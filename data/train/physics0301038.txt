    "fragmentation in finite systems offers a convenient way to investigate their physical and chemical properties . in this respect atomic and molecular clusters have received a great deal of attention , and experimental measurements of structural@xcite or electronic@xcite data have been reported using unimolecular dissociation analyses . in particular",
    ", the relative stability of a cluster is commonly characterized by its dissociation energies , giving rise to the well known `` magic numbers '' in the mass spectra.@xcite recently , fragmentation has been employed to probe thermodynamical properties on a more global scale , with a focus at phase transitions .",
    "haberland and coworkers have used photoabsorption induced fragmentation to extract caloric curves in charged sodium clusters accross the solid - liquid phase change.@xcite they have also extended their measurements to probe the liquid - vapor phase change.@xcite at the same time , gobet and coworkers used event - by - event data analyses of multifragmentation in h@xmath4(h@xmath5)@xmath6 clusters induced by collisions with a helium target,@xcite showing a small backbending in the caloric curve .",
    "et al . _ also found some evidences of the liquid - gas transition in small strontium clusters from the shape of the kinetic energy release distribution subsequent to photoexcitation.@xcite    the possible correlations between statistical fragmentation and phase transitions have found theoretical supports in cluster physics,@xcite but also in nuclear physics.@xcite decaying nuclei resulting from collisions@xcite typically show features due to a very large energy deposit , where multiple fast fragments are emitted on a short time scale . in this case , the main concern is to characterize the distribution of the fragments , and the size of the remaining droplet .",
    "in suitable situations , fisher s formula@xcite gives a correct account of the mass distribution measured in experiments .",
    "atomic clusters are usually treated much more gently , by adding a small amount of excitation energy .",
    "only a very few atoms undergo dissociation , and the evaporative process can take place over long time scales . for example , large weakly bound rare - gas clusters can exhibit extremely small rate constants if their excitation energy lies not far above the dissociation threshold , because the time required for the excitation energy to be located on the few dissociative modes rises sharply as the cluster size increases . in these systems , one is more interested by a complete characterization of the evaporation event itself , with a single ejected atom involved .",
    "two observables carry most of the useful information , namely the dissociation rate and the kinetic energy release ( ker ) distribution .",
    "weerasinghe and amar ( wa)@xcite theoretically investigated in great details the evaporation process in small argon clusters .",
    "their results show that the evaporation rate , and even more the average ker , can be used as a probe of the solidlike - liquidlike phase change in the parent cluster.@xcite to achieve this result , they compared various statistical theories of unimolecular dissociation to the outcome of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , below the energy range where md becomes prohibitive .",
    "one of their conclusions is that phase space theory ( pst ) , in the sense of chesnavitch and bowers,@xcite is able to describe accurately the full evaporation statistics in ar@xmath7 clusters , while simpler theories such as the rice - ramsperger - kassel ( rrk ) model@xcite or the weisskopf - engelking formula@xcite only produce correct orders of magnitude.@xcite some important features , including the nonlinear variation of average ker with increasing excitation energy , are completely absent from the predictions of these approximate models .",
    "comparable methods have been applied by peslherbe and hase to the dissociation in small aluminium clusters,@xcite leading to similar conclusions .",
    "brchignac and coworkers recently reported time - of - flight mass spectrometry measurements of evaporating na@xmath8 clusters.@xcite a careful interpretation of these results necessitated the partitioning of the translational and rotational kinetic energy released , because only the former is actually measured .",
    "the possible angular momentum of the parent cluster is a problem , since rotation can strongly alter the evaporation dynamics , hence the statistical observables . up to now",
    ", only few theoretical works have been devoted to the dynamics of rotating clusters .",
    "structural properties and angular momentum driven isomerizations were first investigated by jellinek and li.@xcite using simple statistical theories , miller and wales further investigated static and evaporation properties on the effective rovibrational potential energy surface ( pes).@xcite the influence of angular momentum on cluster thermodynamics@xcite and chaotic dynamics@xcite also received some attention .",
    "evaporation in rotating clusters had been previously investigated by stace using simple models in the framework of phase space theory.@xcite the calculations made by this author showed that angular momentum tends to increase in small clusters after evaporation ( rotational heating ) , while it tends to decrease in large clusters ( rotational cooling ) .",
    "these effects have been partly observed in the md simulations performed by weerasinghe and amar.@xcite    as seen from the success of phase space theory to describe evaporation in nonrotating clusters,@xcite it is highly desirable to extend this work to the case of finite angular momenta .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper . in the next section ,",
    "we give the basic pst formalism needed to calculate the rotational density of states , in the sphere@xmath0atom approximation .",
    "exact results are obtained for a radial interaction potential having the form @xmath1 , and we provide further details about the numerical implementation of the method in the more general case of a @xmath9 interaction .",
    "the other computational ingredients include the estimation of the vibrational density of states as well as the radial interaction potential .",
    "we also carry out some md simulations to be used as a benchmark for testing the predictions of pst .",

    "in this section , we work out the main expressions for the distribution of kinetic energy released during evaporation of rotating polyatomic molecules . conservation of angular momentum @xmath10 is rigorously included in the phase space theory.@xcite this is particularly important when treating rotating systems with prescribed values of @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , pst is built upon the hypothesis of a loose transition state , i.e. the products are the transition state . in rotating clusters ,",
    "the centrifugal barrier previously explicitely considered by miller and wales,@xcite is naturally accounted for in pst .",
    "here we consider a parent cluster characterized by a rotational angular momentum @xmath10 and a total rovibrational energy @xmath11 .",

    "the absolute rate constant obtained from integrating @xmath15 with respect to @xmath26 thus requires a more substantial effort than any data related to the ker . in the remainder of this section , we focus on the rotational density of states .",
    "the vibrational quantities are relatively easy to compute , and they will be dealt with later .    the calculation of the @xmath27 function is directly linked to the energetics and angular momentum constraints during dissociation .",
    "our main assumption will be to treat the evaporative system lj@xmath28lj@xmath29lj as well represented by a sphere@xmath0atom model .",
    "then the product cluster lj@xmath7 has a unique rotational constant @xmath30 . in this case ,",
    "chesnavitch and bowers have shown that the rotational density of states can be calculated as@xcite ( , j)=_s ( _ r^*,j_r)dj_rdl , [ eq : gamma4 ] where @xmath31 stands for the upper limit of the rotational energy , @xmath32 for the orbital angular momentum of the products .",

    "the radial potential was either taken with @xmath156 or with finite @xmath113 , and in the latter case , two temperatures were taken , corresponding to either the rigid case ( @xmath161 ) or to the liquid case ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath113 , @xmath112 and @xmath30 implicitely depend on these approximations . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav13_j ] , all three approximations perform quite well . looking more closely , we notice that the pst calculation at low temperature overestimates @xmath24 , and that the approximation @xmath156 leads to a slightly diverging ker above @xmath163 .",
    "actually , only the calculation at finite @xmath113 and temperature close to the melting point remains quantitatively close to the simulation data in the entire range of @xmath11 .",
    "this is not so surprising , because the simulation takes place at rather large internal energies , where the cluster is in a liquidlike state . at low temperature ,",
    "the average rotational constant is larger ( see table  [ tab : c6r0 ] ) .",
    "therefore the rotational contribution to @xmath13 is overestimated , which explains the relatively high values of @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav13_j ]",
    ". another possible cause could be the less attractive interaction potential at this low temperature ( see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vradial ] ) , resulting in higher centrifugal barriers , hence a further shift of @xmath13 to a larger value .",
    "the variations of the average ker as a function of internal energy are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav13_e ] for the same three values of angular momentum , @xmath145 , @xmath164 , and @xmath158 lj units .",
    "the results of the pst calculations are represented in the energy range where an inflection occurs due to the melting phase change in lj@xmath147.@xcite the excitation energy where this inflection takes place show a weak dependence over the radial potential used , as well as a nearly constant value with increasing @xmath10 . as angular momentum increases",
    ", the average ker also increases , following the expected scaling law @xmath165 .",
    "looking now at the differences between the pst calculations , we notice that the use of the @xmath166 radial potential overestimates the average energy released , more and more as @xmath10 increases .",
    "this quantitative difference can be explained from the differences in the rdos , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma13 ] . for excitation energies",
    "@xmath167 , @xmath24 is less than about 1 . in this range",
    ", the energy shift @xmath77 plays a crucial role , and its overestimation with the @xmath156 approximation is consistent with the larger average kinetic energy released in fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav13_e ] .    because fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav13_j ] does not confidently discriminates between the various approximations used in our application of pst , we turn to the probability distribution of @xmath13 at given total energy and angular momentum of the parent cluster , which carries more precise information . in fig .  [",
    "fig : dist13 ] we have represented these distributions obtained from md simulations and from pst , with the two radial potentials either with @xmath156 and @xmath155 or with the potential extracted from simulations close to the melting point .",
    "the results are given for @xmath145 and @xmath168 lj units .",
    "as can be observed on the upper panel of this figure , the agreement between md and pst is excellent at @xmath145 , and the two pst calculations give very similar data .",
    "the rotational density of states roughly shows linear variations upon increasing @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma13 ] .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav13_j ] the probability densities computed using the explicit linear approximation @xmath169 .",
    "actually the slope constant @xmath170 does not play any role in the ker distribution .",
    "this linear weisskopf - like behavior@xcite leads to slight shift of the distribution toward higher energies .",
    "a nonzero angular momentum appears as a more stringent test for the statistical theory , as we see on the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dist13 ] that the agreement between md and pst is significantly better with the calculation performed using the radial potential corresponding to @xmath122 .",
    "this is consistent with the better agreement previously observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : eav13 ] . in particular , the threshold value @xmath77 of @xmath13 at which the probability suddenly rises ( near @xmath171 lj unit ) is well reproduced by pst at @xmath122 , but is not in the approximation @xmath156 .",
    "evaporations from rotating clusters are characterized by a nonzero value of this threshold , which is due to the extra excitation energy needed for the system to overcome the larger centrifugal barrier .",
    "the influence of the shape of the rotational density of states on the probability distribution of @xmath13 is also investigated using the linear approximation .",
    "the difference with previous pst calculations is more significant , which indicates the strong influence of the shape of the rdos in the vicinity of @xmath77 .",
    "finally , we have represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : jav13 ] the average final angular momentum @xmath12 of the product cluster as a function of the initial @xmath10 , at two total internal energies , from molecular dynamics simulations . on this figure",
    "the line @xmath172 is also drawn . depending on the initial angular momentum ,",
    "the product cluster can gain or lose some of its rotational velocity .",
    "these rotational cooling and rotational heating effects occur for @xmath173 lj units and @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "the threshold value @xmath175 weakly depends on the total internal energy , in the rather limited range investigated here.@xcite this can be understood using the following simple arguments . at low @xmath10 , evaporating an atom induces an orbital momentum @xmath176 , which is nearly balanced by the angular momentum @xmath177 .",
    "hence angular momentum increases for initially small values of @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "rapidly rotating clusters lose a part of their angular velocity by emitting one atom , and @xmath10 tends to decrease upon evaporation .",
    "we now turn to the evaporation statistics in the smaller lj@xmath3 cluster .",
    "the product cluster lj@xmath143 is nonspherical not only in its lowest energy structure , but also in any of his three other stable isomers .",
    "the average kinetic energy released during dissociation is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav7_j ] versus the total angular momentum of the parent cluster @xmath10 .",
    "the values plotted are the results of md simulations as well as the predictions of pst under various approximations concerning the radial potential . as in the previous paragraph",
    ", we have considered the simple @xmath117 case with @xmath155 , and two more realistic potentials extracted from monte carlo simulations at @xmath161 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "the latter value is close to the isomerization point in this system .",
    "the effective rotational constant was taken as the average over the different instantaneous values at the corresponding temperatures .",
    "they are also given in table  [ tab : c6r0 ] .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ fig : etrav13_j ] , the general agreement between md and pst is good , but we notice that the discrepancy is larger for the pst calculation with @xmath156 .",
    "the effect of temperature on the radial potential is weak in this case .",
    "this may be partly due to the lower melting point of this system , but should be correlated with the similar radial potentials felt by the leaving atom , as represented in fig .  [",
    "fig : vradial ] .",
    "the probability distribution of kinetic energy released is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist7 ] at the total energy @xmath180 lj units , and at zero or nonzero angular momentum of the parent cluster . as was the case for the bigger cluster",
    ", pst reproduces very accurately the results of md simulations at @xmath145 , and the two calculations with the different radial potentials yield essentially similar data .",
    "in contrast , the distributions at @xmath181 differs somewhat from the simulation results . in particular",
    ", the general shape predicted by pst is too sharp with respect to md , and the value of @xmath13 where the probability starts to increase is too high by about 50% .",
    "this error further increases when using the alternative radial potential corresponding to @xmath156 .",
    "the discrepancies observed here should be mainly due to the erroneous assumption of a spherical product .",
    "nevertheless , the global behaviors of both the ker and its probability distribution remain correctly reproduced by phase space theory , indicating that this statistical approach captures all the important physical and chemical ingredients of unimolecular dissociation in weakly bound systems , especially the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "unimolecular decay in large atomic systems is easily treated using simple theories such as the rrkm or weisskopf - engelking statistical approaches .",
    "phase space theory not only includes possible anharmonic effects , but also the rigorous constraints on angular momentum , through general expressions for the differential rates of dissociation .",
    "weerasinghe and amar@xcite were the first to show clearly that pst is qualitatively and quantitatively accurate in predicting rate constants and energetic distributions in the evaporation of nonrotating atomic clusters .",
    "building upon their seminal paper , we have extended their work to the more general case of a finite angular momentum in the parent cluster . for this",
    "we calculated exactly the rotational density of states in the case of an interaction between the product cluster and the dissociating atom having the form @xmath1 .",
    "the implementation to other forms has also been given .",
    "the anharmonic vibrational densities of states were calculated using monte carlo simulations on the effective rovibrational energy surface,@xcite and the radial potential was calculated using an extension of the recent wang - landau algorithm.@xcite    we have tested the applicability of pst to the case of unimolecular evaporation in the lj@xmath2 and lj@xmath3 clusters .",
    "these two different cases allow us to question the hypothesis of a sphere@xmath0atom collision underlying the statistical formalism .",
    "we have shown that pst was quantitatively accurate in predicting the distribution and average value of the kinetic energy released during dissociation , especially after considering the radial potential calculated at temperatures close to the melting point , where dissociation actually occurs on the time scale of md .",
    "taking the simple form @xmath166 introduces some extra errors , in particular at large energies and angular momenta .",
    "we have also seen that dissociation in lj@xmath3 was less well described using pst in the sphere@xmath182atom assumption . beyond this approximation , one could generalize the present formalism to the case of ellipsoid or even triaxial shapes .",
    "extension to molecular systems is also possible , provided that the internal degrees of freedom of the dissociating molecule are correctly accounted for .    to bridge the gap between the results obtained in the present work and the experimental concerns",
    ", one must extract the separate translational and rotational contributions to the total kinetic energy released during evaporation .",
    "this separation was achieved previously in the case of nonrotating parent clusters.@xcite as a first step , it would be useful to extend the present effort to the characterization of the angular momenta distribution after dissociation of an initially rotating system .",
    "the starting distribution of @xmath10 could there be either a delta function ( as in the present work ) or a thermalized boltzmann distribution @xmath183 .",
