    "last years the problems of sliding friction of smooth solid surfaces with thin lubricant film between them attract considerable attention @xcite .",
    "experimental study of atomically flat surfaces of mica , separated by ultrathin lubricant film , has shown that it manifests the properties of solid at certain conditions @xcite . particularly , the interrupted motion ( stick - slip ) was observed inherent to dry friction @xcite .",
    "such boundary mode is realized , if film of lubricating material has less than four molecular layers .",
    "this is explained as solidification conditioned by the compression of walls .",
    "subsequent jump - like melting takes place , when shear stress exceeds a critical value due to `` shear melting effect '' .",
    "these films are characterized by a yield stress , which is a characteristic of failure in solids .    in the previous work @xcite the approach",
    "is developed according to which the transition of ultrathin lubricant film from solid - like to liquid - like state takes place as a result of thermodynamic and shear melting .",
    "the combined analytical description of these processes is carried out due to self - organization of the fields of shear stresses and strain , and also temperature of lubricant film taking into account additive noises of the indicated quantities @xcite and correlated fluctuations of temperature @xcite .",
    "the influence of additive noises on phase kinetics of the system is analyzed @xcite .",
    "however , there a question was not considered about the reasons for the jump - like melting and hysteresis , which were observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the proposed work is devoted to finding of realization conditions of these features taking into account the deformational defect of the shear modulus .",
    "our approach is based on the lorentz model for approximation of viscoelastic medium @xcite at the conditions when the first - order phase transition is realized .",
    "three stationary mode are found  two solid - like , corresponding to dry friction , and one liquid - like , meeting the sliding .",
    "the phase portraits of the system are built .",
    "the various interrupted modes of friction depending on initial conditions until setting of equilibrium can be realized .",
    "it is also shown that in the case , when relaxation time of strain much longer than corresponding times for stresses and temperature , the hysteresis is manifested in phase portraits .",
    "in the previous work @xcite on the basis of rheological description of viscoelastic medium , possessing heat conductivity , the system of kinetic equations is obtained , which determine the mutually coordinated behavior of shear stresses @xmath0 and strain @xmath1 , and also temperature @xmath2 in ultrathin lubricant film during the process of friction between atomically flat mica surfaces .",
    "let us write down these equations using the measure units : @xmath3 for variables @xmath4 , respectively , where @xmath5 is the mass density , @xmath6 is the specific heat capacity , @xmath7 is the critical temperature , @xmath8 is the characteristic value of shear viscosity @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the time of heat conductivity , @xmath11 is the scale of heat conductivity , @xmath12 is the coefficient of heat conductivity , @xmath13 is the relaxation time of strain , @xmath14 : @xmath15 here the relaxation time of stress @xmath16 , the temperature @xmath17 of atomically flat mica surfaces of friction , and the function @xmath18 are introduced , where @xmath19 is the shear modulus of lubricant depending on the stress value : @xmath20 at @xmath21 equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is reduced to the maxwell - type equation for description of viscoelastic medium by substituting @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the maxwell equation supposes the use of the idealized genky model . for the dependence of stress on strain @xmath24 this model",
    "is represented by the hooke law @xmath25 at @xmath26 and constant @xmath27 at @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the maximal values of shear stress and strain for the hooke section , @xmath31 results in the viscous flow with deformation rate @xmath32 ) . actually , the curve of dependence @xmath24 has two regions : first one , hookean , has the large slope determined by the shear modulus @xmath33 , and it is followed by the more gently sloping section of plastic deformation whose tilt is defined by the hardening factor @xmath34 .",
    "obviously , the above picture means that the shear modulus depends on the value of stresses . for the account of this circumstance we use the simplest approximation ( [ nn ] ) , which describes the above represented transition of elastic deformation mode to the plastic one .",
    "it takes place at the characteristic values of shear stress @xmath35 and strain @xmath36 .",
    "it is worth noting that at description of structural phase transitions of liquid - like lubricant the third - order invariants are present , which breaks the parity of the dependence of the synergetic potential @xmath37 on the stress @xmath0 .",
    "therefore in approximation ( [ nn ] ) the linear term was used @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , instead of square one @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) @xcite , and dependence @xmath42 was not already even @xcite .    expression ( [ eq2 ] ) has the form of the corresponding kelvin - voight equation @xcite , which takes into account the dependence of the shear viscosity on the dimensionless temperature @xmath43 note that jointly equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) represent the new rheological model , since they are reduced to the second - order differential equation with respect to the stress @xmath0 or the strain @xmath1 .",
    "equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is the expression for heat conductivity , which describes the transmission of heat from the friction surfaces to lubricant film , the effect of dissipative heating of viscous liquid flowing under the action of stress , and the reversible mechanic - and - caloric effect in linear approximation .",
    "equations ( [ eq1 ] )  ( [ eq3 ] ) formally coincide with the synergetic lorentz system @xcite , in which the shear stress acts as the order parameter , the conjugate field is reduced to the shear strain , and the temperature represents the control parameter .",
    "as is known this system is used for description of both phase thermodynamic and kinetic transformations .",
    "it is necessary also to note that rheological properties of lubricant film are investigated experimentally that allows to build a phase diagram @xcite .",
    "dependence ( [ nn ] ) describes hysteresis at melting of thin layer of lubricant only in coordinates @xmath44 during realization of first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus , deformation curve @xmath45 is monotonous and in the case of second - order phase transition it allows us to represent only continuous transition .",
    "however , experimental data testify that melting of molecularly thin lubricant film has jump - like character @xcite , though may take place according to the mechanism of second - order phase transition .",
    "as is shown below the description of the indicated feature is achieved replacing dependence @xmath46 in ( [ eq1 ] ) by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 at this time the value of parameter @xmath49 , determining the potential character , plays a key role also .    in the work @xcite the melting of ultrathin lubricant film during the process of friction between the atomically flat surfaces of mica represented as a result of spontaneous appearance of shear stresses resulting in plastic flow .",
    "this is caused by heating of friction surfaces above the critical value @xmath50 .",
    "the initial reason for self - organization process is the positive feedback of @xmath2 and @xmath0 on @xmath1 [ see ( [ eq2 ] ) ] , conditioned by temperature dependence of shear viscosity leading to its divergence . on the other hand",
    ", the negative feedback of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath2 in ( [ eq3 ] ) has an important role since it provides the system stability .    in accordance with such approach",
    "the lubricant represents a strongly viscous liquid , which behaves like an amorphous solid  has large effective viscosity and is still characterized by the yield stress @xcite .",
    "the solid - like state of lubricant corresponds to the shear stress @xmath51 , since in this case equation ( [ eq1 ] ) falls out of consideration .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , containing the viscous stresses , is reduced to the debye law representing the rapid relaxation of shear strain during microscopic time @xmath52 s , where @xmath53  nm is the lattice constant or the intermolecular distance and @xmath54  m / s is the sound velocity .",
    "thus , equation of heat conductivity ( [ eq3 ] ) assumes the form of simplest expression for temperature relaxation , which does not contain the terms representing dissipative heating and mechanic - and - caloric effect of viscous liquid .",
    "equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) describes the flow of lubricant with velocity @xmath55 due to action of appearing viscous shear stress .",
    "moreover , in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite in the absence of shear deformations the temperature mean - square displacement of molecules ( atoms ) is defined by equality @xmath56 .",
    "the average shear displacement is found from the relationship @xmath57 .",
    "the total mean - square displacement represents the sum of these expressions provided that the thermal fluctuations and the stress are independent . above",
    "implies that the melting of lubricant is induced both by heating and influence of stress generated by solid surfaces in the course of friction @xcite .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the plastic flow of lubricant layer is realized at presence of elastic stress . the action of shear stress results to reducing of shear modulus of lubricating material .",
    "consequently , the friction force decreases with increasing velocity at the contact @xmath55 because the latter leads to the growth of the shear stress according to the maxwell stress - strain @xmath1 relationship : @xmath58 it is assumed that the film becomes more liquid - like and the friction force decreases with the temperature growth due to decreasing activation energy barrier to molecular hops .",
    "let us consider the stationary states , at which the all derivatives in equations ( [ eq1 ] )  ( [ eq3 ] ) are equal to the zero , and values @xmath59 do not change in the lubricant .",
    "then the first of these equations leads to the law similar to the hooke one : @xmath60 where parameter @xmath61 , determining the ratio of the tilts for the deformation curve on the plastic and the hookean regions , coefficients @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are introduced .    dependence ( [ hooke ] ) at fixed @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is depictured in fig .",
    "it is apparent from here that two situations can be realized : at small @xmath67 the curve @xmath45 increases monotonically ( insert in the figure ) , and at @xmath68 it becomes non - monotonous . in the first case in accordance with the figure the continuous melting of lubricant takes place , in the second one",
    " lubricant melts abruptly at the increase of stresses to the point @xmath69 , and here the transition to point @xmath70 occurs . at the further growth of the stresses",
    "the strain increases monotonically , and lubricant is liquid - like . if stress is decreased now to the point @xmath71 lubricant conserves liquid - like structure , and then it abruptly becomes solid during transition at point @xmath72 . at the subsequent decrease of stresses lubricant",
    "is solid - like .",
    "similar transitions are represented as the first - order phase transitions @xcite , but between the states , which are not the pure thermodynamic phases . for understanding of these transformations the concept of shear melting",
    "is used @xcite . note that such hysteresis behavior was observed in the experiments @xcite .    using ( [ hooke ] )",
    ", it is possible to find the abscissas of transition points @xmath69 and @xmath71 : @xmath73^{1/\\beta } , ~ b = \\theta^{-1 } - 1 ,   \\label{epsac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sign - corresponds to the point @xmath69 , and sign +  to the point @xmath71 . from eq .",
    "( [ epsac ] ) it is seen that the length of jump at melting increases with growth @xmath64 , and the difference @xmath74 with the increase of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , at large @xmath67 ( small @xmath64 ) melting and solidification occur at the same value of strain ( @xmath75 ) practically , but at different values of stresses @xmath0 . as well as in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , we will accept as the order parameter the shear stress @xmath0 : at @xmath76 lubricant is liquid - like , and if @xmath77 it is solid - like . in the intermediate region @xmath78 the state of lubricant is unstable , since it may exist in both phases .",
    "the dependence of the stationary shear stresses @xmath79 on the temperature of friction surfaces @xmath17 is presented in fig .  2 at parameters of fig . 1 ( fig",
    "2b meets the insert in fig .",
    "1 ) . apparently that it is non - monotonous , and in the interval @xmath80 the two - valued section is realized inherent to first - order phase transitions .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the unstable stationary values of stresses @xmath81 , the solid curve  to the stable @xmath82 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath83 meets the hookean section of dependence @xmath84 .    for further consideration",
    "it is necessary to write down expression for synergetic potential @xmath42 . within the framework of adiabatic approximation @xmath85",
    "@xcite it is possible to set @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and equations ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) give @xmath88 after substitution of expression ( [ adiabat_eps ] ) in ( [ eq1 ] ) we obtain the landau - khalatnikov equation : @xmath89 where the synergetic potential is defined by equality @xmath90 \\left[1+\\frac{\\theta^{-1}-1}{1+\\left ( \\sigma/\\alpha - \\sigma(2-t_e)/(\\alpha+\\alpha\\sigma^2 ) \\right)^\\beta}\\right ] d\\sigma . \\label{potential}\\ ] ] note that in the region @xmath91 this potential does not give correct result , since here the model has the unstable solution , describing the decrease of stresses with growth of strain , and this does not take into account hysteresis . for finding the form of potential in the indicated region",
    "we replace ( [ eq1 ] ) by equation : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the value of the conserved stresses . in the corresponding landau - khalatnikov equation ( [ lanhal ] )",
    "the potential is fixed by expression : @xmath94 it is seen that @xmath95 depends only on @xmath0 , i.e. in the situation , where stress is conserved at the change of temperature , the value @xmath95 remains constant .",
    "the dependence of the potential ( [ potential ] ) on the stress value at the fixed temperatures of friction surfaces is presented in fig .  3 corresponding to the parameters of fig .",
    "the hysteresis , shown in fig .",
    "1 , is realized in this situation .",
    "we will consider this case in more detail .",
    "below than the critical value @xmath96 stresses are absent in lubricant ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the form of potential , shown by curve 1 in fig .",
    "3 , corresponds to this interval of temperatures .",
    "here one zero minimum is realized at @xmath97 , thus lubricant is solid - like . at point",
    "@xmath98 a plateau appears on the dependence @xmath42 ( curve 2 ) . with the further increase of temperature in a region",
    "@xmath99 the potential has the form shown by curve 3 . here the potential barrier appears , which separates the zero and non - zero minimums of potential . in connection with it",
    "the system can not come in the stable state @xmath100 , and the zero value of shear stress @xmath0 is realized . the dashed curve in fig .",
    "2a corresponds to the maximum of potential , the solid curve  to its non - zero minimum . as is apparent from figure at @xmath101 the jump - like increase of value @xmath0 takes place , and the system turns to the section of dependence @xmath102 ( point @xmath103 ) .",
    "this transition is caused by that at @xmath101 the maximum @xmath42 disappears , and with subsequent growth of @xmath17 the one non - zero minimum of potential is realized ( curve 4 in fig .",
    "the expression for the critical temperature @xmath104 is obtained from the condition @xmath105 , where @xmath37 is the synergetic potential ( [ potential ] ) : @xmath106 however , section @xmath107 is unstable , because here the stress is decreased at growth of strain ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 meet the similar points in fig .",
    "1 ) . in this connection",
    "further the system goes on the way @xmath103  @xmath108 ( this transition is already described by potential @xmath95 ( [ potential_stat ] ) , since stress is conserved ) , and passes to the plastic flow section , which corresponds to the liquid - like structure of lubricant . with the subsequent increase of temperature @xmath17",
    "the stationary value of stresses @xmath82 grows , and lubricant becomes less viscous , here @xmath42 has the form shown by curve 4 .",
    "if now the temperature of friction surfaces is decreased , the lubricant is liquid - like to the value @xmath109 , further the stress is conserved to the critical @xmath110 ( corresponding to the point @xmath69 ) , but it is unstable . therefore it is necessary to introduce the described hysteresis , and to take into account that at this transition the system is described by potential @xmath111 ( [ potential_stat ] ) . ] . as is seen from the insert in the picture at @xmath110 the system passes to the point @xmath69 , because here the dependence @xmath102 becomes stable . at this transition system of somehow ",
    "jump over  the potential barrier ( dashed curve of dependence ) .",
    "it is related to that before the jump the system is described by other potential @xmath95 , which is characterized by absence of barrier . here the solidification of lubricant occurs , because transition takes place on the stable part of hooke section ( according to fig .",
    "1 temperature @xmath112 corresponds to the hooke domain ) .",
    "now , the system is described by potential @xmath42 ( [ potential ] ) with the barrier shown by curve 3 in fig .",
    "3 . with the further decrease of the temperature of friction surfaces at the point",
    "@xmath113 stresses decrease abruptly to the zero , since the barrier disappears and there is one zero minimum of @xmath42 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the solid - like state of lubricant also , but with the zero value of stress .",
    "it is supposed that the solid - like states at @xmath97 and @xmath100 differ by structure , because of transition between them takes place according to the mechanism of the first - order phase transition .",
    "thus , the solid - like structure of lubricant at a temperature below @xmath96 is similar to the solid state , and the solid - like structure above indicated temperature has the signs of the liquid state , but lubricant behaves as a solid - like on the whole .",
    "the different solid - like states correspond to the different modes of friction in the studied system @xcite . at further transition to the liquid mode of friction the viscosity of lubricant ( [ visc ] ) decreases , and it flows .    at described transitions the stationary values of stresses are conserved in intervals @xmath114 and @xmath91 .",
    "obviously , that equality @xmath115 is satisfied with the increase of temperature at @xmath114 , since it is necessary to give some energy to lubricant for melting .",
    "conservation of stresses in the region @xmath91 at decrease of the sheared surfaces temperature takes place , because for transition of lubricant in the solid - like state it has to return energy .",
    "it is worth noting that at the conservation of stresses between solid - like and liquid - like phases of lubricant , it is in the intermediate state with differing from them structure .",
    "the situation , which is given by the insert to the figure 1 , is shown in fig .",
    "2b when hysteresis is not realized in coordinates @xmath84 .",
    "this corresponds to the more simple case described in work @xcite . below the value @xmath104",
    "we have the solid - like state of lubricant ( @xmath97 ) , at @xmath116 it melts at transition to the plastic flow region , and with the subsequent increase of @xmath17 it becomes more liquid .",
    "then , with the decrease of temperature to the value @xmath96 lubricant is liquid - like ( @xmath117 ) , at @xmath98 it solidifies abruptly ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the distinctive feature of such behavior is that whole hooke domain is unstable , since it meets the maximum of potential .",
    "there is only one type of solid - like state of lubricant with the zero value of stress .",
    "depending on the parameters of the system there the second - order phase transition can be observed , when the temperature @xmath104 is moved on the left - hand side from @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , the unstable stationary values of stresses @xmath81 are not realized , and hysteresis disappears , which is characterized by a presence of @xmath96 . in this case",
    "the potential , shown by curve 1 in fig .",
    "3 , corresponds to the solid - like structure of lubricant , which is transformed to the form represented by curve 4 with the increase of temperature .",
    "thus , the continuous transformation takes place , since the potential barrier is absent .",
    "here it is also possible to select two situations  when hysteresis of @xmath84 dependence is observed , and without it @xcite .",
    "in accordance with the experimental data for organic lubricating materials @xcite the relaxation time of stresses at normal pressure is @xmath118  s. since ultrathin lubricant film has less than four molecular layers , temperature relaxes to the value @xmath17 during time satisfying the condition : @xmath119 according to this we will assume in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath87 . also for convenience the time is measured in units of @xmath16 . as a result",
    ", we will obtain the two - parameter system in the form : @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "the corresponding phase portraits are presented in figs .  4  6 at the parameters of figure 2a for different @xmath17 .",
    "the phase portraits describing the behavior of lubricant in the solid - like state ( @xmath122 ) are shown in fig .  4 for different ratios of relaxation times .",
    "particularly , fig .",
    "4a corresponds to the value @xmath123 .",
    "the isoclines obtained at equating to zero of derivatives in the equations ( [ eq1_new1 ] ) and ( [ eq2_new1 ] ) are shown by dashed curves 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "thus , curve 1 meets the system parameters at which stresses do not change , and line 2 corresponds to the case of strain conservation .",
    "these lines intersect at the origin of coordinates forming the unique stationary point @xmath72 , which is a node .",
    "it is apparent that phase trajectories converge to the node @xmath72 , i.e. stresses relax to the zero value .",
    "thus , at motion on a phase plane at the arbitrary initial conditions there are two stages : on the first one , the instantaneous relaxation of the system takes place to the line near to isocline 2 , on the second one  the slow motion on the indicated curve . at the first stage",
    "the stresses are conserved that reminds the transition between the friction modes described in section  [ sec : level2 ] .",
    "apparently , on the final stage of system relaxation to the stationary point @xmath72 the values of stress and strain go out in the negative domain .",
    "this can be interpreted as reversible motion at which the top wall of friction moves in reverse direction .",
    "thus , stresses change the sign in opposite one , because of the direction of motion changes , and strain becomes negative also . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to neglect the negative region , considering it as has no physical meaning .",
    "we can assume that at achievement by strain the zero value the system abruptly goes to the origin of coordinates , and the equilibrium sets in @xcite .    the phase portrait shown in fig .",
    "4b is built for the case when relaxation times of stresses and strain coincide @xmath124 .",
    "it is also characterized by the singular point @xmath72 , representing the node around which the weakly pronounced oscillations of short durations are realized now till setting of equilibrium . here",
    "the cases are possible when stress @xmath0 at first increases , and then decreases , and reverse situation .",
    "it means that to that moment , when the system will come to the equilibrium ( the origin of the coordinates ) , the stick - slip motion is possible .",
    "for example , in accordance with phase trajectories , which begin at @xmath51 , the lubricant is solid - like at first ( stresses are equal to zero ) , then it begins to melt ( stresses increase ) , and then it solidifies again ( at setting of equilibrium ) . in order to avoid misunderstanding let us turn attention to the following circumstance . according to phase trajectories the cases are possible when with the growth of stresses the strain decreases .",
    "above for the stationary values of stresses it was interpreted as instability resulting in hysteresis .",
    "now , the rapid motion is realized .",
    "it allows us to assume that system is in the unstable state , and oscillation mode is realized in which the decrease of @xmath1 is possible with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  4c meets the case @xmath125 . here , as well as in fig .  4a",
    ", the two stages are selected : the rapid relaxation to the line near to isocline 1 , and further the slow motion along it . at the first stage",
    "the strain changes weakly , and stresses decrease very rapidly , if their initial values are on the right - hand side from isocline 1 , or they increase at initial @xmath0 on the left - hand side from it . at the second stage in the top part of phase portrait the configuration point moves along the plastic section , and in bottom one  along the hooke domain . during the way of this point between the maximum and minimum of isocline 1 stresses increase with decrease of strain .",
    "the motion is slow here , and therefore the hysteresis has to be observed similar to described in fig .",
    "this feature is not shown in phase portrait , and its study requires the additional analysis , because there a lot of limiting cases can arise , which are not considered within the framework of the offered work .    the phase portraits in fig .",
    "5 are presented for the same parameters and ratios of relaxation times as in fig .",
    "but they are built for the temperature corresponding to the section of fig .",
    "2a , for which stable and unstable stationary values of shear stresses are realized ( @xmath80 ) . in this case",
    "the system potential has the form shown by curve 3 in fig .",
    "3 . as well as",
    "above , lines 1 and 2 are isoclines .",
    "the phase portraits are characterized by three singular points : by the node @xmath72 at the origin of coordinates , which describes the dry friction ; by the saddle @xmath126 corresponding to the maximum of dependence @xmath42 ( the unstable stationary point ) ; by the node @xmath127 meeting the non - zero stationary stress , which corresponds to the unstable section @xmath107 of dependence @xmath102 shown in fig .",
    "these points are given by intersections of isoclines .",
    "depending on the initial conditions the system may come as a result of relaxation both to the mode of stable dry friction ( node @xmath72 ) and to the above described unstable section ( node @xmath127 ) .",
    "at @xmath128 there is the picture shown in fig .",
    "5a . here , as well as in fig .  4a",
    ", phase trajectories rapidly converge to the line near to isocline 2 from any point of phase plane at conservation of stresses .",
    "further the system relaxes to the nodes @xmath72 , or @xmath127 , and determined by these points the stationary modes of friction set in .",
    "the inclination of curve , along which motion occurs during the second stage , depends on initial conditions .",
    "so , the system relaxes to the point @xmath127 along the plastic section of isocline 2 , to the point @xmath72  along its hookean one .",
    "note that in the course of time lubricant becomes more liquid , if @xmath129 , and vice versa more viscous at @xmath130 , where @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 are the initial and the stationary values of stresses . in these cases",

    "4 , 5 , and 6 situations is achieved due to the change of isocline 2 form with the variation of temperature @xmath17 of friction surfaces , while the form of isocline 1 does not depend on it .",
    "the value of @xmath67 influences substantially on the phase portraits , however , its variations do not change qualitatively the character of the system behavior . at @xmath139",
    "it is necessary to introduce hysteresis @xcite , because the slow motion of the system occurs near the isocline 1 , and the condition of stationarity is valid in every time moment .",
    "the hysteresis is similar to described in fig .",
    "1 , since the dependence , presented in this figure , represents isocline 1 shown in phase portraits .",
    "the above consideration shows that the hysteresis , realized at melting of thin lubricant film according to the mechanism of first - order phase transition , can be described taking into account the deformational defect of the shear modulus .",
    "the basic feature of such behavior is that lubricant melts and solidifies at the different values of shear stress , which acts as the order parameter .",
    "the two solid - like states of lubricant and one liquid - like phase have been found , the transition between which takes place in accordance with indicated hysteresis .",
    "the phase kinetics is studied , and depending on initial conditions the different types of stick - slip motion are predicted .",
    "the elastic and thermal parameters of lubricant are defined , at which as a result of this motion the sliding , or the dry friction sets in .",
