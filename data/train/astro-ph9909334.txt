    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are believed to be young neutron stars of high dipolar magnetic field , located in or near their associated supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "a key observation regarding the nature of these objects was the simultaneous detection by  and   of a burst from  ( @xcite ) , which allowed an accurate determination of the burst position .",
    "subsequent observations revealed a persistent x - ray counterpart , located near the center of the young plerionic snr  ( @xcite ) .",
    "further insights into the nature of sgrs came from the detection by  of a very slow pulsation ( 7.47 s ) with a very high spin down from the persistent x - ray counterpart of , implying an extremely strong dipolar magnetic field ( 8 @xmath1 10@xmath2 gauss ) for the neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "this results provided the first strong observational support for the magnetar model of thomson & duncan ( 1995 ) , in which sgrs are young and strongly magnetized neutron stars .",

    "an  observation of  during a bursting phase ( @xcite ) , provided an improved position , and revealed a persistent x - ray counterpart , similar to that of . ,  and  ( @xcite ) detected slow pulsation ( 5.16 s ) from the persistent x - ray counterpart with a very high spin down , giving a dipolar magnetic field of @xmath0 5 @xmath1 10@xmath2 gauss , again supporting the magnetar model .",
    "was discovered with  ( @xcite ) .",
    "its accurate error box , combining measurements from , _ konus - wind _ ,  and  ( @xcite ) contains the snr  ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations with  revealed an x - ray source within the snr , sax  j1635.84736 , with a non thermal x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) and a possible pulsation at 6.41 s. based on the similar properties with other sgrs , it is very likely that they have detected the persistent x - ray counterpart of .    the very high interstellar absorption for  ( woods et al .",
    "1999b ) prompted us to perform millimeter observations in order to determine the source of this extinction .",
    "here , we report observations carried out with the sest telescope , allowing the detection of 8 distinct molecular clouds along the line of sight to .",
    "we show that  and the snr  are both associated with an exceptionally massive gmc at a distance of 11 kpc . we also show that the total extinction along the 11 kpc to the sgr , derived from co and 21 cm observations , is consistent with the foreground extinction derived for the x - ray counterpart .",
    "we then discuss the consequences of this distance on the nature of .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 15 m swedish  eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ) at la silla , chile , on 1999 may 20 .",
    "we observed the central position reported by woods et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "we simultaneously observed two transitions : @xmath3co(j=10 ) and @xmath3co(j=21 ) , at 115.27 and 230.54 ghz respectively ; the j=21 line is shown in figure 1 ( solid line ) .",
    "the fwhm beamwidth of sest is 45  at 115.27 ghz and 23  at 230.54 ghz .",
    "we observed in position switching mode , after checking in frequency switching mode that our off position ( @xmath4(2000 ) = 16h30m02.0s , @xmath5(2000 ) = 462332 ) was free of emission .",
    "the back end was an acousto - optical spectrometer with a frequency bandwidth of 1 ghz and a velocity resolution of 1.8  at 115.27 ghz and 0.9  at 230.54 ghz .",
    "the system was calibrated with the chopper wheel method ; regular observations of calibration sources show that the sest calibration is stable to within a few percent .",
    "the system temperature during the observations was @xmath0 284 k at 115.27 ghz and @xmath0 197 k at 230.54 ghz .",
    "we obtained the 21 cm  spectra ( dotted line in figure 1 ) from the survey of neutral hydrogen in the southern galaxy , observed by kerr et al .",
    "the spectrum used for this study is an average of the two observed spectra closest to , at l = 337 , b = 0  and 0.25  (  is at l= 337.0   and b = 0.1 ) .",
    "as the velocity resolution is slightly better in the @xmath3co(j=21 ) spectrum ( figure 1 ) than the @xmath3co(j=10 ) , we have used it to separate the various molecular clouds along the line of sight to .",
    "the extinction has been derived from the @xmath3co(j=10 ) spectrum .",
    "a total of 8 clouds can be identified .",
    "we label each of them with the acronym mc and its associated velocity in figure 1 .",
    "it is well known that for gas in the inner galaxy , there are two possible distances corresponding to each radial velocity .",
    "the parameters associated with each cloud are displayed in table 1 , using a circular model for the galactic rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "as we are primarily interested in the distribution of extinction along the line of sight , we have estimated the atomic hydrogen column density , taking into account opacity effect , by using the following relation ( @xcite ) : @xmath6 , and taking the usual assumption of t@xmath7 = 125 k for the spin temperature and t@xmath8 = 2.7 k for the cosmic background temperature ; t@xmath9 is the 21 cm line brightness temperature .",
    "molecular hydrogen column density , n(h@xmath10 ) , was derived from velocity integrated  intensity , w(co ) , using a conversion factor , x@xmath11 @xmath12 n(h@xmath10)/w(co ) , of ( 1.9 @xmath13 0.2 ) @xmath1 10@xmath14 mols .",

    "this value was determined by comparing the @xmath16-ray ,  and @xmath3co(j=10 ) emissions from the galaxy ( strong & mattox , 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath3co(j=10 ) transition has been shown to be the best tracer of molecular cloud masses ( @xcite ) , and three different methods have led to a similar value for x@xmath11 ( @xcite ) . the total hydrogen column density , n(h ) , is then n(h ) = n ( ) + 2 n(h@xmath10 ) . we can estimate the total extinction using the following relation ( @xcite ) : = ( 5.6 @xmath13 0.1 ) @xmath1 10@xmath17(h ) .",
    "table 2 gives the extinction for each of the molecular clouds .",
    "in the most supernova remnant catalog ( whiteoak & green 1996 ) ,  has a non thermal spectrum and a peculiar morphology , with several intensity enhancements superposed on a plateau of emission .",
    "it is a member of the ctb 33 complex , which also includes the  regions g  337.10.2 and g  336.8 + 0.0 . using high resolution radio observations , sarma et al .",
    "( 1997 ) clearly resolved the  area into three components : another  region , the supernova remnant  and an edge source .",
    "frail et al . ( 1996 ) detected a maser oh emission line from the snr , , at 71.3 .",
    "as mentioned by sarma et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , this oh line is in agreement with the velocity ( 73 to 75 ) of the recombination lines from the  regions of the ctb  33 complex .",
    "the  absorption profiles ( @xcite ) toward the members of the ctb  33 complex ( including the snr ) show absorption features up to the tangent point , therefore ruling out the near distance . based on the rotation curve model of fich et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , a distance of 11.0 @xmath13 0.3 kpc is deduced for the ctb  33 complex , including the snr  ( @xcite ) .    in the @xmath3co(j=21 )",
    "spectrum toward  ( figure 1 ) , which encompasses the direction of , a gmc is detected at 70.9 , close to the velocity of the components of the ctb  33 complex . in order to image the molecular emission in the vicinity of mc71",
    ", we used the co survey of bronfman et al .",
    "the co map in figure 2 is integrated over the velocity range 80 to 40 , which includes all of the emission from mc71 as well as that from an adjacent cloud at a velocity of 56  ( mc56 ) which may be related ( see below ) .",
    "the coincidence of mc71 in direction and velocity with both the   regions g  337.10.2 and g  336.8 + 0.0 and the snr  strongly suggests that mc71 is the progenitor of the entire ctb 33 complex , which lies at the far kinematic distance of 11 kpc . the radius - linewidth relation for gmcs ( dame et al .",
    "1986 ) also favors the far kinematic distance for mc71 : this gmc has an exceptionally large composite linewidth of @xmath0 19  but a relatively small angular radius of @xmath0 0.35 , corresponding to 28 pc at the near kinematic distance of 4.7 kpc or a more appropriate 67 pc at the far distance . at the far distance",
    ", the co luminosity of mc71 implies a total molecular mass of 4 @xmath1 10@xmath18 , about the same as that of the gmc associated with   ( @xcite ) and comparable to the masses of the half dozen or so largest gmcs in the galaxy ( dame et al .",
    "1986 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that mc71 lies within @xmath0 0.5  and @xmath0 15  of another gmc with very similar observational properties ( size , mass ) .",
    "as figure 2 shows , the gmc labeled mc56 has about the same angular size as mc71 , and its composite linewidth is even larger than that of mc71 ; therefore the far kinematic distance is again strongly favored by the radius - linewidth relation .",
    "both these clouds coincide with a remarkable cluster of   regions discussed by mezger et al .",
    "( 1970  see especially their fig .",
    "2 ) ; they note that the cluster is very restricted in longitude but has a wide velocity spread ( from @xmath0 90 to 30 ) .",
    "it is possible that the abundance of star formation associated with these two gmcs , including , may have resulted from their collision or tidal interaction .",
    "the detection of the mc71 molecular cloud gives a natural explanation for the hydroxyl radical ( oh ) maser detection from snr  by frail et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as these authors pointed out , this maser line is collisionaly excited by the supernova remnant shock going through a molecular cloud .",
    "we note that our distance measurement of 11.0 @xmath13 0.3 kpc for snr  is not consistent with the value of 5.8 kpc derived by case & bhattacharya ( 1998 ) using a new statistical @xmath19d relation .",
    "the total hydrogen column density toward the persistent x - ray counterpart of  is estimated to be ( 7.7 @xmath13 0.8 ) @xmath1 10@xmath20 @xmath15 ( @xcite ) . using the empirical relation of predehl & schmitt ( 1995 )",
    ", this corresponds to an optical extinction of 43.0 @xmath13 3.9 magnitudes .",
    "as the snr  is probably at a distance of 11.0 kpc and associated with mc71 , we will estimate the extinction up to the mc71 cloud . the contribution of each cloud to the extinction",
    "is presented in table 2 .",
    "we note that the intrinsic extinction of mc71 is very high ( @xmath0 40 magnitudes ) .",
    "the five molecular clouds with velocity lower than that of mc71 ( mc122 , mc117 , mc110 , mc97 and mc83 ) must be located in front of it , since both the near and far kinematic distances of these clouds are smaller than the distance of mc71 .",
    "the two clouds at higher velocity , mc41 and mc32 , are apparently also in front of mc71 , at their near kinematic distances , since hydrogen absorption lines at the velocities of these clouds are seen against the radio continuum of the snr  ( @xcite ) .    summing the contributions from all the molecular clouds in front of mc71",
    "yields a total optical extinction of 30.0 @xmath13 1.9 magnitudes .",
    "contribution to the extinction from atomic hydrogen can be estimated as follows .",
    "integrating all  emission from 150  to 0  gives an upper limit of 11.4 magnitudes .",
    "it is possible that part of the  emission from 71  to 0  arises from gas beyond mc71 ; by assuming that half of this  emission is at the near distance and the other half at the far distance , we can deduce a lower limit of 8.0 magnitudes .",
    "therefore , atomic hydrogen adds another 9.7 @xmath13 1.7 magnitudes , giving a total extinction to mc71 of 39.7 @xmath13 2.5 magnitudes , in good agreement with the value 43.0 @xmath13 3.9 mag .",
    "determined for the x - ray counterpart .",
    "since mc71 itself would increase the total extinction to 81.1 @xmath13 4.5 magnitudes , a factor of two above the value derived for sax  j1635.84736 ,  must be located on the near side of mc71 .",
    "the distance to this cloud is obviously the same as that of the ctb  33 complex , i.e.  is at distance from the sun of 11.0 @xmath13 0.3 kpc .",
    "this constitutes the second accurate distance estimate of a sgr .",
    "we should note that the other sgr for which a reasonable distance estimate exists   at 14.5 @xmath13 1.4 kpc ( @xcite )  is also on the edge of a very massive gmc .",
    "this might indicate that these objects are still lying close to their birth sites .",
    "the first detailed observations of  by most ( @xcite ) showed a complex morphology which , as mentioned above , has been resolved into various components by sarma et al .",
    "their observations clearly revealed the intrinsic morphology of this supernova remnant ( fig . 3 in sarma et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) , and therefore provides the best available radio map of .",
    "therefore , the snr map of sarma et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is more appropriate for the study of  than the much more widely used most map .",
    "the angular size ( radius of @xmath0 45 ) of snr  implies a radius of 2.4 pc at a distance of 11.0 kpc .",
    "following kafatos et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , who have studied the expansion of snrs in various environments , the size of  is not in agreement with an expansion into a molecular cloud but is rather typical of a very young snr ( @xmath21 1,000 years ) expanding into the interstellar medium .",
    "this is consistent with our conclusion that  is on the outer edge of mc71 and with the fact that sgrs are believed to be associated with young snr .",
    "the persistent x - ray counterpart ( the center of its associated error box ( @xcite ) ) is located 105 @xmath13 26   away from the projected center of the snr , which corresponds to a displacement of 5.4 pc with our distance estimate of .",
    "a very young snr with an age of 1,000 years would require an unrealistic transverse velocity of 5,400 @xmath13 1,300   to reach this displacement , while a @xmath0 5,000 years old snr would imply a more reasonable velocity of 1,080 @xmath13 270   ( requiring the expansion of the snr into a _ rarefied _",
    "interstellar medium ) .",
    "the latter number seems more likely as high velocity neutron stars have been found with transverse velocities up to @xmath0 1,000  ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is possible that  is a high velocity neutron star escaping the young snr .",
    "these numbers could be refined with an improved position of the x - ray counterpart .",
    "is found to be located on the edge of a very massive gmc at a distance of 11.0 @xmath13 0.3 kpc , with an optical extinction of @xmath0 43 magnitudes .",
    "this is the second sgr located on the outer edge of a very large and massive gmc .",
    "we present evidence for an association with the supernova remnant , which is interacting with the gmc .",
    "the position of  relative to the snr indicates that  is probably escaping the young ( @xmath0 5,000 years ) supernova remnant  with a high transverse velocity ( @xmath0 1,000 ) .    s.c . would like to thank i. grenier for useful discussions on the x@xmath11 factor .",
