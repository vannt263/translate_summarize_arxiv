    "mass is one of the key parameters for neutron star ( ns ) physics and astrophysics .",
    "it can be measured with high precision in binary radio pulsar systems . until very recently",
    "all estimates were obtained in the very narrow region of 1.35 - 1.45  @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these values lie very close to the chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs .",
    "thus , @xmath3 was considered to be the standard value of the ns mass .",
    "recently , the range widened towards lower masses after the discovery of the double pulsar j0737 - 3039 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the nss in this system has @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several other examples are known ( see sec .",
    "the mass range is extended also towards higher masses , although these results are less certain .",
    "there is one ns in a binary radio pulsar system with mass significantly higher than the canonical value @xmath5 .",
    "it is the pulsar j0751 + 1807 with the mass @xmath6 ( 95% confidence level ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "a recent reanalysis of rxte data suggests that in low - mass x - ray binaries there are several candidates for neutron stars with masses between 1.9 and 2.1 @xmath7 ( @xcite ) as , e.g. , 4u 1636 - 536 .",
    "the small number of massive radio pulsars , however , can be a result of selection effects .",
    "cooling curves of nss are strongly dependent on the star mass , the mass spectrum is one of the most important ingredients of the population synthesis of these sources and , unfortunately , one of the less known . still , theoretical considerations @xcite can shed light on the general properties of the mass spectrum of nss .",
    "this properties have to be taken into account when confronting theoretical models of the thermal evolution of nss with observational data .    in this paper",
    "we discuss three issues : the formation of low - mass nss , the mass growth of nss in binaries , and the role of ns masses in the population synthesis of young cooling objects .",
    "the results presented in this section are based on the research note @xcite .    in many models of thermal evolution of compact objects ( neutron stars ",
    "ns , hybrid stars ",
    "hys , strange stars ,  ss ) low - mass sources with @xmath8 remain hot for a relatively long time ( about few million years ) . , also are relatively hot @xcite . ] during all that time they remain hotter than more massive stars ( @xcite and references therein ) . in that sense",
    "they are promising candidates to be observed as _ coolers _ , and their detection is of great interest for the physics of dense matter @xcite . however , in most of models of ns formation @xcite no objects with @xmath9    1.2  @xmath2 are formed .",
    "it is likely that just because masses of stellar cores are always heavier than 1.2  @xmath2 even for the solar metallicity ( and heavier for lower metallicity , see @xcite ) . in our opinion the only way to form a low - mass object from a ( relatively ) high - mass core is fragmentation ( see however a discussion in @xcite , where the author discusses the formation of low - mass sss from white dwarfs via accretion induced collapse ) .    the fragmentation of a rapidly rotating proto - ns due to dynamical instabilities as part of a two - stage supernova ( sn ) explosion mechanism was suggested by @xcite , later the mechanism was developed by @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can explain several particular features of sn explosions ( for example the delay in the neutrino signal from sn1987a ) . in this scenario",
    "a compact object inevitably obtains a high kick velocity .",
    "recently , the mechanism was studied in some details by @xcite in application to kick phenomenon .",
    "because of high temperature the exploding ( lighter ) companion can be significantly more massive than the minimum mass for cold stars ( @xmath10 ) , up to @xmath11 . in that case from the initial object of , say , 1.2    1.3 solar masses due to fragmentation and explosion of the lighter part , we can finally obtain a high - velocity ns with a mass of about 0.8 - 1  @xmath2 or lower if the mass of the initial object was smaller .",
    "even lower masses can appear if in the fragmentation three bodies are formed .",
    "in such a case the lightest or an intermediate mass fragment can be dynamically ejected from the system ( again with significant velocity about thousands km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "such ejected compact objects can have masses about 0.20.5 solar masses . in the remaining pair the lighter",
    "one can start to accrete onto the second companion because of the orbit shrinking due to gravitational waves emission , and after reaching the minimum mass ( @xmath10 ) it explodes .",
    "so , the remaining compact object would also have relatively low mass ( @xmath13 ) and high velocity .",
    "objects formed after fragmentation have particular predictable properties : high spatial velocity , high surface temperature , velocity vector nearly perpendicular to the spin axis ( since in this mechanism the kick is always obtained in the orbital plane which coincides with the equator of the initial proto - ns ) .",
    "due to high kicks low - mass compact objects are not expected to appear in binaries ( at least they should be rarely found in binary systems ) . to find a low - mass compact object one has to search for a hot , young , high velocity ns .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that mass and kick velocity are anti - correlated , as far as a higher mass of the remaining object corresponds to the lighter exploded component , which means to a wider orbit , and to lower orbital velocity of the remaining more massive component .",
    "also higher kicks lead to smaller fall - back ( colpi , wasserman 2002 ) .    to reach fragmentation conditions ( the dynamical instability )",
    "it is necessary that the progenitor core is rapidly rotating .",
    "rotation of isolated progenitors and its influence on properties of newborn nss was studied in several papers ( see , for example , heger et al . 2003 and references therein ) . to obtain a rapidly rotating compact object",
    "it is necessary to avoid spin - down influence of the magnetic field , so probably compact objects born after fragmentation should be low magnetized .",
    "it means that low - mass neutron stars are not expected to be normal radio pulsars . because of the same reason they are not expected to show any kind of magnetar activity",
    "we have to note , that the mechanism of sn explosion suggested by @xcite and @xcite has its internal problems .",
    "there is the possibility , that a rapidly rotating proto - ns can just loose part of its mass in the form of an outflow in the equatorial plane . in that case",
    "two spiral arms appear , no second ( or third ) component is formed , and the kick can be relatively small .",
    "the fraction of lost mass is very small , about 4% ( houser et al .",
    "1994 ) , so that the final mass can not be much lower than the initial one .",
    "if the fragmentation in the process of ns formation never happens in nature , then , in our opinion , it is very improbable , that low - mass compact objects can exist .",
    "the discovery of a high velocity low - mass ns , hys or ss will be a strong argument in favour of the mechanism .    to conclude : the fragmentation of a proto - ns can be a unique mechanism of the formation of low - mass compact objects , which are expected to have several peculiar characteristics that can help to distinguish them among possible candidates .",
    "however , the realization of this mechanism in nature is not very promising .",
    "in this section we present our recent calculations of the mass growth of nss in close binary systems @xcite .",
    "observationally , high masses of nss are mainly supported by data on x - ray binaries , where recently new results have been extracted from a reanalysis of rxte data which has suggested that sharp and reproduceable changes in qpo properties are related to the innermost stable circular orbit . a mass estimate of 1.9 - 2.1  @xmath2 has been given for 4u 1636 - 536 ( @xcite ) .",
    "estimates for several systems give also very high mass values with rather large uncertainties : 1.82.4  @xmath2 for vela x-1 and @xmath14 . ]",
    "( @xcite ) , 2.4@xmath15  @xmath2 for 4u 1700 - 37 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite presented observations of a low - mass x - ray binary 2s",
    "0921 - 630/v395  car for which the 1-@xmath16 mass range for the compact object is 2.04.3  @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of nss with @xmath17@xmath18 is not in contradiction with the present day theory of ns interiors .",
    "there are several models with stiff equation of state which allow the existence of nss with masses larger than @xmath19 ( see a review and references in @xcite and in the contribution of j. lattimer in these proceedings ) . here",
    "we will assume that masses of nss with extreme rotation can reach the maximum value @xmath20 according to the estimate by @xcite . if , however , in nature @xmath21 is lower than this value , the part of the obtained mass spectrum exceeding it should be attributed to black holes .",
    "the model we use is discussed in detail in @xcite . for our calculations",
    "we use the ` scenario machine' code developed at the sternberg astronomical institute.mystery / articles / review/. ] a description of most of the parameters of the code can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions of the scenario are :    * all nss are born with @xmath3 .",
    "* at the common envelope stage a hypercritical accretion ( with @xmath22 much larger than the eddington value ) is possible . * during accretion the magnetic field of",
    "a ns decays to a value that can not prevent rapid ( maximum ) rotation of the ns . * the oppenheimer - volkoff mass of a rapidly rotating ns ( the critical mass of a bh formation )",
    "is assumed to be 3.45  @xmath2 according to @xcite .    .",
    "the upper mass limit corresponds to skys with maximum rotation ( ouyed 2004 ) .",
    "the dashed line represents results for the scenario with zero kick .",
    "the solid line is the non - zero kick .",
    "left peaks for both distributions correspond to nss with a single episode of accretion .",
    "right peaks are formed by nss which also increased their masses via accretion from wds .",
    "distributions were normalized to unity , ie .",
    "the area below each line is equal to one . ]      as we are interested here in systems with a high mass ratio it is necessary to consider three different situations after ns formation when the secondary fills its roche lobe : _",
    "i. ) _ a normal star can fill its roche lobe without common envelope formation ; _ ii . )",
    "_ a normal star can fill its roche lobe with common envelope formation ; _ iii . ) _ a wd fills its roche lobe .    to fill the roche lobe a normal secondary star has to evolve further than the main sequence stage . during its evolution prior to the roche lobe overflow the mass of the star is nearly constant .",
    "a common envelope is not formed if the normal star is not significantly heavier than the ns . in this regime , mass is not lost from the binary system . for more massive secondaries ,",
    "formation of a common envelope is inevitable , mass transfer is unstable .",
    "in this regime , a significant fraction of the mass flow is lost from the system , so the mass of the ns grows less effectively . after the common envelope stage",
    "the orbital separation becomes smaller , so later on even a degenerate core of the secondary  a wd  can fill the roche lobe .    in the figure we present our calculations of the mass spectrum of massive nss .",
    "about 25% of accreting massive nss have normal stars as secondaries , the rest have wd companions .",
    "the formation rate of massive nss was found to be @xmath23  yrs@xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath24 of these compact stars in the galaxy .",
    "the discussion below is related to our recent study of criteria to test theoretical cooling curves @xcite based on an approach for hybrid stars with color superconducting quark matter cores @xcite .",
    "cooling curves of ns are strongly mass dependent ( see contributions by d. page , a. kaminker and others in this volume ) . unfortunately , a mass determination with high precision is available only for nss in binary systems .",
    "compact objects in x - ray binaries could accrete a significant amount of matter .",
    "for some of the radio pulsars observed in binaries , accretion also played an important rle . without any doubts masses of millisecond pulsars",
    "do not represent their initial values .",
    "however , there is a small number of nss with well determined masses , for which it is highly possible that these masses did not change significantly since these nss were born ( data on ns masses can be found , for example , in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these are secondary ( younger ) components of double ns systems . according to standard evolutionary scenarios",
    "these compact objects never accreted a significant amount of mass .",
    "their masses lie in the narrow range 1.18  -  1.39  @xmath2 .",
    "now there are nine double - ns systems with well - estimated masses of the secondary components .",
    "this set of data is a very good evidence in favour of the mass spectrum used in our population synthesis calculations @xcite . of course",
    ", some effects of binary evolution can be important , and so for isolated stars ( or stars in very wide binaries ) the situation can be slightly different .",
    "however , with these observational estimates of initial masses of nss we feel more confident using the spectrum with a small number of nss with @xmath25  -  @xmath26 .",
    "brighter sources are easier to discover .",
    "so , among known cooling nss the fraction of nss with _ typical _ masses , i.e. in the range @xmath27 , should be even higher than in the original mass spectrum .",
    "so , we have the impression that it is necessary to try to explain even cold ( may be with an exception of 1 - 2 coldest ) sources with @xmath28  -  @xmath26 .",
    "especially , the magnificent seven and other young close - by compact objects should be explained as most typical representatives of the whole ns population .",
    "we want to underline that , even being selected by their observability in soft x - rays , these sources form one of the most uniform samples of young isolated nss . in this sense",
    ", the situation where a significant number of sources are explained by cooling curves corresponding to @xmath29 should be considered as a disadvantage of the model .",
    "particularly , vela , geminga and rx j1856 - 3754 should not be explained as massive nss .",
    "all the above gives us the opportunity to formulate the conjecture of a _ mass spectrum constraint _ : data points should be explained mostly by nss with _ typical _ masses .",
    "sbp wants to thank the organizers for support and hospitality .",
