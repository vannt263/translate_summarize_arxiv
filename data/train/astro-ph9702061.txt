    "there are the general theorems about the gravitational lensing(@xcite ; @xcite ) which mainly state the relationships between the numbers of the images with different parities ; @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of images of type i. we use @xmath2 and @xmath3 analogously .",
    "the types of images are defined by the jacobian matrix of the fermat s potential @xmath4 , @xmath5    type i : :    : both eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix are positive .",
    "type ii : :    : one eigenvalue is positive and another negative .",
    "type iii : :    : both are negative .    therefore type i and type iii images have positive parities and type ii images have negative ones .",
    "the existing general theorems are general for transparent and non - singular lens models .",
    "typical examples are the elliptical lens models with softened power law behavior(@xcite ; schneider , et al .",
    "however , they do not exhaust all the lens models .",
    "they are rather phenomenological models , whereas there is a widely valid model .",
    "it is multipole expansion model(mpe model ) which is obtained by expanding deflection potential with respect to impact parameter(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is less popular than the former in lensing analysis but is very powerful ( fukuyama , et al .",
    "the mpe model is nontransparent and singular , and we see how the general theorems are extended to incorporate mpe model and other models . in this extension",
    "we propose the generalized index theorem valid also to the nontransparent and singular lens model and the formulation in complex coordinates is found to be very convenient .",
    "before proceeding to the concrete physical situation , let us begin with the mathematical preparations .",
    "index theorem for critical points in two dimensional flat or closed curved surfaces is well known for mathematicians ( @xcite ) . they are summarized as follows : we consider the vector field on the surface @xmath6 . denoting the critical points ( at which the vector field vanishes ) by @xmath7 on @xmath6 , we get the following theorem .",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the euler characteristic of @xmath6 . for flat space @xmath10 is one and the result becomes equation ( [ index ] ) .",
    "this theorem does not hold in the case that the vector field has singular points .",
    "so we reformulate the index theorem so as to incorporate pole terms .",
    "let us consider a complex function @xmath11 with a complex variable @xmath12 that is not necessarily holomorphic .",
    "the function @xmath13 plays the role of the vector field mentioned above .",
    "the index of @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 this measures the variation of the phase of @xmath13 along the closed curve @xmath15 which goes anti - clockwise .",
    "when @xmath15 does not enclose any zero points or poles , the index vanishes .",
    "if @xmath15 encloses some zero points or poles , @xmath16 , then the index is given by the summation of the contributions from each point @xmath7 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the circle enclosing the point @xmath7 . in the context of the gravitational lenses , @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath19(@xmath20 ; @xmath21 is complex conjugate of @xmath12 ) and @xmath22 is just lens equation ( see eqs.[[fingl ] ] and [ [ fermat ] ] )",
    ". therefore ordinary images are zero points of order one .",
    "if lens object has finite total mass and extended regular mass density , then we have the pole only at infinity .",
    "whereas in the case of mpe models and models with singular mass density such as point masses , other poles are produced .    from the form of equation ( [ indsum ] ) we should pay attention to each contribution .",
    "let us consider the map @xmath23 in the neighborhood of @xmath7 .",
    "then the @xmath24 is rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the value of the right hand side is the ( algebraic ) number of times that we wind around @xmath27 when we go around @xmath18 in the anti - clockwise direction .",
    "firstly we consider zero point case and proceed to the case of poles .",
    "hereafter we set the origin of complex @xmath12-plane at the zero point @xmath7 and we use bold - face letters for the value of any function @xmath28 , for example , @xmath29 .",
    "in the neighborhood of a zero point , @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 where lower indices @xmath12 and @xmath21 mean partial derivatives with respect to them , for example , @xmath32    we define @xmath33 by @xmath34 then the jacobian @xmath35 of the mapping from @xmath12 to @xmath30 is in this case given by @xmath36 that is , @xmath37 reserve ( reverse ) the direction of rotation if @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "winding number of @xmath27 is one for the point of order one and @xmath40      about a zero point , @xmath30 is expanded as a polynomial of @xmath12 and @xmath21 .",
    "however the winding number is determined by the lowest power term as is easily checked .    for the simplicity",
    ", we consider the case that dominant part in the neighborhood of the zero point consists of the only term as @xmath41 we call this type of zero point as @xmath42-type critical point for later use .",
    "although equation ( [ power ] ) restricts the form of @xmath13 , as we see later , for the case of point masses and mpe models , it is enough to examine equation ( [ power ] ) .",
    "then the index of @xmath13 is given by @xmath43 therefore , from the previous subsection [ orderone ] , we can regard zero points with @xmath44 as @xmath45-type and ones with @xmath46 as @xmath47-type .",
    "as was mentioned , besides the zero points , pole terms of @xmath13 also contribute to @xmath48 . in the neighborhood of pole of @xmath13 we define @xmath28 by @xmath49 , then @xmath50 comes from the definition of equation ( [ def ] ) .",
    "if @xmath13 consists of several pole terms , @xmath48 is determined by the highest pole term .",
    "thus , similarly to the case of zero points , we can regard the pole whose dominant term has the form of equation ( [ power ] ) as @xmath42-type critical point with negative integers @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we have completed mathematical preparations and proceed to application to gravitational lensing . in this case",
    "@xmath13 is defined through the fermat s potential @xmath4 by @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 are image ( source ) positions in the complex notations and @xmath56 is the deflection potential defined by @xmath57 where the integral measure @xmath58 means @xmath59 and @xmath60 is normalized surface mass density of lens object .",
    "we assume @xmath61 and this condition may hold for the models with finite total mass .    for the large impact parameter ,",
    "@xmath19 becomes @xmath62 that is , infinite point becomes pole .",
    "remarking that the anti - clockwise loop @xmath15 ( @xmath63 ) is viewed as clockwise one from the infinite point , we obtain the contribution of the infinite point to the index as @xmath64 diminishing the radius of the circle @xmath15 , it is entangled with the zero points and poles . then equation ( [ fermat ] ) must be equal to the sum of these contributions .    as we have mentioned , the zero point of order one in the neighborhood of the origin is classified into @xmath45-type for @xmath65 and @xmath47-type for @xmath66 by the contribution to the index .",
    "thus , we can say that the contribution comes from the term @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant and positive ( negative ) @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the zero points ( poles ) .",
    "we denote the number of @xmath42-type critical points as @xmath69 .",
    "then from the arguments of the section [ formulation ] , we get @xmath70",
    "lastly , we give the concrete example of the theorem in the multiple images of pg1115 + 080(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows critical and caustics lines of the fermat s potential and image positions numerically fitted by a model with softened power law surface density ( @xcite ) .",
    "critical lines are those on which jacobian determinant equation ( [ jacobian ] ) vanishes .",
    "so the parities of images are reversed across a critical line .",
    "images outside the outermost critical line have positive parities .",
    "hence critical lines are useful for determination of parities of images .    from positions of the critical lines , we can know that @xmath82 and @xmath83 belong to @xmath1 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 do to @xmath2 and @xmath86 to @xmath3 .",
    "so the calculated numbers of images satisfy the original theorem equation ( [ index ] ) .    on the other hand fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows fitting of the same lens system by a mpe model including up to quadrupole ( fukuyama , et al .",
    "1997 ) . @xmath84 and @xmath85 belong to @xmath1 .",
    "the other @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath35 and @xmath87 do to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , these satisfy equation ( [ new ] ) for the case of quadrupole , @xmath88 .",
