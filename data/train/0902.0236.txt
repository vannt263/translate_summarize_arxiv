    "tay  @xcite and whiteley  @xcite independently proved that the generic infinitesimal rigidity of a body - and - hinge framework is determined by the underlying ( multi)graph as follows .",

    "a body - and - hinge framework @xmath30 is called _ hinge - coplanar _ if , for each @xmath16 , all of the @xmath7-dimensional affine subspaces @xmath32 for the edges @xmath33 incident to @xmath20 are contained in a common @xmath34-dimensional affine subspace ( i.e.  a hyperplane ) . in this case",

    "( see figure  [ fig : body - and - hinge](c ) ) .",
    "note that `` hinge - coplanarity '' implies a special hinge configuration of a body - and - hinge framework , which may cause a degree of freedom even if the underlying graph satisfies the tree packing condition of proposition  [ prop : tay ] . in 1984 ,",
    "tay and whiteley  @xcite jointly conjectured that such an extra degree of freedom does not appear .",
    "@xmath35 [ conjecture ] let @xmath11 be a multigraph .",
    "then , @xmath1 can be realized as an infinitesimally rigid body - and - hinge framework in @xmath9 if and only if @xmath1 can be realized as an infinitesimally rigid panel - and - hinge framework in @xmath9 .",
    "conjecture  [ conjecture ] is known as the _ molecular conjecture _ which has appeared in several different forms  @xcite and has been a long standing open problem in the rigidity theory .",
    "for the special case of @xmath36 , whiteley  @xcite proved the conjecture affirmatively for the special class of multigraphs in 1989 and recently the conjecture has been completely proved by jackson and jordn  @xcite .",
    "the idea of their proof is to replace each body of a panel - and - hinge framework by a rigid bar - and - joint framework ( called a rigid component ) and reduce the problem to that for bar - and - joint frameworks .",
    "the definition of a bar - and - joint framework can be found in e.g.  @xcite . by using well - investigated properties of @xmath6-dimensional bar - and - joint frameworks",
    ", they successfully proved the conjecture .",
    "also , jackson and jord ' an  @xcite showed the _ sufficient _ condition of the graph to have a panel - and - hinge realization in higher dimension ; @xmath1 has a panel - and - hinge realization in @xmath9 if @xmath37 has @xmath0 edge - disjoint spanning trees .",
    "this sufficient condition has been proved by replacing each hinge of a body - and - hinge framework by rigid bars connecting the bodies .    in this paper",
    "we will settle the molecular conjecture affirmatively in general dimension .",
    "although the overall strategy of our proof is slightly close to that of @xcite for 2-dimension , our proof directly provides a construction of an infinitesimally rigid panel - and - hinge framework , which is a main ( and huge ) difference from @xcite .    in @xmath31",
    "the rigidity of panel - and - hinge frameworks has a special connection with the flexibility of molecules .",
    "to identify flexible / rigid region in a protein is one of the central issues in the field of molecular biology as this could provide insight into its function and a means to predict possible changes of structural flexibility by the environmental factors such as temperature and ph .",
    "one of standard methods is to model the protein as a body - and - hinge or a bar - and - joint framework and it analyzes the protein s rigidity by using the theory of structural rigidity .    consider a molecule consisting of atoms connected by covalent bonds .",
    "it is known that a molecule can be modeled as a bar - and - joint framework of the _ square _ of a graph ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the square of a graph @xmath11 is defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "this framework can be also seen as a body - and - hinge framework by regarding each atom ( vertex ) as a rigid body and each bond ( edge ) as a hinge since in the square of a graph a vertex and its neighbor always form a complete graph .",
    "notice however that this body - and - hinge framework has a `` special '' hinge configuration , i.e. , all the hinges ( lines ) incident to a body are intersecting each other at the center of the body .",
    "such a hinge configuration is called _ hinge - concurrent _ , and so a molecule can be modeled as a hinge - concurrent body - and - hinge framework  @xcite .",
    "the projective duality reveals the reason why conjecture  [ conjecture ] is called the `` molecular conjecture '' .",
    "recall that taking projective dual in @xmath31 transforms points to planes , lines to lines and planes to points preserving their incidences .",
    "this means that the dual of a hinge - concurrent body - and - hinge framework is exactly a panel - and - hinge framework .",
    "crapo and whiteley  @xcite showed that the infinitesimal rigidity is invariant under the projective duality , which implies that @xmath1 has an infinitesimally rigid panel - and - hinge realization if and only if it has an infinitesimally rigid hinge - concurrent body - and - hinge realization .",
    "therefore , the correctness of the molecular conjecture suggests that the flexibility of proteins can be combinatorially investigated by using the well - developed tree - algorithm on the underlying graphs .",
    "in fact , the so - called `` pebble game '' algorithm  @xcite for packing spanning trees is implemented in several softwares , e.g. , first  @xcite , rock  @xcite and others  @xcite . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", however , the correctness proof is incomplete because they rely on the molecular conjecture which has been a long standing open problem over twenty - five years .",
    "the result of this paper provides the theoretical validity of the algorithms behind such softwares as first , rock , etc .",
    "the paper consists of seven sections . in section  2",
    ", we shall provide a formal definition of the infinitesimal rigidity of body - and - hinge frameworks following the description given in @xcite . in section  [ sec : spanning_trees ]",
    ", we will provide several preliminary results concerning edge - disjoint spanning trees . in sections",
    "[ sec : body - and - hinge rigid graph ] and [ sec : inductive ] , we will investigate the combinatorial properties of multigraphs @xmath1 such that @xmath26 contains @xmath22 edge - disjoint spanning trees .",
    "such graphs are called _ body - and - hinge rigid graphs_. in particular , edge - inclusionwise minimal body - and - hinge rigid graphs are called _ minimally body - and - hinge rigid graphs_. in section  5 , we will show that any minimally body - and - hinge rigid graph can be reduced to a smaller minimally body - and - hinge rigid graph by the contraction of a rigid subgraph or a splitting off operation ( defined in section  5 ) at a vertex of degree two .",
    "this implies that any minimally body - and - hinge rigid graph can be constructed from a smaller body - and - hinge rigid graph by the inversions of these two operations . finally , in sections  6 and 7 , we will provide a proof of the molecular conjecture by showing that any minimally body - and - hinge rigid graph @xmath1 has a rigid panel - and - hinge realization . the proof is done by induction on the graph size .",
    "more precisely , following the construction of a graph given in section  5 , we convert @xmath1 to a smaller minimally body - and - hinge rigid graph @xmath40 . from the induction hypothesis",
    "there exists a rigid panel - and - hinge realization of @xmath40",
    ". we will show that we can extend this realization to that of @xmath1 with a slight modification so that the resulting framework becomes rigid .",
    "in this section we shall provide a formal definition of body - and - hinge frameworks following the description given in @xcite .",
    "refer to @xcite for more detailed descriptions . throughout the paper",
    ", we simply refer to a @xmath0-dimensional affine space as a @xmath0-affine space for any nonnegative integer @xmath0 .",
    "a _ body _ is a set of points which affinely spans @xmath9",
    ". an _ infinitesimal motion _ of a body is an isometric linear transformation of the body , i.e. ,  the distance between any two points in the body is preserved after the transformation .",
    "it is known that the set of infinitesimal motions of a body forms a @xmath22-dimensional vector space , i.e. , an infinitesimal motion is a linear combination of @xmath0 translations and @xmath41 rotations around @xmath7-affine subspaces .",
    "for example , when @xmath36 and @xmath42 , a typical basis of the vector space of infinitesimal motions is the set of three infinitesimal motions consisting of two translations parallel to each axis and one rotation around the origin .",
    "these infinitesimal motions are elegantly modeled by using vectors of length @xmath22 , called _ screw centers _",
    ", described below .",
    "it is known that rigidity properties are projectively invariant  @xcite and hence it is useful to work with the @xmath0-dimensional projective space .",
    "to do so , for any point @xmath43 , we will assign the homogeneous coordinate @xmath44 , denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be a @xmath47-affine subspace of @xmath9 determined by the points @xmath48 .",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the @xmath50-matrix whose @xmath51-th row is @xmath45 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the _ plcker coordinate _",
    "@xmath53 of @xmath46 is defined as the @xmath54 times the determinant of the @xmath55-submatrix obtained from @xmath49 by deleting @xmath56-th columns for all @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the _ plcker coordinate vector _ of @xmath46 is defined as the @xmath59-dimensional vector obtained by writing down all of possible plcker coordinates of @xmath46 in some predetermined order , say , the lexicographic order of the indices ( see e.g.  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "grassmann - cayley algebra ( see e.g.  @xcite ) treats a plcker coordinate vector at a symbolic level , that is , no coordinate basis is specified , and the symbolic version of a plcker coordinate vector is referred to as a _ @xmath23-extensor _ , which is denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "although we will work on the coordinatized version , we would like to exploit this terminology to follow the conventional notation .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then , the _ join _ of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is defined as @xmath65 , that is , a @xmath66-dimensional vector consisting of @xmath67-minors of @xmath68 if @xmath69 and otherwise @xmath70 .",
    "it is known that @xmath71 if and only if @xmath72 is linearly independent and equivalently @xmath73 is affinely independent .",
    "also , let us formally state the following property since it will be used later .",
    "[ lemma : extensor ] let @xmath74 be a set of @xmath75 points in @xmath9 which is affinely independent . then",
    ", the set of @xmath34-extensors @xmath76 is linearly independent .",
    "although this fact is implicitly used several times in e.g.  @xcite , let us show a proof for the completeness .",
    "suppose that it is dependent . then , there exist scalars @xmath77 for all @xmath78 indices , indicating the dependence , @xmath79 and at least one scalar must be nonzero . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath80 . then , taking the join of ( [ eq : extensor_dependence ] ) with @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath63 is affinely independent , we also have @xmath83 .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath84 , which is a contradiction .",
    "let us review how to describe an infinitesimal rotation of a body around a @xmath7-affine subspace @xmath85 in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath86 be @xmath87 points in @xmath9 which affinely span @xmath85 .",
    "then , @xmath88 is called a @xmath34-extensor associated with @xmath85 .",
    "note that the 1-dimensional vector space spanned by @xmath89 is determined independently of the choice of @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath90 be a point in the body , and let us consider @xmath91 , which is a @xmath0-extensor associated with the @xmath34-affine subspace @xmath92 spanned by @xmath93 .",
    "then , @xmath91 is a @xmath94-dimensional vector and it is not difficult to see that the first @xmath0 coordinates represent a vector normal to @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , letting @xmath95 be an arbitrary point in @xmath92 , @xmath96 represents the equation expressing the hyperplane @xmath92 , and the coefficient of @xmath97 in this equation is equal to the @xmath51-th coordinate of @xmath91 .",
    "more precisely , for some normal vector @xmath98 to @xmath92 , @xmath91 can be expressed by @xmath99 , where @xmath100 means a dot product .",
    "it is also known that the length of @xmath98 is proportional to the distance between @xmath85 and @xmath101 ( and to the volume of the simplex determined by @xmath102 ) .",
    "this implies that , for some constant scalar @xmath103 , the first @xmath0 entries of @xmath104 represents the velocity vector of the rotation around @xmath85 at @xmath101 ( and @xmath103 can be regarded as the angular velocity ) .",

    "we may henceforth refer to the @xmath22-dimensional vector @xmath116 as the _ center _ of the translation to the direction @xmath108 .",
    "recall that a motion of a body is a linear combination of rotations and translations .",
    "let @xmath117 be the centers corresponding to these rotations and translations .",
    "then , the infinitesimal motion at a point @xmath101 in the body is the first @xmath0 coordinates of @xmath118 .",
    "hence , we call the @xmath22-dimensional vector @xmath119 the _ screw center _ of the infinitesimal motion .",
    "we note that a screw center can not be represented as a @xmath34-extensor in general , but a set of all @xmath34-extensors spans the @xmath22-dimensional vector space by lemma  [ lemma : extensor ] .",
