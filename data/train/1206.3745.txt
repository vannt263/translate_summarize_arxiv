    "first , we take into consideration the inefficiency of detectors , which can be modeled by placing an imaginary beamsplitter in front of each detector and varying its transmittance , say @xmath137 . for a perfect ( totally inefficient ) detector , @xmath141 for a low success probability",

    "however , despite the rapid drop of the probability , the fidelity is very robust against the detector efficiency and still remains high .",
    "moreover , this robustness of the fidelity can also be demonstrated together with the mean photon number . with the experimental report of ref .",

    "even when @xmath137 is lowered to as small as 0.1 , the fidelities are still higher than 59% reported in @xcite , with mean value slightly higher than @xmath145 .",
