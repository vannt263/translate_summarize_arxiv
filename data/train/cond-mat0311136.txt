    "currently a large number of model approaches are present for formulating the decoherence phenomena in the literature .",
    "the original caldeira - leggett model@xcite is based on a quantum system under the influence of a double well tunneling potential with a linear coupling to an infinite bath of harmonic oscillators . if the potential is _ sufficiently _ smooth and the high energy levels are sufficiently above the tunneling barrier this original model is normally represented as a two level system@xcite ( 2ls ) interacting with a bosonic environmental bath ( spin - boson model ) .",
    "an incomplete list of this wide literature is provided in @xcite .",
    "another popular model of decoherence is the central spin system in which central 2ls couples to large number of environmental two level systems .",
    "the pros and cons of these two rival models have been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "realistically , and aside from the genuine 2ls , a large majority of physical systems suggested for qubit is far from being ideal . in a quantum computational environment ,",
    "the parameters of the physical systems are manipulated to perform the gate operations .",
    "for instance , in a multilevel system ( mls ) , short time pulses used in the manipulation of the states in the qubit subspace induce nonresonant transitions out of the qubit subspace . that nonresonant transitions contribute to the decoherence of the quantum system",
    "was recently addressed by tian and lloyd@xcite .",
    "they suggest that after these transitions are induced an optimized sequence of controlled pulses can be applied to cancel the nonresonant effects at arbitrary precision .",
    "the idea being physically correct , requires an additional fine knitting of error correction which undoubtedly costs computational time . on the other hand",
    ", one may address the same issue by seeking for an alternative solution : can one understand the effect of the higher levels on decoherence in a well - parameterized mls coupled to an environment ?    the mls can itself be manifestly @xmath1-levelled or a truncated approximation of a larger system with much higher number of levels .",
    "well known examples of both cases have been known . for the former , organic molecules with certain discrete rotational symmetries and ground state low temperature configurations of single polimerized chains are good examples .",
    "the vibrational energy spectra of atoms and molecules is a good example for the latter .",
    "these type of realistic mls can be found for instance in already well - examined superconducting systems such as the rf - squid in the charge , flux or phase regimes .",
    "we remark however , that a concise treatment of the decoherence effects in mls has not been fully developed .",
    "this work is planned to be a modest step forward in that direction .    in section",
    "ii we give an introduction of the model mls used in the present work . here",
    "we merely concentrate on the properties of the environmentally induced _ dipole",
    "_ matrix elements .",
    "section iii recalls the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) master equation formalism and adapts it for the coupling of the mls to the environment .",
    "the noise correlator , which is considered to be in thermal equilibrium , and the system - noise kernel , for which no markovian assumption is made , are defined in section iii.a .",
    "the results are presented together with the earlier observations of the 2ls ( in section iii.b ) to allow a comparison with some of the established facts .",
    "the mls with three or higher levels are examined in section iii.c separately for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the section iii.c and the following section iv comprise most of the original results of the manuscript . in section iv , the relaxation times for mls , which we produced numerically in section iii , are compared with the estimates found by using the semianalytic fermi golden rule ( fgr ) .",
    "in principle the majority of the well established methods ( particularly the influence functional ) used in the literature automatically accomodate multilevel dynamics .",
    "the results are generally hoped to be true for 2ls in the wkb limit at sufficiently low temperatures@xcite .",
    "such techniques are also often preferable since they allow explicit analytic expressions for the decoherence times as functions of the system s parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "exact methods are also available on pure 2ls@xcite .",
    "however , we need to accomodate in our parameters explicit degeneracy factors as well as the hilbert space dimensions . for the latter , the influence functional formalism has no parametric dependence . in this work , in order to retain in our calculations the dependence on the system s hilbert space dimension , we resort to the system s eigenenergy basis representation .",
    "our mls model is an rf - squid operating in the quantum coherence regime given by the hamiltonian @xmath8 + \\beta\\,\\cos(\\gamma\\,z ) \\label{squid.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the harmonic energy with @xmath10 being the inductance of the squid loop and @xmath11 is the effective capacitance of the josephson junction , @xmath12 is the dimensionless ratio of the josephson energy @xmath13 to the harmonic energy , @xmath14 is a dimensionless scale parameter , @xmath15 is the effective bias in the flux which is applicable in a current bias junction , and @xmath16 is the flux ( @xmath17 ) dependent dimensionless dynamical variable ( @xmath18 is the superconducting flux quantum ) .",
    "truncating the hilbert space dimension at @xmath1 in the energy eigenbasis , the system hamiltonian in ( [ squid.1 ] ) is written in the diagonal form @xmath19 where @xmath20 describes the set of system parameters @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are respectively the parameter dependent eigenenergies and eigenvectors of the mls .",
    "this set of parameters is sufficiently general to accomodate for all possible effects including the degeneracy in the qubit subspace , the symmetry of the wavefunctions etc .",
    "[ we define the degeneracy factor by @xmath24 for mls and @xmath25 for 2ls ] .",
    "these three parameters @xmath26 control the high energy harmonic spectrum , the low energy anharmonic spectrum and the reflection symmetry of the rf - squid potential respectively . at low energies ,",
    "a simple numerical diagonalization ( [ squid.1 ] ) reveals that there are low lying eigenenergy configurations within the double well regime in which the squid potential is strongly anharmonic .",
    "the parameters of the potential can therefore be manipulated to search within this regime for those configurations satisfying optimal qubit conditions .",
    "an interesting case here is to find highly degenerate@xcite levels corresponding to the first two eigenstates for the symmetric double well potential ( i.e. @xmath27 ) .",
    "this particular case has been extensively examined previously for 2ls using semiclassical methods with an arbitrarily weak tunneling between the wells@xcite .",
    "another configuration that turns out to be important in our calculations is the doubly degenerate ( dd ) configuration for systems with @xmath4 in which the first four levels are pairwise degenerate with large degeneracy factors .",
    "the double - well potential and energies corresponding to both sd and dd configurations are shown in figs([pot1 ] ) and ( [ pot2 ] ) respectively .     and @xmath28 . the harmonic energy scale and the degeneracy factors are respectively @xmath29 and @xmath30 . here",
    "the numerical values of the dimensionless parameters are @xmath31 and @xmath28 . ]     and",
    "the harmonic energy scale and the degeneracy factors are is @xmath33 ev , @xmath34 . ]",
    "we numerically find that , the relaxation / dephasing ( rd ) times for the mls can be controlled by the degeneracy @xmath35 . normally , degeneracy is also crucial in controlling the dynamical tunneling rates . in our calculations",
    "however we directly use the system eigenstates .",
    "therefore for the highly degenerate configurations bare tunneling between symmetric and anti - symmetric parts of the wavefunctions can be neglected to a large extend .",
    "this turns out to be especially important for quantum computation in the sense that once the computation is finished the wavefunction can be maximally localized in one of the double wells before any measurement or read - out process .",
    "although we use the truncated rf - squid as the n - level model quantum system to study decoherence effects , our treatment is not at the microscopic level .",
    "the rf - squid is shown to be an ideal model to study multilevel effects due to the fact that , the transitional dipole couplings between the low lying energy states and the high levels are nonnegligible [ see fig.([dipole.1 ] ) ] .",
    "any other physical hamiltonian with sufficient number of adjustable parameters as well as nonnegligible dipole couplings would be suitable for the calculations presented here .    in the rest of the paper",
    "the harmonic energy @xmath36 is a free parameter which is used for scaling energy and time .",
    "the system - noise interaction is considered to be a caldeira - leggett type _ inductive _ coupling between the squid s macroscopic flux coordinate @xmath37 and the environmental _",
    "flux_-like coordinate @xmath38 expanded in harmonic environmental modes as @xmath39 .",
    "the system noise interaction is simply @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some number representing the strength of the inductive coupling ( @xmath41 is to be normalized by @xmath42 for a dimensionless coupling ) . in the diagonal basis @xmath43 of the model system",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath44 here @xmath45 are the noise induced perturbative _ dipole _",
    "matrix elements of the macroscopic system coordinate @xmath37 in the mls s diagonal basis in ( [ mss.1 ] ) . for the model mls described by ( [ squid.1 ] ) , the dipole matrix elements are real and symmetric .",
    "the rf - squid poses a general example in which the multilevelledness of the master system manifests itself by finite dipole transition matrix elements for both the symmetric ( i.e. @xmath27 ) and asymmetric ( i.e. @xmath46 ) potential configurations . in the symmetric contribution",
    "even parity transitions vanish which results in manifestly off - diagonal system - noise coupling . physically , this is in contrast to the most popular models used in the literature . on the other hand , when the potential is tilted , the parity selection no more holds by which finite diagonal couplings are also created .     of the coupling of the rf - squid to a flux noise versus the truncated hilbert space dimension [ calculated in the eigenenergy basis of ( [ squid.1 ] ) ] ]    in fig.[dipole.1 ] the noise induced couplings for an asymmetric potential is plotted as a function of the truncated hilbert space dimension .",
    "data indicate that the induced dipole strengths between the qubit and the higher energy states are comparable to those among the qubit states . therefore , the high energy transitions can not be trivially ignored .",
    "the high energy transitions normally appear as a result of resonant interactions with the high energy sector of the noise spectrum under long interaction times .",
    "however , in the reduced system these transitions appear in the short time dynamics as well , and the short time dynamics is dominated by the nonresonant processes . considering that decoherence",
    "is dominantly affected by the short time behaviour , the nonresonant processes are expected to have observable effects in the decoherence properties of the rdm .",
    "indeed we observe these effects in the solution of the master equation for the mls ( section iii.b and c ) .",
    "the next is to consider the environmental spectrum and the availability of the bath frequencies for these excitations . regarding this",
    ", we consider a thermal gaussian environment spectrum @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the effective noise cutoff frequency and @xmath49 describes the subohmic ( i.e. @xmath50 ) , superohmic ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , and ohmic ( i.e. @xmath52 ) character of the spectrum .",
    "the three environmental parameters @xmath53 determine the sectors of the spectrum where the system - noise coupling is most effective . for @xmath54 ( extreme subohmic ) ,",
    "two regions are of particular importance : a ) at sufficiently low temperatures and high cutoff corresponding to @xmath55 , the dominant mechanism of relaxation is through spontaneous deexcitations@xcite .",
    "we call this region _ region_-i ; b ) at high temperatures and high cutoff the region @xmath56 provides a wider range of strong environmental couplings which we call as _ region_-ii .",
    "if the character of the spectrum is more like ohmic or superohmic , i.e. @xmath57 or @xmath58 respectively , there is lesser room for dexcitations as the availability of the low energy modes is suppressed .",
    "therefore , in the ohmic and superohmic regimes , the _ region_-ii dominates the rd phenomena .",
    "another feature of ( [ bath.1 ] ) is related to the majority of critical crossover behaviour in the vicinity of @xmath52 as predicted earlier by leggett et al . and depicted in fig.[spectrum.1 ] .     in ( [ bath.1 ] )",
    "versus @xmath59 and @xmath49 for @xmath60 parameterized by @xmath61 ( from the innermost to the outermost surfaces respectively ) . ]    in this figure , the @xmath62 is a critical vicinity in the ohmic region separating the subohmic @xmath63 regime from that @xmath64 . in the subohmic regime",
    "@xmath65 is very small except for vanishingly small frequencies ( @xmath66 ) . whereas , in the regime @xmath64 the maximum value of @xmath67 is observed at higher frequencies @xmath68 with an intensity proportional to @xmath69",
    "in the study of decoherence effects due to the weak environmental influences , one conventional way is to calculate the time dependent rdm elements by solving the master equation . this formalism has been known since the independent works of bloch , redfield and fano ( brf)@xcite on spin magnetic resonance and widely applied to the spin - boson systems for which many standard references exist@xcite .",
    "the standard brf formalism assumes markov conditions for the solution of the master equations , which leads to exactly solvable results for 2ls@xcite .",
    "however , the markovian assumption is not free of drawbacks and that was questioned originally in @xcite and lately in @xcite as well as @xcite in the context of spin magnetic resonance and relaxation .    in this work ,",

    ", we will give more emphasis on short observational times in the solution of ( [ densmatr.1 ] ) . a convenient way to proceed",
    "is then to apply the born approximation in which the full density matrix is initially a product of the system and environmental ones ( i.e. @xmath72 ) and at any later and short time approximately separates as @xmath73 .    the exact iterative solution of ( [ densmatr.1 ] ) including the second order in the interaction with the partial trace performed over the environmental degrees of freedom yields for the rdm the integro - differential equation @xmath74 in which we adopt the model interaction hamiltonian ( [ sysnoise.1 ] ) for the system - noise kernel which is found to be @xmath75 \\\\   & & + { \\cal f}^*(t - t^\\prime ) [ ( \\hat{\\tilde{z}}_{t^\\prime}\\hat{\\tilde{z}}_{t})_{m\\,s } \\delta_{r , n}-(\\hat{\\tilde{z}}_{t})_{n\\,r } ( \\hat{\\tilde{z}}_{t^\\prime})_{s\\,m}]\\bigr\\ } \\end{array } \\label{densmatr.3}\\ ] ] note the the kernel depends on two times as a signature of the non markovian treatment and it is not time translationally invariant . here",

    "the noise correlation time scale is found roughly from by the thermal gaussian bath spectral width as @xmath84 . at the markovian limit ,",
    "the environmental correlation time @xmath85 is much smaller than the rd times . for two level systems this condition",
    "can be met provided that the system noise - coupling is sufficiently small . however , for mls , the question of whether the markovian condition is satisfied is more nontrivial .",
    "the basic reason is that in the mls there is a larger number of time scales and decay channels of which presence may considerably reduce the effective decoherence times .    in this work ,",
    "the numerical solution of ( [ densmatr.2 ] ) is performed by discretizing time in steps @xmath86 .",

    "( [ fig4 ] ) the first observation is that , exponential rd is effective immediately in the short time regime @xmath99 .",
    "we also confirmed numerically that the asympthotic time behaviour as well as the rd rates are independent of the initially prepared state .",
    "as the asymptotic time behaviour is concerned , for symmetric configurations ( pure @xmath100 coupling ) , the density matrix converges to the maximum entropy ( informationless ) limit @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the unit matrix , irrespectively from the spectral properties of the noise or the system - noise coupling .",

    "we also confirm that all regions in the noise spectrum have strong influence on rd .",
    "for this observation , one has to compare fig s .",
    "[ fig4]-[alpha.nu ] correponding to different spectral properties and temperatures .",
    "for instance , for @xmath104 and @xmath97 [ see fig.[fig4 ] ] , we recover the under damped and weak dephasing limit of @xcite for all @xmath49 . in addition , no oscillations are observed in the sd configuration .",
    "larger rd rates are observed as @xmath49 is made to be more negative towards @xmath105 .",
    "we identify this behaviour as the manifestation of the region - ii in the noise spectrum ( see the end of section ii.a ) .",
    "more data are also shown in the same figure for indicating the effect of various @xmath41 values . in fig.[fig4b ] the nondegenerate case with an energy difference between the levels @xmath107 is shown for @xmath108 and for various temperatures .",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath109 curves again yield weaker rd rates within the indicated temperature ranges . another noticable feature in fig.[fig4b ]",
    "is the weakly oscillating behaviour .",
    "the weak oscillations are more prominent at high temperatures and short times . in this case for @xmath110 the system - noise coupling is large due to the large number of thermally activated environmental modes .",
    "this behaviour , which is characterized by weakly damped rabi - like oscillations , was predicted in the analytic calculations of leggett et al . in order to examine the influence of the spectral width @xmath48 a similar zero temperature plot as in fig.[fig4 ] is made in fig.[fig5 ] for a wider spectral width @xmath111 .",
    "comparing this figure with fig.[fig4 ] , a crossover in the time dependence of the rdm can be observed in the @xmath112 plane .",
    "( the crossover can also be activated thermally as to be seen in the following fig.s [ alpha.t ] and [ alpha.nu ] . )    , @xmath95 and @xmath111 . ]",
    "there are a number of ways to increase the effective system - noise coupling .",
    "the following fig.[alpha.t ] gives a sample from the @xmath113 behaviour for the asymmetric potential configuration .",
    "increasing the temperature increases the coupling by filling the available photon modes for @xmath114 .",
    "the sample data is shown for @xmath115 at @xmath116 and @xmath105 ( indicated by the filled and opaque symbols connected with solid lines ) . the second way to increase",
    "the system - noise coupling is to directly increase @xmath41 ( indicated by the dotted dashed lines ) . in the small coupling regime ,",
    "for which the sample data is shown for @xmath117 at @xmath97 @xmath105 and for an increased @xmath48 ( @xmath118 ) , the rdm experiences stronger damping .",
    "the weakly damped oscillations survive at short times at finite and small temperatures .",
    "the larger the temperature the larger the amplitude of the oscillations and the faster they diminish .    for completeness",
    "we also add in fig.[alpha.nu ] the behaviour in the @xmath112 plane at zero temperature .",
    "a comparison between the fig s [ alpha.t ] and [ alpha.nu ] reveals a temperature modulated crossover ( confirm , for instance , a similar decay of the sets for @xmath119 at @xmath120 in fig.[alpha.t ] with @xmath121 at @xmath97 in fig.[alpha.nu ] ) .",
    "the major difference of the model interaction hamiltonian in ( [ sysnoise.1 ] ) from the standard ( @xmath122-type ) spin - boson model is in the manipulation of the potential .",
    "in contrast to the standard spin - boson model , in our case only non - diagonal , @xmath100 , type coupling is present under the symmetric potential [ see fig.[dipole.1 ] ] . as a result",
    ", dramatic differences in the time dependence of the reduced system are observed between the two models .",
    "for instance , the diagonal coupling is standardly considered for the study of pure dephasing . in this type of coupling the relaxation",
    "is manifestly forbidden and the initial states do not change their populations .",
    "the diagonal coupling also yields strongly temperature dependendent dephasing rates with the rates vanishing at @xmath97 . on the other hand , when the system - noise coupling is not diagonal , the induced transitions between the system states can probe the entire noise spectrum creating decoherence even at zero temperature .",
    "these induced transitions are nonresonant and they have observable effects particularly in the short time dynamics of the rdm@xcite .",
    "the rd times observed as the result of such system - noise coupling are expected to be nonzero even at zero temperature .",
    "this characteristic behaviour of the non - diagonal coupling is confirmed in our calculations both for the 2ls in figs.[fig4]-[alpha.nu ] and for the mls in the following sections .",
    "recently , there are other claims using realistic models on decoherence effects in mesoscopic systems@xcite as well as a few experimental confirmations on the saturation of the rd rates at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "behaviour of the rdm is shown for an asymmetric potential with @xmath123 .",
    "the noise parameters are @xmath124 , @xmath118 and @xmath105 . ]     and @xmath49 values at @xmath97 and @xmath95 for the asymmetric potential with @xmath123 .",
    "the crossover from the weakly oscillating damped behaviour at short times to strong relaxation at longer times can be observed . ]",
    "a curious observation in fig s [ fig4]-[alpha.nu ] is the strong dependence of rd time scales on the spectral width @xmath48 .",
    "a naive expectation is that for @xmath125 and at very small temperatures the resonant transitions are unfavoured and there are no environmental modes available therefore the relaxation should be inhibited .",
    "the point that is often missed in this popular argument is the different role played by the short time nonresonant transitions .",
    "the resonant transitions are favoured when the system interacts with the environment at _ sufficiently large times_. the system however relaxes differently at short times by prefering to stay off - resonant in its interaction with the noise field thereby sampling all regions of the noise spectrum .",
    "this causes the strong dependence on @xmath48 we observe at short times .    in summary",
    ", it is confirmed that the rich transient effects are observed usually in the short time behaviour in which all energy scales in the noise spectrum take part rendering the relaxation process sensitive to the relative magnitudes of those scales .",
    "we confirmed the several crossover regions that have been predicted in the path integral influence functional calculations .",
    "the decoherence and dephasing dynamics is governed by all frequency regions in the noise spectrum . in particular , the short time behaviour is affected strongly by all frequency regions due to the nonresonant processes . for @xmath126 , fig.[fig4 ] indicates that as @xmath49 increases in the interval @xmath60 the relaxation rates gradually increase still remaining in the weak relaxation regime .",
    "a crossover in the @xmath127 plane is observed [ compare with fig.[fig5 ] ] as @xmath48 is increased . with this being the case for symmetric potentials , for asymmetric ones the additional feature of weak oscillations",
    "are present in the short time dynamics .",
    "the effect of multileveledness on decoherence has not yet received the attention that it deserves in the literature .",
    "this is , in part , due to the lack of practical analytic tools in solving the master equation . the complexity of the formal methods such as the noninteracting blip approximation increases at each time step as @xmath129 which renders the analytic sum over all virtual configurations in the path integral approach intractable .",
    "usually , the common argument is that , for sufficiently low temperatures , a multilevel system , of which the first two levels ( the qubit ) are sufficiently well separated from the rest , behaves as a two state system .",
    "we have already observed that there are two major pitfalls in this assumption .",
    "firstly , it excludes the very realistic case in which decohering effects are induced through interactions with a strongly fluctuating quantum field .",
    "in such a case , the fluctuations in the distribution of environmental modes in the noise spectrum is the major source of decoherence .",
    "secondly , and more generally , the short time behaviour of a mls -which is the most prominent regime in the quantum computational perspective- is affected by a large frequency region in the noise spectrum .",
    "these comprise the basic motivation of why we should look into the effect of higher levels on decoherence in a mls",
    ". we will continue by examining the cases @xmath5 and @xmath130 separately .",
    "in particular , we remark on certain interesting decoherence properties of the doubly degenerate systems with @xmath4 .    * @xmath5 case *    from the quantum computational point of view , the three level systems are as important as the two level ones ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the linblad approach was used for the rdm of a multilevel system in connection with the quantum zeno effect@xcite .",

    "this confinement can be observed all the way up to much higher spectral widths such as @xmath111 as long as the gaussian suppression is manifested .",
