    "we present another new example of exact solutions : a gauss - bonnet generalization of the vaidya solution , which in einstein gravity originally describes a spacetime outside a radiating `` star '' with the energy - momentum tensor of a null fluid  @xcite . in the recent literature",
    "the vaidya - type solution in an ads spacetime is frequently used to investigate consequences of the braneworld emitting gravitons into the extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "using our new vaidya - type solution , we construct a toy model for a radiating gauss - bonnet braneworld , giving an evolution equation for the `` dark radiation '' parameter .",

    "tackling this issue further seems beyond the scope of this paper .    .",
    "the gauss - bonnet coupling is given by @xmath104 .",
    "( the explicit form of the mode function is found in ref .",
    "in the framework of einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , which involves a unique combination of quadratic curvature terms , we have obtained an exact solution that describes a radiating spacetime filled with a null fluid . in einstein gravity such a solution is called the vaidya metric , and is constructed by allowing the mass parameter of the schwarzschild or ( a)ds - schwarzschild black hole solution to depend on the null coordinate : @xmath105 .",
    "simply and surprisingly , the same procedure gives the radiating solution of the einstein - gauss - bonnet field equations with the energy - momentum tensor of the same null fluid form .",
