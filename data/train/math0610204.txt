    "if the arf invariant of @xmath3 is trivial , then the normal invariant of @xmath41 is trivial , and so @xmath41 is normally cobordant to the identity .",
    "in fact , the normal cobordism is easy to construct ` by hand ' . following  @xcite ,",
    "the vanishing of @xmath134 gives rise to an explicit normal cobordism , relative to the boundary , of the map @xmath132 to the identity of @xmath121 .",
    "as in the proof of lemma  [ l : homotopy ] , this normal cobordism ( crossed with @xmath135 ) can be glued to the identity map on @xmath136 to give the desired normal cobordism .    if @xmath137 , then we make use of a classic construction of wall  @xcite that is discussed carefully in  @xcite . given a class in @xmath138 represented by a map @xmath139 , consider the composition @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the generator of @xmath142 .",

    "note that the image of the hurewicz map is determined via the hopf exact sequence @xmath149 since @xmath150 , the hurewicz map is onto , so in particular the class @xmath119 is spherical and we get a homotopy equivalence @xmath151 .",
    "recall that @xmath152 , so it has trivial normal bundle .",

    "( for @xmath43 odd and @xmath11 closed , this argument can be found in  @xcite . ) finally , since the map on the boundary is the identity , the homeomorphism extends over @xmath2 .",
    "note that when @xmath0 is a rim torus ( or annular rim torus as in  @xcite ) , the homology class @xmath0 is trivial in @xmath162 .",

    "in retrospect , it seems remarkable that plotnick was able to show that in many cases @xmath226 is actually @xmath228 , whereas showing that its fundamental group is trivial seems somewhat difficult , computationally .",
    "let s review briefly the annulus rim surgery construction from  @xcite .",
    "suppose that there is a smoothly embedded surface @xmath36 in @xmath2 , called a ` membrane ' , such that @xmath265 , @xmath266 and @xmath36 meets @xmath7 normally along @xmath267 . by adjusting a trivialization of its regular neighborhood @xmath268",
    ", we can assume that @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is a disjoint union of two unknotted segments of a part of the boundary of a band @xmath271 in @xmath200 . here",
    "the band @xmath271 is trivially embedded in @xmath200 and the intersection @xmath272 . then given a knot @xmath3 in @xmath4",
    ", we consider a band @xmath273 obtained by knotting @xmath274 along @xmath3 and denote by @xmath275 the pair of arcs bounding @xmath276 .",
    "note that the framing of @xmath276 is chosen the same as the framing of @xmath274 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) ) . then we get a new surface @xmath277 as follows : @xmath278    there is an equivalent description for this construction using knot surgery .",
    "let @xmath231 be a meridian of @xmath274 in @xmath200 .",
    "then there is a torus @xmath279 corresponding to @xmath280 , and @xmath281 is constructed by knot surgery on this torus . in finashin s original construction , the gluing map @xmath10 sends @xmath282\\mapsto [ s^1]$ ] , @xmath283 , and @xmath169 .",
    "more generally , we can do @xmath172-twists and @xmath173-rolls in this construction , resulting in a gluing map @xmath10 of  .",
    "knot surgery using @xmath10 of   preserves the fundamental group @xmath179 .",
    "in other words , @xmath172-twisted and @xmath173-rolled annulus rim surgery is a cyclic surgery .",
    "let s consider the process of @xmath172-times twist - spinning and @xmath173-times rolling of a knot @xmath3 in @xmath4 .",
    "choose a regular neighborhood @xmath284 containing a knotted band @xmath276 described in finashin s construction .",
    "we define self diffeomorphisms @xmath183 and @xmath184 on @xmath285 in the same way as   and  .",
    "then @xmath183 is fixed on @xmath286 and with support in a collar of @xmath286 and induces a conjugation by a meridian .",
    "similarly , @xmath184 is a conjugation by a longitude .",
    "then we can observe that @xmath33 obtained by knot surgery ( definition  [ knotsurgery ] ) along the above torus @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath287 applying the van kampen theorem to this decomposition of @xmath33 and following the similar argument in  @xcite , we can get that @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the inclusion homomorphism and @xmath290 is the kernel of the inclusion homomorphism @xmath291 .",
    "the group @xmath292 is generated by @xmath282 $ ] and three generators denoted by @xmath293 , @xmath294 , and @xmath295 for @xmath296 where @xmath297= @xmath298 is represented by a loop around one arc of @xmath41 in @xmath200 and @xmath299 is represented by a loop around @xmath41 under the inclusion @xmath300 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .",
    "so the kernel @xmath290 is generated by @xmath282 $ ] , @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and @xmath295 . since @xmath303)$ ] kills the first factor of @xmath304 , the group @xmath92 can be written by @xmath305 where we omit @xmath306 to simplify the notation .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the relation @xmath295 has the same effect on @xmath307 as attaching a @xmath118-cell along a loop @xmath308 turning around @xmath276 in @xmath200 . adding this @xmath118-cell makes @xmath275 an unknotted arc @xmath309 in @xmath200 ( see fig .",
    "2 which is the same figure in  @xcite ) .",
    "so only one generator @xmath293 of @xmath310 becomes the generator for @xmath311 ( to see this , note that @xmath293 is represented by a loop around @xmath309 ) . by geometric observation , we know that @xmath312 is the conjugate of @xmath293 by @xmath295 and @xmath313 is the conjugate of @xmath293 by a longitude @xmath15 .",
    "but since @xmath295 and the longitude are killed in the group @xmath311 , the factorization by @xmath314 makes the group @xmath92 into a cyclic group @xmath208 .",
    "in the proof of lemma  [ split ] , we gave a formula for evaluating the normal invariant of a map of @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "it was pointed out to us by ian hambleton that sullivan s characteristic variety theorem , on which this evaluation is based , does not have a complete proof in the literature . because @xmath1 is a fairly low dimension ,",
    "it is possible to assemble a straightforward proof based on well - established facts in surgery theory , and we present such a proof in this appendix .",
    "we treat the closed pl case first ; extension to the bounded case is routine .",
    "the top case follows by the same reasoning using the computation  @xcite of the homotopy groups of @xmath315 .",
    "the statement we want is that pl normal maps to a closed oriented manifold @xmath2 are determined by two invariants , @xmath105 and @xmath316 where @xmath207 is the simply - connected surgery obstruction , given by the difference in signature divided by @xmath317 . by the universal coefficient theorem , @xmath318 is determined by the pairings @xmath319 for @xmath320 a surface ( not necessarily orientable ) in x. the claim is that ( for @xmath41 transverse to @xmath320 ) this evaluation is the arf invariant of the normal map @xmath321 .",
    "the proof starts from the fact , proved by transversality and valid in any dimension , that pl normal maps to a closed manifold x are given by homotopy classes @xmath322 $ ] .",
    "now it is well - known ( cf .",
    "for example  @xcite ) that the first two nonzero homotopy groups of @xmath323 are @xmath324 and @xmath325 , and @xmath326 .",
    "the first @xmath290-invariant in the pl case is @xmath327 ; in the top case it is trivial .",
    "this is enough to determine that @xmath322 $ ] is the set @xmath328 .",
    "suppose that @xmath329 is a normal map , and that @xmath330 is an embedded surface with @xmath331 transverse to @xmath320 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath331 is a normal map @xmath332 .",
    "moreover , the classifying map for @xmath41 = normal map of surfaces in @xmath333 $ ] is the composition of the classifying map for @xmath331 in @xmath322 $ ] with the inclusion @xmath334 .",
    "this holds because the normal bundle of @xmath335 in @xmath36 is the pull - back of the normal bundle of @xmath320 in @xmath2 .",
    "the formula we need then follows from the following statement : if @xmath336 is a normal map of surfaces classified by a map @xmath337 , and @xmath338 is the generator , then @xmath339 .",
    "this can be seen in many ways , e.g. it follows directly from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .",
