    "in @xcite , a state sum , or spinfoam model , for discretized euclidean signature general relativity was proposed .",
    "the model was made finite by passing from the representations of @xmath0 , the euclidean lorentz algebra , to its q - deformation at a root of unity . in @xcite , a better motivated normalization for the model in @xcite",
    "was derived , and it was conjectured that with this new normalization the model was finite on any finitely triangulated manifold without passing to the quantum group .",
    "the finiteness conjecture was proved in @xcite .",
    "the same normalization was obtained , from a different perspective , in @xcite .    in @xcite , a lorentzian signature version of the state model in @xcite",
    "was proposed .",
    "it was suggested that the model could be made finite by passing to the representations of the quantum lorentz algebra @xcite . in @xcite , a change of normalization , similar to the one that made finite the euclidean model ,",
    "was proposed for the lorentzian model .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to prove that the lorentzian signature model of @xcite with the normalization of @xcite is in fact _",
    "finite _ for any finite triangulation of a 4-manifold .",
    "this result is remarkable .",
    "the model is an integral over infinite domains of terms each of which is the trace of an operator on certain infinite dimensional representations of the lorentz algebra , the balanced unitary ones .",
    "if we adopt the point of view of @xcite that the sum on a specific triangulation should be interpreted as a term in a perturbation series @xcite , this result implies that up to the issue of singular triangulations discussed below the theory is finite order by order , since there are only a finite number of triangulations with a given number of 4-simplices . for a theory of four dimensional lorentzian quantum general relativity",
    ", perturbative finiteness is significant .",
    "finiteness on nondegenerate triangulations is proven here with mathematical rigor .",
    "the proof relies on technology developed in @xcite .    at the moment",
    "our proof does not work for degenerate triangulations , and we do not know if these give finite contributions or not .",
    "this will require a more delicate analysis of the relevant integrals .",
    "in the euclidean context , singular triangulations are finite @xcite .",
    "the finiteness of the model is the result of several mathematical surprises .",
    "the finiteness of the individual 10j symbols comes about by representing them as multiple integrals on hyperbolic space , then making the extremely simple regularization of omitting any single integration .",
    "this regularization does not break any of the symmetries .",
    "this procedure does not work for spin nets for arbitrary unitary representations of the lorentz algebra , but only for the balanced ones @xcite .",
    "the finiteness of the complete state sum on any finite triangulation , which we prove in this paper , depends then on a rather delicate relationship between asymptotic estimates for the relativistic spin nets which go into it .",
    "we recall the definition of the model in section 2 , we prove its finiteness in section 3 , and discuss the result in section 4 .",
    "we do not review any of the derivations or the motivations of the model here , but merely recall its definition .",
    "we refer the reader to the bibliography for a thorough introduction .",
    "the principal series unitary representations of the lorentz algebra @xmath1 are denoted @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an integer and @xmath4 is a nonnegative real number .",
    "the balanced representations are those with @xmath5 ; they are just labelled with @xmath4 .",
    "we construct the state sum model by taking a ( fixed ) nondegenerate finite triangulation of a 4-manifold , with or without boundary .",
    "we label each 2-simplex @xmath6 of the triangulation with a balanced representation of the lorentz algebra , or , more simply , with a positive real parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the state sum is then given by the expression @xmath8 the integration is over the labels of all internal faces ( the faces not belonging to the boundary ) .",
    "the three products run over the the 2-simplices @xmath6 , the 3-simplices @xmath9 and the 4-simplices @xmath10 of the triangulation , respectively ( the choice of the letter refers to corresponding dual elements : faces , edges and vertices . ) the labels @xmath11 are the ones of the four 2-simplices adjacent to the 3-simplex @xmath9 .",
    "the labels @xmath12 are the ones of the ten 2-simplices adjacent to the 4-simplex @xmath10 .",
    "the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined as traces of recombination diagrams for the balanced representations , regularized as explained in @xcite . the function @xmath13 is given by the diagram in figure 1 .",
    "it was discovered to play a role in the model in @xcite and its evaluation is in @xcite . the function @xmath14 is given by the diagram in figure 2 .",
    "these traces are called relativistic spin networks . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "these relativistic spin networks can be explicitly expressed as multiple integrals on the upper sheet @xmath15 of the @xmath16-sheeted hyperboloid in minkowski space . to this purpose",
    ", we define the projector kernel @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hyperbolic distance between @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ". then the trace of a recombination diagram is given by a multiple integral of products of @xmath21 s .",
    "more precisely , by one integral over @xmath15 per each node , of the product on one kernel per each link .",
    "the integral is then normalized by dropping one of the integrations . by lorentz symmetry ,",
    "the result is independent of the point not integrated over .",
    "thus in particular @xmath13 and @xmath14 are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 equations ( [ one][i10 ] ) define the state sum completely . for a four dimensional manifold with boundary , ( [ one ] ) gives a function of the boundary labels .",
    "these functions can be interpreted as three - geometry to three - geometry transition amplitudes , computed to a certain order in a perturbative expansion .",
    "they can be viewed as the ( in principle ) observable quantities of a quantum theory of gravity , as explained in @xcite .",
    "each term in the sum ( [ one ] ) is a multiple integral on an unbounded domain .",
    "the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 were shown to be bounded in @xcite and @xcite . therefore convergence is a question of sufficiently rapid decay at infinity .",
    "since we are assuming a nondegenerate triangulation , each 2-simplex in ( [ one ] ) appears in at least three distinct 3-simplices and at least three distinct 4-simplices .",
    "therefore , by power counting , we need a combined power law decay at infinity adding to more than 1 in the combination of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 factors for each @xmath4 separately .",
    "as we show below , the @xmath13 factor has a power law decay with exponent 3/4 , while the @xmath14 has a decay with exponent 3/10 .",
    "the first exponent seems to be sharp , the second can probably be strengthened but not by very much .",
    "we now supply a rigorous proof of finiteness .",
    "we begin with two results by baez and barrett in @xcite , which we state without proof .    [ bound ] ( baez - barrett ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 are bounded .",
    "this follows immediately from theorems 1 , 2 and 3 of @xcite    ( baez - barrett ) [ inductive ] if @xmath24 , the integral @xmath25 converges , and for any @xmath26 there exists a constant @xmath27 such that for any choice of the points @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hyperbolic distance @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this result , ( lemma 5 in reference @xcite ) is one of the fundamental tools in the proof of lemma [ bound ] .",
    "the @xmath34 relativistic spin network satisfies the following bound @xmath35 for any arbitrary triple @xmath36 .    from the fact that @xmath37 we have that @xmath38 as it is shown in @xcite , @xmath39 from this we have @xmath40 and ( [ eq : lemma2 ] ) follows .    [ four ] for any subset of @xmath41 elements @xmath42 out of the corresponding four representations appearing in @xmath13",
    "the following bounds hold @xmath43 for some positive constant @xmath44 .",
    "the case @xmath45 corresponds to equation ( [ tete ] ) .",
    "for @xmath46 we observe that in the definition of @xmath47 in ( [ tete ] ) we can obtain a bound containing @xmath41 different @xmath4 s in the denominator by bounding @xmath48 of the three @xmath49 s by @xmath50 .",
    "for the case @xmath51 we can write four inequalities as in the previous lemma choosing different triplets . multiplying the four inequalities each representation appears repeated three times",
    "so we obtain the exponent @xmath52 in the bound .",
    "[ 6j ] the tetrahedron amplitude @xmath53 ( see figure 3 ) satisfies @xmath54 for a constant @xmath21 , and any choice of three non vanishing colorings @xmath55 , and @xmath56 in the same triangle .",
    "we study the integral @xmath57 for any choice of numbers @xmath58 for @xmath59 and a point @xmath60 .",
    "first we integrate out @xmath61 using lemma [ inductive ] , obtaining @xmath62 .",
    "we can bound the previous expression by @xmath63 lets concentrate on the @xmath64 integration . in order to do",
    "so we use a coordinate system in which two of the coordinates are @xmath65 while the third is the angle @xmath66 between @xmath64 and a given plane containing the geodesic between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the ranges of these coordinates are @xmath69 where we set @xmath70 . in terms of this",
    "coordinates the measure @xmath71 becomes @xmath72 in terms of this coordinates ( [ inti ] ) becomes @xmath73 finally if we put in the form of the measure @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is the measure of the unit sphere ) , we can complete the integration to obtain the sought for bound , namely @xmath77 which concludes the proof .",
    "[ yo ] the 4-simplex amplitude @xmath14 satisfies the following bound : @xmath78 for some constant @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath79-simplex amplitude @xmath14 corresponds to introducing four additional @xmath49 in the multiple integral ( [ ghandi ] ) together with an additional integration corresponding to the four new edges and the additional vertex respectively . using lemma [ inductive ] this additional integration",
    "can be bounded by a constant , so that after using lemma [ 6j ] we have @xmath80 for any arbitrary triple @xmath81 in the same triangle .",
    "[ yo1 ] @xmath14 satisfies also the following bounds : @xmath82 where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are constant and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are in the same triangle .",
    "we observe that a different bound can be obtained for @xmath87 containing respectively two or one representations in the denominator if we bound either two or one of the three @xmath49 in ( [ interm ] ) by @xmath50 instead of just taking absolute value .",
    "the integration on the right still converges ( see @xcite ) .    using lemma",
    "[ yo ] and [ yo1 ] it is easy to prove the following corollary .",
    "[ ten ] for any subset of @xmath41 elements @xmath42 out of the corresponding ten representations appearing in @xmath14 the following bounds hold @xmath88 for some positive constant @xmath89 .    given a non singular triangulation , the state sum partition function @xmath90 is well defined , i.e. , the multiple integral in ( [ one ] ) converges .",
    "we divide each integration region @xmath91 into the intervals @xmath92 , and @xmath93 so that the multiple integral decomposes in a finite sum of integrations of the following types :    1 .",
    "all the integrations are in the range @xmath92 .",
    "we denote this term @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the number of 2-simplices in the triangulation .",
    "this term in the sum is finite by theorem [ bound ] .",
    "all the integrations are in the range @xmath93 .",
    "this term @xmath96 is also finite since using corollary [ four ] and [ ten ] for @xmath51 , and @xmath97 respectively we have @xmath98 3 .   @xmath99 integrations in @xmath92 , and @xmath100 in @xmath93 . in this case",
    "@xmath101 can be bounded using corollaries ( [ four ] ) and ( [ ten ] ) as before .",
    "the idea is to choose the appropriate subset of representations in the bounds ( and the corresponding values of @xmath41 ) so that only the @xmath102 representations integrated over @xmath93 appear in the corresponding denominators .",
    "since this is clearly possible , the @xmath103 terms are all finite .",
    "we have bounded @xmath90 by a finite sum of finite terms which concludes the proof .",
    "given the history of attempts to quantize general relativity , the finiteness of the lorentzian state sum is remarkable , and came to us as a surprise . the model is the result of a number of choices made from physical or geometrical arguments .",
    "altering one of those choices seems to generally have the effect of destroying the finiteness .",
    "an example is the uncertainty , in the older 15j formulation , as to whether to sum independently on the internal spins in tetrahedra or to require them to be equal .",
    "the version of the model studied here has @xmath13 terms which can be thought of as sums of 6j terms , or alternatively as diagrams which have the effect of forcing the two internal labels to be equal .",
    "thus finiteness seems to impose a choice here , the other version would almost certainly diverge .",
    "similarly , without the balanced constraint of @xcite , the model would also , most likely , be divergent .",
    "that constraint can be deduced from geometrical thinking or from the plebansky formulation of general relativity ; both derivations are unrelated to the representation theory which ensued , so it is interesting that it plays a critical role in finiteness .    in order to turn the model into a complete theory ,",
    "it is necessary to handle the limit as the number of simplices in a triangulation goes to infinity .",
    "it is possible to imagine several plausible approaches to this .",
    "the simplest would be to cut off the number of triangulations and regularize , hoping for a good limit .",
    "the conjecture of quantum self censorship of @xcite might play a role , either in this model or in an extended one with matter terms added , in ensuring that such a limit would exist ; the intuition being that any new information in a sufficiently large triangulation would fall into its schwarzschild radius , and hence not affect physically observable quantities .    an alternative to just studying the limit of larger triangulations is to sum over triangulations , or suitably extended triangulations @xcite . from this perspective , the state sum we have studied here is a term in the feynman expansion of an auxiliary field theory @xcite .",
    "the field theory fixes the relative weights in the sum over extended triangulations , which includes also a sum over spacetime topologies . in this perspective , the result in this paper is the finiteness of feynman integrals . in such a context , however , singular triangulations appear as well , an issue not addressed here .",
    "finiteness on singular triangulations requires us to get a power decay law above 3/4 for the @xmath14 integrals .",
    "we do not know if this is possible or not .",
    "the question of including manifolds with conical singularities , or equivalently , more general 2-complexes , is related to this .",
    "the possibility of discrete geons is therefore open .",
    "another question which we think deserves to be investigated is the finiteness of the variant of the model considered in @xcite , in which timelike as well as spacelike balanced representations are used , and in which the discreteness characteristic of the canonical theory @xcite reappear .",
    "more generally , the results presented here emerge from the comparison of two different ways of viewing spinfoam models : the quantum geometric and field theoretic ones .",
    "we believe that comparing this approach with the techniques and the results from the other approaches to the construction of spinfoam models , such as the ones of reisenberger @xcite , freidel and krasnov @xcite and iwasaki @xcite , is likely to be productive as well .",
    "the suggestion that quantum geometry is in some sense discrete is an old idea in quantum gravity : it can be traced all the way to einstein @xcite .",
    "we view the categorical algebraic elegance of the current model in which such discreteness is realized , and its close relationship to tqfts , as particularly attractive .",
    "the structural similarity between categorical state sums and the feynman vacuum , emphasized in @xcite , is also suggestive .",
    "because of the finiteness proof given here , it is now possible to explore the consequences of these ideas and the physical content of this model by exact calculation ."
