    "in the study of a flux relaxation and vortex penetration phenomenon , an important step is to find out an expression of the vortex activation energy .",
    "the flux relaxation and vortex penetration can be regarded as the processes of vortex hopping between the adjacent pinning centers.@xcite therefore , they can be described by the arrhenius relation @xcite , which shows that the vortex hopping rate has a strong dependence on the temperature and vortex activation energy . because the vortex hopping rate can be changed by a current density ( or internal field ) , the activation energy is a function of the current density ( or internal field ) . by proposing a detailed activation energy ,",
    "one can obtain the corresponding time evolution equation of the current density ( or internal field ) .",
    "a number of activation energies were proposed on the basis of different physical considerations . in the flux relaxation process",
    ", we have linear activation energy @xcite , quadratic activation energy , series activation energy @xcite , inverse - power activation energy @xcite and logarithmic activation energy @xcite . in the vortex penetration process",
    ", we have linear activation energy , quadratic activation energy , and series activation energy.@xcite    one can see that the flux relaxation and vortex penetration phenomena are currently described with multiple models .",
    "the present work is motivated by the following facts :    first , it is now understood that the early developed infinite series models of flux relaxation and vortex penetration @xcite are constructed at zero points ( vanishing current density and vanishing internal field ) . from mathematics , we know that one needs to choose a `` center point '' when doing a taylor series expansion of a function .",
    "this means that it is possible to reformulate the theoretical models by choosing the new center points .",
    "the critical current density and equilibrium internal field are important parameters in the application of a superconductor.@xcite therefore , we are interested in reconstructing the polynomial models at these critical points .",
    "second , the inverse - power activation energy @xcite and logarithmic activation energy @xcite are functions of inverse current density .",
    "they give good description to the flux relaxation process over the random pinning in the high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "this led us to consider whether the `` inverse current dependence '' implies a more general physical law that includes the inverse - power activation energy and logarithmic activation energy as special cases .",
    "it could be meaningful to extract out this common property and describe it with a unified mathematical equation which can be applied to a wide class of vortex systems .",
    "finally , the activation energy of a vortex penetration process is currently expressed as a function of the internal field.@xcite but the activation energy with an inverse internal field dependence is unavailable .",
    "similar to that in the flux relaxation process , therefore , it is desirable to propose an inverse model for the vortex penetration process .",
    "the inverse models must be constructed at the critical points because they diverge at vanishing current density ( or vanishing internal field ) .    in this article",
    ", we expanded the vortex activation energies at the critical points and developed the new polynomial models and inverse models of vortex dynamics .",
    "surface barrier @xcite is included in the activation energy , but geometrical barrier @xcite is ignored because it depends on the shape of sample .",
    "the information about the anisotropy of the superconductors is included in the activation energy , which is related to the coherence length and penetration depth .",
