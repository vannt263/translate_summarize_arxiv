    "in many branches of sciences like finance , economics , biology , engineering , ecology one often encountered some problems influenced by uncertainties .",
    "for example , in finance , the unpredictable nature of events such as markets crashes and booms may have significant and sudden impact on the stock price fluctuations .",
    "therefore , in order to have more realistic prediction of these phenomena , it is natural to model them with equations which involves the deterministic part and the random part including jump .",
    "the sdes with jumps is the generalization of both deterministic part and random part with jumps .",
    "sdes with jumps have probability theory and stochastic process as prerequisites .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for general notions in probability theory and stochastic process .    in this thesis , under global lipschitz condition",
    ", we prove the existence and uniqueness of solution of sdes with jumps .",
    "we focus on the strong convergence of the compensated stochastic theta methods ( cstm ) of these equations under global lipschitz condition .",
    "in particular , we prove that cstm have strong convergence of order @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate the stability of both cstm and stochastic theta method ( stm ) . for the linear case",
    ", we prove that under the assumption @xmath1 , cstm holds the a - stability property . for the general nonlinear problem ,",
    "we study the stability for @xmath2 . in this case , when the drift coefficient have a negative one - sided lipschitz coefficient , the diffusion coefficient and the jump coefficient satisfy the global lipschitz condition , we prove that stm reproduce stability under certain step - size and the cstm is stable for any step - size .",
    "most phenomena are modelised by sdes with jumps where the drift coefficient is one - sided lipschitz and satisfies the polynomial growth condition .",
    "for such equations , it is proved in @xcite that euler explicit method fails to converge strongly to the exact solution while euler implicit method converges strongly , but requires much computational efforts .",
    "recently , a new explicit and efficient method was developed in @xcite called tamed euler scheme . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that the tamed euler converges strongly with order 0.5 to the exact solution of sdes under non - global lipschitz condition . in this thesis ,",
    "we extend the tamed euler scheme by introducing a compensated tamed euler scheme for sdes with jumps .",
    "we prove that this scheme converges strongly with standard order @xmath0 .",
    "we also extend the semi - tamed euler developed in @xcite and we prove that this scheme converge strongly with order @xmath0 for sdes with jumps . as a consequence of this latter result",
    ", we prove the strong convergence of the tamed euler scheme for sdes with jumps .",
    "the stability analysis of both tamed euler and semi - tamed euler are done in this thesis .",
    "this thesis is organized as follows . in chapter 1",
    ", we recall some basic notions in probability theory and stochastic process .",
    "chapter 2 is devoted to the proof of the existence and uniqueness of sdes with jumps under global lipschitz condition . in chapter 3 , we focus on the strong convergence of the cstm and the stability analysis of both cstm and stm . in chapter 4 , under non - global lipschitz condition we investigate the strong convergence of the compensated tamed euler scheme . in chapter 5 , under non - global lipschitz condition , we investigate the strong convergence and stability of both semi - tamed euler scheme and tamed euler scheme .",
