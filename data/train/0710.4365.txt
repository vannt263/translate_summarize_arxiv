    "tetraquarks were proposed decades ago .",
    "early in 1977 , jaffe make a calculation using the color - magnetic interaction in the bag model @xcite . he suggested that the light scalar mesons below 1 gev , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , be interpreted as a nonet of light tetraquarks .    in recent years , the light scalar mesons are observed in decays of charmed mesons .",
    "the @xmath3 is observed as a peak in decay @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath2 in @xmath5 @xcite . from the process @xmath6 ,",
    "bes collaboration determined the pole position of @xmath3 to be @xmath7 mev@xcite . also bes collaboration found a @xmath2 like structure in the decay @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the accumulation of experimental data allows us to study the structure of the light scalar nonet based on their decay properties @xcite .    as a many - body system ,",
    "a tetraquark state is quite different from a baryon or a conventional @xmath9 meson .",
    "the color structure is no longer trivial .",
    "it is quite sensitive to the hidden color structure of qcd interaction . a tetraquark state , if its existence is confirmed , may provide us important information about the qcd interaction that is absent from the ordinary baryons or the @xmath9 mesons .",
    "for instance , some authors had investigated the tetraquark system with the three - body @xmath10 and @xmath11 interaction , whose existence has no direct effect on the ordinary hadron states @xcite .",
    "the newly updated experimental data can shed more light on the relation of the possible tetraquark states and qcd interaction .    in this article",
    ", we will study the possible tetraquark state within the framework of the non - relativistic potential model .",
    "we will calculate mass spectra and wave functions of the light tetraquark using the bhaduri potential@xcite . to fit the experimental masses",
    ", we will extend the model with the three - body @xmath10 and @xmath11 interaction . using the wave functions of tetraquarks",
    ", we will determine the coupling constants of tetraquarks to mesons under the `` fall apart '' mechanism .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian and the multiple gaussian function method which is used to obtain the tetraquark wave functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we present the `` fall apart '' decay calculation with tetraquark wave function . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we present the numerical results . finally we will give a brief summary .",
    "in a non - relativistic quark model , usually the potentials are limited to the two - body interaction , which mainly consists of two parts : the @xmath12 color interaction including the confinement and the coulomb interaction of one - gluon exchange , and the @xmath13 color - magnetic interaction .",

    "the bhaduri potential @xcite is rather simple and gives a unified description of conventional hadron spectroscopy .",
    "also it is often used to discuss the tetraquark system @xcite .",
    "the potential reads @xmath20 the parameter values are @xmath21    in a tetraquark , some new interactions which have no direct effect on the ordinary hadrons may have significant contribution .",
    "for instance , one can introduce the following three - body @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions@xcite @xmath22,\\\\    v_{q\\bar{q}\\bar{q}}(\\bm{r}_i,\\bm{r}_j,\\bm{r}_k ) & = d^{abc } f_i^a f_j^{b * }    f_k^{c * } u_0 \\exp[-(r_{ij}^2 + r_{jk}^2 + r_{ki}^2)/r_0 ^ 2].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this article , since we will only treat the ground states of tetraquark , the spatial dependence of the three - body interaction is less important .",
    "so we will only add the following simplified interaction into the model hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) @xmath23 this interaction is diagonal in the diquark  anti - diquark color base of tetraquark    @xmath24_{\\bar{3 } } [ \\bar{q}\\bar{q}]_{3 } \\mid v_{3b } \\mid      [ qq]_{\\bar{3 } } [ \\bar{q}\\bar{q}]_{3 } \\rangle = - \\frac{20}{9}u_0,\\\\      \\langle [ qq]_{6 } [ \\bar{q}\\bar{q}]_{\\bar{6 } } \\mid v_{3b } \\mid      [ qq]_{6 } [ \\bar{q}\\bar{q}]_{\\bar{6 } } \\rangle = + \\frac{10}{9}u_0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an immediate consequence is that this three - body interaction has no direct contribution to any meson - meson coupling channel .    to explain our calculation method",
    ", we first define some convenient coordinates for tetraquark system as illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] @xcite ,    [ coord - x ] @xmath25    [ coord - y ] @xmath26    [ coord - z ] @xmath27",
    "@xmath28    the base wave function for the tetraquark will be the product of color , spin , flavor and spatial wave functions . the color and spin @xmath29 base function we use is of the following diquark anti - diquark coupling form :    * @xmath30 @xmath31 * @xmath32 @xmath33 * @xmath34 @xmath35    here the color wave function of the two ( anti-)quarks is labeled by @xmath36 dimension and the spin wave function is by the total spin .",

    "the @xmath40 diquarks and @xmath42 anti - diquarks further form a tetraquark nonet .",

    "the wave function of this form is well convergent and there exists many analytical expressions for different matrix elements .",
    "we will use it to construct the spatial wave function base @xcite .    under the hypothesis of jaffe ,",
    "the color - spin wave function of `` good '' diquark is the symmetric one @xmath46 . as the flavor wave function of the scalar nonet state is anti - symmetric",
    ", so the spatial wave function should be symmetric .",
    "that is the spatial wave function of tetraquark state should be invariant under @xmath47 and/or @xmath48 .",

    "the @xmath53 independent gaussian functions are obtained by the following process .",
    "first , we use one such symmetric gaussian function as the test wave function in variation to determine a base parameter set @xmath55 .",
    "the matrix @xmath56 will be specified by three principal values denoted @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and three euler angels @xmath60 which specified the orientation",
    ". then a complete parameter set @xmath61 is generated by first scaling to the principal values@xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 a scaling factor ; then we make an euler rotation @xmath60 .    by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the above nonorthogonal basis",
    ", we will obtain the mass and wave function of tetraquark states .",
    "the wave function can be expressed in the above base functions as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the flavor wave function , @xmath68 is the superposition coefficient .",
    "similar to case in pseudo - scalar mesons , the @xmath69 members @xmath70 , @xmath71 in the scalar nonet will mix with each other . to consider the mixing , we further introduce a mixing angle @xmath72 @xcite @xmath73 then @xmath74 and @xmath3 are the physically observable states . in this article , we do not discuss the underlying mechanism of this mixing .",
    "so we will merely treat the mixing angle @xmath72 as one additional parameter .",
    "several authors have used the effective lagrangian with @xmath41 symmetry to discuss the decay of light scalar nonet @xcite . here",
    "we can calculate the coupling constants using the tetraquark wave functions .",
