    "4u 1907 + 09 is an accretion powered x - ray binary pulsar which is accreting plasma from a blue supergiant companion star .",
    "it was discovered as an x - ray source by giacconi et al .",
    "( 1971 ) and has been studied using instruments on board ariel v ( marshall @xmath6 ricketts 1980 ) , tenma ( makishima et al . , 1984 )",
    ", exosat ( cook @xmath6 page 1987 ) , ginga ( makishima @xmath6 mihara 1992 , mihara 1995 ) , and rxte ( in t zand , strohmayer @xmath6 baykal 1997 , in t zand , baykal @xmath6 strohmayer 1998 , in t zand , strohmayer @xmath6 baykal 1998 ) . marshall @xmath6 ricketts ( 1980 ) first determined the orbital period of the binary at 8.38 days by analysing the data taken between 1974 and 1980 from a survey instrument on board ariel v. folding the light curve of these data , they found two flares , a primary and a secondary , each occurring at the same orbital phase .",
    "subsequent tenma observations of this source have shown a pulse period at 437.5 sec ( maksihima et al . , 1984 ) .",
    "later exosat ( cook @xmath6 page 1987 ) and recent rxte obsevations ( in t zand , baykal @xmath6 strohmayer 1998 , in t zand , strohmayer @xmath6 baykal 1998 ) have shown that these flares are locked to orbital phases separated by half an orbital period .",
    "makishima et al . , ( 1984 ) and cook @xmath6 page ( 1987 ) suggested that the two flares are due to an equatorial disk - like envelope around a companion star which is inclined with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "when the neutron star crosses the disk , the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star , therefore the x - ray flux , increases temporarily .",
    "transient @xmath7 sec oscillations have appeared during the secondary flare ( in t zand , baykal @xmath6 strohmayer 1998 ) .",
    "these oscillations may be interpreted as keplerian motion of an accretion disk near the magnetospheric radius . due to the long spin period",
    "the co - rotation radius is much larger than the magnetospheric radius corresponding to the magnetic field of 2.1 @xmath8 10@xmath9 gauss implied by a cyclotron feature in the x - ray spectrum ( cusumano et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "therefore 4u 1907 + 09 is not likely to be spinning near equilibrium , unlike other accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "the 18 second quasi periodic oscillation at the flare suggests the formation of transient accretion disks from the wind accretion ( in t zand , baykal @xmath6 strohmayer 1998 ) .",
    "another interesting feature of the source is the sudden decrease in x - ray intensity by a factor of @xmath10 10@xmath4 , during time intervals ranging from a few minutes to @xmath10 1.5 hour ( in t zand , strohmayer @xmath6 baykal 1997 ) .",
    "the spectra at the dipping activity and outside the dip periods were similar with no indication of large changes in the column density of cold circumstellar matter ( i.e. n@xmath11 remains below 10@xmath12 @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is suggested that the mass accretion rate ceased due to the inhomogeneous spherical wind from the companion .    in this work , we have investigated the stability of the spin down rate .",
    "this source has shown spin down rate changes less than @xmath10 8 @xmath14 within 12 years ( in t zand , strohmayer @xmath6 baykal 1998 ) . using the archival rxte observations",
    ", we measured three new pulse periods covering a time span of over 2 years in addition to the previous four pulse period measurements . with @xmath15 sec observations separated by intervals of the order of a month we have been able to connect the pulses in phase and to construct the timing solution extending over a year .",
    "the residuals of pulse arrival times yielded a very low noise strength .",
    "our findings imply that the source has a very stable spin down rate even over short time intervals , in contrast to the noise seen in other hmxrbs .",
    "the observations used in this work are listed in table 1 .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected with the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the pca instrument consists of an array of 5 proportional counters operating in the 2 - 60 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000 cm@xmath4 and a field of view of @xmath17 full width half half maximum .",
    "background light curves were generated using the background estimator models based on the rate of very large events ( vle ) , spacecraft activation and cosmic x - ray emission with the standard pca analysis tools ( ftools ) and were subtracted from the source light curve obtained from the event data .",
    "the background subtracted light curves were corrected with respect to the barycenter of the solar system . using the binary orbital parameters of 4u 1907 + 09 from rxte observations",
    "( in t zand , baykal @xmath6 strohmayer 1998 ) , the light curves are also corrected for binary motion of 4u 1907 + 09 ( see table 3 ) . from the long archival data string outside the intensity dips , pulse periods for 4u 1907",
    "+ 09 were found by folding the time series on statistically independent trial periods ( leahy et al .",
    "master pulses were constructed from these observations by folding the data on the period giving the maximum @xmath18 .",
    "the master pulses were arranged in 20 phase bins and represented by their fourier harmonics ( deeter & boynton 1985 ) and cross - correlated with the harmonic representation of average pulse profiles from each observation .",
    "the pulse arrival times are obtained from the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we have measured three new pulse periods from the longer observations .",
    "these are presented in figure 1 and listed in table 2 .",
    "we have found that the rate of change of the pulse period of 4u 1907 + 09 is stable .",
    "therefore we have been able to connect all pulse arrival times in phase over a 383 day time span .",
    "the pulse arrival times are fitted to the quadratic polynomial @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pulse phase offset deduced from the pulse timing analysis , @xmath21 is the mid - time of the observation , @xmath22 is the phase offset at t@xmath23 , @xmath24 is the deviation from the mean pulse frequency ( or additive correction to the pulse frequency ) , and @xmath25 is the pulse frequency derivative of the source .",
    "the pulse arrival times ( pulse cycles ) and the residuals of the fit after the removal of the quadratic polynomial are presented in the figure 2 and figure 3 respectively .",
    "table 3 presents the timing solution of 4u 1907 + 09 .",
    "the pulse frequency derivative @xmath26 hz s@xmath2 is measured from the pulse arrival times obtained in a sequence of 19 observations spread over 383 days .",
    "this value is consistent within 10 @xmath14 with the long term value obtained from the data displayed in figure 1 , @xmath0 = ( -3.54 @xmath1 hz s@xmath2 .",
    "the residuals of the fit give a random walk noise strengths at @xmath27 days , s@xmath28 rad@xmath4 sec@xmath5 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the normalized variances of pulse arrival times and residual pulse frequencies ( see cordes 1980 for further definitions of noise strength ) .",
    "this value is 4 decades lower than that of vela x-1 ( bildsten et al . , 1997 ) and it is only a factor 5 greater than that of the lmxrb pulsar 4u 1626 - 67 ( chakrabarty et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the noise strength of 4u 1626 - 67 was considered the smallest ever measured for an accretion powered x - ray source .",
    "this noise strength is indeed very low for a hmxrb pulsar .",
    "the stable spin down rate over the 15 years and the low level of noise strength is a unique property of this source among the hmxrbs .",
    "the spin down rate of 4u 1907 + 09 is only a factor four greater than that of the axp source 1e 2259 + 586 .",
    "furthermore the long term noise strength is one order of magnitude lower than the axp 1e 2259 + 586 ( baykal @xmath6 swank 1986 ) .",
    "the quiet and persistent spin down rate of 4u 1907 + 09 shows that an accreting pulsar can spin down quietly , for extended periods . for the axps as well as 1e 2259 + 586",
    ", the existence of long epochs of spin down has been interpreted as evidence that these sources are isolated pulsars in dipole spin down in which case the large spin down rates and periods would indicate large ( 10@xmath31 - 10@xmath32 gauss ) magnetic fields ( thompson @xmath6 duncan 1993 ) . the existence of known accreting sources with quiet and persistent spin down , as observed from 4u 1626 - 67 , and now 4u 1907 + 09 shows that quiet spin down does not necessarily imply that the source is not accreting .",
