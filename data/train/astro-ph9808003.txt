    "the study of the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has the potential to teach us a great deal about the background cosmology in which we live , about the formation of structure and about the early universe .",
    "because of this promise , esa selected the planck surveyor as the third medium sized mission of its horizon 2000 scientific program . with its wide range of frequencies , superb angular resolution , and high sensitivity , planck has been hailed as the definitive cmb anisotropy experiment .    while much of the cosmological information is expected to come from the angular power spectrum of _ primary _ anisotropies , the sky contains more than this simple imprint of the inhomogeneities at last scattering .",
    "in particular the brightness fluctuations should be dominated on the smallest scales by point sources .",
    "one of the collateral science goals of planck is to produce an all sky catalogue of such sources over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "recent observations suggest that there may be many more bright sub - millimetre sources than previously expected , and it is the purpose of this paper to explore the impact of these findings on the planck mission .",
    "while several authors ( see below ) have looked at the one - point statistics of these sub - mm galaxies , little has been done on the two - point function ( or power spectrum ) of these sources .",
    "it is this statistic which is most familiar to the cmb community , and which we concentrate on here .",
    "the most exciting recent observations in the sub - mm waveband have come from the new submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; holland et al .",
    "@xcite ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "a combination of the properties of the sky and the galaxies themselves make the scuba 850@xmath3 m  filter the optimal one for cosmology .",
    "this waveband corresponds closely with the 353@xmath0ghz  channel of the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) of planck .",
    "the central frequencies are almost identical , although the planck bandwidth will be considerably larger ( @xmath4 rather than the @xmath5 of the scuba 850@xmath3 m  filter ) .",
    "scuba has now been used to make several deep integrations which have detected distant sources at 850@xmath3m(barger et al .",
    "@xcite , eales et al .",
    "@xcite , holland et al .",
    "@xcite , hughes et al .",
    "@xcite , smail et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and this has radically altered our expectations for the importance of dusty galaxies at high redshift .",
    "a summary of the source count observations is provided in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "these new data thus provide us with direct measurements of the number density of bright sources ( albeit currently only over small patches of the sky , and a limited range of flux ) at a frequency directly relevant to the planck science channels .",
    "we shall work primarily at 353@xmath0ghz , though we shall also extrapolate these counts to nearby frequencies using models of the spectral energy distribution of the sources .",
    "there have been several estimates of how many sub - mm sources planck might be able to detect ( e.g.  bersanelli et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as estimates of other one - point statistics , often referred to as ` confusion noise ' ( condon  @xcite , blain et al .",
    "as far as the fluctuations are concerned , several studies have already been carried out on the implications of point sources for the measurement of cmb anisotropies .",
    "much of this work dealt more specifically with radio galaxy contributions at low frequency ( e.g. tegmark & efstathiou  @xcite ) , or dealt with far - ir sources , but concentrated on the uniform background contribution and the correlation function ( e.g.  franceschini et al .",
    "@xcite , bond et al .",
    "@xcite , wang  @xcite , gawiser & smoot  @xcite , blain et al .",
    "very similar studies have also been carried out for the x - ray background ( see yamamoto & sugiyama  @xcite , and references therein ) , the optical background ( see vogeley  @xcite , and references therein ) , and more exotic backgrounds ( e.g.  scott  @xcite ) .",
    "the most relevant work are the recent papers by toffolatti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and guiderdoni et al .  ( @xcite )",
    "which contain many useful results , and estimates of confusion noise , although they were written before the new series of scuba measurements .",
    "our approach here also differs from theirs in that our predictions are based on straightforward extrapolations from observable properties .",
    "we deliberately avoid any modelling of the complex galaxy evolution process .    to calculate the impact of these new data on planck",
    "it will be necessary to model the number density of sources as a function of flux , @xmath6 .",
    "we shall take care to ensure that our model does not overproduce , when integrated , the far - infrared background ( fib ) light detected by ( puget et al .",

    "some models show the counts to steepen even more at the bright end , but this has little effect on any results , since it is already steep enough that any upper flux cut is not very important .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] an estimate for the number of pixels over the whole sky at 353ghz , to indicate where we expect one source per pixel .",
    "we have assumed an oversampling by a factor of 10 pixels per beam as an illustrative number . with our adopted source counts model , planck",
    "will then have about one 20@xmath0mjy  source per beam ( which then sets the basic level of ` confusion noise ' ) .    in practice planck",
    "will only be able to detect individual sources with at best a flux cut of @xmath29@xmath0mjy using data from the 353@xmath0ghz  channel alone . with extra information from the higher frequency channels ( as well as information from other instruments , at least in some regions of the sky )",
    ", it should be possible to remove all sources down to a few@xmath30@xmath0mjy .",
    "the scuba counts constrain the model at somewhat lower flux levels than these , however in our model the counts at the scuba flux levels contribute significantly to the ir background and hence the cmb fluctuations if the sources are clustered ( see below ) . in any case the precise flux cut for planck is not currently easy to estimate , and",
    "so we have erred on the side of conservatism ; if the flux cut ends up being higher than we are assuming here , then the fluctuations will only be larger .    by describing the counts in this phenomenological way we avoid any direct modelling of galaxy formation , evolution and spectral synthesis .",
    "currently there are too many free parameters in these ` semi - analytic ' models to yield a great deal of insight .",
    "instead we prefer to use simple model fits to observables on the sky , which are motivated by the current data . because of this we are considering only the two - dimensional distribution of objects on the sky , with no requirement on the radial distribution .",
    "the contribution of these sources to the fib is just the total flux per unit solid angle , or @xmath31 which can be integrated by parts to yield @xmath32 ( a little care has to be taken with minus signs , since conventionally @xmath33 ) . the faint end limit for constant slope is just @xmath34 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fibscut ] the contribution to the integrated background light as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "notice that the sources at the flux levels probed by scuba contribute significantly to the background .",
    "as we will see below , it is those clustered sources which contribute most to the background that may be of greatest interest to us here . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fibalpha ] we show the contribution to the fib , integrating to @xmath35 , i.e.  the total background , as a function of the faint - end slope @xmath36 .",
    "the fib was first detected by puget et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and has recently been measured by fixsen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "their value is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fibscut ] , [ fig : fibalpha ] as the hatched region . in our fiducial model",
    "the sub - mm sources account for _ all _ of the fib .",
    "let us acknowledge that the real situation may be more complicated .",
    "the counts may come from a number of separate populations , and so of course there could be features in the actual curve .",
    "in addition there is the possibility that some more diffuse emission contributes to the fib , and is not accounted for in these counts .",
    "indeed there are some early indications ( hughes et al .  1998 , borys et al .",
    "1998 ) that the counts may be flatter at the faint end than the form we have adopted .",
    "again we have been conservative here ; lower faint - end slopes would require higher overall normalization in order to match the background , implying stronger fluctuations .",
    "we shall quote our results in ` temperature ' units as is usual in cmb anisotropy studies . for fluctuations about a mean ,",
    "the conversion factor from temperature to intensity ( or flux ) is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the planck function , @xmath39 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath40ghz is the ` dimensionless frequency ' and @xmath41 .",
    "if we assume that the number of sources of a given flux is independent of the number at a different flux , and if the angular two - point function of the point - sources is @xmath42 , then the angular power spectrum , @xmath43 , contributed by these sources is @xmath44 assuming that all sources with @xmath45 are removed . here , @xmath46 is the background contributed by sources below @xmath8 as before .",
    "following the conventional notation ( essentially introduced by peebles  @xcite ) , @xmath43 is the legendre transform of the correlation function @xmath47 produced by the sources and @xmath48 is the legendre transform of @xmath42 : @xmath49 with @xmath50 the legendre polynomial of order @xmath51 . the first term in equation  ( [ eqn : cltot ] ) is the usual poisson shot - noise term ( see peebles  @xcite  46 , or tegmark & efstathiou  @xcite ) , the second is due to clustering , assuming that the clustering is independent of flux .    integrating by parts",
    "the poisson term can be rewritten @xmath52 at low flux it becomes @xmath53 , if the counts have slope @xmath36 at the faint end .",
    "the shot - noise component of the angular power spectrum of our fiducial model is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cl ] , along with the primary cmb signal and the projected noise in the planck 353@xmath0ghz  channel .",
    "the poisson fluctuations are calculated using our fiducial model and assuming that we cut out all sources brighter than @xmath54@xmath0mjy .",
    "note that much of the fluctuation power comes from sources fainter than 50@xmath0mjy .",
    "the uncertainty in the normalization of these curves is directly proportional to our uncertainty in the counts , @xmath55 , which we have normalized to the data of table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "clearly @xmath55 is uncertain to at least a factor of 2 .",
    "however , increasing the normalization by this amount would overproduce the fib unless the faint end slope is also modified .    as",
    "an aside we mention that though the noise and poisson component of the sources appear to have similar power spectra , they are nonetheless quite different entities .",
    "the sources are on the sky , and thus contribute to the flux in every observation of that pixel , whereas the noise varies from observation to observation and by assumption is uncorrelated with the signal in the pixel observed . given many observations of a given direction on the sky ( as expected for planck ) , the noise properties can be separated from the sky signal , _ even if _ they have the same power spectra .",
    "the estimated instrumental noise can be subtracted from the measured power spectrum , with any point source contribution being evident as an extra @xmath56 component .",
    "we therefore expect that analysis of the planck data set will include fitting for an excess white noise component , which would be most likely due to unclustered point sources .",
    "we now turn to the other contribution to equation  ( [ eqn : cltot ] ) .",
    "unfortunately there is essentially no information about the clustering of the scuba sources at present .",
    "hence the most conservative assumption would be no clustering at all , but that is obviously unreasonable .",
    "hence , although we tried to be as conservative as possible when discussing the shot - noise power spectrum , for clustering we will just make some simple guess . if we approximate @xmath57 then @xmath58 . assuming either that the sources cluster like galaxies today or as lyman - break galaxies ( giavalisco et al .",
    "@xcite ) at @xmath1 , we would expect @xmath590.9 . as an illustrative example we can assume that the sources which make up much of the fib cluster like these lyman - break galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "we suspect that this may in fact be close to reality , since it is equivalent to assuming that the population is a highly biased one , collapsing early .",
    "on the other hand the scuba sources will span a wider redshift range than galaxies selected by the uv - dropout technique , thereby washing out the angular correlations to some extent .",
    "but , certainly the scuba - type sources are likely to be more highly clustered than iras galaxies at low redshift .",
    "our example can be probably considered an optimistic one in terms of clustered power .",
    "if the objects are less biased than the lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) by a factor of @xmath60 then one reduces @xmath48 , and hence the clustered contribution to @xmath43 , by @xmath61 .    with our assumption @xmath62 and @xmath63 on large angles",
    "@xmath42 is expected to drop below the power - law behaviour assumed in equation  ( [ eqn : wlly ] ) .",
    "the scale of non - linearity approximately marks this transition . if we assume the power spectrum is a power - law with index @xmath64 then @xmath65 .",
    "thus we expect that on larger angular scales @xmath48 will flatten and gradually turn over to @xmath66 . to take this into account we cause @xmath48 to become constant might not drop to low-@xmath51 , rather than go constant , but for @xmath67 the cmb signal dominates anyway , so our precise assumptions are not important .",
    "if we cause @xmath48 to approach @xmath51 immediately then the clustered signal is down from fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] by an order of magnitude at @xmath68 .",
    "thus we caution the reader that this simple model may overestimate the clustered signal at low-@xmath51 .",
    "a more complete treatment would require knowledge of the redshift distribution and the evolution of the clustering of the sources .",
    "] for @xmath67 , where we have chosen this multipole because it is a round number , and not because we think it has any physical significance .",
    "explicitly we approximate using @xmath69    we show the amplitude of the clustering signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] .",
    "note that the contribution due to source clustering dominates over the poisson term on the range of angular scales relevant to cmb anisotropies .",
    "in fact if the clustering proves to be this strong then planck may be able to measure the power spectrum of the ir sources over a range of angular scales .",
    "we imagine that such a component will be included as one of the foreground templates to be fitted for in a full planck analysis ",
    "the template would include frequency dependance , as well as a power spectrum which is white noise with perhaps one or two additional parameters to describe the clustering part .",
    "exactly how to model this component may change as we learn more from scuba and other instruments .",
    "further understanding of the clustering of these sources is clearly an important direction for future research .",
    "one other issue is the variance in these power spectra estimates . assuming that the point sources are a poisson sample , it is straightforward to estimate the cosmic variance associated with this component of the angular power spectrum . the variance is a sum of two terms , one due to the finite number of modes sampled by any given @xmath43 and the other from the poisson nature of the process .",
    "so we have @xmath70 the first term of equation  ( [ eqn : dcl ] ) is the usual result for gaussian fluctuations , the second term is the extra variance associated with the poisson sampling .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath71 of the sky is observed then the first term is increased by @xmath72 while the poisson term is unchanged . for",
    "now it seems safe to assume that the uncertainty in our modelling of the sources ( i.e.  the normalization and shape of @xmath73 ) is larger than the estimate of equation  ( [ eqn : dcl ] ) , so we can neglect the latter .",
    "we expect the intensity of these sources to decrease for wavelengths longward of @xmath2 m .",
    "assuming the flux decreases as @xmath74 , similar to the slope of the fib , we have calculated the contribution at the next lowest planck frequency : 217@xmath0ghz . as expected",
    "the contribution is considerably lower , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster220 ] .",
    "if we use information on the spectra of individual galaxies which have been detected by scuba , ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "1998 , hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) , then the derived slope may be steeper still , leading to lower 217@xmath0ghz  contributions . obviously at even lower frequencies , the signal will be correspondingly reduced .",
    "at the next higher frequency channel , 545@xmath0ghz , the sources are obviously brighter .",
    "we find that the poisson contribution with a 100@xmath0mjy  cut dominates the noise by more than 2 orders of magnitude over the range @xmath75 , with the clustered contribution potentially larger still .",
    "we have investigated the implications of the recent scuba number counts for the planck surveyor .",
    "since it observes at the same frequency as one of the main science channels on planck , scuba can provide constraints on the point - source contribution to the cmb angular power spectrum which require no extrapolation in frequency . while previous authors have investigated mainly one - point statistics of several scuba fields , it is the two - point function which has the most impact on the cmb science which will be done with planck .",
    "we have calculated the two - point function of point - sources , using a poisson model normalized to the observed counts . while the current data are uncertain , under reasonable assumptions the point - source contribution to the anisotropy is comparable to the instrumental noise in the 353@xmath0ghz  channel . we have emphasized that if the instrumental noise power spectrum can be accurately estimated ( as is expected to be the case for planck , since each pixel is observed multiple times ) , then even a white noise contribution from point sources could still be detected .",
    "the clustering of these sources is extremely uncertain , however if they cluster like the @xmath1 lyman - break galaxies their signal would be larger than the primary anisotropy signal on scales smaller than about 10 arcminutes .",
    "we expect the intensity of these sources to decrease for wavelengths longward of @xmath2 m . at the next lowest frequency channel , 217@xmath0ghz",
    ", the contribution from both the clustered and poisson terms is dramatically reduced .",
    "the bottom - line is that the sub - mm sources revealed by scuba will not have a strong impact on the most important goal of the planck mission , that of precisely characterising the cmb anisotropy . for the entire low frequency instrument , and the three lowest frequency channels of the hfi there will be no significant contribution . and",
    "certainly the signals in the higher frequency channels can be used to remove point sources and recover most of the cmb information even at 353@xmath0ghz . moreover ,",
    "the possibility of actually measuring the poisson and clustering signals over most of the sky for these galaxies provides planck with yet another way of tackling fundamental cosmological issues ."
