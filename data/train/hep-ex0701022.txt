    "flavor tagging is important in studies of neutral @xmath0 meson mixing and cp violation in the @xmath0 system . at hadron colliders , because of minimum bias events and multiple interactions per crossing , the background level is higher as compared to the more cleaner environment at @xmath4 colliders .",
    "also , at hadron colliders the @xmath3-jets may not always be well separated ( as in the case of @xmath5 ) , while at @xmath6 colliders , one gets well balanced and separated jets .",
    "therefore , in order to identify @xmath3-jets or decays one needs sophisticated techniques to achieve a good efficiency and purity of the tags . broadly speaking ,",
    "flavor tagging methods can be categorized into opposite side tagging ( ost ) and same side tagging ( sst ) @xcite . in the case of ost ,",
    "one uses the decay products of the opposite @xmath0 in the event , and since the @xmath0 mesons are produced in pairs in a @xmath7 event , the @xmath0 flavor of the tag side is ideally opposite to the @xmath0 flavor of the decay side ( the @xmath0 meson which is fully or partially reconstructed is referred to as the `` decay '' or `` reconstruction '' side @xmath0 meson ) .",
    "the tag side @xmath0 meson however could oscillate if it was neutral , independent of the reconstruction side @xmath0 meson and therefore in such a case the tag would incorrect .",
    "ost flavor taggers are sub - categorized into ( i ) lepton taggers , where one exploits the charge correlation of the lepton and the quark flavor in semileptonic @xmath3 decays , ( ii ) jet charge taggers , where one use the fact that the kinematically weighted charge of the @xmath3-jet is correlated with the charge of the @xmath3 , and ( iii ) opposite side kaon tagger ( oskt ) , where one exploits the correlation of the charge of the kaon with the @xmath0 flavor in the decay chain @xmath8 . in the case of sst , one utilizes the charge correlation of the fragmentation tracks produced on the same side as the `` reconstructed '' @xmath0 . for sst the wrong sign contribution due to the `` tag '' @xmath0 meson oscillating is absent , and it has a high efficiency , but it has a somewhat worse purity than the ost tagger , as it is difficult to identify the correct fragmentation track from a large number of decay product tracks .",
    "flavor taggers are optimized to obtain high efficiencies ( @xmath9 ) and purities , where @xmath9 is defined as the fraction of reconstructed events ( @xmath10 ) that are tagged ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 .",
    "the term dilution ( @xmath13 ) is more commonly used , which is related to the purity , @xmath14 , as @xmath15 and is defined as the normalized difference of correctly and wrongly tagged events : @xmath16 where , @xmath17 .",
    "the terms `` correctly '' and `` wrongly '' refer to the determination of the decay @xmath0 meson flavor .",
    "the effective tagging power of a tagging algorithm is given by @xmath18 and the goal is to maximize this quantity .",
    "leptons from @xmath0 decays have low momenta as compared to leptons from top or electroweak decays , and require special treatment to identify them .",
    "the complexity of lepton identification needed depends on the detector .",
    "the cdf detector has a muon coverage up - to @xmath19 and the d  detector has a muon coverage up - to @xmath20 in runii . at cdf , the central muon chamber ( cmu )",
    "is situated just outside the hadron calorimeter .",
    "hence , the fake rate from punchthroughs , and decay in flights ( dif s ) from kaons and pions decaying into muons , for the cmu muons is high .",
    "another layer of muon chambers was therefore installed further up , for the runii phase , which is acronymed as cmp .",
    "the rates of punch - through and dif s are studied in data .",
    "the central muon detectors at d  are proportional drift tubes ( pdt s ) located in the pseudo - rapidity range of @xmath21 and mini - drift tubes ( mdt s ) between @xmath22 .",
    "both the central and forward detectors consist of 3 layers , with the first layer just outside the hadron calorimeter and the other two layers lying outside the toroid .",
    "muons at d  have negligible punchthrough background after requiring that it passes the toroid .",
    "the cdf calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter consisting of layers of scintillators and lead .",
    "there is a position detector at shower maximum , at about 6 radiation lengths ( @xmath23 ) , which is composed of orthogonal strips and wires , and provides measurement in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 direction . besides this",
    ", a central pre - radiator at about 1 @xmath23 is useful as an additional layer for identifying electrons , especially low momentum electrons which can start showering much before the em calorimeter .",
    "this was a gas wire chamber in the runiia phase and is now replaced by scintillators in the runiib phase . the d  calorimeter is a primarily liquid - argon / uranium sampling calorimeter , covering up - to @xmath26 .",
    "the central preshower situated at @xmath27 1 @xmath23 , is made of three concentric cylindrical layers of triangular cross - section scintillator strips , with wavelength shifting fiber ( wls ) readout .",
    "more details on the cdf and d  detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "for identifying muons , cdf developed a muon likelihood function , to disentangle background coming from punchthroughs and dif s , which is especially problematic in the cmu .",
    "the muon i d variable probability density functions ( pdf s ) were developed from data , using signal muons from @xmath28 and fakes from @xmath29 and other modes .",

    "the standard electron reconstruction is based on calorimeter clusters , relying on the characteristic transverse and longitudinal shapes of electromagnetic showers and is usually designed for high @xmath30 electrons .",
    "the leptons in @xmath0 decays have low momenta and could be non - isolated and within the b - jet . for low @xmath30 electrons , in order to achieve a higher purity and to remove contamination from nearby tracks , one starts with the track and extrapolates it to the calorimeter and it suffices to use a fewer number of towers to form a narrower cluster . d  uses simple cuts on the electron i d quantities while cdf uses a likelihood variable . to optimize the cuts or to develop the likelihood",
    ", electrons from photon conversions @xmath31 as signal and @xmath32 are used for the fakes .",
    "electrons from photon conversions have a very similar @xmath30 spectrum as electrons from @xmath3-decays . the ratio of energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter to the momentum of the track for the d  experiment can be see in fig .",

    ", the invariant mass of the lepton and displaced track system @xmath33 is required to be consistent with a @xmath0 candidate , using the cut , @xmath34 gev .",
    "furthermore , true @xmath0 decays should have a positively displaced signed impact parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the impact parameter of the track .",
    "therefore , a background subtraction is done , and the sample with negative impact parameter is subtracted from the sample with positive signed impact parameter ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mlsvt ] ) .",
    "however , since this sample is inclusive of all @xmath0 decays , the trigger side can mix and undergo sequential decays and there are also fake leptons , which means that the sign of the lepton does not give the correct @xmath0 meson flavor at the decay side .",
    "thus , the `` true '' tagger dilution is given by the `` raw '' tagger dilution/trigger  side dilution .     the invariant mass distribution for @xmath38 sample with the negative impact parameter background component subtracted .",

    "tag leptons ( muon or electron ) with @xmath40 are searched for , on the opposite side using the soft lepton identification algorithms as described in section [ sec : lepid ] .",
    "only electrons in the range @xmath41 are used . the dilution is then parametrized as a function of the transverse momentum of the tag lepton w.r.t the tag lepton jet ( @xmath42 ) and the electron or muon likelihood cut , to provide an event - by - event dilution @xcite .",
    "the jet charge tag starts with forming track based jets .",
    "each of the tracks in the jet are assigned a `` b''-ness probability using a neural network , called a tracknet probability .",
    "some of the track properties used as inputs to the neural network are the impact parameter significance , the signed impact parameter , the transverse momentum , and others . to select the single best @xmath3-jet in the presence of multiple jets , the jets are fed to a neural network , and the jet with the highest nn probability ( @xmath43 )",
    "is chosen .",
    "the jet charge is calculated as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the nn probability for the track .",
