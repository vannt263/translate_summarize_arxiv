    "conventional wisdom holds that it is impossible to construct a finite field theory of quantum gravity .",
    "indeed , all widely accepted studies to date have concluded that all known gravity field theories are ultraviolet divergent and non - renormalizable  @xcite .",
    "if one were able to find a finite four - dimensional quantum field theory of gravity , it would have profound implications .",
    "in particular , finiteness would seem to imply that there should be an additional symmetry hidden in the theory .",
    "although power counting arguments indicate that all known gravity field theories are non - renormalizable , there are very few explicit calculations establishing their divergence properties . for pure gravity",
    ", a field redefinition removes the potential on - shell one - loop divergence  @xcite , but the calculation of goroff and sagnotti  @xcite , confirmed by van de ven  @xcite , explicitly shows that pure einstein gravity has an ultraviolet divergence at two loops .",
    "if generic matter fields are added  @xcite a divergence appears already at one loop .",
    "if the matter is added so as to make the theory supersymmetric , the divergences are in general delayed until at least three loops ( see e.g. refs .",
    "however , no complete calculations have been performed to confirm that the coefficients of the potential divergences in supersymmetric theories are actually non - vanishing .",
    "one approach to dealing with the calculational difficulties  @xcite makes use of the unitarity method  @xcite , as well as the kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt ) relations between open- and closed - string tree - level amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "in the low - energy limit the klt relations express gravity tree amplitudes in terms of gauge theory tree amplitudes  @xcite . combining the klt representation with the unitarity method , which builds loop amplitudes from tree amplitudes , massless gravity scattering amplitudes  including their ultraviolet divergences ",
    "are fully determined to any loop order starting from gauge theory tree amplitudes .",
    "in particular , for the case of @xmath0 supergravity , the entire perturbative expansion can be built from @xmath1 super - yang - mills tree amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "it is rather striking that one can obtain all the amplitudes of @xmath0 supergravity from the tree amplitudes of an ultraviolet - finite conformal field theory .",
    "the klt relations between gauge and gravity amplitudes are especially useful for addressing the question of the ultraviolet divergences of gravity theories because , from a technical viewpoint , perturbative computations in gauge theories are much simpler than in gravity theories . with the unitarity method ,",
    "these relations are promoted to relations on the unitarity cuts .",
    "this strategy has already been used  @xcite to argue that the first potential divergence in @xmath0 supergravity would occur at five loops , instead of the three loops previously predicted using superspace power counting arguments  @xcite . using harmonic superspace , howe and stelle have confirmed this result  @xcite .",
    "very interestingly , they also speculate that the potential divergences may be delayed an additional loop order .    in this note",
    "we reexamine the power counting of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "we demonstrate that there are additional unexpected cancellations beyond those identified in that paper .",
    "our analysis of the amplitudes is based on unitarity cuts which slice through three or more lines representing particles , instead of the iterated two - particle cuts focused on in ref .",
    "it suggests that @xmath0 supergravity may have the same ultraviolet behavior as @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory , _",
    "i.e. _ that it is finite in four dimensions . we will also outline calculations , feasible using the unitarity method , that should be done to shed further light on this issue .",
    "our motivation for carrying out this reexamination stems from the recent realization that in the @xmath0 theory unexpected one - loop cancellations first observed for the special class of maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes  @xcite , in fact hold more generally  @xcite .",
    "the potential consequences of these cancellations for the ultraviolet divergences at higher loops were noted in the latter references .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been known for a while that the one - loop mhv amplitudes with four , five and six external gravitons are composed entirely of scalar box integrals  @xcite , lacking all triangle and bubble integrals . although there are no complete calculations for more than six external legs , factorization arguments make a strong case that the same property holds for mhv amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external legs .",
    "factorization puts rather strong constraints on amplitudes and has even been used to determine their explicit form in some cases ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . because the scalar box integral functions are the same ones that appear in the corresponding @xmath1 super - yang - mills amplitudes ,",
    "the @xmath2-dimensional ultraviolet behavior is identical : the amplitudes all begin to diverge at @xmath5 .    as the number of external legs increases",
    ", one might have expected the ultraviolet properties of supergravity to become relatively worse compared to super - yang - mills theory , as a consequence of the two - derivative couplings of gravity . from recent explicit calculations of six and seven graviton amplitudes  @xcite , it is now clear that the cancellations which prevent triangle or bubble integrals from appearing extend beyond the mhv case .",
    "this property has been referred to as the `` no - triangle hypothesis '' .",
    "this hypothesis puts an upper bound on the number of loop momenta that can appear in the numerator of any one - loop integral . under integral reductions",
    "@xcite any power of loop momentum @xmath6 appearing in the numerator can be used to reduce an @xmath7-gon integral to an @xmath8-gon integral .",
    "the @xmath8-gon integral has one less power of @xmath6 in its numerator .",
    "inverse propagators ( such as @xmath9 ) present in the numerator are special : they can also be used to reduce @xmath7-gon integrals to @xmath8-gon integrals with _ two _ less powers of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , consider a pentagon integral with a factor of @xmath10 in the numerator , denoted by @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath12 are two propagators in the pentagon integral and @xmath13 is the momentum of an external line , we can rewrite the numerator factor as a difference of two inverse propagators , @xmath14 this equation immediately reduces the linear pentagon integral to a difference of two scalar box integrals , @xmath15   = i_4^{(1 ) } - i_4^{(2)}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the box integrals obtained from the pentagon by removing the @xmath9 and @xmath12 propagators , respectively . more generally , integral reductions bound the maximum power of loop momenta in the numerator , in order that triangle integrals not appear in the final result . for a pentagon integral",
    "the maximum is one inverse propagator , or one generic power of @xmath6 ; for a hexagon it is two inverse propagators , or two generic powers of @xmath6 ; and so forth .    for six - graviton non - mhv amplitudes , the computations of ref .",
    "@xcite constitute a proof of the no - triangle hypothesis . for seven gravitons",
    "they demonstrate that the box integrals correctly account for infrared divergences , making it unlikely for infrared - divergent triangle integrals to appear . for larger numbers of external gravitons , the same factorization arguments used for mhv amplitudes  @xcite make a strong case that the required cancellations continue to hold for all graviton helicity configurations .",
    "supersymmetry relations suggest that the no - triangle hypothesis should be extendable from graviton amplitudes to amplitudes for all possible external states , because all @xmath0 supergravity states belong to the same supermultiplet .",
    "the additional cancellations implied by the no - triangle hypothesis are rather non - trivial .",
    "for example , one - loop integrands constructed using the klt representation of tree amplitudes naively violate the no - triangle bound  @xcite . in the rest of this letter",
    "we will assume that the no - triangle hypothesis holds for all one - loop @xmath0 amplitudes and examine the consequences for higher loops .",
    "will these unexpected one - loop cancellations continue to higher orders ? using conventional feynman diagram techniques , it is not at all clear how to extract from these one - loop on - shell cancellations useful higher - loop statements , given that the formalism is inherently off shell .",
    "the unitarity method  @xcite , however , provides a means for doing so .",
    "because of the direct way that lower - loop on - shell amplitudes are used to construct the higher - loop ones , it is clear that the one - loop cancellations will continue to be found in higher - loop amplitudes .",
    "the main question then is whether the cancellations are sufficient to imply finiteness of the theory to all loop orders .    besides the implications of the no - triangle hypothesis for higher loops via unitarity",
    ", there are a number of other clues pointing to a better than expected ultraviolet behavior .",
    "one interesting clue comes from the fact that the only complete @xmath0 calculation at two loops  the four - graviton amplitude  has exactly the same power counting as the corresponding @xmath1 super - yang - mills amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this example clearly shows that a common degree of finiteness between the two theories in @xmath2 dimensions is not limited to one loop .",
    "an indirect hint of additional cancellations at higher loops comes from @xmath18 theory dualities . in refs .",
    "@xcite , by using duality ( defined in an appropriate way in the low - energy limit using eleven - dimensional supergravity with counterterms and a particular string - inspired regulator ) , it was argued that in type  ii string theory the @xmath19 term in the effective action does not suffer from renormalization beyond two loops . because @xmath20 supergravity may be obtained from type  ii supergravity through compactification of six of the dimensions , it hints that the former theory may also have additional cancellations .",
    "a very recent paper from green , russo and vanhove uses restrictions from @xmath18 and string theory dualities to argue that @xmath0 supergravity is no worse than logarithmically divergent in the ultraviolet  @xcite .",
    "( a related analysis of the four - graviton ten- , twelve- and fourteen - derivative terms has also just appeared  @xcite . ) statements linking string dualities to improved ultraviolet behavior , and perhaps ultraviolet finiteness , in @xmath0 supergravity may also be found in an earlier paper by chalmers  @xcite .",
    "an important new clue for the existence of improved ultraviolet behavior in @xmath0 supergravity comes from the recent work of berkovits on the multi - loop effective action of type ii string theories  @xcite . by analyzing string theory amplitudes",
    ", berkovits found that @xmath21 terms in the effective action do not receive perturbative contributions from above @xmath22 loops for @xmath23 , because more than @xmath24 powers of external momenta come out of the string integrand . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes an @xmath0 supersymmetric contraction of riemann tensors  @xcite , and @xmath26 denotes a generic spacetime derivative . assuming that there are no cancellations between the massless and higher - mass states of the string in the loops for small external momenta , the string amplitude properties can be applied to supergravity amplitudes , providing an indication of additional cancellations in ten - dimensional type  ii supergravity .",
    "if true , then the fact that type  ii supergravity corresponds to @xmath0 supergravity oxidized to ten dimensions would indicate the existence of additional cancellations in four dimensions , beyond those of refs .",
    "@xcite , supporting the speculation of howe and stelle .",
    "finally , the new twistor structure uncovered for gravity theories  @xcite implies a rich set of constraints on the form of gravity amplitudes . if @xmath0 supergravity loop amplitudes could be obtained from a topological string theory , it might lead to a natural explanation for ultraviolet finiteness .",
    "recent developments in constructing a topological twistor string for gravity theories may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all these indirect results point to the need to reinvestigate the ultraviolet properties of the @xmath0 theory directly .",
    "a first complete test would be to compute the full three - loop four - graviton amplitude , in order to confirm that 14 powers of external momentum do in fact come out of the @xmath0 loop momentum integrals .",
    "here we shall perform a preliminary examination , studying types of cancellations occurring in three- and higher - loop amplitudes .",
    "the unitarity method offers a powerful way to determine ultraviolet properties of gravity theories . the higher - loop study in ref .",
    "@xcite relied on using two - particle cuts .",
    "because of a remarkable recycling property , it is possible to iterate the two - particle cuts to _ all _ loop orders .",
    "although two - particle iteration provides a wealth of information on the structure of the amplitudes , it is only for a limited set of contributions .",
    "based on the contributions to the iterated two - particle cuts , as well as an observed `` squaring '' structure compared to the super - yang - mills case , the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the @xmath0 supergravity amplitudes should be ultraviolet finite for @xmath27 where @xmath2 is the dimension and @xmath28 the loop order .",
    "( the case of one - loop , @xmath29 , is special and the amplitudes are ultraviolet finite for @xmath30 , not @xmath31 . )",
    "this formula implies that in @xmath32 the first potential divergence is at five loops .",
    "this result was confirmed by studying all cuts , but restricted to mhv helicity configurations crossing the cuts .",
    "it is also in agreement with the more recent harmonic superspace analysis of howe and stelle  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the finiteness condition for @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory , found in refs .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath33 ( for @xmath29 , again the amplitudes are finite for @xmath30 . )",
    "the bound in differs somewhat from the earlier superspace power counting bound  @xcite , though all bounds confirm that @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory is ultraviolet finite in @xmath32 . in the planar limit",
    "the complete expressions for the @xmath1 super - yang - mills amplitudes are known through four loops  @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated all logarithmic singularities of the planar contributions in the critical dimensions @xmath34 corresponding to two , three and four loops , directly confirming , at least in the limit of a large number of colors . for the @xmath0 supergravity case",
    "there are no complete calculations beyond two loops , so the finiteness condition ( [ oldpowercount ] ) is much less certain .",
    "2.5 truein    a key assumption behind the finiteness condition  ( [ oldpowercount ] ) is that there are no cancellations with terms not present in iterated two - particle cuts .",
    "as discussed above , there are good reasons to reexamine this assumption .",
    "3 truein    to do so , consider an @xmath0 supergravity contribution from the iterated two - particle cuts used in the power count of ref .",

    "an examination of the three - particle cuts confirms  @xcite that the correct numerator factor is @xmath45 , instead of , for example @xmath46 which is equivalent using the on - shell conditions of the iterated two - particle cut in ( a ) .",
    "no analogous check has been performed on the @xmath0 amplitudes . for the supergravity case , we can rewrite the prefactor in front of the integral directly in terms of the supergravity tree amplitude , using the klt - like relation @xmath47 ^ 2 = st ( s+t ) m_4^\\tree(1,2,3,4 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the @xmath0 four - point tree amplitude .",

    "it is important to note that replacing @xmath52 ^ 2 $ ] with @xmath53 also leads , under integral reduction , to a violation of the no - triangle hypothesis , although it has a better ultraviolet behavior .",
    "we may compare this power counting to the results from an evaluation of the three - particle cuts . on the left - hand side of the cut in ( b ) , the one - loop five - point supergravity amplitude is given by  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 are color - ordered five - point super - yang - mills tree amplitudes and @xmath56 , etc .",
    "in we have dropped the contributions that vanish away from four - dimensions , since they are suppressed by a power of @xmath57 and should be irrelevant as far as the leading ultraviolet behavior near @xmath32 is concerned . at five points",
    "all amplitudes are mhv , and there are simple supersymmetric ward identities  @xcite relating the various five - point amplitudes involving the superpartners ; these are described in appendix e of ref .",
    "the appearance of exactly four propagators in each term in implies that pentagon integrals have canceled down to boxes , but with no triangle integrals present .",
    "alternatively , instead of carrying out the integration one can use the merging procedure on the cut integrands discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite to algebraically arrive at the same conclusion .",
    "the coefficients of these box integrals may also be readily obtained using an observation due to britto , cachazo and feng that the quadruple cuts freeze box integral loop momenta , allowing for their simple algebraic determination  @xcite .",
    "the lack of triangle integrals involves a rather non - trivial set of cancellations : the permutation sum is over 30 contributions corresponding to the distinct scalar box integrals with one external massive leg .    comparing",
    "to we see that the one - loop amplitude entering the cut is much better behaved in the ultraviolet than is implied by the result ( [ iteratedintegrand ] ) .",
    "because violates the no - triangle hypothesis , which we know is correct at five points  @xcite , some of the powers of loop momenta must cancel .",
    "however , this cancellation is not visible in the contribution  ( [ iteratedintegrand ] ) .",
    "a crucial difference between the iterated two - particle cut depicted in ( a ) and the three - particle cut depicted in ( b ) is that the latter includes also a variety of other diagrammatic topologies .",

    "in @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory , cancellations between planar and non - planar topologies can not happen , because planar and non - planar contributions carry different color factors and can therefore be treated independently .",

    "this proposed @xmath0 numerator factor is at the origin of the power count  ( [ oldpowercount ] ) .",
    "however , this factor leads to a violation of the no - triangle hypothesis for the @xmath59-leg amplitude on the left - hand side of the @xmath28-particle cut in ( a ) .",
    "that is , we find that the cancellations which reduce the one - loop amplitude to a sum over box integrals have not been taken into account . since there is strong evidence in favor of the one - loop no - triangle hypothesis  @xcite , we conclude that the finiteness condition ( [ oldpowercount ] ) is probably too conservative .",
    "truein    one can also extend this analysis using generalized unitarity , which provides a powerful way to construct amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "for all possible one - loop sub - amplitudes isolated by cutting internal lines in a higher - loop amplitude , as depicted in ( b ) , the no - triangle hypothesis implies that they have the same degree of divergence as the @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory . because this result holds for all possible generalized cuts which isolate a one - loop amplitude , we obtain a rather non - trivial set of consistency conditions limiting the ultraviolet behavior of the higher - loop amplitudes .",
    "if a specific set of cuts points to bad ultraviolet behavior in a given loop momentum , we can isolate that loop via generalized unitarity .",
    "every such one - loop subamplitude has a power count no worse than that of @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory ( assuming the no - triangle hypothesis ) , suggesting that the entire amplitude may have this property .",
    "1.1 truein    in order to construct a proof that the overall degree of divergence matches that of @xmath1 super - yang - mills , it is crucial to track the critical dimension where logarithmic divergences first arise . in such a proof one would need to rule out contributions where the no - triangle hypothesis is not violated , yet the overall finiteness bound ( [ superyangmillspowercount ] ) is violated .",
