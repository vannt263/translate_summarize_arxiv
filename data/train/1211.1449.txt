    "various problems of practical interest involve the task of estimating the state of the system of interest under under the presence of a number of sensors .",
    "for example , a sensor fusion problem involves determining an optimal way to combine the measurements from multiple sensors each of which may measure a subset of the states of the system .",
    "this is , in essence , a state estimation problem .",
    "a more involved problem arises when the state estimation strategy is given the freedom to dynamically select the set of sensors used .",
    "such a sensor scheduling problem can be used to model scenarios encompassing robust estimation under potential sensor faults ; in addition this framework may be used to preselect a set of sensors to be used , based on constraints on the available communication bandwidth or energy limitations on transmitting sensed information .    in the domain of optimal state estimation",
    ", there are two distinct approaches to estimation / filter design which have been applied in the design of estimators for systems subjected to process and measurement noise . the most well known approach to filter design",
    "is the kalman filter developed for linear systems in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "the kalman filter uses the statistics of the noise / measurement processes in order to compute the weightings on the measurement error , used to update the state estimate , as new measurements are observed .",
    "an alternative approach is the minimum energy filtering technique developed by mortensen @xcite .",
    "this interpretation views the optimal state estimation problem as an optimal control problem wherein the objective is to minimize the energy of the noise process required to explain the observations .",
    "the resulting filter obtained via both these approaches _ for the linear system case with white noise processes _ ( and a quadratic energy function with @xmath0 noise processes ) turns out to be the kalman filter @xcite .    the articles @xcite address the sensor scheduling problem in the case of linear systems with gaussian input noise .",
    "an alternative approach for optimal sensor scheduling in nonlinear systems , formulated via imposing a cost on the switching of sensor choice and the error in estimation due to this choice , was undertaken in @xcite .",
    "the solution for this case depends on the solution of a riccati differential equation arising from the choice of sensors , and can be solved offline .",
    "generalized versions of this problem for the case of uncertain systems with linear ( albeit time varying ) dynamics using integral quadratic constraints to model the uncertainty of the system were studied in @xcite .",
    "the latter uses a deterministic filtering interpretation of the estimator ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this article",
    "we study an approach to solving problems of sensor scheduling for systems with linear dynamics which involves solving a modified version of the deterministic filtering problem .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sysandprobdescription ] we formulate the estimation problem as an associated optimal control problem which may be solved via dynamic programming .",
    "hence , the methods employed herein generalize deterministic filtering to deal with sensor selection strategies . in sec .",
    "[ minplusandstructpres ] we describe how the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation may be solved using a new class of computational approaches to solving such partial differential equations .",
    "the underlying idea involves modeling the value function as an element of a semi - convex function space whose structure is preserved under the dynamic programming operator .",
    "such a technique belongs to a class of recently developed methods termed max - plus methods which have led to intriguing advancements in computational tractability for optimal control problems in several domains @xcite .",
    "the techniques introduced herein can be extended to certain classes of nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear output functions as well @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ example ] we demonstrate the application of the theory developed , using an example system with five sensors .",
    "we then conclude with a description of problems of interest and avenues for further exploration in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in this article we consider the class of systems with discrete time dynamics of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the system state at a time instant @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a disturbance signal .",
    "the output equation for the system with @xmath5 sensors is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is measurement noise in the @xmath8 th sensor at time step @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath5 sensors above are such that the pairs @xmath9 are observable for each @xmath8 .    in the results to be presented in this article ,",
    "we make use of a time reversed representation of the dynamics rather than the time incremental version in .",
    "this time - inverted system has the model @xmath10 and we denote the solution to this dynamics at any time step @xmath3 given the state at a different time instant @xmath8 , a control signal @xmath11 and a disturbance @xmath12 as @xmath13 for this @xmath5 sensor system we pose the dynamic sensor selection problem as a modification of the deterministic filtering problem as follows .",
    "we commence by modeling the choice of sensors at each time step as an element @xmath14 of the unit ball @xmath15 .",
    "specifically , if only one sensor say the @xmath16 th sensor ) is chosen , then the vector @xmath14 is an @xmath5 dimensional vector with @xmath17 at the @xmath16-th element and @xmath18 at the others .",
    "hence @xmath14 has a probabilistic interpretation in terms of the relative belief in each sensors accuracy .    for any particular disturbance signal realization and the control signal @xmath19 for the choice of sensor , we consider a cost function of the form @xmath20 with weighting matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 on the measurement error and state estimation error respectively . here",
    "@xmath23 is the assumed value of the initial state of the system and @xmath24 is the estimated state of the system at time @xmath3 under the dynamics .",
    "hence , the cost function penalizes the disturbance , deviations from the system dynamics ( in terms of the deviation in the initial states and the measurement error ) .",
    "this form of the cost function differs from the standard form of the robust ( deterministic ) filter @xcite in the following manner . here",
    "the choice of the sensors is incorporated into the cost of using the final term in .",
    "note that the choice @xmath25 of sensor beliefs is allowed to vary at each time step .",
    "we may also penalize changes in the choice of sensors as was done in @xcite or study a one time step finite horizon control problem as in @xcite .",
    "the optimal cost function for this problem is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the piecewise continuous signals taking up values in @xmath15 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the value function at any time @xmath3 leads directly to the optimal state estimate via the relation @xmath30    now , we apply the dynamic programming principle from optimal control theory to obtain @xmath31 this equation , can be cast in the form of an operator @xmath32 acting on the value function as follows : @xmath33(x ) . \\label{\\eqnname dpoperatordef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    standard approaches to solve for the optimal cost function ( value function ) involve the solution of the associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman partial differential equation which is the infinitesimal limit of the above equation .",
    "however , this leads to issues of large computational complexity , especially in cases with nonlinear dynamics and a higher number of dimensions of the state space . in this work",
    ", we apply a technique which has shown much promise in enabling the solution to certain classes of optimal control/ optimal filtering problems @xcite  for both linear and nonlinear systems .",
    "this approach makes use of the fact that the dynamic programming operator , above , is linear on the space of semi - convex functions .",
    "thus if we prove that the structure of the value function is preserved under the dynamic programming operator and the parameterization can be done independent of the state space ( i.e. the parameters of the value function do not depend on the point in space at which the value function is evaluated ) , then we can obtain a numerically efficient technique to solve optimal control problems which can be cast into this form by repeated applications of the dynamic programming operator ( while storing only the parameter values ) .",
    "further background details and specific applications of this concept to various problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that under one time step of propagation by the dynamic programming operator ( as in ) a specific form of the value function is preserved .",
    "as indicated previously , this feature leads to an efficient approach to solve for the value function ( and hence , to the state estimate ) .",
    "the value function thus determined may be used to obtain the optimal state estimate .",
    "we start with a description of the solution technique for the cost function      motivated by the terminal form of the value function @xmath34 we assume that the value function at any time step @xmath3 can be written as follows @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the index set at the time instant @xmath3 and the notation @xmath37 denotes the minimization operation over the index set .",
    "we assume that the quadratics associated with the index set are convex , leading to a well defined state estimate .",
    "given the form of the value function at time @xmath3 , the propagation under the dynamic programming operator leads to a preservation in structure of the value function viz .",
    "there exists a set @xmath38 and spatially invariant parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , for @xmath42 such that the value function at time @xmath43 is @xmath44    assuming the form of the value function in , we note that the action of the propagation equation leads to following recursion @xmath45 using the form of the value function in we have @xmath46 we note that for each @xmath8 , since @xmath12 and @xmath47 are independent , therefore the optimal value of @xmath14 can be determined from the last term in .",
    "specifically the optimal value of a linear function of @xmath14 on a compact set is given by a point on the boundary of the compact set .",
    "this leads to one of the sensors being used in one time step with the others being turned off ( in the case where the sensor dynamics can be altered at each time step ) .",
    "the optimal argument @xmath48 has one element @xmath49 equal to @xmath17 with all other elements of @xmath14 set to @xmath18 , where @xmath50 for simplicity of notation we denote @xmath51 note that for ever value of the state @xmath52 , the value of @xmath12 which minimizes the quadratic portion of the cost function dependent on @xmath12 can be obtained analytically as follows . for a triple @xmath53 , the corresponding @xmath54 which minimizes the term @xmath55 in the value function ,",
    "can be shown to have the analytic form @xmath56.\\label{\\eqnname proofofformpres2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , for every @xmath57 , there exists a disturbance value @xmath54 which can be optimally chosen to minimize the quadratic form ( in @xmath12 ) in the cost function . substituting this value of @xmath54 in and using ,",
    "we obtain a quadratic form in @xmath52 which can be written as @xmath58 where from , and it can be seen that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are obtained from the coefficients of quadratic terms in @xmath52 in and using the term @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 respectively . thus using and",
    "the value iteration in simplifies to @xmath65 creating a new index set @xmath66 and combining coefficients of equal powers of @xmath52 , we can rewrite as @xmath67 where it can be seen that @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath59 and terms from a subset of the @xmath68 .",
    "this completes the proof of the desired result .",
    "we now indicate how the value function obtained above is used to compute the optimal state estimate . starting with the terminal cost ,",
    "we apply the propagation procedure for @xmath69 time steps ( i.e. , for the entire duration of the estimation process ) to obtain a value function of the form @xmath70 the optimal state estimate at time step @xmath69 is defined as @xmath71 now given , and an unconstrained state space , we can solve for the state estimate by determining the minimum for each quadratic in the basis expansion . thus @xmath72 where @xmath73^{-1 }   r^\\gamma_b , \\quad \\forall \\gamma \\in   \\gamma_{n}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the set @xmath74 can be seen to be the set of the minima of the set of convex quadratic functions in the expansion .",
    "in this section we validate the theory developed thus far in this article , using an example problem as follows .",
    "we consider a first order linear system with forward time dynamics @xmath75 without loss of generality , the value of @xmath76 has been chosen in order to ensure the form of the backward dynamics in i.e. , the coefficient of the disturbance term becomes @xmath17 .",
    "we assume the presence of five sensors with linear output maps @xmath77 where the @xmath68 belong to the set @xmath78 ( under nominal conditions ) . in order to apply the formulation of the filter in sec .",
    "[ minplusandstructpres ] to this example , we assume weighting matrices @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "we apply the max - plus deterministic filter to this example system using a filter horizon of @xmath81 time steps . assuming the case of a systemic failure of all but one of the sensors - i.e. the set of @xmath68 becomes @xmath82",
    ", we obtain the results indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the case of no errors in the initial state assumption and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the case of an initial state error ( in the estimate ) .",
    "+     +    thus it is seen that the estimation mechanism solves the sensor selection problem in a robust manner .",
    "the algorithm uses the sensor which provides measurement signals which are used to minimize the cost function ( which thereby yields a state estimate ) .",
    "it can be seen that the approach recovers the state despite noisy measurements and sensor failures .",
    "a salient feature of the behavior of the estimation approach is that in both scenarios studied in the example ( zero / non - zero initial estimation error ) , when the noise in the functioning sensor increases rapidly over a short time duration , the algorithm temporarily switches to a different sensor which yields a lower cost function .",
    "once the functioning sensor yields a better performance , it is once again used for estimation as expected .",
    "in this article we introduced the application of the deterministic filtering concept to sensor selection for robust state estimation .",
    "the resulting optimal control problem yielded a hjb equation which was solved via the max - plus approach which utilizes the linearity of the dynamic programming propagator in order to obtain an efficient method to solve the hjb equation at each time step .",
    "the technique yielded promising results when applied to the case of drastic sensor failures for a linear system .",
    "some fruitful directions along which further research into this topic may be directed are : the extension of these methods to solve the sensor scheduling problem for nonlinear systems , to understand the behavior of the approach during short duration failures in sensors , the case of unmodeled system dynamics , incorporation of prior belief regarding sensor failure rates into the algorithm , the fusion of information from multiple sensors when not all of them satisfy the observability condition , the case where switching costs are imposed on changes in the sensor vector etc .",
    "one other facet of this approach to sensor scheduling is that it benefits from a non - zero input signal @xmath83 .",
    "thus it is useful to understand the requirement for persist excitation like conditions on the input to the system , in order to ensure robust state estimation .",
