    "for more then 15 years , diverse deformed models of quantum oscillator play the important role in the study of modern quantum mechanical systems , see e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "diverse ( @xmath1- ,  @xmath0- , etc . ) deformed oscillators , due to modified defining relations , can acquire nontrivial and unusual properties essentially different from those of the standard quantum oscillator . in ref .",
    "3 , general function - dependent deformations named the @xmath10-oscillators have been studied including nonlinear coherent states and other physical aspects .",
    "also , a unified framework for deformed single - mode oscillators has been presented in ref .",
    "4 . recently , it has been demonstrated@xcite that the two - parameter deformed @xmath0-oscillators introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite exhibit , at appropriate values of the deformation parameters @xmath1 and @xmath11 , the unusual property of so - called `` accidental '' double ( pairwise ) degeneracy , within a fixed pair of energy levels .",
    "such a pair may be of the type @xmath12 , of the type @xmath13 ,  @xmath14 , or even of more general type @xmath15 , for appropriate ( completely determined ) set of pairs of real values @xmath16 such that both @xmath1 and @xmath11 depend on @xmath17 .",
    "note that this result extends to the two - parameter case the completely analogous property ( revealed earlier@xcite and valid for definite _ real _ values of the @xmath1-parameter ) which is characteristic for the rather special @xmath1-deformed oscillator , the so - called tamm - dancoff ( td ) cutoff oscillator , which first appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the just mentioned degeneracy property , peculiar for the td - oscillator , can not occur in principle , with real @xmath1 , for the energy levels of the two most popular versions of @xmath1-deformed oscillator , namely the biedenharn - macfarlane@xcite ( bm ) @xmath1-oscillator and arik - coon@xcite ( ac ) version of @xmath1-deformed oscillators - oscillator when @xmath1 is taken as a root of unity , see e.g. , refs .",

    "our goal in this paper is to demonstrate that , among _ one - parameter deformed _",
    "@xmath1-oscillator models , the td @xmath1-oscillator is not the unique and exotic one which possesses _ at real values _ of deformation parameter @xmath1 the above mentioned property of accidental double ( or pairwise ) degeneracy in a fixed pair of energy levels . just the contrary : we show there exist infinitely many models of @xmath1-deformed oscillators ( constituting in fact functionally different continual sets or classes ) all of which share the degeneracy properties analogous to those mentioned above .",
    "the td @xmath1-oscillator is but a simplest individual case lying in one of such classes .",
    "few words about the plan of the paper . in sec .",
    "2 we recapitulate very shortly the basic setup concerning the @xmath9-deformed oscillators , as well as the main facts about two - fold ( pairwise ) degeneracy among their energy levels . in the next , 3rd section",
    "we construct many classes of one - parameter deformed @xmath1-oscillators which necessarily possess pairwise energy level degeneracy . in sec .",
    "4 we comment on a possible physical applications of the new @xmath1-oscillators .",
    "concluding remarks are contained in the last section .",
    "our basic system is the two - parameter deformed @xmath9-oscillator algebra@xcite whose generating elements @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 obey @xmath21 plus two more relations , involving @xmath22 ( or @xmath19 ) and @xmath23 , similar to non - deformed case .    the pair of relations in ( 1 ) , obviously symmetric under @xmath24 , is satisfied with @xmath25\\!]_{q , p } \\ , \\qquad   \\qquad a a^\\dagger = [ \\![{\\cal n}+1]\\!]_{q , p } \\ ,                     \\quad \\quad\\ ] ] where the @xmath9-bracket means @xmath26\\!]_{q , p } \\equiv \\frac { q^{x}-p^{x } } { q - p } \\\\ ] ] for @xmath27 either an operator or a real number . note that for a non - negative integer @xmath28 the @xmath0-bracket in ( 3 ) reduces to the ( symmetric , homogeneous ) @xmath9-polynomial : @xmath29\\!]_{q , p } = \\frac { q^{k}-p^{k } } { q - p } = \\sum_{r=0}^{k-1 } q^{k-1-r}p^r = q^{k-1}\\sum_{r=0}^{k-1}q^{-r } p^r \\ .\\ ] ] at @xmath30 this two - parameter system reduces to the ac - type@xcite @xmath1-oscillator , and putting @xmath31 yields the other distinguished case@xcite well known as the @xmath1-oscillator of biedenharn and macfarlane ( or bm ) .",
    "finally , at @xmath32 the relations ( 1)-(4 ) turn into those of the td oscillator whose unusual properties were studied in ref . @xcite .    for the hamiltonian taken in the form",
    "@xmath33 the energy spectrum @xmath34 in the @xmath0-deformed fock space basis reads : @xmath35\\!]_{q , p }   +   [ \\![n]\\!]_{q , p } \\bigr ) .\\ ] ] with the account of ( 4 ) , the energy spectrum takes the form @xmath36 as @xmath37 , we recover the familiar@xmath38 .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 for any @xmath9 .",
    "we will consider the @xmath9-oscillators at real @xmath1 , @xmath11 that belong to the intervals @xmath40 these define the quadrant in @xmath9-plane from which we exclude the point ( 0,0 ) .",
    "for the purposes of the present letter , of basic importance is the possibility of accidental degeneracies of @xmath0-oscillators , obeying the relations ( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "let us first recapitulate the statements from ref .",
    "@xcite that will be needed in the sequel .",
    "_ proposition 1 .",
    "_ there exists a continuum of pairs of values ( @xmath42 ) , or continuum of points of definite curve @xmath43 , which provide the degeneracy @xmath44    the degeneracy curve in @xmath45-plane , got from ( 9 ) and ( 7 ) , namely @xmath46 implies certain implicit function @xmath47 on the @xmath1-interval in ( 8) , continuous and monotonically decreasing .",
    "the latter can be shown@xcite through the derivative @xmath48 that is always negative .",
    "this continuous decreasing implicit function @xmath49 is represented by the curve ( 10 ) , with endpoints on the axes , in the quadrant ( 8) .",
    "_ remark 1 .",
    "_ the values of @xmath1 and @xmath11 from the pairs @xmath16 which solve eq .",
    "( 10 ) , in fact belong to the smaller , than in ( 8) , intervals @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( here @xmath52 resp . @xmath53 solve ( 10 ) for @xmath54 resp .",
    "@xmath55 , and are such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) . moreover , denoting @xmath58 ( since @xmath59 ) we have @xmath60    consider for a fixed @xmath5 ,  @xmath61 , the derivative @xmath62 at the endpoints @xmath63 ,  @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and at the midpoint ( given by @xmath32 ) of each curve @xmath49 .",
    "for any @xmath5 we have @xmath66 at the midpoint , while at the endpoints the derivative depends on @xmath5 , is negative , and such that @xmath67    in figure 1 , we illustrate the cases of @xmath68 by the curves 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .    ( the case given by the curve 1 in fig .",
    "1 ) the degeneracy implies @xmath69 which yields the ( explicit in this case ) function @xmath70 monotonically decreasing for @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "then , @xmath74      now consider the case with pairs of energy levels which are nearest neighbors .    for each @xmath76 ,   @xmath77 , there exists a continuum of pairs of values @xmath16 , or continuum of points of definite curve @xmath78 in the @xmath16-plane , for which the degeneracy @xmath79 does hold@xcite .",
    "the curve is given as @xmath80 eq .",
    "( 14 ) , due to polynomial form of its l.h.s . , determines a _ continuous _ implicit function @xmath81 .",
    "this function monotonically decreases on the @xmath1-interval in ( 8) as follows from the inequality @xmath82 indeed , the both partial derivatives ( being polynomials ) are continuous and positive functions of two variables . e.g. , in the case of due to eq .  ( 14 ) we have @xmath83 from which we deduce that the inequality @xmath84 is valid _ at each point of the curve_. for more details concerning the proof that @xmath85 is continuous , monotonically decreasing implicit function see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the cases @xmath86 of @xmath87 are shown in fig .  1 as the curves 5,6,7 .    [ hbtp ]    _ remark 2 . _",
    "the case @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) obviously differs from the rest @xmath61 cases since in the endpoints @xmath90 and @xmath91 the derivative @xmath92 acquires the values distinct from those in @xmath93 cases . indeed , at @xmath88 , @xmath94 and @xmath95  ( i.e. , the derivative @xmath96 continuously drops from @xmath97 to @xmath98 as @xmath1 runs from zero to one ) .",
    "in contrast , for each @xmath61 we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath92 decreases from @xmath101 to @xmath102 as @xmath1 grows from zero to one .",
    "the distinction of @xmath103 case from the rest @xmath61 cases , e.g. , @xmath104 or @xmath105 , is evident in fig .  1 ( the curve 5 versus the curves 6 and 7 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath0-deformed oscillators we have the property of double degeneracy ( within a fixed pair ) of energy levels . due to this fact , a possibility arises to obtain a host of one - parameter @xmath1-deformed oscillators all inheriting , like the td - oscillator studied in ref .",

    "@xcite for the td case ) acquires the property of double degeneracy at certain @xmath1 , within a pair of energy levels .",
    "this fact follows immediately since , in the ( @xmath9)-plane , each line @xmath106 with @xmath108 fixed so that @xmath114 , crosses just once the @xmath0-curve @xmath115 of the corresponding degeneracy .    [ hbtp ]    in fig .  2 ,",
    "the representatives of all three subclasses are shown , including the @xmath113 ( or the td ) case .",
    "any representative of each subclass ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) does intersect exactly once with each of the degeneracy curves @xmath115 at certain value of @xmath1 . as a consequence of the symmetry @xmath116 , the first and the second subclasses are dual ( or inverse ) to each other .    _ @xmath1-oscillators deduced by setting @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and those deduced by setting @xmath119 ,  @xmath118 . _",
    "the next two classes of @xmath1-deformed oscillators arise from @xmath9-oscillators if we impose logarithmic or exponential type of relation @xmath120 .",
    "let us first put @xmath121 then we arrive at the _ logarithmic _ class of @xmath1-oscillators , whose members are labeled by some real @xmath122 ,  @xmath118 . likewise , by imposing on the @xmath0-oscillators the relation @xmath123 we get the _ exponential _ class of @xmath1-oscillators whose members are also labeled by @xmath122 .",
    "typical representatives of the two classes are shown in fig .  3 and fig .  4 .",
    "[ hbtp ]    _ remark 3 . _ as seen from fig .  3 ,",
    "the @xmath1-oscillator obtained from the master @xmath9-oscillators with @xmath117 at @xmath124 , see line d , does not admit the degeneracies @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( and the intermediate ones @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) : indeed , the line d does not cross those degeneracy curves . likewise , the @xmath1-oscillator obtained from the master @xmath9-oscillators by imposing @xmath129 with @xmath130 , see the curve a in fig .  4 , does not admit the degeneracies @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( as well as @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) .",
    "this peculiarity is in sharp contrast with the class of @xmath1-oscillators produced by @xmath106 , see above , which admit all the degeneracies occurring in the td - oscillator and in @xmath9-oscillators .",
    "_ remark 4 .",
    "_ the expressions for energy @xmath131 in the cases of _ exp_-class and _ ln_-class of @xmath1-oscillators can be explicitly given in complete analogy with eq .",
    "( 16 ) of the @xmath106 class .",
    "next , it is clear that due to the symmetry @xmath132 encoded in ( 3 ) , ( 7 ) , the roles of the deformation parameters @xmath1 and @xmath11 are interchangeable . therefore , the _ exp_-class and the _ ln_-class are dual ( or inverse ) to each other .    [ hbtp ]    _ remark 5 .",
    "_ of course there exist , besides those given above , many other non - standard classes of one - parameter @xmath1-oscillators exhibiting analogous degeneracy properties . to obtain any such class or a concrete desired nonstandard @xmath1-oscillator by imposing an appropriate relation @xmath120",
    ", we should guarantee : ( @xmath133 ) monotonic character of @xmath120 in the quadrant of @xmath16-plane given in ( 8) ; ( @xmath134 ) validity of the property @xmath135 .",
    "say , the relation @xmath136 gives admissible example .",
    "the first point to be emphasized is the behavior of @xmath137-th level energy @xmath131 as function of the particle number @xmath137 .",
    "we find qualitative similarity between the shape of @xmath138 for the td @xmath1-oscillator@xcite and that of @xmath138 for the nonstandard versions of @xmath1-oscillator considered in the present paper . instead of trying to illustrate all possible cases , we present in fig .  5 , for different @xmath1 , the picture of @xmath138 for one typical member of the _ exp_-class of @xmath1-oscillators , namely the one got through setting @xmath139 . as the fig .",
    "5 demonstrates , the basic features of @xmath138 are the same as for the td deformed oscillator : ( i ) existence of maximum and hence the ability to realize a degeneracy within certain pair of levels ; ( ii ) location of the maximum more and more to the right for successively larger values of @xmath1 ( compare the @xmath140 curve with those for @xmath141 or @xmath142 ) , with the tendency to turn into straight line @xmath143 ( i.e. , equal spacing of levels ) of the standard oscillator in the limit of @xmath144 .",
    "let us emphasize once more the peculiar behavior , see fig .  5 , of energy spectrum of the considered @xmath1-deformed oscillators versus standard one .",
    "namely , while the lowest value of energy is @xmath145 for all the oscillators , both standard and @xmath1-deformed , the energy @xmath146 of the considered @xmath1-oscillators , after growing for few values @xmath147 of the quantum number @xmath137 , becomes a decreasing function of @xmath137 , with @xmath148 when @xmath149 .",
    "this very special behavior of energy spectrum can be of use in describing some exotic physical systems ( maybe , relativistic , and with complicated interaction ) .",
    "[ hbtp ]    the other point is the application of new versions of @xmath1-oscillators , or @xmath1-bosons , in the framework of respective versions of @xmath1-bose gas model and their use for description of non - bose features@xcite of multi - pion ( and multi - kaon ) correlations observed in experiments on relativistic heavy - ion collisions . for illustration",
    ", we give the picture confirming as well efficient description using the presented classes of @xmath1-bosons .",
    "namely , in fig .",
    "6 we show the behavior of the intercept ( maximal value ) @xmath150 of two - pion momentum correlation function derived within the version of @xmath1-bose gas model based on the same version of @xmath1-oscillator obtained through @xmath151 .",
    "three pairs of curves are shown , for the two temperatures 120 mev and 180 mev in each pair .",
    "like in refs .",
    "@xcite , the intercept @xmath150 rises with growing mean momenta and its large momentum asymptotics shows saturation determined by the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "however , unlike the case of arik - coon @xmath1-bosons where asymptotical value of intercept is just the @xmath1 by itself@xcite , in the present version of @xmath1-bose gas model the intercept tends to its asymptotical value given as @xmath152 .",
    "such feature , we hope , opens new possibilities for adjustment to the appearing experimental data .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have revealed the unusual ability of tamm - dancoff @xmath1-oscillator to exhibit , at appropriate _ real _ values of @xmath1 , the accidental double degeneracy within a fixed pair of energy levels .",
    "subsequently , similar type of pairwise degeneracy of energy levels has been demonstrated@xcite in more general setting of two - parameter @xmath0-oscillators if the admissible values of @xmath42 constitute certain continual set .",
    "it appears natural to exploit the @xmath0-oscillators with their property of pairwise energy level degeneracies in order to obtain , by definite reduction , many other unusual one - parameter deformed oscillators with similar properties . in this paper",
    "we presented a simple procedure that really allows to infer , from the `` master '' @xmath0-oscillators , the innumerable sets ( classes ) of new one - parameter models of @xmath1-deformed oscillators all of which inherit , almost completely ( cf .",
    "remark 3 ) , the same pairwise degeneracies , e.g. , the degeneracy @xmath153 , or @xmath154 , or @xmath155 , or others .",
    "our results witness that the td oscillator is not the unique one with such exotic degeneracies , but only a separate case from a plethora of continual classes of @xmath1-oscillators exhibiting the special property of the pairwise degeneracy of energy levels within a fixed pair of them . as in the previous paper@xcite",
    ", the degeneracy occurs at a properly fixed value of the @xmath1-parameter , it concerns single pair of levels and is an accidental one ( without underlying symmetry ) .    of course",
    ", there exist many other possibilities yielding non - standard @xmath1-oscillators which can have even more complicated patterns of degeneracy , e.g. , those realized in ref .",
    "@xcite where the derived models exhibit two double ( two pairwise ) degeneracies that involve two degenerate pairs : @xmath15 * and * @xmath156 .",
    "that means that the procedure developed in this paper and in ref .",
    "@xcite is really able to produce myriads of one - parameter deformed nonlinear oscillators with more and more nontrivial and unusual properties ( patterns ) of degeneracy .",
    "we expect for the considered @xmath1-oscillators many interesting physical applications .",
    "say , it is of interest to explore in more detail the applicability of such @xmath1-oscillators ( @xmath1-bosons ) in the context of effective description of non - bose properties of the two- and multi - pion ( -kaon ) correlations observed in the experiments on relativistic nuclear collisions . in sec .  4 ,",
    "we have made a small step towards possible applications .",
    "it was based on the version of @xmath1-bosons and @xmath1-bose gas involving one special member of the obtained _ exp_-class of nonstandard @xmath1-oscillators .",
    "note in this context that the earlier results on multi - particle correlations of @xmath0-bosons in the two - parameter @xmath0-bose gas model , including the explicit formulas for ( intercepts of ) general @xmath137-particle momentum correlation functions@xcite are very useful .",
    "our conclusion is that the usage of the unusual @xmath1-oscillators , the main subject of our present paper , in the framework of the corresponding @xmath1-bose gas model is , at least , on an equal footing with the other distinguished versions of @xmath1-bosons ( and @xmath1-bose gas model ) , such as arik - coon@xcite , tamm - dancoff @xcite or biedenharn - macfarlane@xcite ones ."
