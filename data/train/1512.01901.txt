    "@xcite record the one - day movement of individuals living in the kanto region of japan , which includes the tokyo metropolitan area .",
    "details of the dataset are given in the methods section .",
    "we randomly chose the mobility track of @xmath0 individuals from this dataset .",
    "time - dependent proximity networks were then constructed by connecting individuals when they came within a certain geographical proximity , defined by a distance threshold @xmath1 ( fig .",

    "a detailed discussion can be found in supplementary information si1 .",
    "we simulated the disease propagation using the agent - based sir model @xcite on the above - mentioned network , which assigns susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) , or recovered ( r ) states to each agent .",
    "we assumed that each agent repeats the same trip pattern every day in the same way as recorded in the people flow data . when a susceptible agent is connected with an infected one , the former",
    "is infected with probability @xmath8 for a time interval @xmath9 .",
    "if a susceptible agent is connected with @xmath10 infected agents , they are infected with probability @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "further details of the stochastic simulation are given in the methods section .",
    "in this study , @xmath8 is sufficiently small which enables us to perform the simulation with the discretised time step .",
    "an infected agent recovers with probability @xmath12 over this time interval .",
    "once @xmath2 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are given , stochastic simulations can be conducted to determine the epidemic dynamics .",
    "we denote the probabilities that agent @xmath15 is in state s , i , or r at time @xmath16 as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively ; the equality @xmath20 holds .",
    "we define the infection probability of agent @xmath15 as @xmath21 , because a recovered agent has experienced the infected state before recovering .",
    "the epidemic dynamics can be characterized by three different stages @xcite : the initial stage , in which stochastic fluctuations are dominant , the exponential growth stage , and the final stage , where nonlinearity suppresses the further spread of the disease .",
    "the latter two stages representing the dynamics of the outbreak are of particular interest . in these stages ,",
    "the time evolution of the epidemic can be approximated by the following deterministic differential equations : @xmath22 here , we approximate the time - dependent adjacency matrix @xmath2 with its time averaged form @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this averaging gives a sufficient approximation of the time evolution of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 if the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are sufficiently small , as discussed in supplementary information si2 .",
    "we also assume that node @xmath15 being susceptible and node @xmath27 being infected are statistically independent events @xcite .",
    "although this assumption does not hold for small networks @xcite , we have verified that the numerical solution of equation  ( [ eq : mf ] ) gives a good approximation of the dynamics if @xmath1 is much greater than the percolation transition point and the giant cluster component is sufficiently large .",
    "one of the most common methods used to analyse the contagion processes within networks is hmf @xcite .",
    "this approach assumes that , in a statistical sense , nodes grouped by the degrees behave in the same way . under this assumption",
    ", one can derive the equation for the infection probability of each agent , and , in the absence of degree correlation , the epidemic threshold , i.e. the critical value of the epidemic s spread , can be represented as a function of the first and second moments of the degree distribution @xcite .",
    "one question that persists is whether such an approximation is valid in realistic networks of human contact . actually , the accuracy of hmf depends on factors such as the mean degree and first - neighbour degree @xcite . for the simplest case of the absence of degree correlation , where hmf is often applied ,",
    "the component of the first eigenvector is proportional to the degree @xcite .",
    "however , this assumption does not hold for the proximity network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : series]a ) .",
    "this highlights the need to develop an analytical framework to identify people with a high infection probability along with the overall infection propagation pattern . in this study , we have developed a method based on spectral decomposition and mode truncation which demonstrates that a small number of dominant modes , which may not necessarily have the largest eigenvalues , give a higher contribution in the prevalence of epidemics .",
    "in this section , we present a method for analysing the final epidemic size based on the spectral analysis of the averaged matrix @xmath23 , and elucidate the relevant dynamics of the epidemic s spread .",
    "the node - wise probabilities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 can be expanded as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the @xmath30th eigenvector of @xmath23 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath31 .",
    "all eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix @xmath23 are real , and can be labeled in descending order as @xmath32 . the normalization condition @xmath33 is adopted . since @xmath34 is symmetric ,",
    "the left and right eigenvectors coincide , and the expansion coefficients can be obtained with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mf ] ) can be rewritten in terms of these expansion coefficients ( supplementary information si3 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the average number of infected and recovered agents , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : series]b .",
    "the time series of @xmath18 is converted to that of @xmath40 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : series]c .    in the exponential stage of the epidemic",
    "spreading , @xmath41 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are small .",
    "the exponential growth of each coefficient @xmath42 can be described by the following linearised equation @xcite @xmath43 ( see supplementary information si4 for the derivation of this expression from the nonlinear mode coupling equation ) .",
    "hence , @xmath44 holds .",
    "it is evident from this equation that a mode with a larger eigenvalue @xmath45 grows faster in this stage . in particular",
    ", the exponential growth rate of the number of infected agents is characterised by @xmath46 .",
    "the stochastic simulation of the agent - based model verifies that @xmath47 is indeed dominant in the initial stage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : series]c ) .",
    "in addition , the epidemic threshold is related to @xmath48 as @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : series]d ) @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : series]c , the coefficients @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) are comparable to @xmath52 in the later stages of the epidemic , where @xmath53 is the node - wise average of a vector @xmath54 .",
    "the importance of each mode needs to be assessed to ascertain its dominance in the spreading mechanism .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a quantifier of the _ contribution _ of each mode to the prevalence as @xmath55 the definition of this contribution enables us to account for the prevalence as the sum of the contributions of all modes , @xmath56 .",
    "it is worth introducing the contribution @xmath57 for the case where all agents are infected , i.e. @xmath58 for all @xmath15 .",
    "since the coefficients satisfy @xmath59 in this case , one can easily verify that @xmath60 holds .",
    "interestingly , the contribution @xmath57 does not monotonically increase with the eigenvalue , although a positive correlation can be observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final_size]a ) .",
    "since @xmath61 and @xmath57 are functions of the average of the eigenvector components , a mode associated with a smaller eigenvalue may contribute more than one with a larger eigenvalue .",
    "although the larger eigenvalue denotes faster growth in the exponential regime , it does not necessarily mean a larger contribution to the prevalence .",
    "it is interesting to note that the `` hidden '' important structures , corresponding to modes that make a large contribution to the prevalence but have smaller eigenvalues , are unravelled through the spectral analysis .",
    "it is still possible to detect such modes when the prevalence is much smaller than the all - infected case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final_size]b ) .",
    "the heterogeneity in the contribution is evident from the cumulative contribution @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final_size]c ) . here ,",
    "the modes are sorted such that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes the permutation of the index set @xmath66 .",
    "note that @xmath67 holds , because the infection pattern is represented using all modes .",
    "figure [ fig : final_size]c suggests @xmath68 for the all - infected case , indicating that approximately 90% of the prevalence is described by the top 10% of modes for the present proximity network .",
    "this figure indicates that the number of modes needed to describe the prevalence decreases if the prevalence is smaller than @xmath69 .",
    "the above observations led us to the idea of describing the epidemic dynamics with a small number of dominant modes that give a high contribution . in the case of the agent - based sir dynamics",
    ", we can derive the truncated equation for the contributions at the final time with @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) modes , @xmath72 , as @xmath73     \\frac{\\phi_j^{(\\sigma(b ) ) } } { \\langle \\phi^{\\sigma ( b ) } \\rangle } \\right\\ } ,      \\label{eq : self - conf_eig } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 .",
    "this equation is derived in the methods section .",
    "this transcendental equation approximates the epidemic dynamics with fewer effective degrees of freedom .",
    "if we use all the modes , i.e. @xmath75 , the solution of equation ( [ eq : self - conf_eig ] ) coincides with the solutions of equation  ( [ eq : mf ] ) for @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the solution of this equation computed with newton s method provides a good description of the contribution obtained by the stochastic simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final_size]d ) .",
    "we further note that considering fewer than @xmath0 modes suffices to approximate the prevalence as obtained by the stochastic simulation ( figs .",
    "[ fig : series]d ,  [ fig : final_size]c ) . hence",
    ", this procedure replaces the need to solve an ordinary differential equation in @xmath77 independent variables ( [ eq : mf ] ) with the requirement to use information from the @xmath70 dominant modes .    as discussed above",
    ", the essence of theoretical analyses of epidemic spreading within networks is to infer the dynamical information from the network topology .",
    "conventionally , hmf @xcite uses degree distributions and degree correlations as topological information .",
    "in contrast , our approach uses spectral information , which can take more general properties of the network topology into account . as described in the methods , the final size equation in hmf @xcite",
    "is derived from equation  ( [ eq : self - conf_eig ] ) under the following simple assumptions : ( i ) degree correlation is absent , and ( ii ) the first mode almost perfectly governs the dynamics . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : series]a , the first assumption is not satisfied in the proximity network .",
    "moreover , it is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig : series]d and [ fig : final_size]a that considering only the first mode is not sufficient to account for the whole epidemic dynamics , as @xmath78 is less than 6% .",
    "the contribution of other dominant modes must be taken into account to quantify the epidemic dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : final_size]d ) .",
    "thus , hmf with no degree correlation is not a sufficient approximation for the proximity network .",
    "it would be possible to improve the approximation by considering the degree correlation in hmf @xcite , but it is generally difficult to include information about the second - nearest neighbours .",
    "in contrast , the proposed approach provides the flexibility to improve the approximation by using an arbitrary number of dominant modes .",
    "another feature of epidemic spreading in proximity networks is the strong heterogeneity of the infection risk in space and time .",
    "it is important to identify such locations that have a high probability of infection , namely `` hot spots '' , for the mitigation and management of the epidemic .",
    "the spatial distribution of the hot spots can be mapped to provide an insight into the nature of epidemic spreading in urban areas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : risk ] ) .",
    "more importantly , to uncover the relevant epidemic dynamics , such identification should be conducted with fewer parameters than the number of agents .    for the present model to be predictive ,",
    "let us infer the infection probability of a test agent from the mobility pattern of other agents .",
    "the probability of infection of this agent depends on the presence of other infectious agents in the vicinity , which in turn varies from region to region and at different times of day , @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 be a position vector and @xmath81 be the position of agent @xmath15 at time @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce a kernel function @xmath82 signifying the presence or absence of any interaction between two agents based on the distance between them .",
    "since agents are connected within the threshold @xmath1 , the heaviside step function @xmath83 is adopted as the kernel function .",
    "this allows us to define a spatio - temporal risk factor of infection @xmath84 as @xmath85 which can be interpreted as the weighted sum of probabilities @xmath21 . integrating @xmath86 along the trajectory of the test agent @xmath87 ,",
    "one can obtain the infection probability of this agent .",
    "details of the derivation are discussed in supplementary information si5 .",
    "figure [ fig : risk]a depicts the spatial distribution of the risk factor @xmath84 across the kanto region of japan . in the present model , which assumes homogeneous parameter values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the high - risk area during",
    "the daytime is the central business district , where many workers are located . in the nighttime ,",
    "certain suburban areas from where people commute to the centre become high risk .",
    "furthermore , people travelling to the central business district from their suburban residences allow the disease to spread over the whole metropolitan area .",
    "figure [ fig : risk]c shows that the infection probability of the test agents can be estimated from the integration of @xmath86 , obtained from stochastic simulation , along its trajectory .",
    "instead of counting the infection probability @xmath21 in the neighbourhood of the region of interest , the spectral properties of the averaged adjacency matrix can be incorporated into the risk factor by choosing the first few high - contribution modes .",
    "namely , one can approximate @xmath21 and @xmath84 as @xmath88 and @xmath89 using @xmath70 modes .",
    "hazard maps based on the mode truncation at different times are similar to those given by the stochastic simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : risk]a ) . moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : risk]d shows that the integration of @xmath90 along the path of the test agents predicts their infection probability .",
    "thus , we conclude that mode truncation enables us to describe the spatio - temporal infection risk with a small number of modes . in other words , few modes that have high contributions",
    "dominate the spread of the epidemic .",
    "data on human mobility , particularly contact information of urban residents , play a key role in the analysis of an epidemic spreading . such high - resolution data allow detailed individual - level modelling , rather than coarse - grained metapopulation studies . at the same time",
    ", novel theoretical tools can be used to uncover the dominant dynamics at work in data - driven models without the need for oversimplification .",
    "linear analysis characterises the exponential growth in the initial stage ; nonetheless , this study clarified that the final size of the epidemic is provided by the analysis of various modes .",
    "the mode truncation described here revealed that the prevalence of epidemics is actually dominated by a small number of modes as compared to the number of agents , i.e. the effective number of degrees of freedom is much smaller than the system size .",
    "the proposed method practically limits the expanse of mitigation policies such as targeted vaccination , and provides specific alerts by following the spreading trail of infection .",
    "this also quantifies the spatio - temporal risk associated with empirical travel patterns .",
    "the analytical framework and realistic mobility data presented here provide a promising starting point for the study and possible confrontation of epidemics in the real world .",
    "future studies should examine ways to facilitate the rapid decay of dominant modes using dynamic intervention strategies .",
    "people flow data were generated based on person ",
    "trip surveys made by japan s ministry of land , infrastructure , transport , and tourism . the surveys were based on questionnaires that asked about basic individual information such as gender , age , occupation , places visited , and trip modes on one day . for the sake of privacy ,",
    "spatial information was recorded with a resolution such that the complete location could not be determined .",
    "the questionnaires allowed us to access advanced information such as transportation modes , travel times , transfer points , and trip purposes .",
    "traces of the trips between two places reported in the raw data were interpolated using geographical information systems methods @xcite .",
    "the proximity network was constructed by placing a link between two individuals at time @xmath16 if they were within the threshold distance @xmath1 of one another ( fig .  [ fig : map]b ) .",
    "we added another constraint by only placing a link between individuals using the same transportation mode ; it is impractical to connect individuals walking along the road with those traveling in an automobile or train because of the improbability of the transmission of infection .",
    "the connectivity of the network can be described by the time - dependent adjacency matrix @xmath2 , where @xmath91 if individuals @xmath15 and @xmath27 are connected at time @xmath16 and @xmath92 otherwise .",
    "this allowed us to obtain networks for @xmath0 agents at every @xmath9 time interval .",
    "proximity networks are spatially embedded temporal networks , which appear in various forms of transportation and infrastructure networks @xcite .",
    "the agent - based sir model simulation was performed with the same time - dependent adjacency matrix @xmath2 .",
    "the time evolution of the probabilities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 was computed using 500 independent stochastic simulation runs with different random initial conditions .",
    "we also assumed that the human mobility patterns had a periodicity of 24 h owing to the circadian nature and economic situation of people going to their place of work and back home .",
    "parameter values were taken as @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , except for fig .",
    "[ fig : series]d , in which @xmath13 varies .",
    "one of the main results of this article , the equation for the asymptotic solution of equation  ( [ eq : self - conf_eig ] ) , is derived as follows .",
    "substituting the expansion ( [ eq : expansion ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : mf ] ) , we obtain @xmath96 let us define @xmath97 \\phi_j^{(a ) } , \\label{eq : psi - r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the solution of this equation is given as @xmath98 or equivalently , @xmath99    for @xmath100 , @xmath101 should vanish , and the conservation of probability condition is given as @xmath102 .",

    "we choose @xmath70 ( @xmath106 ) modes and neglect the other modes to obtain @xmath107 \\phi_j^{(\\sigma(b ) ) } \\right\\ } ,      \\label{eq : self - conf_eig_orig2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath108 denote arbitrary permutations of modes .",
    "finally , we multiply both sides by @xmath109 , and obtain equation  ( [ eq : self - conf_eig ] ) by choosing the top @xmath70 modes with respect to their contribution .",
    "the relationship between the equation for the expansion coefficients ( [ eq : self - conf_eig_orig ] ) and that obtained with hmf can be described as follows .",
    "we concentrate on the simplest case , where the probability @xmath110 that a node with degree @xmath10 and one with degree @xmath111 are connected is proportional to the product of their degrees , i.e. @xmath112 , where @xmath113 denotes the degree distribution of the network satisfying @xmath114 . in this case ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix is @xmath115 , and the component of the corresponding normalised eigenvector is @xmath116 . here",
