    "the first generation of open water / ice cherenkov neutrino telescopes take data ( amanda @xcite , baikal @xcite ) or are under construction ( antares @xcite , nestor @xcite ) while the second generation projects such as icecube @xcite are already in the planning phase .",
    "such devices aim at detection of cosmic high - energy neutrinos .",
    "cherenkov photons from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions near or inside the detector are used to identify neutrinos .",
    "because of their large volume and coarse granularity , the energy threshold of these _ open _ instruments is typically between 10  gev and 100  gev and therefore high when compared to that of closed underground cherenkov detectors , such as superkamiokande and sno .",
    "the flux of neutrinos produced by interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere ( so called atmospheric neutrinos ) falls steeply with energy ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "hence the event rate due to atmospheric neutrinos is largest near the detection threshold energy .",
    "this is different for astrophysical neutrino fluxes which generally are assumed to have harder spectra .",
    "potential sources for astrophysical neutrinos could be astrophysical objects such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) or heavy relic particles , such as produced e.g.  in decays of topological defects ( td ) .",
    "the relevant range of neutrino energies from the more conventional sources such as agn and grbs range from @xmath3  gev , to @xmath4  gev , energies while the range of neutrinos expected from td models extends up to @xmath5  gev energies .",
    "apart from the desired astrophysical neutrinos and atmospheric neutrinos , high - energy neutrino telescopes detect muons produced in cosmic ray interaction in the atmosphere ( so called atmospheric muons ) . due to the low interaction probability of neutrinos ,",
    "the trigger rates due to atmospheric muons is generally orders of magnitude higher than that of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "hence a large number of search strategies are used , for example using the earth as a shield and selecting only events with horizontal and upward going directions .    in the analysis of the data of neutrino telescopes , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations play a decisive role in designing and testing event reconstructions and filters , determining filter efficiencies and interpreting the results .",
    "various programs exist for event simulations .",
    "for example , atmospheric muons can conveniently be simulated with the air - shower program corsika @xcite .",
    "the generated muons are further propagated through the overburden consisting of water or ice using muon propagation programs such as mmc @xcite , mum @xcite or propmu @xcite . in a final step",
    "the detector response needs to be simulated using detector specific programs .",
    "programs for simulating neutrino events are known to exist within various collaborations , however , to our knowledge they are not publicly available . in particular most programs",
    "simulate only some specific classes of events ( for example @xmath6 reactions ) in a limited range of energies .    here , we present the program anis for simulating neutrino events of all flavors in a wide range of energies .",
    "anis is a monte carlo event generator , which prepares neutrinos , propagates them through the earth and in a last step simulates a neutrino interaction within a specified volume around the detector .",
    "the aim of the program is to provide a tool for precise simulation of neutrino events of all flavors in the energy range addressed by high - energy neutrino telescopes .",
    "the program has been designed to fulfill the requirements for analysis of amanda data , and could hence be of use for other neutrino telescopes .",
    "an application of anis was demonstrated in @xcite , where the expected rates for @xmath7 events as calculated with anis were presented .",
    "the source code as well as further documentation can be obtained from the project web site : .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first a general description of the program is given in section [ description ] .",
    "the implemented neutrino interaction processes are shortly discussed in section [ interactions ] . the possibility to add a new ( non - standard model ) interaction process to anis is demonstrated there by an example . in sections [ tau ] and [ propagation ] the role of tau leptons and how neutrino propagation is simulated in anis are discussed . a description of the treatment of the final neutrino interactions inside the detection volume follows in section [ volume ] .",
    "additional information relevant for potential users is given in the appendix .",
    "anis is written in c++ and uses the vector package of the clhep library @xcite as well as the hepmc monte carlo event record @xcite .",
    "the event record holds all interaction vertices with their respective incoming and outgoing particles .",
    "the currently implemented interaction channels include charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions as well as resonant @xmath8 production : @xmath9 .",
    "primary neutrinos are randomly generated on the surface of the earth .",
    "currently only power - law energy spectra @xmath10 are implemented , however the code is flexible enough to allow its extension to arbitrary neutrino spectra .",
    "anis propagates neutrinos in small steps towards the detector . in interactions with matter",
    "they are either absorbed ( cc - case ) or regenerated at lower energies ( nc - case ) . in the special case of cc @xmath11 interaction , a short - living @xmath12-lepton is produced .",
    "it propagates in matter , thereby loosing part of its energy , and finally decays giving rise to a secondary @xmath11 and , in @xmath13 of the cases , to secondary @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the density profile of the earth used for neutrino propagation is chosen according to the preliminary earth model @xcite .",
    "once the detection volume is reached , a final vertex is generated along the neutrino trajectory within the detection volume . in the case of a cc @xmath14-interaction",
    ", anis correctly simulates the muon scattering angle .    along with the full event ,",
    "four weights are stored : a normalization constant , a weight proportional to the total interaction probability of the neutrino as well as two weights corresponding to the atmospheric flux of electron and muon neutrinos @xcite .",
    "event rates for atmospheric and various extraterrestrial neutrino spectra are obtained by applying the appropriate weights to the events .",
    "this last step can conveniently be done by a user defined energy dependent weight function applied within analysis programs as e.g.  paw @xcite and root @xcite .",
    "applications of the weights are further discussed in appendix [ sec : use ] .",
    "there are currently two output formats implemented : i ) the amanda specific event format _ f2000 _",
    "@xcite and ii ) the hepmc _ ascii _ format @xcite .",
    "at @xmath15  gev , deep inelastic @xmath16-cross - sections  may be successfully described in the framework of pqcd .",
    "parameterization of the @xmath17  structure functions , @xmath18 , may be chosen e.g.  according to cteq5 @xcite . here , @xmath19 is the invariant momentum transfer , with the 4-momentum @xmath20 given by the difference in momenta between the incoming neutrino and outgoing lepton .",
    "the `` bjorken '' variable @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the energies of the incoming neutrino and outgoing lepton .    at higher energies cross - sections",
    "are dominated by scattering off sea - quarks with small @xmath21 .",
    "the unknown behavior of the structure functions  at @xmath25 makes the calculations model dependent .",
    "the uncertainty in extrapolations of @xmath18 to small @xmath21 and large @xmath26 influences the expected cross - sections at high energies .",
    "two options are presently included in anis : i ) the smooth both with respect to @xmath21 and to @xmath26 power - law extrapolation of the pqcd cteq5 parameterization to small @xmath21 and large @xmath26 , and ii ) hard pomeron @xcite enhanced extrapolation @xcite . the cross - sections  of the first case , denoted in the fig .",
    "1a as pqcd , practically coincide with @xcite , while the second model ( hp , dash - dotted curves ) predicts approximately @xmath27 times higher cross - sections  at @xmath28  gev .",
    "a kinematically important variable is @xmath29 , which characterizes the energy transfer to the outgoing lepton and to the final hadronic state .",
    "the @xmath30-distributions , normalized to the corresponding cross - sections , are plotted in fig .",
    "1b ; the solid and dashed curves stand for cc and nc @xmath17-interactions , respectively .",
    "the scattering angle , @xmath31 , between incoming neutrino and outgoing lepton is given by @xmath32 the used cross - section data for cc- and nc - reactions are taken from pre - calculated tables .",
    "the total cross - section is obtained through interpolation between energy bins .",
    "a final state can be represented by the pair of @xmath21 and @xmath30 .",
    "large sets of @xmath21 and @xmath30 have been generated for different energies and are stored in data tables . during generation of neutrino events such pairs are randomly drawn from the tables .",
    "the use of pre - calculated tables makes the program fast and independent of other packages .    - and resonance @xmath33-cross - sections   and b ) normalized @xmath30-distributions . ]    - and resonance @xmath33-cross - sections   and b ) normalized @xmath30-distributions . ]    since @xmath34 , at high energies practically all @xmath35-cross - sections  are negligibly small , with the exception of resonant @xmath8 production @xmath36 at @xmath37  gev ( the so called glashow resonance , @xcite ) ( see fig .",
    "this process is also included in anis .",
    "anis was designed such that new cross - sections and processes can be added at a later stage .",
    "assuming for example , one would like to allow microscopic black hole production @xcite one has to derive a new ( c++ ) class for this process and provide the relevant member functions :     class sigmabh : public sigma \\ { + @xmath38 public : + @xmath39 double getsigma(const genparticle * neutrino , double material [ ] ) ; + @xmath39 void fillvertex(genvertex * vertex , double material [ ] ) ; + } +   + getsigma returns the cross section , and the function fillvertex inserts the final state . by adding this new process to the list of know processes ,",
    "it will be included during simulation .",
    "thereby all particles produced in the final states are written to the event record and in case of neutrinos are further propagated . in this way , any potential implications of non - standard model physics can easily be tested .",
    "already implemented sm processes can be modified even without modification of the code , simply by replacement of the cross - section data tables obtained using other programs .",
    "tau leptons can be produced in cc @xmath40-reactions and in resonance @xmath41 scattering .",
    "the average tau decay length is @xmath42 . for energies larger than @xmath43 ,",
    "the energy loss during propagation has to be taken into account , leading to a slower growth of the decay length . in the current version of the program ,",
    "the stochastic effects in the energy loss rate are neglected .",
    "the energy loss rate is assumed to be continuous : @xmath44 with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to muon propagation , neglecting stochastic energy losses does not alter the average @xmath12 range significantly @xcite . at energies of @xmath46  gev ,",
    "the continuous case is essentially indistinguishable from the stochastic case and at energies around @xmath47 gev the difference between the two cases is only a few percent .",
    "the reason , next to the energetic tau decay , is that in case of taus ( hard ) bremsstrahlung is suppressed while ( softer ) nuclear interactions dominate .    in anis",
    ", the tau is propagated in small steps of energy . once the age in the tau rest - frame exceeds the previously determined lifetime the tau decay routines are called .",
    "the tau decay is simulated with the help of tauola @xcite . instead of linking directly to tauola",
    ", we have created tables of final states , consisting of the fractional energy : hadronic ( @xmath48 ) , electro - magnetic ( e , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , muons , and the various neutrino flavors .",
    "thereby we have assumed left - handed polarization of the tau leptons , which is a good approximation for neutrino interactions , if @xmath51 .",
    "the tau decay products are added to the event record and in case of neutrinos are further propagated .",
    "neutrinos are generated at the surface of the earth and then propagated to the detector .",
    "they are assumed to travel along straight trajectories , neglecting the small angle neutrino scattering .",
    "this is a good approximation , since at energies below @xmath52  gev when the average deflection angle ( for example through nc reactions ) becomes larger @xmath53 , the neutrino interaction probability in the earth is small .",
    "a deflection angle of @xmath53 is below the current instrumental resolution of existing or planned neutrino telescopes .",
    "the density profile of the earth is chosen according to the preliminary earth model @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are propagated in small steps through the earth and in case of an interaction one of the active interaction channels is chosen according the inclusive cross - section .",
    "its final state member function is invoked , which adds the final state of the interaction to the event record .",
    "naturally , all propagation effects such as neutrino absorption , @xmath54 regeneration , regeneration in nc interactions as well as possible neutrino production in the resonant scattering of electrons ( e.g. , @xmath55 ) are included .",
    "the size of the detection volume needs to be specified in the steering file .",
    "the shape of the volume is a cylinder with its @xmath56-axis parallel to the neutrino directions .",
    "since open water / ice cherenkov detectors have a sensitivity to events with vertices outside their fiducial volumes , the size of the cylinder should be chosen appropriately .",
    "in particular due to the potentially long range of muon and tau leptons , the final cylinder should extend to the direction of the neutrino origin . as an alternative",
    ", one can choose a cylinder with a variable length which adjusts to the energy - dependent maximally possible muon and tau range .",
    "the latter allows a more efficient simulation .     between the incoming neutrino and the outgoing muon in a cc reaction as a function of the neutrino energy .",
    "]    neutrinos reaching the detection volume are forced to interact within this volume .",
    "the interaction probability is stored in the event record .",
    "two options are implemented : i ) all events are written to disk  in order to obtain a physical spectrum , one needs to weight all events with their interaction probability , and ii ) events are sampled according their interaction probability  the events are sampled using an acceptance - rejection method , where the selection criteria are determined at run time during initialization .",
    "the final state depends on the flavor of the interacting neutrino , the type of the reaction as well as on the variables @xmath21 and @xmath30 of the interaction .",
    "since cherenkovneutrino telescopes can not distinguish the different types of hadrons , the hadronization of the final state is omitted and all hadronic energy is written out as pions . since neutrino telescopes have a muon angular resolution of @xmath57 ) , the scattering angle between incoming neutrino and outgoing muon needs to be taken into account .",
    "[ theta ] shows the average scattering angle for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos as obtained with anis .",
    "all muons of the final state have to be further propagated using dedicated muon propagations programs ( such as mmc or mum ) , before the events are passed to the detector simulation .",
    "a new program for the simulation of neutrino induced events for high - energy neutrino telescopes is presented .",
    "the program fulfills current requirements for data analysis of neutrino telescopes , and is designed flexible such that new processes could be added in the future .",
    "the current version of anis includes all relevant sm neutrino interaction processes .",
    "the energies for which cross - section data is provided ranges from 10  gev to @xmath0  gev .    * acknowledgments *    we acknowledge the contributions of tonio hauschild , suggestions and feedback from stephan hundertmark , as well as discussions with gary hill .",
