    "air force to utilize a heterogeneous set of physical links ( rf , optical / laser and satcom ) to interconnect a set of terrestrial , space and highly mobile airborne platforms ( satellites , aircrafts and unmanned aerial vehicles ( anps ) ) to form an airborne network ( an ) . the design , development , deployment and management of a network where the nodes are mobile are considerably more complex and challenging than a network of static nodes .",
    "this is evident by the elusive promise of the mobile ad - hoc network ( manet ) technology where despite intense research activity over the last fifteen years , mature solutions are yet to emerge @xcite .",
    "one major challenge in the manet environment is the unpredictable movement pattern of the mobile nodes and its impact on the network structure . in case of an airborne network ( an ) ,",
    "there exists considerable control over the movement pattern of the mobile platforms .",
    "a senior air force official can specify the controlling parameters , such as the _ location , flight path and speed _ of the anps to realize an an with desired functionalities .",
    "such control provides the designer with an opportunity of develop a topologically stable network , even when the nodes of the network are highly mobile .",
    "we view the an as an infrastructure ( a wireless mesh network ) in the sky formed by mobile platforms such as aircrafts , satellites and uavs to provide communication support to its clients such as combat aircrafts on a mission .",
    "just as an airborne warning and control system ( awacs ) aircraft plays a role in a mission by providing communication support to fighter aircrafts directly engaged in combat , we believe that the aircrafts and anps forming the an will provide similar support to the combat aircrafts over a much larger area . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aircorridor1 ] , the combat air crafts on a mission fly through a zone referred to as an _ air corridor_. in addition to forming a connected backbone network , the anps are also required to provide complete _ radio coverage _ in the air corridor so that the combat aircrafts , irrespective of their locations within the air corridor , have access to at least one backbone node ( i.e. , an anp ) and through it , the entire network .",
    "accordingly , the an is required to have two distinct properties : ( 1 ) the backbone network formed by the anps must remain _ connected at all times _ , even though the topology of the network changes with the movement of the anps , and ( 2 ) the entire three dimensional space of the air corridor is _ covered at all times _ by the continuously moving anps . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first paper that proposes an architecture for an an and provide solutions for the _ all time connected - coverage problem of a three - dimensional space with mobile nodes_.        one of the pioneering results in three dimensional coverage problem for sensor networks was presented by haas _",
    "_ @xcite in which they concluded that the truncated octahedron has the highest volumetric quotient ( the ratio of the volume of a polyhedron to the volume of its circumsphere ) among all the space filling polyhedrons and utilized this to develop placement strategies for three dimensional underwater sensor networks .",
    "their scheme is a centralized one .",
    "distributed protocol of achieving three dimensional space coverage is found in the research of tezcan _ et al .",
    "@xcite later on introduced the notion of @xmath0 graphs and used it to obtain three dimensional sensor coverage .",
    "similar research aiming at the coverage problem in 3d was also presented by @xcite .",
    "however none of these researchers put any emphasis on the problem of obtaining coverage while the constituting nodes are mobile in a three dimensional space .",
    "the mobile nature of the anps in airborne networks add yet another dimension of difficulty to the 3d coverage problem .    in this paper we first propose an architecture for an an where airborne networking platforms ( anps - aircrafts , uavs and satellites ) form the backbone or mobile base stations of the an , and the combat aircrafts on a mission function as mobile clients . we then proceed to determine the the number and initial location of the anps , their velocity and transmission range , so that the dynamically changing network retains properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) mentioned in the previous paragraph . the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sysmodel ] , we provide the system model and an architecture of an airborne network .",
    "section [ sec : probformulation ] formally states the connectivity problem for an an . in section [ sec :",
    "connectivity ] , we provide an algorithm that finds the velocity and the transmission range of the anps so that the dynamically changing network remains connected at all times .",
    "section [ sec : routing ] presents a routing algorithm that ensures a connection between the source - destination node pair with the fewest number of path switching .",
    "given the dimensions of the air corridor and the radius of the coverage sphere associated with an anp , section [ sec : coverageprobformulation ] formulates the coverage problem for the air corridor .",
    "section [ sec : coveragesolution ] presents an algorithm that finds the fewest number of anps required to provide complete coverage of the air corridor at all times .",
    "the section [ sec : conncoverage ] combines results of sections [ sec : connectivity ] and [ sec : coveragesolution ] and presents an algorithm to provide connected - coverage to the air corridor at all times . in section [ sec : visualization ] we briefly describe a visualization tool that we developed to demonstrate the movement patterns of the anps and its impact on the resulting dynamic graph and the coverage volume of the backbone network .",
    "the results of experimental evaluations of our algorithms and related discussion is presented in section [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "a schematic diagram of our view of an an is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : airborne ] . in the diagram , the black aircrafts are the airborne network platforms ( anp ) , the aircrafts that form the infrastructure of the an ( although in fig .  [",
    "fig : airborne ] , only aircrafts are shown as anps , the uavs and satellites can also be considered as anps ) .",
    "we assume that the anps follow a circular flight path .",
    "the circular flight paths of the anps and their coverage area ( shaded spheres with anps at the center ) are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : airborne ] .",
    "thick dashed lines indicate the communication links between the anps .",
    "the figure also shows three fighter aircrafts on a mission passing through space known as _ air corridor _ , where network coverage is provided by anps 1 through 5 . when the fighter aircrafts are at point p1 on their flight path , they are connected to anp4 because point p1 is covered by anp4 only . as the fighter aircrafts move along their flight trajectories , they pass through the coverage area of multiple anps and there is a smooth hand - off from one anp to another when the fighter aircrafts leave the coverage area of one anp and enter the coverage area of another .",
    "the fighter aircrafts are connected to an anp as long as they are within the coverage area of that anp . at points",
    "p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p5 and p6 on their flight path in fig .",
    "[ fig : airborne ] , the fighter aircrafts are connected to the anps ( 4 ) , ( 2 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 1 , 3 ) and ( 1 ) , respectively .",
    "one major difference between the wireless mesh networks deployed in many u.s .",
    "cities @xcite and the ans is the fact that , while the nodes of the wireless mesh networks deployed in the u.s .",
    "cities are static , the nodes of an an are highly mobile . however , as noted earlier , the an designer has considerable control over the movements of the mobile platforms forming the an .",
    "she can decide on the _ locality _ where the aircraft / anps should fly , its _ altitude , flight path _ and _ speed of movement_. control over these four important parameters , together with the knowledge of the _ transmission range _ of the transceivers on the flying platforms , provides the designer with an opportunity for creating a fairly stable network , even with highly mobile nodes . in this paper , we make a simplifying assumptions that two anps can communicate with each other whenever the distance between them does not exceed the specified threshold ( transmission range of the onboard transmitter ) .",
    "we are well aware of the fact that successful communication between two airborne platforms depends not only on the distance between them , but also on various other factors such as ( i ) the line of sight between the platforms @xcite , ( ii ) changes in the atmospheric channel conditions due to turbulence , clouds and scattering , ( iii ) the banking angle , the wing obstruction and the dead zone produced by the wake vortex of the aircraft @xcite and ( iv ) doppler effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , the transmission range of a link is not a constant and is impacted by various factors , such as transmission power , receiver sensitivity , scattering loss over altitude and range , path loss over propagation range , loss due to turbulence and the transmission aperture size @xcite .",
    "however , the distance between the anps remains a very important parameter in determining whether communication between the anps can take place , and as the goal of this research is to understand the basic and fundamental issues of designing an an with twin invariant properties of coverage and connectivity , we feel such simplifying assumptions are necessary and justified .",
    "once the fundamental issues of the problem are well understood , factors ( i ) through ( iv ) can be incorporated into the model to obtain a more accurate solution .",
    "it is conceivable that even if the network topology changes due to movement of the nodes , some underlying structural properties of the network may still remain invariant .",
    "a structural property of prime interest in this context is the _ connectivity _ of the dynamic graph formed by the anps .",
    "we want the anps to fly in such a way , that even though the links between them are established and disestablished over time , the underlying graph remains connected at all times .",
    "although we give connectedness of the graph as an example of a structural property , many other graph theoretic properties @xmath1 can be specified as design requirements for the network .",
    "the problem can be described formally in the following way .",
    "consider @xmath2 nodes ( flying platforms ) in an @xmath3-dimensional space @xmath4 ( for anp network scenario @xmath5 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the coordinates of the node @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , where by convention @xmath9 is considered a @xmath10 column vector , and by @xmath11}^t$ ] , the @xmath12 vector resulting from stacking the coordinates of the nodes in a single vector .",
    "suppose that the dynamics of node @xmath7 ( for all @xmath13 ) , is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the control vector taking values in some set @xmath16 . in vector notation ,",
    "the system dynamics become @xmath17    where @xmath18^t$ ] and @xmath19^t$ ] are @xmath20 vectors , respectively .",
    "the network of flying platforms described by system ( 1 ) , gives rise to a _ dynamic graph _ @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is a dynamic graph consisting of    * a set of nodes @xmath23 indexed by the set of flying platforms , and * a set of edges @xmath24 with @xmath25 as the euclidean distance between the platforms @xmath7 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "since we have control over the node dynamics , the question that naturally arises is whether we can control the motion of the anps so that @xmath21 retains graph - theoretic properties of interest @xmath1 for all time @xmath28 .",
    "a graph @xmath29 is connected if there exists a path between any two nodes of the graph @xmath29 .",
    "often times the property @xmath1 will correspond to the requirement that the graph @xmath29 remains connected at all times .",
    "formally the problem can be stated as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath30 is the set of all graphs on @xmath2 nodes with property @xmath1 .",
    "is it possible to find a control law @xmath31 such that if @xmath32 then @xmath33 for all @xmath34 ?",
    "although a few researchers have studied problems in this domain @xcite , many important questions still remain unanswered .",
    "for example , in our study of the movement pattern of the anps to create a connected network , we assume that the flight paths of the mobile platforms are already known and we want to find out the speed at which these platforms should move , so that the resulting dynamic graph remains connected at all times .",
    "the studies undertaken in @xcite do not address such issues .",
    "although the movement of the airborne platforms will be in a three dimensional space , in a simplified version of the problem in two dimension ( i.e. , when all the aircrafts are flying at the same altitude ) the problem can be stated as follows :    _ mobility pattern for connected dynamic graph ( mpcdg ) _ : this problem has five controlling parameters : + ( i ) a set of points \\{@xmath35 on a two ( or three ) dimensional space ( representing the centers of circular flight paths of the platforms ) , + ( ii ) a set of radii \\{@xmath36 } representing the radii of circular flight paths , + ( iii ) a set of points \\{@xmath37 } representing the initial locations ( i.e. , locations at time @xmath38 ) of the platforms on the circular flight paths , + ( iv ) a set of velocities \\{@xmath39 } representing the speeds of the platforms , and + ( v ) transmission range @xmath40 of the transceivers on the airborne platforms .      in the mpcdg problem scenario , any structural property * p * of the resulting dynamic graph will be determined by the problem parameters ( i ) through ( v ) .",
    "the problems that arise in this formulation are as follows : given any four of the five problem parameters , how to determine the fifth one , so that the resulting dynamic graph retains property * p * at all times ?",
    "most often we would like to know that given ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( v ) , at what speed the anps should fly so that the resulting graph is _ connected _ at all times .",
    "alternately , we may want to determine the minimum transmission range of the anps to ensure connectivity . in this case",
    ", the problem will be specified in the following way . given ( i ) ,",
    "( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) , what is the minimum transmission range of the anps so that the resulting graph is _ connected _ at all times ? in order to answer these questions , we first need to able to answer a simpler question . given all five problem parameters including the speed of the anps , how do you determine if the resulting dynamic graph is connected at all times ?",
    "we discuss this problem next .      in this subsection",
    "we describe our technique to find answer to the question posed in the previous paragraph .",
    "suppose that two anps , represented by two points @xmath7 and @xmath26 ( either in two or in three dimensional space , the two dimensional case corresponds to the scenario where the anps are flying at same altitute ) are moving along two circular orbits with centers at @xmath41 and @xmath42 with orbit radius @xmath43 and @xmath44 as shown in fig .",

    "therefore the distance @xmath55 between the nodes @xmath56 at time @xmath8 is given by : @xmath57 as mentioned earlier , we have assumed that the communication between the anps is possible if and only if the euclidean distance between them does not exceed the communication threshold distance @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that the link between the nodes @xmath7 and @xmath26 is alive ( or active ) when @xmath59    in the analysis that follows , we have assumed that anps are flying at the same altitude , i.e. , we focus our attention to the two dimensional scenario .",
    "however , this analysis can easily be extended to the three dimensional case to model the scenario where the anps are flying at different altitude . in this case",
    "we can view the anps as points on a two - dimensional plane moving along two circular orbits , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> the u.s . air force currently is in the process of developing an airborne network ( an ) to provide support to its combat aircrafts on a mission . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability needed for continuous operation of an an is difficult to achieve through completely infrastructure - less mobile ad hoc networks . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we first propose an architecture for an an where airborne networking platforms ( anps - aircrafts , uavs and satellites ) form the backbone of the an . in this architecture , the anps can be viewed as mobile base stations and the combat aircrafts on a mission as mobile clients . </S>",
    "<S> availability of sufficient control over the movement pattern of the anps , enables the designer to develop a topologically stable backbone network . </S>",
    "<S> the combat aircrafts on a mission move through a space called _ air corridor_. the goal of the an design is to form a backbone network with the anps with two properties : ( i ) the backbone network remains _ connected at all times _ , even though the topology of the network changes with the movement of the anps , and ( ii ) the entire three dimensional space of the air corridor is under _ radio coverage at all times _ by the continuously moving anps .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to proposing an architecture for an an , the contributions of the paper include , ( i ) development of an algorithm that finds the velocity and transmission range of the anps so that the dynamically changing backbone network remains connected at all times , ( ii ) development of a routing algorithm that ensures a connection between the source - destination node pair with the fewest number of path switching , ( iii ) given the dimensions of the air corridor and the radius of the _ coverage sphere _ associated with an anp , development of an algorithm that finds the fewest number of anps required to provide complete coverage of the air corridor at all times , ( iv ) development of an algorithm that provides connected - coverage to the air corridor at all times , and ( v ) results of experimental evaluations of our algorithms , ( vi ) development of a visualization tool that depicts the movement patterns of the anps and the resulting dynamic graph and the coverage volume of the backbone network . </S>"
