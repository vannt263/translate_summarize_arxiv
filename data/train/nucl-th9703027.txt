    "it is widely accepted that the low energy phenomenology can be understood in terms of the mechanism of chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking . in this sense any microscopic theory ( including q.c.d . ) which has a `` correct '' chiral limit will fare equally well in describing low energy hadronic phenomena .",
    "there is however an extra ingredient , the typical hadronic size , which should also play an important role in scattering . to see that this scale is important it is sufficient to consider exotic reactions like k - n scattering for this scale controls the extent of overlap between the bare nucleon and the kaon . in turn",
    "this overlap , when taken together with color saturation and a generic spin - spin interaction for the quarks , accounts for the generic hadronic central repulsion , a feature which is notorious in the n - n system @xcite and one which can also be measured in the k - n exotic s - wave phase shifts @xcite .",
    "exotic reactions like @xmath5 , where the @xmath6 quark can not annihilate with any of the quarks intervening in the reaction can be thought as an effective @xmath7 vertex without the exchange of @xmath8-channel resonances . nor it has @xmath9-channel exchange of pions due to g - parity and therefore constitutes an ideal reaction to probe the low energy content of both the nucleon and the kaon wave functions , i.e. the overlap kernel .    on the other hand the bare rho - pion mass difference",
    "is completely controlled by the extent of chiral symmetry breaking and this mechanism when understood in terms of quarks , amounts to a specific connection between the chiral condensate and the strength of the microscopic hyperfine interaction @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it happens that the obtained strength of this @xmath10 when considered in the exotic k - n s - wave system yields good phase shifts provided we have a small bare nucleon core . at this stage",
    "it should be understood that the size of bare hadrons and the extent of the chiral condensate are not independent quantities but instead they are related to each other .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in hadronic reactions the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is self - consistently exerted in two separate sectors : in the salpeter amplitudes of the intervening hadrons and in the modifications it introduces in the quark - quark effective potentials .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if it is possible to describe in a unified way this central repulsion ( linked with non - annihilating quark amplitudes ) together with quark - antiquark annihilating amplitudes which are not only at the origin of hadronic attraction , the other prominent feature of hadronic scattering and one which can be associated to n - n peripheral attraction , but also at the origin of other effects like strong decay rates .",
    "the n - n peripheral attraction is a central issue at the crossroads between nuclear physics and the hadronic physics .",
    "several attempts to describe this attraction in terms of skyrmion lagrangians have been made but the overall result remains inconclusive . the skyrmion picture although being quite adapted in describing n - n repulsion in terms of topological numbers and despite containing the physics of the pion interaction , it is not simple to accommodate with the yukawa picture of n - n attraction in terms of mesonic exchange and several mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide for this attraction@xcite . on the other hand",
    "the physics of the central n - n repulsion lies outside the domain of the chiral perturbation theory and therefore we can not use this theory to describe the n - n scattering .    any effective theory attempting to describe n - n attraction must also be able to describe the physics of meson - nucleon systems among which we have the @xmath11 system . in this respect",
    "the exotic k - n scattering is much simpler to study than the @xmath11 reaction which being non - exotic , has now quark antiquark annihilating amplitudes which were absent in the exotic k - n .",
    "also we are forced to consider the quasi - goldstone nature of the pion which can be translated in the salpeter language by the existence of two almost degenerate amplitudes ( the so - called e - spin amplitudes ) to describe the pion wave function in contrast with the kaon case which is well described by one salpeter amplitude .    the nambu , jona - lasinio effective lagrangian ( n.j - l.)@xcite with a non - local potential@xcite offers then a simple framework to describe in a unified way ( in the present case with only one parameter for the potential strength besides the current quark masses ) not only the bulk of hadronic spectroscopy but also hadronic scattering phenomena among which we have the coupled",
    "n - n , the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 scattering processes .",
    "it is clear that these processes , when seen from the quark microscopic point of view embodied in the n.j - l .",
    "lagrangian , should correspond to different scattering processes described by the @xmath14 set of lagrangian parameters . in this paper we will use n to represent either the @xmath15 or the nucleon in the cases where it does not matter and reserve the letter",
    "n for the cases which are specific to the nucleon alone .",
    "when dealing with potentials , lorentz covariance becomes a problem not unrelated with the problem of relativistic description of bound states .",
    "covariant generalizations of potentials are available in the literature @xcite but at this stage we will ignore this issue which will be essential for quantitative predictions but certainly not for the qualitative picture which as we will show can be understood in terms of chiral symmetry and color confinement .    in nuclei the necessity of having a microscopic description of the nucleon in terms of quarks is already felt when considering coulomb and magnetic form factors for s - shell and p - shell nuclei like @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "but the simple fact that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken through the appearance of quark - antiquark condensates and considering not only that these new chiral vacua are in turn affected by the presence of quark sources ( the physics of chiral restoration / enhancement ) @xcite but also that we might have excitations of these vacua along the `` mexican hat '' valley of a continuum of chiral states connected with the `` true '' chiral vacuum , should allow us to use the formalism of this paper to investigate and predict the existence of signatures of these states in the nuclear environment .",
    "for this we must have a model accurate enough both in the n - n sector and in the sector of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "this paper constitutes a first step towards this goal .",
    "the remainder of this paper is divided into four sections and three appendices .",
    "section ii is devoted to the introduction of the specific nambu jonas - lasinio effective model that we will be using .",
    "the pion and nucleon salpeter equations will be studied in section iii .",
    "the overlap diagrams for the couplings @xmath18 are presented in section iv . finally in section",
    "vi we discuss the results .",
    "we have three appendices . in the first appendix",
    "some diagrams contributing to the @xmath18 are presented and discussed in detail .",
    "the color overlap results are given in the second appendix .",
    "in the last appendix we discuss , both for the nucleon and the delta , the relevant flavor - spin overlaps .",
    "our quarks are dirac fermions that interact with a simple effective 2-body interaction @xcite such as to simulate color confinement together with the introduction of a scale responsible for the actual particle sizes , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hamiltonian density of the dirac field , and @xmath21 an effective interaction term , @xmath22 \\delta ( t_{x}-t_{y}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath23 s are the gell - mann color matrices .",
    "u is a arbitrarily large constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that physical processes involving color singlets are independent of u whereas any colored objects get an infinite mass when @xmath24 .",
    "different and more complex interactions have also been used in the literature . within the wilson loop context ,",
    "results for the effective microscopic interaction among heavy quarks are available @xcite but unfortunately these results can not be extended to the light quark sector due precisely to the problem of consistency with chiral symmetry .",
    "nevertheless it is customary to make the approximation of dividing the quark effective potential in two additive terms , one dominated by the coulomb force due to one gluon exchange which is responsible for the short distance interaction among quarks and one which plays an important role in the heavy quark spectroscopy , and another term- the confining term - which is responsible for the long distance force among quarks .",
    "in fact this approximation is also effectively used when extracting the heavy quark potentials from the wilson loop .",
    "although there is a great flexibility in the choice of the effective confining potential for the light quark mass sector , it is however not completely arbitrary .",
    "first it must not only to comply with the requirements of the ward identities but also to provide finite results in the colorless sector while pushing the masses of the colored states to infinity .",
    "this is illustrated when we consider a more general dirac structure like , @xmath25 then the axial and vectorial ward identities would have constrained the parameters s , p , a , v and t to obey the following equations,@xcite @xmath26 equation ( [ warcons ] ) implies that the scalar ( s ) , pseudo - scalar(p ) and tensor(t ) interactions do not contribute either to chiral symmetry breaking or to the structure of the ground state hadrons .",
    "finally we must also have , @xmath27 in order to have both the goldstone pion and the other color singlets infrared independent .",
    "as for the shape of the potential , the linear potential has also been extensively studied .",
    "however it seems to yield a much too large hadronic radius .",
    "the potential of equation ( [ hamilton],[hamilton1 ] ) has been used to study the charmonium spectroscopy with a potential strength of @xmath28 . although the theoretical results did not differ too much from the experimental ones it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a more general potential , that we will still need a coulomb force if we want to get a correct value for the r parameter ( which is related with the mass splittings of the @xmath29 triplet ) . and",
    "this happened despite the fact that , @xmath30 , the theoretically obtained masses were quite good when compared with the experimental ones .",
    "it turns out that the charmonium spectroscopy @xcite obtained with the simpler potential of equation ( [ hamilton1 ] ) does not fare too badly either , when we consider individual masses , so that although no one disputes the fact that for short distances a coulomb force is needed , we decided ( also for the sake of mathematical simplicity ) to discard this force as a first step towards a quantitative description of the pion - nucleon coupling",
    ".    therefore the model embodied in equations ( [ hamilton ] , [ hamilton1 ] ) not only seems to sufficiently meet all the above general requirements but also yields reasonable results besides allowing relatively simple calculations .",
    "a covariant version of this model has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and so far it has only been applied to the study of the pion and kaon . for the simple harmonic confining potential the authors obtained a substantial improvement on the value of @xmath31 although still far from a quantitative agreement . coupled channels should constitute another sizeable correction not only to @xmath32 but also to the hadronic decay widths and masses .",
    "even without covariance we have shown @xcite that coupled channels provide a very large correction to @xmath31 therefore substantiating the hope that covariance plus coupled channels might bring the @xmath31 close to its experimental value .",

    "the reason for this is quite simple . from eq .",
    "( [ feyver ] ) the @xmath61 annihilation vertex is of the form @xmath166 being @xmath167 one of the momenta flowing in either the quark or the antiquark leg . in turn",

    "@xcite we obtain the theoretical results , @xmath183    these results are surprisingly good .",
    "we have seen that in order to explain the k - n exotic phase shifts we needed a smaller bare nucleon and therefore a larger @xmath184 . with this @xmath185",
    "we would get @xmath186 of the values just obtained .",
    "however we still have to consider the effects of lorentz covariance and the contribution of the pion cloud around the bare nucleon .",
    "the study of these two effects will constitute a necessary step in this program of obtaining a quantitative microscopic description of low - energy hadronic phenomena .",
    "nevertheless it is already remarkable that such a simple model ( with only one scale @xmath185 apart from the quark masses ) should yield results ( ranging from hadronic spectroscopy to the coupling of pions to nucleons ) which are not obviously wrong .",
    "this is more so if we take in consideration that this model is able to unify in the same description , essentially depending in the chiral angle @xmath187 , the ( exotic ) hadronic repulsion like for instance the nucleon - nucleon repulsive core ( which is of the same nature than the k - n exotic repulsion ) and the n - n peripheral attraction mediated by pions .",
    "retrospectively it is not hard to understand why the `` naive '' @xmath66 model ( qpcm)@xcite for strong decays should perform so well .",
    "it is the minimal model which contains overlap kernels and satisfies parity conservation . in this sense",
    "any microscopic model ( like the present one ) which produces a pion derivative coupling can be simulated by qpcm .",
    "the pion momenta @xmath77 which is present in the hadron - pion coupling @xmath63 and which forces a p - wave pion - hadron outgoing relative wave function can be made to have originated in an `` incoming '' cluster p wave @xmath188 bound state .",

    "the @xmath191 scattering constitutes another area where the present model could and should be tested . at this stage",
    "we can already anticipate that the present model will again produce results which can be simulated by qpcm . to see this",
    "it is sufficient to notice that from the point of view of overlap kernels and as a qualitative guide we can lump together either the two spectator @xmath192 or the two spectator quarks as an effective extended quark or antiquark respectively and therefore understand the @xmath191 scattering as a modified @xmath193 scattering .",
    "the present calculation will therefore constitute a prerequisite to the calculation of the more complicated @xmath191 scattering .",
    "the spectroscopy and scattering reactions for higher angular momenta will constitute another class of stringent tests notably in what concerns the old problem of van der waals forces which we feel can only be realistically compared with experiment in the framework of covariant improvement of this model ( retardation ) .",
    "first a note on notation .",
