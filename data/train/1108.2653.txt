    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : targets ]    internal target beam facilities at storage rings play an important role in atomic , nuclear , and particle physics .",
    "they allow for precision experiments in combination with high luminosities and low physical background .",
    "in contrast to standard fixed - target installations , where the beam hits a target only once , in storage ring experiments the accelerated beam particles traverse the target material after each round - trip , typically with a repetition rate of @xmath1 . in order to make the best possible use of the stored beam",
    "the stationary target must be rather thin , i.e. typically only @xmath2 thick .",
    "this is particularly important if beams of rare particles , such as antiprotons , are used . in these cases",
    "the limited production rate should not be exceeded by the consumption rate .",
    "further limitations of the interaction rate are introduced by the detector setup and the data acquisition system .",
    "such a thin target can be realized by gas at rest , or beams of gas , clusters , or pellets .",
    "depending on the experimental situation , at each passage through the interaction point only a fraction of the stored particles interacts with the target while the other projectiles remain in the beam .",
    "however , some beam losses will happen through scattering .",
    "single scattering losses , where beam particles are kicked out of the acceptance in one collision , can be minimized by a large angular acceptance at the interaction point . by using beam cooling devices , such as electron or stochastic cooling , multiple scattering losses accumulated over many turns can be compensated .",
    "depending on the conditions , the injected accelerator beam can be used for cycle times from minutes to hours .",
    "the luminosity @xmath3 of an internal target experiment is given by the number of circulating beam particles @xmath4 , the revolution frequency @xmath5 of the stored particles , and the target thickness @xmath6 : @xmath7 typical values for these parameters in hadron physics experiments are about @xmath8 circulating particles and an areal target thickness on the order of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "although the requirements for the internal targets might differ from experiment to experiment , some of them are more general : the target thickness should be constant over time to avoid luminosity fluctuations in the data acquisition system .",
    "furthermore the target material should show a homogeneous density distribution at the interaction point .",
    "it should be of highest purity in order to avoid background reactions originating from unwanted target isotopes .",
    "the areal target thickness should be adjustable over a wide range in order to be able to match the requirements of the physics programme and the specific detection system . in the absence of vertex tracking detectors ,",
    "the track and momentum reconstruction for ejectiles is aided by a precise knowledge of the interaction region .",
    "this commonly requires the geometrical target extension to be as small as possible with a sharp boundary between the target and the surrounding vacuum .",
    "the above mentioned requirements might , of course , be very challenging if a special element has to be used as a target material .    in case of experiments where only a low target thickness , on the order of @xmath10 , is desired or needed ( supersonic ) gas jets , produced by the expansion of gases through fine nozzles into vacuum , are typically used . while , in principle , all gaseous target materials could be used and the target thickness would display no time structure , this type of target has the disadvantage of generating a target beam with a large geometrical divergence .",
    "in addition , the spatial target density distribution is locally homogeneous , apart from the distinct structures caused by shock fronts in the immediate vicinity of the nozzle",
    ". one major disadvantage of this type of target is that the nozzle has to be placed close to the interaction point ( @xmath11 ) if high target densities ( @xmath12 ) are required .",
    "this commonly introduces a high gas load to the storage ring vacuum .    on the other hand ,",
    "if a high effective target thickness of up to @xmath13 is desired , a pellet target  @xcite can be used . in this kind of target",
    "micrometer - size frozen spheres , with an individual target thickness on the order of e.g.  @xmath14 , are generated from the target materials .",
    "the use of such microspheres introduces a very distinct time structure in the target beam .",
    "the mean effective target thickness can be modified , either by varying the distance of the pellets , or by changing the pellet size .",
    "this leads to changes in the target thickness of up to an order of magnitude .",
    "details about this type of target can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast , cluster jet targets provide a freely adjustable target thickness of up to about @xmath15  @xcite even at larger distances from the nozzle .",
    "they produce small nanoparticles from cooled gases or liquids via expansion in laval - type nozzles , by either condensation of the gas or by breaking up the liquid into a spray of tiny droplets .",
    "these clusters typically consist of @xmath16 molecules  @xcite .",
    "different to pellet targets , the random nature of the cluster production introduces a homogeneous spatial distribution and no distinct time structure .",
    "all gaseous target materials can be used for this kind of target .",
    "the cross - section of the cluster beam at the interaction point exhibits a well defined boundary so that the interaction region is well defined .",
    "this property has the important consequence that the beam can pass several metres through an ultra high vacuum with constant angular divergence defined by the orifices used for the cluster beam preparation .",
    "future internal fixed - target experiments at storage rings require predominantly high density hydrogen or deuterium targets as effective proton and deuteron / neutron beams . due to their various advantages ,",
    "cluster jet targets are well established in high precision experiments  @xcite .",
    "typical operation parameters of some of the targets used at the celsius ring  @xcite , at the fermilab antiproton accumulator  @xcite , and at cosy  @xcite are listed in table  [ tab : targets ] . due to the finite angular divergence of the cluster beam , the volume target density decreases quadratically with the distance from the nozzle . at these experiments",
    "the distances between the cluster production nozzles and the interaction points range between 0.26  m and 0.65  m , resulting in hydrogen target densities of several @xmath17 .",
    "future facilities for hadron physics experiments will be typically @xmath18 detectors , where the interaction point between the stored beam and the target beam is surrounded by onion - like layers of detectors embedded in a magnetic field , allowing a momentum reconstruction of the charged ejectiles .",
    "one prominent example of such an upcoming installation is the planned panda detector at fair in darmstadt  @xcite .",
    "the proposed detector concept requires that the target source must be mounted outside the coils of the magnet and its surrounding iron yoke , with the result that the distance from the nozzle to the interaction point will increase from around @xmath19 , as in current targets , to more than 2 @xmath20 . for cluster jet targets ,",
    "this increase leads , for geometrical reasons , to a decrease in the target thickness by approximately one order of magnitude . because of this effect",
    ", new studies on higher cluster jet target densities were started in mnster .",
    "we here present a newly developed cluster target device which , for the first time , is able to provide hydrogen cluster beam densities on the order of @xmath15 at a distance of more than two metres from the nozzle .",
    "this achievement opens the way to use the broad advantages of cluster jet beams in future hadron physics experiments with large @xmath18 detectors .",
    "a complete target station was designed and built up which allows one to test improved cluster sources in a geometry which matches that of an internal storage ring experiment with a @xmath18 detector .",
    "since the dimensions of the future panda experiment are specified  @xcite , the distances relevant to this target station were used for the setup . in fig .",
    "[ fig : completetarget ] a cad view of the experimental setup is shown , with the cluster source and its pumping system on the left , a scattering chamber with beam diagnostics in the middle , and the cluster beam dump on the right .",
    "the distance of @xmath21 between the nozzle inside the cluster source and the centre of the scattering chamber is the same as the one planned for the panda experiment .",
    "furthermore , the distance between the scattering chamber and the cluster beam dump also matches the one from panda . in this way",
    "the data obtained can be directly translated to the situation in the planned storage ring experiment .        in the source",
    "the clusters are generated and the shape of the cluster jet is prepared .",
    "the cluster source consists of different vacuum chambers forming a differential pumping system in order to reduce the gas flow from the source into the interaction region .",
    "this is of great importance in an internal storage ring experiment in order to guarantee a low residual gas load on the accelerator beam line , as well as to minimize reactions with the background gas .",
    "the scattering chamber installed is equipped with a beam diagnostic system for the determination of target thickness and geometry .",
    "the attached cluster beam dump is designed to catch the cluster jet beam and to minimize the back flow of gas to the scattering chamber . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacuumsystem ] the complete design of the vacuum system of the target setup is shown .",
    "the individual parts will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "a list of the most important pumps , and typical pressures observed during the experiments in the different pumping stages , is compiled in table  [ tab : pumps ] . for the investigations presented in this work ,",
    "the main emphasis was placed on achieving highest target thicknesses and the measurement of the cluster beam properties .",
    "thus , with exception of the skimmer and the collimator , the orifices connecting neighbouring vacuum chambers have been chosen rather generously in diameter in order to avoid hitting them when changing the cluster beam diameter through the use of different collimator sizes .",
    "therefore , the vacuum conditions presented here are expected to be improved significantly when the cluster beam size is fixed and appropriate orifice diameters are chosen .",

    "apart from the standard way to suppress the gas background by reducing the orifice diameters between the vacuum chambers , there is also the possibility to use cluster beams with optimized cross - sections . at a given target thickness",
    "the flow rate of the cluster beam can be minimized by reducing the beam size transverse the direction of the ion or electron beam .",
    "assuming an ion beam size of one millimetre and a cluster beam size of ten millimetres the gas flow can be reduced by almost one magnitude using a cluster beam with a rectangular cross - section of @xmath37 instead of a circular one .",
    "this concept has been proposed before , e.g. for the ua6 experiment at cern using a polarized atomic beam target @xcite , and used successfully with a cluster jet target at the cosy-11 experiment @xcite .",
    "first tests on this idea have been carried out at the cluster target installation by using specially shaped collimators produced by laser cutting . in fig .",

    "the setup is optimized for panda at hesr where mostly hydrogen will be used as target material .",
    "the clusters are produced by the expansion of cooled hydrogen gas or liquid through a laval nozzle into a vacuum chamber .",
    "the one used , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] , was manufactured in the cern workshop from copper and has a minimum diameter of approximately @xmath42 .",
    "the hydrogen gas , with pressures of up to @xmath43 , has to be purified in order to prevent clogging of the cold nozzle by frozen impurities . for this purpose",
    "a commercial purification system ( johnson - matthey he20 ) based on a palladium membrane is used .",
    "this achieves a purity level of 9.0 , which allows for continuous operation over weeks without any blocking of the nozzle .",
    "in addition a micro filter with a pore size of @xmath44 in the gas input line stops solid particles from entering the gas system .",
    "the gas is cooled by a dual stage gifford - mcmahon - type cold head ( leybold coolpower 10 md ) .",
    "the first stage has a cooling power of @xmath45 at @xmath46 and the second stage @xmath47 at @xmath48 . with this device , and a @xmath49 heating cartridge , the temperature of the fluid directly before the nozzle can be adjusted by using a temperature controller ( lakeshore model 331s ) in the operational region between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in order to minimize the heat transfer by heat conductance from the walls of the vacuum chamber ( room temperature ) to the two stages of the cold head , the new design of the cluster source embeds the cold head in a separate vacuum chamber ( insulation vacuum chamber ) which has no direct connection to the vacuum in the other chambers of the cluster source .",
    "the cold hydrogen passes the laval nozzle , where the clusters are produced during the expansion of the fluid into an adjacent vacuum chamber , the skimmer chamber .",
    "depending on the operational parameters , only a small fraction of the gas produces clusters .",
    "from this cluster jet a certain part , which depends on the experimental requirements , is selected by skimmers .",
    "thus most of the gas flow through the nozzle , i.e.  approximately up to @xmath52 hydrogen gas , has to be pumped away from this chamber . since it was observed that vacuum pressures above @xmath53 lead to a loss of target thickness  @xcite ,",
    "the pumping speed of the pumps used is chosen in order to match this requirement .",
    "therefore , the two pumping systems shown in fig .  [ fig : vacuumsystem ] , each consisting of two roots and one rotary vane pump with a total pumping speed of @xmath54 , are used to evacuate this vacuum chamber .    the clusters produced can be separated from the surrounding gas by using a trumpet - shaped skimmer with an opening diameter of the orifice of @xmath55 ( beam dynamics incorporation ) . a second skimmer , the collimator , is mounted in an adjacent vacuum chamber .",
    "the collimator further reduces the residual gas flow into the accelerator and defines the shape and size of the cluster jet beam at the interaction point . for the data presented here , a collimator with a round orifice with an opening of @xmath56 was used . due to the limited gas conductance of the skimmer , the vacuum chamber where the collimator is located can be pumped by two turbomolecular pumps .",
    "both the skimmer and the collimator are mounted on step - motor - driven @xmath57-@xmath41 tables displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : xytable ] . in this way it is possible to adjust them , e.g.  for alignment purposes during operation , in both directions perpendicular to the cluster beam in steps of one micrometre with a maximum displacement of two millimetres with respect to the central axis of the setup .",
    "the complete setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clustersource ] .        a motor - driven shutter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : clustersource ] , `` beam stop '' ) is installed between the nozzle exit and the orifice of the first skimmer .",
    "this device allows one to stop the cluster jet beam completely in the skimmer stage on a sub - second time scale .",
    "such a feature is of great importance for storage ring experiments where , for each cycle , the injection , acceleration and cooling of the ion beam are best done in the absence of a target stream .",
    "the region between the nozzle and the skimmer can be observed by a camera mounted outside the vacuum at an uhv vacuum window of the skimmer chamber ( fig .",
    "[ fig : clustersource ] ) .",
    "if the temperature and pressure of the incoming gas in front of the nozzle is chosen appropriately in a region where the hydrogen is liquid , the density can be as high that the jet is visible .",
    "an example of an image taken by this camera is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusterjetphoto ] .",
    "the cluster jet , which is clearly visible in this photograph , is illuminated by an optically broadened laser beam ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the vertical structures in the cluster beam are an artifact caused by the optical system . however , the clear horizontal structures in brightness of the jet correspond to density variations .",
    "it is important to note that the bright core inside the beam , which is a region of higher density , is not distributed symmetrically around the central axis of the nozzle but is directed towards the lower part of the picture .",
    "it was observed that the deflection angle of this core depends strongly on the temperature and the pressure of the fluid in front of the nozzle . at high temperatures and low pressures ( e.g.@xmath59 and @xmath60 ) the structures are almost uniform and symmetrically arranged whereas at highest jet densities , corresponding to low temperatures and high pressures ( e.g. @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , both the deflection and the density structure are clearly visible .",
    "this effect is currently under investigation and indicates potential for further improvements of the cluster beam density in the scattering chamber  @xcite .    between the collimator chamber and the beam pipe leading to the interaction point , two additional pumping stages , shown in fig .",

    "the first chamber is equipped with a mnster - type cryopump  @xcite and the next one with a single turbomolecular pump . at the exit of both chambers ,",
    "a skimmer is inserted whose inner diameter is a few millimetres larger than the cluster beam at this position to avoid interference with the cluster beam .",
    "the produced clusters are transferred through a beam pipe with an inner diameter of @xmath63 to the interaction region where the scattering chamber is placed . in the scattering chamber",
    ", the target thickness can be measured at a distance of @xmath21 from the nozzle using a beam diagnostic system discussed in the next section . from this scattering chamber",
    "the clusters are transferred to the cluster beam dump .",
    "the connecting beam pipe , with an inner diameter of @xmath64 , is wider than that between the cluster source and the scattering chamber .",
    "the main design of the beam dump shown in fig .  [ fig : clusterbeamdump ] matches that from the former cosy-11 experiment  @xcite located at the cosy accelerator of the forschungszentrum jlich .",
    "this beam dump consists of four differentially pumped vacuum stages equipped with pumps of different types .",
    "the first and third stages contain cryopumps of the mnster type  @xcite , whereas the other two stages are equipped with turbomolecular pumps .",
    "the complete system is designed to minimize the back flow of the gas from the stopped clusters into the scattering chamber .",
    "this minimization of gas load to the scattering chamber is of special importance if the equipment is used as an internal target at a storage ring . at the final stage",
    "a detector system can be installed in order to measure the cluster velocity .",
    "this system is described in detail in the following section .",
    "one of the most important parameters which characterizes the performance of an internal target is the target thickness , which can be expressed either as volume density @xmath65 or as areal density @xmath66 . in order to measure the target thickness at the interaction point ( `` panda geometry '' ) a vacuum chamber shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatteringchamber ] was installed . in this scattering chamber",
    "a beam diagnostic system , consisting of two movable rods , can be used to determine the target thickness .",
    "the used rods have a diameter of one millimetre which is much smaller than the ten millimetre diameter of the cluster jet .    .",
    "the solid line represents a fit assuming a homogeneous radial volume density of the scanned cluster jet with sharp boundaries while the dashed curve represents a fit to a fermi - like density distribution expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermidensitydistribution ] ) .",
    "the insert shows the radial volume density distributions corresponding to the drawn lines in the pressure distribution . ]",
    "clusters colliding with these rods break up and generate a gas load , which increases the pressure in the vacuum chamber . in a simple model , assuming a constant density in the cross - section between rod and cluster jet , this pressure increase is directly proportional to the total hydrogen mass flow @xmath67 into this vacuum chamber .",
    "this allows a direct target density determination according to : @xmath68 here @xmath69 corresponds to the cross - section of the cluster beam in the scattering chamber , which can be determined by beam - profile measurements using the movable rods , and @xmath70 is the mean velocity of the cluster jet .",
    "an example of such a beam profile measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressureprofile ] . since this simple model can not be used for the analysis of this measured pressure increase , the volume and areal density can be deduced by assuming a certain volume density distribution @xmath71 at the specific distance @xmath72 from the nozzle .",
    "the vacuum pressure @xmath73 as a function of the position @xmath74 of the rod can be calculated from : @xmath75 where @xmath70 is the mean velocity of the clusters , @xmath76 the universal gas constant , @xmath77 the temperature of the gas , @xmath78 the molar mass of the hydrogen molecules , @xmath79 the pumping speed of the vacuum pumps used to evacuate the scattering chamber , @xmath80 the diameter of the scanning rod ( here : @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 the displacement of the maximum of the volume distribution with respect to the coordinate system of the rod , and @xmath83 the background pressure in the chamber . by fitting eq .",

    "the fluctuations seen in both figures can be attributed to a change in the emission angle of the cluster beam from the nozzle . since these fluctuations are reproducible and stable in time it is possible to measure the target thickness as function of the gas pressure and the temperature at the inlet of the nozzle .",
    "this mapping can be used for the adjustment of the luminosity .",
    "furthermore , a nozzle tilting system , as it is discussed below , will allow to smooth the observed fluctuations .",
    "below a nozzle temperature of about @xmath103 a brightness structure was observed in the beam , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusterjetphoto ] . surprisingly these structures , which are regions with different cluster jet densities , are not symmetrically distributed with respect to the cluster beam axis .",
    "therefore , a dedicated mechanical adjustment system is currently under development  @xcite which allows to tilt the nozzle axis with respect to the skimmer axis during target operation .",
    "recently , in first tests using a prototype of such a tilting system very high cluster beam densities have been achieved , i.e. approximately @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) at a distance of two metres behind the nozzle ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) .",
    "this result strengthens the assumption that the decrease of the cluster beam densities at temperature below @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : targetthicknessisobare ] ) is caused by structures within the cluster jet beam and can be compensated by an online alignment .",
    "detailed systematic investigations on this aspect are currently performed .",
    "to perform detailed measurements on cluster beam properties a complete cluster target installation was built in mnster .",
    "this provides the possibility to test cluster jet sources in a geometry that matches the one to be used in future experiments such as panda / fair . by means of a time - of - flight setup based on electron impact ionization , systematic velocity studies on individual clusters are possible .",
    "the design and performance of a newly developed cluster jet source was presented .",
    "this new cluster source , which is a prototype for the panda experiment , is the first one that can provide routinely a hydrogen cluster target thickness of @xmath127 at a distance of two metres behind the nozzle .",
    "together with the high purity of its target material and the absence of a distinct time structure of the beam , this target is ideally suited for future internal fixed - target experiments at storage rings .",
    "furthermore , an even higher target thickness of @xmath128 has been achieved by a dedicated nozzle tilting system .",
    "the authors would like to thank h.  orth for the very inspiring and helpful discussions and h.  baumeister and w.  hassenmeier for their support during the design of the target device .",
    "we are grateful to m.  macri and j.  ritman for providing powerful vacuum pumps .",
    "the work provided by the teams of our mechanical and electronic workshops is very much appreciated and we thank them for the excellent manufacturing of the various components . finally we would like to thank c.  wilkin for suggestions regarding the manuscript .",
