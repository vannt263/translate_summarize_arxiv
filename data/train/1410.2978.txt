    "the investigation of the internal quantum degrees of freedom of electrons lies at the heart of the condensed matter physics .",
    "interest in the electron spin , the most studied examples , extends to other quantum degrees of freedom of electrons such as a valley .",
    "the recent emergence of two - dimensional layered materials - in particular the transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite such as molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) - has provided new opportunities to explore the quantum control of the valley degree of freedom .",
    "the monolayer mos@xmath0 has recently attracted great interest because of its potential applications in two - dimensional ( 2d ) nanodevices  @xcite , owing to the structural stability and lack of dangling bonds , although it had been obtained and studied in the several decades ago  @xcite .",
    "the monolayer mos@xmath0 is a direct gap semiconductor with a band gap of @xmath2 ev  @xcite which enables a wide range of applications such as transistors  @xcite and optoelectronic devices  @xcite .",
    "similar to graphene , the conduction and valence band edges consist of two degenerate valleys @xmath3 located at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone . due to the large valley separating in the momentum space , in the case of the absence of short - range interactions ,",
    "the intervalley scattering  @xcite should be negligible and thus the valley index becomes a new quantum number .",
    "therefore , manipulating the valley quantum number can produce new physical effects .",
    "one of the peculiarities of a monolayer mos@xmath0 is the coupled spin - valley in the electronic structure , which is owing to the strong spin - orbit coupling ( originating from the existence of a heavy transition metal in the lattice structure ) and the broken inversion symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of the strong spin - orbit coupling produces a spin splitting of the valence band and makes the monolayer mos@xmath0 a convenient platform to explore new spin - dependent phenomena and their implementation in spintronic devices .",
    "these features provide us a new way to generate spin- and valley - polarized current in monolayer mos@xmath0 .",
    "recent studies stated that a ferromagnetic behavior  @xcite and a superconducting  @xcite transition can be occurred in mos@xmath0 sheet .",
    "also , the single - layer and multi - layer mos@xmath0 can be @xmath4- or @xmath5-type doped on generating desirable charge carriers  @xcite .",
    "recently , the properties of the charge , spin and valley transport in a monolayer molybdenum disulfide @xmath5/@xmath4/@xmath5  @xcite , ferromagnetic / superconducting / ferromagnetic ( f / s / f )  @xcite and normal / superconducting ( n / s )  @xcite junctions have been investigated .    in this paper , we focus on the transport properties of a normal / ferromagnetic / normal ( n / f / n ) mos@xmath0 junction .",
    "we find , by using a modified dirac hamiltonian and the scattering formalism , that this structure produces the polarizations of the valley and the spin in the right n region .",
    "the polarizations can be tuned by changing the chemical potential of the n and f regions , @xmath6 , by means of a gate voltage , and the exchange field of the f region , @xmath7 . in particular",
    ", we find that the current through this junction is fully valley- and spin - polarized for a selected range of the chemical potential and furthermore , the polarizations can be inverted by reversing the direction of the exchange field . in addition , we demonstrate that the topological term ( @xmath1 ) in the hamiltonian of mos@xmath0 results in an enhancement or a reduction of the charge conductance , depending on the value of the exchange field .",
