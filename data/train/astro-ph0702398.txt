    "supra - parsec - scale transport of astrophysical jets has been a puzzle for a long time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and substantial efforts have been devoted , both theoretically and observationally , to solve their extremely stable feature ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "according to the first principle analysis @xcite , the outflows driven by a central engine are expected to carry a huge current that could reach @xmath1 and more ( for the jet of 3c273 , see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is known that reflecting the interplay between the beam and the self - generated azimuthal magnetic field , the net current is inhibited @xcite . the upper limit associated with a unit current",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lorentz factor of an electron ( or positron ) flow .",
    "apparently , here there is the serious difficulty that the current of jets greatly exceeds @xmath4 for conceivable @xmath5-values .",
    "one possible idea to overcome this is to make the cluster of current filaments , each having a current below @xmath4 , carry such a huge current @xcite .",
    "this situation might be accomplished via the current filamentation instability ( cfi ) including the weibel mode ( cf . * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the perfect conductivity characteristic of plasma calls the total return current equal to the outgoing current , likely arranging a pattern of the counterstreaming currents , which could serve as a free - energy source to amplify the perturbed magnetic fields transverse to the currents .",
    "in an environment with body - wave perturbations unstable for such an electromagnetic mode , a two - stream instability for longitudinal electrostatic perturbations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could simultaneously develop , although this is considered not to play an essential role in establishing the clustered current system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , highly self - organized filaments are certainly confirmed in many radio sources , for example the galactic centre @xcite , cyga @xcite , m87 @xcite , 3c353 @xcite , 3c273 @xcite and 3c438 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has recently been suggested that the filamentary jet model @xcite could reproduce the synchrotron x - ray spectra observed in extragalactic jets @xcite .",
    "long - scale jets have narrow opening angles less than @xmath6 , although in close proximity to the central engine the angles tend to significantly spread ( e.g. @xmath7 for the m87 jet ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there is a consensus that the internal pressure of the jets is higher than the external pressure : for example , 4c32.69 @xcite , cyga @xcite and m87 @xcite .",
    "it is implied that the jets are self - collimating . in a promising case where the outgoing currents are collimated by the self - generated magnetic fields , the magnetic pressure exerts to preferentially evacuate the plasma return currents radially outward @xcite .",
    "the resulting radial expansion might be pronounced for the plasma around the envelope of the filament cluster , because of the lower external pressure .",
    "as shown by the observational facts , a portion of the evacuated flows can constitute a halo surrounding jet ( e.g. 1803 + 784 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , filamentary back streams ( 3c84 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a cocoon ( mrk3 , @xcite ; 3c273 , @xcite ; cyga , @xcite ) , and so on .",
    "importantly , as a result of the continuous evacuation , the vacuum regions could appear to mediate the beam and return currents @xcite : the velocity shear - free configuration is likely established .",
    "then , the surface mode instability driven by the excess kinetic energy of the shear flows is not crucial .",
    "however , if the fractional return current remains in the beam core , the instability driven by the counterstreaming currents , such as the hose instability for kink - type perturbations , can grow .",
    "the eigenfunction is peaked near the surface , involving , for example , for a simple beam with rectangular radial density profile , the collective resonance with the beam electrons undergoing betatron oscillation ( cf .",
    "section 5.1 ) . in this sense , the hose instability might also be classified into the surface mode instability .",
    "the bulk mode instabilities leading to sausage- or hollowing - like deformation of beam @xcite are ignored here , to isolate the axially asymmetric modulation .",
    "the beam kinetic energy tends to be , in part , converted to transverse thermal energy via collisionless processes @xcite , whereupon the pressure equilibrium is hydrodynamically determined by the transverse dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the conventional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) description ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is insufficient for the stability analysis , as it averages out the betatron oscillation of beam particles , merely remaining an averaged flow velocity .",
    "if any , the cold return plasma that comprises gyrating particles can be modelled as an mhd fluid ( including the negligible effects of particle inertia ) . however , note that , in realistic situations , the energy flux of beams is expected to be larger than that of the return flows , such that the beam dynamics dominantly influences the evolution of the entire system . as a consequence , for a collisionless , isolating beam ( surrounded by the vacuum ) the vlasov equation is found to be adequate for resolving the wave ",
    "beam particle interaction . in a fluid - like way",
    ", the beam column appears to be stable for the velocity shear - free configuration .",
    "it is also noted that macroscopic dynamics of the cluster of filaments could deviate from that of a uniformly filled cylinder described by the fluid equation , as the filaments are electromagnetically decoupled , retaining the coherence of the betatron orbital motion ( reflected in the beam structure ) . according to the kinetic simulations of asymmetric counterstreaming currents ( reflecting the energy flux budget mentioned above ) , indeed , the mutual coupling of filaments seems likely to be poor in the fully developed non - linear phase of the cfi ( except for a peculiar phase of rapid coalescence of filaments ) , owing to the return current sheath @xcite . in another regime in which filamentary turbulence is well correlated all over the system ( larger than the amplitude of the betatron oscillation and the gyroradius ) , the kinetic analysis could provide a microscopic basis for the macroscopic fluid approach particularly involving an anomalous resistivity for the filamentary medium @xcite .",
    "however , one should notice the crucial point that the collective wave  particle resonance possibly gives rise to a morphologic catastrophe in the non - linear phase ; this is sheer unpredictable in the fluid context .    in this aspect",
    ", the recurrence of the pioneering kinetic analysis by @xcite may be useful for studying the fundamental transport property , although their argument was limited to be of a stability check of the electron beam ( without positrons ) produced in the laboratory .",
    "the key consequence is that for the self - collimating electron beam with a diffuse radial density profile reflecting the so - called bennett pinch equilibrium @xcite , the resonant divergence of a growth rate is removed , in contrast to the aforementioned simple case with a rectangular profile .",
    "related to this , the kinetic simulations @xcite reproduced the self - organization of a bennett - like profile @xcite .",
    "thus , the stable ( or quasi - stable ) transport of self - collimating flows is anticipated to be realized in various situations exhibiting similarity .",
    "in particular , for an application of their analysis to astrophysical jets , it is very important to take account of the positron abundance effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  bllacs @xcite , m87 @xcite and 3c279 @xcite  whose details have not substantially been investigated so far .    in this paper , the vlasov ",
    "maxwell analysis of resistive hose instability , which was briefly introduced in @xcite , is expanded to systematically survey the possible unstable modes involved in the relativistic electron ",
    "positron flows with a bennett - type profile and , for comparison , the rectangular profile . in the astrophysical context , the focus here is on highlighting some noticeable features of pair production effects , rather than a parameter survey such as was performed by @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the charge screening effects by positrons directly lower the betatron frequency to suppress the linear growth of the convective mode .",
    "the lowered betatron frequency appears to be reflected in the expansion of the filament radius , which prolongs the resistive decay time of the perturbed current , to suppress the growth of the absolute mode ; whereupon for the bennett profile case , the spatial growth distance can be safely longer than ( or comparable to ) the observational length - scale of astrophysical jets . for this case , for convenience ,",
    "the scaling of the growth distance in the relevant plasma - parameter region is explicitly shown .    in order to present these details in a straightforward way",
    ", this paper has been organized as follows . in section  2 , an ad hoc model of negatively charged electron ",
    "positron gas is introduced .",
    "for the relativistic flows , in section  3 the equilibria of the momentum distribution functions and self - generated magnetic fields are constructed for the cases of the rectangular density profile ( section  3.1 ) and bennett profile ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "then , in section  4 , the vlasov ",
    "maxwell equations are linearized around the equilibria . using the procedure outlined in appendix ,",
    "the eigenvalue equations are derived from the linearized equation , to extract the relevant eigenmodes in section  5 , for the cases of the rectangular ( section  5.1 ) and bennett ( section  5.2 ) profiles .",
    "section  6 is devoted to a discussion concerning mode preference in actual circumstances , and a summary .",
    "the extreme astrophysical environments , in which electron  positron pairs are created , can be typically found in galactic nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ; for a laboratory experiment , see @xcite ) . as a rule",
    ", the charge conservation law requires that the total electron charge is compensated by the pair - created positrons and discharged ions , such that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the total electron , positron and ion densities , respectively , and @xmath12 is the average of the charge state of a composite .",

    "reflecting the characteristic of perfect conductivity in plasma , the return currents are allowed to flow outside the beams , and even the jet ( for modeling , cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the present purpose , the fractional beam density , defined as the ratio of the beam electron ( positron ) density to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , is assumed to be constant [ i.e. @xmath21 , whereby the fractional return flow density is given by @xmath22 .",

    "we consider the situation that the electron  positron gas flowing in the @xmath31-direction has the speed of @xmath32 and the gas flowing in the opposite direction has the speed of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and these have the thermal energy of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "similarly , the effective temperature is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath35 , @xmath43 . for the special case , @xmath44 , reflecting that the plasma return current is perfectly evacuated outside the beam core ( section  1 ) , equations  ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) reduce to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the definitions given by equations  ( [ eq:2])([eq:4 ] ) are substantially used throughout .",

    "the superimposition of @xmath328 yields different effects : shifting the range of @xmath329 corresponding to instability relative to the @xmath330 case , and expanding the bandwidth @xmath331 of the instability in the @xmath30-space @xcite .",
    "it appears that these effects are not significant enough to disturb the reasoning that the convective mode must be somehow strongly suppressed or stabilized in the actual system .    in conclusion ,",
    "a full derivation has been given of the eigenvalue equation for the kink - type perturbations superimposed on the relativistic electron  positron beam with the modified bennett and rectangular profiles .",
    "the dispersion relations have been examined for the convective and absolute modes of the resistive hose instability .",

    ", we found @xmath335 , implying that the convective growth is dominant , although its enormously rapid evolution , which ought to disrupt jets , appears to be incompatible with the observational facts because of the possible interpretation given above .",
