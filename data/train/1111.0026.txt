    ", it was proposed that our universe is five dimensional , described by the metric @xmath2 the extra dimension y makes a finite contribution to the 5d volume because of the exponential warp factor , where @xmath3 is the size of the extra dimension . at low energies , gravity is localized at the brane and general relativity is recovered . at high energy gravity `` leaks '' into the bulk",
    ". the 4d planck scale will be an effective scale which can become much larger than the fundamental planck scale @xmath4 if the extra dimension is much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "further , the self - gravity of the brane must be incorporated .",
    "this will protect the 3 dimensional space from the large extra dimensions by curvature rather than straightforward compactification . also matter fields in the bulk",
    "can be incorporated .",
    "this will lead to a kind of `` holographic '' principle , i.e. , the 5d dynamics may be determined from knowledge of the fields on the 4d boundary . for an overview ,",
    ". we will consider here the 5d model with a general yang - mills field , dependent of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in a following article",
    "we investigate the interplay of the 4d and 5d coupled equations with the junction conditions .",

    "we will consider here only the 5d equation in a general setting and with a yang - mills matter field .",
    "the 4d induced equations together with the junction conditions will be presented in part 2 of a next article .",

    "this oscillatory behavior of @xmath82 is not uncommon for gravitating ym vortices .",
    "so it seems to be possible to find the desired asymptotic warped form for the conical space time , i.e. , eq.(33 ) .",
    "the next task is to obtain from the junction condition and the brane - bulk splitting , relations between the several constants in the model .",
    "for a given set of initial conditions , these pde s determine the behavior of f , a , w and @xmath39 .",

    "in earlier attempts@xcite , we tried to build a 5-dimensional cosmic string without a warp factor and investigated the causal structure .",
    "here we considered a different approach .",
    "it seems possible that the absence of cosmic strings in observational data could be explained by our model , where the effective angle - deficit resides in the bulk and not in the brane . in this part we considered the 5d equations in general form , without the splitting of the energy - momentum tensor in a bulk and brane part .",
    "we find a consistent set of equations in the bulk .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the metric outside the core of the string seems to have the desired form .",
    "this solution must be consistent with the system of equations obtained by the bulk - brane splitting .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate holographic ideas in our model .",
