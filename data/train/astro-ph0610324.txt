    "pg1159 stars are hot hydrogen - deficient pre - wds which are believed to be the outcome of a late ( or very late ) helium - shell flash . their non - standard evolutionary history , including a second passing through post - agb stages , is reflected in their unusual surface composition",
    "( see also @xcite ) which is characterized by strong hydrogen - depletion .",
    "spectroscopic masses have in the past usually been derived from hydrogen - rich models , using the sets by @xcite and and @xcite .",
    "the derivation of spectroscopic masses requires to obtain accurate photospheric parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and combine them with evolutionary model calulations .",
    "the most comprehensive compilation , using nlte stellar atmosphere on the one hand and actual late helium - shell flash modelling on the other hand , has recently been presented by @xcite , collecting together a total of 40 objects in their analysis .",
    "a further set of state - of - the - art evolutionary tracks has simultaneously been presented by .",
    "both finally make available late thermal pulse post - agb evolutionary models , but differ in details on which mass track actually corresponds to a given position in @xmath0 , @xmath1 diagrams .",
    "a complementary approach uses the fact that ten of the currently known pg1159 stars lie in the gw  vir instability strip ( for the current status of work trying to theoretically and empirically constrain the red and blue edges of the gw  vir instability strip , see the contributions by @xcite ) . from an analysis of the gw  vir stars pulsational eigenmodes , fundamental parameters including",
    "the mass can be derived through comparison to structural models ( usually requiring some additional spectroscopic information to narrow down the number of possible solutions ) . such solutions have been found for five objects so far ( table  [ tabpulsators ] ) .    lcclll star & m@xmath2&m@xmath3&m@xmath4&p@xmath5&reference + pg2131 + 066 & 0.58 & 0.61 & 0.006 & 0.21 & @xcite + pg0122 + 200 & 0.58 & 0.59 & & 1.66 & fu et al .",

    "ngc  246 has long been known to be one component in a wide pair , but at a separation of 38 from its companion , an observation of the dynamical aspect of their orbit is out of reach .",
    "it is still very useful , though , as the distance to the system and surrounding planetary nebula could be derived from photometry of the companion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been claimed to be pulsating ( ) .",
    "yet another pulsator , pg2131 + 066 , was found to show an 3.9h periodicity , in addition to the shorter pulsational photometric variations , by , who attributed this to orbital motion in a close binary .",
    "the close binary hypothesis was supported by the observation of a red excess @xcite and h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 emission superimposed on the pg1159 spectrum , but was disputed by @xcite , who measure a physical companion 03 away from the primary in hst wfpc1 images and argue that the emission is caused by that farther - away companion alone . the claim that pg2131 + 066 resides in a close binary therefore remains unconfirmed",
    ".    the only other pg1159 star known to be part of a binary system is the recently discovered , and it is finally without doubt also a close one , i.e.  suitable for dynamical mass determination .",
    "@xcite systematically searched sdss archival data for wd+ms companion candidates and discovered h@xmath7 emission and a red colour excess in sdssj212531.92@xmath6010745.9 .",
    "the candidate was further analysed by ; we briefly recapitulate their main results below .      to fit a composite spectrum to the sdss data ,",
    "the model grid and fitting method described by @xcite has been employed , but a more complex iterative procedure was required to account for the contribution of the secondary . as the latter was realized as a simple black - body contribution , the best - fit composite ( @xmath9k , @xmath10 = 7.6 $ ] for the pg1159 component ) obviously fails to reproduce the emission line features . in the pg1159 spectrum , is furthermore too weak in the model .",
    "this only reinforces , however , the identification as a genuine pg1159 star , and prompted to secure time - series photometry of the object in the 2005 observing season .",
    "the light curve of sdssj212531.92@xmath6010745.9 shows photometric variability with a period of 6.9h and a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.7mmag .",
    "the 6.9h periodicity is interpreted as the orbital period of the system .",
    "a profile is obtained by folding the observations with this period .",
    "it shows no eclipses ( this constrains the inclination in the light curve solution ) , a flat part , and periodic brightening that is attributed to the light contribution by the irradiated side of the cool companion .",
    "collecting together spectroscopic parameters , reasonable assumptions , photometric observations , and performing a fit to the folded profile with the ` nightfall ` program , arrived at one possible system solution as presented in table  [ tablightcurve ] .",
    "a key parameter of interest , the mass of the primary , will however have to await radial velocity measurements for an independent determination .",
    "the light curve does not suggest the presence of pulsations in the pg1159 star , but the constraints to exclude pulsations are weak : the existing data exclude pulsations with amplitudes above 50mmag at periods longer than about 8min .",
