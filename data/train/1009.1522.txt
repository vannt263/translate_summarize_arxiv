    ", the set of all critical values of @xmath25 , which we denote by @xmath26 , has received a lot of attention , because this is an interesting object which contains a lot of information on the matrix @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , it is known that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , there exists a real algebraic curve @xmath29 with the property that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the set of all line segments joining pairs of points of @xmath32 at which @xmath32 has the same tangent line @xcite . under generic assumptions on @xmath4 ,",
    "the bitangent set @xmath31 is empty , and the critical set @xmath33 is therefore the union of a finite number of closed curves , one of which is the boundary of the numerical range @xmath18 .",

    "our purpose in this paper is to introduce another mathematical quantity which is naturally related to the numerical map @xmath25 . given @xmath0 , the _ numerical measure _ of @xmath4 is the probability measure @xmath1 on @xmath34 defined by the formula @xmath35 for all continuous functions @xmath36 . here",

    "this is precisely the reason why we used the euclidean measure on @xmath38 in the definition .",
    "it is also easy to verify that the support of @xmath1 is exactly the numerical range @xmath18 , see section  [ s : general ] below .",
    "less obvious , perhaps , is the fact that @xmath1 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath43 on @xmath18 , so that we can define the _ numerical density _ @xmath5 as the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath43 ( in the particular situation where @xmath18 reduces to a line segment @xmath44 , we understand @xmath43 as the one - dimensional lebesgue measure on @xmath44 , see section  [ s : general ] . )",
    "we also prove that the numerical density @xmath5 is strictly positive in the interior of @xmath4 , a property that can be interpreted as a strong version of hausdorff s theorem @xcite .",

    "after these general properties have been established , our next goal is to give a more precise description of the numerical density @xmath5 .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to distinguish between various cases :    * 1 . *",
    "( _ the scalar case _ ) if @xmath18 is reduced to a single point @xmath47 , then @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 denotes the identity matrix ) and @xmath50 . in this trivial situation , there is of course no need to introduce a numerical density .",
    "( _ the hermitian case _ ) assume that @xmath51 and that @xmath52 is a line segment",

    "this gives an explicit representation of the numerical measure @xmath58 , and the measure @xmath1 is the image of @xmath58 under the affine isometry @xmath69 .",

    ", one can show that @xmath5 is continuous together with its derivatives up to order @xmath74 ( and is discontinuous on @xmath75 if @xmath76 . )",
    "( _ the nonnormal case _ ) finally , we consider the most interesting situation where the matrix @xmath77 is not normal . in that case",
    ", there is no explicit formula for the numerical density , but the problem can be reduced in some sense to the hermitian case by the following simple observation . for any @xmath78 , let @xmath79 be the hermitian matrix defined by @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "now , if the random variable @xmath39 is uniformly distributed on @xmath38 , the distribution of @xmath85 is by definition the numerical measure @xmath86 , whereas the distribution of @xmath87 is easily identified as the two - dimensional _ radon transform _ of the numerical measure @xmath1 , evaluated at @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "we thus have @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the two - dimensional radon transformation .",
    "since the numerical density of @xmath79 is known to be the @xmath6-spline based on the eigenvalues @xmath91 of @xmath79 , we can reconstruct the numerical measure @xmath1 by inverting the radon transformation in , using the the well - known _ backprojection _ method which plays an important role in tomography @xcite .",
    "this provides a useful representation formula for the numerical density , as well as an efficient algorithm for numerical calculations , see section  [ s : radon ] for more details .",

    "this remarkable property of the numerical density , which is one of our main results , will be established in section  [ ss : poly ] .",
    "the geometric condition @xmath106 is always satisfied in the complement of the numerical range , where @xmath5 vanishes identically , but for many matrices of size @xmath70 is it also met in some regions inside @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , in the three - dimensional example represented in fig.[fig1 ] , it is easy to verify that @xmath107 if @xmath102 is outside @xmath18 or inside the cuspidal triangle , and @xmath108 in the intermediate region where the numerical density is not constant .    [",

    "in that situation @xmath112 , where @xmath32 is the set of all vertices and @xmath31 the set of all edges of the triangle .",
    "in this section , we study the numerical measure from a statistical point of view , and we establish various convergence results which show that the measure @xmath1 of a large matrix @xmath0 is concentrated in a neighborhood of the barycenter of the spectrum @xmath15 .      [",
