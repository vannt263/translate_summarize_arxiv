    "the static critical behaviors of the @xmath0 model in two and three dimensions ( 2d and 3d ) have been studied for more than 20 years and there exists well - established consensus on the nature of the phase transitions and the values of the critical exponents .",
    "@xcite for example , static universal properties have been well established where the static exponents do not depend on details of models . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamic universality class has still not been completely sorted out .",
    "@xcite    the usual @xmath0 model , where the spins are two dimensional , has been found to have dynamic critical exponents @xmath5 that seem to depend both on the dynamic model used and on the quantity measured.@xcite in 2d most of the existing works have obtained the result that @xmath6 at the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition  @xcite temperature @xmath9 and that @xmath5 increases as the temperature @xmath10 is lowered below @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite however , the result that @xmath6 in the whole low - temperature phase has also been found .",
    "@xcite in 3d , on the other hand , there is a growing consensus that the dynamic critical exponent @xmath5 associated with voltage ( or phase slip ) fluctuations is @xmath11 ( refs .  )",
    "although a rigorous analytic justification is still lacking .",
    "furthermore this appears to be the case even for relaxational dynamics in spite of the fact that @xmath6 has been concluded from the standard dynamic renormalization group method ( for example , in ref .  ) in accordance with model a in the hohenberg - halperin classification.@xcite    the variant of the @xmath0 model , which we study here , is given by a hamiltonian of the same form as the usual @xmath0 model but where the spins are three dimensional [ we call this the classical heisenberg spin @xmath0 model ( chs@xmath0 ) to avoid confusion with the usual @xmath0 model ] .",
    "this model has previously been studied subject to the so - called `` spin dynamics.''@xcite although the chs@xmath0 model belongs to the same static universality class as the @xmath0 model both in 2d ( ref .  ) and 3d ( ref .  ) , studies of spin dynamics for the chs@xmath0 model have given @xmath12 in 2d ,  @xcite which differs significantly from @xmath6 in the @xmath0 model .",
    "in 3d , while ref .   has found @xmath11 , the possibility of a breakdown of the dynamic scaling has been suggested , i.e. , that @xmath5 is not unique but has different values @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the decay of correlations in the in - plane and the out - of - plane directions , respectively .",
    "@xcite    we here propose a variant of the chs@xmath0 model where the spherical coordinates of the spins are taken as the dynamic variables with a uniform measure in phase space , and investigate the dynamic critical behaviors of the model in two and three dimensions subject to relaxational dynamics instead of spin dynamics .",
    "relaxational dynamics belongs to the model a with the expected value @xmath15 in the hohenberg - halperin classification .",
    "@xcite however , this value does not always seem to be guaranteed .",
    "for example , the purely relaxational form of dynamics applied to the @xmath0 model in 3d under the fluctuating twist boundary condition has been found to give @xmath16 ( ref .  ) .",
    "even the monte carlo ( mc ) dynamics simulations , which are generally believed to correspond to relaxational dynamics , for the 3d @xmath0 model with both phase  @xcite and vortex  @xcite representation have also led to @xmath16 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the hamiltonian of the chs@xmath0 model in the spherical coordinate representation and the corresponding equations of motion for the relaxational dynamics are introduced .",
    "although our main interests are in dynamic critical behaviors we also perform monte carlo simulations in sec .",

    "[ sec : rd ] , which constitutes the main results of the current work .",

    "[ sec : sum ] for summary and discussions .",
    "we begin with the hamiltonian of the conventional chs@xmath0 model in the @xmath17-dimensional hypercubic geometry with size @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the linear size ) , @xmath20 = -j\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle}(s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the coupling strength , the summation is over all nearest - neighbor pairs , and the three - dimensional local spin @xmath22 at site @xmath23 has unit length ( @xmath24 ) , or equivalently the partition function should include the measure @xmath25 $ ] . the chs@xmath0 model with the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hxy ] ) can be viewed as either an extension from the original @xmath0 model where spins are two dimensional , or as a special case of the heisenberg @xmath26 model with couplings only in the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane .",
    "the more convenient representation of the conventional chs@xmath0 hamiltonian is written as @xmath29 = -j\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\sqrt{[1-(s_i^z)^2][1-(s_j^z)^2 ] } \\cos(\\phi_i - \\phi_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath30 has been used , and @xmath31 is the angle between the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane component of the spin @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , and the positive @xmath27 axis . in representation  ( [ eq : hzphi ] ) , @xmath2 and @xmath34 have uniform measure since @xmath35 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\int ds^z \\int rdr \\int d\\phi \\delta [ r^2 + ( s^z)^2 - 1 ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\propto & \\int_{-1}^1 ds_z \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi d\\phi ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the identity @xmath38 has been used .",
    "we introduce the polar angle variable @xmath1 in the spherical coordinate system as follows : @xmath39 which then leads to the representation @xmath40 =   -j\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\sin\\theta_i \\sin\\theta_j \\cos(\\phi_i - \\phi_j).\\ ] ] we then simplify the conventional chs@xmath0 model and use the _ uniform _ measure not only for @xmath2 but also for @xmath1 variables .",
    "one advantage of this is that no additional constraint is required since @xmath41 = 1 is satisfied automatically in the representation  ( [ eq : htp ] ) .",
    "one should note that the conventional chs@xmath0 model [ represented by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hzphi ] ) with the uniform measure in @xmath34 and @xmath2 ] and its variant model studied in this work [ the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htp ] ) with the uniform measure in @xmath1 and @xmath2 ]  @xcite do not have the same partition function and free energy , and accordingly some nonuniversal properties like the critical temperature can be different .",

    "( [ eq : htp ] ) . in other words , the relaxational dynamics used in this work automatically produces equilibrium fluctuations in time , which are compatible with the boltzmann distribution of the same hamiltonian . in this respect ,",
    "the initial configuration of the relaxational dynamics can be chosen arbitrarily ; the equilibrium fluctuations are generated by the dynamics itself as the system evolves in time .",
    "this is in contrast to the widely used spin dynamics , where the initial configurations must be generated according to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "otherwise the spin dynamics will not reflect the properties of the equilibrium .",
    "consequently , the relaxational dynamics described here is consistent with the usual physical situation of a system in contact with a thermal reservoir .",
    "from this perspective we believe that the relaxational dynamics can phenomenologically catch relevant features for a real spin system in a situation where the thermal effects are strong .",
    "for completeness we start by calculating the static properties from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations within the spherical coordinate ( @xmath51 ) representation with both variables uniformly distributed , which we have not found in the literature .",
    "we use the standard metropolis algorithm applied to the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htp ] ) , and the variations of @xmath52 and @xmath31 at each mc try are tuned to give an acceptance ratio of about 1/2 near the critical temperature .",
    "later we will compare the mc results with those from the relaxational dynamics in sec .",
