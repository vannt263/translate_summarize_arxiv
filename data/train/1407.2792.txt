    "the problem studied in this paper is the behavior of the 2d euler equations in a porous medium .",
    "although very natural , this problem was studied in very few mathematical papers .",
    "most papers have focused on the laplace equation @xcite , on stokes and navier - stokes flows @xcite .",
    "recently , more attention was given to the homogenization of other fluid models such as the compressible navier - stokes system @xcite and the acoustic system @xcite .",
    "concerning the incompressible euler system , noticeable exceptions are the works @xcite , on a weakly nonlinear euler flow through a regular grid ( balls of radius @xmath0 , at distance @xmath0 from one another ) . in this context",
    ", a non - trivial limit is obtained as @xmath0 goes to zero .    in the spirit of @xcite where the limit was studied for holes which are larger or smaller than the critical sizes of the holes , we have obtained in @xcite a condition such that the ideal incompressible fluid does not feel the presence of the small inclusions .",
    "our goal here is to complete the study started in @xcite .",
    "we improve the critical distance obtained in @xcite and we prove that below this distance an impermeable boundary appears .",
    "when the inclusions are distributed in one direction , an important difference with the result about the stokes and laplace equations is that the critical value depends on the shape of the inclusions and corresponds to very close inclusions ( at distance @xmath8 for disks distributed on a segment whereas the inclusions are separated by @xmath9 in @xcite ) .",
    "even if physically , it appears natural that the critical distance for a viscous fluid is larger than for an inviscid flow , it was not clear mathematically because the euler equations is related to a laplace problem @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vorticity ( which is bounded ) and @xmath12 the stream function : the velocity verifying @xmath13 .",
    "of course , the main difference lies in the boundary condition .",
    "we denote the shape of the inclusions by @xmath14 and the standard assumption is :    ( h1 ) : :    @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] is a simply - connected compact set of    @xmath16 such that    @xmath17 for @xmath18 is    a jordan curve .",
    "we consider the case where the inclusions have the same shape : @xmath19 where the points @xmath20 should be fixed in order that the inclusions are disjoints .",
    "we assume that the inclusions of size @xmath0 are at least separated by a distance @xmath1 .",
    "namely , for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we define @xmath23    in the horizontal direction , we consider the maximal number of inclusions that we can distribute on the unit segment @xmath24 $ ] ( see figure  [ fig.config ] ) , hence we consider @xmath25 with @xmath26\\ ] ] ( where @xmath27 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath28 ) .        in the vertical direction , we will consider two situations :    * inclusions covering the unit square , namely @xmath29 * inclusions concentrated on the unit segment , namely @xmath30    when the obstacles are distributed only in one direction , the critical distance will be much smaller than the size , and the geometry of the lateral boundaries of the inclusion will play a crucial role .",
    "we assume that the distance between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is reached for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath35 , which implies that the distance between two inclusions is @xmath36 : @xmath37 of course , we could replace this condition by @xmath38 , for some @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "we recall that if the boundary @xmath40 is locally parametrized around @xmath41 by @xmath42 with @xmath43 , then @xmath44 is called the tangency exponent in @xcite . more generally , let us assume that    ( h2 ) : :    there exist @xmath45 ,    @xmath46 and    @xmath6 $ ] such that    +    * the segment    @xmath47\\times\\{s\\}\\subset \\k$ ]    for all @xmath48 $ ] ;    * the set    @xmath49\\times\\{s\\}$ ]    for all @xmath39 $ ] .    in particular , ( h2 )",
    "encodes the fact that @xmath35 , which will be used when the inclusions are distributed on the segment . for inclusions covering the square ,",
    "our main result is independent of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath44 , but we will need @xmath52 ( see section  [ sect shape ] for possible extensions ) .    for example , if the inclusion is the unit ball , @xmath53 is locally parametrized around @xmath41 by @xmath54 , i.e. we can choose in this case @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 ) .",
    "note that @xmath57 corresponds to the case where the solid is flat near @xmath58 : @xmath59\\subset \\partial \\k$ ] .",
    "let us note that @xmath44 does not correspond to the radius of curvature @xmath60 : for @xmath61 the radius @xmath62 , for @xmath63 $ ] we have @xmath64 , and for @xmath65 we compute @xmath66 .    throughout the paper , the fluid domain will be the exterior of the inclusions : @xmath67 or @xmath68      the velocity @xmath69 of an ideal incompressible fluid filling a domain @xmath70 is governed by the euler equations @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the pressure . in dimension two ,",
    "the natural quantity for these equations is the vorticity : @xmath73 because taking formally the curl of , we note that @xmath74 verifies a transport equation : @xmath75    in smooth domains , the well - posedness of the euler equations was established long time ago : the existence and uniqueness of global strong solution for smooth initial data is a result of wolibner @xcite , whereas the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions for initial data with bounded vorticity was obtained by yudovich @xcite ( see kikuchi @xcite for exterior domains ) .    to fix an initial data for all @xmath0 ,",
    "the standard way is to fix an initial vorticity @xmath76 ( i.e. @xmath77 bounded and compactly supported ) and to consider the unique initial velocity @xmath78 such that : @xmath79    _ the goal of this article is to determine the limit of the euler solutions when @xmath0 and @xmath80 tend to zero .",
    "more precisely , depending on the distribution of the inclusions , we prove the convergence to the solution of euler in the whole plane , in the exterior of the unit segment or in the exterior of the unit square .",
    "_    the asymptotic behavior of the euler equations around inclusions which shrink to points was the subject of several recent works : the case of one shrinking obstacle in the whole plane @xcite , of one shrinking obstacle in a bounded domain @xcite , of an infinite number of shrinking disks @xcite .",
    "in all these works , the authors have also treated the case where the initial circulations are non zero , which adds some difficulties and provides interesting asymptotics . nevertheless , in all these cases",
    "the distance between the obstacles is large , and if the initial circulations are zero , the theorems therein can be understood by stating that the limit motion is not perturbed by the shrinking inclusions .      in @xcite",
    "we have looked for the distances @xmath81 between obstacles ( @xmath82 ) for which we do not feel the presence of the inclusions .",
    "we have proved therein that for @xmath83 when inclusions cover the square and for @xmath84 when inclusions are distributed in one direction , then the solutions @xmath85 of the euler equations on @xmath86 with initial velocity @xmath87 converge to the unique global solution to the euler equations in the whole plane @xmath16 , with initial vorticity @xmath77 .    when inclusions cover the square , the first goal of this paper is to observe , for @xmath88 , the presence of an impermeable square at the limit , i.e. we get @xmath89 on the boundary of the square , no matter what the geometry of the inclusions is .",
    "when inclusions are distributed on the segment , we will prove in the second theorem that the critical value of @xmath90 depends on the geometry : @xmath91 for instance :    * if inclusions are asymptotically vertically flat ( @xmath57 in ( h2 ) ) , an impermeable segment appears for @xmath92 ; * for circular inclusions , we prove the impermeability of the porous medium for @xmath93 and prove permeability for @xmath94 improving the analysis performed in @xcite .",
    "a main novelty of this work is to show that the critical distance depends on the geometry of the inclusions ( in the case of a segment ) , which is not the case for the laplace , stokes and navier - stokes problems .",
    "another slight improvement compared to @xcite , included here , is to consider more general @xmath36 than power of @xmath0 .",
    "this requires us to be more precise and not even losing some @xmath95 in some of the estimates in section  [ sec : permeability ] .",
    "when the inclusions cover a square , the criterion is independent of the geometry :    [ main2 ] assume that @xmath14 verifies ( h1 ) .",
    "let @xmath76 and @xmath85 be the global weak solution to the euler equations - on @xmath96 with initial vorticity @xmath97 and initial circulations @xmath98 around the inclusions ( see ) .    1 .   if @xmath99 then * @xmath100 strongly in @xmath101 and @xmath102 weak @xmath103 in @xmath104 ; * the limit pair @xmath105 is the unique global solution to the euler equations in the whole plane @xmath16 , with initial vorticity @xmath77 .",

    "the tangency condition is verified where @xmath113 is defined , i.e. on the boundary of the square except the corners : for all @xmath114 . let us note that it does not imply that the velocity vanishes at the corners , because the velocity may blow up near the corners ( see remark  [ rem grisvard ] for more details ) .    the situation @xmath115 is related to the problem considered in @xcite . in these works , the authors considered the case where the inclusions cover a bounded domain @xmath116 with @xmath117 . as there are inclusions everywhere in the fluid domain",
    ", they have assumed that the velocity is small @xmath118 and studied the limit when @xmath119 verifies a weakly non - linear equation @xmath120 using the notion of two - scale convergence , they obtained that the limit of @xmath119 verifies an homogenized system which couples a cell problem with the macroscopic one .",
    "when the inclusions are distributed only in one direction , the critical distance is much smaller than the size , and depends on the exponent @xmath44 of the lateral boundaries of the obstacle .",

    "this solution is unique and we do not need to extract a subsequence .    unfortunately , the uniqueness result is a hard issue in the exterior of the square or the segment , because in such domains , the velocity does not belong to @xmath131 .",
    "actually , @xmath132 is not even bounded and blows up in the vicinity of the corners ( like @xmath133 close to the endpoints of the segment and like @xmath134 close to the corners of a square ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for partial results in this setting .",

    "this is natural because the distance is much smaller than the size of the holes .    for the laplace , stokes and navier - stokes problem in dimension two with dirichlet boundary condition , the critical criterion separating between impermeability and permeability is whether @xmath144 goes to @xmath145 or @xmath98 when inclusions cover a bounded domain @xmath116 and whether @xmath146 goes to @xmath145 or @xmath98 when they are distributed in one direction . for these systems ,",

    "choosing the cutoff function which minimize the @xmath151 norm of the gradient ( see remark  [ rem : cutoff ] ) , we find @xmath152 with @xmath153 if the inclusions are distributed on a surface and @xmath154 for a distribution on a curve . therefore , for inclusions covering a bounded domain @xmath116 and",
    "when @xmath155 , we obtain at the limit an homogenized system : see cioranescu - murat @xcite for the laplace equation and allaire @xcite for the stokes and navier - stokes systems . if @xmath156 , allaire has proved in @xcite that the limit is not perturbed by the porous medium , and he has also proved the homogenized phenomenon ( a brinkmann - type law ) when @xmath157 for inclusions distributed on a curve .",
    "let us note that the case @xmath158 for inclusions distributed on a curve is not treated by allaire @xcite . with smaller distance",
    "than the critical value , he only considered the case of inclusions covering a bounded domain @xmath116 , and as there are inclusions everywhere , the velocity is assumed small and he gets a limit for the quantity @xmath159 in order to pass to the limit in the term of the type @xmath160 in this setting , he obtained darcy s law at the limit .",
    "actually , allaire needs to assume that the size of the holes is still smaller than the inter - hole distance ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 3.4.2 ) ) ) , hence the case @xmath4 in our main results is also a novelty of the present paper and @xcite .",
    "for inclusions distributed on a curve , there are also many works in the periodic setting @xmath117 ( through grids , sieves or porous walls ) we refer e.g. to @xcite .",
    "the reminder of this paper is composed of four parts . in the following section ,",
    "we reduce our problem to a time - independent problem .",
    "first , we derive some a priori estimates which allow us to pass to the limit far away from the porous medium .",
    "next , we write two key propositions dealing with the behavior of divergence free vector fields in a porous medium .",
    "we will prove that these propositions imply theorems  [ main2 ] and [ main1 ] .",
    "the core of our analysis is the proof of these two propositions where the quantities @xmath161 ( for the square ) and @xmath162 ( for the segment ) will appear naturally as critical quantities to get permeability vs impermeability .    in section  [ sec :",
    "permeability ] , we prove proposition  [ prop : key1 ] concerning permeability for inclusions separated by large enough distances .",
    "we will follow therein the strategy in @xcite , which is somehow related to homogenization ideas .",
    "the cell problem is the exterior of one inclusion where the velocity verifies the tangency condition .",
    "we introduce and study a correction of the solution in the whole plane .",
    "this correction is based on the explicit green kernel formula in the exterior of one simply connected compact set , via riemann mappings .",
    "to localize our formula , we need to truncate the stream function by introducing some cutoff functions @xmath149 and we will discuss the optimal choice of @xmath149 .",
    "section  [ sec : impermeability ] deals with proposition  [ prop : key2 ] concerning impermeability for inclusions separated by small enough distances . to prove that a wall appears , the main point is to get the impermeability condition on the boundary of the porous medium .",
    "the approach is totally different from the permeability case . here",
    ", we use an @xmath151 argument and the computation of the area between two obstacles , which depends on the coefficient @xmath44 . indeed , for small distance",
    ", it makes sense , physically , that the fluid crosses easier between circular inclusions ( @xmath65 ) than between squares ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "finally , section  [ sect final ] is dedicated to further discussions .",
    "we will give some extensions on the inclusion geometry where our results hold .",
    "for instance , note that @xmath163 in ( h2 ) would correspond to the case where @xmath53 is a corner of angle @xmath164 , which would not verify @xmath165 .",
    "this case is not treated in the main theorems , and we refer to section  [ sect shape ] for a discussion about inclusions with corners .",
    "we do not treat the case of a cusp , where we could only take @xmath166 .",
    "section  [ sect final ] contains also a consequence on the leray projection : we deduce from our analysis that the leray projection is not uniformly continuous from @xmath167 to @xmath167 ( with @xmath168 ) in porous medium where @xmath169 .",
    "if it appears natural that the critical distance is smaller for ideal fluid than for viscous fluid , this is not so clear mathematically .",
    "we could argue that the euler equations and the laplace , stokes or navier - stokes problems are not at same order , but in practical , the velocity comes from a laplace problem @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the stream function , and we are looking for @xmath151 estimates of @xmath172 .",
    "then , we could think that the difference comes from the boundary condition and that the tangency and the zero circulation conditions are less restricting for ideal fluid than the dirichlet boundary condition for viscous fluid . nevertheless , this is not a sufficient justification : allaire showed in @xcite that the scaling is the same for navier - stokes equations for the two types of boundary conditions ( dirichlet / robin ) .",
    "we finish this introduction by referring to a recent result of lacave and mazzucato @xcite , where one considers the limit of the porous medium together with the vanishing viscosity problem .    _",
    "notations : _ throughout the paper , @xmath173 denotes the exterior domain when inclusions are distributed in the two directions whereas @xmath174 concerns the case of inclusions distributed in one direction .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath70 when an argument holds for both @xmath174 and @xmath173 . for shortness",
    ", we also denote the exterior of the unit square and of the unit segment by @xmath175 ^ 2 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad \\omega_{1}:= { { \\mathbb r}}^2 \\setminus ( [ 0,1]\\times \\ { 0\\}),\\ ] ] and @xmath176 for arguments holding for both .",
    "in this section , we derive some standard a priori estimates for solutions of the euler equations .",
    "next , we give the two key propositions and we prove that theorems  [ main2 ] and [ main1 ] will follow .",
    "let @xmath76 be given . by standard results related to the hodge - de rham theorem , there exists a unique vector fields @xmath177 verifying ( see e.g. @xcite for a proof in smooth domain and @xcite for any irregular domain ) .",

    "<S> if @xmath3 , then the limit motion is not perturbed by the porous medium , namely we recover the euler solution in the whole space . on the contrary , if @xmath4 , then the fluid can not penetrate the porous region , namely the limit velocity verifies the euler equations in the exterior of an impermeable square .    </S>",
    "<S> if the inclusions are distributed on the unit segment then the behavior depends on the geometry of the inclusion : it is determined by the limit of @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] is related to the geometry of the lateral boundaries of the obstacles . if @xmath7 , then the presence of holes is not felt at the limit , whereas an impermeable wall appears if this limit is zero . </S>",
