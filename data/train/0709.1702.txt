    "the experimental level structure of @xmath0cd ( see figs .  [ fig : levelscheme1 ] and  [ fig : levelscheme2 ] ) consists of three positive - parity sequences ( @xmath53 i - iii ) and a negative - parity band ( @xmath53 iv ) built on @xmath32 = 11/2@xmath30 state .",
    "meyer _ et al .",

    "@xcite , as well as in the present investigation , the unfavored signature partners have been observed .",
    "it is found that although the signature splitting is strong , the unfavored signature partners are still energetically lower than the corresponding next favored ones and hence the band is not completely decoupled .",
    "the experimental level energies of the negative - parity band are also found to be in close agreement with those of the corresponding levels of the ground state bands of @xmath56cd .",
    "this suggests that the excited negative - parity levels in @xmath0cd originate essentially due to the coupling of the 1@xmath17 neutron quasiparticle with the collective excitations of the @xmath58cd or @xmath21cd core . as such ,",
    "the observed negative - parity band is identified as a decoupled band arising from @xmath59 nilsson orbits with the fermi level lying near a low-@xmath25 orbital ( @xmath25 = 1/2 in the present case ) .    from the shell model point of view ,",

    "there are a large number of configurations belonging to the partitions [ @xmath67 .",
    "most of the states can be built in a variety of ways .",
    "therefore , the underlying structure of most of the levels is expected to consist of admixture of configurations of many multi - particle - hole excitations .",
    "this gives rise to a complex and irregular structure beyond the first 21/2@xmath28 state belonging to the energetically lowest configuration [ @xmath63 .",
    "for the positive parity levels with @xmath32 @xmath68 21/2@xmath28 , @xmath69 excitations are needed and they appear at @xmath70 4 mev .",
    "this can be estimated from the consideration of the single particle energies @xcite of the valence orbitals and the expected configuration mixing consisting of energetically higher lying configurations .",
    "this qualitative picture for the positive parity levels has actually been observed in the shell model calculations by palacz _",
    "they showed that the positive - parity levels were highly configuration mixed .",
    "further , @xmath71 values of even cd - isotopes with @xmath72 are known to lie in the range 0.17 - 0.19 @xcite .",
    "thus , one might expect a small deformation in @xmath0cd and , consequently , the onset of mild collectivity .",
    "the regularity observed in the negative - parity band could not be reproduced in shell model calculations even with large valence basis space considered by palacz _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a mild deformation in @xmath0cd makes the core particle coupling model ( cpcm ) , proposed by muller and mosel @xcite , an ideal choice to interpret the observed excitation modes .",
    "the cpcm employed here has the added advantage that the experimental level energies of the core can be directly used as inputs .",
    "as the core simulation is not needed , the approach is especially suitable for very weakly deformed systems where variable moment of inertia ( vmi ) or constant moment of inertia ( cmi ) approaches within the standard particle rotor model fail due to the non - rotational nature of the core .",
    "the cpcm calculations were performed for the positive as well as negative - parity energy levels using both @xmath58cd and @xmath21cd cores .",
    "similar energy eigenvalues were obtained for most of the levels in @xmath0cd with both the cores .",
    "this was possible with a slight adjustment of the attenuation factor of the coriolis matrix element , keeping all other parameters the same .",
    "but the level energies as well as the transition probabilities of the higher - spin levels appear to be better reproduced with the @xmath58cd core and , hence , only the results of the calculations performed with the @xmath58cd core are being presented .",

    "the pairing gap parameter @xmath50 was estimated from the experimental odd - even mass difference and is similar to the value obtained from the expression @xmath50 = 12/a@xmath76 .",
    "it is generally observed that the use of @xmath50 value obtained from the experimental odd - even mass difference results in an overestimation of the coriolis interaction , requiring comparatively larger coriolis attenuation coefficients ( see table ii ) .",
    "the experimental core ( @xmath58cd ) energies from 0@xmath28 to 14@xmath28 states @xcite were supplied as inputs . since the experimental energies in @xmath58cd are available only up to @xmath32@xmath7714@xmath28 , the energies of the higher lying levels ( 16@xmath28 - 30@xmath28 ) of the core were obtained from a fit [ @xmath78 = a + b@xmath79 + c@xmath80 to the low - lying known levels and were also fed in as inputs ; here , @xmath79 denotes the spin of a particular level of the core and @xmath78 is the energy of the corresponding level .",
