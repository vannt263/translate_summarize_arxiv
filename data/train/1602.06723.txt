    "an _ epg representation _ @xmath3 of a graph @xmath4 , is a collection of paths @xmath5 of the two - dimensional grid @xmath6 , where the paths represent the vertices of @xmath4 in such a way that two vertices are adjacent in @xmath4 if and only if the corresponding paths share at least one edge of the grid .",
    "a graph which has an epg representation is called an _ epg graph _ ( epg stands for edge - intersection of paths on a grid ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the subclass @xmath1-epg . a",
    "_ b@xmath7-epg representation _ of @xmath4 is an epg representation in which each path in the representation has at most one _ bend _ ( turn on a grid point ) . recognizing @xmath1-epg graphs is an np - complete problem  @xcite .",
    "also , both the coloring and the maximum independent set problem are np - complete for @xmath1-epg graphs  @xcite .",
    "epg graphs have a practical use , for example , in the context of circuit layout setting , which may be modelled as paths ( wires ) on a grid . in the knock - knee layout model ,",
    "two wires may either cross or bend ( turn ) at a common point grid , but are not allowed to share a grid edge ; that is , overlap of wires is not allowed . in this context ,",
    "some of the classical optimization graph problems are relevant , for example , maximum independent set and coloring .",
    "more precisely , the layout of a circuit may have multiple layers , each of which contains no overlapping paths . referring to a corresponding epg graph ,",
    "then each layer is an independent set and a valid partitioning into layers corresponds to a proper coloring .    in this paper , we consider the problem of _ clique coloring _ , that is , coloring the vertices of a given graph such that no ( maximal ) clique of size at least two is monocolored .",
    "clique coloring can be seen also as coloring the clique hypergraph of a graph .",
    "the question of coloring clique hypergraphs was raised by duffus et al . in  @xcite .",
    "we prove that @xmath1-epg graphs are @xmath2-clique colorable .",
    "moreover , given a @xmath1-epg representation of a graph , we provide a linear time algorithm that constructs a @xmath2-clique coloring of it .",
    "all graphs considered here are connected , finite and simple , we follow the notation of  @xcite .",
    "the vertex set of a graph @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "complete graph _ is a graph that has all possible edges .",
    "a _ clique _ of a graph @xmath4 is a maximal complete subgraph of @xmath4 .",
    "a _ k - coloring _ of a graph @xmath4 is a function @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for adjacent vertices @xmath11 .",
    "the _ chromatic number _",
    "@xmath12 of a graph @xmath4 is the smallest positive integer @xmath13 such that @xmath4 has a @xmath13-coloring .",
    "a _ k - clique coloring _ of a graph @xmath4 is a function @xmath9 such that no clique of @xmath4 with size at least two is monocolored .",
    "a graph @xmath4 is _ k - clique colorable _ if @xmath4 has a @xmath13-clique coloring .",
    "the _ clique chromatic number _ of @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath14 , is the smallest @xmath13 such that @xmath4 has a @xmath13-clique coloring .",
    "clique coloring has some similarities with usual coloring .",
    "for example , every @xmath13-coloring is also a @xmath13-clique coloring , and @xmath12 and @xmath14 coincide if @xmath4 is triangle - free .",
    "but there are also essential differences , for example , a clique coloring of a graph need not be a clique coloring for its subgraphs . indeed , subgraphs may have a greater clique chromatic number than the original graph .",
    "another difference is that even a @xmath0-clique colorable graph can contain an arbitrarily large clique .",
    "it is known that the @xmath0-clique coloring problem is np - complete , even under different constraints @xcite .",
    "many families of graphs are @xmath15-clique colorable , for example , comparability graphs , co - comparability graphs , circular arc graphs and the @xmath13-powers of cycles @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "bacs et al .",
    "proved that almost all perfect graphs are @xmath15-clique colorable and conjectured that all perfect graphs are @xmath15-clique colorable .",
    "this conjecture was recently disproved by charbit et al .",
    "@xcite , who show that there exist perfect graphs with arbitrarily large clique chromatic number .",
    "previously known families of graphs having unbounded clique chromatic number are , for example , triangle - free graphs , ue graphs ( edge intersection graphs of paths in a tree ) , and line graphs @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that chordal graphs , and in particular interval graphs , are @xmath0-clique colorable  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the following result holds for strongly perfect graphs , a superclass of chordal graphs .",
    "[ l : chordal ] every strongly perfect graph admits a @xmath0-clique coloring in which one of the color classes is an independent set .    for chordal graphs , such a coloring can be easily obtained in linear time , by a slight modification of the @xmath0-clique coloring algorithm for chordal graphs proposed in  @xcite .",
    "namely , let @xmath16 be a perfect elimination ordering of the vertices of a chordal graph @xmath4 , i.e. , for each @xmath17 , @xmath18 $ ] is a clique of @xmath19 $ ] ; color the vertices from @xmath20 to @xmath21 with colors @xmath22 and @xmath23 in such a way that @xmath20 gets color @xmath22 and @xmath24 gets color @xmath23 if and only if all of its neighbors that are already colored got color @xmath22 .",
    "a perfect elimination ordering of the vertices of a chordal graph can be computed in linear time  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we prove that @xmath1-epg graphs are @xmath2-clique colorable .",
    "we need the following definitions and theorem .",
    "let @xmath25 be a @xmath1-epg representation of a graph @xmath4 .",
    "a clique @xmath26 of @xmath4 is an _ edge clique _ of @xmath25 if all the paths of @xmath5 that correspond to the vertices of @xmath26 share a common edge of the grid @xmath6 .",
    "a clique @xmath26 of @xmath4 is a _ claw clique _ of @xmath3 if there is a point @xmath27 of the grid and three edges of the grid sharing @xmath27 ( they may be shaped @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or @xmath31 ) , such that each path of @xmath5 that corresponds to a vertex of @xmath26 contains two of these three edges , and every pair of these three edges is contained in at least one path @xmath32 of @xmath5 ( so , it is not an edge clique ) .",
    "we say that the claw clique is _ centered at _",
    "@xmath27 , or that @xmath27 is the _ center _ of the claw clique .",
    "an example can be seen in figure  [ cliques ] .",
    "[ t:1 ] let @xmath25 be a @xmath1-epg representation of a graph @xmath4 .",
    "every clique in @xmath4 corresponds to either an edge clique or a claw clique in @xmath25 .",
    "now we can prove the main result of this paper .",
    "let @xmath4 be a @xmath1-epg graph .",
    "then , @xmath4 is 4-clique colorable .",
    "moreover , given a @xmath1-epg representation of @xmath4 , a 4-clique coloring of @xmath4 in which one of the color classes is an independent set can be obtained in linear time on the number of vertices and edges .",
    "let @xmath25 be a @xmath1-epg representation of the graph @xmath4 .",
    "each path of @xmath5 is composed of either a single segment , formed by one or more edges on the same row or column of the grid @xmath6 , or of two segments sharing a point of the grid , one horizontal ( i.e. , in a row ) and one vertical ( i.e. , in a column ) .",
    "we will first assign colors independently to the horizontal and vertical segments of each path , and then we will show how to combine those colors into a single color for each path , as required .    first , we use lemma  [ l : chordal ] to color the segments on each row and each column of @xmath6 as if they were vertices of an interval graph , with two colors @xmath22 and @xmath23 , such that the segments colored  @xmath23 form an independent set , i.e. , a pairwise non intersecting set , on each row ( respectively column ) .",
    "we thus obtain four types of paths according to the colors given to their corresponding segments : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where the first component corresponds to the horizontal segment of the path and the second component corresponds to the vertical segment of the path ; if one of these parts does not exist , we assign an @xmath22 to the missing component .",
    "observe that @xmath37    let us now investigate which cliques could be monocolored .",
    "edge cliques of @xmath25 are also cliques of the interval graph corresponding to the row of the grid , respectively column of the grid , to which the edge ( where all the paths of the clique intersect ) belongs .",
    "thus , the colors of the paths in such a clique have to be different in the horizontal component ( respectively in the vertical component ) , that is , the clique is not monocolored .",
    "let us now turn to the claw cliques .",
    "suppose that there is a claw clique which is monocolored .",
    "then this clique contains at least two paths whose horizontal segments overlap , and have the same color , and the same is true for vertical segments .",
    "since the horizontal segments colored @xmath23 form an independent set , and the same is true for the vertical segments , the only possible coloring of the paths in our monocolored claw clique is @xmath33 .",
    "now , for each point @xmath27 of the grid which is the center of one or more claw cliques monocolored @xmath33 , we will perform a recoloring of one or two paths having a bend at @xmath27 . in this way , each path will be recolored at most once , as it has at most one bend .",
    "paths without bends will not be recolored .",
    "the order in which we process the points @xmath27 of the grid does not matter : the recolorings are independent of recolorings at other grid points . in the recoloring we will assign color @xmath23 to some segments that were originally colored @xmath22 , obeying the following rules , for any fixed point @xmath27 of the grid :    a.   the recolored paths either get color @xmath34 or @xmath35,[i ] b.   every segment of a path with a bend at @xmath27 that is recolored @xmath23 is contained in a segment of a path with a bend at @xmath27 that is colored @xmath22 ; [ ix ] c.   if we recolor two paths with a bend at @xmath27 , they only share @xmath27 ( i.e. , they are shaped @xmath38 and @xmath39{6.6pt}{.4pt}\\rule{.4pt}{7pt}}$ ] or @xmath40{6.6pt}{.4pt}}$ ] and @xmath41 ) ; [ ii ] d.   [ iii ] after recoloring , there is no claw clique colored @xmath33 centered at @xmath27 .",
    "it will be explained below how to construct a recoloring obeying rules ( [ i ] )  ( [ iii ] ) .",
    "once such a recoloring is found , the segments colored @xmath23 may no longer be an independent set , but properties  ( [ i ] )  ( [ ii ] ) prevent us from creating new monocolored cliques .",
    "indeed , property  ( [ ix ] ) ensures that we create no monocolored edge clique .",
    "we claim that properties  ( [ i ] )   ( [ ii ] ) guarantee we have no new monocolored claw clique .",
    "assume instead that a claw clique centered at a grid point @xmath27 gets monocolored after the process , and by symmetry assume it is shaped @xmath28 . by ( [ i ] ) ,",
    "it is either monocolored @xmath34 or @xmath35 . in the first case ,",
    "the vertical segment of one of the paths having a bend at @xmath27 , let us say @xmath32 , has to be recolored , because the segments that were originally colored @xmath23 formed an independent set .",
    "property ( [ ix ] ) implies that there is a path @xmath42 having a bend at @xmath27 and whose vertical segment contains the vertical segment of @xmath32 and is colored @xmath22 ; this leads to a contradiction , because by maximality , @xmath42 belongs to the clique . in the second case ,",
    "since by ( [ ii ] ) at most one of the paths of the clique that have a bend at @xmath27 was recolored , and the segments that were originally colored @xmath23 formed an independent set , the horizontal segments of all the paths that belong to the clique and do not have a bend at @xmath27 were recolored @xmath23 .",
    "property ( [ ix ] ) implies that there is a path belonging to the clique whose horizontal segment is colored @xmath22 , a contradiction as well .",
    "these observations and property   ensure that after going through all grid points , we have found a @xmath2-clique coloring of @xmath4 . by and by property",
    ", the coloring has an independent color class .",
    "let us now explain how we find the recoloring with properties ( [ i ] ) , , ( [ ii ] ) and ( [ iii ] ) , for a fixed grid point @xmath27 .",
    "we distinguish three cases .",
    "let us say a shape is _ missing _ at @xmath27 if either there is no path of this shape with a bend at @xmath27 or there is at least one path of this shape with a bend at @xmath27 that is not colored @xmath33 .",

    "if there is no @xmath33-colored claw clique centered at @xmath27 , we do not recolor anything . clearly ,   ",
    "otherwise , there is a unique @xmath33-colored claw clique at @xmath27 , and symmetry allows us to assume this clique is shaped @xmath28 .",
