    "low energy phenomena in strong interactions are described by effective field theories which contain appropriate degrees of freedom to describe physical phenomena occurring at the nucleon - meson scale .",
    "chiral perturbation theory was extremely successful in describing systems like pionic atoms , however it is not directly applicable for the kaonic systems .",
    "this is due to the presence of resonances like the @xmath6(1405 ) , only slightly below the @xmath7 reaction threshold of 1432 mev . instead ,",
    "non - perturbative coupled - channel techniques are used .",
    "these calculations generate the @xmath6(1405 ) dynamically as a @xmath0 quasibound state and as a resonance in the @xmath8@xmath9 channel .",
    "a general feature of the theory in this field is that it relies heavily on input from experimental data .",
    "the measurement of the strong - interaction induced energy - level shift and width of the kaonic - hydrogen @xmath3 atomic state provides direct information on the @xmath0 @xmath10-wave interaction at @xmath7 threshold .",
    "kaonic - hydrogen x - ray data are therefore important for theories of the @xmath0 system , together with the experimental data of low - energy @xmath7 scattering , @xmath11 mass spectra , and @xmath7 threshold decay ratios .",
    "these studies allow the investigation of chiral su(3 ) dynamics in low - energy qcd and the role of explicit chiral symmetry - breaking due to the relatively large strange quark mass .",
    "these data are also strongly related to recent hot topics  the structure of the @xmath12 resonance ( @xmath13 @xcite ) and the deeply bound kaonic systems ( @xmath13 @xcite ) .",
    "recent progress in this field is summarized in @xcite .",
    "the shift and width are deduced from the spectroscopy of the @xmath1-series kaonic - hydrogen x rays .",
    "the first distinct peaks of the kaonic - hydrogen x rays were observed by the kek - ps e228 group @xcite following the absorption of a stopped @xmath14 within a gaseous hydrogen target using si(li ) detectors .",
    "the observed repulsive shift was consistent with the analysis of the low energy @xmath0 scattering data , resolving the long - standing sign discrepancy generated by old experiments @xcite .",
    "the most recent values were reported by the dear experiment @xcite , in which the errors were reduced by a factor of 2 when compared with those of e228 @xcite .    using the results obtained by dear ,",
    "theoretical studies have been performed with possible higher order contributions using several models @xcite .",
    "however , the question still remains that most of them had difficulties in explaining all the experimental results in a consistent way .",
    "see also @xcite .    here",
    "we report on results based on the x - ray detection technique recently developed by the siddharta ( silicon drift detector for hadronic atom research by timing application ) collaboration , using the microsecond timing and excellent energy resolution of large area silicon drift detectors ( sdds ) @xcite .",
    "this technique reduced the large x - ray background coming from beam losses and improved the signal - to - background ratio by more than a factor of 10 with respect to the corresponding dear ratio of about 1/100 .",
    "the siddharta experiment was performed at the da@xmath15ne electron - positron collider at the laboratori nazionali di frascati of infn .",
    "the @xmath16-resonances produced decay into back - to - back @xmath17 pairs emitted with a branching ratio of about 49 % .",
    "the monochromatic low - energy kaons ( @xmath18 16 mev of kinetic energy ) are stopped efficiently in a gaseous target to produce kaonic hydrogen atoms .",
    "it is essential to use a gaseous target for the measurements since the x - ray yields quickly decrease towards higher density due to the stark mixing effect .",
    "therefore , a cryogenic gaseous hydrogen target was used at typical values of a pressure 0.1 mpa and a temperature 23 k , resulting in a density of @xmath19 g/@xmath20 of the isotopically pure hydrogen .",

    "two plastic scintillation counters ( 1.5 mm thick ) , called the kaon detector , were mounted above and below the @xmath22 interaction point where the @xmath16 resonance is produced .",
    "a kaon trigger was defined by the coincidence of the two scintillators .",
    "minimum ionizing particles ( mips ) coming from beam losses were highly suppressed by setting a high pulse - height threshold in the kaon detector  the slow kaons deposit much more energy in the scintillators than the faster mips .    to obtain a uniform distribution of @xmath14 momenta entering the gaseous target , a shaped degrader made of mylar foils with a thickness ranging from 100 to 800 @xmath23 m was placed as shown in fig .",

    "the lateral wall and the bottom window were made of kapton polyimide film of 75 @xmath23 m and 50 @xmath23 m thickness .",

    "the response function of the sdd detectors was found to contain a slight deviation from a pure gaussian shape , which could influence the determination of the strong - interaction width of the kaonic - hydrogen x - ray lines .",

    "the right flank could be interpreted as an effect of pile - up events and was defined as a gaussian @xcite .    in the second analysis ,",
    "the correction of the `` ideal '' response was done by convoluting the gauss function with a lorentzian ( producing symmetric tails ) and additionally with an exponential low energy tail .    in both analyses ,",

    "the higher transitions to the @xmath3 level , @xmath44 and above , produce an important contribution to the total intensity .",
    "the relative intensities of these lines , however , are only poorly known from cascade calculations and the free fit can not accurately distinguish between them , since their relative energy differences are smaller than their width , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : specfit ] . as a result ,",
    "fitting all the transitions at once , leads to large errors on the shift and width of the @xmath3 level . to minimize the influence of the higher transitions , we adopted the following iterative fitting procedure . in a first step",
    ", we performed a free fit of all the transitions , with the energy differences between the kaonic - hydrogen lines fixed by their em differences , since the shifts and the widths of the levels higher than @xmath3 are negligible . in a second step ,",
    "we fixed the energies and widths of the higher transitions to the values found in the first step , and fitted leaving free all intensities and the common shift and width for @xmath32 and @xmath31 , which are well resolved transitions . with the new values for shift and width we repeated the described procedure until the values for the shift and width converged , meaning that all @xmath1-lines had the same values for their shift and width , as it should be .",
    "we performed two independent analyses , where the event selection , the calibration method , the fit range and the detector - response function ( as described above ) were chosen differently .",
    "the comparison of the shift and width values gives a direct measurement of the systematic error from the use of differing procedures .",
    "the resulting shift values were consistent with each other within 1 ev , however the width differed by @xmath18 40 ev which comes mainly from the use of different detector - response functions . for shift and width",
    "we quote here the mean value of the two analyses and take into account the difference as one of the sources of the systematic error .    as a result ,",
    "the @xmath3-level shift @xmath35 and width @xmath45 of kaonic hydrogen were determined to be @xmath46 respectively , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "the quoted systematic error is a quadratic summation of the contributions from the ambiguities due to the sdd gain shift , the sdd response function , the adc linearity , the low - energy tail of the kaonic - hydrogen higher transitions , the energy resolution , and the procedural dependence shown by independent analysis .",
    "if we could fix the intensity pattern of all transitions , which would be possible if more accurate cascade calculations existed , the statistical error would be better than @xmath47 25 ev for shift and @xmath47 55 ev for width .",
