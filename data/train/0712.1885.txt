    "sum rules on the conductivity have played an important role in the analysis of optical conductivity data , which give information on electron dynamics . in its simplest form , for an infinite free electron band",
    ", the sum rule gives the plasma frequency which is independent of temperature , interactions and impurity scattering.@xcite in tight - binding models it is related to the second derivative with respect to the momentum @xmath1 of the band dispersion @xmath2 , times the probability of occupation of the state @xmath3.@xcite in the special case where only nearest - neighbor hopping is present on a square lattice , the sum - rule integral reduces to minus one half the kinetic energy in appropriate units . as a consequence , in general it is affected by the interactions present in the system , and",
    "these determine both its absolute value and its variations with temperature .",
    "this fact has been investigated recently both experimentally and theoretically in the context of high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors ( see ref.for a review ) .",
    "it follows from the sommerfeld expansion that the relative temperature variation of the sum - rule integral in non - interacting tight - binding models is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the nearest - neighbor hopping . in the experiments done in the normal state of cuprates , the temperature variations of the the sum rule are much larger than this estimate , and in some cases",
    "deviate from a simple @xmath7 law .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to correlation effects .",
    "for example , in the studies of the hubbard or @xmath8 model @xcite , a new energy scale emerges associated with the reduced width of the renormalized band .",
    "this parameter replaces the hopping parameter @xmath6 in the @xmath5 dependence leading to its enhancement .",
    "it is shown in other theoretical approaches that the sum rule integral measures instead a specific average of the quasiparticle lifetime@xcite normalized to the fermi energy @xmath9 , and hence such optical experiments ultimately probe correlation effects through lifetime broadening .",
    "these examples illustrate that optical data can provide important insight into correlation effects .",
    "graphene , which is a single layer of graphite , has recently been isolated and its properties investigated ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "bilayer graphene@xcite and thicker graphite films are also now widely produced .",
    "since graphene possesses truly remarkable properties both from the technological and theoretical points of view , there has already been considerable work done on monolayer and bilayer graphene and also on related materials . in particular , recent data are available on the ac conductivity in the infrared region of graphite@xcite , several layer epitaxial graphite@xcite , and on monolayer@xcite and bilayer@xcite graphene .",
    "there has also been much theoretical work on the microwave and infrared conductivity of graphene@xcite ( see ref .   for a review ) and on a bilayer@xcite and multilayer.@xcite thus , it is of interest to anticipate some general results on the optical - conductivity sum rule behavior of these systems , which are likely to be tested experimentally in the near future . the optical sum rules for the ( in - plane ) longitudinal and hall conductivities were studied for monolayer graphene in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the unusual dependences of the sum rules on temperature and chemical potential were revealed . for example , at the neutral dirac point the linear dispersion law of quasiparticles leads to a @xmath10 dependence of the sum - rule , instead of the @xmath7 law found in tight - binding bands@xcite .",
    "a specific and very useful feature of graphene , not available in ordinary metals , is that it is possible to change the chemical potential @xmath11 and thus the number of carriers by tuning the gate voltage @xmath12 ( @xmath13 for monolayer graphene ) in a field - effect device .",
    "it was shown@xcite that in the limit @xmath14 the concentration - dependent part of the sum rule goes like @xmath15 .",
    "for a finite temperature @xmath16 , there is a temperature dependent correction to the sum of order @xmath17 which is very much as in the more ordinary @xmath7-law case discussed above .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the previous work to the case of bilayer graphene . in the case",
    "considered most often , a bilayer graphene consists of two coupled hexagonal lattices .",
    "the inequivalent sites @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 on the bottom and top graphene sheets are arranged according to bernal ( @xmath22 ) stacking : every @xmath19 site in the bottom layer lies directly below an @xmath20 site in the upper layer .",
    "the strongest inter - layer coupling between pairs of @xmath22 orbitals , @xmath23 , changes the electron dispersion from a linear to a quadratic form @xcite .",
    "in addition to this effect , bilayer graphene is the only known material in which the electronic band structure can be changed significantly simply by applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers.@xcite indeed , while the unbiased bilayer system is a semi - metal , with parabolic valence and conduction band touching each other at the neutrality point , the system becomes a semiconductor when the two layers are electrostatically inequivalent .",
    "the corresponding semiconducting gap @xmath24 between valence and conduction bands is tunable continuously from zero to @xmath25.@xcite as shown experimentally , the asymmetry gap @xmath26 and the carrier concentration can be controlled independently through an applied gate voltage and chemical deposition of potassium or other atoms on the vacuum side of the structure.@xcite recently , similar results have also been obtained in a double - gated structure made of bilayer graphene sandwiched in between two gate electrodes @xcite .",
    "this effect has been understood by means of both tight - binding calculations@xcite and ab initio calculations @xcite .    beyond the clear potential impact that this effect has on device applications ,",
    "it is extremely interesting from the theoretical point of view to understand how this field - induced band transition will affect the conduction properties of the system . in light of the previous discussion concerning the physics of cuprates",
    ", one could ask if the opening of the gap due to the metal - insulator transition in hubbard - like models , or across the metal - superconductor transition in superconducting models , share commonality with the physics of bilayer graphene .",
    "as we shall demonstrate below , these phenomena are drastically different .",
    "indeed , we show that the sum rule is essentially protected against the opening of the semiconductor gap in this bilayer system . despite the fact that @xmath24 can be as big as a significant fraction of the fermi energy , the relative sum - rule changes from the unbiased to the biased system are of order of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , even though a general redistribution of spectral weight is expected due to the opening of the gap , the total sum rule is practically constant .",
    "one would have expected the large band structure changes involved to lead to corresponding significant changes in the optical sum . here",
    ", however , we show that this is not the case . the relative changes in optical spectral weight induced by the opening of the gap",
    "must largely compensate each other , leaving the total weight almost unchanged .",
    "for a generic electronic model described by the hamiltonian @xmath28 the optical - conductivity sum rule is given by:@xcite w(t)=_-^ _ xx ( ) d = _ xx , where @xmath29 is the unit - cell volume and @xmath30 is the so - called mass tensor , which appears in the second - order expansion of @xmath28 evaluated at finite vector potential @xmath31 : h()h(0 ) - _ , = x , y , and @xmath32 is the current density in the @xmath33 direction . the vector potential @xmath34 is introduced in the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) written below by means of the peierls substitution , @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the fermi operators of electrons on @xmath20 , @xmath21 sublattices of the second layer .",

    "accordingly , the general tight - binding hamiltonian for a bilayer reads [ hamilton - lattice ] h&=&-t_,(a^+_1+b_1+h.c . )",

    "when @xmath41 this hamiltonian is equivalent to the slonzewski - weiss - mcclure ( swm ) model@xcite for the bulk graphite , provided that one retains only in - plane and @xmath23 out - of - plane hopping , and assumes no dispersion along the @xmath42 axis ( perpendicular to the planes)@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the connected sites @xmath20 and @xmath19 lie directly below and above each other , so that the magnetic field perpendicular to the bilayer does not affect this coupling .",
    "this is not the case for the weaker @xmath43 coupling @xmath44 included in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) for completeness . in what follows ,",
    "however , we will neglect this term , whose role is negligible as far as the longitudinal optical sum rule is concerned .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath26 represents the asymmetry of the on - site energies on the two layers , and it is induced by the electric field applied perpendicular to the graphene bilayer . as we shall see below , it is responsible of the splitting of the valence and conduction bands .",
    "the hamiltonian describes four bands@xcite @xmath45 , @xmath46 with _ ^()()&= & , + & = & , where the function @xmath47 . by expanding @xmath48 around the two inequivalent @xmath49 points in the brillouin zone one",

    ", one can easily see from eq .   that at large momenta the four bands reproduce the two dirac cones @xmath55 of each uncoupled layer .",
    "the low - energy band dispersion is , however , drastically affected by the interplane hopping @xmath56 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath24 .",

    "although the linear approximation for @xmath48 is sufficient for the analysis of the low - energy band structure and for the numerical study of the mass tensor below , the derivation of this tensor must be done using an unexpanded expression for @xmath48.@xcite it follows from the definition that ( the factor @xmath69 accounts for the spin ) _ xx= _ , where we kept the full momentum dependence of @xmath48 ( @xmath70 is the number of unit cells ) .",

    "nonetheless , as we shall see these two quantities show approximately the same doping dependence , satisfying again the general relation between sum rule and kinetic energy , despite the complicated band evolution with doping of the bilayer system .",
    "as we already mentioned , it was shown experimentally@xcite that one can tune independently the asymmetry gap @xmath24 between the two layers and the total carrier density ( the value of @xmath11 ) .",

    "we use @xmath103  , and show results for @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "this choice is suggested by the fact that in the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite the gap closes at @xmath94 given approximately by @xmath106 @xmath105 ( notice that @xmath97 expressed in units of @xmath107 @xmath105 corresponds to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the number of electrons per unit cell @xmath109 ) .",
    "the doping dependence of the @xmath110 at @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . as one can see , even though the charging gap @xmath24 changes consistently with doping ( see inset of fig .  [ sumt0 ] ) , due to the screening effects of the bilayer device , nonetheless the sum rule attains overall variations of @xmath111 , which are undetectable from an experimental point of view . in other words , despite the large optical - conductivity spectral - weight redistribution associated with the opening of the gap through the semimetal - semiconductor transition induced by doping , the sum rule is not affected .",
    "it follows the same behavior that one would obtain in ( electrostatically ) uncoupled layers where @xmath57 at all doping ( see the dashed - dotted line in fig .  [ sumt0 ] ) . in the regime where the gap is relatively small ( for example at negative doping for the @xmath112@xmath105 curve in fig .  [ sumt0 ] )",
    "the sum rule follows approximately the same doping dependence found in the single - layer case , i.e. @xmath113/{\\cal v}\\simeq -2a^2|\\mu|^3/(9\\pi \\hbar^2v_f^2)$ ] .",
    "since @xmath114 , and @xmath115 has an overall variation of at most @xmath116 in the considered doping range , one can easily get the small sum - rule variation with doping . at larger gap values , @xmath117 is slightly larger than expected in the single - layer case , but is still too small to be detected experimentally .",
    "as far as the temperature dependence is concerned we always found a @xmath5 variation , as expected due to the parabolic structure of the low - energy bands . including other hoppings such as @xmath44 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton - lattice ] )",
    "can change the dispersion curve as discussed in@xcite ( see also ref .  ) for energies less than @xmath118 .",
    "while this can slightly affect the overall value of the optical integral and of the self - consistent @xmath26 , it does not change the main conclusion of our calculation , which focus on the relative doping changes of the sum rule when a large semiconducting gap @xmath26 of order of a few hundred mev is opened .",
    "having established that the relatively large band - structure changes caused by the opening of the gap @xmath26 lead to a negligible changes in the optical sum , we expect that the above mentioned hopping terms introduce negligible corrections as well .",
    "analogously , the kinetic energy , shown in fig .  [ kinetic ] , is not much affected by the opening of the gap , and it attains a value which is approximately 6 times the sum rule , @xmath119 .",
    "there are however two differences in the doping dependence of the sum rule with respect to the kinetic energy .",
    "first , we notice that the very small changes in the sum rule and kinetic energy have the opposite trend : indeed , they both decrease when the gap opens , in contrast to what is found for example at the transition between a normal metal and a superconductor , where a kinetic - energy increase corresponds to a sum - rule decrease and vice - versa .",
    "this effect disappears when we set @xmath84 in our numerical work : indeed , in this case @xmath30 reproduces exactly twice the single - layer value computed in ref . , and the sum rule and the kinetic energy track each other exactly as the doping is varied .",
    "second , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ kinetic ] that the chemical - potential jump at the neutrality point in the biased case ( see inset ( b ) of fig.[kinetic ] ) is much more effective on the kinetic - energy doping dependence .",
    "the two curves for @xmath120 at @xmath121@xmath105 in fig .  [ kinetic ] show a kink at @xmath122 which is clearly due to the @xmath100 discontinuity at the neutrality point . indeed , in the case where no gap is present in the system @xmath100 goes smoothly across @xmath122 , as does the kinetic energy . instead , the sum - rule curves in fig .",
    "[ sumt0 ] are not much affected by the @xmath11 discontinuity at @xmath122 .",
    "in summary we investigated the behavior of the optical sum in bilayer graphene as a function of charge imbalance carrier density @xmath97 and temperature . while a small temperature variation could be expected because of the relatively small effect of temperature on the electronic excitations , the negligible dependence of the sum rule on the carrier density was not a priori expected . indeed , despite the profound band - structure changes induced by the change of doping , no significant signature appears on the overall spectral weight .",
    "this implies that the spectral weight lost in the gap must appear above it , and the two must largely compensate for each other .",
    "observe that in order to be able to test experimentally such a prediction one would need to define an `` experimental '' cut - off . indeed , even though the relation is theoretically established by integrating the optical conductivity to all frequencies , in practice an intrinsic cut - off is provided by the frequency @xmath123 above which transitions to other electronic bands not considered in the present study would develop.@xcite according to optical studies on graphite@xcite , the optical sum rule saturates to the value corresponding to one electron per atom ( as due to the @xmath124 band considered here ) around 8 ev , while optical transitions coming from the @xmath125 bands appear around @xmath126 .",
    "however , in the present case a much smaller cut - off could be used , if one wants just to compare the spectral - weight variations induced by the opening of the gap .",
    "indeed , the spectral - weight redistribution is expected to fall in a range of frequencies of order @xmath127 , as confirmed recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , an upper cut - off of order of @xmath128 ev should be enough to account for the gap - opening effects , and to test experimentally the predicted robustness of the optical sum rule .",
    "it is worth noting that in our calculation only the electrostatic interaction between layers was included , since this is believed to be the most important effect in the system .",
    "however , as in the case of cuprates superconductors other mechanisms ( electron repulsion or electron - phonon interactions ) could be at play and modify the sum rule .",
    "thus , the experimental verification of our prediction would help understanding if other interactions need or need not be taken into account in dealing with these systems .",
