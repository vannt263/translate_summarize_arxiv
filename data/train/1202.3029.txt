    "in this paper we consider two - dimensional internal periodic waves traveling at the interface between two layers of immiscible fluids with different densities , under the rigid lid assumption . in our context , the fluids have constant vorticity and we construct internal traveling waves with a critical layer and stagnation points in both gravity and capillary - gravity regimes .",
    "a critical layer is a region of fluid consisting entirely of closed streamlines , and stagnation points are fluid particles traveling horizontally with the same speed as the wave",
    ". flows with stagnation points are known @xcite to be relevant for the description of background states for tsunamis . concerning waves traveling over a homogeneous fluid",
    ", it was observed in @xcite that the strong elliptic maximum principle rules out the existence of smooth irrotational waves with stagnation points or critical layers . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there exist extreme stokes waves which are lipschitz continuous and have stagnation points and a sharp corner at the crest . for the rotational case",
    "the picture is different .",
    "existence of exact periodic traveling gravity waves with general vorticity has been established first in @xcite by means of bifurcation and degree theory , and in @xcite in the case of waves with bounded and discontinuous vorticity . by construction",
    ", the waves in @xcite do not possess stagnation points and critical layers .",
    "linear gravity water waves with stagnation points which travel on currents with constant vorticity were studied in @xcite , and the exact picture of the waves has been obtained first in @xcite , and later on in @xcite by employing complex methods .",
    "these waves possess at most a critical layer which is located within the fluid body .",
    "one of the factors which can determine the presence of critical layers is the vertical stratification of the fluid .",
    "it was recently shown in @xcite that continuously stratified gravity waves with constant vorticity may possess two critical layers and the qualitative picture of the streamlines may be different than that for homogeneous flows @xcite .",
    "another factor is the presence of an affine vorticity distribution , situation analysed in @xcite , when the waves may possess arbitrarily many critical layers . for a survey on traveling waves with critical layers we refer to the article @xcite .",
    "internal waves are usually created by the presence of two different layers of water combined with a certain configuration of relief and current .",
    "they form where the water above and below the interface is either moving in opposite directions or in the same direction at different speeds .",
    "a well - known example are the internal waves which move from the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea , at the east of the strait of gibraltar . in this case",
    "the two layers correspond to different salinities , whereas the current is caused by the tide passing through the strait .",
    "the mathematical theory of waves at the interface between two layers of immiscible fluid of different densities has attracted a lot of interest and we refer to the survey article of helfrich and melville @xcite which provides a good overview on steady internal solitary waves in such systems .    in this paper",
    "we construct periodic steady internal waves between two layers of homogeneous fluids with different densities in the gravity and capillary - gravity regimes . particularly , we find solutions which possess exactly one critical layer which is bounded from above by the wave profile . moreover ,",
    "the gradient of the stream function associated to the fluid beneath the interface vanishes at exactly two points on the interface , meaning that , close to these points , fluid particles located below the interface move almost horizontally with velocity approaching the wave speed .",
    "the fluid above the interface does not sense the presence of these stagnation points .",
    "in contrast to the situation in @xcite , where waves with critical layers were constructed in an unstable regime , the solutions we find are stably stratified . while in @xcite",
    "the wave surface is only lipschitz continuous in a neighbourhood of the stagnation point , our solutions are real - analytic . in the pure gravity case",
    "this follows by using a regularity result for free boundary value problems , cf .",
    "@xcite , whereas when capillary plays a role we provide a new idea based on parabolic theory .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that our method may be applied to prove the a priori analyticity of water waves traveling over an homogeneous fluid , when capillary effects are incorporated , provided the vorticity function is bounded , analytic , and non - increasing even if stagnation points exist ( situation complementary to that analysed in @xcite ) .",
    "we determine , by using higher order expansions and elliptic maximum principles , a precise picture of the streamlines in the fluids which could be used to describe the particle trajectories . due to the analyticity of the interface , one could choose also linear theory , similarly as in @xcite , to obtain an approximative picture of the exact particle paths .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ s:1 ] we present the mathematical model , re - express the problem in terms of the stream functions and provide the main regularity result theorem [ mt:0 ] . in section [ s:2 ]",
    "we write the problem as a nonlocal equation for the wave profile , and use bifurcation theory to prove the existence statement theorem [ mt:1 ] as well as higher order expansion for the bifurcation curves . in the last section , based on theorem [ mt:0 ] , we illustrate the precise picture of the streamlines for some of the waves obtained in theorem [ mt:0 ] .",
    "in this section we present the governing equations for two - dimensional internal water waves travelling at the boundary region between two rotational fluids with different densities under the rigid lid condition at the top . the bottom of the ocean is assumed to be flat and we denote with @xmath0 the unit circle , i.e. @xmath0 stands for @xmath1 .",
    "the fluid domain @xmath2 contains two fluids layers separated by a sharp interface @xmath3 , the wave profile , which defines the two subsets @xmath4 the domain @xmath5 contains a newtonian fluid with constant density @xmath6 velocity field @xmath7 , and pressure @xmath8 , and we denote by @xmath9 @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the density , velocity , and pressure of the fluid located at the top .",
    "the line @xmath12 is the impermeable bottom of the ocean and @xmath13 is the rigid top of the two - fluid system . assuming that both fluids are inviscid , the dynamics can be described by euler s equations ( see @xcite for a justification of the inviscid flow ) .",
    "being interested in traveling internal waves , we presuppose that there exists a positive constant @xmath14 , the wave speed , such that @xmath15 , @xmath16 and formulate the problem in a frame moving with the wave .",
    "the equations of motion are the steady state two - dimensional euler equations    [ eq:2 ] @xmath17 subjected to the boundary conditions , see e.g. @xcite , @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the surface tension coefficient and @xmath20 the constant of gravity . to be more precise , we are interested in finding solutions of problem within the class @xmath21 for some @xmath22 similarly as in @xcite , we reformulate the problem by introducing the stream functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 defined by the relations @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a positive constant fixed such that @xmath27 on @xmath28 indeed , taking into account that @xmath29 and @xmath30 it follows , by using the chain rule and , that @xmath31 is constant on @xmath32 and we can make this choice .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 is constant on the rigid lid @xmath34 and we let @xmath35 be this constant .",
    "the above properties show that the streamlines coincide with the level curves of the stream functions .",
    "both fluids being rotational , we introduce their vorticity by @xmath36 next , we assume that @xmath37 and exclude so the presence of stagnation points in the fluids .",
    "however , this assumption will be dropped later on , after expressing the problem in terms of the stream functions .",
    "this will allow us to find solutions of system which do possess stagnation points .",
    "condition guarantees @xcite that the vorticity is a single - valued function of the stream function , that is , there exist @xmath38)$ ] and @xmath39)$ ] , the vorticity functions , with @xmath40 since , by bernoulli s principle , the quantities @xmath41 are constant in @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , we find , by restricting to @xmath44 that @xmath45    to conclude , we observe that @xmath31 and @xmath33 are solutions of the semilinear dirichlet problems    [ eq : pp ] @xmath46 respectively , and they are coupled by the following equation @xmath47 for some constant @xmath48 if we integrate this last equation over the unit circle , we obtain , by taking into account that @xmath49 , that @xmath50    the integral over @xmath0 is normalised such that @xmath51 it is not difficult to check that given two vorticity functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 and a classical solution @xmath54 of , then we can associate to this solution a unique solution of problem , even if the condition is not satisfied .",
    "this formulation of problem is much more convenient because we deal with two coupled semilinear elliptic problems.if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are such that we may solve for given @xmath55 , which is definitely the case when the fluids have constant vorticity , then reduces to the problem of determining @xmath56 as in @xcite , we remark that the solutions of are solutions of for any value @xmath57 of the wave speed .    as a first result",
    ", we use in the pure gravity case @xmath58 a theorem on the regularity of free interfaces from @xcite , which was employed in @xcite to establish analyticity of traveling water waves without stagnation points on the profile in different wave regimes , to prove that internal traveling waves with real - analytic vorticity functions are a priori real - analytic .",
    "when we incorporate surface tension effects , we provide a new idea , which is based on parabolic theory , and show the real - analyticity without excluding the existence of stagnation points .",
    "[ mt:0 ] let @xmath59 and assume that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constant functions .",
    "given a solution @xmath54 of within the class , we assume , when @xmath58 , that @xmath60 then , the wave profile @xmath55 is real - analytic @xmath61    it is clear from the proof of theorem [ mt:0 ] that its assertion is true in the case @xmath58 for arbitrary analytic vorticity functions @xmath62 provided is fulfilled .",
    "when @xmath63 and @xmath64 are bounded and satisfy additionally @xmath65 then the claim of theorem [ mt:0 ] is still true .",
    "relation ensures the unique solvability of the dirichlet problems , see theorem 3.3 in @xcite , which permits us to express the problem by the equation .",
    "our method may be used to prove analyticity of the profile for traveling water waves with stagnation points in the capillary and capillary - gravity regime , provided the vorticity function is non - increasing , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath58 first , we re - write the coupling equation in a different way . since the boundary conditions on @xmath44 of both problems imply that the tangential component of @xmath66 and @xmath67 vanish at the wave profile , this implies @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is the unit normal at @xmath28 with this notation , equation is equivalent to the following relation @xmath70 clearly , @xmath71 is real - analytic in all its arguments .",
    "furthermore , our assumption implies that @xmath72 on @xmath73 which shows that the assumptions of theorem 3.2 in @xcite ( see also the remark following it ) are all satisfied and the claim follows at once .    the proof in the case when @xmath74 is different .",
    "indeed , we can reduce the problem ( see e.g. section [ s:2 ] ) to an operator equation @xmath75 where setting @xmath76 we have that @xmath77 is a real - analytic operator with @xmath78 because we use parabolic theory later on in the proof , we introduce the small hlder spaces @xmath79 @xmath80",
