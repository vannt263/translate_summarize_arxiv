    "[ stress167](b ) .",
    "initially , most of the strain is connected to the deformation of the mo - s - mo bond angles across the bridging plane like in an accordion while the mo - s distances and the structure of the mo octahedra remain almost constant , ( see fig .",

    "very soon the value of the critical stress , @xmath44 gpa is reached , ( see fig .  [ stress167](a ) ) , when it becomes energetically more favourable for the mo - s - mo bonds to jump into their stretched configurations .",
    "however , the potential barrier between the two configurations prevents such transitions , the system remains in a metastable state ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ stress167 ] ) until the unstable region is reached when all the mo - s - mo bonds suddenly jump at constant stress to the stretched state .",
    "on contraction , upon reducing the stress , the mo - s - mo bonds remain in the stretched state down into the metastable region until they eventually jump into the slightly compressed state in the unstretched state .",
    "the @xmath45 nanowires thus show a hysteresis in the stress - strain graph , caused by the potential barrier between the two energy minima which originate in the nature of the mo - s - mo bonds across the bridging planes .",
    "of course , the mo - s - mo angles can not open beyond @xmath46 , and this is the reason for an increase in @xmath47 at large strains and for a higher elastic constant , @xmath48 gpa , than in the first energy minimum .",
    "the non - linear regime at higher @xmath49 is the consequence of anharmonic forces and is not related to plastic deformation which is absent in our dft calculations .",
    "of course , the chains eventually break at the maximal stress .",
    "this defines the ideal tensile strength , @xmath50 gpa .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ stretch167 ] tells us that the weakest links , where the chains break , are  surprisingly  the mo octahedra and not the mo - s - mo bridges .",
    "this is also the reason why all mosi@xmath13 nanowires have similar tensile strengths .    in the experiments the wires were subject to an initial stress which most probably brings all the mo - s - mo bridges into their stretched configurations . only after this initial treatment",
    "the elastic constants were measured .",
    "therefore one must compare the experimental elastic constant with that of stretched mo - s - mo bridge configurations .",
    "however , it remains a mystery , why the experimental longitudinal young moduli exceed the elastic constants @xmath25 reported in this paper by a factor of 4 or more.@xcite the above values of @xmath25 were calcualted on a hexagonal array of molecular chanin with all chains carrying equal load . for comparison ,",
    "the young modulus of a hexagonal array of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnt ) with the lattice spacing 1.7 nm is @xmath51 gpa which is about 6 times the calculated value of @xmath25.@xcite    the accordion effect is present also in other _",
    "one - dimensional _ carbon chains like polyethylene or polyacetylene .",
    "what is unique to @xmath52 is the double energy minimum .",
    "an additional sulfur in the centre of the bridging planes in @xmath52 significantly increases the elastic constant ( @xmath53 gpa ) , because it hinders the accordion effect  of the mo - s - mo bonds . in case of @xmath52",
    "there is also no sign of a second energy minimum in strained nanowires .",
    "finally we notice that the calculated elastic constant @xmath25 of @xmath3 is more than 3 times smaller than @xmath25 of @xmath54 or @xmath55 where the flexible mo - s - mo bridges are absent.@xcite          the electron bandstructure of the conduction or valence band , fig .",
