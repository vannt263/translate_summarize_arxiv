    "it is known that the top quark is substantially more massive than the rest of the observed quarks .",
    "it is therefore worth to search for the physical mechanism that introduces the mass difference and at the same time use the top as a probe into new physics , which often couples to mass . in the presence of new physics",
    "it is expected that the coupling of the top would deviate from the standard model predictions .",
    "in particular one can construct a cp conserving effective lagrangian of the wtb vertex and parametrise the anomalous couplings with form factors .",
    "it is then possible to identify a set of physical observables @xcite .",
    "this analysis focuses specifically on the forward backward asymmetry of the b quarks from all hadronic @xmath0 decays . to calculate the asymmetry one needs first to identify the b quark jets , discriminate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks and identify @xmath0 events",
    "after the event reconstruction and the jet finding algorithms , in which all events are artificially forced into a six jet configuration , have been performed the analysis aims to identify all the jets that originated from b quarks .    for this task",
    "the lcfivertex flavour tagging package has been used@xcite .",
    "the procedure uses the zvtop - zvres  @xcite vertex finder followed by a series of algorithms calculating flavour discriminating variables and a neural network , which uses these discriminating variables to determine the flavour of the jet .",
    "the results produced from this algorithm in the benchmarking di - jet sample can be seen in figure  [ fig : btag2 ] .",
    "the results for the @xmath0 events can be seen in figure  [ fig : btag6 ] .",
    "sample.,width=264,height=181 ]     sample.,width=264,height=181 ]",
    "it is then possible to discriminate between @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks . in order to do this",
    "two algorithms are employed : the momentum weighted jet charge and the momentum weighted vertex charge .",
    "the algorithms are conceptually the same but they differ in the track selection . in the vertex charge algorithm",
    "all the tracks present in all the reconstructed secondary vertices are selected ; differently in the jet charge all the tracks present in the jet are considered . after the track selection",
    "is completed we weight the tracks with respect to their momentum since the most energetic tracks carry are more likely to more information about the charge of the @xmath1 quark .",
    "the vertex charge method is particularly good at discriminating @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons ( and hence the constituent quarks ) when at least one secondary vertex is reconstructed ( see figure  [ fig : bplus ] ) .",
    "this is by far the cleanest of the possibilities .",
    "the jet charge is instead useful in the more difficult and more frequent occurrences when either the hadron is a @xmath5 or @xmath6 or when a secondary vertex has not been reconstructed .",
    "after both the jet charge and the vertex charge are calculated it is possible to recombine them into a single discriminating value by using the probability distribution function derived at monte carlo level @xcite ( figure  [ fig : bbar ] ) .",
    "it is at this point essential to look at a method to identify well reconstructed hadronically decayed @xmath0 .",
    "this is meant to discriminate both the standard model background , at present not included in the analysis , and the non fully hadronically decaying @xmath0 events . by applying a set of cuts on number of reconstructed b jets ( figure  [ fig : bcut ] . ) , minimum y - cut of the event jet clustering algorithm , missing energy and mass of reconstructed w as well as other parameters , one is left with what can be considered as well reconstructed hadronic @xmath0 s . at present",
    "there is no cut on muon and electron identification , however these should be added in the near future .    on these remaining events a kinematic fit is performed with constraints on total momentum , total energy and masses of the two w s .",
    "this produces a top mass peak ( figure  [ fig : mass ] . ) , which is used to perform the final selection of reconstructed hadronic @xmath0 events .",
    "the efficiency of this reconstruction is approximately 24% with a purity of 97% , where the remaining events come from the leptonic decay channels .",
    "the events that passed all the top identification criteria and that have a well tagged @xmath1 and @xmath2 jets are used to plot the b quark forward backward asymmetry .",
    "the calculated asymmetries are 0.33 + /-",
    "0.07 for the @xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : asymmetry ] . ) quark and 0.14 + /-",
    "0.09 for the @xmath1 quark . combining the results",
    "one gets 0.26 + /-",
    "0.06 ; a value consistent with the inputted standard model sample ( 0.28 ) @xcite .",
    "the results are calculated in the centre of mass frame and hence are a combination of production and decay asymmetries . by calculating the b quark asymmetry in the top quark frame one can deconvolute the two contributions ."
