    "a neural circuit in the major parts of the mammalian brain consists of excitatory principal cells and inhibitory interneurons .",
    "these interneurons are very diverse in their morphologies and functions , in contrast to the more homogeneous population of principal cells @xcite .",
    "a majority of short - range ( sr ) interneurons with mainly local connections coordinate multiple operations in principal cells , while a smaller fraction of long - range ( lr ) interneurons , with their axons distributed over large areas , innervate and coordinate all interneuron classes for generation of global synchrony in interneuronal networks @xcite . by providing a coherent oscillatory output to the principal cells ,",
    "interneuronal networks play the role of the backbones of many brain rhythms @xcite . here , we are interested in fast sparsely synchronized brain rhythms , associated with diverse cognitive functions ( e.g. , sensory perception , feature integration , selective attention , and memory formation ) @xcite . at the population level , synchronous fast oscillations ( e.g. , gamma rhythm ( 30 - 100 hz ) during awake behaving states and rapid eye movement sleep and sharp - wave ripple ( 100 - 200 hz ) during quiet sleep and awake immobility ) have been observed in local field potential recordings , while at the cellular level individual neuronal recordings have been found to exhibit stochastic and intermittent spike discharges like geiger counters @xcite .",
    "thus , for the case of sparsely synchronized rhythms , single - cell firing activity differs distinctly from the population oscillatory behavior , in contrast to fully synchronized rhythms where individual neurons fire regularly at the population frequency like clock oscillators . under the balance between strong external excitation and strong recurrent inhibition ,",
    "fast sparse synchronization was found to occur in neuronal networks for both cases of random coupling @xcite and global coupling @xcite .",
    "however , in a real neural circuit , synaptic connections are known to have complex topology which is neither regular nor completely random @xcite .    here , we are concerned about fast sparsely synchronized rhythms in a complex small - world network ( swn ) composed of two sub - populations of sr and lr interneurons : a preliminary computer modeling was done @xcite . by varying the fraction of lr interneurons @xmath0 , we study emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms . as one of complex networks , the watts - strogatz swn , which interpolates between regular lattice ( corresponding to the case of @xmath6 ) with high clustering and random graph ( corresponding to the case of @xmath7 ) with short path length via random uniform rewiring with the probability @xmath8 , has been much studied @xcite .",
    "the watts - strogatz swn may be regarded as a cluster - friendly extension of the random network by reconciling the six degrees of separation ( small - worldness ) @xcite with the circle of friends ( clustering ) .",
    "this `` canonical '' watts - strogatz swn is statistically homogeneous because individual interneurons have nearly same topological network centralities such as degree and betweenness . by increasing the rewiring probability @xmath8 ,",
    "lr connections come uniformly at random from all interneurons over the entire network .",
    "however , such lr connections are not known for the case of sr interneurons @xcite . on the other hand , lr connections appear non - uniformly from lr interneurons in the inhomogeneous swn we consider . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "lr interneurons have higher betweenness centralities @xmath9 ( characterizing the potentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons ) than sr interneurons @xcite , although they have the same average in- and out - degrees ( representing the potentiality in communication activity ) .",
    "hence , the load of communication traffic is much concentrated on a few lr interneurons .",
    "then , the lr interneurons tend to become overloaded by the communication traffic passing through them . for this case",
    ", it becomes difficult to get efficient communication between interneurons due to destructive interference between so many signals passing through the lr interneurons @xcite .",
    "however , as @xmath0 is further increased , the average betweenness centrality @xmath10 of lr interneurons decreases due to increase in the number of lr interneurons ( i.e. , because the increased number of lr interneurons share the load of communication traffic ) . in this way , as a result of increase in @xmath0 , the average path length @xmath11 ( i.e. , typical separation between two interneurons represented by average number of synapses between two interneurons along the minimal path ) becomes shorter , and the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on lr interneurons because of their decreased average betweenness centrality @xmath10 , which leads to better efficiency of global communication between interneurons .",
    "many recent works on various subjects of neurodynamics have been done in swns with predominantly local connections and rare long - distance connections @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of network topology such as the average path length and the betwenness centrality on emergence of fast sparsely synchronized rhythm by varying @xmath0 in the inhomogeneous swn and make comparison with that in the homogeneous watts - strogatz swn @xcite . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the average path length @xmath11 is very long because there exist only sr connections , and hence global communication between distant interneurons becomes ineffective .",
    "consequently , an unsynchronized population state appears .",
    "however , as @xmath0 is increased from 0 , lr connections that connect distant interneurons begin to appear non - uniformly from lr interneurons , and then the average path length @xmath11 can be dramatically decreased only by a few short - cuts .",
    "however , in the presence of only a few lr interneurons , the load of communication traffic is much concentrated on the lr interneurons with higher betweenness centralities . with further increase in @xmath0 ,",
    "the average betweenness centrality @xmath10 of lr interneurons decreases because the increased number of interneurons share the load of communication traffic .",
    "consequently , the load of communication traffic becomes less concentrated on the lr interneurons .",
    "thus , global effective communication between distant interneurons may be available via lr connections .",
    "eventually , when @xmath0 passes a small critical value @xmath1 @xmath2 , fast sparsely synchronized population rhythm emerges in the whole population because efficiency of global communication between interneurons becomes enough for occurrence of population synchronization thanks to shorter average path length @xmath11 and smaller average betweenness centrality @xmath10 of lr interneurons .",
    "this transition from desynchronization to fast sparse synchronization is well described in terms of a realistic `` thermodynamic '' order parameter , based on the instantaneous population spike rate ( ipsr ) kernel estimate @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "population synchronization emerges when @xmath14 oscillates .",
    "furthermore , through calculation of a spatial correlation function between interneurons @xcite , this type of global sparse synchronization is found to occur because dynamical correlation length between neuronal pairs covers the whole system thanks to sufficient number of lr connections . for @xmath3 , the ipsr kernel estimate",
    "@xmath13 oscillates with fast population frequency of 139 hz , while individual interneurons discharge stochastic spikes at low rates @xmath15 hz ) .",
    "this fast sparse synchronization is well characterized in terms of a realistic `` statistical - mechanical '' spiking measure , based on @xmath14 , by taking into consideration the occupation and the pacing degrees of spikes in the raster plot of spikes @xcite . with increasing @xmath0 from @xmath1 , the degree of fast",
    "sparse synchronization increases monotonically , but its increasing rate becomes slower due to appearance of sufficient number of lr connections . on the other hand , the total ( axon ) geometric wiring length continues to increase linearly with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "hence , at an optimal value @xmath4 @xmath5 , an optimal fast sparse synchronization is found to emerge through trade - off between synchronization degree and wiring cost in an economic inhomogeneous swn .",
    "these dynamical behaviors in the inhomogeneous swn are also compared with those in the watts - strogatz swn .",
    "finally , for the case of an optimal fast sparsely synchronized rhythm , we consider two cases of external time - periodic stimuli applied to sub - groups of lr and sr interneurons , respectively . then , dynamical responses to these two cases of stimuli are studied and discussed in connection with the betweenness centralities of the stimulated interneurons , representing the effectiveness for transfer of stimulation effect in the whole system .",
    "it is thus found that the degree of dynamical response ( e.g. , synchronization suppression or enhancement ) for the case of stimulated lr interneurons with higher betweenness centralities is larger ( i.e. , more suppressed or enhanced ) than that for the case of stimulated sr interneurons with lower betweenness centralities .",

    "since the transfer of stimulation effect to the non - stimulated interneurons is less effective , change in the degree of dynamical response is less made in a slow way .",
    "hence , the threshold values , @xmath333 and @xmath334 , for the 2nd and 3rd stages are larger than those for the lr - stimulated case ( i.e. , the 2nd and 3rd stages begin at larger threshold values due to the relatively slow evolution ) .",
    "particularly , the degree of dynamical response ( represented by @xmath312 ) is also reduced . in the 1st stage ,",
    "the degree of synchronization suppression is less than that for the lr - stimulated case ( i.e. , less suppressed for the case of `` sr - stimulated '' case where the value of @xmath312 is larger than that for the lr - stimulated case ) . in the 2nd stage ,",
    "the increasing rate for @xmath312 is larger for the lr - stimulated case , and when passing a threshold @xmath335 the gray line ( representing @xmath312 for the lr - stimulated case ) crosses the black line ( denoting @xmath312 for the sr - stimulated case ) .",
    "consequently , in the 2nd and 3rd stages for @xmath336 , @xmath312 for the sr - stimulated case becomes less than that for the lr - stimulated case ( i.e. , less enhanced for the sr - stimulated case ) . in this way",
    ", the degree of dynamical response ( suppression or enhancement of population synchronization ) is reduced because stimulated sr interneurons have lower betweenness centralities ( leading to less effective transfer of of stimulation effect ) . for sufficiently large @xmath25",
    ", the population synchronization is governed mainly by the external phase lockings of stimulated interneurons ( i.e. , contributions of non - stimulated interneurons to population synchronization may be negligible ) , and hence the two black and gray curves of @xmath312 for both stimulated cases approach each other one ( i.e. , synchronization enhancements for both stimulated cases become very close for sufficiently large @xmath25 ) .",
    "we considered an inhomogeneous swn composed of sr and lr interneurons . unlike the homogeneous watts - strogatz swn , lr connections appear non - uniformly from the lr interneurons . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "lr interneurons have higher betweenness centralities ( characterizing the potentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons ) than sr interneurons , although they have the same average in- and out - degrees .",
    "hence , the load of communication traffic is much concentrated on a few lr interneurons . however , with further increase in @xmath0 , the number of lr interneurons increases , they share load of communication traffic , and hence the average betweenness centrality @xmath10 of lr interneurons decreases [ i.e. , the ( group ) betweenness centralization @xmath126 also decreases ] . as a result ,",
    "the average path length @xmath11 becomes shorter , and the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on lr interneurons due to their decreased average betweenness centrality @xmath10 ( or equivalently due to decrease in the betweenness centralization @xmath126 ) , which leads to better efficiency of global communication between interneurons .",
    "we investigated the effect of the network topology ( e.g. , average path length and betweenness centrality ) on emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms with stochastic and intermittent neural discharges by varying @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , effective global communication between distant interneurons begins to become available due to appearance of lr connections from the lr interneurons .",
    "eventually , when passing a small critical value @xmath1 @xmath2 , fast sparsely synchronized rhythms have been found to emerge because efficiency of global communication between interneurons becomes enough for occurrence of population synchronization thanks to shorter average path length @xmath11 and smaller average betweenness centrality @xmath10 of lr interneurons .",
    "this transition to sparse synchronization has been well described via calculation of the realistic thermodynamic order parameter @xmath264 , based on the ipsr kernel estimate @xmath13 . for @xmath3 , the ipsr kernel estimate",
    "@xmath13 oscillates with the fast population frequency of 139 hz , while individual sr and lr interneurons discharge spikes stochastically at low rates @xmath15 hz ) . through calculation of the spatial correlation @xmath177",
    ", this type of global synchronization has been found to occur in the whole population because the spatial correlation length between neuronal pairs covers the whole system , thanks to sufficient number of lr connections .",
    "the degree of fast sparse synchronization has also been well measured in terms of the realistic statistical - mechanical spiking measure @xmath190 . with increasing @xmath0 the degree of sparse synchronization increases , but its increasing rate becomes slower due to sufficient number of lr connections . by taking into consideration the axon wiring economy ,",
    "an optimal sparsely synchronized rhythm has also been found to emerge at an optimal value @xmath4 @xmath5 via trade - off between synchronization degree and wiring cost in an economic inhomogeneous swn .",
    "the above dynamical behaviors in the inhomogeneous swn have also been compared with those in the watts - strogatz swn .",
    "we note that the watts - strogatz swn has more lr connections than the inhomogeneous swn , because lr connections for the watts - strogatz swn appear via random uniform rewiring ( which is made independently of the distance between interneurons ) , in contrast to the power - law connection probability ( decreasing slowly with respect to the distance ) for the inhomogeneous swn .",
    "thanks to the larger effect of these lr connections , sparsely synchronized rhythms have been found to appear when passing a smaller critical value @xmath288 , and the degree of sparse synchronization has also been found to become higher for the case of the watts - strogatz swn : the pacing degree ( representing the average smearing of stripes in the raster plot of spikes ) is higher , although the occupation degree ( denoting the average density of stripes ) is the same ( i.e. , ensemble - averaged mfrs are the same ) for both cases . however , with increasing @xmath0 and @xmath8 , the effect of lr connections decreases , and hence the difference in the synchronization degree for both cases becomes reduced .",
    "furthermore , as the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath8 are increased , the normalized wiring length in the watts - strogatz swn increases more rapidly ( i.e. , the increasing rate is higher ) than that in the inhomogeneous swn .",
    "hence , an optimal fast sparsely synchronized rhythm ( with the maximum dynamical efficiency given by the ratio of the synchrony degree to the normalized wiring length ) for the watts - strogatz swn appears at an optimal value @xmath296 which is smaller than the optimal value @xmath337 in the inhomogeneous swn .",
    "these differences in the dynamical behaviors in both types of swns seem to result from the difference in the connection probability .",
    "let s consider another homogeneous swn composed of identical interneurons , instead of the watts - strogatz swn .",
    "for the initial network in the case of @xmath6 , each interneuron is connected with other ones via the gaussian connection probability . with increasing @xmath8 , the rewiring from the sr to the lr connections is made with the power - law connection probability .",
    "( these connection probabilities are the same as those in the inhomogeneous swn composed of lr and sr interneurons . ) like the case of inhomogeneous swn , the critical value @xmath338 ( beyond which sparsely synchronized rhythms appear ) for this type of homogeneous swn is found to become larger than @xmath288 for the watts - strogatz swn , and it is the same as that for the inhomogeneous swn .",
    "the degree of sparse synchronization is also expected to be nearly the same as that in the inhomogeneous swn , because they have the same connection probabilities .    the main difference between the homogeneous swns and the inhomogeneous swn lies in the distributions of the betweenness centralities . unlike the homogeneous swns , dynamical responses to external ac stimulus vary depending on the type of stimulated interneurons ( lr or sr interneurons ) . for the optimal case of @xmath339 , we considered two cases of external ac stimuli applied to sub - groups of lr and sr interneurons , respectively .",
    "dynamical responses to these two cases of stimuli were investigated by varying the driving amplitude @xmath25 for a fixed driving angular frequency @xmath109 ( = 0.2 ) , and they were discussed in relation to the betweenness centralities @xmath9 of stimulated interneurons .",
    "three stages have thus been found to appear : monotonic synchronization suppression , decrease in synchronization suppression , and synchronization enhancement occur in the 1st , the 2nd , and the 3rd stages , respectively .",
    "the degree of dynamical response ( such as synchronization suppression and enhancement ) for the case of stimulated lr interneurons has been found to be larger ( i.e. , more suppressed or enhanced ) than that for the case of stimulated sr interneurons , because stimulated lr interneurons with higher betweenness centralities make transfer of stimulation effect in the whole network more effectively than stimulated sr interneurons with lower betweenness centralities .",

    "<S> we consider an inhomogeneous small - world network ( swn ) composed of inhibitory short - range ( sr ) and long - range ( lr ) interneurons , and investigate the effect of network architecture on emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms by varying the fraction of lr interneurons @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> although sr and lr interneurons have the same average in- and out - degrees ( representing the potentiality in communication activity ) , their betweenness centralities ( characterizing the potentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons ) are distinctly different . hence , in view of the betweenness , swns we consider are inhomogeneous , unlike the `` canonical '' watts - strogatz swn with nearly same betweenness centralities . for small @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the average betweenness centrality of lr interneurons is much larger than that of sr interneurons . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the load of communication traffic is much concentrated on a few lr interneurons . </S>",
    "<S> however , with further increase in @xmath0 the number of lr connections ( coming from lr interneurons ) increases , and then the average betweenness centrality of lr interneurons decreases . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the average path length becomes shorter , and the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on lr interneurons , which leads to better efficiency of global communication between interneurons . </S>",
    "<S> sparsely synchronized rhythms are thus found to emerge when passing a small critical value @xmath1 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this transition from desynchronization to sparse synchronization is well characterized in terms of a realistic `` thermodynamic '' order parameter . for @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> sparse synchronization occurs in the whole population because the spatial correlation length between neuronal pairs covers the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of sparse synchronization is also well measured in terms of a realistic `` statistical - mechanical '' spiking measure , and an optimal sparse synchronization is found to occur at an optimal value @xmath4 @xmath5 through trade - off between synchrony degree and axon wiring cost . for this optimal case , we also consider two cases of external time - periodic stimuli applied to sub - groups of lr and sr interneurons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical responses ( such as synchronization suppression and enhancement ) to these two cases of stimuli are studied and discussed in relation to the betweenness centralities of stimulated interneurons , representing the effectiveness for transfer of stimulation effect in the whole network . </S>"
