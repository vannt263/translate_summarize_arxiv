    "two successful routes that are being actually followed to produce magnetic organic materials @xcite are the addition of magnetic atoms @xcite and the use of polyradicals @xcite . in particular , carbon - based nickel compounds that show spontaneous field - dependent magnetization and hysteresis at room temperature ,",
    "have been recently synthesized @xcite . moreover",
    ", the combination of two radical modules with different spins has allowed the obtaining of organic polymers with ferro- or antiferromagnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "research on molecules containing polyradicals goes back to the early nineties @xcite and has produced a variety of results as , for example , the synthesis of high spin organic molecules . in some of these molecules the failure of hund s rule has been demonstrated @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental and theoretical evidence has been recently presented indicating that 5-dehydro - m - xylylene or dmx was the first example of an organic tri - radical with an open - shell doublet ground - state@xcite .",
    "both methods share a common strategy : the use of ingredients ( either radicals or atoms ) that provide a finite spin .    in this work",
    "we follow a different approach .",
    "specifically , we predict the existence of spin polarized organic molecules derived from non magnetic @xmath0-conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) by selective hydrogenation of their peripheral c atoms .",
    "high hydrogenation of pahs has been proposed as a method for hydrogen storage @xcite .",
    "more recently , the feasibility of double hydrogenation of those compounds has been investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "our work is inspired upon lieb s theorem for bipartite lattices that shows the appearance of magnetism whenever they are unbalanced @xcite . according to lieb , if a nearest neighbor model with a local on - site interaction is applicable to a bipartite lattice , the spin multiplicity of the ground state is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the number of atoms in each sublattice .",
    "most pahs are alternant hydrocarbons where carbon atoms can be separated into two disjoint subsets so that an atom in one set only has neighbors in the other set ( figs .",
    "1 and 2 show a colored version of the partition ) . the same theorem has been used to support the existence of magnetism in graphene ribbons and islands @xcite .",
    "all work we know is based on single - determinantal methods , i.e. , on a more or less sophisticated form of self - consistent - field ( scf ) calculation .",
    "let us remark that being @xmath0-orbital magnetism a direct result of the strong correlation among @xmath0-electrons , only methods designed explicitly to catch these effects ( like cisd and mcscf , used in our work ) can help to resolve the doubts regarding the appearance of magnetism in graphite - derived systems .     according to its symmetry group ) , 1,3,5,7,9,11-hexahydrocoronene ( b , hereafter referred to as @xmath4 ) and planar 1,4,5,6,7,10-hexahydrocorannulene ( c , hereafter referred to as @xmath5 ) .",
    "saturated carbon atoms are represented by black symbols while dark gray ( magenta ) and light gray symbols are used to distinguish carbon atoms belonging to different sublattices .",
    "corannulene is a non - alternant hydrocarbon , that is , a frustrated cluster of carbon atoms ( note the fully magenta bond between two magenta atoms ) . ]",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the _ ab initio _ methods ( both mono- and multi - determinantal ) used in this work are discussed in some detail in section ii , while the results obtained with those methods are reported and discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv in turn is devoted to the analysis of the _ ab initio _",
    "results by means of model hamiltonians , in particular the hubbard and the pariser - parr - pople hamiltonians .",
    "finally , the conclusions of our work are gathered in section v.    ) . as in fig .",
    "1 , black symbols indicate carbon atoms forming only single bonds while dark gray ( magenta ) and light gray symbols denote each of the two sublattices in which carbon atoms can be separated . ]    .",
    "total energies ( in hartrees ) for atomic hydrogen , molecular hydrogen , coronene c@xmath6h@xmath7 , corannulene c@xmath8h@xmath9 , two molecules obtained from hexahydrogenation of coronene and one derived from hexahydrogenation of corannulene ( in the latter case the results correspond to the planar geometry shown in fig .",
    "the results were obtained using three basis sets ( midi , cc - pvdz and cc - pvtz ) , two scf methods ( rhf and rb3lyp ) and one multi - configurational method cisd . the number of occupied ( m ) and empty ( n ) @xmath0 molecular orbitals included in the cisd calculations as well as the number of electrons that fill them ( n ) is indicated as ( m+n , n ) .",
    "small stars emphasize the spin multiplicity of the more stable state . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : energy - md ]",
    "total energies for the singlet and the relevant multiplet of hydrogenated coronene @xmath10 , @xmath4 and planar hydrogenated corannulene @xmath5 ( a , b and c in fig . 1 ) are reported in table i. it is first noted that whereas the energies obtained with the small basis set midi and those obtained with the already large cc - pvdz , differ in 4 - 6 hartrees ( approximately 0.6% ) , the difference is reduced to 0.1 - 0.3 hartrees ( approximately 0.02% ) when cc - pvdz is replaced by the largest basis used in this work , namely , the cc - pvtz basis set .",
    "this indicates that convergence , as far as the basis set is concerned , is rather acceptable . in the case of hexahydrogenated coronene ( briefly 6h - coronene ) , results clearly show that , no matter the method or the basis set used , the ground state of molecule @xmath10 is a septuplet and that of molecule @xmath4 a singlet .",
    "we have checked that other spin states lie between those two . in molecule @xmath10 the largest energy difference between the high spin ground state and the singlet occurs for rhf ( 0.23 - 0.26 hartrees ) .",
    "this difference is reduced to approximately 0.1 hartrees for rb3lyp , increasing again using the cisd method . on the other hand , all results for @xmath4 conformation show that the singlet is below the septuplet by more than 0.2 hartrees .",
    "similar results are obtained for 6h - corannulene , although energy differences are slightly smaller .",
    "table i also reports total energy results for atomic and molecular hydrogen , coronene and corannulene that allow the calculation of fragmentation energies ( table ii analysis ) .",
    "these are negative relative to atomic hydrogen but not relative to the molecular form",
    ". therefore , actual synthesis of the hydrogenated molecules would need sophisticated reaction paths @xcite .",
    "we also note that the singlet ground state of @xmath4 hydrogenated coronene is more stable than that of the molecule having a septuplet ground state ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "presumably , other forms of 6h - corannulene would also show deeper ground state energies than that of the studied magnetic conformation .",
    "note also that hydrogenation of the curved ( stable ) geometry of corannulene ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is slightly less favorable than that of its planar geometry ( compare results for @xmath5 and @xmath11 in table ii ) .",
    "anyhow , as in the planar geometry , the quintuplet has a lower energy than the singlet .",
    "3 depicts the total spin densities of the septuplet states ( s=3 ) of 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexahydrocoronene and 1,3,5,7,9,11-hexahydrocoronene ( a and b ) and the quintuplet ( s=2 ) of planar 1,4,5,6,7,10-hexahydrocorannulene . concerning 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexahydrocoronene",
    ", the most appealing result is that the spin density is finite only on the carbon atoms of one sublattice .",
    "more precisely , spin density is located in the sublattice to which no additional h atoms were attached .",
    "this result is highly illustrative allowing some intuition on the reasons for a magnetic ground state : electron - electron repulsion is minimized because each electron avoids sitting at nearest - neighbors distances from the others .",
    "however , in 1,3,5,7,9,11-hexahydrocoronene , a molecule with a singlet ground state , the spin is equally spread over the two sublattices implying larger electronic repulsions at the central hexagon .",
    "the case of 1,4,5,6,7,10-hexahydrocorannulene is even more interesting as , being a frustrated molecule , at least one bond between atoms of the same sublattice should be present .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "3 once a sublattice is identified as the sites showing spin density while the rest belong to the other sublattice ( colors in fig .",
    "1 have anticipated this feature ) .",
    "we will show later that the model hamiltonian calculations for 1,4,5,6,7,10-hexahydrocorannulene show frustration at the same bond than _ ab initio _ calculations ( compare figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "having identified the atoms at each sublattice , it is tempting to use the unbalance in the molecule ( @xmath12=4 ) to predict the total spin of the ground state using lieb s formula . the result ( s=2 )",
    "is in perfect agreement with numerical results .",
    "this is particularly interesting as in principle lieb s theorem should only work on non - frustrated systems .",
    "spin multiplicity of the ground state of a molecule is usually predicted by means of hund rule applied to mo energies obtained by an appropriate method .",
    "we have checked that the spin of the ground states of the molecules here investigated is consistent with the degeneracy of the homo that hckel s method gives for the skeleton of c atoms having an unsaturated @xmath0 orbital .",
    "this is true not only for 6h - coronene , but also for 6h - corannulene .",
    "although the extended hckel s method used by _ ab initio _ codes to initialize the self - consistency process slightly lifts this degeneracy , the homo still appears as a narrow bunch containing a number of orbitals compatible with the spin of the ground states of the three planar molecules depicted in fig .",
    ", as in hund rule , such a distribution of molecular orbitals favors high spin ground states through a winning competition of interaction energy gains against kinetic energy losses .",
    "let us critically examine the applicability of lieb s theorem as the predicting tool of the multiplicity of the ground state of hydrogenated pahs .",
    "the underlying hubbard model ignores that : ( i ) transfer integrals in any realistic system are not limited to nearest neighbors sites , ( ii ) @xmath13orbitals appear around the homo - lumo gap in the same energy interval as @xmath0orbitals , ( iii ) interaction among electrons is not limited to on - site coulomb repulsion . in our opinion ,",
    "the success of a theorem or rule based on the simplest interacting model comes from its actual capability of describing the correct antiferromagnetic spin - spin correlations between nearest @xmath0 electrons .",
    "strong correlation is the basis for the basic correctness of a simplified image in which up and down spins alternate @xcite .",
    "even if the spin multiplicity of the ground state is predicted either by hund rule or lieb s theorem , a deeper understanding of underlying correlations calls for a complete numerical solution of simple interacting models .",
    "we have analyzed both pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) model hamiltonian @xcite and the local version of hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , which actually is a particular case of the former .",
    "the ppp hamiltonian contains a non - interacting part @xmath14 and a term that incorporates the electron - electron interactions @xmath15 :    @xmath16    the non - interacting term is written as ,    @xmath17    where the operator @xmath18 creates an electron at site @xmath19 with spin @xmath13 , @xmath20 is the energy of carbon @xmath0orbital , and @xmath21 is the hopping between nearest neighbor pairs ( kinetic energy ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the number of unsaturated c atoms .",
    "the interacting part is in turn given by ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the on - site coulomb repulsion and @xmath25 is the inter - site coulomb repulsion , while the density operator is    @xmath26    this hamiltonian reduces to the hubbard model for @xmath25=0    we start discussing the fitting of spin state energies by means of hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "lanczos algorithm in the whole hilbert occupation space is used to get numerically exact many - body states @xcite .",
    "coulomb on - site repulsion has been adjusted to describe spin excitations of some pahs . because the interacting model can not be solved exactly for 6h - coronene (",
    "18 orbitals or equivalently sites lead to a hilbert occupation space of dimension equal to @xmath27 which is beyond actual computational facilities ) , the case of a coronene molecule with all peripheral c atoms saturated by additional h has been considered .",
    "this leaves a molecule with only 12 @xmath0 orbitals , a cluster size that can be easily handled by means of lanczos algorithm . also benzene ( 6 sites ) ,",
    "anthracene ( 14 sites ) and 6h - corannulene ( 14 sites ) have been fitted .",
    "calculations were carried out by taking the hopping integral commonly used to describe graphene sheets , @xmath28 ev , and varying the on - site repulsion @xmath24 .",
    "the results depicted in the left panel of fig . 4 indicate that spin states of these molecules can be reasonably fitted with @xmath29 ev ( benzene , for which the fitting is as good as for anthracene , is not shown for the sake of clarity ) .",
    "albeit noticeable deviations occur in the three lowest lying states of 6h - corannulene , the state ordering is the correct one .",
    "we have checked that the failure to correctly separate the lower excitations of 6h - corannulene is not exclusive of the simplest interacting model : a ppp calculation using ohno s interpolation scheme @xcite shows a similar weakness .",
    "let us remark once more that , despite the rather small @xmath24 ( @xmath30 ) resulting from the fittings shown in fig .",
    "4 , anti - ferromagnetic correlations in these molecules , as calculated by means of the interacting model , are significant .",
    "particularly attracting is the case of corannulene for which there is a bond at which the spin - spin correlation is significantly smaller than at other bonds of the molecule ( top right panel of fig .",
    "4 ) . interestingly enough , placing frustration ( two adjacent @xmath0 orbitals of the same sublattice as shown in fig .",
    "1c ) at that bond gives a difference between carbon atoms in the two sublattices of four atoms , which , using lieb s formula , predicts a ground state of total spin 2 , in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "summarizing , @xmath24 = 3.3 ev works satisfactorily describing the spin states of aromatic molecules and , in particular , the multiplicity of the ground state .",
    "the same simple hubbard model fails , however , in describing the charged states of these systems as results for benzene show ( bottom right panel of fig .",
    "2 ) . lanczos results for the interacting hamiltonian are compared with b3lyp results for a charged benzene ideally restricted to a fixed geometric structure .",
    "actual energy differences are much higher than those predicted by the model .",
    "our results do also illustrate the lack of electron - hole symmetry that characterizes any realistic self - consistent field calculation as opposed to lieb s model . the ppp model with @xmath28 ev and values for the coulomb repulsion integrals from ref .",
    ", although greatly improves the fitting , still gives a symmetric curve by the well - known pairing between occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals .",
    "a full fitting of charge and spin states will surely require including a larger number of parameters @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a new route to produce magnetic organic molecules that consists of hydrogenating pahs . in the case of alternant pahs the spin multiplicities of the molecules ground states agree with lieb s prediction , even though _ ab initio _",
    "hamiltonians may significantly differ from hubbard s model .",
    "a probably related result is that _ ab initio _ energies of the spin states of these molecules can be very satisfactorily fitted by means of the simplest version of the hubbard model .",
    "it seems that the molecule topology is enough support for the main result .",
    "energies of charged molecules , instead , can not be described by the simple , most popular , interacting models , suggesting a critical examination of their use in , for instance , graphene .",
    "results for total spin densities in molecules having a magnetic ground state clearly show that the spin is localized in only one of the two sublattices . on the other hand , _ ab initio _ and model hamiltonian calculations for hydrogenated corannulene ,",
    "place the frustrated bond at the same location .",
    "this produces an unbalance in the molecule which , using lieb s formula , gives s=2 for the ground state of the molecule , in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "it is also worth noting that in a recent study @xcite we have shown that dehydrogenation may also produce magnetic molecules .",
    "although dehydrogenation is a highly unlikely process , dehydrogenated pahs have been intensively investigated by astrophysicists @xcite who believe they to form part of interstellar matter .",
    "although the results presented here are encouraging , there is still a long way to go : finding procedures to synthesize these hydrogenated pahs and crystallize them into solids that may eventually show magnetic properties .",
