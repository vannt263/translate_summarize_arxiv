    "our database of the electronic open market sibe ( sistema de interconexin burstil electrnico ) allows us to follow each transaction performed by all the firms registered at bme . in 2004",
    "the bme was the eight in the world in market capitalization .",
    "we consider the stocks banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria ( bbva ) , banco santander central hispano ( san ) , and telefnica ( tef ) .",
    "we also consider only the most active firms defined by the criterion that each firm made at least @xmath33 trades / year and was active at least @xmath34 days per year .",
    "the number of firms is @xmath35 ( bbva ) , @xmath36 ( san ) , and @xmath37 ( tef ) .",
    "these firms are involved in @xmath38 of the transactions .",
    "the investigated period is 2001 - 2004 .",
    "we do not consider other stocks because we have verified that the number of detected patches is too small to perform careful statistical estimation .",
    "the series under study is the series of signed traded value . for each firm and for each stock",
    "we construct the series composed by all the trades performed by the firm with a value @xmath39 for a buy trade and @xmath40 for a sell trade , where @xmath41 is the value ( in euros ) of the traded shares .",
    "the method we use to detect statistically the presence of patches is adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite where it was introduced to study patchiness non - stationarity of human heart rate .",
    "the algorithm works as follows .",
    "one moves a sliding pointer along the signal and computes the mean of the subset of the signal to the left and to the right of the pointer . from these mean values",
    "one computes a @xmath42 statistics and finds the position of the pointer for which the @xmath42 statistics is maximal .",
    "the significance level of this value of @xmath42 is defined as the probability of obtaining it or a smaller value in a random sequence .",
    "one then chooses a threshold ( in our case @xmath43 ) and the sequence is cut if the significance level is smaller than the threshold .",
    "the cut position is the boundary between two consecutive patches .",
    "the procedure continues recursively on the left and right subset created by each cut . before a new cut",
    "is accepted one also computes @xmath42 between the right - hand new segment and its right neighbor and @xmath42 between the left - hand new segment and its left neighbor and one checks if both values of @xmath42 are statistically significant according to the selected threshold .",
    "the process stops when it is not possible to make new cut with the selected significance .    in the present study ,",
    "we are mainly interested in directional patches , i.e. patches where the trader consistently buys or sells a large amount of shares . in other words",
    "we wish to exclude patches in which the inventory of the firm is diffusing randomly , without a drift . to this end for each patch",
    "we compute the total value purchased @xmath44 , the total value sold @xmath45 and the total value @xmath46 .",
    "we then consider a patch as directional when either @xmath47 ( buy patch ) or @xmath48 ( sell patch ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 can be varied and in the present study we set it to @xmath50 .",
    "we obtain similar results for different values of @xmath49 such as @xmath51 and @xmath17 . finally in the present paper we consider patches with at least @xmath18 trades .",

    "<S> the dynamics of many socioeconomic systems is determined by the decision making process of agents . </S>",
    "<S> the decision process depends on agent s characteristics , such as preferences , risk aversion , behavioral biases , etc . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in some systems the size of agents can be highly heterogeneous leading to very different impacts of agents on the system dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large size of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control their impact , either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding their intentionality . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the financial market as a model system , and we study empirically how agents strategically adjust the properties of large orders in order to meet their preference and minimize their impact . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify this strategic behavior by detecting scaling relations of allometric nature @xcite between the variables characterizing the trading activity of different institutions . </S>",
    "<S> we observe power law distributions in the investment time horizon , in the number of transactions needed to execute a large order and in the traded value exchanged by large institutions and we show that heterogeneity of agents is a key ingredient for the emergence of some aggregate properties characterizing this complex system .    </S>",
    "<S> in many complex systems agents self organize themselves in an ecology of different  species \" interacting in a variety of ways . </S>",
    "<S> agents are not only different in their strategies , information , and preferences , but they can be very different in their size . </S>",
    "<S> examples include individual s wealth @xcite and firms size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of agents with large size poses several challenging questions . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that large agents impacts the system in a way that is significantly different from small ones . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , small agents can easily hide their intentionality , while for large agents this is not so easy and they must adopt strategies taking into account their own effect because revealing their intention could decrease their fitness .    </S>",
    "<S> financial markets are an ideal system to investigate this problem . </S>",
    "<S> there is empirical evidence that market participants are very heterogeneous in size . </S>",
    "<S> for example banks @xcite and mutual funds @xcite size follow zipf s law , i.e. the probability that the size of a participant is larger than @xmath0 decays as @xmath1 @xcite . as a consequence large investors usually need to trade large quantities that can significantly affect prices . </S>",
    "<S> the associated cost is called market impact @xcite . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> large investors refrain from revealing their demand or supply and they typically trade their large orders incrementally over an extended period of time . these large orders are called _ packages _ @xcite or _ hidden orders _ and are split in smaller trades as the result of a complex optimization procedure which takes into account the investor s preference , risk aversion , investment horizon , etc ..    here we investigate the trading activity of a large fraction of the financial firms exchanging a financial asset at the spanish stock market ( bolsas y mercados espaoles , bme ) in the period 2001 - 2004 ( see materials and methods section for a description of data ) . </S>",
    "<S> firms are credit entities and investment firms which are members of the stock exchange and are entitled to trade in the market .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach aims to be a comprehensive approach analysing the overall dynamics of all packages exchanged in the market . </S>",
    "<S> however , our database does not contain direct information on packages , so that this information must be statistically inferred from the available data . since we do not have information on clients but only on firms , we develop a detection algorithm ( see material and methods for a description of the algorithm ) which is not sensible to small fluctuation in the buy / sell activity of a firm . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm detects time segments in the inventory time evolution of a firm when the firm acts as a net buyer or seller at an approximately constant rate . </S>",
    "<S> we call these segments _ patches _ and we assume that in each of these patches it is contained at least one package .    since firms act simultaneously as brokers for many clients , it is rather frequent that in a patch not all the transactions have the same sign . </S>",
    "<S> however , a vast majority of firm inventory time series can be partitioned in patches with a well defined direction to buy or to sell . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably due to the fact that in most cases the trading activity of a firm is dominated by the activity of one big client . </S>",
    "<S> we consider _ directional patches _ , i.e. patches with a well defined direction ( see figure  [ series ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characterizing variables of a directional patch are the time length @xmath2 ( in seconds ) of the patch , measured as the time interval between the first and the last order of the patch , the traded value @xmath3 and the number @xmath4 of trades characterizing the patch . for example , @xmath4 is the number of buy trades and @xmath3 is the purchased value for buy patches .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate first the distributional properties of the patches identified by our algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ distrib ] shows the distribution of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 for the three investigated stocks . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of all the three distributions can be approximated by a power law function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 can be @xmath2 , @xmath4 , or @xmath3 and @xmath7 is the exponent characterizing the power law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> a summary of the estimated exponents is shown in table  [ summary ] from which one can conclude that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis makes explicit the presence of very broad distribution for the three variables characterizing a patch . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the very low value of the exponents is consistent with the conclusion that @xmath2 and @xmath4 belong to the domain of lvy stable distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that in the market there is a huge heterogeneity in the scales characterizing the trading profile of the investors .    </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the packages is likely to be related to the size of the investors . </S>",
    "<S> large investors need to trade large packages to rebalance their portfolio . </S>",
    "<S> gabaix _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite developed a theory which predicts that package size should be power law distributed with an exponent @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the value we find for @xmath12 is slightly larger than the one predicted by them . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath13 derived by the theory in @xcite is significantly larger than our estimate ( @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the power law distribution of packages time length @xmath2 might reflect the heterogeneity of time scales among investors . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of @xmath2 is compatible with the ones obtained by using specialized database describing the investment packages of large investors @xcite ( see figure  [ distrib ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ summary ]    the role of size heterogeneity in the emergence of power law distributions will be considered at the end of the paper . to complete our characterization of firm patches , </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the relation between the variables characterizing each patch . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , by applying the principal component analysis ( pca ) to the set of points with coordinates @xmath19 , we investigate the allometric relations between any two of the above variables , i.e. @xmath20 figure  [ scatter ] shows the scatter plots and the contour plots for the stock telefnica . in all three cases a clear dependence between the variables is seen . </S>",
    "<S> pca analysis shows that the first eigenvalue explains on average @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 of the variance for the first , second , and third allometric relation , respectively , indicating a strong correlation between the variables . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated exponents ( see table  [ summary ] ) are consistent for different stocks so that the allometric relations are @xmath24 the presence of scaling relations between the variables were first suggested in ref .  @xcite but it is worth noting that the theory developed in that paper predicts @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and these values are quite different from the ones we estimate from data . </S>",
    "<S> the first allometric relation indicates that the number of transactions in which a package is split is approximately proportional to the total traded value of the package . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the mean transaction volume is roughly independent on the size of the package . </S>",
    "<S> this mean value is on average determined by the size of the available volume at the best quote indicating that the trader does not trade orders larger than the volume available at the best quote , probably to avoid being too aggressive @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the relation between the three variables together by performing a pca on the set of points describing the patches and identified by the coordinates @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the set of points effectively lies on a two dimensional manifold which has one dimension much larger than the other . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the first eigenvalue is large indicates that one factor dominates the trading strategy . </S>",
    "<S> the allometric relations of the three variables associated with the first eigenvalue of the pca provides an estimation of the exponents ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for telefnica ) which , differently than in the bivariate case , are of course coherent among them and only slightly different from the ones obtained from the bivariate analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> we now go back to the problem of assessing the role of firm heterogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> the first scientific question is : is the fat tailed distribution of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 due to the fact that individual firms place heterogeneously sized packages or is this an effect of the aggregation of many different firms together ? to answer this question we test the hypothesis that the patches identified for a given firm trading a given stock are lognormally distributed . </S>",
    "<S> the test ( see table  [ summary ] ) shows that for most of the trading firms we can not reject the hypothesis that the patches have characteristics sizes distributed as a lognormal . </S>",
    "<S> since we reject the lognormal hypothesis for the pool obtained by considering all the firms , we conclude that the power law distribution of @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 is due to an heterogeneity in patch scale _ between _ different firms rather that _ within _ each firm . the second scientific question about concerns the role of firm heterogeneity for scaling laws . to assess the role of heterogeneity , for each firm we compute the exponents @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 of the bivariate relations of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ scaling ] ( see insets of fig .  [ scatter ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the exponents obtained for each firm are distributed around the corresponding value of the exponent obtained for the pool . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the bivariate allometric relations are not an effect of the aggregation but are observed , on average , also for individual firms .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> our comprehensive investigation of packages traded at bme shows that heterogeneity of firms has an essential role for the emergence of power law tails in the investment time horizon , in the number of transactions and in the traded value exchanged by packages . </S>",
    "<S> differently , scaling laws between the variables characterizing each package are essentially the same across different firms with the possible exception of the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 perhaps reflecting different degree of aggressiveness of firms . </S>"
