    "cosmic rays are energetic charged particles traveling throughout the galaxy and the intergalactic medium under the influence of various physical processes , including deflection by magnetic fields , and collisions with other particles along their trajectory .",
    "their energy spectrum measured at earth is a steep ( roughly power - law ) distribution with logarithmic index @xmath43 , extending up to a few times @xmath1 ev .",
    "other than their spectrum , these particles are characterized by their angular distribution in the sky , and by their mass composition .",
    "a highly significant steepening in the uhecr spectrum was reported by both the hires ( abbasi et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xcite collaborations .",
    "( distinguished from their lower - energy counterparts , uhecrs have energies in excess of 1 eev @xmath5 ev . )",
    "this result may be a strong confirmation of the predicted greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff due to photohadronic interactions between the uhecrs and low - energy photons in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ) .",
    "together with the measured low fraction of high - energy photons in the cr distribution , this measurement already rules out so - called top - down models , in which the uhecrs represent the decay products of high - mass dark matter particles created in the early universe ( semikoz et al .",
    "the measured photon flux is also in conflict with scenarios in which uhecrs are produced by collisions between cosmic strings or topological defects ( bluemer et al .",
    "2008 , auger 2008b ) . on the other hand , such energetic particles may still be produced via astrophysical acceleration mechanisms ( see torres & anchordoqui 2004 and other references cited therein ) .",
    "uhecrs are not detected directly , but through the showers they create in earth s atmosphere ( see , e.g. , melia 2009 ) . depending on the energy and type of primary particle , the ensuing cascade has characteristics that allow the ground - based observatories to determine not only whether the incoming uhecr is a photon , but also its atomic number .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that a determination of the primaries composition strongly relies on an extrapolation of current phenomenological hadronic interaction models , so it remains rather uncertain .",
    "the @xcite data confirmed the dominance of protons in primary cosmic rays , though they also exhibit evidence for a mixed composition extending to energies as high as @xmath6 5060 eev , with a higher atomic number @xmath7 , up to @xmath8 ( unger et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "but the most telling indicator for the possible origin of these uhecrs is the discovery by auger ( auger 2008a ) of their clustering towards nearby ( @xmath9 mpc ) agns along the supergalactic plane .",
    "the significance of this correlation has been further strenghtened by a more recent analysis which weights the agn spatial distribution by their hard x - ray flux ( george et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this raises at least two questions : ( 1 ) how are the uhecrs accelerated to such high energies ? and",
    "( 2 ) given these nearby sources , is the sharp suppression of uhecrs in the last decade of their observed energies really due solely to the gzk effect , or does it signal a limitation to the acceleration efficiency ?",
    "previous attempts at understanding how particles are accelerated to eev energies and beyond have generally been based on first - order fermi acceleration ( see , e.g. , ostrowski 2008 , and other references therein ) within shocks created by blast waves like those in supernova remnants ( fatuzzo & melia 2003 , crocker et al . 2005 ) .",
    "but this process is subject to kinematic restrictions that inhibit the particles from actually reaching ultra - high energies ( see , e.g. , nayakshin & melia 1998 , gallant et al .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown that an increase in the lorentz factor @xmath10 of ultra - relativistic shock waves steepens the observed spectrum ( niemiec & ostrowski 2006 ) and reduces its high - energy cutoff .",
    "for these reasons , it is not plausible for uhecrs to emerge from astrophysical environments , such as supernova remnants , where first - order processes are dominant so long as the shock velocity is super - alfvnic , because they can not even contain such high - energy particles ( hillas 1984)the gyration radius of particles with energy @xmath2 ev for a typical galactic magnetic field is much larger than the size ( @xmath11 pc ) of these structures .",
    "on the other hand , a second - order fermi process ( fermi 1949 ) can explain observational features not addressed by the first - order process , as in the case of a supernova remnant itself ( see cowsik & sarkar 1984 ) .",
    "moreover , stochastic particle acceleration through a gyroresonant interaction with mhd turbulence ( a second - order fermi process ; see fermi 1949 ) can be very efficient if the alfvn velocity approaches @xmath12 ( dermer & humi 2001 ) . the stochastic acceleration of particles by turbulent plasma waves has already received some attention in the literature ( see liu et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 , and references cited therein , and wolfe & melia 2006 ) .",
    "indeed , the feasibility of second - order fermi acceleration in radio galaxies has been demonstrated through the steady re - acceleration of electrons in certain hot spots ( almudena prieto et al .",
    "2002 ) .    our treatment from first principles , however , avoids many of the previously encountered unknowns and limitations . in this paper , we report ( to our knowledge ) the first treatment of stochastic acceleration of charged particles in the lobes of radio - bright agns by directly computing the trajectory of individual particles . an earlier version of this treatment  for the propagation of charged particles assumed already accelerated at tev energy through the turbulent magnetic field at the galactic centre  may be found in ballantyne et al .",
    "2007 , and wommer , melia & fatuzzo 2008 ; by contrast , in the present paper both the propagation and acceleration are taken into account .",
    "we show that random scatterings ( a second - order fermi process ) between the charges and fluctuations in a turbulent magnetic field can accelerate these particles up to ultra - high energies , provided a broad range of fluctuations is present in the system .",
    "in our treatment , we follow the three - dimensional motion of _ individual _ particles within a time - varying turbulent magnetic field . by avoiding the use of equations describing statistical averages of the particle distribution , we mitigate our dependence on unknown factors , such as the diffusion coefficient",
    ". we also avoid such limitations as the parker approximation ( padmanhaban 2001 ) in the transport equation .",
    "however , a remaining unknown is the partitioning between turbulent and background fields . for simplicity",
    ", we take the minimalist approach and assume that the magnetic energy is divided equally between the two components .",
    "another unknown is the turbulent distribution . for many real astrophysical plasmas",
    ", the magnetic turbulence seems to be in accordance with the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "this is seen , e.g. , in the solar wind ( leamon et al .",
    "1998 ) and through interstellar scintillation ( lee & jokipii 1976 ) ; a more recent numerical analysis of mhd turbulence confirms the general validity of the kolmogorov power spectrum ( cho et al . 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , renormalization group techniques applied to the analysis of mhd turbulence also favour a kolmogorov power spectrum ( for more details , see smith et al .",
    "1998 , and verma 2004 ) .",
    "we model the radio lobe of an agn as a sphere of radius @xmath13 , a second parameter in our simulations .",
    "a population of relativistic particles of mass @xmath14 , protons or heavy ions , with an energy @xmath15 , where @xmath10 is the lorentz factor , is released in an inner sphere of radius @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 must be much smaller than 1 , otherwise very few particles reach an energy @xmath18ev . for a small value of @xmath17 , the gyration radius becomes comparable to the size of the acceleration region at @xmath18ev , and therefore changes in @xmath17 do not significantly alter the result .",
    "for the sake of specificity , we use a value @xmath19 in this paper .",
    "once released , the particles propagate through the turbulent field until they escape the acceleration region and enter intergalactic space .",
    "we use the @xcite prescription for generating the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "their principal aim of propagating individual particles through a magnetostatic field was to compute the fokker - planck coefficients for a direct comparison with analytic theory . for our purpose , we modify that prescription to include a time - dependent phase factor that allows for temporal variations .    the global magnetic field is written as a sum of a background term @xmath20 , constant and uniform , and a turbulent field varying in space and time ( i.e. , as a superposition of alfvn waves ) .",
    "the equation of motion of a relativistic test particle with charge @xmath21 and mass @xmath14 moving in an electromagnetic field @xmath22 is the lorentz equation ( landau & lifchitz 1975 , melia 2001 ) @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) , where @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath25 is the four - velocity of the particle , @xmath26 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath27 is the proper time .",
    "we calculate the trajectory of the particle in a magnetic field @xmath28 as a solution of the space components ( @xmath29 ) of equation ( 1 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the time in the rest frame of the acceleration region . the quantity @xmath32 in equation ( [ lorentz ] )",
    "is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , in terms of the background magnetic field @xmath20 , and @xmath35 is the time - dependent turbulent magnetic field .",
    "we ignore any large - scale background electric fields  a reasonable assumption given that currents would quench any such fields within the radio lobes of agns .",
    "the time variation of the magnetic field , however , induces an electric field @xmath36 according to faraday s law .",

    "further assumptions are necessary to specify the dispersion relation @xmath59 . for every turbulent mode",
    ", we use the dispersion relation for transverse non - relativistic alfvn waves ( see kaplan & tsytovich 1973 for an extended discussion ) : @xmath60 , for @xmath39 , where @xmath61 is the non - relativistic alfvn velocity in a medium with background magnetic field @xmath62 and number density @xmath63 , @xmath64 the proton mass , and @xmath65 is the angle between the wavevector @xmath38 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is the condition thought to be valid for the propagation of turbulent modes in a magnetized astrophysical environment , such as the radio lobes of an agn .",
    "the background plasma is assumed to have a background proton number density @xmath66 @xmath67 , a reasonable value for these environments ( almudena prieto et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the magnetic fluctuations are assumed to be consistent with kolmogorov turbulence , so @xmath68 for @xmath39 , where @xmath69 corresponds to the longest wavelength of the fluctuations and the index @xmath70 of the power spectrum @xmath71 is @xmath72 . finally , the quantity @xmath73 is computed by requiring that the energy density of the magnetic fluctuations equals that of the background magnetic field : @xmath74 we choose n=2400 values of @xmath51 evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale ; i.e. , a wavenumber shell with bounds @xmath75 holds @xmath76 values .",
    "considering that the turbulence wavenumber @xmath51 is related to the turbulent length scale @xmath77 by @xmath78 , we adopt a range of lengthscales from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the initial velocity of the particle and @xmath82 is the initial gyrofrequency in the background magnetic field .",
    "thus the dynamic range covered by @xmath51 is @xmath83 , and our description allows for @xmath84 transverse modes @xmath51 per decade .",
    "the values of @xmath85 and @xmath69 fix the magnetic energy equipartition through equation ( 10 ) .",
    "the value @xmath86 is proportional through a factor of order @xmath87 to the correlation length of the turbulence ( see ruffert and melia 1994 , and rockefeller et al .",
    "2004 , for examples of how this is generated in the interstellar medium ) ; the value @xmath88 is the wavelength at which the interaction between the turbulence and most of the particles is the most efficient , so that energy is drained out of @xmath89 .",
    "however , since the gyroradius @xmath90 evolves over a large energy interval , the gyroresonant wavenumber @xmath91 moves accordingly in such a way that in the global wavenumber interval @xmath92 there is for every @xmath93 a certain @xmath91 fulfilling the resonance condition @xmath94 .",
    "such a @xmath51 range involves a large computational time , especially if a statistically significant number of particles is to be considered .    since our numerical simulation is not performed by specifying the magnetic turbulence on a computational grid with given cell size @xmath95 , the choice of @xmath96 is not dictated by a fixed spatial resolution ( see section [ num ] for more details ) .",
    "in addition , the result is not affected by spurious effects to the discreteness or the periodicity . as a byproduct",
    ", the divergenceless condition @xmath42 is easily satisfied and does not require an extension of the godunov solver of the mhd equations for the purpose of `` divergence cleaning '' ( ryu et al .",
    "1998 ) or a reformulation of the mhd equations including , e.g. , divergence - damping terms ( dedner et al .",
    "2002 ) .    with this prescription ,",
    "we construct the turbulent magnetic field at every point of physical space where the particle is found , which we then propagate without taking any time - average along the trajectory .",
    "the particles passing through this region are released initially at a random position inside the acceleration zone , which for simplicity is taken to be a sphere of radius @xmath13 , with a fixed initial velocity @xmath81 pointed in a random direction .",
    "the initial value of the lorentz factor @xmath97 is chosen to avoid having to deal with ionization losses for the protons or heavy ions .",
    "the particles closest to the edge of the acceleration zone have a higher probability of escaping than those starting farther in , and therefore reach relatively lower energies . in the usual ( fermi ) way , this produces ( in the highest energy portion of the spectrum ) an inverted power - law distribution .      in principle ,",
    "energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse compton processes involving radio and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , all of which increase as @xmath98 , can significantly limit the maximum energy attainable by a cosmic ray during the acceleration process , given that its lorentz factor @xmath10 evolves from @xmath99 up to @xmath100 . for an uhe particle ( either a proton or a heavy ion ) , both the radio and cmb photons will have an energy @xmath101 in the centre - of - momentum frame well below the rest energy of the cosmic ray ( i.e. , @xmath102 , where @xmath14 is the mass of the accelerating particle ) .",
    "for the purpose of these estimates , we use a radio frequency @xmath103 ghz ( @xmath104 ev ) and a cmb frequency corresponding to the peak of the blackbody spectrum , @xmath105 ghz ( @xmath106 ev ) , where @xmath51 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath107 the planck constant , and @xmath108 k is the cmb temperature .",
    "consequently , the energy losses due to inverse compton may be calculated in the thomson limit .",
    "compare this with the situation for high energy electrons , for which the thomson condition would not be satisfied even at energies @xmath109 ev , requiring in that case the full klein - nishina treatment .",
    "the propagation of high - energy particles is here modeled in a region of tens of kpc size .",
    "therefore we neglect any effect of the relativistically - narrowed jet on the spatial distribution of the radio background , assumed for simplicity to be isotropic .",
    "since the cmb intensity field is also isotropic , we take these energy losses into account using the following angle - integrated power - loss rate : @xmath110 where @xmath111 @xmath112 is the thomson cross section for a generic particle of mass @xmath14 , which can be a proton or heavy ion , and @xmath113 is the total energy density of the magnetic field . the photon energy density @xmath114 inside a typical radio lobe is computed as @xmath115 , where we assume @xmath116 to be a standard luminosity density corresponding to the fanaroff - riley class ii of galaxies ( @xmath117 w hz@xmath118 sr@xmath118 at @xmath119 mhz ) , and @xmath13 is the size of the spherical acceleration zone . for the cmb , we use @xmath120 erg @xmath67 . in a region",
    "where magnetic turbulence is absent or static , a given test particle propagates by  bouncing \" randomly off the inhomogeneities in @xmath121 , but its energy remains constant .",
    "the field we will model below , however , is comprised of time - varying gyroresonant turbulent waves ( see equation [ omega ] ) , and collisions between the test particle and these waves produces a net acceleration ( in the lab frame ) .    , which remains constant during the propagation .",
    "the energy is verified to be constant , as expected , over a time interval @xmath122 , within a relative error of @xmath123 .",

    "the particle is released with a fixed initial speed @xmath81 , but pointed in a randomly chosen direction .",
    "the calculation stops when the particle leaves the radio lobe and is injected into the intergalactic medium.,width=340 ]",
    "in this section we describe the numerical code used to perform the simulations .",
    "the lorentz equation ( [ lorentz ] ) is integrated using a runge - kutta @xmath127 order method ( press et al .",
    "1997 ) for the system of 6 first - order differential equations @xmath128_i}{\\gamma}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath129 . the components @xmath130 and @xmath131 are intended to be the real parts of the corresponding complex quantities .    the portable random number generator used to produce the turbulence is knuth s subtractive routine _ ran3 _ ( press et al .",
    "1997 ) , with a seed number @xmath132 .",
    "this routine has a relatively short execution time and is suitable to avoid the introduction of unwanted correlations into the numerical computation .",
    "there are two approaches to numerically implementing a turbulent magnetic field generated by this method .",
    "the first approach ( used in giacalone & jokipii 1994 ) is to calculate the magnetic field at every time step for each particle position .",
    "the position is then found by solving the lorentz equation ( [ lorentz ] ) . in the second approach , the magnetic field",
    "is generated for a given volume at the beginning of the simulation and then it evolves according to equation ( [ omega ] ) . in order to have an acceptable @xmath51-binning with a dynamical range of @xmath133 , one would then need to specify the field at an excessively large number of lattice points .",
    "this is not only time - consuming , but also very memory - intensive .",
    "so , like giacalone & jokipii ( 1994 ) , we adopt the former approach . in this way , the magnetic field is generated only where needed , and the overwhelming amount of computer memory required by the second approach is not necessary , .",
    "since the confinement volume is a parameter of the model , the second approach would also require adapting the lattice spacing in order to maintain the same space resolution in physical space .",
    "the runge - kutta integrator has previously been validated for the cases of uniform and constant electric and magnetic fields , where the outcome of the simulation can be compared with an analytical solution .",
    "secondly , as a validation test of the code , we reproduced the result of giacalone & jokipii ( 1994 ) for the case of a 3d magnetostatic turbulence , by using the same set of parameters .",
    "we discretize the turbulence in 50 transverse modes @xmath51 , where the values of @xmath51 are chosen to be evenly spaced in logarithmic scale in the interval of the corresponding length scales from @xmath134 to @xmath135 , where @xmath81 is the initial velocity of the particle and @xmath82 is its gyrofrequency in the background magnetic field .",
    "the particles are released in a random initial position with initial velocity randomly oriented but with fixed value @xmath81 . in figure",
    "[ gj ] , we present the trajectory of a single particle , the position along the three axes expressed in units of the gyration radius . in this test , the energy of the particle is constant within a relative error of @xmath123 over a time interval corresponding to @xmath136 .    in order to produce the time - dependent turbulent magnetic field considered in this paper , between two successive shufflings of all five random quantities in @xmath137 , which are performed every @xmath138s ,",
    "the particle propagates gyroresonantly with the oscillating turbulence .",
    "we verified that a change in the runge - kutta time - binning by over one order of magnitude does not produce any systematic numerical effects associated with @xmath139 and the spectrum . changing the @xmath51-binning from @xmath140 to @xmath141 in equation [ omega ]",
    "similarly does not noticeably change the resultant @xmath139 and the spectrum .",
    "we chose @xmath142 which results in a reasonably long computational time .",
    "however , a coarser @xmath51-binning , e.g. , with @xmath143 modes / decade , could possibly result in a worse determination of the macroscopic indicator as instantaneous spatial diffusion coefficients ; the time evolution of the diffusion coefficients is however beyond the scope of the present paper .     for a proton propagating through a time - varying turbulent magnetic field .",

    "in addition , we remark that the acceleration mechanism we have invoked here is sustained over 10 orders of magnitude in particle energy , beginning at @xmath166 ; the uhecrs therefore emerge naturally from the physical conditions thought to be prevalent within the giant radio lobes of agns , without the introduction of any additional exotic physics ( for a complete review of the bottom - up models , see bhattacharjee & sigl 2000 and other references cited therein ) .    to provide the possibility of observationally testing the model we have presented here , we show in figure [ el_loss ] the temporal evolution of the energy loss rate to first order in @xmath167 ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) for a single electron propagating through the same magnetic turbulence we have used to accelerate the protons and heavier ions . by estimating the flux of uhe protons @xmath168 escaping from one giant radio lobe , under the assumption of neutrality in the source , we can estimate the flux of accelerated electrons @xmath169 . in principle , it is therefore possible to estimate the expected radio luminosity from these regions due to this particular acceleration process .",

    "thus , although source - density evolution may alter our results somewhat , our conclusions will probably not be greatly affected . in a more conservative interpretation ,",
    "the result presented here provides the injection spectrum from a single source .",
    "second , we have not included the gzk effect for particle energies above 50 eev .",
    "this omission becomes progressively more important as the energy approaches @xmath1 ev .",
    "these refinements , in addition to a more detailed analysis of the composition of primary uhecrs , will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "any discussion concerning the evolution of the instantaneous spatial diffusion coefficients parallel to and perpendicular to the background magnetic field , and on the transition to a diffusive regime , will also be reserved to a future publication .    in our approach ,",
    "we have also neglected the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the turbulent field which might increase the ratio @xmath171 , and bring about a possible local failure of the assumption of isotropy of the turbulence .",
    "we remark that the mechanism of stochastic acceleration presented here may be functioning even for a population of particles , protons or heavy nuclei , pre - accelerated to an initial energy @xmath172 ev , e.g. , by multi - shock fronts propagating at super - alfvnic velocity",
    ". the corresponding gyroresonant wavenumber range in this case will decrease down to @xmath173 .",
    "we have shown that a region containing a kolmogorov ( turbulent ) distribution of non - relativistic alfvn waves can accelerate particles to ultra - high energies .",
    "the physical parameters in these regions are compatible with those believed to be operating in the radio lobes of agns .",
    "we have discussed the predicted differential spectrum within the parameter space of the model , characterized by the size @xmath13 of the acceleration region and the turbulent magnetic energy .",
    "possible tests of this model involve the synchrotron or ic emission by a population of similarly accelerated electrons .    as the auger observatory continues to gather more data , improving on the statistics",
    ", our uhecr source identification will continue to get better .",
    "eventually , we should be able to tell how significant the gzk effect really is , and whether the cutoff in the cr distribution is indeed due to propagation effects , or whether it is primarily the result of limitations in the acceleration itself .",
    "given the fact that energies as high as @xmath2 ev may be reached within typical radio lobes , it is possible that both of these factors must be considered in future refinements of this work .",
