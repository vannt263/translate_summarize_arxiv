    "the atmospheres of cool stars are governed by their magnetic fields .",
    "phenomena ranging from flares to coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) to stellar winds are all intimately related to the atmospheric magnetic field .",
    "the best case study we have for a stellar magnetic field is the sun .",
    "the solar magnetic field has been studied in detail over many scales and cycles .",
    "we can not , however , observe the atmospheric ( coronal ) magnetic field directly and so must rely upon theoretical models . as input to these models , information about the magnetic field at the sun s surface ( photosphere ) can be determined through the zeeman effect @xcite .",
    "maps of the line - of - sight magnetic field ( magnetograms ) have been available for many years .",
    "more recently , vector magnetograms of the sun have also been incorporated into coronal models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on stars other than the sun",
    ", we now have insight into magnetic field structures .",
    "we can use zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi ) to determine stellar magnetograms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such magnetograms convey only the large - scale structure of a star s magnetic field .",
    "fields on the active region scale and smaller are not observable currently .",
    "much important information about the stellar enviroment , however , can be gained from a knowledge of the large - scale structure of the global magnetic field .",
    "two approaches have been used mainly to study the magnetic coronae of stars ( henceforth ` stars ' refers to stars other than the sun ) .",
    "the first is a potential field extrapolation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the potential field approach is useful as it gives a unique solution that minimizes the magnetic energy for a given set of boundary conditions .",
    "however , as there is no current ( @xmath1 ) in a potential field , the magnetic field in the corona does not contain twist , which is considered important for the onset of different forms of eruptive behaviour ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , the lorentz force completely decouples from the non - magnetic terms in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) momentum equation .",
    "this decoupling means that certain assumptions need to be made when finding proxies for quantities such as x - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second approach is to perform a full mhd simulation of the global corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it is possible to capture the large - scale dynamics of the corona .",
    "however , this approach is computationally very expensive and often requires super - computing resources .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a technique that can be thought of as an intermediary step between the potential field model and full mhd simulations , as mentioned above .",
    "we present a magnetohydrostatic ( mhs ) solution which couples the coronal density , pressure and magnetic field together .",
    "perturbations in the hydrostatic density and pressure , due to the magnetic field , can be calculated self - consistently .",
    "as the solution is static , like the potential field model , it is very simple to implement .",
    "the model allows us to calculate , with relative ease , a twisted stellar coronal field where magnetic forces balance hydrostatic forces .",
    "the approach presented in this paper has been applied to the solar corona where large - scale features have been captured successfully @xcite",
    ". our approach will be particularly suited to stellar applications , where magnetograms only convey the large - scale structure of the magnetic field .",
    "this type of model can capture the large - scale field structure ( as evidenced by the solar applications mentioned above ) and improve upon the potential field extrapolations with the inclusion of current density and the coupling of the magnetic field to the background stellar atmosphere .    in the following section we give a detailed derivation of the coronal magnetic field and the associated density and pressure perturbations ( correcting typographical errors that appear in previous works ) .",
    "we follow this section with an analysis of how the resulting free parameters affect the geometry and topology of the model coronal magnetic field . after the analysis , an application of the model",
    "is given where a magnetic map of the m - dwarf gj  182 , published by @xcite , is used as input .",
    "the paper ends with a summary .",
    "the mhs equations that describe the balance between the lorentz and hydrostatic forces can be written as @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the magnetic induction ( referred to as the magnetic field ) , @xmath6 is the curent density , @xmath7 is the plasma presure , @xmath8 is the plasma density and @xmath9 is gravity .",
    "a discussion of appropriate boundary conditions will be left until later . rather than proceeding with equations ( [ momentum ] ) to ( [ divb ] ) in dimensional form",
    ", we write them in dimensionless form by introducing the variables @xmath10 the distance vector is labelled @xmath11 in anticipation of the use of spherical coordinates for stellar applications .",
    "dropping the asterisks , the dimensionless mhs equations are @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 all further expressions will be in dimensionless form unless stated otherwise .",
    "here we have written gravity in terms of its potential @xmath15 , viz .",
    "@xmath16 to make progress , we model the current density as the composition of two distinct terms : @xmath17 this choice of the current density enables us to model the magnetic field through a range of plasma @xmath18 . since equation ( [ current ] ) is linear , we can make analytical progress and take a practical intermediate step between potential field extrapolations and expensive global mhd simulations .",
    "@xmath19 is a constant parameter and the first term on the rhs of equation ( [ current ] ) represents the current density of a linear force - free field . the second term on the rhs represents the current density that produces a lorentz force that can balance the effects of the pressure gradient and gravity .",
    "@xmath20 is a free function which will be specified shortly .",
    "the approach of using this type of term was introduced by @xcite and has been used in several subsequent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also present a non - potential magnetic field model , in the stellar physics context , with a term similar to the second term on the rhs of equation ( [ current ] ) .",
    "however , they do not consider mhs equilibria .",
    "the combination of the two terms in equation ( [ current ] ) results in components of current density that are both parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the total field - aligned current density , if written in the form @xmath21 , has a non - uniform @xmath22 .",
    "although the field in our model can be ( depending on the choice of parameters discussed below ) more complicated than a linear force - free field , our model has the advantage of taking the same input from magnetograms as linear force - free models . as potential field models are a particular case of linear force - free models @xmath23 , potential models can be updated to the mhs model easily .",
    "the following derivation of the model is based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an alternative method exploiting the toroidal and poloidal components of the field can also be used @xcite .",
    "we shall utilize the toroidal - poloidal approach later when studying the topology of the field .    inserting equation ( [ current ] ) into ampre s law , equation ( [ ampere ] ) , gives , after some manipulation , @xmath24 where @xmath11 is the radial vector .",

    "this analogy gives us a starting point for what form @xmath26 can take in order to yield analytical solutions .",
    "several possible analytical solutions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a free parameter .",

    "the density and pressure perturbations at the stellar surface are also displayed and are proportional to @xmath143 so that shapes on the countour plots can be matched to corresponding ones on the magnetogram .",
    "the model presented in this paper is suitable for determining the large - scale features of a star s corona .",
    "the model also has the advantage of being simple , fast to implement and , unlike full mhd models , is not computationally expensive to implement .",
    "the effort involved is only slightly more than a potential field model ( which is a special case of the mhs model ) . by a suitable choice of @xmath26 and the free parameters @xmath19 and @xmath39",
    ", one can investigate stellar coronae with different geometries , topologies , pressure and density distributions and current density profiles .",
    "in future work , we will apply our model to stellar observations and attempt to constrain the free parameters using the information provided by the observations , such as the toroidal component of the magnetic field .",
