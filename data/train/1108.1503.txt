    "the problem of formulating supersymmetric theories on lattices has a long history going back to the earliest days of lattice gauge theory .",
    "however , after initial efforts failed to produce useful supersymmetric lattice actions the topic languished for many years . indeed a folklore developed that supersymmetry and the lattice were mutually incompatible . however , recently , the problem has been re - examined using new tools and ideas such as topological twisting @xcite , orbifold projection and deconstruction @xcite , and a class of lattice models have been constructed which maintain one or more supersymmetries exactly at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "the availability of a supersymmetric lattice construction is clearly very exciting .",
    "for example , having a lattice construction of the well known @xmath2 sym in four - dimensions is very advantageous from the point of view of exploring the connection between gauge theories and string / gravitational theories .",
    "but even without this connection to string theory , it is clearly of great importance to be able to give a non - perturbative formulation of a supersymmetric theory via a lattice path integral , in the same way that one can formally define qcd as a limit of lattice qcd as the lattice spacing goes to zero and the box size to infinity . from a practical point of view , one can also hope that some of the technology of lattice field theory such as strong coupling expansions and monte carlo simulation can be brought to bear on such supersymmetric theories .    in this paper",
    ", we will briefly describe the key ingredients that go into the lattice constructions of a variety of sym theories and then provide the details of c++ code that can be used to simulate these theories . in section [ sec : method - twist - sym ] we provide the general method of twisting the supersymmetries of certain classes of sym theories to provide twisted sym theories that are compatible with discretization on the lattice .",
    "we start with the twisted @xmath3 sym in two dimensions as a warm up example and after writing down the discretization of this theory we go on to describe the twisted versions of @xmath2 sym in three dimensions and @xmath2 sym in four dimensions . in section",
    "[ sec : simulating - sym - alg ] we describe the algorithms used to simulate these resultant lattice theories : rational hybrid monte carlo ( rhmc ) algorithm to compute the fermion determinant with fractional power , leapfrog algorithm to evolve the system of equations and then a metropolis test to accept or reject the configurations . in section [ sec : overall - structure ] we provide the overall structure of the c++ code and describe how the code advances by generating new configurations using rhmc algorithm , saves the field configurations after some number of monte carlo sweeps and measures the observables in the theory .",
    "we provide some simulation results in section [ sec : sim - results ] , specific to the @xmath3 sym in two - dimensions .",
    "we compute the eigenvalues of the scalars of the theory , study the pfaffian phases and the presence of fermionic sign problem in the theory and also investigate the restoration of supersymmetry by checking if the scalar supersymmetry has indeed been implemented correctly in our c++ code .",
    "we provide some conclusions and outlook in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "we also provide three appendices : [ sec : install ] details the installation of the program , [ sec : file - list ] lists the files included in susy_lattice library with a brief description of their purpose and in [ sec : input - param ] we provide a sample file with input parameters .",
    "we hope that this work will motivate elementary particle physicists as well as high energy computational physicists to pursue numerical studies of supersymmetric lattice theories in particular , the @xmath2 yang  mills in four dimensions .",
    "first , let us explain why discretization of supersymmetric theories resisted solution for so long .",
    "the central problem is that naive discretizations of continuum supersymmetric theories break supersymmetry completely and radiative effects lead to a profusion of relevant supersymmetry breaking counterterms in the renormalized lattice action .",
    "the coefficients to these counterterms must then be carefully fine tuned as the lattice spacing is sent to zero in order to arrive at a supersymmetric theory in the continuum limit . in most cases this is both unnatural and practically impossible  particularly if the theory contains scalar fields .",
    "of course , one might have expected problems  the supersymmetry algebra is an extension of the poincar algebra , which is explicitly broken on the lattice . specifically , there are no infinitesimal translation generators on a discrete space - time so that the algebra @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the space - time index , is already broken at the classical level . equivalently , it is a straightforward exercise to show that a naive supersymmetry variation of a naively discretized supersymmetric theory fails to yield zero as a consequence of the failure of the leibniz rule when applied to lattice difference operators . in the last five years or",
    "so this problem has been revisited using new theoretical tools and ideas and a set of lattice models have been constructed which retain exactly some of the continuum supersymmetry at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "the basic idea is to maintain a particular sub - algebra of the full supersymmetry algebra in the lattice theory .",
    "the hope is that this exact symmetry will constrain the effective lattice action and protect the theory from dangerous supersymmetry violating counterterms .",
    "two approaches have been pursued to produce such supersymmetric actions : one based on ideas drawn from the field of topological field theory @xcite and another pioneered by david b. kaplan .",
    "mithat nsal and collaborators using ideas of orbifolding and deconstruction @xcite . remarkably , these two seemingly independent approaches lead to the same lattice theories  see @xcite and the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "this convergence of two seemingly completely different approaches to the problem leads one to suspect that the final lattice theories may represent essentially unique solutions to the simultaneous requirements of locality , gauge - invariance and at least one exact supersymmetry . in this paper",
    ", we will use the language of topological twisting to discuss these supersymmetric lattice constructions , but the reader should remember that the orbifold methods lead to the same lattice theories .      the basic idea of twisting goes back to witten in his seminal paper on topological field theory @xcite but actually had been anticipated in earlier work on staggered fermions @xcite . in our context the idea is decompose the fields of the theory in terms of representations not of the original ( euclidean ) rotational symmetry @xmath7 but a twisted rotational symmetry @xmath8 , which is the diagonal subgroup of this symmetry and an @xmath9 subgroup of the r - symmetry of the theory , so(d)^=diag(so_lorentz(d)so_r(d ) )  . to be explicit , consider the case where the total number of supersymmetries is @xmath10 . in this case",
    "we can treat the supercharges of the twisted theory as a @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 .",
    "this matrix can be expanded on products of gamma matrices : q = qi + q_a _ a + q_ab_a_b +  the @xmath13 antisymmetric tensor components that arise in this basis are the twisted supercharges and satisfy a corresponding supersymmetry algebra following from the original algebra q^2 & = & 0  , + \\{q , q_a } & = & p_a  , + & & the presence of the nilpotent scalar supercharge @xmath14 is most important : it is the algebra of this charge that we can hope to translate to the lattice .",
    "the second piece of the algebra expresses the fact that the momentum is the @xmath14-variation of something , which makes plausible the statement that the energy - momentum tensor and hence the entire action can be written in @xmath14-exact form there is an additional @xmath14-closed term needed . ] .",
    "notice that an action written in such a @xmath14-exact form is trivially invariant under the scalar supersymmetry , provided the latter remains nilpotent under discretization .",
    "the rewriting of the supercharges in terms of twisted variables can be repeated for the fermions of the theory and yields a set of antisymmetric tensors @xmath15 , which for the case of @xmath10 matches the number of components of a real khler - dirac field .",
    "this repackaging of the fermions of the theory into a khler - dirac field is at the heart of how the discrete theory avoids fermion doubling as was shown by becher , joos and rabin in the early days of lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "it is important to recognize that the transformation to twisted variables corresponds to a simple change of variables in flat space ",
    "one more suitable to discretization .",
    "a true topological field theory only results when the scalar charge is treated as a true brst charge and attention is restricted to states annihilated by this charge . in the language of the supersymmetric parent theory such a restriction corresponds to a projection to the vacua of the theory .",
    "it is _ not _ employed in the lattice constructions we discuss in this paper .",
    "we look at the twisted @xmath3 sym in two dimensions as a warm up example .",
    "this theory satisfies our requirements for supersymmetric latticization : its r - symmetry possesses an @xmath16 subgroup corresponding to rotations of the two degenerate majorana fermions into each other .",
    "explicitly the theory can be written in twisted form as s = qd^2x ( _ ab f_ab + - d )  .",
    "[ 2daction ] the degrees of freedom are just the twisted fermions @xmath17 previously described and a complex gauge field @xmath18 . the latter is built from the usual gauge field and the two scalars present in the untwisted theory @xmath19 with corresponding complexified field strength @xmath20 .",
    "the complex covariant derivatives appearing in these expressions are defined by d_a & = & _ a + a_a = _ a + a_a + ib_a  , + _ a & = & _ a + _ a = _ a + a_a- i b_a  .",

    "this structure makes possible the appearance of a complex gauge field in the twisted theory .",
    "the nilpotent transformations associated with @xmath14 are given explicitly by q a_a & = & _ a + q _ a & = & 0 + q _ a & = & 0 + q _ ab & = & -_ab + q & = & d + q d&=&0    performing the @xmath14-variation and integrating out the auxiliary field @xmath6 yields s = d^2x ( -_abf_ab + [ _ a , d_a]^2 - _ abd _ - _ a_a )  .

    "it is now clear that the imaginary parts of the gauge fields @xmath23 can now be given an interpretation as the scalar fields of the usual formulation .",
    "similarly one can build spinors out of the twisted fermions and write the action in the manifestly dirac form l_f = (    cc_12 &    ) (    cc - d_2-ib_2&d_1+ib_1 + d_1-ib_1&d_2-ib_2    ) (    c_1 + _ 2    )  .",
