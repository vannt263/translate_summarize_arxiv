    "it has been known for over thirty years that luminous , hot stars have powerful stellar winds ( morton 1967 ) .",
    "these winds are important in a variety of astrophysical contexts , most notably because of their dynamical influence on the interstellar medium , their effect on stellar evolution and their role in metal enrichment of galaxies .",
    "the proposal that these winds are driven by radiation pressure , in particular by photon scattering in spectral lines , was developed by lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) and is now generally accepted ( kudritzki & puls 2000 ) . since the identification of the mass - loss mechanism , attention has been concentrated on the development of techniques which can predict reliable mass - loss rates .",
    "currently , the most accurate mass - loss rates for hot stars are obtained from monte carlo simulations of radiation transport in winds ( de koter , heap & hubeny 1997 ; vink , de koter & lamers 1999 , 2000 ; hereafter vdkl99 , vdkl00 respectively ) , an approach to mass - loss calculations first applied by abbott & lucy ( 1985 , hereafter al85 ) . in this method ,",
    "the global constraint of energy conservation is used to determine the mass - loss rate algebraically while the wind terminal velocity is fixed at the observed value .",
    "this is in contrast to other techniques , such as ` cak ' theory ( castor , abbott & klein 1975 ) , where the mass - loss rate is an eigenvalue determined at a critical point and the terminal velocity is calculated .",
    "monte carlo simulations have also been used to study mass - loss as a function of metallicity ( vink , de koter & lamers 2001 ) and mass - loss from luminous blue variables ( vink & de koter 2002 ) .",
    "a weakness of previous determinations of mass - loss rates from monte carlo simulations is the assumption that all line scattering events may be treated as resonance scatterings .",
    "this assumption was made by al85 and has been followed by others in subsequent work ( including the mass - loss calculations of de koter et al .",
    "1997 and vdkl99,00 ) .",
    "it has the advantage of significantly simplifying the computation and can be justified for many of the strong lines , even some non - resonance lines , in several important ions ( see al85 ) .",
    "however , although remarkably successful for computing mass - loss rates , the assumption is not valid in general : lucy ( 1999b ) included downwards branching in a monte carlo spectral synthesis code for supernovae and found this to have a significant impact on the emergent spectrum .    following recent developments of the monte carlo energy - packet technique ( lucy 2002 , 2003 ) ,",
    "it has become feasible to lift the resonance scattering assumption and allow branching to occur in line scattering events .",
    "branching may effect mass - loss rates since it allows photon leakage from one part of the spectrum to another ( see e.g. the discussion by owocki & gayley 1999 ) .",
    "if only resonance scattering is permitted , the frequency of a given photon packet is gradually redshifted in the frame co - moving with the stellar wind ( which accelerates outwards in the star s reference frame ) : photons have no opportunity to jump in frequency .",
    "branching alters this by allowing photons to be re - emitted in a different part of the spectrum following a line scattering event .",
    "the net effect of line branching on many photons is to preferentially redistribute photons from regions of the spectrum with many strong spectral lines ( e.g. ultraviolet ) to relatively sparse regions ( e.g. infrared ) .",
    "this will reduce the net line force since photons undergo fewer line scatterings .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to quantify this effect and determine the extent by which the assumption of resonance scattering causes mass - loss rates to be overestimated .",
    "it is to be expected that the magnitude of the effect will depend on the typical number of scatterings that photons undergo as they traverse the wind : in the limit where no photons are scattered more than once ( single scattering limit ) the frequency of re - emission is irrelevant to the mass - loss calculation meaning that line branching can have no effect .",
    "most of the results presented in this paper relate to ob stars , the stars for which vdkl00 have computed mass - loss rates .",
    "however , calculations appropriate for wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars are also presented .",
    "the winds of w - r stars present the greatest challenges to the theory of radiation driven mass - loss , requiring significantly higher efficiency in the transfer of momentum from the radiation field to the matter than ob star winds .",
    "lucy & abbott ( 1993 , hereafter la93 ) investigated line driving in w - r stars and concluded that it was possible to obtain wind performance numbers @xmath3 which are significantly in excess of one , as required for w - r winds ( @xmath4 is the mass - loss rate , @xmath5 is the terminal velocity of the wind and @xmath6 is the luminosity of the wind - free star ) .",
    "de koter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) performed monte carlo simulations with relatively sophisticated models for specific wn5h and of / wn stars ( as classified by crowther & dessart 1998 ) to compute line - driven mass - loss rates for comparison with values determined from h@xmath7 observations .",
    "they found that the computed mass - loss rates were too small by factors @xmath8 ( note , however , that there are significant uncertainties in the mass - loss rates determined from observations ) .",
    "a complete understanding of the mass - loss mechanism in w - r stars does not yet exist , but it seems certain that line and continuum driving have some role ( see e.g. nugis & lamers 2002 ; lamers & nugis 2002 ) .",
    "this investigation is of particular relevance to w - r stars because the high density and ionisation stratification of w - r winds means that multiple scattering is much more prevalent than in ob stars . since the effect of line branching on the radiative acceleration can only be important when multiple scattering occurs , w - r stars should exhibit the most extreme effects .",
    "subsequent to the commencement of the work presented here , onifer & gayley ( 2003 ) have published a complementary study of frequency redistribution in stellar winds .",
    "they present a parameterised analytical theory appropriate for an idealised spectrum consisting of two frequency domains , one line - rich and the other line - poor .",
    "however , they did not perform any calculations with a real line list meaning they were unable to obtain quantitative estimates of the effect of frequency redistribution on mass - loss rates .",
    "in contrast , the numerical computations that are presented here do not require any idealisations of the distribution of line opacity across the spectrum and use a real line list , allowing quantitative results to be derived .",
    "study of line branching is also relevant for predictions of ionising fluxes from hot stars .",
    "calculations which neglect line branching , for example _ costar _ models ( leitherer et al .",
    "1996 , schaerer & de koter 1997 ) , may overestimate the ionising flux as a result ( crowther et al .",
    "the new monte carlo techniques employed here ( lucy 2002,2003 ) will readily allow this effect to be quantified in the near future .    in section 2 ,",
    "the stellar wind models that will be used for the mass - loss calculations are discussed .",
    "the monte carlo approach used for computing mass - loss rates is described in section 3 , and section 4 introduces the atomic data used in the calculations .",
    "the results for models of ob stars are presented in section 5 and for a w - r star model in section 6 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 7 .",
    "as discussed above the objective of this paper is a _ differential _",
    "study of the effects of line branching and not the development of high quality stellar wind models .",
    "therefore , simple `` core - halo '' models are adopted for the sake of tractability .",
    "they have been constructed following al85 and la93 .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity law    @xmath9    is adopted where @xmath10 is the core radius ( the base of the wind ) and @xmath11 is the wind velocity at @xmath10 .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 and @xmath13 are given in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "the mass density @xmath14 is determined from the equation of mass conservation    @xmath15      the approach to ionisation and excitation recommended by lucy ( 2003 ) is adopted here .",
    "namely , only approximate non - lte solutions are pursued and analytic formulae are used for both ionisation and excitation .",
    "this approach has been used in many previous studies ( including al85 and , in part , vdkl99,00 ) and is particularly suitable for this study since it decouples the monte carlo simulation of the radiation field from the computation of level populations .",
    "this provides two advantages : first the need for iteration when constructing models is removed and , more importantly , it allows direct study of the effect of line branching on the radiation field in isolation , without any feedback influence on the level populations .    for ionisation",
    ", the modified nebular approximation is adopted    @xmath16 \\sqrt{\\frac{t_e}{t_r } } \\left({\\frac{n_{j+1}n_{e}}{n_{j}}}\\right)^{\\mbox{*}}_{t_{r}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the number density of the @xmath18th ionisation stage , @xmath19 is the free electron number density , @xmath20 is the dilution factor which is defined in terms of the photospheric radius ( @xmath21 ) following la93 , @xmath22 is the fraction of recombinations to ion @xmath18 that go direct to the ground state , @xmath23 is the electron temperature and @xmath24 is the radiation temperature .",
    "the last bracket in equation  ( 3 ) is the ionisation fraction computed using the saha equation at temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the partition functions used for this calculation are non - lte , having been computed using diluted boltzmann population ratios for non - metastable levels ( see below ) .",
    "the @xmath2-values used by al85 have been adopted throughout this paper .",
    "the radiation and electron temperatures used for the calculations are discussed in sections 5 and 6 .    when determining level populations , following al85 and vdkl99 , a distinction is made between metastable levels and those with permitted electric dipole decay routes . for a metastable level @xmath26",
    ", the population relative to the ground state @xmath27 is assumed to be given by the boltzmann formula    @xmath28    while for all other levels it is assumed that the population is driven by radiation such that    @xmath29    equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) allow all level populations to be determined for a given value of @xmath14 .",
    "although approximate , springmann & puls ( 1998 ) have demonstrated that in a typical o star , these formulae provide excellent approximations to ion / level populations obtained from much more detailed non - lte calculations .",
    "the radiation field is simulated by a monte carlo calculation using the macro atom approach developed by lucy ( 2002 ) .",
    "the principles of the method are discussed by lucy ( 2002,2003 ) .",
    "the details of the monte carlo simulation used here are presented below , with particular emphasis on the differences between the calculations discussed by lucy and those performed here .      for the monte carlo calculation",
    ", the wind models ( section 2 ) are discretized into a series of thin spherical shells .",
    "the velocity is allowed to vary in accordance with equation  ( 1 ) throughout the model , but all other parameters are taken to be constant within each shell . to evaluate the density ( @xmath14 ) , for each shell equation ( 2 ) is used for twenty different values of @xmath30 which are equally spaced in @xmath31 between the inner and outer boundaries of the shell . the adopted density for the shell is the @xmath32-weighted mean of these twenty values .",
    "( this weighting is chosen to preserve mass in spherical geometry . )",
    "the dilution factor ( @xmath20 ) is evaluated at the mid - point of each shell .",
    "the innermost shell lies on the surface of the core @xmath33 , the outermost shell extends to @xmath34 .",
    "typically 100 shells of equal thickness in @xmath31 are used in the calculations .",
    "the monte carlo quanta used in the simulation are indivisible packets of radiative energy , termed @xmath30-packets by lucy ( 2002 ) .",
    "the monte carlo method imposes radiative equilibrium by conserving both the number of packets and their co - moving energy throughout the calculation .",
    "thus packets are not created in the domain of the simulation but are only launched into the inner shell ( from the surface of the star ) and propagate until they either re - enter the star through the lower boundary of the innermost shell or emerge from the upper boundary of the outermost shell .    the radiation field incident from the stellar core",
    "is modelled by a black - body spectrum at the temperature of the stellar surface @xmath35 . a lower limit to the wavelength of the incident spectrum",
    "is imposed at @xmath36     on the assumption that higher energy photons are immediately removed via bound - free absorption by he  ii .",
    "the frequencies @xmath37 of the incident @xmath30-packets are equally spaced in @xmath38 , and their energies are assigned according to the planck spectrum .",
    "packets are created with wavelengths up to @xmath39 .",
    "the initial direction cosines @xmath40 are chosen randomly , assuming no limb - darkening .",
    "typically , @xmath41 packets are used in the calculation .",
    "as the packets propagate through the wind they undergo interactions with the material in the wind . immediately after their creation at the lower boundary , after a packet crosses a shell boundary and also after any interaction with wind material , the optical depth that a packet will traverse before its next interaction is chosen at random using @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a random number in the interval 0 to 1 .",
    "contributions to the optical depth along the packet s flight path from both continuous and line opacity are then considered to determine whether the packet undergoes a continuum scattering , a line absorption or whether the packet will cross a boundary into another shell .",
    "the method for selecting which event occurs follows closely that described by lucy ( 2003 ) , sec . 5 , and the reader is referred to that paper for a full explanation .",
    "the subsections that follow briefly explain how the continuum and line contributions to the opacity are computed .",
    "the only continuum process included in the calculations is scattering by free electrons .",
    "although bound - free processes are important in spectral synthesis , they are not the dominant contribution to the radiation driving force in ob stars and are therefore not important in this differential study of line branching .    electron scattering is assumed to be isotropic and coherent in the co - moving frame .",
    "the large velocity gradients in a stellar wind mean that line processes can be treated in the sobolev limit .",
    "lucy ( 2002 ) gives expressions for the sobolev radiative rates and optical depth for the case of an atmosphere in homologous expansion ( his equations 20 , 21 and 22 ) .",
    "however , for the case of non - homologous expansion in a stellar wind , these expressions must be generalised .",
    "the radiative rates for spontaneous emission and absorption in the transition between upper level @xmath26 and lower level @xmath18 are given by the standard expressions    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the usual einstein coefficients , the @xmath47 s are level populations ( number densities ) and @xmath48 is the integrated mean intensity in the line . the escape probability , @xmath49 is given by ( klein & castor 1978 )    @xmath50    and the sobolev optical depth @xmath51 is    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the line frequency and    @xmath54\\ ] ]    is the rate of change of co - moving frequency with path - length for a photon with rest frame frequency @xmath55 at radius @xmath30 travelling in the direction specified by @xmath40 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath57 does not significantly complicate the monte carlo calculation since @xmath57 may be taken as constant along any given photon trajectory within a shell , provided that the shells are sufficiently thin .    in this formulation ,",
    "the interaction between a packet and a spectral line with which is comes into resonance is described by a single scattering event . in reality , when a photon enters resonance with a line it may scatter many times in that line before it is redshifted out of the region in which interaction occurs ( the _ resonance zone _ ) . since thermalisation",
    "is not included here , these multiple interactions with a particular line are readily described by a single scattering event and the usual sobolev escape probability ( see de koter et al .",
    "1997 for a discussion of thermalisation during multiple interactions within a resonance zone ) . accordingly",
    ", throughout this paper the term _ single scattering _ is used to refer to photon packets that interact with _ one line _ during the monte carlo simulation , even though this interaction may physically consist of several scatterings .",
    "_ multiple scattering _ refers to energy packets that undergo two or more independent interactions with _ different _ spectral lines during their flight through the model .",
    "the sobolev optical depth of a line is used to determine whether or not a packet is absorbed when it comes into resonance with the line .",
    "if absorption occurs the macro atom method developed by lucy ( 2002 ) is used to determine the atomic level from which re - emission occurs and a random number is used to determine in which of the transitions from the level the packet is emitted , following lucy ( 2003 ) .",
    "the macro atom formalism does allow for collisional , bound - free and free - free processes but , for simplicity , these are not included here .",
    "the calculation of the macro atom upward jumping probabilities requires @xmath58 to be known for each spectral line .",
    "lucy ( 1999b,2003 ) has shown how efficient monte carlo estimators may be constructed for integrals of the radiation field . following lucy , the estimator used here for a transition between upper level @xmath26 and lower level @xmath18 in a particular shell @xmath59",
    "is    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the time interval represented by the monte carlo simulation and @xmath62 is the volume of the shell @xmath59 .",
    "the sum runs over all packets which come into resonance with the line in shell @xmath59 during the simulation .",
    "@xmath63 is the packet energy in the co - moving frame and @xmath56 is the sobolev optical depth of the transition .",
    "note that since @xmath56 is angle dependent every packet encounters a different optical depth : thus the factors involving @xmath56 must be placed inside the summation . for the branching calculations presented in the later sections of this paper , the @xmath48-values are calculated iteratively for each model , with initial values taken as a dilute black - body radiation field .",
    "the values of @xmath48 were found to converge to sufficient accuracy for the mass - loss calculations within only one or two iterations .",
    "for all the models discussed in this paper , in addition to finding mass - loss rates when branching is permitted , calculations have been performed in which the macro atom formalism has not been employed , and all lines have been treated as resonance lines ( no line branching ) . the comparison of results using the full macro atom approach and the resonance scattering assumption forms the basis of the differential analyses presented in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "once the emission frequency of the packet is determined , the new direction of propagation is determined by randomly sampling the distribution function for the escape probability .",
    "thus the probability of emission with direction cosine @xmath40 is    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a normalisation constant .      once all the packets have propagated through the model and",
    "have either escaped from the upper boundary or re - entered the stellar core , the rate of energy deposition in the wind can be computed .",
    "it is given by al85",
    "@xmath66    where the @xmath63 s are the rest frame packet energies and the sums run over all packets as they enter the calculation ( index @xmath67 ) , escape the wind ( index @xmath26 ) and re - enter the star ( index @xmath18 ) .",
    "this energy goes into lifting material out of the gravitational field of the star and so the mass - loss rate implied by the monte carlo calculation is given by ( la93 )    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the escape speed at @xmath70 .",
    "this can be compared to the mass - loss rate assumed in the modelling ( @xmath4 ) . by performing calculations for models with different values of @xmath4",
    ", @xmath71 can be found as a function of @xmath4 and so the self - consistent value of @xmath4 ( i.e. when @xmath72 ) can be identified .",
    "this approach does not look for local dynamical consistency between the driving force and the velocity law : the mass - loss rate is determined algebraically from the global requirement @xmath72 rather than as an eigenvalue at a critical point in the flow .",
    "la93 used this method and showed that , for their w - r model , the monte carlo radiative line acceleration differed locally from that implied by the assumed velocity law by up to 0.29  dex .",
    "ultimately models with realistic calculations of the line acceleration which impose local dynamic consistency are desirable but , as discussed by la93 , in view of the other simplifications made , to pursue local consistency here is not warranted .",
    "atomic models and radiative transition probabilities are needed for the computation of the mass - loss as described above . for the calculations presented here ,",
    "the atomic data has all been taken from the kurucz & bell ( 1995 ) atomic database .",
    "all elements with solar abundances @xmath73 have been neglected . for the elements which are included all ionisation stages up to vi that are in the database",
    "are used ( higher ionisation species are not important for the ob - star models below ) . the elements and ionisation stages from which lines have been included in the calculations presented in section  5 are listed in table  1 .",
    ".the elements and ions included in the line list . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath74 this value was read from fig 2 . of vdkl00 since the mass - loss recipe ( section 5 of vdkl00 ) does not fit this model well .    from observations of h@xmath7 , puls et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have derived a mass - loss rate of @xmath75  m@xmath76  yr@xmath77 for @xmath2  puppis .",
    "this value is indicated by the vertical line in fig .  1 , and is in good agreement with the computed mass - loss rates discussed above .",
    "however , there is significant uncertainty in the observational mass - loss rate : estimates from radio fluxes give only @xmath78  m@xmath76  yr@xmath77 ( lamers & leitherer 1993 ) .",
    "clumping in the wind may affect the accuracy of these determinations although this effect should be small for ob stars ( kudritzki & puls 2000 ) .",
    "in view of the large observational uncertainty in the mass - loss rate , the effect of line branching can be regarded as small and , for the present , is not important for modelling mass - loss from @xmath2  puppis to observable accuracy .",
    "however , the effect is not utterly negligible and upon a reduction in the observational uncertainty by a factor of a few , it should become detectable ( note , however , that since stellar winds show intrinsic variability at the level of several tens per cent , time variability would also need to be taken into account in reliable modelling of mass - loss rates to such high accuracy ) .",
    "following on from the detailed discussion of @xmath2  puppis above , in this section the effects of line branching on the computed mass - loss rates are investigated for a range of ob - star models spanning roughly the same parameter space as the vdkl00 calculations . for each model ( defined by the stellar parameters @xmath6,@xmath79,@xmath80 and @xmath5 ) , two @xmath81 curves have been computed , one with line branching included and one without .",
    "the models considered are listed in table  3 and the @xmath81 curves are shown for each model in fig .  4 . for each model ,",
    "the globally self - consistent ( @xmath82 ) mass - loss rate was found both with and without line branching included ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively ) .",
    "these are given in table  3 .",
    "the monte carlo errors in the mass - loss rates are less than 2 per cent .",
    "the table also gives the wind performance number ( @xmath85 ) calculated with and without line branching , the vdkl00 mass - loss rate ( @xmath86 ) for comparison , the ratio of the branching to resonance - only mass - loss rates and the characteristic density of the model @xmath87 .",
    "the models are labelled a  o , being ordered first by decreasing effective temperature and secondly by decreasing @xmath88 .",
    "consider first the high temperature models appropriate for o stars ( a  h ) .",
    "for these models the @xmath81 curves ( fig .",
    "4 ) are all approximately straight in @xmath89-@xmath89 space around @xmath72 .",
    "the effect of line branching ( i.e. the vertical offset between the two curves in fig .",
    "4 ) is relatively small for all these models  it leads to a reduction in the self - consistent mass - loss rate by between three and 25 per cent , relative to calculations which neglect branching . at a given temperature ( e.g. compare models c  f )",
    "the reduction is closely correlated with the characteristic density ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "this is expected since the effect of line branching is related to multiple scattering which is more common at high densities .",
    "n all have @xmath90  k ( early b stars ) .",
    "the first four of these models ( i  l ) have terminal velocities which are typical for stars cooler than the bi - stability jump ( @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the effective escape velocity : see vdkl99,00 ) while the other two have higher terminal velocities , characteristic of stars hotter than the jump ( @xmath93 ) . for these models ,",
    "the @xmath81 curves around @xmath72 are more complex than for the higher temperature models discussed above ( see fig .",
    "4 ) : all the low temperature models have @xmath72 close to a region in which @xmath81 passes through a plateau .",
    "these plateaus are the result of changes in the driving mechanism as a function of the density ( which is determined by the value of @xmath4 adopted in the model ) and are thus physically related to the bi - stability jumps discussed by vdkl99,00 .",
    "specifically , the plateau seen here is associated with the balance between fe  iii and fe  ii : in models on the low - density ( i.e. low-@xmath4 ) side of the plateau , fe  iii is the single most important ion for driving the wind while on the high - density side fe  ii provides the largest contribution .",
    "this transition in the driving mechanism leads to the complex shape of the @xmath81 curve .    these plateaus influence the effect of line branching on the derived mass - loss rates .",
    "consider models i and j : for these models , the vertical offset between @xmath81 computed with and without branching is comparable ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . for model",
    "i , @xmath72 occurs at values of @xmath4 beyond the plateau , in a region where @xmath81 varies rapidly with @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to a relatively small difference between @xmath84 and @xmath83 .",
    "however , for model j , @xmath72 lies in the region where @xmath81 varies very slowly .",
    "this means that the difference between @xmath84 and @xmath83 is much greater for this model .",
    "models k , l and m are all similar to , but less extreme than , model j. conversely , model n behaves similarly to model i since it has @xmath72 significantly below the plateau .    taken together , models i ",
    "n ( and also the lower temperature model o ) indicate that the effect of line branching is generally greater at lower temperatures ( b stars ) than at high temperatures ( o stars ) .",
    "they also show that subtleties in the modelling ( in particular changes in the shape of @xmath81 resulting from changes in the driving mechanism around , for example , the bi - stability jumps ) can influence the differential effect of line branching such that it can not be described by a simple scaling with @xmath88 and @xmath80 alone .    for most of the models",
    ", the mass - loss rate computed with resonance scattering agrees with that found by vdkl00 to within a factor of two or better , which is adequate given the differential nature of the calculations presented here .",
    "those models where the agreement is slightly poorer ( models l , k , n and m ) all have self - consistent mass - loss rates ( @xmath84 ) which lie close to plateaus in @xmath81  since @xmath81 varies slowly in these regions relatively minor inadequacies in the models ( i.e. the computation of @xmath94 ) lead to larger errors in the self - consistent value of @xmath4 . in any case , these errors are of little concern since it can be seen from fig .",
    "4 that the differential effect of branching ( the offset between the pairs of curves in the figure ) is not a strong function of @xmath4 .    in conclusion , for hot @xmath95  k stars with luminosity @xmath96 calculations which neglect branching overestimate the mass - loss rate by @xmath97 per cent while for lower luminosity stars with similar temperatures the effect is smaller .",
    "the overestimation factor can be larger for the cooler ( @xmath98  k ) b stars with similar luminosities ( typically about 50 per cent and in extreme cases up to a factor of a few ) and can be significantly affected by variations in the ionisation balance ( and therefore wind driving mechanism ) in the models .",
    "w - r stars have larger mass - loss rates ( up to @xmath99  m@xmath76  yr@xmath77 ) than ob - stars but comparable luminosities . la93 and gayley , owocki & cranmer ( 1995 )",
    "have modelled line driving in w - r winds and shown that the high density means that multiple scattering is very important in these winds ( the wind performance number is typically @xmath100 , far in excess of the single scattering limit ) . thus , since the influence of line branching is linked to the predominance of multiple scattering , w - r star winds are likely to show a large differential effect if line branching is introduced to the calculation .",
    "this effect is quantified here .",
    "the w - r wind model adopted for this study is that of la93 ( @xmath101  m@xmath76 , @xmath102  r@xmath76 , @xmath103  l@xmath76 , @xmath104  km  s@xmath77 , @xmath105  km  s@xmath77 , @xmath106 ) .",
    "these parameters were chosen by la93 to represent a generic wn5 star .",
    "the model is similar to the ob - star models discussed above , the main differences being the temperature stratification and the element abundances .",
    "these are discussed briefly below .",
    "as discussed by la93 and subsequently confirmed by schulte - ladbeck , eenens & davis ( 1995 ) and herald et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , observations suggest that there is a significant outward variation of ionisation in w - r winds .",
    "ionisation stratification has also been predicted theoretically from w - r type models ( e.g. de koter et al .",
    "1997 ) . to account for this ,",
    "la93 imposed a simple variation of radiation temperature with velocity ( their equation 11 ) which is also used here .",
    "their standard value for the radiation temperature at @xmath5 of @xmath107 is adopted here .",
    "the outward variation of electron temperature is less critical to the calculation : it is obtained from the modified milne - eddington temperature distribution ( lucy 1976 ) , following la93 .",
    "in addition , the usual dilution factor ( @xmath20 ) is replaced by the modified dilution factor ( @xmath108 ) defined by la93 .",
    "the same elemental composition used by la93 is adopted .",
    "thus @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the carbon , nitrogen and oxygen are taken from a wne model ( maeder & meynet 1987 ) and the other metal abundances are scaled from solar values to give @xmath111 .",
    "as in the ob - star models , the radiation field at the base of the model @xmath70 is assumed to be black - body with a high energy cut - off at the he  ii ionisation edge .",
    "this cut - off is inconsistent with the adopted ionisation structure ( i.e. if there is really no radiation shortward of the he  ii edge then there are no photons to produce the high ionisation stages by photoionisation ) .",
    "however , this is of little consequence here since in reality there will be a locally produced radiation field that can produce the high ions .",
    "in addition , the calculations presented here are relatively insensitive to the wavelength cut - off in the incident radiation field since most of the input energy is at longer wavelengths : this has been checked explicitly with monte carlo simulations in which the high energy cut - off was placed at higher energy ( by a factor of ten )  the results of those simulations are not significantly different from those presented below .    the black - body temperature adopted for the incoming radiation field is @xmath112 , the effective temperature determined from @xmath6 at @xmath10 . to allow for the higher temperatures deep in w - r winds , the line list used for the ob stars ( see section 4 )",
    "was expanded to include lines from higher ionisation stages ( vii and viii ) of the most important iron group elements ( iron and nickel ) . in the calculations that follow , however , these ion stages provide a negligible contribution ( @xmath113 per cent ) to the radiative driving because of the assumed shape of the input stellar radiation field  most of the energy is at wavelengths that are too long for the packets to interact with the strong lines of these ions .    fig .",
    "5 shows @xmath94 versus @xmath4 for w - r models computed with and without line branching in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "as expected , fig .",
    "5 shows that line branching has a far larger effect on the mass - loss calculation for a w - r star than for ob stars : the difference between @xmath94 computed with and without branching for a given value of @xmath4 is much greater than for any of the models discussed in section 5 .",
    "the self - consistent w - r mass - loss rate determined without branching is @xmath114  @xmath115 yr@xmath77 ( which is close to the value of @xmath116  @xmath115 yr@xmath77 found by la93 ) . when line branching is included",
    "the mass - loss rate is only @xmath117  @xmath115 yr@xmath77 , a reduction by more than a factor of 3 .",
    "note that while some of the cool ob models discussed in section 5 also predicted large reduction factors ( @xmath118 ) , these were not because branching had such a large effect on the computed values of @xmath94 for a given value of @xmath4 but were because of the relative insensitivity of @xmath94 to the value of @xmath4 adopted in the modelling .",
    "the magnitude of this effect can be explained following the discussion of the o stars above .",
    "6 shows the distribution of the number of line scatterings for the w - r model .",
    "the reduction in the number of packets that are scattered many times as a result of line branching is dramatic in the w - r model : without branching , individual packets undergo up to @xmath119 line scatterings ( in a simulation with @xmath120 packets ) but with branching included no packets undergo more than 90 line scattering events . comparing figs . 2 and 6",
    ", shows that multiple scattering is much more important in the w - r model than in the @xmath2  puppis model .",
    "thus photon leakage from one part of the spectrum to another has a much greater influence on the derived mass - loss rate .",
    "7 shows the contribution of the different ions to the mass - loss rate for the w - r model .",
    "the lower panel is from a simulation with resonant scattering only and the upper shows calculations with line branching .",
    "the w - r mass - loss rate is dominated by the iron group elements ( fe and ni ) .",
    "when branching is included the relative contribution of the iron group elements drops and the lighter elements become more important : as discussed in section 5.1 , this is expected because of the greater complexity of the iron group ions .",
    "the effect here is more dramatic than in @xmath2  puppis , but is still small ( the fractional contribution of fe and ni to the line driving is smaller when branching is allowed by only @xmath121 per cent ) .",
    "there is some observational evidence to suggest that the wind acceleration is more gradual in w - r stars than ob stars : e.g. based on infrared data ignace , quigley & cassinelli ( 2003 ) have recently suggested @xmath13 values of 23 for a wn6 star , and they do not rule out larger values . therefore , to investigate the sensitivity of the results presented here to the adopted value of @xmath13 , calculations have been performed using the same w - r parameters as above except that @xmath122 was used for the velocity law . in this case , the derived mass - loss rates were smaller : @xmath123  @xmath115 yr@xmath77 and @xmath124  @xmath115 , with and without line branching , respectively .",
    "the differential effect of line branching is smaller here than for the @xmath106 case , but is still significant ( a factor of @xmath125 ) .",
    "in the previous sections , simple wind models for a range of hot stars have been used to investigate the effect of line branching on mass - loss rates . for o stars , where accurate mass - loss rates are important for evolutionary calculations ,",
    "the overestimation is relatively small , typically @xmath126 per cent and is correlated with the predominance of multiple scattering . for these stars",
    "the difference in the mass - loss rate computed with and without line branching is comparable to or less than typical observational errors in o - star mass - loss rates .",
    "thus , despite the assumption of resonant scattering , in most cases the vdkl00 mass - loss calculations are not significantly in error . in the future , however , when observational constraints become tighter it will be necessary to include line branching in realistic mass - loss calculations .",
    "the effect of line branching in relatively cool ( @xmath98  k ) luminous stars ( early b stars ) is significantly larger than in the hotter stars ( on average about 50 per cent ) , but it is also more sensitive to the details of the modelling .",
    "line branching is most important under conditions typical of a w - r star .",
    "the w - r calculations presented here suggest that neglecting line branching results in an overestimation of the mass - loss rate by a factor @xmath1 for @xmath106 .",
    "the effect is less severe if a larger value of @xmath13 is adopted but is still significant at least for @xmath127 .",
    "this has implications for modelling line driving in w - r stars : branching makes it significantly harder for line driving to accelerate the winds of these stars .",
    "there are many unanswered questions relating to w - r stars , particularly regarding the roles of line and continuum driving throughout their winds .",
    "but the results presented here clearly show that branching significantly influences mass - loss calculations which involve multiple scattering and that future studies of line driving in w - r stars must incorporate these effects .",
