    "the key ingredient of a quantum computer @xcite is that it can simultaneously follow all of the computation paths corresponding to the distinct classical inputs and produce a final state which depends on the interference of these paths . as a result",
    ", some computational tasks can be performed much more efficiently than on a classical computer .",
    "shor @xcite constructed a quantum algorithm which performs large number factorization into prime factors exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm .",
    "it was also shown by grover @xcite that the search of an item in an unstructured list can be done with a square root speedup over any classical algorithm .",
    "these results motivated a great body of experimental proposals for a construction of a realistic quantum computer ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at present ,",
    "quantum gates were realized with cold ions @xcite and the grover algorithm was performed for three qubits made from nuclear spins in a molecule @xcite . for a proper operability , it is essential for the quantum computer to remain coherent during the computation process .",
    "hence , a serious obstacle to its physical realization is the quantum decoherence due to the coupling with the external world @xcite . in spite of that , in certain physical proposals , for example nuclear spins in two - dimensional semiconductor structures",
    ", the decoherence time can be many orders of magnitude larger than the time required for the gate operations ( see for example refs.@xcite ) . as a result",
    ", one can analyze the operation of an isolated quantum computer decoupled from the external world .",
    "however , even if the quantum computer is isolated from the external world and the decoherence time is infinite , a proper operability of the computer is not guaranteed . as a matter of fact , one has to face a many - body problem for a system of @xmath0 interacting qubits ( two level systems ) : any computer operation a unitary transformation in the hilbert space of size @xmath1 can be decomposed into two - qubit gates such as controlled - not and single qubit rotations @xcite . due to the unavoidable presence of imperfections , the spacing between the two states of each qubit fluctuates in some detuning interval @xmath2 .",
    "also , some residual interaction @xmath3 between qubits necessarily remains when the two - qubit coupling is used to operate the gates .",
    "in @xcite an isolated quantum computer was modeled as a qubit lattice with fluctuations in individual qubit energies and residual short - range inter - qubit couplings . similarly to previous studies of interacting many - body systems such as nuclei , complex atoms , quantum dots , and quantum spin glasses @xcite",
    ", the interaction leads to quantum chaos characterized by ergodicity of the eigenstates and level spacing statistics as in random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the transition to chaos takes place when the interaction strength is of the order of the energy spacing between directly coupled states @xcite .",
    "this border is exponentially larger than the energy level spacing in a quantum computer .    in this paper",
    "we show that the onset of chaos leads to occupation number statistics given by the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this means that a strong enough interaction plays the role of a heat bath , thus leading to dynamical thermalization for an isolated system .",
    "in such a regime , a quantum computer eigenstate is composed by an exponentially large ( with @xmath0 ) number of noninteracting multi - qubit states representing the quantum register states . as a result , exponentially many states of the computation basis are mixed after a chaotic time scale and the computer operability is destroyed .",
    "we note that the dynamical thermalization has been discussed in other many - body interacting systems in @xcite .",
    "the paper is composed as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe our qubit lattice quantum computer model @xcite ; in section [ statistics ] we discuss the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of this model ; in section [ thermalization ] we study the occupation number distribution and compare different definitions for the effective temperature of the system ; the conclusions are presented in section [ conc ] .",
    "we consider a model of @xmath0 qubits on a two - dimensional lattice with nearest neighbors inter - qubit coupling @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model , introduced in @xcite , reads : @xmath4 where the @xmath5 are the pauli matrices for the qubit @xmath6 and the second sum runs over nearest - neighbor qubit pairs on a two - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions applied .",
    "the energy spacing between the two states of a qubit is determined by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 randomly and uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "therefore the detuning parameter @xmath2 gives the width of the @xmath10 distribution around its average value @xmath11 . for generality we choose the couplings @xmath12 , which represent the residual interaction , randomly and uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath13 $ ] . the model ( [ hamil ] ) can be considered as a standard generic quantum computer model , in which the unavoidable system imperfections generate a residual inter - qubit coupling and energy fluctuations . in a sense ( [ hamil ] ) describes the quantum computer hardware , while to study the gate operations in time one should include additional time - dependent terms in the hamiltonian . at @xmath14 ,",
    "the noninteracting eigenstates of the model can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 marks the polarization of each individual qubit .",
    "these are the ideal multi - qubit eigenstates of a quantum computer , the quantum register states used for computer operations . for @xmath17 , these states are no longer eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and the new multi - qubit eigenstates are now linear combinations of different quantum register states .    here",
    "we focus on the case @xmath18 , which corresponds to the situation where fluctuations induced by imperfections are relatively weak @xcite . in this case",
    ", the unperturbed energy spectrum of ( [ hamil ] ) ( corresponding to @xmath14 ) is composed of @xmath19 well separated bands , with interband spacing @xmath20 .",
    "since the @xmath8 randomly fluctuate in an interval of size @xmath2 , each band at @xmath14 ( except the extreme ones ) has a gaussian shape of width @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the average number of states inside a band @xmath22 is of the order of @xmath23 , so that the energy spacing between adjacent multi - qubit states inside one band is exponentially small : @xmath24 .    in the presence of a residual interaction @xmath25 ,",
    "the spectrum still has the above band structure with an exponentially large density of states . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the interband coupling is very weak and can be neglected . in this situation ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) is , to a good approximation , described by the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the projector on the @xmath29 band , so that qubits are coupled only inside one band .",
    "we concentrate our studies on the central band . for an even @xmath0",
    "this band is centered exactly at @xmath30 , while for odd @xmath0 there are two bands centered at @xmath31 , and we consider the one at @xmath32 .",
    "the central band corresponds to the highest density of states , and in a sense represents the quantum computer core : an exponentially large number of states allows to take advantage of quantum parallelism in computer algorithms @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum chaos and ergodicity first appear in this band , which therefore sets the limit for operability of the quantum computer . inside this band ,",
    "the system is described by the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath33 which depends only on the number of qubits @xmath0 and the dimensionless coupling @xmath34 .",
    "the results of refs.@xcite showed that the quantum chaos border in ( [ hamil ] ) corresponds to a critical interaction @xmath35 given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is some numerical constant .",
    "this border is exponentially larger than the energy spacing between multi - qubit states @xmath38 .",
    "this is in agreement with previous studies of complex interacting many - body systems @xcite , in which the transition to quantum chaos takes place when the interaction matrix elements between directly coupled states become larger than their energy spacing .",
    "since the interaction is of a two - body nature , each noninteracting multi - qubit state @xmath39 has nonzero coupling matrix elements only with about @xmath0 other multi - qubit states .",
    "therefore , the number of directly coupled states is much smaller than the number of multi - qubit states inside the central band , @xmath40!(n-[n/2])!)$ ] ( we consider the band with the number of spins up given by the integer part of @xmath41 ) .",
    "these couplings induce transitions in an energy interval of order @xmath2 ( we assume that @xmath3 is of the order of or smaller than @xmath2 ) . therefore the energy spacing between directly coupled states is @xmath42 .",
    "the transition to chaos takes place for @xmath43 , which leads to the relation ( [ jc ] ) .    the transition to quantum chaos and ergodic",
    "eigenstates can be detected in the change of the spectral statistics of the system .",
    "a convenient way is to look at the level spacing statistics @xmath44 , which gives the probability to find two adjacent levels whose spacing , normalized to the average level spacing , is in @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath44 goes from the poisson distribution @xmath46 for nonergodic states to the wigner - dyson distribution @xmath47 , corresponding to random matrix theory , for ergodic states @xcite . to analyze the change of @xmath44 with the coupling @xmath3",
    "one can conveniently use the parameter @xmath48 @xcite , where @xmath49 is the first intersection point of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this way @xmath50 corresponds to @xmath52 and @xmath51 to @xmath53 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] gives the dependence of the parameter @xmath54 on the scaled coupling @xmath55 at different system sizes , for states near the middle of the energy spectrum ( @xmath56 of levels around the band center ) . in order to reduce statistical fluctuations ,",
    "we use @xmath57 random realizations of @xmath58 . in this way the total number of spacings @xmath59 is varied in the interval @xmath60 .",
    "the poisson to wigner - dyson crossover becomes sharper when @xmath0 increases , suggesting a sharp transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we note that , since the number of random @xmath58 values is not large , significant fluctuations are present in the @xmath54 curves when one changes the random realization .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 , at @xmath62 , one has @xmath63 in the @xmath64 random realizations considered .",
    "this reflects the general property of fluctuations which become stronger near the critical transition point . on the other hand ,",
    "even if the number of considered spacings is always large , for @xmath65 and especially for @xmath61 , we have only a small number of random realizations , due to the very slow convergence of the lanczos algorithm @xcite near the band center , where the density of states becomes exponentially large .",
    "these fluctuations prevent us from precisely evaluating the critical scaled coupling for the poisson to wigner transition .",
    "the minimum spreading of curves is for @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 , in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "we stress that the chaos border is exponentially larger than the multi - qubit level spacing , e.g. , for @xmath61 , @xmath68 .",
    "the level spacing statistics near the band center is shown in fig.[fig2 ] at different coupling strengths @xmath3 for @xmath69 .",
    "the transition from the poisson to the wigner - dyson statistics is evident . in fig.[fig3 ] we show that , even away from the band center , the transition happens at approximately the same critical coupling .",
    "this is due to the fact that , even if the @xmath0-body density grows exponentially with the excitation energy , the density of coupled states remains roughly the same , except near the band edges @xcite .",
    "we note that the data are shown only for half of the central band ( @xmath70 ) , since the density of states is symmetric around @xmath30 due to the presence of an upper bound in the single qubit energies .",
    "the transition in the level spacing statistics reflects a qualitative change in the structure of the eigenstates @xcite . while for @xmath71 the eigenstates are very close to the quantum register states , for @xmath72 each eigenstate @xmath73 becomes a superposition of an exponentially large number of noninteracting eigenstates @xmath39 .",
    "it is convenient to characterize the complexity of an eigenstate @xmath73 by the quantum eigenstate entropy @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the probability to find the quantum register state @xmath39 in the eigenstate @xmath73 of the hamiltonian ( @xmath76 ) . in this way",
    "@xmath77 if @xmath73 is a quantum register state ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath78 if @xmath73 is equally composed of two @xmath79 , and the maximum value is @xmath80 if all states equally contribute to @xmath73 .    above the chaos border ( @xmath72 )",
    "one eigenstate is composed of order @xmath81 quantum register states , mixed inside the breit - wigner width @xmath82 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the residual interaction disintegrates a quantum register state over an exponentially large number of states after a chaotic time scale @xmath83 @xcite . after this time the quantum computer operability is certainly destroyed , unless one can apply quantum error - correcting codes ( see @xcite and references therein ) operating on a shorter time scale .",
    "this destruction takes place in an isolated system , without any external decoherence process .",
    "it happens due to inter - qubit coupling , which can mimic the effect of a coupling with the external world . in the following",
    "we show that in the quantum chaos regime a statistical description of our isolated @xmath0-qubit system is indeed possible , similarly to results found for other physical systems in @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the distribution of the occupation numbers @xmath84 , defined as the probability that the qubit ( spin ) at the site @xmath6 is in its up polarization state . given an eigenfunction @xmath73 with eigenvalue @xmath85 ,",
    "one can write : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the occupation number operator , and the term @xmath88 equals @xmath89 or @xmath90 depending on whether the spin at the site @xmath6 is up or down .    for noninteracting qubits one can write , e.g. for the central band , @xmath91,\\ ] ] @xmath92 where @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "as @xmath95 , the relations ( [ fd ] ) are the usual ones used to derive the fermi - dirac distribution for an ideal gas of many noninteracting particles in contact with a thermostat .",
    "however , here we consider an isolated system of relatively few interacting particles .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies @xcite have demonstrated that interaction can play the role of a heat bath , thus allowing one to use a statistical description even in an isolated system with few particles .",
    "the fermi - dirac statistics appears due to the fact that the number of spins up / down is fixed and in this way they become equivalent , for the purposes of a statistical description , to electrons / holes .    in fig.[fig4 ] we show the occupation number distribution , averaged over a few consecutive levels @xmath73 and over @xmath96 random realization of @xmath58 , for @xmath69 qubits , both in the integrable regime ( top figures ) and in the quantum chaos regime ( bottom figures ) .",
    "we see that in both cases this averaged distribution is in very good agreement with the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the chemical potential and @xmath99 is the inverse temperature ( we set @xmath100 ) . taking into account the constraint set by the fixed number of spins up ( @xmath101 $ ] ) , @xmath102 is the only fitting parameter .",
    "the goodness of the fit given by the expression ( [ nocc ] ) is hardly surprising as statistical distributions are obtained for noninteracting particles after a correct counting of states . in this procedure",
    ", a weak interaction gives a slight increase of the system temperature @xcite .",
    "a good agreement between the numerical data in fig.[fig4 ] and the theoretical distribution ( [ nocc ] ) does not mean that automatically there is equilibrium and thermalization for a given realization .",
    "this is outlined in fig.[fig5 ] , which shows the occupation numbers for a single eigenstate of a given random realization . in the upper figures ( @xmath103 )",
    "a given eigenstate significantly projects only over a single quantum register state ( @xmath104 ) and therefore half of the occupation numbers is close to @xmath89 , half close to @xmath90 , and the fermi - dirac distribution ( [ nocc ] ) is very far from the actual distribution . on the contrary , in the quantum chaos regime ( lower figures , @xmath105 ) , where a large number of quantum register states are mixed in a single eigenstate",
    ", there is a good agreement between the occupation number distribution and the fermi - dirac distribution .    in order to make quantitative the comparison with the fermi - dirac distribution",
    ", we introduce a parameter which measures the root mean square deviation of the actual distribution from ( [ nocc ] ) : @xmath106 for the case of fig.[fig5 ] , we have @xmath107 ( top left ) , @xmath108 ( top right ) and much lower values above the chaos border : @xmath109 ( bottom left ) , @xmath110 ( bottom right ) . the maximum value @xmath111 is obtained at the band center ( @xmath112 ) for @xmath14 , when @xmath113 for @xmath114 $ ] spins and @xmath115 for the remaining ones .",
    "we introduce the thermalization border @xmath116 as follows : for @xmath117 eigenstates close in energy yield completely different @xmath84-distributions , for @xmath118 the @xmath84-distribution is stable with respect to the choice of a specific eigenstate in a small energy window .",
    "the appropriate quantity to be considered in addition to @xmath119 is the root mean square deviation of the occupation numbers for consecutive eigenstates : @xmath120 for the case of fig.[fig5 ] , we have @xmath121 ( top left ) , @xmath122 ( top right ) and much lower values in the chaotic regime : @xmath123 ( bottom left ) , @xmath124 ( bottom right ) .    the conclusions drawn from fig.[fig5 ] are also applied to fig.[fig6 ] where , thanks to the effectiveness of the lanczos algorithm @xcite near the band edges , it was possible to consider a larger number of spins ( @xmath125 , corresponding to a very large hilbert space dimension @xmath126 , with @xmath127 levels in the central band ) .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] shows the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath128 as a function of the energy , for different values of the coupling strength @xmath3 .",
    "as for the transition to chaos ( fig.[fig3 ] ) , the thermalization occurs at approximately the same critical coupling also away from the band center .",
    "we note that our data give @xmath129 , which can be easily understood as follows : @xmath130 , the last term in the sum becoming negligible after ensemble averaging .",
    "we stress that the very good agreement between the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath128 implies that the fermi - dirac distribution emerges when the occupation number distribution is statistically stable , i.e. the system is thermalized .",
    "the curve for @xmath131 lowers near the band edge since for a small excitation energy @xmath132 a small number @xmath133 of spins ( `` fermions '' ) is available for fluctuations in the vicinity of the fermi level ( see the note @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the temperature @xmath102 obtained from the fermi - dirac fit with different definitions of temperature @xcite , which are known to be equivalent at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "first of all we use the canonical expression @xmath134 where @xmath85 are the exact eigenenergies of the interacting system .",
    "the very good agreement between @xmath102 and @xmath135 ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) supports the validity of a statistical description for our isolated quantum computer model .",
    "this means that in such closed system the inter - qubit residual interaction plays the role of a heat bath in an open system . in particular",
    ", we expect that residual interaction mimics to a certain extent the effect of coupling to external world .",
    "finally we compare the effective temperature @xmath102 with the standard thermodynamic temperature @xmath136 , defined by @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the thermodynamic entropy , with @xmath139 density of states ( here @xmath140 replaces @xmath141 ) .",
    "a gaussian fit , @xmath142 , provides an excellent approximation to the actual data for the density of states , with the exception of the first few levels near the band edges .",
    "therefore one gets @xmath143 , with @xmath144 variance of the gaussian fit .",
    "fig.[fig8 ] shows that the difference between @xmath136 and @xmath145 increases as one moves away from the band center .",
    "this is due to the fact that , contrary to the noninteracting case ( see eq.([fd ] ) ) , the actual system energy @xmath140 is different from @xmath146 , since the total energy is renormalized due to interaction @xcite .",
    "we remark that , not only on average but also for a single eigenstate of a given realization , the agreement between @xmath102 and @xmath135 is good , while @xmath136 becomes closer to @xmath102 and @xmath135 when the excitation energy increases . in the case of fig.[fig5 ] we obtain @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 ( top left ) , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 ( top right ) , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 ( bottom left ) , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 ( bottom right ) .",
    "we also note that the effective temperature diverges at the band center and is negative in the upper part of the spectrum .",
    "this is typical of models with an upper bound in the single particle energies , in which the density of states has a maximum .",
    "the dependence of the thermalization parameter @xmath119 on the scaled coupling @xmath55 at different system sizes is shown in fig.[fig9 ] ( very similar results are obtained for @xmath159 ) .",
    "our data show that the crossover to a thermalized distribution sharpens when the number of qubits increases , in a way consistent with a sharp thermalization border in the thermodynamic limit , at @xmath160 .",
    "the similarity between the results of fig.[fig1 ] ( @xmath161 ) and fig.[fig9 ] leads us to the conclusion that the chaos border coincides with the thermalization border .",
    "this looks quite natural since the poisson level spacing statistics indicates the existence of uncoupled parts in the whole system , thus preventing thermalization . on the contrary ,",
    "in the chaotic regime each eigenfunction spreads over an exponentially large number @xmath162 of quantum register states , resulting in the wigner - dyson statistics . in this regime",
    "the fluctuations of eigenstate components are gaussian @xcite and therefore , according to the central limit theorem , the fluctuations of the occupation numbers are small : @xmath163 . for this reason",
    "eigenstates close in energy give similar @xmath84-distributions , which means that there is equilibrium in the statistical sense .",
    "the results presented in this paper show that the residual inter - qubit coupling can lead to quantum chaos and a statistical description of the occupation numbers in close agreement with the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "we stress that the transition to quantum chaos is an internal process which happens in a perfectly isolated system with no coupling to the external world .",
    "nevertheless , the thermalization which appears in this closed system due to inter - qubit coupling can mimic the effect of an external thermal bath . above the chaos / thermalization border",
    "the quantum register states are destroyed after the chaotic time scale and therefore serious restrictions are set to the quantum computer operability .",
    "below this border the imperfection effects only slightly disturb the ideal multi - qubit states and the quantum computer can operate properly in this regime .        99 a. steane , rep . progr",

    "<S> we model an isolated quantum computer as a two - dimensional lattice of qubits ( spin halves ) with fluctuations in individual qubit energies and residual short - range inter - qubit couplings . in the limit when fluctuations and couplings are small compared to the one - qubit energy spacing </S>",
    "<S> , the spectrum has a band structure and we study the quantum computer core ( central band ) with the highest density of states . above a critical inter - qubit coupling strength , quantum chaos sets in , leading to quantum ergodicity of eigenstates in an isolated quantum computer . the onset of chaos results in the interaction induced dynamical thermalization and the occupation numbers well described by the fermi - dirac distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this thermalization destroys the noninteracting qubit structure and sets serious requirements for the quantum computer operability .    2 </S>"
