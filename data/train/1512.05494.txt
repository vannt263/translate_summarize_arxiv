    "discovery of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) by von klitzing has opened a new era in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it is revealed that the quantization of hall conductance is a manifestation of topologically nontrivial bloch wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "topological matters have various promising applications in many fields , such as fault - tolerant topological quantum computations @xcite , spintronics @xcite and photonics @xcite .",
    "the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) was first predicted theoretically in graphene @xcite and later studied in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hgte quantum well both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "a 3d topological insulator bi@xmath1sb@xmath2 and its family members were also reported @xcite . breaking time - reversal symmetry",
    "can drive a topological insulator into the quantum anomalous hall effect ( qahe ) @xcite .",
    "there are two categories of the qahe classified by the spin chern number @xcite .",
    "one subclass of the qahe is characterized by a vanishing spin chern number .",
    "the cr - doped bi@xmath3se@xmath0 thin film @xcite belongs to this class , where the topological band gap is opened by hybridizations between the spin - up and -down channels .",
    "the other subclass of the qahe has a nonzero spin chern number .",
    "one representative material is the mn - doped hgte @xcite , where the @xmath4-type electrons of hg and the @xmath5-type holes of te experience opposite @xmath6-factors when they couple with the @xmath7 electrons of mn .",
    "the opposite exchange fields felt by the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals enlarge the energy gap in one spin channel , and close and then reopen the energy gap in the other spin channel , which induces a nontrivial topology in the latter spin channel due to the band inversion mechanism  @xcite , for a large enough @xmath6-factor . however , its experimental realization turns out to be difficult due to the paramagnetic state of mn spins .",
    "two other materials are proposed to realize the qahe with nonzero spin chern numbers in honeycomb lattice , a silicene sheet sandwiched by two ferromagnets with magnetization directions aligned anti - parallelly  @xcite , and a perovskite material lacro@xmath0 grown along the [ 111 ] direction with cr atoms replaced by ag or au in one atomic layer  @xcite . in both systems , in addition to the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange field and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , a strong electric field is required to break the inversion symmetry in order to realize the qahe . for the former one , the weak soc of silicene limits the novel qahe to low temperatures , while for the latter one , growth of the perovskite material along the [ 111 ] direction seems to be difficult .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a new material to realize the second subclass of the qahe without any extrinsic operation and easy to synthesize .",
    "it is based on lacro@xmath0 grown along the [ 001 ] direction , where we insert one atomic layer of an inverse - perovskite material sr@xmath0pbo  @xcite such that the pb atom feels the exchange field established by the cr atoms in the parent material . with first - principles calculations ,",
    "we reveal that there is a band inversion at the @xmath8 point between the @xmath7 orbital of cr and the @xmath5 orbital of pb in the spin - up channel induced by the soc , whereas the spin - down bands are pushed far away from the fermi level by the afm exchange field . constructing an effective low - energy hamiltonian",
    ", we explicitly show that the system is characterized by simultaneous nonzero charge and spin chern numbers .",
    "projecting the bands near the fermi level onto the subspace composed of the spin - up @xmath7 and @xmath5 orbitals by maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite , we confirm that a spin - polarized and dissipationless current flows along the edge of a finite sample .",
    "since these two materials are stable in bulk and match each other with small lattice distortions , the composite material is expected easy to synthesize .",
    "the parent material lacro@xmath0 exhibits the perovskite structure with formula abo@xmath0 , where the oxygen atoms form an octahedron surrounding the b atom .",
    "it is a well - known mott insulator with a large energy gap @xmath93 ev , carrying the g - type afm order , where the spin moment of any cr aligns opposite to all its neighbors . on the other hand ,",
    "the material sr@xmath0pbo shows the inverse - perovskite structure with formula a@xmath0bo , where the a atoms form an octahedron surrounding the oxygen .",
    "it was revealed recently that there is a topological band gap in bulk sr@xmath0pbo  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane lattice constant is 3.88   for lacro@xmath0 , and 5.15   for sr@xmath0pbo , different from each other by a factor close to @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , with a @xmath13 rotation around the common @xmath14 axis , these two materials match each other quite well [ see figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) ] . at the interface",
    "the oxygen of sr@xmath0pbo completes the cro@xmath15 octahedron of the perovskite structure [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , which minimizes the distortion to the two materials when grown together . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) zoom - in at the interface , there are two types of cr atoms in each cro@xmath3 unit cell , where cr1 sits at the corners of the square and above the pb atom in the @xmath14 axis , whereas cr2 sits at the center of square and above the oxygen .     grown along the [ 001 ] direction with one atomic layer replaced by sr@xmath0pbo .",
    "( b ) enlarged interface between lacro@xmath0 and sr@xmath0pbo with grey and blue arrows representing spin moments on pb and cr sites , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 are lattice vectors . ]",
    "we have performed first - principles calculations by using density functional theory ( dft ) implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite , which uses the projected augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite .",
    "the exchange correlation potential is described by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) type @xcite .",
    "the cut - off energy of the plane waves is chosen to be @xmath16 ev .",
    "the brillouin zone is meshed into a @xmath17 grid using the monkhorst - pack method . the hubbard - u term is included for the cr-@xmath18 electrons with @xmath19 ev and @xmath20 ev @xcite by using the dudarev method . for the lattice structure , we take @xmath21   @xmath22  )  and @xmath23  .",
    "the height of the inserted sr@xmath0pbo layer is determined by a relaxation process to achieve the minimal energy : @xmath24  , the distance from the pb atom to the cr just above it ( that to the cr below it is @xmath25 ) .",
    "afterwards , the positions of atoms are determined by a second relaxation process with all lattice constants fixed . in both processes ,",
    "the criterion on forces between atoms is set to below 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the results shown below are for a superlattice structure with five layers of lacro@xmath0 and one atomic layer of sr@xmath0pbo .",
    "we confirm that the results remain unchanged as far as the number of lacro@xmath0 layers is above five and for @xmath26 ev .     without ( a ) and with (",
    "solid cyan , solid red and dashed blue curves are for cr1-@xmath27 , pb-@xmath28 and pb-@xmath29 orbitals , respectively .",
    "other colors indicate their hybridizations .",
    "( c ) schematic band evolution of pb-@xmath30 and cr-@xmath31 at the @xmath8 point caused by soc.,width=302 ]    without soc , we find a band gap @xmath32 ev at the @xmath8 point . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the topmost valence band is occupied by the spin - up @xmath33 orbitals of pb , and the lowest conduction band is contributed by the spin - up @xmath31 of cr1 .",
    "the reason for this band arrangement is that the cr1 atom does not live in a closed octahedron due to the absence of an oxygen in the corner of sr@xmath3o layer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , which weakens the crystal field splitting and lowers the energy of the unoccupied cr1-@xmath31 band , whereas the cr2 shares one oxygen with sr@xmath0pbo , thus is closed by a complete oxygen octahedron , which keeps its @xmath31 far away from the fermi level .",
    "therefore , only the spin - up cr1-@xmath31 band appears just above the fermi level , in contrast to the original mott insulator .",
    "meanwhile , the pb acquires a magnetic moment @xmath34 polarized downwards [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , which matches the overall afm order of lacro@xmath0 and splits the spin - up and spin - down @xmath5 orbitals of pb [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] . in this way",
    ", both the topmost valence band and the bottommost conduction band are occupied by the spin - up channel .",
    "we notice that the total magnetic moment in the present system is compensated to zero , distinct from the cr - doped bi@xmath3se@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the band structure of the material is then calculated with soc turned on , which lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bands in both spin channels .",
    "remarkably , the strong soc of the heavy element pb pushes the @xmath35 orbital with up spin even above the fermi energy @xmath37 around the @xmath8 point as displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the cr1-@xmath31 orbital with up spin then has to sink across the fermi level partially in order to maintain the charge neutrality of the system , which causes a band inversion between the @xmath5 and @xmath7 orbitals around the @xmath8 point , as shown in fig .",

    "an energy gap of @xmath38 mev is observed according to the first - principles calculations .",
    "point fitted by the 2@xmath392 @xmath40 hamiltonian ( [ eq : kp ] ) on the basis @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the fitted curves collapse with the dft results within the region @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are lattice constants given in text . ]",
    "we now derive an effective low - energy @xmath40 hamiltonian to describe topological properties of the system . noticing that the topological band gap is opened by hybridizations between the spin - up @xmath35 orbital of pb and the spin - up @xmath31 orbital of cr1 , it is then reasonable to take these two orbitals as a basis to construct a 2@xmath392 hamiltonian . for simplicity",
    ", we denote the two orbitals as @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the effective @xmath40 hamiltonian around the @xmath8 point is @xmath48 on the basis @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the perturbation term with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is the momentum operator in the @xmath55 direction ) .",
    "since the crystal is symmetric with respect to the @xmath56 rotation around the @xmath14 axis , @xmath57 must be invariant under the @xmath58 transformation , where @xmath59 the is the @xmath60-component of the total angular momentum .",
    "the symmetry constraint allows us to determine nonzero entries of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath61 and @xmath62 because @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively . since @xmath67 @xmath68 must vanish .",
    "performing similar calculations for all other terms , we arrive at the hamiltonian respecting the crystal symmetry @xmath69 up to the lowest orders of @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . by fitting the energy dispersion of @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kp ] ) against the first - principles results given in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , we obtain the parameters as follows : @xmath76 ev , @xmath77 ev@xmath78@xmath79 , @xmath80 ev , @xmath81 ev@xmath78@xmath79 and @xmath82 ev@xmath78  ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath83 and @xmath84 take opposite signs , the electronic wavefunction of the spin - up channel becomes topologically nontrivial due to the band inversion mechanism with chern number @xmath85 .",
    "since the spin - down electronic bands are kept far away from the fermi level [ see figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) ] , one clearly has @xmath86 .",
    "it is therefore confirmed that the system is characterized by simultaneous charge and spin chern numbers : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "based on wannierized wavefunctions downfolded from the results of the first - principles calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "red curves are for topological edge states in the spin - up channel , and grey ones are for bulk states . ]",
    "the nontrivial topology gives rise to gapless edge states in a finite sample . to illustrate this feature",
    ", we calculate the dispersion relation for a slab of the topological material with @xmath89 along the @xmath10 axis and infinite along the @xmath11 axis ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . since the bulk bands close to the fermi level are mainly contributed by the pb-@xmath90 , pb-@xmath91 and cr1-@xmath31 orbitals , it is reasonable to downfold the wavefunctions obtained by the first - principles calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) onto these three orbitals . employing the maximally - localized wannier functions @xcite",
    ", we obtain the hopping integrals within the six - dimensional subspace including the spin degree of freedom .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the band structure of the slab system . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , a gapless edge state with up spin appears inside the bulk gap , manifesting the nontrivial topology of the present system .",
    "liu @xcite proposed a 3d spinless model for a layered square lattice with a - type afm ( intra - plane ferromagnetic and inter - plane afm orderings ) . at each lattice site",
    ", there are three orbitals : @xmath4 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "each layer can be driven into a qahe in a same way as that for the mn - doped hgte @xcite . since every two adjacent layers have opposite magnetic moments , their chiral edge states propagate counter to each other .",
    "therefore , the system can be viewed as a stack of quantum spin hall insulators [ see also @xcite ] , where the combination of the time - reversal and the primitive - lattice translational symmetries is preserved .",
    "in contrast , all symmetries are broken in our system , giving rise to a chern insulator .",
    "we propose a novel topological material composed of the lacro@xmath0 of perovskite structure grown along the [ 001 ] direction with one atomic layer replaced by an inverse - perovskite material sr@xmath0pbo .",
    "based on first - principles calculations and an effective low - energy hamiltonian , we demonstrate that the topological state is characterized by simultaneous nonzero charge and spin chern numbers , which can support a spin - polarized and dissipationless edge current in a finite sample . supported by the anti - ferromagnetic exchange field and spin - orbit coupling inherent in the compounds ,",
    "no extrinsic operation is required for achieving the novel topological state .",
    "importantly , these two materials are stable in bulk and match each other with only small lattice distortions , which makes the composite material easy to synthesize .",
