    "lattice qcd offers the best hope for estimating the non - perturbative qcd effects in weak decays of hadrons , thereby allowing the determination of elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix from experimental data .",
    "much of the phenomenological interest is in those weak decays which contain at least one heavy quark , but it is this case where technical issues are often most difficult and conceptual points most subtle .",
    "there are a variety of approaches taken to simulate a heavy quark on today s lattices .",
    "one is to use the improved actions used for light - quark calculations , taking care to keep @xmath1 not too large , and then to rely on an extrapolation ( often guided by the result of a static calculation ) in the heavy quark mass from the charm region to the bottom .",
    "a philosophically - different approach is that of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , namely , to integrate out the heavy quark producing an effective action which is then discretized ; then @xmath1 must be kept large .",
    "a third approach , developed at fermilab , seeks to produce an action which can be used for _ any _ value of @xmath1 , with systematic errors that can be identified and controlled .",
    "an approximation to the full program is often used wherein standard relativistic actions are reinterpreted non - relativistically .",
    "much of the debate focuses on to what extent systematic errors are controlled in this case .",
    "j. sloan gave a nice compare - and - contrast summary of nrqcd and fermilab - type actions at _",
    "lattice 94 _  @xcite .",

    "3 , i present new results , and new analysis of old data , for the @xmath3 parameter of neutral @xmath0 mixing .",
    "4 outlines the successes and limitations of calculations of semileptonic form factors for @xmath0 and @xmath4 decays ; this year has seen the initiation of some new large - scale projects .",
    "5 highlights new developments and results of calculations , presented at this conference , of the phenomenology of quarkonia .",
    "i conclude with a qualitative overview of where we stand , and in what direction future work may be focused .",
    "it has been a banner year for the calculation of @xmath5 , the leptonic decay constant of the @xmath0-meson .",
    "several large groups , having invested many person - years of effort , have presented final results this year ; many of these calculations have done a comprehensive job of estimating systematic errors .",
    "there appears to be a consensus among many of the groups ( see figure  [ fig : fb ] . )",
    "this is encouraging , given the diversity of actions and analyses .",
    "see reference  @xcite for a discussion of discretization errors .",
    "=    the milc collaboration has published their final results this year  @xcite .",
    "they use wilson quarks for both the light and heavy quarks , but use some aspects of the `` fermilab interpretation ''  @xcite , namely the use of non - relativistic normalization and kinetic , rather than pole mass , for the heavy quark .",
    "milc has also found it useful to include static - wilson results to aid in the extrapolation in the heavy quark mass . with wilson heavy quarks in the fermilab interpretation",
    ", there is a @xmath6 error ( physical , _ not _ a lattice artifact ) which can not be extrapolated away .",
    "milc , following jlqcd  @xcite , estimates this effect to be @xmath7 from a tree - level approximation .",
    "milc has been very careful in estimating systematic errors ; changes since their preliminary _",
    "lattice 97 _ results include updates of their chiral extrapolation , the method of combining errors within the quenched approximation , and some new unquenched data to estimate quenching errors .    in t. onogi s _",
    "lattice 97 _ review  @xcite , he reported that although the milc and jlqcd raw data agreed for common parameters , there were some residual differences from the way the scale was set from @xmath8 .",
    "these discrepancies were discussed after last year s symposium by members of each group , and the discrepancies have now been resolved  @xcite .",
    "the fermilab ( fnal ) collaboration have published their final results  @xcite , updated since _ lattice 97_. they used the sw ( clover action ) for both heavy and light quarks , but interpreted non - relativistically ; this includes the use of correctly normalized fields , an additional three - dimensional rotation for the heavy quark in the current , and the use of the kinetic mass to set the quark mass .",
    "they include the full @xmath9 correction , but not the complete @xmath10 correction to the current .",
    "the advantage of their program is that they can `` sit on '' the @xmath11 mass .",
    "they state that their systematic errors are under control , are smaller than their systematic errors , and are smaller than the quenching error which they estimate to be about @xmath12 .",
    "the glok collaboration has published their final results  @xcite updated since _ lattice 97 _ ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "their s is a quenched , @xmath13 , calculation which uses clover light ( tree - level tadpole improved ) and nrqcd heavy quarks .",
    "the hamiltonian includes all @xmath14 corrections , the leading @xmath15 correction , and discretization corrections at the same level .",
    "one important ingredient in the calculation was their axial current renormalization  @xcite .",
    "this was the first use of mass - dependent matching factors and @xmath10 current correction .",
    "they found mixing between lattice currents which does not vanish as @xmath16 because of an @xmath17 lattice artifact term , which can be absorbed into an @xmath18 discretization correction .",
    "the latter is anomalously large ( they found @xmath19 reduction at the @xmath0 mass ) .",
    "furthermore , it can not be included consistently if wilson light quarks are used , that is , if @xmath9 corrections are included for heavy quarks , they must be included for the light quarks as well  one is thus left with sizeable scaling violations if one uses nrqcd - heavy with wilson - light quarks .",
    "glok has augmented their @xmath13 calculation with a @xmath20 run in order to assess scaling violations  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fnal_glok_compare ] compares these nrqcd results of  @xcite with those of fermilab  @xcite . for the @xmath0 meson system ,",
    "the actions are very similar .",
    "the results ought to agree and they do .",
    "=    jlqcd  @xcite has presented preliminary results at this conference , using actions and analysis which follow glok s lead .",
    "they use quenched wilson gauge actions at @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , sw light quarks with a clover coefficient calculated at one - loop , and nrqcd heavy quarks , including both @xmath23 and @xmath14 terms .",
    "their results confirm the features seen by glok ; namely , the contribution from operator mixing of the temporal component of the axial vector current is larger than one would expect  @xcite , and this softens the @xmath24-dependence of @xmath5 , the @xmath25 dependence is large at one - loop , but is expected to be small at two - loop , and the one - loop correction softens the slope of @xmath5 versus @xmath26",

    "clover - heavy data presented last year  @xcite .",
    "they are consistent .    at this conference , lin and lellouch  @xcite presented preliminary high - statistics results of leptonic decay constants using a tadpole - improved tree - level sw quark action for both heavy and light quarks ( with klm normalization for the quark fields ) .",
    "they ran at @xmath13 on a @xmath27 lattice and at @xmath28 on @xmath29 .",
    "they do not attempt a continuum extrapolation , so i , as they , will take their @xmath28 data as their best .",
    "the alpha collaboration  @xcite has proposed a method for systematic improvement of the wilson action and bilinear quark operators to remove all @xmath9 discretization errors .",
    "the program evaluates the clover coefficient and renormalization constants ( of bilinear quark operators ) non - perturbatively .",
    "this year , two new projects have calculated heavy - light leptonic decay constants using this approach .",
    "ape  @xcite and ukqcd  @xcite ran at @xmath28 on @xmath30 and @xmath31 lattices , respectively .",
    "both simulate with the heavy quark near charm to keep @xmath32 errors small ; thus they obtain @xmath33 by interpolation .",
    "however , ape finds that the extrapolation up to the bottom region is quite sensitive to the functional form of the fit ; this inflates their systematic error . in these proceedings ,",
    "ukqcd quotes only statistical errors .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     there has been renewed interest recently , and at this conference we had reports of simulations from fnal ( presented by s. hashimoto  @xcite ) and ukqcd ( d. richards  @xcite ) . a. kronfeld  @xcite , p. boyle  @xcite and j. sloan  @xcite reported on renormalization calculations .",
    "the ukqcd calculation is part of a larger calculation including @xmath34 and @xmath35 form factors as described above .",
    "recall that the clover coefficient is determined non - perturbatively .",
    "the matching coefficient in the renormalized vector current @xmath36 $ ] can be computed for degenerative transitions at zero momentum , and then compared with the alpha collaboration s  @xcite non - perturbative determination of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the striking agreement leads ukqcd to believe that they have good understanding of the discretization errors .",
    "s. hashimoto  @xcite presented preliminary fnal results for @xmath39 , using the same action as for the other semileptonic form factor calculations previously described .",
    "recall they can simulate at the @xmath11 mass ; currently , the light quark mass is around strange .",
    "they consider a _",
    "ratio _ of matrix elements at zero recoil @xmath40 for which statistical errors are small , current renormalization and systematic errors largely cancel .",
    "( this is the same ratio as first defined by mandula and ogilvie  @xcite and then used by draper and mcneile  @xcite for lattice hqet . ) using a corresponding ratio to obtain @xmath41 , they then construct a linear combination to obtain @xmath42 , i.e.  the physical form factor at zero recoil !",
    "previously , lattice calculations had predicted only the slope to constrain the fit to experimental data leaving @xmath43 as the free parameter , and then relied on sum rule calculations of @xmath42 . with this development , hqet and the lattice alone",
    "can determine @xmath44 .",
    "at this conference we saw several interesting calculations of quarkonia .",
    "i will not attempt to put these results in context by making a comparison with a complete list of earlier results , due to space constraints , but rather will take this opportunity to advertise several of these calculations .",
    "presently , the usual approaches used in calculating properties of quarkonia on the lattice are nrqcd ( expansion in @xmath45 ; breaks down for small masses and small lattice spacing ) and the fermilab approach ( improve at @xmath46 ; coefficients are mass - dependent ; present simulations with `` non - relativistic reinterpretation '' of wilson - sw action ) .",
    "problems show up in charmonium hyperfine splitting . at this conference , shakespeare and trottier",
    "@xcite compared the effect of @xmath47 versus @xmath48 terms , and the effect of the detailed way in which mean field is invoked ( mean - link from landau gauge versus from fourth - root - of - plaquette tadpole improvement ) .",
    "they see nrqcd breakdown for @xmath49 ( as expected ) and see a clear preference for using the landau prescription .",
    "it should be noted that this is not an indictment of nrqcd , nor of mean - field improvement .",
    "calculations of bottomonium are well under control . for charmonium ,",
    "the effect of higher order terms is as expected , except that the prefactors are a factor of two or so higher than one would predict from dimensional analysis .",
    "t. klassen  @xcite showed us the first results from a long - term program which provides an alternative to nrqcd or fermilab : symanzik improvement on anisotropic @xmath50 lattices .",
    "his quark action shares some formal similarities with that of fermilab .",
    "it has on - shell @xmath9 classically - improvement plus a non - perturbative @xmath9 improvement which requires a tuning of the wilson parameter @xmath51 .",
    "however , the coefficients of the electric and magnetic terms in the action are mass - independent ( contrast fermilab ) . for his first calculation",
    ", he uses mean - field ( landau ) to estimate these coefficients , and obtains @xmath51 from charmonium dispersion .",
    "his continuum extrapolation is well - behaved .",
    "he sees spectacular agreement with experiment for the charmonium @xmath52-state splitting .",
    "r. horgan  @xcite presented preliminary results of a long - term project using an anisotropic lattice for nrqcd .",
    "their goal is a high statistics calculation for bottomonium and for hybrid mesons .",
    "early results are encouraging and are in good agreement with those from isotropic lattices .",
    "k. hornbostel  @xcite presented a new analysis from the nrqcd collaboration of the bottom ( and charm ) mass .",
    "they used a tadpole - improved nrqcd action including next - to - leading order relativistic and discretization corrections , computed spin - averaged @xmath53@xmath54 splittings to determine the scale @xmath24 , tuned the bare mass so the kinetic mass from the dispersion relation agreed with experiment , perturbatively related the bare mass to the @xmath55 mass ( using a lepage - mackenzie @xmath25 ) , and ran the @xmath55 mass to its own scale .",
    "they obtain @xmath56 from their @xmath13 data ( which has the best statistics ) .",
    "bali and boyle  @xcite have done some nice work in which they measure the potential on the lattice , and then parameterize it to solve the schrdinger equation on ( in)finite lattices .",
    "they then vary the lattice volume and quark masses to deduce from their model qualitative features seen in the full simulations ; namely , non - negligible finite - size effects , a non - trivial dependence on quark mass , and splittings strongly dependent on the coulomb coupling .",
    "i would also like to advertise a calculation of the heavy - quark leptonic width using nrqcd by jones and woloshyn  @xcite , a new estimate of @xmath57 from the sesam collaboration  @xcite , and a study by fingberg  @xcite of the effect of the gluon condensate on the low - lying quarkonium spectrum .",
    "pennanen  @xcite presented results from a study of four - quark systems , while morningstar  @xcite presented final results for the presence of gluonic excitations in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the use of improved actions , techniques , analysis and computer power in recent years has been most fruitful .",
    "lattice qcd has made very useful and competitive predictions of many phenomenological quantities crucial for the confrontation of theory and experiment .",
    "it has been a banner year for the calculation of heavy - light leptonic decay constants such as @xmath5 .",
    "there are now reliable estimates of systematic errors for the quenched calculation , and there is good agreement among groups using a variety of methods . in the near future , we should see if the final analysis ( including a continuum extrapolation ) from conventionally - interpreted sw actions ( which use a non - perturbative estimate of the clover coefficient ) gives results which concur with the clustering of several results obtained from non - relativistic interpretation .",
    "if so , attention must turn to the remaining formidable issue of more reliably estimating the effects of the quenched approximation . with new actions and methods , more attention",
    "should be paid to the heavy - light spectrum , where current estimates of the sensitive hyperfine splitting are too small .",
    "estimates of the @xmath58 parameter from neutral @xmath0 mixing seem rather robust ; since it is determined from a ratio of correlation functions , systematic errors and statistical fluctuations largely cancel .",
    "more modern estimates using wilson or sw actions agree with older results .",
    "the vacuum saturation , or factorization , approximation appears to hold at the @xmath59 level .",
    "earlier variance among results using the static approximation for the heavy quark are better understood , and somewhat reduced .",
    "simulations with an nrqcd heavy quark were presented this year , but need a difficult renormalization calculation for completeness .    for semileptonic decays ,",
    "we need need more complete estimates of systematic errors ( continuum limit , variety of actions )",
    ". it would be nice to see more groups calculating these form factors .",
    "the kinematics of @xmath60 provide a good place to test actions , techniques and analysis . for @xmath61 , the kinematics demand a large , model - dependent , extrapolation in @xmath62 .",
    "( one must also beware discretization errors due to the large bottom mass ; the two philosophies used are the same as for leptonic decay calculations : either attempt to control errors with a non - relativistic interpretation of the action , or simulate around the charm mass , and boldly extrapolate . )",
    "it is unlikely that the large @xmath62 extrapolation can be avoided in the near future with conventional approaches .",
    "it may not be necessary .",
    "we expect our experimental colleagues , using increased luminosities available around the turn of the millennium , to be successful in measuring the form factors at high @xmath62 .",
    "then a direct comparison of theory and lattice results should provide a good estimate of @xmath63 .",
    "the power of heavy - quark - symmetry applied to @xmath64 semileptonic decays has reduced the phenomenologist s dependence on lattice estimates , but the lattice can still make fruitful contributions by providing a reliable estimate of the slope and intercept of the form factor at zero recoil .",
    "new calculations using relativistic heavy quarks have been presented at this conference ; it is welcome to see renewed interest in these form factors .",
    "we expect nrqcd estimates to be available soon and anticipate that within a year or two these , relativistic estimates , and estimates from directly simulating hqet , will all be reconciled as has been the case for leptonic decay constants .",
    "calculations of quarkonia continue to be a good forum for testing new actions and techniques and for predicting parameters of the standard model ; we saw updated estimates of @xmath57 and @xmath65 at this conference .",
    "bottomonium calculations are in good shape ; nrqcd calculations in particular are quite precise .",
    "the convergence of the expansion in inverse mass is poor for charmomium , however , and so this is a good place to try new improved actions .",
    "we saw that anisotropic actions look very promising .",
    "calculations of heavy quark physics on the lattice have reached a new level of maturity in the last few years , and have provided the wider community with reliable non - perturbative estimates of several quantities of phenomenological interest .",
    "but there are still many quantities for which it is difficult to be as precise .",
    "meanwhile , new approaches and techniques mean that the lattice calculations will continue to interesting and important for years to come .",
