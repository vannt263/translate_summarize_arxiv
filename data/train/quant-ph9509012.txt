    "the following two papers deals with the idea of classical spin . they are intended to show that the concept of half - integral spin might be raised also in the realm of a classical theory .",
    "this first paper begins by showing that with some supposition about the half - integer spin particle _ structure _ it is possible to recover all the results derived using quantum theory . in this case",
    ", the language of operators is substituted by a language of functions and the commutator is replaced by the poisson bracket .",
    "functions formally identical with creation and annihilation operators are defined and their interpretation  easier in this formalism  is described .",
    "another function related with the ` number ' operator is also derived and interpreted .",
    "when passing from the passive to the active view , the above mentioned functions become operators and we recover again all the quantum mechanical formalism in heisemberg s notation  only the half - spin case is explicit treated .",
    "the exclusion principle of pauli is also addressed .",
    "it is shown that the model assumed for the half - integral spin particle structure and the imposition upon the eigenfunctions to make diagonal the operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 are sufficient to derive the exclusion behavior ; which now becomes a theorem .    as a secondary result of the picture proposed",
    ", it is shown that a bose - einstein condensation for fermions might be easily interpreted by this theory .    in the second paper ,",
    "the phase - space expressions for the spin functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 are used to derive their equivalent quantum schrdinger equation .",
    "this equation is then solved and we find all the possible half - integral spin eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "we then show quantitatively , why one expects fermionic bose - einstein condensation to take place .",
    "we end this series ( vi and vii ) with our final conclusions .",
    "since its manifestation as a result of the stern - gerlach experiment  among others , the spin has been considered as a purely quantum mechanical manifestation of nature that has no resemblance to any classical behavior .",
    "many physicists defending an epistemological abyss between classical and quantum worlds ( or ontologies ) are now accustomed to cite this effect , the electronic spin , in support to their philosophical views@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the electronic spin could also be predicted from a purely classical point of view , without any reference to quantum mechanics .",
    "this procedure is coherent with our previous developments @xcite .",
    "the main argument here is the fact that , when deriving the electronic spin , one needs not to make reference to any of the quantum postulates .",
    "what one needs to do is to use the lie algebra induced by the product    @xmath4 = i\\hbar \\epsilon _ { ijk}s_k,\\ ] ]    where the @xmath5 are operators and @xmath6 $ ] represents the commutator of these operators , together with some guess about the phenomenon itself revealed by the stern - gerlach experiment .",
    "as everybody knows , the same algebra is induced by the product@xcite    @xmath7    where now the @xmath5 are functions and @xmath8 represents the poisson brackets .    in the next section",
    "we will see that with this product and some _ picture _ or model of the electron internal structure it is possible to derive exactly the same results already derived using the usual formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "we begin this section by making a _ picture _ of the electron structure .",
    "this procedure , of course , might be sustained only under a classical theory since , as is amply known , the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics does not allow us to make world pictures .    this picture of the electron structure will be done based on the expected final results revealed by the stern - gerlach experiment , that is , space `` quantization '' . the resemblances and differences between this approach and the usual quantum mechanical one",
    "will be stressed whenever needed .",
    "we want the electron to be a flat body possessing charge @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 that might have its geometry distorted in the plane perpendicular to its symmetry axis and which is rotating in this plane .",
    "this structure for the electron implies that we shall have @xmath11 if we choose the @xmath12-axis to be the symmetry axis fixed on the electron around which it is rigidly rotating ( see fig .",
    "this geometry implies that the electron is capable of interacting with an external magnetic field @xmath13 with the interaction energy given @xcite by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the angular momentum related to the electron rotation ",
    "we forget for a moment the question about the land g - factor to which we return soon .",
    "the three quantities characterizing the electron are :    * the angular momentum in the z - direction related with its rotation : @xmath16 ; @xmath17 with @xmath18 because of ( [ cond1 ] ) . * the quadrupole moments related to its possible distortions : @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21\\ ] ] where all other quadrupole moments vanish identically because of the condition @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are structure dimensional constants .",
    "we now impose that the description of the electron be made in terms of the three quantities @xmath25 related to the above defined moments as    @xmath26    with this imposition it is easy to demonstrate that the three functions @xmath5 obey    @xmath27    where we will use the classical poisson bracket throughout .",
    "we also see that the functions @xmath28\\ ] ] and    @xmath29 ^2=\\frac{s_0 ^ 2}4\\ ] ]    commute with all the @xmath25 ( expression ( [ 9 ] ) was expected since , as we will see , the functions @xmath5 are the coordinate - momentum representation of the su(2 ) which is of rank one ) .    in terms of these functions ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath30 where we have put the magnetic field in the direction of the @xmath12-axis to write @xmath31 and call @xmath32 the land factor .",
    "the equations of motion for these functions are related with the dynamics of the problem .",
    "they might be obtained as usual by the use of the poisson bracket and are given by    @xmath33    and @xmath34    if we integrate these equations we find @xmath35    @xmath36    equations ( [ 13 ] ) represent a precession taking place in the space defined by the functions @xmath5 .",
    "this precession shall not be confused with one in three - dimensional space , since in this space we postulate from the very beginning that the rotation is taking place rigidly along the symmetry axis .",
    "instead , we might interpret this motion as a vibration of the electron structure over the @xmath37 phase space hyperplane where it can be distorted , since the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are related with the quadrupole moments that take into account such a distortion ( fig .",
    "if we put the magnetic field along the @xmath12-direction and write it as @xmath40 , the equations ( [ 13 ] ) might also be written as @xmath41 which can be written in vector notation as @xmath42 from this last equation we might write the dipole moment of the electron as @xmath43 this justifies the expression ( [ 3 ] ) if we substitute @xmath44 for @xmath45 and the land @xmath46-factor for @xmath47 .",
    "we then expect from a purelly classical argument that the structure of the half - integral spin particles be somewhat like a ring .",
    "we now introduce the functions @xmath48 that are given in terms of the coordinates and momenta as @xmath49 , \\ ] ] and @xmath50 .\\ ] ] these functions satisfy the following commutation rules @xmath51 while for the anti - commutator , defined classically as @xmath52 we get the anti - commutation rules    @xmath53    we can easily identify the element @xmath54 as the unit associated with the product defined by the anti - commutation relation if we note that , for this element @xmath55 and then write the first expression in ( [ 20 ] ) formally as @xmath56    we might also obtain another important element of description of our problem . defining the function @xmath57 as the product @xmath58 it is easy to see that @xmath59 ^2\\ ] ] which is nothing but the casimir operator in this coordinate - momentum representation of the lie group su(3 ) generated by the three functions @xmath5 ( with @xmath22 ) and other five ones that will not concern us here .",
    "the physical meaning of the relations ( [ 19.a],[20 ] ) together with the functions ( [ 18 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 21a ] ) will be clarified in the next section .",
    "until now we were using the passive approach .",
    "in this approach we view the particle as a body with some intrinsic features moving on a fixed background or coordinate system . these features , like its rotation around the @xmath12-axis ,",
    "are described by the _ functions _",
    "@xmath5 ( e.g. for the rotation around the @xmath12-axis we have @xmath2 ) .",
    "we now pass to the active point of view .",
    "in the active approach , the particle is neither rotating nor being distorted by some applied magnetic field . in this case , the particle is maintained fixed in space and is viewed as generating symmetry operations upon the space itself ( e.g. the electron generates the rotation along the @xmath12-axis and this operation is now represented by the operator @xmath60 ) .",
    "since we know that the functions @xmath5 are the generators , in the coordinate - momentum representation , of the su(2 ) symmetry group , the operators related to them are automatically obtained ( for the half - spin case ) as the pauli operators , written in matrix form as s functional appearance and that this implies a great degree of arbitrariness .",
    "the reader is correct but we might also complain that the same is done in the usual quantum mechanical treatment when one chooses the @xmath61 operator to be @xmath62 , based in the results obtained in the stern - gerlach experiment and , after that , derive the other two pauli operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in both cases , of course , one is driven by the known behavior of the electron under the influence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the classical path is different from the quantum one just in the sense that it claims for a picture of the electron , something the quantum procedure does not . ]",
    "@xmath65 so that our @xmath44-functions shall be proportional to them and might be written , in this matrix representation , as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an yet undetermined constant that will be obtained from the experiments ( e.g. the stern - gerlach experiment ) and is indeed known to be plank s constant @xmath68which we will hereafter write instead of @xmath67 .",
    "this definition of the @xmath5 functions also assures that we have obeyed the usual commutation relation @xmath69 = i\\hbar \\epsilon _ { ijk}\\hat s_k.\\ ] ]    the hamiltonian related to the interaction of the particle with an external magnetic field becomes @xmath70 using expression ( [ 17 ] ) we get    @xmath71    and @xmath72 with the commutation relations  in terms of the matrix commutator",
    " given by    @xmath73 = \\hbar \\hat s_3\\mbox { ; } % \\left [ \\hat s_{+},\\hat s_{+}\\right ] = \\left [ \\hat s_{-},\\hat s_{-}\\right ] = 0,\\ ] ]    while the anti - commutation relations are    @xmath74 _ a=\\hbar { \\bf 1}\\mbox { ; } % \\left [ \\hat s_{+},\\hat s_{+}\\right ] _ a=\\left [ \\hat s_{-},\\hat s_{-}\\right ]",

    "it is easy to see that the operators @xmath75 and @xmath82 are the normal modes associated with the distortions of the particle in the @xmath37-hyperplane referred to after expression ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that we have @xmath83    we might now modify our terminology of the operator @xmath84 from symmetry generators to operators related with particles and occupation numbers . in this case , @xmath85 is the vacuum state and @xmath86 the first occupation state and @xmath75 behaves as a particle creation operator while @xmath76 behaves as a particle annihilation operator .",
    "this terminology , however , might be misleading .",
    "the operators @xmath75 and @xmath87are only entities allowing one to get one independent mode of distortion in the @xmath37-plane from the other .",
    "there are no particles being created nor annihilated .    by using the particle terminology and looking at expression ( [ 29 ] )",
    "we might say that it is not possible to find any state with more than one particle .",
    "it is easy to define a number operator given by @xmath88 with matrix representation written as @xmath89 for which    @xmath90    justifying the name just given to it .",
    "returning to the expression ( [ 21a ] ) , now written in operator format , @xmath91 we might also interpret this operator @xmath92 as representing the net ` angular momentum ' related with the distortions . then , the result @xmath93 is related with the fact that no distortion is present , while the result @xmath94 implies that the particle is being distorted .",
    "the condition that @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the only possible eigenvalues of the operator @xmath57 means that the particle is capable of being in only two states  one with and another without distortion in the @xmath37-hyperplane .",
    "we can also explain why the particle symmetry group is su(2 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath97 and @xmath39 or their related operators are not true angular momenta but rather components of a tensor . in this case",
    "it is known that when we perform rotations upon the coordinates by an angle @xmath98 around their symmetry axis , using the rotation group of which @xmath98 is the sole parameter , these tensors are transformed by an angle @xmath99 and so , are related with the covering group su(2 ) of o(3 ) .",
    "since the beginning of quantum mechanics the behavior of exclusion presented by electrons ( and all half - integral spin particles ) is introduced into non - relativistic quantum mechanics by means of a principle , an axiom , called the exclusion principle due to pauli .",
    "it is amply believed that the correct place to fit this problem is relativistic quantum mechanics where dirac s matrices arrive naturally and obey anticommutation relations . from the point of view of this paper",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the spin , it was shown is not a relativistic effect although it is more correctly addressed within the realm of this theory  as all other phenomena . in relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "the spin shall have other degrees of freedom , for questions of invariance , related with the coupling of these degrees of freedom with the electric field .",
    "this is represented by the lorentz invariant potential@xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the dirac s matrices and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the magnetic and electric fields respectively .    in dirac s theory , the matrix representation of the spin is related with 4-spinors  in contrast with pauli s 2-spinors  where all these degrees of freedom are made explicit . the use of spinors , however , need not be considered fundamental for the theory .",
    "it reflects just a separation of the problem into two different approaches  one in which the spatial coordinates are treated analytically , by means of the schrdinger equation , and the other in which the intrinsic problem is treated by matrix algebra , following the heisemberg original approach .",
    "such an approach could be also used in the non - relativistic hydrogen atom , for example , treating the angular operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 as matrices and so obtaining , for each quantum number @xmath107 of operator @xmath106 , a @xmath108-spinor .",
    "the use of matrix representation for the spin is made because it is tacitly assumed among the scientific community that the spin can not be represented by ordinary analytical functions .",
    "this follows from another general faith that the spin has no classical analogous and so , is not suitable to quantization .",
    "this argument , however , can not be correct if we accept that there is a total correspondence between the schrdinger s and heisemberg s calculus . in the continuation paper ( vii )",
    ", we will present an analytical equation accounting for the particles half - integral spin .    for the present section we are interested in showing that the results presented until now are the only ones necessary to introduce the notion of exclusion .",
    "this means that the behavior of exclusion will be consequence of the particle geometry which is also responsible for the existence of spin .    to begin with ,",
    "let us consider two independent half - spin particles described by the two sets of functions @xmath109 with the commutation rules @xmath110 and @xmath111    it is easily to work in the active view with the matrix representation .",
    "in this case we are interested in the tensorial space @xmath112 with the probability amplitudes defined by @xmath113 .",
    "it has to be stressed that we are looking for a set of vectors making simultaneously diagonal the operators @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "it can be verified that we have @xmath116 and we shall choose some combinations of the vectors @xmath113 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 obeying @xmath119 that are still eigenvectors of the operators defined in expression ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that the only two possible combinations that are still eigenvectors of the first operator in ( [ 39 ] ) are the two symmetrized vectors @xmath120 and have both zero as their eigenvalue as related to operator @xmath2 .",
    "the negative sign is then chosen using the anticommutation rule related with operators @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the only solution for the problem becomes @xmath123 as expected . in matrix notation",
    "this vector can be written as @xmath124 which is a statement of the exclusion behavior .",
    "we then conclude that fixing the geometry of the particle structure , which induces the anticommutation relations for the operators @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and the need to make diagonal the operator @xmath125 are sufficient to obtain the exclusion behavior of entities with half - integral spin  we will prove in paper vii of this series that all half spin particles are included in our calculation .",
    "the picture for the electron made above has other secondary , but not unimportant , consequences .",
    "one of the most striking ones is related with einstein - bose condensation .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the disappearance of exclusion behavior for very low temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we will address this problem qualitatively and show that we expect such phenomenon to appear . in the continuation paper ( vii ) ,",
    "where the half - integral spin schrdinger equation will be solved exactly , the problem will be dealed with by quantitative calculations .    the most important thing",
    "to stress is that the internal energy of the electron is given if we consider the function @xmath126\\ ] ] and remember that it will give rise , in schrdinger representation , to an eigenvalue equation @xmath127 where planck s constant was introduced to make @xmath128 a number without dimension",
    ".    equation ( [ eb2 ] ) might be written , after quantized , as @xmath129 \\psi = \\hbar \\lambda \\psi .\\ ] ] it might be easily checked that the ration @xmath130 shall have dimensions of mass / time and we can represent it as @xmath131 where @xmath10 is the mass of the particle and @xmath132 is some frequency related to the specific particle under consideration . equation ( [ eb3 ] ) becomes @xmath133 \\psi = \\hbar \\omega \\lambda \\psi , \\ ] ] with a related _ internal _ energy given by @xmath134    equation ( [ eb6 ] ) is our fundamental equation .",
    "it is noteworthy that we do not expect the quantum number @xmath128 to have zero as one of its possible values .",
    "this is because we admitted from the very beginning that the particle is spinning around some fixed direction and so , must have some internal energy ",
    "this is a striking difference from fermions to bosons . in this case",
    "we expect @xmath135 for some constant @xmath57 .",
    "let us suppose now that we have a confined fermion gas and we begin to drop its temperature .",
    "the fermions energy is the sum of their translation energy plus their internal energy .",
    "the energy is being extracted from the fermions translational kinetic energy .",
    "this process continues until the temperature reaches a value such that one fermion looses not only its translation energy but also its internal energy .",
    "we then say that the fermion ` freezes ' .",
    "when the fermion freezes , its internal energy is under the minimum value @xmath136 and the equation ( [ eb2 ] ) will not have any solution .",
    "the operator @xmath3 defined above will not define an eigenstate either .",
    "we might then say that the group generated by the fermion will not be su(2 ) anymore .",
    "it will no longer be a fermion and condensation will take place  it is like if the possibility for the fermion to rotate and deform assures the exclusion ; when the temperature drops to an exceeding low value , the internal state related with these degrees of freedom of the internal movements is no longer allowed and the fermion freezes  it is important to stress that this is not a collective behavior .",
    "all the considerations above will be approached quantitatively in the continuation paper ( vii ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to make a model of the half - integral spin particles in the realm of a classical theory .",
    "it was also shown how the passage from the passive to the active views might introduce all the ` quantum mechanical ' results .",
    "these results then show , for those who believe in some abyss between classical and quantum physics , that the half - integral spin particles are not specific of quantum mechanics .    as one consequence of the present development , it was possible to present an explanation of the intriguing phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation for fermions .",
    "we are now in position to ` quantize ' the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 to obtain a schrdinger - like representation  eigenfunctions  for the half - integral spin particles .    in the continuation paper vii",
    "we proceed to make the quantum calculations and to treat the bose - einstein condensation problem in a quantitative way .",
    "the author wishes to thanks the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) for sponsoring this research ."
