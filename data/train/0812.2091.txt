    "the recent discoveries of ever - mounting transition temperatures in the superconducting iron arsenside 2-dimensional layered compounds , coupled with the goal of understanding the pairing mechanism(s ) of this newly discovered class of superconducting compounds , has lead to a surge of activity in materials - based condensed matter physics .",
    "> from a superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 = 26 k in lafeas(o@xmath5f@xmath2)@xcite the value is now up to @xmath4 = 55 k in smfeas(o@xmath5f@xmath2)@xcite . of particular help in the quest for understanding this new physics",
    "has been the widening range of compounds in which the `` iron arsenide ( feas ) '' based superconductivity has been found , moving from the rather difficult materials synthesis of the original 1111 compounds with f - doping to the more - easily - prepared 122 compounds ( non - superconducting prototype bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) discovered by rotter _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite these latter compounds , as was pointed out by ni _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite can be rather easily grown from a sn flux as well as from an feas self flux@xcite .",
    "thus , much of the recent effort for elucidating the physics has focused on these 122 compounds , with both polycrystalline and single crystal work .",
    "single crystals of course allow greater homogeneity and the possibility of following the anisotropy of the fundamental properties - often important in distinguishing the underlying mechanisms of superconductivity@xcite .",
    "a central question@xcite for deciding on the superconducting pairing mechanism in these feas superconductors has been the interplay / relationship between the ubiquitous magnetic behavior in the undoped , non - superconducting starting compounds ( either the 1111 family or the @xmath6fe2as2 , where @xmath6 = ca , sr , ba , and eu ) which is then suppressed by the doping . in the 122 family , k / na / cs , or hole doping , on the @xmath6-site or co / ni - electron doping@xcite - on the fe site )",
    "induces superconductivity .",
    "whether the magnetic ( spin density wave , sdw ) behavior is coupled to the occurrence of superconductivity in srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 doped with co is a main subject of the present work , using single crystals prepared in sn flux .",
    "the question `` does the sdw coexist with superconductivity in feas superconductors ? '' might seem straightforward to answer .",
    "however , even in just the 122 compounds , there exist at present four starting compounds @xmath6fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath6 = ca , sr , ba , and eu ) with both hole ( including work on na , k and cs ) and electron ( co and ni ) doping , and as well the very important materials aspects of both single- and poly - crystalline samples .",
    "even a cursory review of the current status of this 4 ( ca , sr , ba , eu ) @xmath7 2 ( hole / electron ) @xmath7 2 ( single / poly ) phase space for just the 122 compounds already reveals both large differences but also serious conflicts between the various results . the rate at which doping depresses @xmath8 and induces superconductivity varies widely between the various @xmath6 atoms and either hole- or electron - dopants , which is a sign of the richness of this new class of materials",
    ". however , there are also conflicts in some results on the same @xmath6 atom and the same dopant which involve disagreements in concentration dependence of , _ e. g. _ , @xmath8 , in whether the sdw transition is first or second order in , _ e. g. _ , srfe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite , and even in the quite fundamental question of coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity itself ( see table 1 ) .",
    "our work on the electron doped srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is the first to be done on single crystals in this compound ( with one report on polycrystalline samples@xcite and one on thin films@xcite ) , bringing an initial data set for the 4 @xmath7 2 @xmath7 2 set closer to completion .",
    "srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals show a structural phase transition from a high - temperature tetragonal phase to a low - temperature orthorhombic phase at the same temperature as the sdw , @xmath9 = 198 k @xcite similar to the behavior observed in the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compound@xcite .",
    "as summarized in table 1 , the relation between magnetic behavior and superconductivity in the 122 feas superconductors has been addressed quite thoroughly for @xmath6 = ba , but somewhat less so for @xmath6 = ca , sr , and eu . there is also growing work on electron doping ( primarily co replacing fe ) for all the @xmath6 species listed . as detailed in table 1 , at present the question of whether magnetism in the form of a sdw coexists with superconductivity in doped @xmath6fe@xmath0as@xmath0 is still controversial .",
    "some of the disagreement in resolving the issue of coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in the doped 122 @xmath6fe@xmath0as@xmath0 materials made apparent by the summary in table 1 can be resolved as merely based on interpretation .",
    "for example , some authors ( _ e . g. _ see refs .",
    "@xcite ) have stated that the sdw transition is suppressed based on the lack of sharp structure in @xmath10 vs @xmath11 data , although a shoulder that might be indicative of a weak transition exists in their data . however , some of the disagreements appear to be fundamentally unresolvable at this time .",
    "one example of this involves contrasting @xmath8 vs @xmath3 results even in high quality single crystals of bafe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 by x. f. wang _ _ et al.__@xcite and by j .- h .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite such disagreement is independent of any interpretation .",
    "two important lessons to be drawn from the summary in table 1 on single crystal srfe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 are : ( 1 ) a fine gradation in composition in bafe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 was shown to be necessary for determining whether @xmath8 has been suppressed to @xmath11 = 0 when superconductivity first appears@xcite ( 2 ) some of the work on polycrystalline samples has been found to disagree with single crystal work , partly at least for reasons still under discussion , thus obscuring any possible conclusions . in general , although single crystals grown in sn - flux can have small inclusions of sn@xcite , single crystals should be more homogeneous than sintered polycrystalline material . in order to address point ( 1 )",

    "however , as will be discussed below , @xmath8 is suppressed much less rapidly with co in srfe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 than in bafe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 , and our present work on @xmath3 = 0 and 0.4 is sufficient to show the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in srfe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 - contradicting conclusions based on polycrystalline srfe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0@xcite(see table 1 ) .",

    "<S> in order to investigate whether magnetism and superconductivity coexist in co - doped srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , we have prepared single crystals of srfe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 , @xmath3 = 0 and 0.4 , and characterized them via x - ray diffraction , electrical resistivity in zero and applied field up to 9 t as well as at ambient and applied pressure up to 1.6 gpa , and magnetic susceptibility . at @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> = 0.4 , there is both magnetic and resistive evidence for a spin density wave transition at 120 k , while @xmath4 = 19.5 k - indicating coexistent magnetism and superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of how these results compare with reported results , both in srfe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 and in other doped 122 compounds , is given . </S>"
