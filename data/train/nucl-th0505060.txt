    "duality in the nucleon structure function , @xmath2 , was discovered before quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",

    "@xmath7 is the final - state hadron mass .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of duality appears to be local in the sense that it exists in each interval of @xmath8 over the prominent nucleon resonances .",
    "an explanation of bloom - gilman duality was offered by de rujula , georgi , and politzer in 1977 @xcite . using the operator product expansion , they represented the scaling function as a sum of various twist operators , and then studied the contributions from individual twists ( moments of the scaling functions ) in the scaling variable , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "they argue that the @xmath11 moment , @xmath12 , of @xmath13 has the following twist expansion ,    @xmath14    here , @xmath15 is a mass scale @xmath16 , and @xmath17 depends logarithmically on @xmath18 , being roughly on the order of @xmath19 . according to eq .",

    "1 would not correspond to positive definite functions .",
    "thus one might expect the structure functions to oscillate when large @xmath22 is important , and this would lead to the appearance of local duality .",
    "a more recent study of parton - hadron duality by ji and unrau @xcite gives more quantitative estimations .",
    "there is no doubt that duality is a very interesting phenomenon , and it could allow one , under certain circumstances , to bridge the gap between perturbative predictions and experimentally observed quantities in non - perturbative regions @xcite .",
    "however , duality , as expressed in the above analyses , only reflects properties of the parton structure functions . appealing to the concept of factorization in the strong interaction ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether there is duality in the parton fragmentation sector .",
    "although in twist - two , perturbative calculations , parton structure functions and parton fragmentation functions have some similarities , this does not indicate that they have similar higher twist expansions .    recently , an experiment at the jefferson national acceleration facility , jlab e00 - 108 , studied duality in semi - inclusive @xmath23 reactions .",
    "semi - inclusive reactions can reflect higher twist contributions in the parton fragmentation sector , so it is worthwhile to study these contributions in more detail in order to understand how one might extract these contributions in such reactions .",

    "the quantities that can not be directly measured are @xmath127 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath166 , and @xmath114 .",
    "one can determine @xmath127 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath166 based on energy and momentum conservation and the measurements of @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 with the following equations , @xmath178 also @xmath114 can be determined through the above determination of @xmath166 and the measurements of @xmath171 , @xmath179    with eqs .",
    "( 38 ) and ( 39 ) , one can determine @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath114 of the hadron production processes and then obtain the cross section versus @xmath114 . comparing the cross sections at various @xmath181 but with the same @xmath180 and @xmath114 , one can deduce the higher twist contributions from the fragmentation sector .",
    "we have studied possible higher twist qcd contributions in the fragmentation sector . in summary",
    "we find the following .    1 .   the contributions to @xmath182 cross section can be expanded as contributions of operators with various twists . if @xmath183 , twist - two operators are the dominant contribution . as one decrease @xmath124 ,",
    "higher - twist contributions become more and more important .",
    "if the sign of the coefficients in higher - twist contributions are not positive definite , oscillation similar to duality in @xmath1 inclusive scattering could appear .",
    "as @xmath124 becomes low , qcd becomes completely non - perturbative , and the twist expansion becomes meaningless .",
    "a study of higher - twist contributions can be carried out through @xmath27 by comparing measurements of cross sections versus @xmath114 at various @xmath124 . in order to carry out the same study using @xmath125",
    ", one needs to make sure that the higher twist contributions from the parton structure sector are well determined , so that one can isolate the contributions from the fragmentation sector .",
    "one way to achieve this is to choose large enough @xmath123 so that the contributions to the cross section from the structure sectors are dominantly from twist - two operators , which can be calculated with well measured structure functions and perturbation qcd . to achieve higher @xmath123 but different @xmath124 , one can suitably choose the detector angles carefully in @xmath125 experiments for various beam energies .",
    "we have not attempted to study the evolution of the ratio,@xmath184 as a function of @xmath114 .",
    "however we suggest that this ratio contains information of the higher twist effects in the fragmentation sector and should be studied in the future .",
    "4 .   to adopt the fragmentation functions obtained in @xmath182 in the process of @xmath125 , redefinitions of @xmath124 and @xmath114 are necessary .",
    "we currently use the definitions in eq .",
