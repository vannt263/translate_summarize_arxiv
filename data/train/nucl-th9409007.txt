    "open charm production , direct photon , and dilepton production are among the most direct probes@xcite of the early time evolution of the quark - gluon plasma produced in ultra - relativistic nuclear reactions . at collider energies",
    "@xmath3 agev the initial mini - jet plasma is mostly gluonic@xcite with a quark content far below its chemical equilibrium value .",
    "furthermore , the initial transverse momentum distribution of those gluons is very broad@xcite resembling a hot thermal gas of gluons with an effective temperature @xmath4 mev @xcite .",
    "because charm is produced mainly through gluon fusion , open charm production provides a probe of that initial gluonic state .",
    "in contrast , hidden charm@xcite is mostly sensitive to final state interactions in the later stages of evolution .",
    "photons and dileptons are complementary probes of the evolution of the suppressed quark component of the plasma .",
    "the present study is motivated by two recent studies @xcite of open charm which predicted widely different rates in nuclear collisions . in ref.@xcite",
    "the pre - equilibrium contribution was found to be almost equal to initial gluon fusion rate .",
    "a similar factor of 2 enhancement of charm from thermal production in hot - glue scenario was also suggested@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", a more provocative claim was made that open charm may even be enhanced by over an order of magnitude above the initial pqcd rate .",
    "the main result of our present study is that correlations between the rapidity @xmath1 and the space - time rapidity @xmath2 lead to a large suppression ( about a factor of 40 ) relative to the uncorrelated case .",
    "thus , the pre - equilibrium open charm production is found to be unfortunately a very small fraction of the initial fusion rate .",
    "the large enhancement of charm production in ref .",
    "@xcite is found to be due to an overestimation of the contribution from the flavor excitation processes and the use of a low energy @xmath5 scaling from @xmath6 reactions measured at @xmath7 gev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - initial ] the dependence of the direct pqcd rates for charm production on structure functions , @xmath8 scale , and @xmath9 factor is reviewed and compared to existing data .",
    "the beam energy dependence and the @xmath10 dependence of the initial charm production are compared to results in ref.@xcite . in section",
    "[ sec - pre ] , the pre - equilibrium charm production is calculated .",
    "the mini - jet rapidity and transverse momentum distribution are fit to results of the monte carlo hijing model@xcite including initial and final state radiation .",
    "three different models for the space - time and momentum correlations are studied and the influence on the charm yield is calcualted .",
    "of the three models , we concentrate on a minimally correlated model resulting from uncertainty principle , which is similar to the type of correlation assumed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also study the sensitivity of the results to different models of the formation physics @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec - summary ] contains the summary .",
    "heavy quark production in @xmath6 reactions was calculated long ago in ref.@xcite including both fusion and heavy flavor excitation processes in the leading order pqcd .",
    "it was proposed that the flavor excitation processes were dominant at high energies because a small @xmath8 exchange can easily liberate any charm component in the nucleon while gluon fusion was suppressed because @xmath11 . in the parton cascade",
    "model@xcite , both mechanisms are incorporated to calculate @xmath12 quark production in nuclear collisions .",
    "there the results suggested that the flavor excitation of the charm quark of nuclear structure functions would be the dominant source of charm production in nuclear collisions as well .",
    "however , it is pointed out@xcite that the original flavor excitation rates in ref.@xcite were too high in the @xmath13 region due to neglected interference with other pqcd amplitudes to the same order . when all diagrams were added together ,",
    "a large destructive interference was found to suppress the flavor excitation rates by powers of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a typical qcd scale and @xmath16 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "the suppression factor appears to the process @xmath17 where the charm is evolved from the structure functions using _ perturbative _ qcd , as also shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "we note that there is a possible non - perturbative charm component ( intrinsic charm ) in the nucleon .",
    "there are experimental constraints on the amount of that non - perturbative charm component@xcite .",
    "the total contribution of the intrinsic charm was shown in refs.@xcite to be small ( about 10% ) in the midrapity region where most of the charm is made .",
    "although the contribution of the intrinsic charm component appears important at large @xmath18 , its contribution to the total cross section is small and well within the uncertainties from other sources .    in this paper",
    "we only include fusion processes for the parton level cross sections as in ref.@xcite . for the production in @xmath19 collisions",
    ", we use the light quark and gluon structure functions from glck et al.@xcite and duke - owens@xcite for comparison .",

    "in general , k - factor depends on the choice of parton distribution functions , the center of mass energy of the collision , and the type of the projectile and target particles .",

    "the values for the other data lines are computed from d - meson cross sections according the argument in ref.@xcite by using the published experiment results@xcite .",
    "earlier experiment results @xcite also show big uncertainties among the different experiments .    in fig .  1 we see that both the solid curve and the dashed curve fit the low energy data reasonably well , so we use these two parametrizations for the following high energy calculations in this section . as a consistency check",
    ", we also plot the long - dashed curve using the same parameters as in fig .  1 of ref.@xcite ( i.e. do1 , @xmath35gev , @xmath48 ) using constant @xmath49 for simplicity . comparing the solid and dot - dashed curves",
    "shows the strong dependence on the assumed charm quark mass for the grv - ho set . comparing the solid and dashed curve",
    "we see that different choices for the @xmath8 scale can be compensated for by shifts in the @xmath9 factor .",
    "these results together with the large uncertainty of data emphasize the need to measure @xmath6 and @xmath50 to fix uncertainties in the initial charm production rate in order that charm production in @xmath39 can be properly calculated .",

    "glauber geometry for central high @xmath57 collisions gives @xmath58 .",
    "2 the solid curve is our result using the same parameters as for the solid curve in fig .  1 . the parametrization for the dashed curve in fig .",
    "1 gives a curve higher than the solid curve by 15% to 30% .",
    "the four long - dashed curves , curve1 to curve4 , are all from pcm calculations@xcite .",
    "the top curve4 is the parton cascade model result for the so - called qgp formation case , including both the fusion and the flavor excitation processes .",
    "that curve is higher than our solid curve by about an order of magnitude because it includes the contribution from flavor excitation processes .",
    "curve3 , the curve with filled squares , shows the contribution to curve4 from fusion processes only ( processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the notation of ref.@xcite ) , and curve3 is very close to our results . the bottom curve1 is the estimate without qgp formation by extrapolating the parton model @xmath6 result to @xmath39 using @xmath59 scaling . it is lower than our solid curve by a factor of @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "the main source of this difference is from the a - dependence of @xmath62 cross sections .",
    "ref.@xcite used an @xmath5 scaling with @xmath63 @xcite instead of the value @xmath64 we use from glauber geometry .",
    "we note that the value @xmath63 is taken from low energy experiments , where energy conservation suppresses the contribution from multiple collisions . at high energies ,",
    "qcd factorization implies that @xmath64 for @xmath62 scaling is the appropriate scaling modulo small nuclear shadowing effects . to demonstrate this effect from different @xmath5 scaling , we multiply curve1 by a factor of @xmath65 and get curve2 , which is close to our results . in summary ,",
    "the factor @xmath66 enhancement of charm production suggested in ref.@xcite comparing curve1 with curve4 for charm production at @xmath67 is a consequence of the inclusion of incoherent flavor excitation processes and the extrapolation from @xmath6 to @xmath39 via low energy scaling .",
    "given the coherent suppression of the flavor excitation processes @xcite and the high energy scaling under consideration , it is only sensible to compare curve2 with curve3 . in that case fig .",
    "2 leads to the expectation that the pre - equilibrium charm production should be comparable to the initial fusion rate .",

    "the resulting transverse momentum distribution of mid - rapidity mini - jet gluons at @xmath90 agev is shown by the open circles in fig .",

    "the soft+hard , hard , and monte carlo distributions are very close to each other in the semi - hard @xmath93 gev region at @xmath94 , as seen in fig .  5 .",
    "however the parametrized distribution falls underneath the monte carlo result in the region @xmath95 gev .",
    "we emphasize that the soft component is strongly model dependent as it requires the furthest extrapolation from the pqcd hard domain .",
    "the hijing yield in that region is due to initial and final state radiation .",
    "other contributions in this soft domain from coherent string are possible@xcite .",
    "while most of the following results are obtained with the simple parametrization above , we will check the sensitivity to variations of the soft component as well .",
    "we also note that at bigger rapidity the @xmath41 spectrum falls more rapidly .",

    "there would be more sensitivity had the production been dominated by low @xmath41 components .",
    "we also see that for the soft+hard distribution the soft gluons significantly increase the pre - equilibrium charm production in both low-@xmath41 and high-@xmath41 region , with the largest increase in low-@xmath41 region .",

    "9 , the curve with diamonds shows the contribution from the fusion of soft gluons both with @xmath154 gev , and the curve with unfilled squares shows the contribution from the fusion of hard gluons both with @xmath155 gev .",
    "these two curves are both very low compared with the curve calculated from the soft+hard distribution .",
    "so the enhancement going from hard distribution to soft+hard distribution mainly comes from the fusion of hard and soft mini - jet gluons .",
    "we have noted before that our fit for the mini - jet gluon spectrum falls below the monte carlo result from hijing calculation .",
    "we can fit the soft gluons from hijing better by using @xmath156 for @xmath157 gev , and use the old fit @xmath158 for higher-@xmath41 gluons .",
    "this new fit gives us more very soft gluons .",
    "we have done the calculation for minimally - correlated case using the new fit , and the result is different only by less than 10% , which means the super - soft gluons are not very important for the pre - equilibrium charm production .",
    "there is also a possible cross - term contribution from the interactions of the incoming nuclei and the pre - equilibrium gluon mini - jets .",
    "however , our preliminary result shows that it is not larger than the above pre - equilibrium charm yield and is therefore also negligible compared with the initial charm production .      to understand the reason why the pre - equilibrium charm yield is so small compared to the initial yield as found through tedious numerical calculations in the previous section , we consider here the calculation of the total number of pre - equilibrium charm pairs .",
    "the expression for that number is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the integrated cross section for the process @xmath161 , see equation([eq : ggfusion ] ) .",
    "our main strategy is to estimate the mean difference between the two gluon rapidities , then from the kinematical constraint on charm production ( @xmath162 ) estimate the effective lower cutoff for @xmath41 of the mini - jet gluons .",

    "now let @xmath192 , then the last 3-dimensional integral in equation([eq : nmin ] ) without the factor @xmath193 is @xmath194 ^2 u^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath195-integral gives a dependence on @xmath196 which is similar to the logarithmic dependence in the bjorken case , and the exponential form in the integrand forces the spread @xmath197 to be small .",
    "numerically , by taking @xmath198 , @xmath199 gev ( as the first - step value ) in the @xmath195-integral , the above 3-dimensional integral is @xmath200 , and when the integrand is weighed by @xmath201 , the integral is @xmath202 .",
    "so @xmath203 note that the above determined value of @xmath169 is insensitive to the first - step @xmath169 value we tried in the @xmath195-integral .",
    "therefore for the total pre - equilibrium charm number , @xmath204   \\sim 0.10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore @xmath205 . from the above estimate we can see that although the minimally - correlated case allows particles with different rapidities to interact , the dominant contribution still comes from the region where the two gluons have almost the same rapidity , thus there is no sizeable enhancement in the pre - equilibrium charm yield .",
    "the minimally - correlated case is very much like the bjorken case in that the dominant contribution comes from @xmath206 region .    as a comparison to the above rough estimates in this section ,",
    "the numerical integration gives @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 , so @xmath210 .",
    "in this paper , we calculated initial and pre - equilibrium charm production in nuclear collisions to test the sensitivity of this probe to the unknown initial conditions in such reactions .",
    "for the initial charm production , the sensitive dependence on the choice of structure functions , the @xmath8 scale , and the k - factor was noted .",
    "the parameters were fixed by fitting the limited available experimental data at lower energies . we emphasized the need for new measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath50 charm production to reduce the present large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we argued that the copious charm production predicted in ref.@xcite was mainly due to the neglect of the coherent suppression of flavor excitation processes .",
    "our calculated initial charm yields are close to those computed in ref.@xcite and to the curve 2 in fig .  2 from ref.@xcite .    for the contribution from pre - equilibrium charm production , we studied the effect of correlations between the rapidity @xmath1 and space - time rapidity @xmath2 of mini - jet gluons . for the ideal bjorken - correlated case , where @xmath211 , the pre - equilibrium charm production is negligible compared with the yield due to initial gluon fusion . for the opposite extreme fireball case ,",
    "corresponding to uncorrelated @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the pre - equilibrium charm production is almost a factor of 50 larger than in the bjorken - correlated case and is comparable with the initial charm yield@xcite . by the estimates of the total pre - equilibrium charm number",
    ", we found the the difference mainly comes from the @xmath106 correlation .",
    "therefore , the pre - equilibrium charm production is very sensitive to the @xmath212 correlations in the initial state .    in order to investigate the effect of more realistic correlations that may exist in the initial mini - jet plasma",
    ", we introduced a minimal correlation model taking into account the uncertainty principle along the lines of ref.@xcite .",
    "our main result is that this minimal correlation is similar to the ideal bjorken correlation case and produces negligible pre - equilibrium charm compared with the initial charm yield .",
    "we also found that the pre - equilibrium charm yield is rather insensitive to the formation physics because the early - formed @xmath213 gev gluons dominate .",
