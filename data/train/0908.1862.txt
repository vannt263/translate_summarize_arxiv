    "goresky and macpherson proved the main theorem of stratified morse theory that local morse data is given as the product of the tangential and normal morse data in @xcite and have given beautiful applications of stratified morse theory to intersection cohomology and to the topology of complement of affine subspaces arrangements .",
    "many examples of singular stratified spaces are provided by complex analytic varieties , in which case the stratified morse theory behaves much better .",
    "for example , goresky and macpherson showed that the normal morse data of a point in the stratum is determined by the complex link up to homotopy equivalence .",
    "also in @xcite they showed that a critical point of a morse function of a ( stratified ) complex analytic variety can be given an index , in the sense that the intersection homology of the morse data is shown to be non - vanishing only in one index ( theorem i.1.6 @xcite ) . in the case of smooth manifolds , the morse index of a critical point is given as the dimension of the unstable manifold of the negative gradient flow .",
    "but in the ( stratified ) case of complex analytic varieties , it has not been known whether the index given from the intersection homology can be interpreted as the dimension of the unstable ( stratified ) manifold or not .",
    "in fact , goresky and macpherson conjectured the existence of a gradient - like vector field whose dimension of unstable ( stratified ) manifold is related to the above index ( @xcite p 213 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide the construction of this conjectural gradient - like vector field for morse functions obtained from complex analytic functions .",

    "more precisely , a point @xmath3 in a stratum @xmath4 is critical for a function @xmath0 if the restriction @xmath22 has a critical point at @xmath3 , and it is a non - degenerate critical point if it is non - degenerate both in the tangential and normal direction .",

    "a morse - smale - witten homology is constructed and showed to be isomorphic to singular homology .",
    "however a generic morse function does not define a morse pair : consider a stratified space @xmath7 which is given by two 2-spheres glued at a single point , say @xmath3 , which we regard as a singular stratum .",
    "then , a function @xmath0 on @xmath102 gives rise to a morse pair only if @xmath0 has a local minimum at the singular stratum @xmath3 . and",

    "this can be checked by considering carefully l s inductive procedure ( section 5.3 ) constructing @xmath197 .",
    "the estimate is clearly true for @xmath380 .",
    "we remind that the vanishing polyhedron is constructed in section 5.3 by gluing the polyhedron @xmath349 , obtained by flowing ( via @xmath330 ) the vanishing polyhedron @xmath326 to @xmath318 , where by induction we may assume that @xmath326 and @xmath506 satisfy the estimates ( [ dimest1 ] ) . here",
    "the flow @xmath330 is stratum - preserving as it is the sum of a controlled vector field ( @xmath507 ) and a weakly lipschitz vector field @xmath339 . as a consequence ,",
    "the dimensional estimate ( [ dimest1 ] ) continues to hold throughout the construction of @xmath197 .",
    "now , we begin the second step of the proof . as the argument",
    "above used only the contractibility of @xmath304 , we can in fact perform the same construction for a slightly larger set @xmath508 where @xmath509 is defined appropriately , and the vector field , which we call @xmath510 , over @xmath511 gives rise to a stable set at the critical point @xmath3 of the expected real dimension .",
    "also , we carry out a similar construction over the set @xmath512 with the vector field induced from @xmath388 on it .",
    "hence , the vector field , which we call @xmath513 , over @xmath514 gives rise to an unstable set of the expected real dimension at the critical point @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath515 , and also @xmath516 does not contain @xmath353 .",
    "now , we glue the two fields @xmath517 by means a partition of unity to obtain a stratified weakly lipschitz and controlled gradient - like vector field @xmath392 over @xmath518",
    ". we can use a partition of unity depending only on the angular parameter of @xmath177 . note that both the vector fields @xmath517 approaches zero as we approach the point @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the gluing is well - defined near @xmath29 .",
    "but the vector field @xmath392 , if we are to extend it continously over @xmath7 , must vanish on @xmath29 , hence @xmath392 can not be the gradient - like vector field over @xmath7 we are looking for ( as a gradient - like vector field is required to vanish only at critical points ) .    still , the new vector field @xmath392 projects down to @xmath388 by the map @xmath26 , and hence the stable and unstable set of @xmath3 exist only along @xmath353 .",
    "so the stable ( resp .",
    "unstable ) set of @xmath513 ( resp .",
    "@xmath510 ) remains as the stable ( resp .",
    "unstable ) set of the vector field @xmath392 at @xmath3 .    up to now",
    "we have a vector field @xmath392 defined in @xmath519 .",
    "it may or may not extend continuously over @xmath520 .",
    "hence , to solve this problem , we consider in addition , another vector field @xmath521 defined in the following way .",
    "as we consider gradient - like vector fields , it is clear that their unstable and stable set of @xmath3 do not intersect with @xmath29 except at @xmath3 .",
    "hence as they are closed sets , we may also assume that the neighborhood @xmath407 does not intersect both the unstable and stable sets of @xmath3 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) and does not intersect the polar curves .      as a consequence",
    ", @xmath524 is submersive .",
    "so we can take a controlled lift , with respect to some control system , of the vector field @xmath525 on @xmath526 , where @xmath527 denotes the standard coordinates in @xmath151 .",
    "the lift , which we denote by @xmath528 , is a stratified , controlled , gradient - like ( because of the compatibility with @xmath143 ) vector field .",
    "note that the flow of @xmath528 preserves the hyperplanes @xmath529 ( as it preserves the linear form @xmath222 ) , and does not vanish in @xmath407 . to make it continuous at @xmath3",
    ", we actually consider the vector field @xmath530 where @xmath396 is a distance function from @xmath3 in a fixed control system of @xmath7 and @xmath521 is still stratified , controlled ( except at @xmath3 ) and gradient - like .",
    "the open sets @xmath531 define an open cover of @xmath532 and , by using a partition of unity subordinate to this cover , we glue the vector field @xmath392 with @xmath521 , and denote the resulting vector field by @xmath13 . hence we get the continuous vector field @xmath13 on @xmath178 by defining @xmath533      indeed , first note that , as @xmath392 and @xmath521 are both stratified gradient - like vector fields , so is the vector field @xmath13 .",
    "it is also easy to check that @xmath13 does not vanish except at @xmath3 .",
    "it remains to show that the unstable and stable manifolds of @xmath13 satisfies the desired properties .",
    "we now consider the unstable and stable set of @xmath3 for the vector field @xmath13 .",
    "as we have glued away from the stable and unstable set at @xmath3 of the vector field @xmath392 , these remain as subsets of the stable and unstable set at @xmath3 of the vector field @xmath13 .",
    "hence it remains to show that in the intersection of two open sets @xmath534 we do not create any new gradient line converging to or emanating from @xmath3 by gluing .    to this purpose , we recall first that both vectors @xmath535 and @xmath536 are parallel to the @xmath96-axis of @xmath177 , hence the glued vector field @xmath13 also has such a property .",
    "for a possibly new flow trajectory converging to or emanating from @xmath3 , we only need to check what happens over @xmath353 , which is the @xmath96-axis .",
    "the vector field @xmath392 over @xmath353 is , by construction , the same as the vector fields @xmath517 on @xmath537 .",
    "now , recall that the vector field @xmath392 inside the set @xmath538 is a lift of @xmath388 for the map @xmath26 and is tangent to @xmath456 for some @xmath539 , hence the flow of @xmath392 preserves the sets @xmath456 for @xmath540 .    consider the polar curve @xmath149 and a linear form @xmath541 .",
    "this is a branch cover at @xmath3 , hence , as @xmath542 approaches @xmath250 , the image of the polar curve @xmath543 also approaches @xmath250 , thgerefore , we may assume that in a sufficiently close neighborhood of @xmath3 and for sufficiently large @xmath539 , the flow along @xmath456 decreases the value of @xmath544 .",
    "note however that the flow @xmath521 at a point of @xmath456 fixes @xmath544 , as it preserves the linear form , hence , the vector field @xmath521 at @xmath456 is pointing outward ( away from @xmath290 ) , toward @xmath545 for @xmath546 .",
    "as @xmath392 is tangent to @xmath456 and as @xmath521 is pointing outward to @xmath456 , the final vector field @xmath13 , which is obtained as a partition of unity of @xmath392 and @xmath13 , is also tangent to @xmath456 or pointing outward .",
    "the vector field @xmath13 is controlled except at @xmath3 .",
    "we can make it weakly controlled while preserving the trajectories of @xmath13 , as in the case of @xmath380 , by multiplying it with a function of @xmath396 which vanishes at @xmath250 .",
    "( here @xmath396 is the distance function to @xmath3 from the fixed control system ) .    as the unstable and stable set",
    "are given by @xmath547 , and we have already shown that they satisfy the dimensional estimate ( [ dimest1 ] ) after the construction of @xmath290 .",
    "this finishes the proof of the claim and this proves the main theorem .      to obtain a global vector field on @xmath7",
    ", we first apply the main theorem to each normal slice of critical points of @xmath0 .",
    "then , by adding a tangential component ( as in the smooth case ) to each normal slice , we obtain a vector field with the required properties in each neighborhood of critical points . for any point @xmath548 which is not a critical point , we choose a contractible neighorhood @xmath95 of @xmath549 which does not contain any critical point .",
    "then we consider a map @xmath550 , which is a submersion , and take a controlled lift of the standard unit vector field on @xmath116 .",
    "then , we obtain the global vector field by a partition of unity .              for a complex analytic variety",
    "the homotopy type of normal morse data is given by @xmath558 , where @xmath559 denotes the complex link of @xmath3 and @xmath560 the cone over @xmath559 ; but by definition @xmath559 is @xmath561 , which , by corollary [ mc ] , deformation retracts onto @xmath562 ; on the other hand , by construction , @xmath14 is the cone over @xmath563 .",
    "the normal morse data are homeomorphic to @xmath564 where @xmath565)/(q,0)\\cong(\\mu(q),2\\pi)]\\cup_{\\partial(x_t\\cap b(p))\\times s^1}[\\partial(x_t\\cap b(p))\\times d^1])\\ ] ] @xmath566\\ ] ] where @xmath567 is the monodromy associated to @xmath3 , @xmath568 is the map appearing in corollary [ mc ] and @xmath569 is embedded in the base of the cone .",
