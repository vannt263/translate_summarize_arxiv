    "and  bosons are produced at the tevatron proton - antiproton collider via quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "they quickly decay into two fermions which , due to the large mass of the bosons , typically have a high momentum in the direction transverse to the beam , .",
    "the  and  decay channels , where the charged lepton is an electron or muon , have clean experimental signatures and can therefore be utilized to make precision measurements of  and  properties and to probe the quantum - chromodynamic ( qcd ) aspects of their production mechanism .",
    "events are identified by the detection of two high  charged leptons ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "exchange or interference between them , where the invariant mass of the decay products is close to the  mass to maximize the contribution from pure  exchange . ] both electrons and muons are detected in the cdf and d  central trackers where their momenta are measured .",
    "muons tracks are also matched to tracks in the outer muon detectors .",
    "electrons are also detected in the calorimeters , where a measurement of their energy is made .",
    "events are identified by one high  charged lepton and one high  neutrino .",
    "again , the charged lepton is detected and its momentum measured , but the neutrino can not be detected .",
    "its existence is inferred by an imbalance in  in the detectors .",
    "the remainder of this document is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec - pdf ] describes how  and  events can place constraints on parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and presents cdf measurements of the  rapidity distribution and the  charge asymmetry .",
    "section  [ sec - zpt ] motivates and describes a d  measurement of the  distribution .",
    "section  [ sec - zasym ] presents a d  measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry and extraction of  and section  [ sec - width ] presents a precision measurement of the  width from cdf .",
    "all of the presented measurements have been corrected for detector acceptance and smearing affects and can be compared directly to theoretical predictions .",
    "pdfs are parameterized functional forms that describe the momentum distribution of partons in hadrons .",
    "the parameters are constrained by fits to many data sets from different experiments .",
    "the pdf sets used in these analyses are from global fits performed by the cteq and mrst groups .",
    "well constrained pdfs are essential for many measurements and searches at hadron colliders since they affect the simulated cross - sections and kinematic distributions of signal and background predictions from monte carlo event generators and theoretical calculations . at leading - order",
    "the  and  production cross - sections can be written as : @xmath2 \\times d\\sigma_{q\\bar{q}\\rightarrow w / z}dx_{p}dx_{\\bar{p}}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 gives the probability of a quark of flavor @xmath4 to be carrying a fraction @xmath5 of the proton s momentum ( this is the pdf for parton @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 give the pdfs for antiquarks in the antiproton , antiquarks in the proton and quarks in the antiproton respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the cross - section of the hard scatter for a given @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "differential measurements of the cross - sections with respect to any variables that depend on @xmath5 , @xmath10 or the parton flavor can therefore be used to constrain pdfs .      in  production @xmath5 and @xmath10",
    "are related to the rapidity of the  boson , , via the equations : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the center of mass energy and @xmath14 is the mass of the .",
    "thus a measurement of @xmath15 places constraints on the proton pdfs .",
    "in particular , the high @xmath16 region probes both the high and low @xmath17 regions of the pdfs , as can be deduced from equations  [ eq : zrapa ] and  [ eq : zrapb ] .",
    "cdf has made a measurement of @xmath15 using 2.1 fb@xmath18 of  data with @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zrap ] shows the measurement compared to a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation  @xcite using nlo cteq6.1 m  @xcite pdfs .",
    "good agreement is observed after scaling the normalization of the prediction to match the data .",
    "the uncertainties on the data points include both statistical and systematic uncertainties , but exclude an overall luminosity uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ fig : zrapratio ] shows the distribution of the data divided by the theory for ( a ) the nlo calculation with nlo cteq6.1 m pdfs and ( b ) a next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) calculation  @xcite using nnlo mrst 2006 pdfs  @xcite . only the statistical errors are included in these ratio plots as the systematics have large bin to bin correlations .",
    "the data are found to be most consistent with the nlo cteq6.1 m prediction .",
    "this result will help to constrain pdfs in future fits .",
    "on average the @xmath20 quark carries a higher fraction of the ( anti)proton s momentum than the @xmath21 quark , meaning that a @xmath22 produced via @xmath23 annihilation will tend to be boosted in the direction of the ( anti)proton beam .",
    "this results in a  charge asymmetry , defined as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rapidity of the  and @xmath26 are the cross - sections for @xmath27 production .",
    "this distribution is sensitive to the ratio of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 pdfs at the scale @xmath30 and is an important input to the global pdf fits .",
    "since the neutrino momentum in the direction of the beam , @xmath31 , is not known , a measurement of the electron or muon charge asymmetry , as opposed to @xmath32 , has traditionally been made .",
    "this distribution is a convolution of @xmath32 and the  angular decay structure .",
    "the fact that the  only couples to left(right ) handed ( anti)particles favors decay to a forward(backward ) @xmath33 .",
    "this dilutes the effect of the production asymmetry and reduces the constraint on the @xmath34 ratio provided by the measurement .",
    "the cdf analysis extracts @xmath32 by constraining @xmath35 , giving two possible solutions for @xmath31 .",
    "each solution receives a probability weight according to the decay structure and @xmath26 .",
    "the  charge asymmetry is then extracted after correcting for detector effects .",
    "the process is iterated to reduce the dependence of the weighting factor on the asymmetry itself .",
    "the measured  charge asymmetry is compared to the prediction from pdfs using ( a ) nlo cteq6.1 m  @xcite and ( b ) nnlo mrst 2006  @xcite in figure  [ fig : wasym ] .",
    "the data are most consistent with the nlo cteq6.1 m prediction .",
    "the pdf uncertainties from the respective groups are shown with shaded bands .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are smaller than the uncertainties from the pdfs indicating that this measurement will help to constrain pdfs in future fits .",
    "at leading - order  bosons are produced with zero  because the annihilating quarks are moving in the direction of the incoming ( anti)protons .",
    "higher order qcd corrections lead to parton radiation from the incoming quarks which give the  a non - zero .",
    "therefore a measurement of the  ( ) distribution provides a stringent test of qcd predictions and can be used to tune and validate monte carlo event generators . at large  ( greater than about ) the radiation of a single ( or double )",
    "parton dominates the cross - section and fixed order perturbative qcd calculations should yield reliable results . at lower  multiple",
    "soft parton radiation dominates and resummation techniques or parton shower monte carlo event generators combined with non - perturbative models are required to give reliable predictions .",
    "d  have published a measurement of the normalized differential cross - section as a function of   using @xmath36 of  data with @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : zpt ] shows the result to be in good agreement with the prediction from the resbos  @xcite event generator in the region  @xmath38 30  gev / c .",
    "resbos incorporates a nlo perturbative qcd calculation at high  with the collins , soper and sterman ( css )  @xcite resummation formalism in impact parameter space using the brock , landry , nadolsky and yuan ( bnly )  @xcite non - perturbative function .",
    "recent studies from deep inelastic scattering experiments  @xcite indicate that the resummation calculation may need to be modified for  bosons produced with a small-@xmath17 parton .",
    "the  distribution is expected to broaden in the small-@xmath17 ( high @xmath39@xmath39 ) region which has important implications for modeling vector boson and higgs production at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : zptlowx ] shows the  distribution for events with @xmath39@xmath40 2 compared to resbos with and without the modified calculation .",
    "a better description is currently obtained from resbos without the modified calculation , although it remains to be seen whether a re - tuning of the non - perturbative parameters could improve the agreement .",
    "figure  [ fig : zptwide ] shows the measured  distribution in the region  @xmath38 260  gev / c compared to resbos , resbos with a nlo to nnlo k - factor provided by  @xcite , a nnlo perturbative calculation  @xcite divided by a nnlo calculation of the total cross - section  @xcite and the nnlo calculation rescaled to match the data at  = 30  gev / c .",
    "figure  [ fig : zptwide - ratio ] shows the data minus theory , divided by theory distributions for the above predictions . in the large  region",
    "resbos under - estimates the cross - section . applying the nlo to nnlo k - factor",
    "improves the prediction but the best agreement in the region is achieved when the prediction is rescaled by a factor of 1.25 to match the data at this indicates that the shape of the distribution is well modeled but the source of the discrepancy is in the normalization .",
    "the  couplings to fermions have both vector and axial - vector components . the angular decay structure from vector couplings",
    "has the form @xmath41 and that from axial - vector couplings has the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the angle between the outgoing negatively charged lepton and the incoming quark in the rest frame of the lepton pair .",
    "the axial - vector contribution gives rise to a forward - backward asymmetry defined as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the forward cross - section ( for events with cos@xmath46 ) and @xmath47 is the backward cross - section ( for events with cos@xmath48 ) .",
    "since  depends on the relative size of the vector and axial - vector couplings it is sensitive to  where @xmath49 is the effective weak mixing angle .",
    "varies with the di - lepton invariant mass , @xmath50 , as the relative contributions from the exchange of , @xmath51 and the interference terms vary .",
    "a measurement of  as a function of @xmath50 can be used to extract .",
    "d  has published a measurement of  using 1.1 fb@xmath18 of  data with @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : afb ] shows the unfolded  as a function of the di - electron invariant mass compared to standard model predictions from the pythia  @xcite and zgrad2  @xcite event generators .",
    "the data are in good agreement with the standard model prediction .",
    "it should be noted that significant deviations from the standard model in the high mass region could signify the existence of a new massive neutral gauge boson .",
    "a fit to the  distribution yields a measurement of , which is in good agreement with previous measurements  @xcite .",
    "the  width is known within the standard model to an extremely high precision of 0.1% , thus an accurate experimental measurement is desirable to test this prediction .",
    "cdf has published a measurement of  using 350  pb@xmath18 of  and  data  @xcite .",
    "since neutrinos are not detected in cdf , the invariant mass of the  decay products can not be reconstructed . instead we measure  by reconstructing the transverse mass , which is defined as @xmath53 , where  and @xmath54 are the  of the charged lepton and the neutrino respectively and @xmath55 is the azimuthal angle between them .",
    "@xmath54 is inferred from the transverse momentum imbalance in the event .",
    "a fast , parameterized monte carlo simulation is used to predict the  distribution as a function of . after adding background distributions to the monte carlo ,",
    "a binned maximum - likelihood fit to the data is performed in the region 90  @xmath38  @xmath38  200  gev/@xmath56 to extract .",
    "the fit is performed in the high  tail region because it is still sensitive to the breit - wigner line - shape but less sensitive to the gaussian detector resolutions than the peak region .",
    "these line - shape predictions depend on a number of production and detector effects that must be accurately modeled .",
    "figure  [ fig : width - fits ] shows the  fits for  in ( a )  and ( b )  events .",
    "the results are combined to give the final result  = 2032 @xmath57 73  mev , the world s most precise measurement , which is in good agreement with the standard model prediction of 2090.2 @xmath57 0.9  mev  @xcite .",
