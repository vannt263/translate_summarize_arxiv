    "among all the stellar properties , the characteristics of solar - like stars winds are probably the most difficult to probe",
    ". emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum unveil some of the properties of the photosphere and the coronae of stars , and internal structures can be probed with asteroseismology .",
    "winds , on the contrary , produce very few detectable signals , although they are likely to exist in all stars possessing a hot corona , as supersonic outflows are the only stable way to balance coronal pressure with the near zero interstellar medium pressure @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that absorption by neutral hydrogen at the astropause could be detected in ly@xmath2 spectra around astrospheres of nearby solar - like stars , unravelling properties of the stellar wind shocking against the interstellar medium .",
    "a growing sample of solar - type stars with positive detection for stellar winds led to relationship between x - ray fluxes originating from coronal loops and mass loss rates @xcite .",
    "the  strength \" of stellar winds , the mass loss rate @xmath3 , has consequently been related to the magnetic activity of the star . @xcite",
    "have obtained the relation : @xmath4 , for @xmath5 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the x - ray flux . beyond this value , weaker mass loss rates",
    "are observed , suggesting a saturation effect , that is below the usual @xmath8 saturation value @xcite .    in parallel ,",
    "the development of zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi ) @xcite , has opened the study of surface magnetic fields for cool stars .",
    "large scale magnetic fields have been detected in the whole mass range that is thought to correspond to the existence of a convective envelope ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the study of the geometrical and topological properties of the field in the context of stellar evolution is still in progress @xcite , and raises theoretical questions about their generation through dynamo processes in convective envelopes ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , the magnetic field amplitude of these stars has been shown to be a growing function of the rotation rate @xcite .",
    "this is necessary to explain the rotational braking of cool main sequence dwarfs , as evolutionary models need the wind to carry angular momentum at a rate proportional to @xmath0 @xcite all along the main sequence .",
    "however , recent studies suggest that the wind braking could stop or strongly decay for evolved stars , around a solar rossby number @xmath10 @xcite , perhaps because of a change in magnetic topology @xcite .",
    "hence wind , magnetism , and rotation are likely to evolve coherently through the whole life of solar - like stars .",
    "after @xcite understood that a magnetized outflow would carry away stellar angular momentum , @xcite demonstrated that this loss is proportional to the alfvn radius squared .",
    "several studies have followed to try to estimate the alfvn radius from stellar parameters and thus give scaling laws for the angular momentum loss @xcite .",
    "the latest braking laws have been successfully introduced in stellar evolution models @xcite , and we recently demonstrated that the magnetic topology could be included in those formulations through a simple scalar parameter , the open magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "most studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been made in two dimensions with axisymmetric configurations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a 3d study of angular momentum loss with idealized magnetic field topologies ) , and were not able to capture the structure of complex magnetic fields observed by zdi .",
    "3d mhd simulations are now taking into account this complexity @xcite , to derive a self - consistent coronal structure .",
    "the complex structure of the corona is needed to study the interaction between stars and close - in planets which have been shown to be very sensitive to 3d effects @xcite . yet , to our knowledge , the influence of realistic magnetic fields on the long time variation of the wind properties has not been studied .    this work proposes to include observed , realistic magnetic fields in the context of stellar evolution .",
    "we used spectropolarimetric observations of the surface fields of solar - like stars to constrain 3d mhd simulations of stellar winds .",
    "the stars of our sample share similar properties except their rotational periods and their ages that range from 25 myr to 4.5 gyr .",
    "we developed a coherent framework to take into account the evolution of the coronal properties with time , inspired by x - ray flux observations , spin evolution models and theoretical , _ ab - initio _ models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we confirm that the evolution with age of global properties of the wind such as the mass and angular momentum loss follows simple prescriptions in agreement with the spin evolution models .",
    "these prescriptions can be recovered by the semi - analytical model we developped in @xcite , except for the saturation of angular momentum that appears only in our simulations .",
    "also , the three dimensional structure of the young stars winds , shows interesting features such as a trimodal speed distribution , that we explain through various interactions with the intense magnetic field .",
    "we show that superradial expansion is a key factor to explain the fastest wind components of young stars wind .",
    "we also observe regions of fast wind encountering slower streams in the equatorial plane , the so - called co - rotating interactions regions ( cirs ) , that could be more common in the wind of young stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the ingredients of our model are described throughout section [ sec : model ] . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : zdi ] , we describe the observations used to constrain the surface magnetic fields of our simulations .",
    "subsection [ subsec : evol ] describes our prescriptions for the coronal properties and subsection [ subsec : num ] our numerical setup .",
    "the results are presented in two parts , section [ sec : glob ] where we look at global properties such as the angular momentum and mass loss over time , and section [ sec : vel ] where the tridimensional structure of the wind is detailed , with a special focus on the velocity distribution .",
    "we summarize and reflect upon our findings in section [ sec : ccl ] .",

    "the direction of the field ( and thus the flow ) seems different for the fast stream than for the slow stream and a compression region occur .",
    "figure [ cir ] shows the profiles of the density , the mach number , the magnetic field and the current density amplitude along a @xmath46 radius circle in the equatorial plane of bd- 16351 .",
    "two density peaks mark the slow wind components .",
    "these peaks correspond to troughs in the profiles of the mach number and the magnetic field amplitude .",
    "the thin throat in the magnetic field profile matches the crossing of the current sheet that also correspond to slow wind components .",
    "this structure is similar to the heliospheric current sheet , except fot its inclination that follows the strongly inclied dipole of bd- 16351 .     equatorial circle in the bd- 16351 case .",
    "peaks of density associated with trough of velocity mark the slow wind component . compression and acceleration occur when the fast wind encounter the slow wind component . ]",
    "it is interesting to look at what happens to the flow just ahead of a density peak",
    ". the magnetic field is increasing , which means that a compression in the flow occur .",
    "however , if the density increases at first , it decreases before the peak , compensated by an acceleration of the flow . in these regions the wind reaches its maximum mach number , just below 5 , that are shown in red in figure [ eqplane ] .",
    "the velocity then drops rapidly inside the streamer , where higher ( by a factor of 2 to 5 ) densities are achieved .",
    "this structure is repeated with the second streamer , beyond @xmath47 .",
    "nonetheless , the shock conditions are not yet fulfilled ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the solution would likely require to extend in a larger domain to produce shocks . in our simulations",
    "the discontinuities are separated by a contact layer with no matter exchanged between them . from a numerical point of view , the hlle solver that we use is one of the most diffusive approximate riemann solver and may not be able to correctly capture such an oblique shock .",
    "it is likely though that shocks will form much earlier in the case of fast rotators , simply because of the enhanced helicity of the parker spiral , thus changing the energetic budget in the astrospheres of young suns .",
    "cirs in the solar system are thought to be the most frequent cause for geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "our solar case does not show such features , because we lack an additional heating mechanism for the acceleration of the fast wind .",
    "yet , we can extrapolate our results stating that younger stars are likely to create more cirs that shock in the interplanetary medium , adding up to other dynamical events that are thought to be enhanced in the environment of active stars , such as flares and cmes @xcite .",
    "our study addresses 3d simulations constrained by spectropolarimetric observations of magnetic fields in the context of stellar evolution , along the main sequence .",
    "our findings can be divided in two parts .",
    "first , considering global and integrated properties , the mass and angular momentum loss follow simple prescriptions thanks to an appropriate modeling of the evolution of the temperature and the coronal density with the rotation rate . an angular momentum proportional to the @xmath0",
    "can be obtained using our prescriptions with observed magnetic field amplitudes , which is required to observe convergence of spin rates on the skumanich law .",
    "our 3d simulations follow the braking law we derived in @xcite , if the @xmath48 constant is reduced by @xmath49 .",
    "this can be understood because our simulations are made with a larger ( and different for each case ) coronal temperature compared to this previous work .",
    "hence , the wind described is here faster , and for a given magnetic field strength , the alfvn radius is closer to the star .",
    "however the fit shows little deviation and one constant @xmath48 in the scaling law is able to describe the whole range of temperature of our sample .",
    "a more general braking law should quantify the influence of the temperature on @xmath48 , since the variation remain limited in this study .",
    "also , the use of a fully 3d geometry could be involved in the variation of @xmath48 .",
    "nonetheless , because this formulation expresses the dependence of the alfvn radius on a magnetization parameter that includes the thermodynamics of the wind , it is likely to be valid for a wide range of magnetic fields , rotation rates , coronal temperatures and densities , if one allows a small dependence of @xmath48 on the temperature .    with this adapted formulation , the semi - analytical we developed in @xcite can be applied .",
    "the estimation method of the open flux of the simulation with a potential extrapolation that was tested on 2.5d configurations is perfectly operational with 3d non - axisymmetric fields .",
    "our semi - analytical model is consequently able to estimate closely the evolution of angular momentum with the rotational period , as long as the mass loss rate of the simulations does not deviate too much from the spherically symmetric value used the semi - analytical model .",
    "this deviation grows as the stars rotate faster and possess more intense magnetic fields .",
    "large coronal loops are able to confine more plasma , and the mass loss seems to plateau for @xmath50 .",
    "this behaviour has consequences on the angular momentum loss that shows signs of saturation beyond this rotation rate , whose value is coherent with the saturation value used in rotation evolution models for k - type stars @xcite . although the saturation of angular momentum loss is often associated with the saturation observed in the x - ray fluxes , the precise process behind this saturation remains unknown .",
    "some works have suggested a stochastic change of the dynamo process generating the magnetic field could be involved in a topology switch from small scales to large scales that turn on the @xmath0 braking law @xcite .",
    "however , no such transition is observed in our sample , as all our stars possess a strong dipolar field . in our simulations",
    ", the aml saturation seems to be due to the confinement of the outflow in large coronal loops that reduces the mass loss , which can be associated with the dependance of the wind braking on the filling factor ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results need , however , to be confirmed by more simulations of fast rotators and are likely to be highly dependent on the prescriptions we used for the coronal base densities and temperature .    the mass loss rate of young stars in our study ,",
    "although up to @xmath51 to @xmath52 times the solar one , , we have considered an upper value of the solar mass loss rate @xmath53yr . ]",
    "does not reach the highest values derived in @xcite .",
    "a much higher dependence on rotation , for either the temperature or the coronal density would have been necessary to observe @xmath54 values in our simulations .",
    "our semi analytical model could be used to study the influence of different prescriptions on the variation of @xmath55 .",
    "change in the exponents of the evolution laws , or the solar initial values , could be tested . a more physical description of the stellar wind acceleration , driven for example by alfvn waves turbulence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can help to understand how coronal parameters evolve with age .",
    "future works will be dedicated to include such processes in our simulations .    to solve this issue ,",
    "more observations are also critical . in the work of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the analysis of the ly@xmath2 absorption spectra is coupled with numerical simulations of the terminal shock , where the wind speed is kept constant at the slow solar wind value around @xmath56 km / s .",
    "our study , and this is the second part of our findings , brings more accurate constraints on the wind velocities amplitude and distribution for solar - like stars that could be used to improve those calculations .",
    "indeed , several studies have now shown that the wind speeds are likely to increase for young stars , mostly because of higher coronal temperature and magneto - centrifugal acceleration @xcite .",
    "we show that the speed distribution of young and active stars follow a trimodal structure due to the interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , the one - dimensional magneto - centrifugal wind solution @xcite is at best a low estimate of the fastest component of the wind , as other magnetic processes are able to accelerate the wind .",
    "for instance , we observe in our simulations fast streams in the vicinity of the star caused by latitudinal or longitudinal superradial expansion of flux tube due to the fast rotation and the non - axisymmetry of the magnetic field .    as slow and fast wind",
    "exist around solar - like stars , they can interact in the equatorial plane , creating co - rotating interaction regions , that could be more common for younger stars and be forming shocks closer to the star ( the usual distance observed in the solar system is between @xmath34 and @xmath17 au ) .",
    "this could have consequences on the energetics of expanding stellar winds of young stars and on exoplanetary space weather .",
    "the current sheet of young stars is also strongly corrugated when the dipole is inclined and polarity variation occur closer to one another , which has important consequences on the interaction with close - in planets , especially when they are within the alfvn surface @xcite .",
    "this is , however , a very preliminary study and a more focused work needs to be done in that sense , improving for instance the numerical scheme and shock absorbing method .",

    "the mass conservation within a flux tube reduces to the equation :                when the wind is subsonic ( @xmath65 ) , the term @xmath66 is negative , and thus what matters for the acceleration of the wind is the sign of the right hand side term .",

    "the spherically symmetric solution , that corresponds to the case @xmath69 , and @xmath70 gives      as the parker solution is always accelerating .",
    "it is shown that supperradial expansion is globally anti - correlated with the wind speed @xcite , because of the local inversion of the latter inequality below the sonic surface .",
    "nonetheless , superradial expansion can accelerate the outflow as long as @xmath72 remains smaller than @xmath73 , for instance if the superradial expansion is located near the surface or well below the sonic point ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the supersonic regime , a superradial expansion will necessarily accelerate the outflow .",
    "indeed , as @xmath74 , and since the right hand side is positive in the radial case , any superradial expansion will grow this term , and @xmath75 will be larger .",
    "the treatment of this problem without the isothermal approximation is much more complex . in our study",
    ", the sound speed variation may not be negligible , but the qualitative behavior remains and a quantitative analysis is left for future works ."

    "<S> we observe a complex wind speed distribution for the youngest stars with slow , intermediate and fast wind components , which are the result of the interaction with intense and non axisymmetric magnetic fields . </S>",
