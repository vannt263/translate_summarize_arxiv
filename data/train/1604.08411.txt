    "we investigate the strength of ultraviolet fe  ii emission for fainter quasars compared with brighter quasars for the redshift interval @xmath7 .",
    "we consider both quasars in general and the subset that are members of large quasar groups ( lqgs ) .",
    "we use the dr7qso catalogue and spectra @xcite of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to make comparisons of fainter and brighter quasars within the limit @xmath8 of the low - redshift strand of quasar selection @xcite for the sdss .",
    "we extend the faint limit of the comparisons to @xmath9 using the sdss faint quasar survey ( sfqs ) of @xcite , which actually reaches @xmath10 .",
    "the use of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 in what follows arises from the specifications of these published quasar samples .",
    "the investigation is a continuation of the work presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter clo13b ) .",
    "that paper found , for a large sample of lqg members ( @xmath8 , @xmath13 ) , a shift in the @xmath1 equivalent width @xcite of @xmath14    ( @xmath15   ) compared with a matched control sample of non - members .",
    "it also found a tentative indication that the shift in @xmath1 increased to fainter @xmath12 magnitudes ( @xmath16    for @xmath17 ) .",
    "furthermore , the strongest @xmath1 emitters within the lqgs had preferred nearest - neighbour separations of @xmath18  3050  mpc ( present epoch ) to the adjacent quasar of any @xmath1 strength , with no such effect being seen for quasars outside lqgs .",
    "the further investigation of the dependences of the uv fe  ii on intrinsic luminosity and on environment ( lqg or non - lqg ) has some potential to improve our understanding both of the causes of strong and ultrastrong uv fe  ii emission in quasars and of the nature of lqgs .    in this paper",
    ", we use the dr7qso catalogue and spectra @xcite and the sfqs catalogue and spectra @xcite to investigate the uv fe  ii properties of fainter quasars relative to brighter quasars .",
    "we also make some use of our own , rather smaller , data sets . we find a universal dependence ( i.e.  for quasars in general ) of the @xmath1 equivalent width on the intrinsic continuum luminosity , such that @xmath1 is greater for fainter quasars .",
    "we find a further , differential , dependence , in the same sense , for quasars that are members of lqgs .",
    "we avoid calling either of these effects `` a baldwin effect '' @xcite because there appear to be differences compared with the standard perception of the baldwin effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find also that @xmath1 increases as the fwhm of the mg  ii @xmath4 broad emission line decreases .",
    "we suggest an explanation for these universal and differential dependences of @xmath1 on luminosity , and consider the implications for the possible nature of lqgs .",
    "the concordance model is adopted for cosmological calculations , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22  kms@xmath23mpc@xmath23 .",
    "all sizes given are proper sizes at the present epoch . later in the paper",
    "we incorporate estimates of black hole masses from @xcite ; their adopted cosmological parameters differed a little , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .      for a comprehensive discussion of lqgs , see @xcite and @xcite , together with the earlier references given in those papers .",
    "essentially , lqgs are large structures  that is , large - scale overdensities , usually at some specified amplitude  of quasars , seen in the early universe .",
    "they have sizes @xmath18  70500 mpc and memberships of @xmath18  570 quasars .    our catalogue of lqgs ( clowes , in preparation ) was obtained from dr7qso quasars with @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "it was used by @xcite , @xcite , and clo13b , and descriptions of the selection of the lqgs can be found in those papers .",
    "the uv fe  ii problem in quasars and seyfert galaxies has been known for more than thirty years  see @xcite and @xcite , and references given in those papers , for some initial discussions of the observational and theoretical aspects . essentially , the problem is that the uv fe  ii emission can vary greatly in strength from one quasar to another , and the variation appears not to simply correspond to iron abundance .",
    "of particular interest are the rare `` ultrastrong emitters '' , a good example of which is the quasar 2226@xmath263905 @xcite .",
    "they represent only @xmath18  6.6 per cent of all quasars in the redshift range @xmath27 and with @xmath8 ( clo13b ) . also of particular interest",
    "is the ratio of the uv fe  ii flux to that of the nearby mg   ii  @xmath282798 doublet , fe  ii(uv)/mg  ii , because of its potential to allow deduction of the abundance ratio fe/@xmath5 , where @xmath5 refers to the @xmath5-elements o ,  ne ,  mg ,  etc .",
    "the fe is generally thought to be produced on timescales @xmath18  1  gyr by sne  ia and the @xmath5-elements on shorter timescales by sne  ii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measurement of the abundance ratio in quasars could then conceivably allow deductions about the time of major star formation relative to the time of quasar activity  an `` iron - clock '' .",
    "however , aside from the question of the extent to which the ratio fe  ii(uv)/mg  ii relates to the abundance ratio ( see below ) , the observations show that it is essentially constant for redshifts @xmath29 and that star formation therefore appears to precede quasar activity by perhaps 0.3  gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note , however , that @xcite present an abundance analysis for a particular ( if unusual ) quasar that does not support this notion of an iron - clock .",
    "furthermore , calculations by @xcite show that the timescale for the maximum rate of sne  ia , and hence for the maximum rate of enrichment , depends strongly on the adopted conditions ( stellar lifetimes , initial mass function , star - formation rate ) , being @xmath18  4050  myr for an instantaneous starburst , @xmath18  0.3  gyr for a typical elliptical galaxy , and @xmath18  45  gyr for the disk of a milky - way - type galaxy .",
    "an instantaneous starburst seems plausible for the central activity of a galaxy that precedes the quasar activity .",
    "@xcite emphasise that the commonly - used timescale of @xmath18  1  gyr is the timescale at which the production of iron begins to become important for the solar neighbourhood : it is not the time at which sne  ia begin to occur .",
    "note that the progenitors of sne  ia have not yet been established observationally @xcite , although observations can constrain the possibilities for models and abundance yields .    also , @xcite found evidence that fe  ii(uv)/mg  ii , for @xmath30 , increases across the interval @xmath31  1.82.2 , relative to its value at lower redshifts .",
    "they interpret this result mainly as a dependence on intrinsic luminosity ( ionising flux ) rather than on abundance .",
    "accounting for the strength of the uv fe  ii emission and its variation between quasars is a complicated problem , with many contributing factors such as iron abundance , hydrogen density , hydrogen column density , temperature , ionisation flux ( excitation flux , continuum shape ) , microturbulence , ly@xmath5 fluorescence , and spatial distribution of the emitting gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quasars with ultrastrong emission , being extreme , may be particularly useful for clarifying the relative importance of different factors .",
    "the current view is that probably iron abundance , ly@xmath5 fluorescence , and microturbulence are all contributing significantly to the ultrastrong emission .",
    "the most detailed modelling of fe  ii emission is by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they consider 830 energy levels of the fe@xmath32 ion , corresponding to 344035 transitions .",
    "@xcite conclude that iron abundance is not the only factor that can lead to strong emission and , moreover , that it is not even likely to be the dominant factor .",
    "@xcite discuss the relative importance of abundance and microturbulence , showing that increasing the iron abundance from solar to five times solar increases the flux ratio fe   ii(uv)/mg  ii by less than a factor of two .",
    "conversely , increasing the microturbulence from 5  km  s@xmath23 to 25  km  s@xmath23 increases the ratio fe  ii(uv)/mg  ii by more than a factor of two .",
    "( @xcite considered the effect of microturbulence on h@xmath33 emission and found that it increased emission across the whole blr , but especially at the smaller radii . )",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that the most reasonable value for the microturbulence is 510  km  s@xmath23 , while @xcite favour 20  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "@xcite suggest 100  km  s@xmath23 as that would produce smooth line profiles . @xcite and @xcite also recognised that abundance is important but unlikely to be dominant .",
    "early in the history of the fe  ii problem , @xcite and @xcite concluded that either there was an unusually high abundance of iron or an important mechanism was being overlooked .",
    "microturbulence is one such mechanism since it increases the spread in wavelength of fe  ii absorption and thus increases radiative pumping .",
    "earlier than the discussions of microturbulence however , @xcite had proposed that ly@xmath5 fluorescence might be the overlooked mechanism .",
    "this possibility received observational and theoretical support from @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "ly@xmath5 fluorescence of fe  ii is discussed in detail by @xcite for cool stars and by @xcite for the symbiotic star rr  tel .",
    "these papers , and especially @xcite , also discuss fluorescence arising from other emission lines , such as c   iv @xmath281548 .",
    "@xcite discuss the significance of the peculiar atomic structure of the fe@xmath32 ion .",
    "the 63 lowest energy levels , up to 4.77  ev , are all of even parity , with no permitted transitions between them .",
    "these energy levels will be well populated , with the electrons consequently available for pumping to higher levels by the 10.2  ev ly@xmath5 line ( and also by the continuum ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss ly@xmath5 fluorescence in connection with stars , but the mechanism is , of course , equally relevant to quasars .",
    "however , the width of ly@xmath5 is much larger in quasars than in the stars .",
    "the most important excitation channels are within @xmath34    of ly@xmath5 , as discussed by @xcite . for",
    "the broad lines of quasars , @xcite consider the excitation channels within @xmath35   , finding an increase of @xmath18  15 per cent in the ratio fe   ii(uv)/h@xmath33 compared with that for @xmath36    ( with zero microturbulence in both cases ) .",
    "we discuss briefly below ( section  [ subsecblr ] ) that a particular small emitting region or cloudlet will see the full profile of the ly@xmath5 arising from the whole ensemble of cloudlets in the broad line region . for quasars",
    ", the central concentration of the ly@xmath5 flux thus seems likely to be important , to emphasise the important @xmath36   .",
    "we might expect that , for quasars , the ratio of fwhm to equivalent width of the ly@xmath5 would be a useful central - concentration parameter for associating with the fe  ii emission ( with low fwhm / ew implying a high central - concentration ) .    in this context of ly@xmath5 fluorescence ,",
    "an interesting case is apparent in @xcite . in 0957@xmath37561a and 0957@xmath37561b the uv fe  ii equivalent widths are different by a factor of nearly two , and the differences are visually obvious in the spectra , although these objects are gravitationally - lensed images of the same quasar .",
    "this observation suggests that the fe  ii emission can vary substantially on timescales comparable to the @xmath18  1-year time delay between the two images ( more precisely , 417 days * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the equivalent width of the nearby mg  ii  @xmath282798 emission and also of c  iii ]  @xmath281909 appeared unchanged .",
    "iron abundance seems very unlikely to be the cause of the difference .",
    "ly@xmath5 fluorescence is a possible cause of the difference , given that the ly@xmath5 flux in q0957@xmath37561a , b has been observed to be variable on timescales ( observed frame ) of weeks @xcite .",
    "the continuum is substantially bluer in the image ( a ) in which the fe   ii is weaker .",
    "@xcite initially attributed this difference in continuum shape to differential reddening along the different light - paths , but , in a note added in proof , subsequently attributed it to the proximity of lensing galaxy g1 , at @xmath38 from 0957@xmath37561b , in agreement with @xcite and then @xcite .",
    "( note that colour variability has , however , been detected since by @xcite . )",
    "the lensing of 0957@xmath37561 ( @xmath39 ) arises from a cluster of galaxies ( @xmath40 ) , and g1 , the brightest cluster member .",
    "g1 is about four times fainter in the @xmath41 passband than 0957@xmath37561b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of @xcite and @xcite , which have much higher resolution and used smaller apertures than the spectra of @xcite and @xcite , show no indication of the @xmath42  break from g1 affecting the spectrum of 0957@xmath37561b at @xmath43  ( rest frame ) , in the vicinity of the low - wavelength end of the uv fe  ii feature .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 of spectra in fig .  1 ( single epoch ) and fig .  3 ( combined epochs ) of @xcite",
    "appear consistent with the apparent differences in the fe  ii emission _ not _ being an artefact arising from g1 .",
    "@xcite have investigated uv fe  ii and fe  iii emission in the spectra of 14 image - pairs for 13 gravitationally - lensed quasars .",
    "they find differences for four image - pairs , one of which is q0957@xmath37561a , b ( apparent for fe  iii only ) .",
    "they attribute these differences to gravitational microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxies , but caution that their result depends strongly on one image pair ( sdss j1353@xmath371138a , b ) .",
    "it is not clear why the explanation of the differences has to be microlensing . from statistical considerations",
    ", they estimate that the uv fe  ii and fe  iii emission arises in a region of size @xmath45 light - days and suggest that it is located within the accretion disk where the continuum originates ( size @xmath18  58 light - days ) .",
    "possible implications of this location for the existence of these ions and for the widths of emission lines are not discussed .",
    "the uv fe  ii emission is usually thought to arise in the broad line region ( blr ) , but is sometimes attributed instead to an intermediate line region ( ilr ) , between the outer blr and the inner torus . @xcite and @xcite , for example , favour the ilr interpretation .",
    "photoionisation equilibrium implies the temperature of the blr gas is @xmath46  k. for such a temperature the thermal line - widths are @xmath18  10  km  s@xmath23 , which is very much smaller than the observed line - widths of @xmath18  100020000  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "such a disparity might mean that the blr contains many ( @xmath47 ) small cloudlets to produce an overall smooth profile @xcite , although microturbulence will also cause broadening @xcite , as will rayleigh and thomson scattering @xcite .",
    "in reality , the distribution of the gas is likely to be fractal @xcite .",
    "the view of the structure of the blr has changed somewhat over the years , in substantial part because of the results of reverberation mapping of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the old view",
    "there is a roughly spherical distribution of the cloudlets , each with stratification of the ionisation .",
    "although much is uncertain , in the modern view there is a more flattened distribution of cloudlets @xcite , with a general stratification of the ionisation and density , such that high - ionisation and high density correspond to smaller distances from the central black hole ( bh ) and low - ionisation and low density correspond to larger distances @xcite .",
    "the flattening is more pronounced for low - ionisation lines @xcite .",
    "the blr could be a thick disk of cloudlets or could be bowl - shaped @xcite . in the rpc model ( for radiation pressure confinement , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the cloudlets are replaced by a blr that is a single stratified slab .",
    "high - ionisation lines tend to be broader than low - ionisation lines in the same quasar .",
    "the low - ionisation optical fe  ii and mg  ii emission are thought to arise in the same outer regions @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence from reverberation mapping of seyfert galaxies that the uv fe  ii arises at smaller radii in the blr than the optical fe  ii and is correspondingly broader ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flattened distribution rotates about the central bh , but there is also ( macro)turbulent motion of @xmath18  1000  km  s@xmath23 or more @xcite .",
    "turbulence ( macroturbulence ) refers to bulk motion measured orthogonal to the plane of rotation , but will be present in the plane of rotation too @xcite .",
    "microturbulence refers to ( non - thermal ) motion within cloudlets or between adjacent cloudlets @xcite .",
    "the rotation velocity exceeds the turbulence velocity by factors of a few times .",
    "failure to account for the turbulence will lead to the mass of the bh being overestimated @xcite . in the case of a blr",
    "viewed face - on ( i.e.  viewing along the rotation axis , sometimes also expressed as `` pole - on '' ) , one is seeing mainly the turbulent motion in the emission lines .",
    "the fwhm that we measure for the broad emission lines is thus a function of viewing angle @xcite .",
    "the amount of gas in the blr exceeds by a large factor ( @xmath18  @xmath48@xmath49 ) that needed to account for the line emission .",
    "the notion of `` locally optimally - emitting cloud '' ( loc ) , @xcite is that the regions that are emitting strongly are those where the conditions to do so are optimal . a change in the continuum luminosity can then result in an apparent change of the scale - size of the blr , simply because another region is then the optimal emitter . from simple modelling of photoionisation , the scale - size should increase approximately as the square - root of the ionising luminosity @xcite .",
    "a particular cloudlet or small region will receive the doppler - shifted ly@xmath5 profile of the whole blr ensemble ( i.e.  broadened by the macroturbulent and rotational velocities ) but sliced by narrow absorption lines from intervening cloudlets ( gaskell , private communication ) .",
    "( this fact is relevant to ly@xmath5 fluorescence , as mentioned in section  [ subsecfeii ] . )",
    "the cloudlet itself will be emitting with a line - width comparable to the sound velocity or microturbulence velocity .",
    "the investigation of metallicity in the nuclear regions of quasars proceeds by analysis of the broad emission lines and intrinsic ( i.e.  associated with the quasar , not intervening ) narrow absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the growth of the central supermassive bh is believed to arise from accretion following large - scale events in the galaxies  mergers and interactions  and from quieter , secular processes such as flows along bars .",
    "infall of ( possibly pristine ) gas might also be involved .",
    "the gas that approaches the nucleus either forms stars or it settles into the dusty torus , and from there spirals into the accretion disk and the bh .",
    "the distinction between the torus and the accretion disk is that the temperature of the accretion disk exceeds the sublimation temperature of the dust .",
    "the blr is actually the turbulent gas above the accretion disk , and which rotates with it .",
    "( boundaries between accretion disk , torus and blr are related to the cooling process that is dominant : continuum - cooling for the accretion disk ; thermal emission from dust for the torus ; line - cooling for the blr . ) some small fraction of the incoming gas is expelled in a wind that removes angular momentum and allows the accretion .",
    "dynamical models of the blr suggest inflows , outflows , and orbital motion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity of the blr should be that of the torus .",
    "@xcite discuss , and give a good illustration in their figure 1 , the accretion disk extending from the bh to the outer edge of the torus , where the torus dust sublimates , with the clouds ( low - ionisation clouds at least ) of the blr `` boiling '' ( inflowing and outflowing ) from its outer parts . in their interpretation the atmosphere of the outer parts of the disk is cool enough for dust to be present . the outflow of the boiling is driven locally by the accretion disk  a dust - driven wind  , but the driving force is cut - off at large heights by the central radiation sublimating the dust , leading to infall . outflow and inflow would lead to turbulence .",
    "note , however , that , for ngc  4151 , @xcite find evidence that the inner torus is actually located beyond the sublimation radius and that it does not have a sharp boundary ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite consider the bright phase of a quasar to correspond to a final stage of accretion during which the bh roughly doubles its mass .",
    "this phase lasts for @xmath50  yr for accretion at @xmath18  50 per cent of the eddington rate .",
    "the metallicities of the blr and the torus can be expected to be typical of the central parts of galaxies at the redshifts concerned .",
    "the more massive galaxies can be expected to have higher central metallicities because of repeated episodes of star formation , and because the deeper potential well increases the retention of gas for recycling .",
    "the observations indicate nuclear metallicities of solar to several times solar .",
    "it is also possible that mergers and interactions could drive relatively unprocessed gas into the nuclear regions , which would reduce the metallicity",
    ". radiation pressure could , in principle , concentrate metals relative to hydrogen in some regions ( e.g.  in bal outflows or in the outer parts of accretion disks ) , but observationally the effect is not currently known to occur @xcite .",
    "quasar activity is believed to be preceded by star - formation activity .",
    "one might then expect to see a dependence on redshift of the metallicity of quasars , but none has so far been detected for @xmath29 . as mentioned in section  [ subsecfeii ] , enrichment of the blr appears to be completed well before ( 0.31  gyr ) the visible quasar activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is not an exclusive relation however : high fe  ii emission does not guarantee narrow mg  ii , and narrow mg  ii emission does not guarantee high fe  ii emission .",
    "this tendency of the highest fe  ii emission favouring relatively narrow mg  ii emission is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fwhm2798_f1 ] , which shows , for the dr7qso10 sample , the distributions of @xmath71 for the 1531 ultrastrong emitters ( solid histogram , blue online ) and for the 7086 strong emitters ( hatched histogram , red online ) .",
    "of course , the boundary between strong and ultrastrong is somewhat arbitrary , but the difference in the distributions is nevertheless very clear .",
    "a one - sided mann - whitney test indicates that there is a relative shift to smaller values of the @xmath71 distribution for the ultrastrong emitters at a level of significance given by a p - value of @xmath158 .",
    "the median shift is estimated as @xmath159   .",
    "a similar result is obtained if instead we use the fwhm_mgii parameter ( whole profile  i.e.  broad @xmath37 narrow ) from @xcite : p - value of @xmath160 and median shift of @xmath161    ( for 1530 ultrastrong emitters and 7065 strong emitters here , since fwhm_mgii is available only for 25613 of the 25700 quasars ) ) , which is different from our @xmath1 measure ; there is no statement of which of their measures of mg  ii fwhm has been used ; we mentioned in an earlier footnote our suspicion that in their measures involving subtraction of a narrow component ( at least ) , residual ( after subtraction of the iron template ) neighbouring fe  ii can be wrongly attributed to broad mg  ii ; our method of measuring the fwhm of the mg  ii was intended to avoid neighbouring fe  ii . ] .",
    "the tendency is not detected with the sfqs10 sample ( the 80 from 83 for which we can measure all of @xmath1 , @xmath71 , and @xmath3 ) by applying the mann - whitney test to the ultrastrong ( 12 quasars ) and strong emitters ( 30 quasars ) , and so it is presumably less marked than the effect for @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless , we can note the consistency of this tendency with the properties of the sfqs10 sample : 23 of the 42 quasars ( 55 per cent ) that are ultrastrong or strong emitters have narrow @xmath162   , whereas only 13 of the 38 quasars ( 34 per cent ) that are weak emitters have @xmath163   .",
    "although we do not show it here , the tendency for @xmath70 is different : higher @xmath70 tends to favour broader @xmath71 , as found also by @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the fe  ii emission and the mg   ii line arise from the same locations within the blr then , presumably , any hypothetical orientation effects of the flattened blr would be identical . in that case",
    ", we can suspect a direct connection between narrow @xmath71 and enhanced @xmath1 .",
    "narrow ( blr ) mg  ii line emission presumably corresponds to narrow ( blr ) ly@xmath5 emission .",
    "( the widths of mg  ii and ly@xmath5 are presumably both determined by the mass of the central bh , but are unlikely to be identical because of stratification , ly@xmath5 absorption , ly@xmath5 blending with n  v @xmath164 , and other factors . )",
    "we have few opportunities to test such a correspondence because ly@xmath5 will be in the ultraviolet region when mg  ii and fe  ii are observed in the optical region .",
    "however , from our own data , we do have galex ultraviolet spectra for a few of the quasars for which we have optical mmt / hectospec spectra ( see appendix  [ secappendixmmthectospecgalex ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ w1216_galex_example_spectra ] we show the galex ultraviolet spectra , converted to rest - frame wavelengths , for the ultrastrong emitters qso412 and qso425 , for which we previously showed optical spectra , converted to rest - frame wavelengths , in fig .",
    "[ w2400_example_spectra ] . clearly , qso412 has broad mg  ii line emission , and qso425 has narrow mg  ii line emission . clearly , ly@xmath5 is correspondingly broad for qso412 and correspondingly narrow for qso425 .",
    "for ly@xmath5 the ratio of fwhms , qso412  :  qso425 , is 1.6 ( from 24.4    and 15.7   ) , and for mg  ii it is 2.1 ( from 50.6    and 24.2   ) .",
    "see appendix  [ secappendixmmthectospecgalex ] for further details .",
    "also , note again what we emphasised above : the _ tendency _ of the highest fe  ii emitters favouring relatively narrow mg  ii emission does not exclude the occurrence of quasars such as qso412 with ultrastrong @xmath1 and broad mg  ii .         for a given ly@xmath5 flux , a narrow line will concentrate relatively more flux than a broad line in the region ly@xmath5 @xmath165 @xmath34    @xcite that is most important for ly@xmath5 fluorescence of the uv fe  ii .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that ly@xmath5 fluorescence might be in large part responsible for both the universal dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath3 and the differential dependence for lqg members .",
    "we mentioned previously that , for ly@xmath5 fluorescence , the ratio of fwhm to equivalent width of the ly@xmath5 would be a useful central - concentration parameter for associating with the fe  ii emission .",
    "for the spectral coverage of our quasar data we can not routinely calculate this ratio for ly@xmath5 , which then falls in the ultraviolet region . perhaps , however , mg  ii can be used as at least a rough guide to the ratio for ly@xmath5 . in fig .",

    "note that increasing @xmath1 emission seems to be associated with decreasing values of the ratio @xmath166 .",
    "that is , increasingly strong uv fe  ii emission does seem to be associated with increasingly centrally - concentrated mg  ii emission at least .",
    "note again , of course , that the mg  ii emission can be affected by fe  ii emission , especially on the blueward side .",
    "we might expect narrow emission lines to have some correspondence with relatively less massive central bhs  either to agn that intrinsically have low bh masses or to younger quasars that are still growing their central bhs and have not yet reached their mature state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ log10mbh_w2400_f1_c ] , we plot @xmath1 against @xmath167 for dr7qso10 , where @xmath168 is the adopted `` fiducial '' virial bh mass from @xcite .",
    "@xmath168 is actually determined by a fwhm , acting as a proxy for virial velocity , and by a continuum luminosity , acting as a proxy for blr radius .",
    "again , the number of points ( 25670 of the previous 25700 have a measurement of @xmath168 ) is too high for an ordinary scatterplot to be a useful illustration and the plot shows instead the kernel - smoothed densities of points in a @xmath103 grid . from shen",
    "typical errors in the bh masses , propagated from the measurement uncertainties in the continuum luminosities and the fwhms , are @xmath18  0.050.2  dex , but the additional statistical uncertainty in the calibration of virial masses is @xmath18  0.30.4  dex .",
    "nevertheless , there does appear to be a trend in fig .",
    "[ log10mbh_w2400_f1_c ] , with average ultrastrong emitters having smaller bh masses than average weak emitters by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , the ultrastrong emitters are not in the low - bh - mass category ( @xmath169 ) of agn , and we might instead expect that they are still growing their bhs . in that case , increasing @xmath1 emission would have an association with increasingly young quasars .",
    "we further suggest that this possible interpretation in terms of younger quasars helps to clarify the nature of lqgs .",
    "lqgs  regions with an overdensity of quasars  would then be interpreted quite naturally as regions that contain a higher proportion of young quasars than field regions .",
    "in this section we make some further notes on the content of the paper , some of which have a slightly cautionary nature because of the possibilities of small systematic biases in the measurements and because of the difficulty of clarifying further the possible implications of the data .",
    "first of all , we note that there is a correlation of @xmath1 with @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ w2400g_w2400_f1_c ] ) . recall from section  [ secmeasuring ] that @xmath68 is a measure of the gradient of the line taken as the continuum in the @xcite definition of the equivalent width @xmath1 .",
    "it is represented as a colour .",
    "a similar correlation results if instead of @xmath68 we use the similarly - defined continuum colour @xmath75 $ ] , which corresponds to a larger interval of wavelength than @xmath68 .",
    "the correlations are presumably counterparts of correlations with spectral index .    in connection with fig .",
    "[ w2400_example_spectra ] , in section  [ secmeasuring ] , we discussed briefly the effect of artificially changing the curvature of the spectrum of qso412 to resemble that of qso425 .",
    "it reduced @xmath1 from 55.5    to 52.1   , the difference of 3.4    being comparable to the indicative measurement errors .",
    "similarly , for dr7qso10 , we find that @xmath1 for the red quasars ( @xmath170 , 1292 from 25700  so only @xmath18 5 per cent of the total ) in fig .",
    "[ w2400g_w2400_f1_c ] could be biased with respect to @xmath1 for the blue quasars by @xmath171   .",
    "if so , the correlation might then be exaggerated by a small bias in @xmath1 for red quasars with respect to blue but can not be attributed to it .",
    "however , by artificially changing the curvature of the spectra we are clearly also changing the quasars ( from red to blue ) : it may be that the measurements of @xmath1 for the red quasars are mostly legitimate , and not subject to any such small bias .",
    "the @xmath76 function by which we artificially change the curvature of a spectrum ( here and as mentioned in section  [ secmeasuring ] ) is this : first , we multiply by a function of @xmath76 such that @xmath172 is unchanged and @xmath173 is doubled ; then we scale the spectrum such that the median flux density across 2255-2650    is unchanged .",
    "we mentioned previously , in a footnote , that we have reasons to prefer our measure @xmath1 to the uv  ew  fe ( @xmath174 ) measure from template - fitting of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we note that their measure also correlates with @xmath68 and with the continuum colour @xmath75 $ ] , although the trends with their measure have more complexity or internal structure .",
    "this dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath68 and on the similar measure of continuum colour @xmath75 $ ] ( and similarly for the shen et al .",
    "uv  ew  fe measure ) thus appears to be a small dependence of the uv fe on continuum colour .",
    "note that it does not appear to arise from the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath3 that we find ( section  [ subsecfainterw2400 ] ) : @xmath68 appears to be only slightly dependent on @xmath3  see fig .",
    "[ log_l_3000_w2400g_f1_c ] , which plots @xmath68 against @xmath102 as kernel - smoothed densities for the sample dr7qso10 and as points for the sample sfqs10 . for illustration ,",
    "the mann - whitney test applied to the dr7qso10 data , shows that there is a significant ( p - value @xmath121 ) but small dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath102  corresponding to a colour shift of only @xmath175 for the interval @xmath176 compared with the interval @xmath177 .",
    "of course our finding that stronger @xmath1 tends to be associated with fainter @xmath3 combined with the correlation of @xmath1 and @xmath68 means that there must be some tendency , even if small , for @xmath68 to be redder for fainter @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the modelling by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite appears to take spectral index as a fixed quantity rather than a variable .",
    "@xcite do , however , mention that the shape of the spectral energy distribution would be a consideration in future work , although we have not found any subsequent references in which it is considered .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are the following .    1 .",
    "we find that for @xmath2    there is a _ universal _",
    "( i.e.  for quasars in general ) strengthening of @xmath1 with decreasing intrinsic luminosity , @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   in conjunction with the work presented by @xcite",
    ", we find that there is a further , _ differential , _ strengthening of @xmath1 with decreasing @xmath3 for those quasars that are members of large quasar groups , or lqgs .",
    "3 .   we find that increasingly strong @xmath1 tends to be associated with decreasing fwhm of the neighbouring mg  ii @xmath4 broad emission line .",
    "4 .   on the assumption that this trend that @xmath1 increases as the fwhm of mg  ii decreases is true also for the fwhm of the ly@xmath5 emission line ,",
    "we suggest that this dependence of @xmath1 on intrinsic luminosity arises from ly@xmath5 fluorescence .",
    "we make this suggestion because : the wavelength region @xmath178    is important for ly@xmath5 fluorescence of the fe  ii emission ; for a given ly@xmath5 equivalent width , narrower ly@xmath5 emission would enhance the flux in this region , and hence fluorescence of the fe  ii , relative to broader ly@xmath5 emission .",
    "we find that stronger @xmath1 tends to be associated with smaller virial estimates of the mass of the central black hole , by a factor @xmath179 between the ultrastrong emitters ( smaller black holes ) and the weak .",
    "the effect for @xmath1 can then be associated with a range of masses for the central black holes .",
    "stronger @xmath1 emission would correspond to smaller black holes that are still growing .",
    "they will be in fainter quasars , with relatively narrow broad - emission lines , leading to the enhanced ly@xmath5 fluorescence of the uv fe  ii emission . the differential effect for lqgs might then arise from a different mass distribution of the black holes , corresponding , plausibly , to an age distribution that emphasises younger quasars in the lqg environments .",

    "in this paper we have made a little use of our own mmt / hectospec spectra and galex spectra .",
    "we give here some more details , especially for the mmt / hectospec spectra .",
    "table  [ mmt_hecto_quasars ] gives our measurements of @xmath1 and other parameters from these mmt / hectospec spectra , primarily for the redshift range @xmath0 , but , for completeness , with some information for the quasars outside this range included too .",
    "the mmt / hectospec spectra were obtained in 1.6  deg@xmath84 from two adjacent @xmath180 hectospec fields .",
    "the fields intersect the lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 , and u1.54 @xcite , with the last of these being the `` doubtful lqg '' ( a previously published lqg , but one of marginal significance in our catalogue ) .",
    "quasars in the redshift range @xmath83 are of particular interest to us , because this is the range corresponding to our main dr7qso catalogue of lqgs .",
    "the ra , dec ( 2000 ) field centres were approximately : 10:48:40.8 , @xmath3705:24:36 ( @xmath181 ) and 10:50:04.8 , @xmath3704:31:12 ( @xmath182 ) , but some small adjustments were made during the observations across two months .",
    "spectra were obtained during february and april 2010 , covering 36509200    at @xmath18  6    resolution , with integration times typically 5400  s but with some variation . as mentioned previously , we used the wavelength range 39008200    in the measurement of @xmath1 and other parameters from our mmt / hectospec spectra . also as mentioned previously , for our mmt",
    "/ hectospec spectra only , the atmospheric a - band at @xmath18  7600    is prominent and we have interpolated across it . for the redshift range @xmath0 the measurements of @xmath1 do not contain the interpolation . for two of these quasars ,",
    "noted in table  [ mmt_hecto_quasars ] , the mg  ii emission does contain the interpolation and the measurements of @xmath71 could be affected a little . for",
    "three quasars outside the range @xmath0 the measurements of @xmath1 do contain the interpolation , and these too have been noted in table  [ mmt_hecto_quasars ] .",
    "the mmt / hectospec observations of the quasars were `` fibre - filling '' observations  using spare fibres after the objects for the main programme ( on galaxies ) had all been allocated fibres .",
    "the quasar candidates that were selected for observation were drawn from a list that had been prepared previously using the sdss dr1 photometric quasar catalogue of @xcite .",
    "all of the candidates in the list were selected to have @xmath183 ( the catalogue itself was defined by @xmath184 ) .",
    "the candidates chosen from the list for the fibre - filling emphasised first @xmath185",
    "0.70.9 , 1.21.4 , then @xmath185  0.60.7 , 0.91.2 , 1.41.5 , followed by any other @xmath186 values .",
    "however , the later dr6 photometric quasar catalogue of @xcite revised the photometric redshifts , sometimes substantially , and these criteria will have become blurred .",
    "in retrospect , from the mmt / hectospec spectroscopic redshifts , the net effect seems to be that the fibre - filling selected candidates typically with @xmath31 1.02.3 ( 90 per cent ) and a few with @xmath187 0.60.7 ( 10 per cent ) .",
    "the mmt / hectospec observations resulted in spectra for 31 quasars , with redshifts in the range 0.6132.228 , and @xmath11 in the range 18.48620.955 .",
    "of these 31 , 21 have @xmath0 ; these 21 have @xmath11 in the range 18.48620.947 . note that we have taken magnitudes of the mmt / hectospec quasars from the later dr6 photometric quasar catalogue @xcite .",
    "one of the quasars is seen to be a bal quasar ( @xmath188   , strong ) .",
    "six of these 31 are also contained in the dr7qso catalogue .",
    "accurate spectrophotometric calibration was not a particular concern of the mmt / hectospec observations and errors of @xmath189  20 per cent are expected , with the values of @xmath3 and hence log@xmath190l3000 ( table  [ mmt_hecto_quasars ] ) affected correspondingly .",
    "we note the consistency of the data in table  [ mmt_hecto_quasars ] with the tendency of the strongest fe  ii emitters to be associated with relatively narrow mg  ii emission . for @xmath0 and @xmath191 ,",
    "9 of the 12 quasars ( 75 per cent ) that are ultrastrong or strong emitters have narrow @xmath163   , whereas only 2 of the 6 quasars ( 33 per cent ) that are weak emitters ( and with mg  ii unaffected by the a - band ) have @xmath163   .",
    "we have also made a little use of ultraviolet spectra from galex .",
    "these spectra were obtained in parallel with a main programme of imaging from galex within the two mmt / hectospec fields .",
    "the galex fields and the mmt / hectospec fields are essentially the same",
    ". the galex spectra are slitless , in the far - uv ( fuv ) , @xmath18  13501800   , and the near - uv ( nuv ) , @xmath18  18002800   .",
    "the point - source resolutions are @xmath18  10    and @xmath18  25    respectively .",
    "extraction of the spectra was done by galex staff .",
    "galex procedures circumvent overlapped spectra by observing a field with a series of grism - angle rotations relative to the sky . there can be problems of second - order and third - order overlaps in the fuv affecting the brighter and bluer objects .",
    "we have galex spectra for 11 of the mmt / hectospec quasars listed in table  [ mmt_hecto_quasars ] .",
    "of these 11 , five provide usable spectra across the ly@xmath5 region .",
