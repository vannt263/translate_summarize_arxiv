    "@xcite introduced a new family of erasure codes , called _ regenerating codes _ , which allow for efficient single node repairs by minimizing repair bandwidth .",

    "constructions for these two families of codes can be found in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "an @xmath0 regenerating code @xmath1 , for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is used to store a file of size @xmath4 across a network of @xmath5 nodes , where each node stores @xmath6 symbols from @xmath7 , a finite field with @xmath8 elements , such that the stored file can be recovered by downloading the data from any set of @xmath9 nodes , where @xmath9 is called the _ reconstruction degree_. note , that this means that any @xmath10 node failures ( i.e. , erasures ) can be corrected by this code .",
    "when a single node fails , a newcomer node which substitutes the failed node contacts any set of @xmath11 nodes and downloads @xmath12 symbols of each node in this set to reconstruct the failed data .",

    "et al . presented a construction for mbr codes which have the additional property of exact _",
    "repair by transfer _ , or exact _",
    "uncoded repair_. in other words , the code proposed in  @xcite allows for efficient node repairs where no decoding is needed .",
    "every node participating in a node repair process just passes one symbol ( @xmath15 ) which will be directly stored in the newcomer node .",
    "this construction is based on a concatenation of an outer mds code with an inner repetition code based on a complete graph as follows .",
    "let @xmath16 be the size of a file , which corresponds to mbr capacity with @xmath15  @xcite .",

    "these codes , called _ dress _ ( distributed replication based exact simple storage ) codes  @xcite , consist of the concatenation of an outer mds code and an inner repetition code called _ fractional repetition _ ( fr ) code .",
