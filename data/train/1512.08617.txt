    "reachable sets have attracted several mathematicians since longer times both in theoretical and in numerical analysis .",
    "one common definition collects end points of feasible solutions of a control problem starting from a common inital set and reaching a point _ up to _ a given end time , the other definition is similar but prescribes a _ fixed _ end time in which the point is reached .",
    "the former definition automatically leads to a monotone behavior of the reachable sets with respect to inclusion , since the reachable set up to a given time is the union of reachable sets for a fixed time .",
    "reachable sets with and without control constraints appear in control theory ( e.g.  in stability results ) , in optimal control ( e.g.  in analysis for robustness ) and in set - valued analysis . for reachable sets at a given end time of linear or nonlinear control problems , properties like convexity for linear control problems at a given end time ( due to aumann and his study of aumann s integral for set - valued maps in @xcite ) , closedness and connectedness under weak assumptions for nonlinear systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , ",
    "are well - known .",
    "the lipschitz continuity of reachable sets with respect to the initial value is also established and is a result of the filippov theorem which proves the existence of neighboring solutions for lipschitz systems . to mention one further result",
    "is the density of solutions of the non - convexified control problem in the relaxed system in which the right - hand side is convexified .    on the other hand reachable sets appear in many applications .",
    "they appear in natural generalizations of differential equations with discontinuous right - hand side and hybrid systems ( e.g.  via the filippov regularization in @xcite ) , in gradient inclusions with maximally monotone right - hand side ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as generalizations of control problems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ,   .",
    "many practical examples are mentioned in  @xcite and in references therein .",
    "the approaches for the numerical computation of reachable sets mainly split into two classes , those for reachable sets up to a given time and the other ones for reachable sets at a given end time .",
    "we will give here only exemplary references , since the literature is very rich .",
    "there are methods based on overestimation and underestimation of reachable sets based on ellipsoids @xcite , zonotopes @xcite or on approximating the reachable set with support functions resp .  supporting points @xcite .",
    "other popular and well - studied approaches involve level - set methods , semi - lagrangian schemes and the computation of an associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation , see  e.g.  @xcite or are based on the viability concept  @xcite and the viability kernel algorithm  @xcite .",
    "further methods @xcite are set - valued generalizations of quadrature methods and runge - kutta methods initiated by the works  @xcite . solvers for optimal control problems are another source for methods approximating reachable sets , see  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite a more detailed review of some methods up to 1994 appeared , see also  @xcite and the books and book chapters in  @xcite for a more recent overview and references therein .    here",
    ", we will focus on set - valued quadrature methods and set - valued runge - kutta methods with the help of support functions or supporting points , since they do not suffer on the wrapping effect or on an exploding number of vertices and the error of restricting computations only for finitely many directions can be easily estimated .",
    "furthermore , they belong to the most efficient and fast methods ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  9 , p.  128 ) ) for linear control problems to which we restrict the computation of the minimum time function @xmath0 .",
    "these methods enjoy an increasing attention also in neighboring research fields , e.g.  in the computation of viability kernels  @xcite or reachable sets for hybrid systems in  @xcite as well as in the computation of interpolation of set - valued maps @xcite , minkowski sums of convex sets ( @xcite ) as well as of the dini , michel - penot and mordukhovich subdifferentials  @xcite .",
    "we refer to  @xcite ( and references therein ) for technical details on the numerical implementation , although we will lay out the main ideas of this approach for reader s convenience .    in optimal control theory the regularity of the minimum time functions",
    "is studied intensively , see e.g.  in  @xcite and references therein . for",
    "the error estimates in this paper it will be essential to single out example classes for which the minimum time function is lipschitz ( no order reduction of the set - valued method ) or hlder - continuous with exponent @xmath1 ( order reduction by the square root ) .",
    "minimum time functions are usually computed by solving hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations and by the dynamic programming principle , see e.g.  @xcite . in this approach , the minimal requirement on",
    "the regularity of @xmath0 is the continuity , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the solution of a hjb equation with suitable boundary conditions gives immediately  after a transformation ",
    "the minimum time function and its level sets provide a description of the reachable sets .",
    "a natural question occurring is whether it is also possible to do the other way around , i.e.  reconstruct the minimum time function @xmath0 if knowing the reachable sets .",
    "one of the attempts was done in @xcite , where the approach is based on pde solvers and on the reconstruction of the optimal control and solution via the value function . on the other hand ,",
    "our approach in this work is completely different .",
    "it is based on very efficient quadrature methods for convex reachable sets as described in section  3 .    in this article",
    "we present a novel approach for calculating the minimum time function .",
    "the basic idea is to use set - valued methods for approximating reachable sets at a given end time with computations based on support functions resp .  supporting points . by reversing the time and",
    "start from the convex target as initial set we compute the reachable sets for times on a ( coarser ) time grid . due to the strictly expanding condition for reachable sets , the corresponding end time",
    "is assigned to all boundary points of the computed reachable sets .",
    "since we discretize in time and in space ( by choosing a finite number of outer normals for the computation of supporting points ) , the vertices of the polytopes forming the fully discrete reachable sets are considered as data points of an irregular triangulated domain . on this simplicial triangulation",
    ", a piecewise linear approximation yields a fully discrete approximation of the minimum time function .    the well - known interpolation error and the convergence results for the set - valued method can be applied to yield an easy - to - prove error estimate by taking into account the regularity of the minimum time function .",
    "it requires at least the continuity and involves the maximal diameter of the simplices in the used triangulation .",
    "a second error estimate is proved without explicitely assuming the continuity of the minimum time function and depends only on the time interval between the computed ( backward ) reachable sets .",
    "the computation does not need the nonempty interior of the target set in contrary to the hamilton - jacobi - bellman approach , for singletons the error estimate even improves .",
    "it is also able to compute discontinuous minimum time functions , since the underlying set - valued method can also compute lower - dimensional reachable sets .",
    "there is no explicit dependence of the algorithm and the error estimates on the smoothness of optimal solutions or controls .",
    "these results are devoted to reconstructing discrete optimal trajectories which reach a set of supporting points from a given target for a class of linear control problems and also proving the convergence of discrete optimal controls by the use of nonsmooth and variational analysis .",
    "the main tool is attouch s theorem that allows to benefit from the convergence of the discrete reachable sets to the time - continuous one .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows : in section  2 we collect notations , definitions and basic properties of convex analysis , set operations , reachable sets and the minimum time function .",
    "the convexity of the reachable set for linear control problems and the characterization of its boundary via the level - set of the minimum time function is the basis for the algorithm formulated in the next section .",
    "we briefly introduce the reader to set - valued quadrature methods and runge - kutta methods and their implementation and discuss the convergence order for the fully discrete approximation of reachable sets at a given time both in time and in space . in the next subsection we present the error estimate for the fully discrete minimum time function which depends on the regularity of the continuous minimum time function and on the convergence order of the underlying set - valued method .",
    "another error estimate expresses the error only on the time period between the calculated reachable sets .",
    "the last subsection discusses the construction of discrete optimal trajectories and convergence of discrete optimal controls .",
