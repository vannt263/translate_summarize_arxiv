    "this paper intends to introduce the topic of weaving with more than two colours into the mathematical literature and to derive some initial general results .",
    "the first section introduces weaving and striping , the second discusses colouring without restriction on the number of colours , the third the restriction to the same finite number of colours in both directions , the fourth the example of thick striping with three colours , and the fifth the same with four and six colours .",
    "all depends on the perfectness of the fabric colouring .",
    "what has to be arranged is that the colouring of the strands of the fabric be compatible with the symmetry group of the fabric , so that every symmetry operation of the underlying fabric s topology is a coherent mapping of the colours of the strands .",
    "the colours need not be preserved but may be permuted .",
    "the first result ( lemma [ lem:1 ] ) shows what restrictions are needed for thick striping with all stripes of different colours .",
    "no restrictions ( lemma [ lem:2 ] ) allow perfect colouring by the assignment of different colours to all single strands ( thin striping ) with all stripes of different colours .",
    "all sorts of fabrics ( theorem [ thm:1 ] ) can be perfectly coloured by thin striping or , with the exception of fabrics in genus i or ii , assignment of different colours to all adjacent pairs of strands ( thick striping ) . section [ sect : finite ] restricts the number of colours to finite and finds a couple of necessary conditions on the colour choice for perfect colouring , which jointly are sufficient ( theorem [ thm:2 ] ) .",
    "the colours of the warps must be either the same as the colours of the wefts or they must be all different ( lemma [ lem:5 ] ) .",
    "more detailed results state that in certain species of fabrics it is possible to colour warps and wefts perfectly by thick striping with an odd number of colours ( theorem [ thm:4 ] ) and in certain species of fabrics it is possible with an even number of colours ( theorem [ thm:5 ] ) .",
    "weaving was introduced into the mathematical literature by grnbaum and shephard with ` satins and twills : an introduction to the geometry of fabrics ' @xcite , and satins and twills are a good place to begin .",
    "first , a _",
    "fabric _ is a woven structure that is sufficiently coherent that it does not fall apart . without that constraint",
    "it is called a _ prefabric _ @xcite .",
    "basic definitions are in @xcite or as indicated .",
    "the weaving patterns of interest to mathematicians so far have been those that grnbaum and shephard introduced , periodic in the plane with strands perpendicular and with symmetry groups @xmath0 transitive on strands , making them _ isonemal_. the symmetry groups to which reference will be made here are the wallpaper groups @xmath0 of @xcite rather than the full three - dimensional symmetry group @xmath1 of the prefabric .",
    "each symmetry operation of @xmath0 will be combined with ( or not ) reflection in the plane @xmath2 of the fabric , represented by @xmath3 . in the standard diagram , called the _",
    "design _ , of a weaving pattern , the vertical strands called _ warps _ are coloured dark and the horizontal strands called _ wefts _ are coloured pale so that the visual appearance indicates which strand is over which strand in the places where they cross .",
    "the places where they cross are all that is of interest , and so they are taken to be square _ cells _ without boundary tessellating the plane , infinite for convenience .",
    "so much is square here that the term ` cell ' was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the requirement of periodicity means that there are fundamental blocks of the pattern whose translates cover the plane @xcite .",
    "the requirement of transitivity of the symmetry group / isonemality of the fabric means that every strip of cells can be transformed into every other strip of cells , vertical or horizontal , by a symmetry operation , perhaps with the reversal of dark and pale , effected by @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the standard colouring of the strands of an isonemal weaving structure is a _ perfect colouring _ in the standard sense that every symmetry operation preserves the colouring .",
    "the definition of perfect colouring allows reversal of dark and pale ; it needs to preserve the colouring rather than the colours .",
    "the operation @xmath3 can not itself be a symmetry operation , but it is involved in many symmetry operations ; it represents a total reversal of which strand covers which strand over the whole plane , reflection in @xmath2 , the plane of the fabric .",
    "i illustrate these ideas with a few examples .",
    "@xmath4    the simplest examples are twills in which each line ( vertical or horizontal ) of the pattern is formed from the line beside it by an _ offset _ of one cell .",
    "there are two examples in fig .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e ] .",
    "it is obvious that parallel lines are the same , and it is not hard to see that warps reflect to wefts . in those diagrams , as in fig .  [ fig:0a;0b ] , the broad black lines indicate mirrors of that symmetry in perpendicular directions .",
    "something to note about oblique reflection is that it reverses which strands are vertical and which are horizontal ; so the design as simply reflected has its colours reversed by the colouring convention ( vertical dark , horizontal pale ) . in order to restore the colours to the original ,",
    "it is necessary to reverse the colours again with @xmath3 .",
    "the broad dashed lines in figg .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e ] and [ fig:0a;0b ] ( four in each ; four are very short ) represent glide - reflections that reverse warp and weft like mirrors and so must be combined with @xmath3 ; so each dark diagonal band of figg .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e ] and [ fig:0a;0b ] is glide - reflected to the next diagonal band .",
    "obviously reflections and glide - reflections with horizontal or vertical axes do not reverse warp and weft , but we have none of them in the fabrics we are considering here .    what are in a way the second - simplest examples are satins , where there is very little dark in the pattern ( as in the twill examples of fig .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e ] , one cell per one - dimensional period , called _ order _",
    "@xcite ) but where the offset is greater than one moving from strand to adjacent strand .",
    "@xmath5    the examples of fig .",
    "[ fig:0a;0b ] are rhombic satins because the dark cells are at the corners of rhombs that are not square .",
    "the first example ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0a;0b]a ) has offset to the left of three from row to next row up and order 8 , and the second ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0a;0b]b ) has offset four to the left and order 15 . to make the fabric isonemal",
    ", the offset has to be relatively prime to the order @xcite .",
    "these examples have perpendicular mirrors and axes of glide - reflection and so inevitably centres of half - turns where they intersect , represented by diamonds that are hollow because they do not need @xmath3 to be symmetries .",
    "there are a number of ways in which the four examples so far are anomalous .",
    "their _ lattice units _",
    ", that is fundamental blocks whose vertices are images of one another under symmetry translations @xcite , are all rhombs ( outlined in the figures ) , whereas most species of isonemal fabrics have rectangular ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a]b ) or square ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a]a ) lattice units .",
    "and so far nothing has had quarter - turn symmetries , and even some satins have that feature , the so - called square satins where the dark cells are the corners of squares .",
    "@xmath6    for example , the satin of fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a]a has offset 2 to the right ascending and order 5 .",
    "the diagram illustrates two different square lattice units , one centred on a dark cell , the other with dark - cell corners .",
    "it also illustrates centres of quarter - turns that need @xmath3 to make them symmetries , represented by filled square boxes @xcite . in this diagram , as in figg .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e ] and [ fig:0a;0b ] , thin lines outline lattice units .    now that you have seen the attractive pictures to which i have referred and perhaps some others , i define some technical terms .",
    "the fabric designs shown so far have as a symmetry translating a row to the adjacent row and offsetting it by one ( a twill ) or more cells ( a satin or , with more dark cells as in fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a]b , a twillin ) .",
    "prefabrics with those symmetries are said to be of genus i @xcite .",
    "genus ii has translation to each adjacent row as for i but combined with @xmath3 . these genera can overlap , as can the remaining three .",
    "genus iii has rotation to each adjacent row by a half - turn without @xmath3 .",
    "genus iv has rotation to each adjacent row by a half - turn with @xmath3 .",
    "genus v has rotation to the row adjacent in one direction by a half - turn without @xmath3 and to the row adjacent in the opposite direction by a half - turn _ with _ @xmath3 .",
    "you may notice that the overlap of these is illustrated by plain weave , that with diagram a chess board , which lies in all five genera .",
    "as the matter of genera illustrates , the symmetry of weaving patterns can be rather complex .",
    "so much so that in the first few years of work on the subject no one took the trouble to sort them out entirely .",
    "this was finally done by richard roth @xcite , followed up by a paper @xcite on the two - colouring of the strands not necessarily according to the convention .",
    "roth found that the _ types _ of the symmetry groups could be represented well by the pair consisting of the crystallographic type of the group @xmath0 of all the symmetry operations with or without reversal of dark and pale and the crystallographic type of the group @xmath7 of the symmetry operations without reversal of dark and pale .",
    "these pairs represent the types of groups , the latter group @xmath7 being the _ side - preserving _ subgroup of the full symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "( in fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a ] , the lattice units of @xmath7 and of @xmath0 coincide . )",
    "he writes the pair with the types separated by a stroke as though it represented a factor group .",
    "when the side - preserving subgroup is the whole group , he writes @xmath8 so that @xmath9 means that the subgroup is of the same type @xmath10 as the group but is a proper subset .",
    "i m not going to list them all but , for fabrics of order more than four , there are 39 allowable combinations and so 39 roth types of symmetry groups of isonemal prefabrics ( falling apart does nt matter to symmetry ) .",
    "the 39 types can be divided into three broad categories .",
    "110 have only parallel axes of symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a]b ) @xcite .",
    "1132 have perpendicular axes of symmetry ( figg .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e ] , [ fig:0a;0b ] , [ fig:6a;6b ] ) @xcite .",

    "[ fig : two;10a]a , [ fig:81a;85a ] , [ fig:7b;85b]b ) @xcite .",
    "the reason for excluding prefabrics of order 2 , 3 , and 4 is that , while there are only a few of them , they are mostly exceptions that do nt fit into the general schemes .",
    "for instance , some of them have vertical and horizontal axes of symmetry .",
    "accordingly their symmetry groups are called _ exceptional _ , and so i ll be discussing what is not exceptional .",
    "i have illustrated most of the possible symmetry operations and their symbols in diagrams .",
    "it would be a good idea to finish , since the interest in this material lies mainly in how attractive fabric designs often are . the genus - i twillin 12 - 183 - 1 in fig .",

    "[ fig:81a;85a]b , of genus iv and v , illustrates that the two sorts of quarter - turns can both appear in a symmetry group but that , when they do , the half - turns at mid - sides of the square lattice units are of the side - reversing type represented by the filled diamonds . dashed lines in fig .  [ fig:81a;85a ] will be explained next .",
    "the last two examples illustrate the only other feature of the diagrams that i need to mention .",

    "[ fig:81a;85a]b ) , because the filled diamonds and filled boxes of the symmetry group , involving @xmath3 , can not appear in the side - preserving subgroup , the diamonds simply disappear and the filled boxes at mid - sides should appear as hollow diamonds , since the composition of two side - reversing quarter - turns is a side - preserving half - turn .",
    "what s left is the side - preserving quarter - turns and the half - turns where the other quarter - turns used to be .",
    "the lattice unit is bigger than that for @xmath0 . finally in this discussion of lattice units ,",
    "the centre of a square lattice unit can be either at corners of cells as in figures 3a ( upper ) and [ fig:81a;85a ] or at the centre of a cell , as in the lower example in fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a]a . in the former case , lattice - unit levels can go only as far as four , and in the latter case only as far as two @xcite .",
    "once one knows what the groups are , one knows the sizes of the lattice units , and it s a matter of filling in the blanks to determine all of the isonemal fabrics with lattice units of any particular size .",
    "i found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that i had to refine roth s taxonomy of groups somewhat to produce a taxonomy of fabrics .",
    "so where he has types of group numbered from 1 to 39 with many inclusions ",
    "groups that are subgroups of other groups , i have species and subspecies of prefabrics that do not overlap numbered @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , 3 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , 6 , ",

    "inter alia _ , the square satins of even order .",
    "the square satins of odd order ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two;10a]a ) fall in subspecies @xmath25 .    before the weaving of cubes was considered in @xcite and their 2-colouring in @xcite , the analogous weaving of tori should have been mentioned .",
    "a standard weaving design is a 2-colour tessellation of the plane , and such a 2-colour tessellation can be interpreted as a weaving design for a flat torus in several ways , although not arbitrarily . the _ locus classicus _ of flat torus tessellation is @xcite building on @xcite . it makes no sense to identify as opposite sides of the map to the torus what is not identical in the planar design . for a design of order @xmath29 , the simplest thing to do is to use an @xmath29-by-@xmath29 square of cells as the 2-dimensional period parallelogram and map it to the torus .",
    "for example , a quarter of fig .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e]a .",
    "there are then @xmath29 strands in the vertical and the horizontal directions ; isonemality makes sense and is preserved .",
    "if an @xmath29-by-@xmath32 rectangle of cells were used , opposite sides could be identified , but horizontal and vertical strands could not be interchanged by an isometry .",
    "on the other hand , an @xmath33-by-@xmath33 square would do as well as making @xmath34 .",
    "an example with @xmath35 is the whole of fig .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e]a .",
    "perhaps more interesting is to use an @xmath7 lattice unit as period parallelogram or , when it is a rhomb , the rectangle containing it as within fig .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e]a .",
    "the number of strands in each direction , now oblique , will be reduced by the identification , in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig:8d;8e]a to a single strand .",
    "the reduction in the number of strands occurred also in the weaving of cubes in @xcite , where a design of order 10 required only 6 strands to weave the cube using an oblique @xmath0 lattice unit for each face and the order-20 design of fig .",
    "16b required only 8 strands .",
    "the latter design ( topological , not visual ) is used in figg .",
    "14 and 15 of @xcite to 2-colour a woven cube .",
    "this is not the place to discuss what the definition of an isonemal weaving of a torus or klein bottle should be .",
    "the visual appearance of a coloured fabric from the obverse side i refer to as a _ pattern_. such a pattern , when it consists of an array of dark and pale congruent cells tessellating the plane , is given a topological meaning , the _ design _ of a fabric .",
    "as we shall be considering patterns different from the design of a fabric , the distinction is important ; a design is the pattern of a fabric that is normally coloured .",
    "so a two - colour pattern can be interpreted as a design or not .",
    "normal colouring has a consequence that other colourings of the strands need not have . because at every point not on the boundary of a strand the two strands preferentially ranked are of two different colours , a design s colour complement ( switching dark and pale ) is the appearance of the fabric from behind as though viewed from the obverse side in a mirror set up behind @xmath2 , the plane of the fabric , its reverse . when a fabric is coloured normally the reverse pattern is the colour complement of the obverse pattern .",
    "to this point colours ( dark and pale ) have been used for their topological meaning .",
    "they are now going to be used more generally .",

    "if all of the weave symmetries of a fabric with coloured strands are colour symmetries , then the choice of the strand colours is said to be _ perfect _ or _ symmetric _ , where i shall use exclusively the former term .",
    "the interaction of design and pattern is important because the weave symmetry group is that of the fabric represented by the two - colour pattern that is its design , the ` group of the design ' for short , but the permutation ( identity or other ) of colours occurs only in the pattern that represents the colouring of the strands , identical to the design only with normal colouring of the strands .",
