    "with the ever - improving quality of experimental data obtained at the lhc , developing theoretical tools to describe more and more complex physical processes has never been more relevant than it is today .",
    "going to higher - orders in perturbation theory while being able to perform fast numerical computations is requested to achieve accurate theoretical predictions . the conventional way to compute next - to - leading order ( nlo ) or next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections is dimensional regularization ( dreg ) @xcite . within this formalism",
    ", real and virtual integrals are computed separately in @xmath1 instead of @xmath2 dimensions , and singularities  which manifest themselves under the form of @xmath3 poles  are subtracted using one of the many existing techniques @xcite , as guaranteed by the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem @xcite . however , this approach may not be the most efficient when dealing with multi - loop multi - leg processes as one has to deal with complex final - state phase - spaces for each of the different contributions . moreover",
    ", building all the necessary counter - terms can be far from being trivial and is in general very time - consuming .",
    "+ we will present in this article an alternative method called four - dimensional unsubtraction ( fdu ) @xcite , which is based on the loop - tree duality ( ltd ) theorem @xcite .",
    "this method allows to combine , at the integrand level , virtual and real contributions using a suitable and physically motivated mapping between momenta , so the cancellation of singularities is achieved locally , meaning that the integration can be performed in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the ltd theorem allows to rewrite loop scattering amplitudes as a sum of phase - space integrals , with slightly modified propagators . for a generic @xmath4-particle one - loop integral with massive scalar particles , @xmath5=-\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\int_{\\ell}\\tilde{\\delta}(q_i)\\prod\\limits_{j=1,j\\neq i}^{n}g_d(q_i;q_j)\\,,\\ ] ] where the internal momenta are written @xmath6 , the feynman propagators @xmath7 , and the so - called dual propagators @xmath8 . the delta function @xmath9 sets the internal lines on - shell by selecting the pole of the feynman propagators with positive energy and negative imaginary part .",
    "finally , @xmath10 is an arbitrary future - like vector with positive definite energy , and @xmath11 defines the sign in front of the @xmath12 prescription .",
    "this change of prescription , far from introducing additional difficulties , is essential for the consistency of the method .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "in general , the procedure for computing nlo cross - sections is to consider and integrate separately real and virtual corrections .",
    "however , with the fdu technique , it is possible to perform the summation over degenerate soft and collinear states from both contributions before integration , thanks to the use of a suitable mapping of momenta between real and virtual kinematics .",
    "this is achievable because the infrared ( ir ) singularities are located in a compact region of the loop three - momentum , therefore the cancellations occur locally and the introduction of ir subtraction terms is not needed . for a process at one loop with @xmath13 final state particles , we can write @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the renormalized virtual correction obtained using ltd and reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the @xmath4-leg scattering amplitude at leading order ( lo ) , while @xmath18 denotes the one - loop scattering amplitude , including the self - energy corrections of the external legs . the integral is then weighted by the measure function @xmath19 , used to define a given physical observable .",
    "similarly , the real correction reads @xmath20 where the external four - momenta @xmath21 , the phase - space and the tree - level scattering amplitude have been rewritten in terms of the loop three - momentum and the external momenta @xmath22 of the born process .",
    "+ although in dreg both ultraviolet ( uv ) and ir singularities are treated equally , in fdu they are considered separately .",
    "indeed , it is necessary to discriminate them in order to build a complete ltd representation of the virtual contributions , as explained in @xcite .",
    "+ the uv singularities are dealt with by introducing counter - terms for the mass and the wave - function at the integrand level .",
    "those counter - terms are calculated by expanding the unrenormalized amplitude around the uv propagator @xmath23 , then choosing a renormalization scheme and finally adjusting subleading terms in order to subtract the right finite pieces .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath24 scheme , this would be equivalent to make their integrated form in @xmath1 exhibit only an @xmath3 pole , i.e. no finite part .",
    "the counter - terms are process - independent and only depend on the nature of the particles involved , so it is only necessary to compute them once .",
    "more details about the uv renormalization within fdu can be found in @xcite . + ir singularities however , are more tricky to deal with .",
    "first , it is necessary to isolate each of them into different regions of the phase - space so that there is no more than one ir singularity of a given type  soft or ( quasi-)collinear  in a given region .",
    "then , for each region , one must apply to the real integrand a mapping that will make similar singular behaviors , for the virtual and the real contributions , match and therefore cancel each other locally .",
    "finally , both contributions can be added , as shown in equation ( [ sumrealvirtual ] ) , and the integration can be safely performed in 4 dimensions . + in the next section , we will apply the fdu technique to the three - point scalar function , and illustrate with a few expressions .",
    "let s consider a @xmath0 process at nlo with one massless internal state and the remaining internal and outgoing particles with mass equal to @xmath25 . to simplify the expressions , we define @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the final - state on - shell momenta are labeled as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the incoming one is @xmath33 with virtuality @xmath34 .",
    "we write the three internal momenta @xmath35 , and when they are on - shell , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "+ since the virtual decay - rate is given by @xmath40\\,,\\ ] ] we apply the ltd to @xmath41 .",
    "its dual representation then consists in the sum of the 3 following integrals : @xmath42 \\ , d[v_1]}{1-(1 - 2 v_1)^2 \\beta^2}~ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "i_2 & = & \\frac{2}{s_{12 } } \\int   \\frac{\\xi_{2}^2 \\ , d[\\xi_{2 } ] \\ , d[v_2]}{\\xi_{2,0 } \\ ,",

    "the real contributions are given by the interference terms , and are written as @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the normalized scalar product between @xmath47 and the radiated particle four - momentum @xmath48 . in equation  ( [ realdecayrate ] ) , we have applied the phase - space partition mentioned at the end of the previous section .",
    "explicitly , we define @xmath49 for @xmath50 . then , for each region , we introduce a suitable mapping between real and virtual kinematics .",
    "for instance , in region  1 we use @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 fulfilling @xmath54 .",
    "the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are computed by solving the on - shell conditions @xmath57 , their expressions can be found in @xcite .",
    "a similar transformation is used for region  2 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that these transformations fulfill two roles : they move the ir singularities to the same integration points in the dual domain , which allows them to cancel each other locally , and they are optimized to deal smoothly with the massless limit in each region . finally , after rewriting the real contributions in terms of the loop variables , we obtain @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 being the jacobians of the two transformations , @xmath61 and @xmath62 restricting the integration domain associated to their respective region , and @xmath63",
    ".     process with scalar particles , as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the dreg analytical result , while the dots are the numerical values obtained using fdu .",
    "the horizontal line represents the massless limit.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the sum of real and virtual contributions , i.e. the sum of equations  ( [ virtualdecayrate ] ) , ( [ gammatilde1toy ] ) and ( [ gammatilde2toy ] ) , gives the total decay - rate at nlo , @xmath64 , and is safely integrable in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the integration is done numerically , and is shown in figure [ plot ] .",
    "our results are compared with the analytical expression obtained using the dreg technique , and the agreement between the two approaches is very good .",
    "another advantage of the ltd approach is the smooth massless limit , thanks to the mapping being constructed to deal with quasi - collinear configurations .",
    "it is therefore possible to put @xmath13 to 0 before integration and still get the correct result .",
    "throughout this article , we generalized the fdu method to the massive case and applied it on the three - point scalar function . based on the ltd theorem , this technique allows to bypass dreg by expressing real and virtual contributions in terms of phase - space integrals , and adding them after splitting the integration domain and applying a mapping between the two kinematics in each of the different regions .",
    "this allows a safe four - dimensional integration , without the need to deal with @xmath3 poles , which makes the numerical computations easier and faster .",
