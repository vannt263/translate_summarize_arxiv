    "strong light confinement in photonic devices can enhance the light field intensity , and then lead to very strong light - matter interaction .",
    "the enhanced light field is essential for a wide range of applications , such as quantum electrodynamics @xcite , nonlinear optical effect @xcite , quantum optomechanics @xcite , optical sensors @xcite and nano - optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "therefore , the surface plasmon in metal nanostructures is attracting more and more attentions for its unique ability to confine light in the deep subwavelength scale .",
    "extreme strong field enhancements in surface plasmon are mainly attributed to the very small geometry size @xcite , sharp corners @xcite and nanoscale gaps @xcite , which has been stated in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , intrinsic loss due to internal damping of radiation in metal limits the explosion of practical applications .    for the case of dielectric , light is confined in the wavelength - scale photonic devices , with weak evanescent field interacting with outside .",
    "great efforts have been dedicated to enhance the light field intensity by engineering the dielectric structure . in 2004 , almeida et al .",
    "have proposed the dielectric slot waveguide structure , and demonstrated a very effective way to enhance the light field in the void @xcite .",
    "very recently , three - dimensional photonic crystal structure has been proposed to guide the light in the wedge - like waveguide with field enhanced at the apex @xcite .",
    "actually , the electric field enhancement in the vicinity of the dielectric corner is well known in electrostatics @xcite .",
    "while in the studies of electromagnetic waves , the corner effect is noticed because it may lead to diffraction at corners and computation difficulties in rectangle - cross - section waveguides @xcite .    in this paper , we numerically demonstrated the extremely local electric field enhancement and light confinement in dielectric waveguide by the corner and gap structures .",
    "the waveguide with fan - shaped cross - section is proposed to utilize the corner effect @xcite to enhance the local electric field , while the opposing apex - to - apex fan - shaped waveguides are studied to apply the gap effect @xcite . it is shown that the mode area can be as small as @xmath5 of diffraction limited area for practical geometry , superior to the confinement in hybrid surface plasmon waveguides @xcite . furthermore , we proposed a structure with dielectric bow - tie antenna on a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) waveguide to enhance the amplitude of electric field by one order .",
    "it is worth noting that the very sharp corner and closed gap give rise to singularity behavior of local field enhancement , which calls for theoretical efforts to study the quantum effects of dielectric at atomic scale @xcite .",

    "the behavior of @xmath55 against @xmath0 agrees well with that of @xmath39 ( fig .",

    "the trends of @xmath39 with different @xmath0 are the same , and show saturation for very small gap @xmath65 . for a fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "sharper corner gives rise to weaker light confinement in dielectric , which is consistent with the results of single fan - shaped waveguide ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) . for the mode areas",
    "( [ fig5](d ) ) , both @xmath37 and @xmath38 show great reduction when reducing the gap .",
    "these reveal that the slot structure leads to strong spatial confinement , as well as local field enhancement .",
    "however , @xmath38 is saturated when @xmath65 for @xmath66 , while @xmath37 is saturated only for @xmath67 .",
    "this indicates that the gap effect of apex - to - apex structure also depends on the sharpness of corners .    due to the combined effects of corner and gap structure",
    ", we found that @xmath37 can be as small as @xmath68 for @xmath69 nm and @xmath52 nm .",
    "compared to the best light confinement @xmath70 in the hybrid dielectric - metal surface plasmon waveguide @xcite , @xmath37 is @xmath71 times smaller .",
    "it is notable that the maximum of electric field is always located at the corner of waveguide , which is very suitable for light to interact with matters outside the dielectric .",
    "the extreme light confinement and local electric field enhancement in the dielectric corner and gap would benefit various applications , such as the waveguide quantum electrodynamics , nanoparticle trapping , and bio - sensors .",
    "from the tendency in fig .",
    "5(d ) , we can predict that the smaller effective mode area can be obtained by smaller gap or sharper corners .",
    "however , when the size of gap or corner structures is reduced to the atomic scale ( sub - nanometer ) , the classical electromagnetic theory will break down and the quantum mechanical effects appear in three aspects :    \\(1 ) the quantum size effect .",
    "the object with geometry smaller than atomic scale is meaningless .",
    "the sub - nanometer - scale geometry should be treated as atom cluster instead of regular corner or straight boundary . in the atomic scale ,",
    "the optical response of atomic clusters can not be deduced by the classical dielectric constant of bulk .",
    "\\(2 ) the non - local effect .",
    "the atomic - scale wave - function of electrons can spread out from the boundary .",
    "therefore , the response of the electron to electromagnetic wave is no longer local .",
    "\\(3 ) the quantum tunneling .",
    "when the gap between two apexes is sub - nanometer , the electrons may tunnel across the gap .",
    "therefore , the electromagnetic field theory for dielectric with zero conductivity is not valid .",
    "these quantum effects in metal nanostructures have been studied extensively recently both in experiments and theoretical studies @xcite . in theory , the optical responses of those structures at sub - nanometer scale are studied under quantum model with time - dependent density function theory @xcite , or under semiclassical model with modified electromagnetic theory by including hydrodynamic description of conducting electrons @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated that the singular behavior is avoided in those theoretical models and experiments .",
    "therefore , we could also expect the singular behavior to be removed by corrected models .",
    "however , the property of electrons in dielectric is significantly different from that in metal , so new models should be developed to study the optical response of the atomic scale dielectric structures .",
    "although the light confinement and local field enhancement may be limited by quantum effects , the apex - to - apex dielectric structure studied here is still superior to the plasmon waveguides : ( a ) optical modes in the apex - to - apex fan waveguides are lossless , which is an incomparable advantage over plasmonic waveguides where light confinement is realized at the cost of huge intrinsic loss in the metal .",
    "( b ) even for the case of @xmath64 and @xmath48 where the classical maxwell equations are valid , we get @xmath72 which is smaller than that of hybrid plasmonic waveguide @xcite .",
    "of the dielectric bow - tie antenna .",

    "the corner and gap effects have been demonstrated above for dielectric waveguides with different cross - section geometry , where light propagates perpendicularly to the cross - section .",
    "now , we turn to study the field enhancement in the dielectric bow - tie ( dbt ) antenna structure , where the corner and gap structures are not uniform along the waveguide .",
    "this dbt antenna can be integrated with various photonic structures , such as waveguide and microring , and is very potential for practical applications .    as shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) , a dielectric bow - tie antenna is placed on a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) waveguide with rectangle cross - section of @xmath75 .",
    "the bow - tie antenna consists of two opposing apex - to - apex silicon isosceles triangles , the height and thickness of which are denoted as @xmath74 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the vertex angle of the nano - triangle is @xmath77 , and the radius of the round is @xmath48 . due to the effects of corner and gap",
    ", we can expect a strongly enhanced field in the gap of the dbt antenna . to investigate the field enhancement ,",
    "the three - dimensional model with @xmath78 fundamental te - polarized mode loaded in the waveguide is simulated numerically . from the field profiles in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) , the electric field is greatly enhanced in the gap of dbt antenna compared to that in the waveguide .",
    "note that the corner and gap effects can only be expected for the electric field along the axis of symmetry of the corner , and there is no field enhancement for the tm - polarized mode .    in fig .",
    "6(d ) , the maximum of @xmath21 at the center of the gap of dbt antenna is plotted as a function of @xmath74 for @xmath79 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the evanescent field of the fundamental te mode at the top surface of the waveguide without dbt antenna is also shown by the dashed line .",
    "we can find that the maximum of @xmath21 is enhanced by @xmath80 and @xmath81 times for @xmath79 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "in both cases , the enhancement factor is insensitive to @xmath74 .",
    "the narrower gap leads to the stronger electric field enhancement , which is consistent with the results in the apex - to - apex fan waveguides .",
    "the dbt antenna is easy for fabrication and compatible with cmos technology , thus it will be useful as building blocks in integrated photonic circuits .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate the corner- and gap - enhanced local electric field in dielectric waveguide . as an example , in opposing apex - to - apex fan - shaped waveguides with @xmath2 , the mode area of fundamental wedge mode can be as small as @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , far beyond the diffraction limit .",
    "the numerical results indicate that the field enhancement and confinement abilities increase with decreasing radius of rounded corner ( @xmath0 ) and gap ( @xmath1 ) , and show singularity for infinitesimal @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the singularity behavior calls for theoretical efforts to study the quantum effects of dielectric at atomic scale .",
    "furthermore , we propose a structure with dielectric bow - tie antenna on a silicon - on - insulator waveguide , the field enhancement of which is improved by one order .",
    "although the waveguide studied in this paper is focused at @xmath82 nm , we should be aware that the corner and gap effects are broadband .",
    "the lossless dielectric corner and gap structures offer an alternative method to enhance the light - matter interaction without metal nano - structure , and will find applications in quantum electrodynamics , sensors and nano - particle trapping .",
