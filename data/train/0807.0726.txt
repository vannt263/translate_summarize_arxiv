    "at present considerable attention is given to the study of two - component bose - einstein condensates .",

    ", they are considered as objects in which some cosmological and astrophysical processes can be modelled @xcite . in two component systems",
    "the superfluid components may flow with different velocities .",
    "in such a situation an unusual ( nondissipative ) kind of the drag effect takes place @xcite .",
    "it makes possible to create a controlled phase difference between two bose - condensates placed in a two - well potential , and to observe effects @xcite , similar to ones that occur in superconductive systems with josephson contacts in magnetic fields . in this article",
    "we study a related problem , namely , the critical velocities in a two component superfluid system with components flowing with different velocities .",
    "according to the landau criterion , the critical velocity in a single - component condensate is determined by the expression @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the excitation spectrum in an immovable condensate and @xmath5 is the wave number .",
    "the velocity is given in the frame of reference connected with walls or obstacles .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can be applied to a two - component condensate only in the case when both components move with the same velocity .",
    "the landau criterium can be reformulated as the requirement of positivity of energies of elementary excitations in the frame of reference , connected with walls or obstacles .",
    "these energies depend on the velocities of the components @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( in the same frame of reference ) , and the landau criterium should yield some joint condition on @xmath6 and @xmath8 .    to find the energy of elementary excitations",
    "we use the gross - pitaevskii equation for the two - component system @xmath9 are the masses of the particles , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the interaction constants ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the scattering lengths ) .",
    "the wave function of the component can be represented as the sum of the stationary part and the fluctuating part @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "the stationary part of the condensate wave function can be presented in the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the chemical potentials of the components .",
    "the gradients of the phases @xmath19 are connected with the superfluid velocities by the relation @xmath20 .",
    "the fluctuating part can be written as @xmath21 .",

    ".    for @xmath27 the equation ( [ 16 ] ) yields @xmath28 in this study we assume that the condition of stability of a two - component condensate relative to phase separation is fulfilled ( @xmath29 ) .    the requirement of positivity of ( [ 18 ] ) at all @xmath30 is equivalent to the condition ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this condition yields the following expression for the critical velocity @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the bare velocities of the sound modes for the components ( in the absence of interaction between the components ) .    in a general case @xmath33",
    "the landau criterium requires the existence of two positive solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) at all @xmath30 .",
    "this requirement is equivalent to the following two inequalities : @xmath34 [ e_2 ^ 2 - ( \\hbar \\mathbf{v}_2\\cdot \\mathbf{k})^2 ] - 4 \\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_2 \\gamma_{12}^2",
    "n_1 n_2 > 0,\\ ] ] @xmath35 the critical values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 correspond to the case , when the inequality ( [ 30 ] ) turnes into the equality at least for one @xmath30 . in the case",
    "considered the sufficient condition for fulfilling the inequalities ( [ 30 ] ) , ( [ 31 ] ) for all @xmath30 is their fulfillment at @xmath36 for all directions of @xmath30 , complanar to @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the inequalities ( [ 30 ] ) , ( [ 31 ] ) can be replaced with the system of inequalities @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is an angle between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , and @xmath39 is an angle between @xmath30 and @xmath6 ) , that should be fulfilled for all @xmath39 .",
    "the results of the analysis of ( [ 20 ] ) is given in fig.1    if the components move in the same direction their critical velocities are related by the equation @xmath40 with the additional condition @xmath41 . according to ( [ 112 ] ) only for @xmath42",
    "the critical velocity coincides with the velocity of the lowest hydrodynamic mode @xmath0 . in a general case one of the velocities",
    "may exceed @xmath0 ( the second velocity should be less than @xmath0 ) . if one of the components does not move the velocity of the other component may reach the maximum value @xmath43    one can see from fig.1 that at @xmath44 both components may move with velocities that exceed @xmath0 . under the motion of the components in mutually perpendicular directions ( @xmath45 ) the velocities can simultaneously reach the maximum critical values ( [ 113 ] ) .    here",
    "we do not consider the possibility of excitation of vortices .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , our analysis yields only the upper bound for the critical velocities .",
    "nevertheless , in a number of situations the estimation for the critical velocities presented in this paper is justified completely .",
    "for example , this occurs when the superfluid flows past an obstacle with a small ( less than the healing length ) linear size @xcite .",
    "in bose gases confined in optical or magnetic traps surface excitations have the minimum phase velocity @xcite . in such systems the process of generating of vortices is connected with the excitation of surface modes , and the critical velocity coincides with the phase velocity of the lowest surface mode @xcite .    let us study the critical velocities for a two - component bose gas , confined in a harmonic cylindrical potential @xmath46 .",
    "we will consider the case when superfluid flows are directed along @xmath47 .",
    "for simplicity we assume @xmath48 ( @xmath49 - radial coordinate ) , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "let us consider the system whose thomas- fermi radius @xmath53^{1/2}$ ] is much large than the oscillator length of the trap . to find the spectrum of elementary excitations we pass from the gross -pitaevskii equation to the linearized system of hydrodynamic equations for the densities @xmath54 and the velocities @xmath55 of the components : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the equilibrium density of the components ( @xmath58 is the density in the center of trap ) , @xmath59 are their superfluid velocities and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the fluctuations of these values .",
    "the modes we are interested in are localized near the surface and the problem considered can be reduced to the problem for the spectrum of excitations in a bose gas in a linear potential @xcite . with this simplification",
    "we obtain the following dispersion equation @xmath62 \\left [ ( \\omega - k v_2)^2 - \\frac{2\\gamma n_0 k}{m r_{\\mathrm{tf}}}\\right ] -   \\frac{4 \\gamma_{12}^2 n_0 ^ 2 k^2}{m^2 r_{\\mathrm{tf}}^2}= 0.\\ ] ] the region of the applicability of ( [ 24 ] ) is bounded from above by the condition @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the wave vector for which the contributions of kinetic and potential energies to the excitation energy become comparable . the value of @xmath64 can be estimated by equating the kinetic energy of the particles @xmath65 to the energy of the lowest mode ( in the hydrodynamic limit ) @xmath66^{1/2}$ ] what gives @xmath67{\\displaystyle \\frac{m n_0(\\gamma-\\gamma_{12})}{\\hbar^2 r_{\\mathrm{tf}}}}$ ] . at the point",
    "@xmath68 the dependence of the excitation energy on @xmath5 has a bend and the critical velocity can be estimated by substituting of @xmath69 into the equation ( [ 24 ] ) .    as it follows from ( [ 24 ] ) for @xmath70 the critical velocity is the minimum phase velocity of the lowest surface mode @xmath71 if only one component moves , the critical velocity reaches the value @xmath72 thus , the highest velocity can be reached when only one component flows .",
    "in conclusion , let us discuss a number of possibilities to observe the predicted behavior .",
    "one of them is to create barriers not penetrable for one of the components .",
    "if in the absence of the barriers the components move with equal velocities the appearance of such barriers may increase of the critical velocity .",
    "the motion of the components with different velocities ( and in different directions ) can also be realized in systems , in which the components are separated spatially , for example , in a bilayer geometry ( in that case a long - range interaction between the components is required for observing the effect predicted ) .",
    "the effect is also may be observed in multilayer condensates of electron - hole pairs which can appear in semiconducting heterostructures with an even ( @xmath73 ) number of two - dimensional electron layers @xcite . in electron - hole condensates",
    "the critical velocities can be easily measured since they are proportional to the value of critical currents ."
