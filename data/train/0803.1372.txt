    "biological macroevolution has attracted much interest , not only among biologists , but also among physicists , because it is a highly nonlinear , far - from - equilibrium , complex interacting system .",
    "recently , one of the authors proposed a series of individual - based biological coevolution models and studied their long - term statistical properties @xcite .",
    "it was found that some properties are observed universally for various models .",
    "one such property is an approximate @xmath0 power spectral density ( psd ) for the diversities ( i.e. , number of species ) .",
    "the models display intermittency in their time series : relatively quiet periods are interrupted by active periods during which the community is rearranged . during the quiet periods ,",
    "the system is considered to be in a quasi - steady state ( qss ) .",
    "the @xmath0 fluctuations are so robust that one is reminded of the concept of a universality class in critical phenomena .",
    "a naturally emerging question is whether this @xmath0 mode is unique in evolving systems . in this short article , we report the existence of another mode . in that class ,",
    "diversities and total population sizes show @xmath1 psds , i.e. , indicating random - walk like fluctuations .",
    "the models we use in this article are modified versions of individual - based coevolution models .",
    "the original individual - based models have a stochastic population dynamics with discrete , non - overlapping generations .",
    "each species is represented by a bit - string genome of length @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath2-bit genome supplies a pool of @xmath3 possible species . at the end of every generation ,",
    "individuals of species @xmath4 give rise to @xmath5 offspring before they die with the reproduction probability @xmath6 .",
    "this depends on the population sizes @xmath7 of all the species present in the community at that time . with probability @xmath8 , the individual dies without offspring .",
    "the fecundity @xmath5 is taken as a constant , independent of @xmath4 and @xmath9 for simplicity . in each generation , the genomes of the offspring mutate with probability @xmath10 per gene and individual .",
    "mutation is the origin of diversity , which is necessary for the evolutionary process .",
    "thus all @xmath7 are updated stochastically at the same time .    in this article , instead of",
    "individual - based population dynamics , we consider a stochastic difference equation to explicitly test the effect of stochasticity at the population level . in the case of individual - based models ,",
    "the populations at @xmath11 follow a binomial distribution with mean @xmath12 and variance @xmath13 .",
    "we here approximate this process by replacing the binomial distribution by a gaussian distribution .",
    "populations of continuous variables are updated by the following stochastic difference equation : @xmath14 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are parameters giving the noise level and a random number drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath17 and standard deviation @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the first and the second term in the equation represent the mean and fluctuation of the number of individuals in generation @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "when the noise coefficient @xmath19 , the model has the same mean and standard deviation as the corresponding individual - based model .",
    "the model is then a good approximation for an individual - based model .",
    "populations tend to go to their equilibrium values , but fluctuate around them .",
    "this fluctuation may be critical , especially for species with tiny populations .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath20 , the population dynamics becomes deterministic ; the system converges to a fixed point and does not fluctuate after it reaches its fixed point . in this limit , a species can survive as long as it has a positive fixed point , even when its equilibrium population is quite low .",
    "extinction of species is introduced by defining a threshold value , @xmath21 . a species whose population becomes less than @xmath22",
    "is considered to go extinct and is removed from the system . in each generation",
    ", mutations happen after the population updates with a probability of @xmath10 per gene .",
    "the number of individuals is obtained by rounding off @xmath23 .",
    "the reproduction probability is given by @xmath24 } } .\\ ] ] when @xmath25 is large , species can almost certainly give rise to offspring ; while they tend to die without offspring when @xmath25 is small .",
    "we use two forms of @xmath25 , called model a and model b. model a was introduced in @xcite . in this model",
    ", @xmath25 has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denote the interaction coefficient between @xmath4 and @xmath30 , the total population @xmath31 , and the environmental carrying capacity , respectively . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_i_a ] ) limits the total population to a finite value .",
    "all the off - diagonal elements of the interaction matrix @xmath27 are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution over @xmath32 $ ] , while the diagonal elements @xmath33 are set to @xmath17 .    in model",
    "b , @xmath25 is @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the reproduction cost and the ability to utilize the external resource for species @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the external resource is represented by @xmath37 , which remains constant .",
    "the birth costs @xmath35 are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution over @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "a certain proportion of species ( @xmath39 ) has the ability to utilize the external resource .",
    "thus @xmath36 is positive only for these species , and it is then drawn from a uniform distribution over @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "other species have @xmath40 .",
    "the interaction matrix is limited to anti - symmetric form @xmath41 , and it is non - zero with a certain connectance probability ( here , @xmath42 ) .",
    "each off - diagonal @xmath27 is selected from a triangular distribution over @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the diagonal elements are distributed uniformly over @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations and calcualted the psds of the diversity and the total population .",
    "we used the diversity measure known in ecology as the shannon - wiener diversity , which is defined as the exponential of the information - theoretical entropy of the population distribution @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "since there are many kinds of species with tiny populations that are mostly unsuccessful mutants , this measure of diversity is useful to filter out the corresponding noise .    for model",
    "a , we performed 12 independent runs for each noise level .",
    "each simulation run was performed for a long period of @xmath48 generations with an initializing period of @xmath49 generations .",
    "the simulation parameters were @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "results for several noise levels are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_a ] .",
    "it shows approximate @xmath0 behavior , regardless of the noise level .",
    "however , a crossover to white noise is seen in the low - frequency range for strong noise , indicating the appearance of a characteristic time scale .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 intermittency is robust against the change in noise level in this model .    for model b",
    ", we performed 6 independent runs for each parameter .",
    "simulations were performed for @xmath54 generations plus a @xmath55 generations initial  warm - up \" period .",
    "the parameters were @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_b ] .",
    "in contrast to model a , model b exhibits psds that depend on the noise level .",
    "when the noise is strong enough , they show approximate @xmath0 fluctuations in a similar manner as the individual - based model .",
    "however , as the noise weakens , the exponents of the psds approach @xmath60 ; and eventually they show @xmath1 like behavior in the noiseless limit .",
    "the exponents change not suddenly but gradually .",
    "a psd with @xmath1 behavior means that the quantities change like random walks , suggesting gradual changes of the species configurations .",
    "in this short article , we studied the effects of stochastic population fluctuations for two models of biological evolution .",
    "it was found that @xmath1 psds of diversity and total population sizes may appear in model b , while @xmath0 psds are robustly found for model a. the evolving food webs in model b show not only @xmath0 , but also @xmath1 behavior , depending on the level of the stochastic population fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the species configurations for model b in the noiseless limit change gradually rather than intermittently , indicating the absence of qss .",
    "it is desirable to analyze the noise sensitivity of model b in further detail to clarify the origin of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluctuations .",
    "for example , distributions of the lifetime of species or durations of qss should provide further information .",
    "other forms of population dynamics including more simplistic ones @xcite and realistic ones @xcite have also been suggested .",
    "comparison with these forms is a promising way to confirm the robustness of the results shown in this article .",
