    "the perturbative approach is a fundamental tool of investigation in general relativity , where exact solutions are most often too idealized to properly represent the realm of natural phenomena .",
    "unfortunately , it has long been known that the invariance of general relativity under diffeomorphisms ( two solutions of the einstein equation are physically equivalent if they are diffeomorphic to each other ) makes the very definition of perturbations gauge dependent @xcite .",
    "a gauge choice is an identification between points of the perturbed and the background spacetimes , and generic perturbations are not invariant under a gauge transformation .",
    "this `` gauge problem '' has been widely treated in linear theory , but what if one wants to consider higher order perturbations ?",
    "in particular , how do the latter change under a gauge transformation ?",
    "second order treatments have been recently proposed , both in cosmology @xcite and compact object theory @xcite , as a way of obtaining more accurate results to be compared with present and future observations .",
    "for example , in view of the increased sensitivity expected from the next generation of detectors , precise computations of microwave background anisotropies or gravitational wave production may require going beyond the linear regime .",
    "in addition , second order perturbations provide a reliable measure of the accuracy of the linearized theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in cosmology ,",
    "a second ( or higher ) order treatment might prove necessary when dealing with scales much smaller than the cosmological horizon , where the linear approximation can either be not accurate enough or just miss some physical effects .",
    "finally , general relativity is an intrinsically non - linear theory , thus it is in principle interesting to look at higher order perturbations as a tool for exploring non - linear features .",
    "unfortunately , already the second order calculations are almost invariably a computational _ tour de force _ , and a gauge - invariant treatment is not at hand . as a matter of fact , the computationally more convenient gauge does not necessarily coincide with the most interesting one , and often different authors work in different gauges , but at present a general formalism to deal with second and higher order gauge transformations is not available in the literature , although some partial results can be found in @xcite and in @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to fill this gap .",
    "thus , while we shall consider the problem of gauge transformations from a general geometrical perspective , from the practical point of view our main goal is to derive the effect on a tensor field @xmath1 of a second order gauge transformation . to this end , we shall show that the latter is necessarily represented in coordinates by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two independent vector fields , and that , under ( [ eq : t ] ) , the first and second order perturbations of @xmath1 transform as @xmath5 equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) is the usual first order result in terms of the lie derivative of the background tensor field @xmath6 along the vector field @xmath3 , and the second order perturbation @xmath7 is defined by ( [ deltat1 ] ) and ( [ deltakt ] ) .",
    "in fact , we derive a general formula , equation ( [ lemma2applied ] ) , from which the gauge transformations to an arbitrary order @xmath0 can be deduced , although we will give the explicit expression only for transformations up to third order .",
    "furthermore , we show that a tensor field @xmath1 is gauge - invariant to second order if and only if it is gauge - invariant to first order , i.e. , @xmath8 for an arbitrary vector field @xmath9 , and , in addition , @xmath10 actually , we generalize the above result giving a condition for gauge invariance to an arbitrary order @xmath0 .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in the next section we give some mathematical results concerning the taylor expansion of tensor fields under the action of one - parameter families ( not necessarily groups ) of diffeomorphisms .",
    "this material is necessary for the applications to follow ; however ,",
    "the reader interested only in the latter can skip all the proofs , as well as the last two paragraphs of section [ seciib ] ; section [ seciid ] is useful if one wants to translate our results in the language of coordinates . in section 3",
    "we give a general discussion of spacetime perturbations and gauge choices , giving in particular a precise definition of the @xmath11-th order perturbation of a general tensor field . in section 4",
    "we first define total gauge invariance and gauge invariance to order @xmath0 ; then we give the generating formula for a gauge transformation to an arbitrary order , and explicit rules for second and third order transformations . in section 5",
    "we consider perturbations of a flat robertson  walker model , and apply our results to the case of the transformations between two specific gauge choices , i.e. , the synchronous @xcite and the poisson @xcite gauges .",
    "section 6 contains a final discussion .    in general , we shall work on an @xmath12-dimensional lorentzian manifold of signature .",
    "the abstract mathematical notation is used extensively , but sometimes we shall make reference to charts ; in this case , coordinate indices @xmath13 take values from 0 to @xmath14 .",
    "units are such that @xmath15 . furthermore , for the sake of simplicity we shall always suppose that manifolds , maps , tensor fields , etc . , are as smooth as necessary , or even analytic ( see @xcite for an extension to @xmath16 fields ) .",
    "before considering the specific problem of gauge transformations in relativistic perturbation theory we need to establish some general results concerning the taylor expansion of tensor fields , to be used later . for functions on @xmath17 ,",
    "a taylor expansion is essentially a convenient way to express the value of the function at some point in terms of its value , and the value of all its derivatives , at another point .",
    "of course , this is impossible for a tensor field @xmath1 on a manifold @xmath18 , simply because @xmath19 and @xmath20 at different points @xmath21 and @xmath22 belong to different spaces , and can not thus be directly compared . a taylor expansion can therefore be written only if one is given a mapping between tensors at different points of @xmath18 . in this section ,",
    "we study the case in which such a mapping arises from a one - parameter _ family _ of diffeomorphisms of @xmath18 , starting from the simplest case of a flow ( i.e. , a one - parameter _ group _ of diffeomorphisms ) and then proceeding to generalize it .",
    "let us first establish some notation .",
    "let @xmath23 be a diffeomorphism between two manifolds @xmath18 and @xmath24 .",
    "for each @xmath25 , @xmath26 defines naturally the linear map @xmath27 between the tangent spaces , called _ push - forward _ , and the linear map @xmath28 between the cotangent spaces , called the _ pull - back_. using @xmath29 , we can define also a push - forward of @xmath30 on @xmath31 , and a pull - back of @xmath32 on @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 turn out to be well - defined for tensors of arbitrary type .",
    "we can also construct maps @xmath36 and @xmath37 for tensor fields , simply requiring that , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 hereafter , we drop the suffixes in @xmath34 and @xmath35 , since there is no real danger of confusion .",
    "let @xmath41 be a differentiable manifold , and let @xmath9 be a vector field on @xmath41 , generating a flow @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44",
    ". defines global transformations of @xmath18 @xcite . ] for any given @xmath45 ,",
    "we shall write , following the common usage , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . let @xmath1 be a tensor field on @xmath41 .",
    "the map @xmath48 defines a new field @xmath49 on @xmath41 , the pull - back of @xmath1 , which is thus a function of @xmath50 . + * lemma 1 : * the field @xmath49 admits the following expansion around @xmath51 : @xmath52    * proof : * by analyticity we have @xmath53 where , here and in the following , @xmath54_{\\lambda=\\tau}\\;,\\ ] ] and the first derivative is , by definition , just the lie derivative of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath9 : @xmath55 in order to prove ( [ lemma1 ] ) , it is then sufficient to show that , @xmath56 , @xmath57 this can be established by induction over @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that ( [ ? ? ] ) is true for some @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and we have used the property that @xmath60 forms a one - parameter group : @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 + it is worth noticing that ( [ lemma1 ] ) can also be written @xcite in the symbolic form @xmath63",
    ".    equation ( [ lemma1 ] ) can be applied to the special case in which the tensor @xmath1 is just one of the coordinate functions on @xmath18 , @xmath64 .",
    "we have then , since @xmath65 , the usual action of an `` infinitesimal point transformation '' extended to second order in @xmath50 : @xmath66 where we have denoted @xmath67 simply by @xmath64 , and @xmath68 by @xmath69 .",
    "let us now suppose that there are _ two _ vector fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 on @xmath41 . separately",
    ", they generate the flows @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . we can combine @xmath70 and @xmath71 to define a new one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms @xmath72 , whose action is given by @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 displaces a point of @xmath41 a parameter interval @xmath50 along the integral curve of @xmath3 , and then an interval @xmath75 along the integral curve of @xmath4 ( see figure [ fig : knight ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we shall call it , with a chess - inspired terminology , a _ knight diffeomorphism .",
    "_    this concept can be immediately generalized to the case in which @xmath0 vector fields @xmath76 are defined on @xmath41 , corresponding to the flows @xmath77 .",
    "then we define a one - parameter family @xmath78 of knight diffeomorphisms of rank @xmath0 by @xmath79 and the vector fields @xmath76 will be called the _ generators _ of @xmath80 .",
    "of course , @xmath81 ; consequently , lemma 1 can not be applied if we want to expand in @xmath50 the pull - back @xmath82 of a tensor field @xmath1 defined on @xmath41 .",
    "however , the result can be easily generalized . + * lemma 2 : * the pull - back @xmath82 of a tensor field @xmath1 by a one - parameter family of knight diffeomorphisms @xmath80 with generators @xmath83 can be expanded around @xmath51 as follows : @xmath84    * proof : * @xmath85 where we have repeatedly used ( [ lemma1]).@xmath62 + the explicit form of ( [ lemma2 ] ) up to the third order in @xmath50 is @xmath86    equations ( [ lemma2 ] ) and ( [ lemma2explic ] ) apply to a one - parameter family of knight diffeomorphisms of arbitrarily high rank , and can be specialized to the particular case of rank @xmath0 simply by setting @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "their meaning is particularly clear in a chart .",
    "denoting , as before , by @xmath64 the coordinates of a point @xmath21 , and by @xmath69 those of @xmath89 , we have , to order @xmath90 , @xmath91 equation ( [ lemma2coord ] ) is represented pictorially in figure [ fig : chart ] .    since @xmath81 , and @xmath92",
    ", one may reasonably doubt that @xmath80 forms a group , except under very special conditions .",
    "this is confirmed by the following + * theorem 1 : * the only cases in which @xmath80 forms a group are those for which @xmath93 , @xmath94 , with @xmath95 arbitrary numerical coefficients .",
    "then , under the reparametrization @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , @xmath80 reduces to a flow in the canonical form . +",
    "* proof : * let us first show that @xmath93 , @xmath94 , is a sufficient condition for @xmath80 to be a group .",
    "since lemma 1 implies @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 .",
    "thus , ( i ) @xmath100 , with @xmath101 , and ( ii ) @xmath102 , with @xmath103 .    to prove the reverse implication ,",
    "let us consider first the case of a knight diffeomorphism of rank two .",
    "if @xmath80 has to form a group , then for any @xmath104 , there must exist a @xmath105 such that @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 applying lemma 1 to ( [ o ] ) we get , to second order in the parameters and for an arbitrary tensor @xmath1 , @xmath108 in the limit @xmath109 , one gets from ( [ 00 ] ) that @xmath110 , where @xmath111 are unspecified numerical coefficients .",
    "substituting back into ( [ 00 ] ) we have that @xmath112 it is clear that ( [ ? ] ) can be satisfied only if @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "similarly , considering higher rank knight diffeomorphisms , one can show that @xmath93 , @xmath115.@xmath62 + the failure of @xmath80 to form a group is also related to the following circumstance .",
    "for any @xmath25 , one can define a curve @xmath116 by @xmath117 .",
    "however , these curves do not form a congruence on @xmath18 .",
    "for the point @xmath118 , say , belongs to the image of the curve @xmath119 , but also to the one of @xmath120 , which differs from @xmath119 when at least one of the @xmath121 is not collinear with @xmath3 , since @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the fundamental property of a congruence , that each point of @xmath18 lies on the image of one , and only one , curve , is violated .    finally , it is perhaps worth pointing out that the result of lemma 2 _ can not _ be written , even formally , as @xmath123 with @xmath124 because this expression fails to agree with ( [ lemma2 ] ) for @xmath125 . one might try to define a vector @xmath126 for which an analog of ( [ diopoi ] ) holds , but this does not seem very useful or illuminating .",
    "knight diffeomorphisms are of a very peculiar form , and the previous results seem therefore of limited applicability .",
    "this is , however , not the case , because any one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms can always be regarded as a one - parameter family of knight diffeomorphisms  of infinite rank , in general  as shown by the following + * theorem 2 : * let @xmath127 be a one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms . then @xmath128 @xmath129 one - parameter groups of diffeomorphisms of @xmath18 , such that @xmath130    * proof : * consider the action of @xmath74 on a function @xmath131 . a taylor expansion of @xmath132 gives @xmath133 the differential operator @xmath134 defined by @xmath135 is clearly a derivative , so we can define a vector @xmath3 through @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , @xmath137 is also a derivative , as one can easily check .",
    "thus , we define the vector @xmath4 such that @xmath138 , and so on at higher orders .",
    "hence , we recover ( [ lemma2 ] ) for an arbitrary @xmath139 .",
    "but if @xmath26 and @xmath140 are two diffeomorphisms on @xmath18 such that @xmath141 for every @xmath139 , it follows that @xmath142 , as it is easy to see .",
    "thus , we establish ( [ theorem]).@xmath62 + it must be noticed that , although we have supposed so far that maps and fields are analytic , it is possible to give versions of lemmas 1 and 2 , and of theorem 2 , that hold in the case of @xmath16 objects @xcite .",
    "the main change is the substitution of taylor series like the one in ( [ lemma1 ] ) by a finite sum of @xmath143 terms plus a remainder @xcite .",
    "the meaning of theorem 2 is then that any one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms can be approximated by a family of knight diffeomorphisms of suitable rank .",
    "the abstract mathematical notation that we have used so far is the most appropriate one for the study of gauge transformations in perturbation theory from a general point of view . in order to make explicit calculations in special cases of physical interest , however",
    ", one must introduce a chart .",
    "most of the literature on the subject , therefore , is written in the language of coordinates .",
    "for this reason , we indicate here how to establish a correspondence between the two formalisms . for the sake of simplicity in the notation ,",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to consider the action of the pull - back on a vector field , the extension to one - forms and tensors of higher rank being straightforward .",
    "let therefore @xmath144 be a chart of @xmath18 , with @xmath145 an open set and @xmath146 given by @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "since the function @xmath149 is differentiable , we can define the linear map @xmath150 , that associates to a vector on @xmath18 its @xmath151-th component in the coordinate basis defined by the chart @xmath144 .. ]    consider now a vector field @xmath152 and its pull - back @xmath153 , which for every value of @xmath50 is a new vector field on @xmath18 .",
    "for each point @xmath154 , the components of @xmath155 in the chart @xmath144 are @xmath156 which becomes , using ( [ phi^ * ] ) and the definition of @xmath157 , @xmath158    now , let us define a new chart @xmath159 , with @xmath160 . in this way ,",
    "the @xmath161-coordinates of the point @xmath162 coincide with the @xmath163-coordinates of the point @xmath21 from which @xmath22 has come under the action of the diffeomorphism : @xmath164 .",
    "we have then @xmath165    denoting by @xmath166 and @xmath167 the components of @xmath152 in the charts @xmath144 and @xmath159 , respectively , we can then write @xmath168_{x(q ) }   z^\\nu(x(q))\\;. \\label{coord - vector}\\ ] ] that is , the pull - back of @xmath152 is characterized by having , in the chart @xmath144 at point @xmath21 , the same components that the original vector field has in the chart @xmath159 at point @xmath169 . or , since @xmath170 , one can just write @xmath171 , where @xmath163 simply stands for a point of @xmath17 .",
    "this property can also be used to _ define _ @xmath157 , and corresponds to a _ passive _ interpretation of the map @xmath74 , regarded as generating a change in the chart _ on _ @xmath18 rather than a transformation _ of _ @xmath18 ( _ active _ view ) . of course , the two viewpoints are equivalent @xcite , but the active interpretation is much less confusing .",
    "we end this section by writing down the explicit expression , up to second order in @xmath50 , for the coordinate transformation @xmath172 associated to a family of diffeomorphisms with generators @xmath173 .",
    "calling @xmath162 , we have from ( [ lemma2coord ] ) , @xmath174 by definition , we have also @xmath175 expanding the various quantities on the right hand side around @xmath22 , ( [ gosh ] ) becomes finally @xmath176 equations ( [ lemma2coord ] ) and ( [ lemma2coord  ] ) express the relationship , in the language of coordinates , between the active and the passive views . whereas ( [ lemma2coord ] ) provides us with the coordinates , in the _ same chart _",
    "@xmath144 , of the _ different points _ @xmath21 and @xmath169 , equation ( [ lemma2coord  ] ) gives the transformation law between the coordinates of the _ same point _",
    "@xmath22 in the two _ different charts _ @xmath144 and @xmath159 .",
    "an equivalent form of the transformation ( [ lemma2coord  ] ) was already used by taub in studying the gauge dependence of an approximate stress energy tensor for gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "using ( [ lemma2coord  ] ) for the actual computation of the coordinate transformation in ( [ coord - vector ] ) , and expanding every term again at second order around @xmath177 , one can derive the components in the chart @xmath144 of the pull - back @xmath178 of @xmath152 , given in terms of a second order expansion formula involving @xmath152 and its partial derivatives along @xmath3 and @xmath4 . then",
    ", properly collecting the various terms , one can check that this leads to the components of the right hand side of ( [ lemma2explic ] ) , i.e. , to the components of a taylor expansion of @xmath179 in terms of the lie derivatives along @xmath3 and @xmath4 of @xmath152 .",
    "in relativistic perturbation theory one tries to find approximate solutions of the einstein equation , regarding them as `` small '' deviations from some known exact solution  the so - called background .",
    "the perturbation @xmath180 in any relevant quantity , say represented by a tensor field @xmath1 , is defined as the difference between the value @xmath1 has in the physical spacetime , and the background value @xmath6 . however , it is a basic fact of differential geometry that , in order to make the comparison of tensors meaningful at all , one has to consider them at the same point . since @xmath1 and @xmath6 are defined in different spacetimes , they can thus be compared only after a prescription for identifying points of these spacetimes is given .",
    "gauge choice _ is precisely this , i.e. , a map between the background and the physical spacetime .",
    "mathematically , any diffeomorphism between the two spacetimes provides one such prescription .",
    "a change of this diffeomorphism is then a gauge transformation , and the freedom one has in choosing it corresponds to the arbitrariness in the value of the perturbation of @xmath1 at any given spacetime point , unless @xmath1 is gauge - invariant .",
    "this is the essence of the `` gauge problem , '' which has been discussed in depth in many papers @xcite and review articles @xcite .    in order to discuss higher order perturbations and gauge transformations , and to define gauge invariance",
    ", we must formalize the previous ideas , giving a precise description of what perturbations and gauge choices are . here",
    "we shall mainly follow the approach used in references @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "let us thus consider a family of spacetime models @xmath181 , where the metric @xmath182 and the matter fields ( here collectively referred to as @xmath183 ) satisfy the field equation @xmath184=0\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath45 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath182 and @xmath183 depend smoothly on the parameter @xmath50 , so that @xmath50 itself is a measure of the amount by which a specific @xmath185 differs from the idealized background solution @xmath186 , which is supposed to be known . in some applications ,",
    "@xmath50 is a dimensionless parameter naturally arising from the physical problem one is dealing with . in this case one",
    "expects the perturbative solution to accurately approximate the exact one for reasonably small @xmath50 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in other problems , @xmath50 can be introduced as a purely formal parameter , and in the end , for convenience , one can thus choose @xmath187 for the physical spacetime , as we shall do in section 5 .",
    "this situation is most naturally described by introducing an @xmath188-dimensional manifold @xmath24 , foliated by submanifolds diffeomorphic to @xmath18 , so that @xmath189 .",
    "we shall label each copy of @xmath18 by the corresponding value of the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the manifold @xmath24 has a natural differentiable structure which is the direct product of those of @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "we can then choose charts in which @xmath64 ( @xmath192 ) are coordinates on each leave @xmath193 , and @xmath194 .",
    "now , if a tensor field @xmath195 is given on each @xmath193 , we have that a tensor field @xmath1 is automatically defined on @xmath196 by the relation @xmath197 , with @xmath198",

    "this is easily accomplished by assigning a diffeomorphism @xmath203 such that @xmath204 .",
    "clearly , @xmath205 can be regarded as the member of a flow @xmath26 on @xmath24 , corresponding to the value @xmath50 of the group parameter .",
    "therefore , we could equally well give the vector field @xmath206 that generates @xmath26 .",
    "in the chart introduced above , @xmath207 but , except for this condition , @xmath206 remains arbitrary . with a slight abuse of terminology",
    ", we shall sometimes refer also to such a vector field as a _ gauge_.    the perturbation can now be defined simply as @xmath208 the first term on the right hand side of ( [ deltat ] ) can be taylor - expanded to get @xmath209 where @xmath210_{\\lambda=0,{\\cal m}_0}\\;. \\label{deltakt}\\ ] ] equation ( [ deltakt ] ) defines then the @xmath11-th order perturbation of @xmath1 .",
    "notice that @xmath211 and @xmath212 are defined on @xmath202 ; this formalizes the statement one commonly finds in the literature , that `` perturbations are fields living in the background . ''",
    "it is important to appreciate that the parameter @xmath50 labeling the various spacetime models serves also to perform the expansion ( [ deltat1 ] ) , and determines therefore what one means by `` perturbations of the @xmath11-th order . ''",
    "however , as we have already pointed out , there are applications where @xmath50 is , to a large extent , arbitrary . in these cases ,",
    "the split of @xmath211 into perturbations of first order , second order , and so on , has no absolute meaning , because a change of @xmath50 , i.e. , a reparametrization of the family of spacetimes , will mix them up .",
    "what is invariantly defined , is only the quantity @xmath211 , whereas the various @xmath213 are meaningful only once a choice of the parameter has been made .",
    "now , we are interested in those cases in which ( [ eq : ee ] ) is too difficult to solve exactly , so that one looks for approximate solutions , to some order @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we can now obtain much simpler _ linear _ equations from ( [ eq : ee ] ) . at first order , differentiating ( [ eq : ee ] ) with respect to @xmath50 and setting @xmath50 equal to zero",
    ", one obtains @xcite a linear equation for @xmath214 and @xmath215 . at second order , a second derivative with respect to @xmath50 of ( [ eq : ee ] ) at @xmath51 gives an equation of the type @xmath216=s\\left [ \\delta g , \\delta\\tau\\right]\\ , , \\ ] ] which is linear in the second order perturbations @xmath217 and @xmath218 , and where the first order perturbations @xmath214 , @xmath215 now appear as known source terms .",
    "this can obviously be extended to higher orders , giving an iterative procedure to calculate @xmath219 and @xmath220  hence @xmath182 and @xmath183  to the required accuracy .",
    "let us now suppose that two vector fields @xmath206 and @xmath221 are defined on @xmath196 , such that they have @xmath222 everywhere . correspondingly , their integral curves define two flows @xmath26 and @xmath140 on @xmath24 , that connect any two leaves of the foliation .",
    "thus @xmath206 and @xmath221 are everywhere transverse to the @xmath199 , and points lying on the same integral curve of either of the two are to be regarded _ as the same point _ within the respective gauge : @xmath26 and @xmath140 are both point identification maps , i.e. , two different gauge choices .",
    "the fields @xmath206 and @xmath221 can both be used to pull back a generic tensor field @xmath1 , and to construct therefore two other tensor fields @xmath223 and @xmath224 , for any given value of @xmath50 .",

    "in this paper we have studied the problem of gauge dependence in relativistic perturbation theory , considering perturbations of arbitrary order in a geometrical perspective . in fact",
    ", the problem itself is of a purely geometrical nature , dealing with the arbitrariness in the mapping between the physical spacetime and the background unperturbed one .",
    "since no dynamics is involved , the formalism developed here can actually find application not only in general relativity , but in any spacetime theory .",
    "in considering a specific example , we have assumed a flat robertson  walker background , and derived the second order transformation between the well - known synchronous gauge @xcite , and the poisson ( generalized longitudinal ) gauge discussed in @xcite .    in linearized perturbation theory a gauge transformation",
    "is generated by an arbitrary vector field @xmath3 , defined on the background spacetime , and associated with a one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms ( a flow ) : the gauge transformation of the perturbation @xmath374 of a tensor field @xmath1 is then given by the lie derivative @xmath375 of the background field @xmath6 . however , in considering a gauge transformation from an exact point of view , we have found that it is not represented by a flow , but rather by a more general one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms .",
    "the question then was , how can we approximate the latter to a given to this end , we have developed in section 2 the necessary mathematical formalism .",
    "first , we have introduced certain families of mappings , dubbed knight diffeomorphisms of rank @xmath0 , defined by ( [ eq : knightn ] ) .",
    "then , in theorem 2 , we have proved that any one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms may always be approximated , to order @xmath0 , by a knight diffeomorphism of rank @xmath0 .",
    "this result ( which confirms a claim in @xcite ) is fundamental for gauge transformations of order @xmath0 , as it guarantees that they are correctly represented by knight diffeomorphisms of the same rank . from the applicative point of view ,",
    "lemma 2 is thus all we need to have a generating formula for the gauge transformation to an arbitrary order , ( [ lemma2applied ] ) .",
    "since a knight diffeomorphism of rank @xmath0 is basically the composition of @xmath0 flows , and is thus generated by @xmath0 vector fields @xmath376 , a gauge transformation of order @xmath0 for the @xmath0-th order perturbation @xmath377 of a tensor field @xmath1 involves an appropriate combination of the lie derivatives along @xmath378 of @xmath379 .",
    "gauge transformations found their main application in considering the time evolution of perturbations of a given background spacetime : in a subsequent paper@xcite we shall look at second order perturbations of an einstein de sitter universe , comparing results in the synchronous and the poisson gauges , thus applying the results presented in section 5 . beyond these applications , there are many topics that we have not touched upon here which , in a way or another , are related to gauge transformations , and become even more cumbersome in the non - linear case .",
    "we mention only a couple of them . we have implicitly assumed the applicability of the perturbative method",
    "; also , we have not considered the problem of eliminating spurious gauge modes .",
    "in particular , in our cosmological example , the synchronous gauge as defined in section 5 should actually be regarded as a _ class _ of point identification maps @xcite .",
    "a final issue we would like to mention is that of gauge - invariant quantities . in relation to this , we have first defined gauge invariance in an exact sense , and then given the conditions for the gauge invariance of a tensor field @xmath1 to an arbitrary perturbative order @xmath0",
    ". however , we have not faced the problem of finding or constructing such quantities . in particular , in considering cosmological perturbations , it would be useful to have at hand a set of second order gauge - invariant variables defined _  la _",
    ". however , given the gauge - dependent metric perturbations and their transformation rules presented in section 5 , the construction of such variables seems impractical .",
    "moreover , it is far from obvious that a complete set giving a full second order description exists at all , as is the case at first order @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to look for covariant quantities @xcite : in order to be second order gauge - invariant these should vanish in the background and at first order . assuming purely scalar first order perturbations , two examples are the magnetic part of the weyl tensor and the vorticity of the 4-velocity of matter .",
    "other second order gauge - invariant quantities can be defined by taking products of first order gauge - invariant tensors that vanish in the background . in particular , this is the case for scalars such as @xmath380 , where @xmath381 is the electric part of the weyl tensor . once again , it seems difficult that a complete set of such variables could even exist .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out that quantities which are quadratic in first order gauge - invariant variables are useful in specific problems ; for example they may intervene in the construction of effective energy momentum tensors of perturbations , which are important for the study of back reaction problems @xcite .",
    "another possible application of the formalism developed here can be the study of the gauge dependence of these quantities .",
