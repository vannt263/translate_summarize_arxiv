    "the kuiper belt , a remnant debris disk that surrounds the planetary realm of our solar system , is a relatively pristine record of the prevailing conditions during the formation of the solar system .",
    "subsequent evolution has overprinted this original state such that present day observations allude to the combination of accretion and eons of collisions .",
    "observations of individual kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) allow explorations of bodies with aged , but primordial , compositions .",
    "studies of binary kbos @xcite provide albedo constraints , usually under a density assumption , and may increase what little is known about the internal composition and structure of kbos .",
    "small solar system body lightcurves have been studied for many years , principally for asteroids @xcite and comets ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "lightcurves of small objects are often interpreted as manifestations of reflections from irregularly shaped objects , and lightcurve information has been shown to correspond well with radar - derived shape models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . with the continued increase in the number of known kbos ( and hence bright kbos ) and access to improving observing technologies ,",
    "kbo lightcurves can now be studied .",
    "published lightcurve data exist for 65  kbos and centaurs , with approximately half showing lightcurves greater than around 0.1  magnitudes with a typical amplitude around 0.5  magnitudes .",
    "2001  qg@xmath3 has the largest known kbo lightcurve amplitude of 1.14  magnitudes @xcite .",
    "kbo lightcurves are though to imply either heterogeneous albedo distributions or else asphericities , with the extreme case of the latter potentially being contact binary kbos @xcite .",
    "the kbo lightcurve literature is tabulated and analyzed in section  [ densities ] .    here",
    "we report high precision photometry for four kbos observed with the hubble space telescope ( section  [ obs ] ) .",
    "the capabilities of the hst and the extended duration of this study permit , for the first time , the study of photometric variations of very faint and therefore small kbos and the detection of very small ( @xmath4  mag ) variations of modest - sized kbos .",
    "two of these kbos show clear periodic variation ; a third shows a somewhat less significant periodic variation ; and the fourth has no distinguishable periodic signature ( section  [ analysis ] ) .",
    "we discuss interpretations of this data in sections  [ surface ] and  [ geophysics ] and the implications in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we have carried out a large ( 125  orbits ) hubble space telescope / advanced camera for surveys ( hst / acs ) observing program to search for very faint kbos .",
    "the primary results of this program  discovery of a substantial deficit of classical and excited kbos at small sizes  are reported in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the relevant technical details of the observations and data reduction ( see @xcite for complete discussions ) .",
    "our observations were divided into two epochs , the `` discovery epoch '' ( ut 2003 january 26.01431.341 ) , in which @xmath5  s exposures were taken at each of the six pointings ; and the `` recovery epoch '' ( 2003 february 05.83509.703 ) , in which an additional @xmath6  s exposures were taken at each pointing . during the discovery epoch , a given pointing is sampled sporadically , with intervals as small as 8  minutes , over a time span of approximately 24  hours ; the pointing is revisited 2  days later with the same sporadic sampling . approximately 7  days later , the entire cycle repeats for the recovery epoch .",
    "consequently , we obtained @xmath7  independent measurements of each kbo observed , over a time baseline of around 12  days , with sampling as fine as minutes in some cases but with windows of several days ( or more ) in which no observations of a given kbo were made .",
    "@xcite detected three new kbos ( 2003  bf@xmath0 , 2003  bg@xmath0 , and 2003  bh@xmath0 ) as well as a previously known kbo ( 2000  fv@xmath1 ) that was targeted in the observations .",
    "2000  fv@xmath1  was detected with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath8 in each of its individual exposures ; hence , the photometry is quite precise .",
    "2003  bg@xmath0 , 2003  bf@xmath0 , and 2003  bh@xmath0  were discovered with @xmath9 in individual exposures typically 7.5 , 2.7 , and 2.4 , respectively .",
    "discovery of the last object required the use of `` digital tracking , '' in which exposures are shifted at rates corresponding to all valid kbo orbits before summing and searching for flux peaks that exceed the detection threshold .",
    "photometry for each object was extracted by fitting a model of a moving point source to relevant exposures .",
    "we measured the point spread function ( psf ) for the acs wide field camera ( wfc ) in exposures of a globular cluster field . in the moving point source model - fitting , this psf was smeared before fitting to the relevant pixels to account for the ( slight ) trailing expected on each exposure .",
    "we fit the entire stack of images simultaneously , with the free parameters being the 6 relevant degrees of freedom in the kbo orbit plus an unknown flux for each exposure . the best - fit photometry and orbit are thus solved simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath9 per exposure for 2000  fv@xmath1  is so high that we use a slightly different approach , allowing the position to be a free parameter on each exposure rather than forcing positions to obey a common orbit . without this approach ,",
    "we find that small ( milliarcsecond ) errors in the astrometric solutions for the wfc cause excess variance in the flux determinations . for the fainter three kbos , the flux errors due to these @xmath105  milliarcsecond astrometric errors are a few hundredths of a magnitude , well below the noise levels .",
    "the slow brightening due to the decreasing illumination phase of the kbos is too small to be detected in our data .",
    "the fitting process produces uncertainties for each flux measurement .",
    "we find that the best - fit sinusoidal light curves give @xmath11 per degree of freedom ( dof ) near unity for the three faint bodies ( see below ) , suggesting that our error estimates are reliable .",
    "the @xmath11 for the best sinusoidal fit for 2000  fv@xmath1  is too high , partly because the light curve is clearly not sinusoidal ( see below ) , but also because various systematic effects ( e.g. , pointing jitter ) may affect the psf fitting at the 0.01  mag level .",
    "the formal errors on the magnitudes may also be underestimated , as is common for very high @xmath9 photometry .",
    "the midpoint time of each exposure is corrected for light - travel time from the target .",
    "the time - series photometry for these four objects is presented in tables  [ bgtable ]  [ fvtable ] .",

    "the best - fit sinusoid solution to the photometry of 2003  bh@xmath0  has a period of 2.8  hours and amplitude of 0.42  magnitudes .",
    "however , the significance of this solution is only 46% when compared to 100  randomized trials of the 2003  bh@xmath0  data .",
    "we therefore conclude that we failed to detect significant periodic variability for 2003  bh@xmath0 . to place an upper limit on the amplitude of an undetected periodic variation , we augmented the 2003  bh@xmath0  data with synthetic lightcurves with various amplitudes and periods of 4  hours ( a typical kbo photometric variation period ) and carried out the best - fit solution search described above .",
    "we successfully recovered all synthetic lightcurves with amplitudes larger than around  15% .",
    "we can therefore place an upper limit on possible lightcurve amplitudes for 2003  bh@xmath0 , requiring that any such variation must have an amplitude less than 0.15  magnitudes to be undetected by us .",
    "the albedo variations and/or asphericity of this body must be less than 15% .      the best - fit solution for 2000  fv@xmath1",
    "gives a period of 7.5  hours .",
    "there is a peak of nearly equal significance at 3.79  hours , almost exactly half the best solution .",
    "the amplitude of the lightcurve is identical ( 0.07  mag ) for both solutions .",
    "we compare the 2000  fv@xmath1  observed data phased at each of these two periods in figure  [ fvphase ] .",
    "the phased data in the top panel appears double - peaked , with maxima at phases of 0.30.35 and 0.951.0 .",
    "these two peaks have different shapes and are not 0.5  phase units apart , so we conclude that this lightcurve is double - peaked and non - sinusoidal , and that 7.5  hours is the true rotation period of 2000  fv@xmath1 .",
    "( we note a low - signal maximum for 2000  fv@xmath1  in figure  [ period ] at 15  hours , which could be an alias of the 7.5  hour rotation period . )",
    "however , we include the 3.79  hour period in discussions below for completeness ; this lightcurve ( lower panel ) is also significantly non - sinusoidal .",
    "arguably , the true photometric period could be 3.79  hours , with 7.5  hours an alias of this true photometric period .",
    "we discuss the implications of the non - sinusoidal lightcurve below .",
    "observations of kbos are necessarily conducted with the line of sight very close to the direction of illumination : in our case , 14 and 17 for the new bodies and 2000  fv@xmath1 , respectively . in this case",
    "we can ascribe lightcurve variations to some combination of ( 1 ) variation in surface composition and/or albedo that rotate through the observed hemisphere ; ( 2 ) small - scale irregularities ( `` facets '' ) that rotate through ( un-)favorable orientations for reflecting radiation to the observer ; or ( 3 ) changes in projected area of the rotating body due to its gross shape , often approximated as an ellipsoid .",
    "we will examine in turn these possible causes for the photometric variations of our measured kbos , with the goal of extracting any possible constraints on their internal structure or surface composition .",
    "we will focus primarily on the objects 2003  bf@xmath0  and 2000  fv@xmath1because their exceptionally large and small photometric variations , respectively , provide the most interesting constraints .",
    "the lightcurves of 2003  bg@xmath0  and 2003  bh@xmath0are relatively unremarkable and do not help differentiate among possible physical models , so they will not be discussed further .",
    "if the large observed lightcurve variation of 2003  bf@xmath0  is due entirely to albedo variations , surface patches with albedos that differ by a factor of  2.5 are required if the body has two distinct hemispheres and the rotation pole is perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "if either of these two assumptions is relaxed , the required albedo range of the surface materials is even higher .",
    "little is known about kbo albedos .",
    "the few data points suggest a range from a few percent to perhaps 20% or more @xcite . the canonical ( but unsupported ; see @xcite and others ) kbo albedo of 4% , which is based on comet albedos , is more than 4  times smaller than the 17% albedo observed for ( 55565 ) 2002  aw@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this large albedo range could therefore plausibly exist on 2003  bf@xmath0 , though this possibility seems extreme and is not consistent with the existing sparse kbo albedo data .",
    "the range of albedos on pluto s surface exceeds a factor of  5 @xcite , although pluto s atmosphere contributes substantially to this effect and 2003  bf@xmath0  would not be expected to have any atmosphere ( because of its small size ) .",
    "the two hemispheres of iapetus have albedos differing by a factor of  7 , though this is likely due both to being tidally locked to saturn and to contamination from other satellites .    these considerations favor shape over albedo as the primary cause of the variability of 2003  bf@xmath0 , more so because the main - belt asteroid ( 243 )  ida provides a ( rocky ) example of the shape needed to produce this light curve (  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , albedo and shape could be correlated , as would be the case with a large , fresh , bright crater .",
    "furthermore , a crater or albedo feature could potentially dominate the majority of a hemisphere of a small body like 2003  bf@xmath0 , so we can not exclude the possibility of a wide range of surface reflectance on 2003  bf@xmath0 .",
    "additionally , kbo surfaces likely incorporate volatiles that could potentially be mobilized either through collisions or potentially even seasonal thermal variations .",
    "migration of volatiles could plausibly create patchy surfaces with albedo variations .",
    "the small photometric variations for the other three bodies could easily be explained by albedo variations on the surface .",
    "we note that lightcurves from albedo variations need not be symmetric , and the non - sinusoidal lightcurve of 2000  fv@xmath1  suggests the rotation of ( two ) bright spots past the subobserver point .",
    "however , it is unlikely that albedo variations would conspire to reduce the amplitude of an otherwise large , shape - derived light curve ( this would require a dark long axis and bright short axis of an elongated rotating body ) .",
    "therefore , the possibility of albedo variation does not invalidate the geophysical arguments presented below .",
    "a second possible explanation of the kbo lightcurves arises from study of small bodies of the inner solar system .",
    "complex shape models have been determined for a number of asteroids and near earth objects ( neos ) not only from spacecraft observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) but also from radar studies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "good lightcurves have been measured for many asteroids and neos whose shapes are known , and several neos are observed to have lightcurve amplitudes substantially larger or smaller than their elongated shapes naively would suggest @xcite . because asteroids , kbos , and comets all are heavily cratered bodies , non - uniform facets ( reflecting faces and partially concave shapes )",
    "potentially can mask the true shape of the body .",
    "the scenario in which faceted kbos show lightcurves larger than their gross shape would otherwise suggest can not be ruled out .",
    "thus , 2003  bf@xmath0  could have a complicated topography that produces a lightcurve that  at least during our observing season  is substantially larger than its gross shape might otherwise indicate .",
    "conversely , the gross shape of 2000  fv@xmath1  may be less regular than its small amplitude light curve suggests , a caveat to bear in mind for the analyses below .",
    "facets on 2000  fv@xmath1  could also produce the observed non - sinusoidal lightcurve .",
    "in this section we regard the photometric variation as primarily a result of the gross shape of the kbo , and examine the constraints on internal strength and density that may be derived from the rotation properties .",
    "we will focus primarily on the constraints imposed by the small 0.07  mag amplitude of the 2000  fv@xmath1  lightcurve .      observed kbo brightness variations may be the result of the gross aspherical shape of the body .",
    "a kbo may generally be thought of as having three primary axes , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and where rotation takes place about @xmath21 in the minimized energy and angular momentum state .",
    "if this body is viewed equatorially , the ratio @xmath23 determines the magnitude of the observed lightcurve modulation as @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite present a formalism for calculating an observed magnitude variation ( for essentially lambertian bodies ) as a function of body shape and the viewing angle @xmath25 between the rotation axis and the ( coincident ) lines of sight and illumination ( their equation  2 ) .",
    "the conditions in which amplitudes smaller than 0.07  mag are produced correspond to bodies of any shape seen nearly pole - on ( @xmath26 ) ; and nearly spherical bodies ( @xmath27 ) seen at any angle . note that for a kbo in pole - on rotation , the coincidence of illumination , line - of - sight , and rotation axes drives the lightcurve amplitude to zero regardless of the body shape or surface properties . in this configuration ,",
    "the low amplitude of the 2000  fv@xmath1  lightcurve would allow no definitive constraints on its properties ( although a useful constraint can still be derived from the photometric period ; see below ) .",
    "if 2000  fv@xmath1  is significantly aspherical and exactly pole - on at present , its lightcurve amplitude should increase as it proceeds along its 250  year orbit ; a 20  year observational baseline could provide a pole - earth angle change of @xmath1030  degrees , potentially revealing the equatorial aspect and therefore shape of the body .",
    "however , 2000  fv@xmath1  was targeted without regard to variability properties , so we can consider its pole orientation to be a random variable .",
    "rotation axes within 25  of pole - on occur less than 10% of the time for random orientations , so we will exclude as unlikely any solution that requires @xmath28 .",
    "we note further that , of the 10  kbos and centaurs with @xmath29 ( that is , objects around the size of 2000  fv@xmath1 ) and measured light curves , 4  have amplitudes @xmath30  mag ( see table  [ otherdata ] ) .",
    "low variability is therefore not rare in the 2000  fv@xmath1  size range , consistent with the argument that the small 2000  fv@xmath1  lightcurve need not be produced by an unlikely orientation .",
    "if the small lightcurve is not produced by a nearly pole - on orientation , several approaches lead to interesting constraints on the physical properties of 2000  fv@xmath1 .",
    "we consider in turn the possibilities that 2000  fv@xmath1  has essentially zero internal strength ( a fluid ) ; low internal strength ( a rubble pile ) ; or material strength as in a monolithic ( consolidated ) body .",
    "@xcite ; and @xcite have discussed the energy distributions and shapes of rotating , equilibrium , fluid bodies , and we apply their analyses here .",
    "the physical state of a rotating , fluid ( strengthless ) body depends on the angular momentum and distribution of matter .",
    "non- or slowly - rotating fluid bodies are generally spherical .",
    "moderate rotation produces a maclaurin spheroid in which @xmath31 , and faster rotation results in a triaxial jacobian ellipsoid in which @xmath32 .",
    "hubbard defines the dimensionless rotation rate @xmath33 as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the angular rotation rate and @xmath36 is the bulk density of the body ; in this formalism , the transition from maclaurin to jacobian bodies occurs at the bifurcation point @xmath37 .",
    "the maximum value for the dimensionless rotation rate ( @xmath33 ) is reached at the bifurcation point .",
    "thus , the minimum density for a fluid 2000  fv@xmath1  is 0.67  g  @xmath2 for a rotation period of 7.5  hours .",
    "all densities greater than this produce two theoretically viable solutions , one representing the jacobian ellipsoid branch of solutions and one the the maclaurin spheroid branch . here",
    "we consider each branch in turn .",
    "if we assume that the observed 2000  fv@xmath1lightcurve is derived from the gross shape of the body , then we require the branch of solutions corresponding to a triaxial jacobian ellipsoid where @xmath38 .",
    "the rotation period must be 7.5  hours : if the best - fit solution of 7.5  hours is used , its double - peaked nature implies that it is a complete rotation period , whereas if the second - best - fit solution of 3.79  hours is used , its single peak implies that 3.79  hours corresponds to only a half period ( since the lightcurve is shaped - derived for a jacobian body ) .",
    "hence , we know @xmath35 ( the angular rotation rate ) .",
    "tassoul introduces @xmath39 , which describes the energy state of a rotating body and which is the ratio of rotational kinetic energy ( k ) to the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy ( w ) : @xmath40 , where @xmath39 is small for nearly spherical bodies and increases for bodies with increasing asphericities ( figure  [ fvfig ] ) .",
    "tassoul shows the relationship between @xmath41 and @xmath39 ; from equation  [ hubbeqn ] and our knowledge of @xmath35 , we convert this relationship to @xmath36 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "this result  bulk density as a function of the energy state of the body for a jacobian ellipsoid  is shown in figure  [ fvfig ] as the red line on the right half of the plot .",
    "@xcite tabulates the relationship between @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( what chandrasekhar writes as @xmath33 we write here as @xmath35 , the angular rotation rate ) .",
    "we therefore can derive the relationship between @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath36 , and consequently between @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath39 . from @xmath42 and the observed @xmath45 , we calculate the required viewing angle @xmath25 following equation  2 of @xcite , deriving @xmath25 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "lastly , we introduce @xmath46 , which is the probability , from simple geometric arguments , that a randomly oriented rotation pole has an orientation angle less than or equal to @xmath25 .",
    "we show @xmath47 as a function of @xmath39 in figure  [ fvfig ] .",
    "we exclude @xmath48 solutions as improbable . for 2000",
    "fv@xmath1 , @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 and @xmath51 and to @xmath52  g  @xmath2 ( figure  [ fvfig ] ) .",
    "thus , for jacobian solutions  the _ only _ fluid solutions in which the photometric lightcurve is derived from the gross aspherical shape of the body  the bulk density of 2000  fv@xmath1must be 0.671.0  g  @xmath2 ( red solid line in figure  [ fvfig ] ) . by comparison ,",
    "assigning pluto s density of 2  g  @xmath2 @xcite to 2000  fv@xmath1  and assuming a jacobian solution , we find @xmath53 and @xmath54 , a long , thin body whose shape would be the most extreme in the solar system : asteroid 216  kleopatra ( the `` dogbone asteroid '' ) has @xmath23 around  2.3 @xcite .",
    "the maclaurin branch of solutions represents oblate spheroids with @xmath55 and rotation about @xmath21 . in this scenario",
    ", there is no modulation of cross - sectional area during rotation . here",
    ", photometric variations must be due to surface features , either albedo variations ( section  [ albedo ] ) or facets ( section  [ facets ] ) .",
    "the rotation period for 2000  fv@xmath1  could therefore be the second - best - fit solution of 3.79  hours , as a double - peaked lightcurve ( i.e. , the 7.5  hour period ) would have to be produced by the unlikely configuration of bright ( or dark ) spots on opposite hemispheres of a body .",
    "we show the solution for a 3.79  hour rotation period in green in figure  [ fvfig ] ; the minimum allowable density is 2.7  g  @xmath2 , slightly higher than that of the ( presumed rocky ) neo 433  eros .",
    "though there is formally no maximum , densities larger than 4  g  @xmath2 are remarkably unlikely . if 2000  fv@xmath1  is a maclaurin body with a double - peaked lightcurve and rotation period of 7.5  hours",
    " a situation we consider unlikely because of the requirement that like surface features be antipodal , a seemingly improbable configuration  then the red dashed line on the left half of figure  [ fvfig ] obtains .",
    "to summarize , if 2000  fv@xmath1  is strengthless ( fluid ) , there are two primary solutions , both of which would be surprising : ( 1 ) 2000  fv@xmath1  is a triaxial body with @xmath36 in the range 0.671.0  g  @xmath2 , implying a very high ice fraction or very high porosity ; or ( 2 ) 2000  fv@xmath1  is an oblate spheroid with a `` bright spot '' ( or else in an unlikely pole - on orientation ) and has density @xmath56  g  @xmath2 , which is quite high for a body that is expected to be rock and ice with moderate porosity .",
    "we are forced to conclude that a strengthless 2000  fv@xmath1  must have a composition that is either surprisingly ice - rich or surprisingly rock - rich , implying that it is a fragment of a differentiated body .",
    "however , the ( implied ) sphericity and relatively large size of 2000  fv@xmath1do not favor the fragment interpretation .    geophysical fluid solutions for 2003  bf@xmath0  place no surprising constraints on its density : for jacobian solutions , density is in the expected range 0.52.5  g  @xmath2 , and for the `` maclaurian - with - a - spot '' model , the lower limit the density is 0.5  g  @xmath2 .      in the previous section , we found that the fluid solutions for 2000  fv@xmath1require surprising densities ( or may be geometrically unlikely )",
    "however , if kbos are rubble piles made of rocks and ice , we can relax the fluid assumption by allowing these rotating bodies to have intrinsic strength .",
    "@xcite has studied the effects on body shapes and rotation rates of allowing cohesionless rubble piles to experience internal friction akin to the strength exhibited by a pile of sand .",
    "the results are described in terms of @xmath57 , the angle of internal friction ( or angle of repose ) .",
    "fluids necessarily have @xmath58 ; typical terrestrial soils have @xmath59 . allowing bodies to have non -",
    "zero internal friction allows shapes that depart from the maclaurin - jacobian spheroid / ellipsoid sequence . we must assume a density to constrain internal friction",
    "; we first consider 2000  fv@xmath1  and assume @xmath60  g  @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the prolate spheroid case @xmath61 ( e.g. , holsapple figures  3 and  5 ) , assumed to be rotating about @xmath21 with a rotation period of 7.5  hours .",
    "holsapple assumes equatorial viewing , which we are not restricted to in our analysis .",
    "instead we may consider a range of axis ratios , where each value of @xmath42 implies a specific viewing angle @xmath25 as constrained by the observed lightcurve amplitude .",
    "holsapple s dimensionless rotation rate ( which he defines as @xmath62 ) is determined by our assumption of @xmath36 and knowledge of @xmath35 .",
    "if we require @xmath63 , then @xmath42 for 2000  fv@xmath1  must be in the range  0.360.93 . throughout this range , @xmath64 ( figure  [ phi ] ) .",
    "we now relax our density assumption . carrying out the same analysis for @xmath65  g  @xmath2",
    ", we find that @xmath57 is less than 15@xmath66 for all orientations with @xmath67 ( figure  [ phi ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath68  g  @xmath2 , the minimum @xmath57 is around 13@xmath66 and probable orientations require large @xmath57 .",
    "we thus find that the internal friction for 2000  fv@xmath1  can reasonably be small but non - zero .",
    "additionally , densities much less than 1  g  @xmath2 have solutions that increasingly require @xmath69 , an unlikely physical scenario .",
    "therefore , the physical picture that emerges is the following : 2000  fv@xmath1  can readily be a rubble pile with density 12  g  @xmath2 and small angles of internal friction .",
    "this solution does not require excessive porosity ( from density estimates ) .",
    "this weak rubble pile body  multiply impacted into a collection of blocks that has only small internal friction  may be nearly , but not quite , relaxed to geophysical fluid equilibrium configuration .",
    "this interpretation also allows for the non - sinusoidal lightcurve observed for 2000  fv@xmath1  is the body may still contain blocks that are out of fluid equilibrium .    for 2003  bf@xmath0 , @xmath68  g  @xmath2 produces solutions for @xmath57 of generally less than 15  degrees .",
    "2003  bf@xmath0  solutions for @xmath70  and 2.0  g  @xmath2 increasingly include @xmath57 of 1825  degrees as well as narrow regions ( in @xmath42 ) of acceptably low internal friction and very high internal friction ( see holsapple figure  3 ) .",
    "we conclude that no combination of density and internal friction are precluded for 2003  bf@xmath0 , though @xmath57 of 25  degrees is larger than is observed for most asteroids @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that 2003  bf@xmath0  is more likely to be kept out of equilibrium by monolithic strength ( see below ) than by rubble - pile friction .",
    "we considered above small - grained rubble piles , gravitational aggregates of loose material ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rubble pile bodies can also have `` strength '' if they consist of some large blocks in a mixture of smaller rubble ( d.  richardson , pers .",
    "finally , small bodies in the solar system can be strong if they are monolithic bodies  essentially a single chip or fragment from a larger body , or the frozen remnant of a previously fluid body . in theory",
    ", such bodies could be either rock or ice .",
    "2000  fv@xmath1  may be far from an equilibrium rotation configuration if it is composed of one ( or a few ) blocks of solid material .",
    "surface gravity scales linearly with the product of size and density ; using this rough guideline , topography on 2000  fv@xmath1  on the order of 10  km ( enough to create 10% asymmetries ) could easily be supported by strength ( e.  apshaug , pers .",
    "if monolithic strength exists on 2000  fv@xmath1  and supports topography , though , then the question exists why 2000  fv@xmath1  is nearly symmetric as its lightcurve suggests .",
    "additionally , dynamical arguments ( see below ) suggest a much - impacted and therefore completely shattered and rubble - like body .",
    "irregular surface topography  that need not be supported by monolithic strength and is similar to the facets discussed above  could produce the non - sinusoidal lightcurve observed for 2000  fv@xmath1 .",
    "the pressure at the center of a planetary body may be approximated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the mass and radius of the body .",
    "when @xmath42 for 2003  bf@xmath0  is in the range 0.30.9 , the overburden pressure produced by the asymmetric shape is 110  kilobars .",
    "the strength of clean laboratory ice is approximately 10  kilobars and that of snow is 0.010.1  kilobars ( e.  asphaug , pers .",
    "thus , the central stress in 2003  bf@xmath0  could easily be supported by its material strength .",
    "2003  bf@xmath0could easily be a rotating , coherent monolith with a substantially aspherical shape .",
    "2000  fv@xmath1  is a modest - sized kbo of diameter 116  km if the albedo is 0.10 .",
    "there is a small chance that the low amplitude of the 2000  fv@xmath1  light curve is attributable to pole - on rotation , but otherwise it must be a remarkably spherical body . topography is allowed by strength arguments , but the size of 2000  fv@xmath1  suggests that it should have been impacted many times ( @xcite ; see below ) and hence be a rubble pile , not a monolithic body .",
    "the solutions for a fluid body require either a surprisingly low ( @xmath171  g  @xmath2 ) or high ( @xmath162.7  g  @xmath2 ) density , likely requiring 2000  fv@xmath1  to be a remnant of a differentiated body .",
    "the former solution may imply a remarkably large porosity .",
    "a more plausible solution is that 2000  fv@xmath1  is a rubble pile of density 12  g  @xmath2 , held slightly out of the minimum - energy shape by internal friction among constituent blocks that are relatively small .",
    "the non - sinusoidal light curve of 2000  fv@xmath1requires surface inhomogeneity or a departure from ellipsoidal shape , but either effect need only be slight , and the latter is easily allowed for by a nearly - relaxed rotating body with non - zero internal friction .",
    "the flux from the small body 2003  bf@xmath0(20  kilometers diameter , for albedo of 10% ) varies by a factor  @xmath162.5 over the light curve .",
    "such large - amplitude variation is achievable if the body is an irregularly - shaped collisional remnant consisting of one or a small number of coherent fragments supported by material strength .",
    "alternately , extreme albedo variations would be required to explain the 1.09  mag lightcurve variation , perhaps with one impact - generated clean ice hemisphere contrasting with a darker ( 5%10% albedo , consistent with that measured for other kbos and centaurs ) hemisphere .",
    "the acs data for 2003  bg@xmath0  and 2003  bh@xmath0do not allow placing any interesting constraints on surface or internal composition .",
    "the kuiper belt is generally thought of as a collisionally evolved population .",
    "this environment can readily produce facets on kbos ; impacts likely can also produce albedo features on kbos through cratering ; and elongated objects can be produced through fragmentation .",
    "however , the nearly spherical 2000  fv@xmath1  must also be created through , or survive , collisional evolution . @xcite",
    "have calculated the timescale for disruptive collisions based on the present environment in the kuiper belt and assuming the pre-@xcite understanding ( i.e. , overestimation ) of the small - end size distribution .",
    "they found that the timescale for disrupting a 100  km kbo is substantially longer than the age of the solar system .",
    "thus , 2000  fv@xmath1  is likely not a fragment that was recently created . instead , the size of 2000  fv@xmath1  likely records the timescale and efficiency of accretion in the kuiper belt : 2000  fv@xmath1represents an intermediate product of the accretion process that formed kuiper belt giants like quaoar and pluto .",
    "@xcite showed that pairwise accretion of rubble piles can produce both spherical and aspherical bodies .",
    "thus , both 2000  fv@xmath1  and quaoar , which potentially has a 10% asphericity as indicated by its lightcurve @xcite , can have gross shapes that are the direct result of rubble pile accretion .",
    "additionally , 2000  fv@xmath1may have been impacted many times since its formation , resulting in a completely shattered body ( consistent with @xcite ) ; we note that early in the solar system s history , the space density of bodies in the kuiper belt was higher than today and the impact rate was higher than at present .",
    "multiple collisions can produce the small internal friction values we derived in section  [ strength ] .",
    "a consistent picture for 2000  fv@xmath1  is therefore that of a body that accreted to approximately its present size ; has been substantially shattered due to extensive collisions ; has little internal friction due to its rubble pile nature ; and is nearly , but not completely , relaxed , thus nearly attaining a rotating fluid equilibrium state .",
    "@xcite find that the disruption timescale for a 30  kilometer body is also longer than the solar system , implying that formally a 30-km kbo would reflect primordial growth , not collisional disruption . including",
    "the @xcite results will increase the disruption timescale for bodies of this size because of the dearth of small bodies .",
    "thus , the picture for 2003  bf@xmath0  may be somewhat complicated , as an elongated body is implied by its lightcurve amplitude .",
    "2003  bf@xmath0  may be a fragment from an unusual , but not wildly improbable , collision between 50100  kilometer bodies . furthermore , this collision could have occured billions of years ago when the space density of kbos was higher , before later dynamical sculpting and mass loss ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our interpretation of the 2003  bf@xmath0  data is that the body is an elongated kbo ( though not necessarily a monolithic body ) , and the collisional fragment solution is appealing in this case .",
    "alternately , 2003  bf@xmath0  may have a complicated surface that produces a lightcurve larger than its gross shape would suggest .",
    "eons of impacts certainly could produce arbitrarily complicated surface topographies , though @xcite show that cumulative small impacts on rotating asteroids tend to lead to oblate shapes , which can not produce the observed lightcurve .",
    "understanding this object , in the absence of many comparably small kbos , requires us to look elsewhere in the solar system ( section  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "we list in table  [ otherdata ] the 65  kbos and centaurs ( excluding comets ) for which lightcurve measurements or upper limits have been published ; 37  of these have reported periodic lightcurve amplitudes , typically greater than @xmath100.1  magnitudes .",
    "most of these bodies have implied rotational periods ( or half - periods for double - peaked lightcurves ) in the range 310  hours , similar to the periods derived for our hst / acs kbo observations .",
    "note that these surveys certainly do not represent a complete nor random sample : some non - detections are likely unreported , and these observations represent mostly the brightest ( largest ) kbos , so biases certainly exist in this compiled literature sample .",
    "nevertheless , interesting results can be derived .",
    "the amplitude we derive for 2003  bf@xmath0 , together with the recently measured amplitude of 1.14  mag for 2001  qg@xmath3 @xcite , are the largest amplitude variations ( to date ) for kbos and centaurs .",

    "although more rigorous treatments of lightcurve data are possible , as shown above , we will here make this assumption to allow ready comparisons among bodies ( and to the main belt asteroid and neo populations ) .",
    "following @xcite , we plot lightcurve amplitudes and observed periods for all presently known kbo and centaur data , including our new hst data for 2003  bf@xmath0 , 2003  bg@xmath0 , and  2000  fv@xmath1(figure  [ spin ] ) .",
    "the rotation periods of most kbos and centaurs could be either the observed photometric period ( open circles in figure  [ spin ] ) or twice the photometric period ( closed symbols ) . for cases in which the true periods are known from double - peaked lightcurves , only this true period is plotted ( closed symbol ) .    in figure  [ spin ]",
    "we also show solutions corresponding to critical periods for densities spanning the range of plausible values for icy - rocky bodies .",
    "remarkably , there is an apparent `` rotation rate barrier '' in that there appear to be no kbos or centaurs whose densities must be greater than 1  or 1.5  g  @xmath2 ; this conclusion is derived from the case in which rotation periods are identical to photometric periods . similarly , assuming that rotation periods are twice the photometric periods shows that there are no kbos or centaurs whose densities must be greater than 0.5  g  @xmath2 .",
    "this does not preclude larger densities , but means that no kbos or centaurs are observed to have rotations that _ require _ larger densities .",
    "furthermore , @xcite interpret their results for neos by saying that the density that corresponds to the `` rotation rate barrier '' is likely the maximum bulk density for that population . while it seems unlikely that the maximum density for kbos is less than 1  g  @xmath2",
    ", it is nevertheless remarkable that no kbos or centaurs require densities larger than around 0.5  or 1.5  g  @xmath2 . for comparison",
    ", we note that ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath88 has a density around 0.5  g  @xmath2 @xcite ; that the `` rotation rate barrier '' for comets is around 0.6  g  @xmath2 @xcite ; and that this `` barrier '' for neos is 23  g  @xmath2 for bodies larger than 200  m @xcite . since kbos and centaurs",
    "are expected to be a mixture of ice ( density around  1  g  @xmath2 ) and rock ( density perhaps around  3  g  @xmath2 ) , we can roughly estimate that porosity may be important at the level of tens of percent ( see below ) .",
    "a further implication is that kbos and centaurs in this size range generally may not have significant tensile strength , which would allow stable kbo solutions to the upper left of the critical lines shown in figure  [ spin ] ( recall that the discussion in section  [ strength ] refers to cohesionless bodies ) .",
    "this is further confirmation that kbos and centaurs larger than 25  km diameter are likely to be rubble piles . our general conclusion from this analysis  that the bulk densities of kbos and centaurs likely lie in the range 0.51.5  g  @xmath2  is not surprising and confirms results that we have shown above .",
    "finally , we note that the percentage of small kbos with detected lightcurves is significantly greater than the percentage of large kbos with detected lightcurves ( table  [ otherdata ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the arguments presented above : more small kbos are likely to be fragments than large kbos ; fragments are more likely to be non - spherical than primordial bodies ; lightcurves are likely to be produced by non - spherical bodies ; therefore , a greater percentage of small kbos should show significant lightcurve variations than large kbos .",
    "we again restate that the data presented in table  [ otherdata ] is certainly biased against null results and biased toward the detection of small amplitude lightcurves for big ( but not small ) kbos .",
    "nevertheless , if taken at face value , the data presented in table  [ otherdata ] therefore supports the theoretical models described above , with the largest bodies remaining undisrupted since accretion and smaller bodies representing collisionally - derived fragments .",
    "the kbos and centaurs shown in figure  [ spin ] are generally hundreds of kilometers , as is 2000  fv@xmath1 , but 2003  bf@xmath0  and 2003  bg@xmath0have diameters a factor of five smaller : gravity may be important in rounding bodies larger than a few hundred kilometers , but does not prohibit smaller bodies from maintaining various extreme shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore , the same physical processes and interpretations may not be relevant across size regimes within the kuiper belt , and it is possible that better analogies of individual objects are found elsewhere in the solar system , despite differing collision rates and ice / rock fractions .",

    "the physical state of this body is not presently understood , so we can draw no useful analogy from it , other than to say that extremely low densities in the solar system ( including 0.5  g  @xmath119 for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath88 @xcite ) appear to be just that : extreme , but not forbidden .",
    "the maximum asphericity of 2000  fv@xmath1may be only a few percent ( barring pole - on alignment or a pathological combination of dark surface regions along the long axis and bright surface regions along the short axis of an elongated body ) .",
    "the size of 2000  fv@xmath1  is similar to a number of outer solar system moons .",
    "uranus moon puck s axis ratio is close to unity @xcite , but all of these other satellites  which are presumably captured and perhaps fragments of disrupted bodies  are known to be at least 10% aspherically irregular @xcite and amalthea has @xmath120 @xcite .",

    "] , though we note that viewing geometries may play some role ( outer planet satellites , except uranus , tend to be viewed close to equatorially , maximizing lightcurve variations , whereas kbos are assumed to have randomized obliquities that are more likely to hide their true shapes ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite compile a list of aspherical solar system objects larger than 200  km and suggest that the four kbos they observed to have lightcurve variations  all larger than 200  km  may also be irregular , with asphericities of tens of percent .",
    "it is thus remarkable that even modest asphericity of the 116  km 2000  fv@xmath1  is unlikely based on our photometry ( barring a pole - on orientation ) .",
    "perhaps impacts have more thoroughly pulverized 2000  fv@xmath1  ( and kbos ) than satellites of giant planets .",
    "2000  fv@xmath1  would therefore have small internal friction and would be more relaxed and closer to the fluid equilibrium state .",
    "we note that approximately half of the kbos that have been searched for photometric variability show no such signal , typically with sensitivities around 0.1  magnitudes .",
    "this 50% null result could be interpreted as suggesting that many hundred kilometer - sized kbos are less than 10% aspherical . a significant difference between kbos and outer solar system satellites",
    "may be implied .",
    "we can look to the comet population for relevant analogies for the smaller kbos .",
    "@xcite studied shapes of comet nuclei , which are an order of magnitude smaller than the hst kbos and two orders of magnitude smaller than most other well - studied kbos .",
    "they conclude that the primary cause of comet nuclei asphericity likely is extensive mass loss .",
    "we suspect that such a process is not significant for classical kbos , such as the four we observed with hst , that never approach closer to the sun than @xmath1035  au , but could be important for centaurs , which can have semi - axes as small as @xmath1015  au .",
    "@xcite compiled rotation periods and projected axis ratios ( @xmath23 ) for 13  short - period comets and carried out an analysis similar to our section  [ densities ] and figure  [ spin ] .",
    "they find an apparent `` rotation rate barrier '' that corresponds to an upper limit density around 0.6  g  @xmath2 , similar to the upper limit we derive from the double - period solutions for kbos ( filled circles in figure  [ spin ] ) .",
    "comets clearly have non - gravitational forces ( e.g. , jets ) that can affect both shape and rotation periods , so this apparent agreement should not be overemphasized .",
    "nevertheless , the idea that short - period ( jupiter - family ) comets derive from the kuiper belt ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be supported by this agreement .",
    "finally , the asteroid belt includes bodies throughout the size range of kbos and may prove useful for understanding the physical properties of kbos .",
    "2000  fv@xmath1  has no good close analog among main belt asteroids ( using absolute magnitude , lightcurve amplitude , and period as criteria ) .",
    "however , 2003  bf@xmath0  may have a good and easily imagined analog in the main asteroid belt , based on lightcurve amplitude and approximate size : asteroid ( 243 )  ida , which has maximum and minimum dimensions of 55.3  km and 14.6  km , asymmetry ( area - weighted average of the ratio of the radii ) of  1.48 , and an observed lightcurve around 0.8  magnitudes @xcite .",
    "ida has clearly been much affected by disruptive collisions , as suggested by its membership in the koronis dynamical family ; by the presence of its ( presumably impact - generated ) satellite , dactyl ; and by its much - cratered appearance @xcite .",
    "all evidence suggests that ida is a collisional fragment of the ( former ) koronis parent body . note that ida s significant aspect ratio demonstrates , at least in concept , that fragmentary results of collisional events can have substantially aspherical shapes and consequently large amplitude lightcurves .",
    "we note that the asteroid belt has a higher space density of bodies and larger impact speeds than the kuiper belt .",
    "perhaps , however , it is not inappropriate to imagine an icy ida when picturing 2003  bf@xmath0 .",
    "we have derived best - fit lightcurves for four kbos imaged in the hst / acs kbo survey @xcite .",
    "2003  bf@xmath0  is found to experience large amplitude periodic brightness variations , whereas 2000  fv@xmath1  significantly is found to undergo very small but non - zero amplitude periodic brightness variations that are non - sinusoidal .",
    "our primary conclusions are the following :    * plausibly , based on the range of suggested and measured albedos for kbos , an albedo range of at least a factor of  2.5 could exist on 2003  bf@xmath0 , although such unlikely and extreme albedo ranges on single bodies in the outer solar system are seen only in unusual situations .",
    "however , albedo and shape could be correlated , as would be the case with a large , fresh , bright crater .",
    "furthermore it may be easier for a crater or albedo feature to dominate the majority of a hemisphere of a small body like 2003  bf@xmath0 , so we can not exclude the possibility of a wide range of surface reflectance on 2003  bf@xmath0 .",
    "* 2003  bf@xmath0  could have complicated topography that produces lightcurves that  at least during our observing season  are substantially larger than their gross shapes might otherwise indicate .",
    "facets on 2000  fv@xmath1  could produce a small amplitude lightcurve that suggests a body more spherical than its true shape .",
    "additionally , the relatively small deviations from sphericity required to produce the observed 2000  fv@xmath1  lightcurve may be readily explained by topography ",
    "facets  in the presence of low surface gravity .",
    "* the conditions in which small amplitude lightcurves are produced ( e.g. , 2000  fv@xmath1 ) include bodies of any shape seen nearly pole - on ( @xmath26 ) and nearly spherical bodies ( @xmath27 ) seen at any angle . for jacobian solutions  the only non - pole - on fluid solutions in which the photometric lightcurve is derived from the gross aspherical shape of the body  the bulk density of 2000  fv@xmath1must be 0.671.0  g  @xmath2 .",
    "for maclaurin solutions ( rotating spot model ) as well as for pole - on orientations , the minimum density is 2.7  g  @xmath2 .",
    "+ the simplest solution arises from allowing non - zero internal friction : 2000  fv@xmath1  can readily be a rubble pile with density 12  g  @xmath2 and small ( but non - zero ) internal friction .",
    "the emerging picture for 2000  fv@xmath1  is that of a body that accreted to approximately its present size ; has been completely shattered due to extensive collisions ; has little internal friction due to its rubble pile nature ( @xmath57 small but likely non - zero ) ; and is nearly , but not completely , relaxed , thus nearly attaining a rotating fluid equilibrium state .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the idea that the timescale for disruptive collisions among 100  km kbos is longer than the solar system .",
    "the non - sinusoidal lightcurve could be produced by facets or surface topography , or simply as a result of 2000  fv@xmath1  being nearly , but not quite , in rotational fluid equilibrium .",
    "2003  bf@xmath0  ( as well as 2003  bg@xmath0 ) is likely a single coherent fragment , the result of an unusual , but not wildly improbable , collision between 100  kilometer bodies .",
    "we combine the new lightcurve data presented here with all other reported kbo photometry to understand the physical properties of the kbo population .",
    "our general conclusion from this analysis is that the bulk densities of kbos and centaurs likely lie in the range 0.51.5  g  @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the detailed modeling we carried out for the hst / acs kbos and roughly consistent with the average bulk density for short - period comets .",
    "this agreement may strengthen the proposed genetic link between kuiper belt objects and short - period comets .",
    "we furthermore show that the percentage of small kbos with lightcurve variations is greater than that for large kbos , implying that small kbos are non - spherical fragments produced by collisions .",
    "outer solar system satellites of the size of 2000  fv@xmath1   almost all have asphericities greater than 10% .",

    "<S> two other small kbos , 2003  bg@xmath0  and 2003  bh@xmath0  ( diameters 31  and 18  km , with albedo 10% ) , exhibit an unremarkable lightcurve and no detectable photometric variation , respectively . for the larger kbo 2000  fv@xmath1  ( 116  km diameter , assuming 10% albedo ) we strongly detect a non - sinusoidal periodic ( 7.5  hours ) brightness variation with a very small amplitude ( 0.07  mag ) . this kbo may be nearly spherical , a result that might not be unusual in the kuiper belt but would be remarkable among outer solar system satellites of similar size .    </S>",
    "<S> lightcurves may be caused by variations in albedo or shape , and we carry out a study of possible physical states and bulk densities under the assumptions of both fluid equilibrium and finite , non - zero internal friction . under most assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> the densities for the these kbos are likely to be in the range 12  g  @xmath2 , and a plausible solution for 2000  fv@xmath1  is a rubble pile of this density that is held slightly out of the minimum - energy shape by internal friction among constituent blocks that are relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> our interpretation of 2000  fv@xmath1  as a pulverized but essentially primordial object and 2003  bf@xmath0as a collisional fragment is consistent with models of collisional timescales in the outer solar system . </S>",
    "<S> we compile all published kbo lightcurve data to date and compare our results to the larger population . </S>"
