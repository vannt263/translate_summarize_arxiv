    "despite the unquestionable significance of its achievements , like that of predicting the existence of the top quark @xcite , there is no reason to believe that the standard model ( sm ) is the final theory .",
    "for instance , the sm contains many arbitrary parameters with no apparent connections .",
    "in addition , the sm provides no satisfactory explanation for the symmetry - breaking mechanism which takes place and gives rise to the observed mass spectrum of the gauge bosons and fermions . because the top quark is heavy relative to other observed fundamental particles , gev by the cdf group and @xmath0gev by the  0 group , through the detection of @xmath1 events .",
    "] one expects that any underlying theory ; to supersede the sm at some high energy scale @xmath2 , will easily reveal itself at lower energies through the effective interactions of the top quark to other light particles .",
    "also because the top quark mass ( @xmath3 ) is of the order of the fermi scale @xmath4gev , which characterizes the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale , the top quark system could be a useful probe of the symmetry - breaking sector . since the fermion mass generation can be closely related to the electroweak symmetry - breaking , one expects some residual effects of this breaking to appear in accordance with the mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "this means that new effects should be more apparent in the top quark sector than in any other light sector of the theory .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the top quark system as a direct tool to probe new physics effects @xcite",
    ".    many attempts to offer alternative scenarios for the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism are discussed in literature .",
    "a general trend among all alternatives is that new physics appear at or below the tev scale .",
    "examples include supersymmetry models @xcite , technicolor models @xcite and possibly extended technicolor sectors to account for the fermion masses @xcite .",
    "other examples include top - mode condensate models @xcite and a strongly interacting higgs sector @xcite .",
    "an attempt to study the nonuniversal interactions of the top quark has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite by peccei et al .",
    "however , in that study only the vertex was considered based on the assumption that this is the only vertex which gains a significant modification due to a speculated dependence of the coupling strength on the fermion mass : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 parameterizes some new dimensional  four interactions among gauge bosons and fermions @xmath7 and @xmath8 . however , this is not the only possible pattern of interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ , in some extended technicolor models @xcite one finds the nonuniversal residual interactions associated with the vertices , , and to be of the same order .    because of the great diversity of models proposed for possible new physics ( beyond the sm ) , it has become necessary to be able to study these possible new interactions in a model independent approach @xcite",
    "this approach has proved to render relevant non - trivial information about the possible deviations from the standard couplings of the heavier elementary particles ( heavy scalar bosons , the bottom and the top quarks , etc . )",
    "our study focuses on the top quark , which because of its remarkably higher mass is the best candidate ( among the fermion particles ) for the manifestation of these anomalous interactions at high energies @xcite .",
    "a common approach to study these anomalous couplings is by considering the most general on - shell vertices ( form factors ) involving the bottom and the top quarks together with the interaction bosons @xcite . in this work",
    "we will incorporate the effective chiral lagrangian approach @xcite , which is based on the principle of gauge symmetry , but the symmetry is realized in the most general ( non - linear ) form so as to encompass all the possible interactions consistent with the existing experimental data .",
    "the idea of using this approach is to exploit the linearly realized @xmath9 symmetry and the non - linearly realized @xmath10 symmetry to make a systematic characterization of all the anomalous couplings . in this way , for example , different couplings which otherwise would be considered as independent become related through the equations of motion .",
    "we show that in general low energy data ( including @xmath11 pole physics ) do not impose any stringent constraints on the anomalous dimension four coefficients @xmath12 of @xmath13 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) and @xmath14 , although our results can be trivially extended for the other fermion fields , e.g. flavor changing neutral interactions @xmath15-@xmath16-@xmath11 , etc . ] .",
    "this means that low energy data do not exclude the possibility of new physics whose effects come in through the deviations from the standard interactions of the top quark , and these deviations have to be directly measured via production of top quarks at the colliders .",
    "for instance , the couplings @xmath17 can be measured from the decay of the top quarks in @xmath18 pairs produced either at hadron colliders ( the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) ) or at the electron linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "they can also be studied from the production of the single - top quark events via , for example , @xmath19-gluon or @xmath19-photon fusion process @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath20 can only be sensitively probed at a future linear collider via the @xmath21 process because at hadron colliders the @xmath22 production rate is dominated by qcd interactions ( @xmath23 ) . however , at the lhc @xmath20 may also be studied via the associated production of @xmath22 with @xmath11 bosons ( this requires a separate study ) .",
    "also , we will include the next higher order dimension 5 fermionic operators and then examine the precision with which the coefficients of these operators can be measured in high energy collisions .",
    "since it is the electroweak symmetry breaking sector that we are interested in , we shall concentrate on the interaction of the top quark with the longitudinal weak gauge bosons ; which are equivalent to the would - be - goldstone bosons in the high energy limit .",
    "this equivalence is known as the goldstone equivalence theorem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our strategy for probing these anomalous dimension 5 operators ( @xmath24 ) is to study the production of @xmath25 pairs as well as single-@xmath15 or @xmath26 via the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( denoted in general as @xmath30 ) processes in the tev region . as we shall show later , based on a power counting method @xcite , the leading contribution of the scattering amplitudes at high energy goes as @xmath31 for the anomalous operators @xmath24 , where @xmath32 is the cm energy of the @xmath33 or @xmath34 system ( that produces @xmath35 ) , or the @xmath36 system ( that produces @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) . on the other hand , when the @xmath12 coefficients are set equal to zero the dimension 4 operators @xmath13 can at most contribute with the first power @xmath39 to these scattering @xmath30 processes . in other words ,",
    "the high energy @xmath40 scatterings are more sensitive to @xmath24 than to @xmath13 ( with @xmath12 s @xmath41 ) . if the @xmath12 s are not set equal to zero , then the high energy behaviour can at most grow as @xmath42 as compared to @xmath31 for the dimension 5 operators ( see appendix b ) .",
    "furthermore , the dimension 4 anomalous couplings @xmath12 s are better measured at the scale of @xmath43 or @xmath44 by studying the decay or the production of the top quark at either the tevatron and the lhc as mentioned before , or the lc at the @xmath35 threshold ( for the study of @xmath11-@xmath15-@xmath15 ) . since , as mentioned above , the dimension 5 operators are better measured in the tev region , we shall assume that by the time their measurement is feasible , the @xmath12 s will already be known .",
    "thus , to simplify our discussion , we will take the values of the @xmath12 s to be zero when presenting our numerical results .",
    "we show that there are 19 independent dimension 5 operators ( with only @xmath15 , @xmath14 and gauge boson fields ) in @xmath24 after imposing the equations of motion for the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the coefficients of these operators can be measured at either the lhc or the lc to magnitudes of order @xmath45 or @xmath46 after normalizing ( the coefficients ) with the factor is the cut - off scale of the effective theory .",
    "it could be the lowest new heavy mass scale , or something around @xmath47 tev if no new resonances exist below @xmath48 . ]",
    "@xmath49 based on the naive dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "it is expected that at the lhc or the lc there will be about a few hundreds to a few thousands of @xmath35 pairs or single-@xmath15 or single-@xmath26 events produced via the @xmath30 fusion process .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 we will introduce the basic framework of the non - linearly realized chiral lagrangian , in which the @xmath50 gauge symmetry is nonlinearly realized . in this approach , only the @xmath51 symmetry remains unbroken and thus the realization under this subgroup is linear as usual .",
    "we will set up a lagrangian with dimension 4 terms that will reproduce the couplings of the standard model type , as well as possible deviations .",
    "then , in sections 3 and 4 we discuss the constraints on the dimension 4 anomalous couplings from low energy data and the strategies to directly measure these couplings at the hadron or electron colliders . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we construct the complete set of dimension 5 couplings and discuss their effects to the production of top quarks in high energy regime via weak boson fusion processes .",
    "finally our conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "we consider the electroweak theories in which the gauge symmetry @xmath52 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath53@xcite .",
    "there are three goldstone bosons , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , generated by this breakdown of @xmath56 into @xmath57 , which are eventually _ eaten _ by the @xmath58 and @xmath11 gauge bosons and become their longitudinal degrees of freedom",

    ", @xmath48 serves as an infrared cutoff scale under which the heavy degrees of freedom can be integrated out to give rise to the effective operators in the chiral lagrangian . due to the renormalizability of the full theory , and from the renormalization group invariance ,",
    "one concludes that the same cutoff @xmath48 should also serve as the associated ultraviolet cutoff of the effective lagrangian in the calculation of the wilson coefficients .",
    "hence , in the dimensional regularization scheme , the ultraviolet divergent piece @xmath184 is replaced by @xmath185 , where @xmath186 and @xmath187 is the space - time dimension .",

    "we shall discuss how to correctly treat the @xmath14-quark as a parton inside the proton to properly resum all the large logs to all orders in @xmath311 .",

    "hence , the above equality is only valid under the effective-@xmath19 approximation even though the kinematic factors are correctly included .",
    "since the scattering rate of @xmath321 is proportional to the decay rate of @xmath322 , the production rate of single - top event from the @xmath19-gluon fusion process measures the partial decay width of the top quark @xmath309 .",

    "based upon the results shown in figure  [ scale ] , we argue that @xmath352 is probably not a good choice as the relevant scale for the production of the top quark from the @xmath19-gluon fusion process because the total rate rapidly increases by about a factor of 2 in the low @xmath346 regime . in view of the prescription adopted in calculating the total rate ,",
    "the only relevant scales are the top quark mass @xmath44 and the virtuality of the @xmath19-line in the scattering amplitudes . since the typical transverse momentum of the quark ( @xmath353 ) which comes from the initial quark ( @xmath354 ) after emitting the @xmath19-line is about half of the @xmath19-boson mass , the typical virtuality of the @xmath19-line is about @xmath355gev .",
