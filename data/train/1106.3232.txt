    "pulsations have been detected from stars on a wide range of timescales , from several tens of seconds in the case of white dwarfs to several years in the case of red - giant stars .",
    "these pulsations manifest themselves through a periodic variation of the stellar brightness .",
    "pulsating stars can also be found over a wide range of parameter space ( temperature , luminosity ) in the hr diagram ( eg jeffery 2008 )",
    ". a detailed study of the photometric variability of individual systems can give insight to the physical conditions deep inside the star ( eg kurtz 2004 ) .",
    "in recent years many photometric surveys have been undertaken , leading to a corresponding increase in the number of known stellar pulsators .",
    "factors such as cadence , depth , sky coverage and duration makes any individual survey more ( or less ) likely to discover specific types of stellar pulsator .",
    "the rapid temporal survey ( rats ) is a deep , high - cadence photometric survey covering nearly 40 square degrees which took place between 2003 and 2010 ( ramsay & hakala 2005 , barclay et al 2011 ) .",
    "this strategy allows us to detect sources which vary in their intensity on a timescale of a few minutes to several hours .    in our first set of wide - field camera data taken in 2003",
    ", we identified a small number of blue stars which pulsate on a period between 4070 mins .",
    "an analysis of their optical spectra indicated they were sx phe stars or @xmath1 sct stars ( ramsay et al 2006 ) .",
    "sx phe stars are old , metal - poor stars which are likely to be halo objects ( see nemec & mateo 1990 for a review ) .",
    "the @xmath1 sct stars show similar characteristics to the sx phe stars but have solar metallicities and more likely to be located in the thin disk ( see breger 2000 for a review ) .",
    "although @xmath1 sct - like pulsations have been detected in pre - main sequence stars with periods as short as 18 min ( amado et al 2004 ) , approximately 90 percent of @xmath1 sct stars have a pulsation period in the range 40 min to 5.3 hrs ( cf table 1 , rodrguez et al 2000 ) .",
    "sx phe and @xmath1 scu stars have a well defined period - luminosity relationship and can therefore be used as distance indicators and hence map galactic structure ( eg nemec , linnell nemec & lutz 1993 ) .",
    "since we took our first set of data in 2003 , we have obtained a significant amount of further data ( barclay et al 2011 ) .",
    "we therefore have made a systematic search for blue , short period , pulsating stars .",
    "our light curves are typically 22.5 hrs in duration , so the longest period we can determine with confidence is less than 2 hrs . for stars with periods shorter than 40 mins ,",
    "it becomes increasingly difficult to determine the nature of the source based on colour and period information ( cf table 1 and 2 , barclay et al 2011 ) . in this paper , we therefore have decided to restrict our search for blue pulsating variables in the range of 40 min to 2 hrs .",
    "( 14,6.5 ) ( -0.8,-0.5 )    the rats observing strategy is to take a series of 30 sec exposures of a given field using the wide - field cameras on the isaac newton telescope in la palma and the mpg / eso 2.2 m on la silla for a duration of @xmath02 hrs . to date",
    "our survey has discovered around 1.2@xmath2 variable stars ( see barclay et al 2011 for a full description of our reduction process ) . based on their photometric properties ,",
    "a small sub - sample has been selected for followup spectroscopic observations to determine their nature .    to narrow our search for blue pulsators in our rats data , we restricted our search to a range in both magnitude and colour .",
    "the intrinsic colour of sx phe stars is typically @xmath30.1 to 0.35 ( eg poretti et al 2008 ) , which corresponds to @xmath40.12 to 0.14 .",
    "this is virtually identical to the colours for @xmath1 sct stars ( eg rodrguez et al 2000 ) .",
    "many of our fields lie at low galactic latitude and hence have high extinction . to reduce the contamination with other types of sources at low galactic latitudes we allow a maximum extinction corresponding to @xmath5=0.40 ( @xmath6=0.13 for r=3.1 ) . for blue stars @xmath6=0.13 equates to @xmath7=0.13 .",
    "if we add a conservative uncertainty of 0.13 mag in our observed colours ( barclay et al 2011 ) our search region therefore covers @xmath8 , while the brightness of stars were in the range @xmath9 .    here we note that the shape of the light curves and the colour of our sources is similar to some cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; eg szkody et al 2002 who present the first sample of cvs discovered using sdss data ) .",
    "the hydrogen accreting cvs have a minimum orbital period of @xmath080 mins ( gnsicke et al 2009 ) , implying a possible over - lap with our target selection .",
    "( the helium dominated cvs with orbital periods in the range 4070 mins do not show a photometric modulation implying we are not overlapping with these objects ) .",
    "however , cvs show optical spectra dominated by line emission ",
    "although we obtained a spectrum for only 7 out of the 31 new sources  none show evidence for emission lines ( cf  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "moreover , although pulsating blue stars are not x - ray sources , cvs are weak to moderately strong x - ray sources ( verbunt et al 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore cross - correlated the position of our sources with that of catalogues derived from the _ rosat _ all - sky x - ray survey ( rass ) .",
    "none of our sources has an x - ray counterpart within 20 arcsec of the optical position .",
    "in contrast 30 of the 48 cvs with orbital periods in the range 70120 mins in the 2009 catalogue of ritter & kolb ( 2003 ) were detected in the rass .",
    "although at this stage we can not preclude that none of our 31 sources are cvs we consider this rather unlikely .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>,^ , > , > , < , > , > , < , > \" , ]     ( 14,10 ) ( -3,0 )",
    "we have presented evidence that the majority of sources described in this paper are blue compact stellar pulsators . to place our sources in the general context of blue stellar pulsators",
    ", we used the most recent edition of the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs , samus et al 2009 ) to determine the distribution of periods in different classes of short period pulsating variables .",
    "sx phe and @xmath1 sct stars and the longer period pulsating sdb stars all have a distribution of pulsation periods which include periods less than 60 mins .",
    "in contrast , rr lyr and classical cepheids have much longer pulsation periods .",
    "the @xmath10 cepheid stars have a minimum period of @xmath02 hrs . the gcvs notes 131 field @xmath1 sct stars and 20 sx phe stars .",
    "sx phe stars and @xmath1 sct stars have temperatures typically 72007900k ( implying late a / early f spectral types ) , while the long period sdb stars have temperatures typically @xmath02500030000k ( green et al 2003 ) .",
    "our analysis of those sources for which we have spectra result in parameters which confirm a sx phe/@xmath1 scuti nature (  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the observed colours are also consistent with this classification for all pulsators , although for fields with high extinction we can not rule out some contamination from intrinsically redder sources .",
    "however , given that the amplitude of the long period sdb stars is very low ( eg fontaine et al 2003 ) we consider it highly unlikely that blue pulsators are sdb stars .    the light curves of our sources ( figure 2 and 3 ) appear to show regular pulsations periods , some displaying high ( @xmath060 percent ) full - amplitude modulations , while others are much lower ( a few percent ) .",
    "they are similar to the light curves of sx phe and @xmath1 sct stars which appear in the literature .",
    "we have low resolution spectra for a small number of our sources which were taken for identification purposes : they are consistent with a / f type stars .",
    "although our spectra are not high resolution , our model fits indicate that all sources have metallicities which are less than solar ( for most sources at the 3@xmath11 confidence level ) .",
    "higher resolution spectra with good signal - to - noise are necessary to determine their metal content with higher confidence .    in section [ distance ] we noted that the vast majority of our sources are located at distances greater than 3 kpc , with some being over 20 kpc distant ( if we have detected either the fundamental or first over - tone mode )",
    ". similarly , many are at a height of 1 kpc or more from the galactic plane , with several being at least 10 kpc from the plane . some of our sources are therefore at the remote edge of our galaxy .",
    "sx phe stars have been found at both large distances and well into the galactic plane ( eg berstein , knezek & offutt 1995 ; jeon , kim and nemec 2010 ) .",
    "they are therefore , in principal , potential tracers of galactic structure such as streams or the remnants of mergers .",
    "we note that j1356 and j1359 lie around @xmath12 from the large globular cluster m3 ( which is 10.4 kpc from the sun ) which places them at a distance of @xmath02 kpc from m3 .",
    "although tidal tails have been detected at distances of several kpc from globular clusters ( eg odenkirchen et al 2003 ) , no tidal tails have been detected from m3 ( jordi & grebel 2010 ) . the other source of particular note is j0305 which is located in the direction of the galactic anti - center and at a distance of 30kpc ( implying a galactocentric distance of 38 kpc ) and a height of 21 kpc below the galactic plane .",
    "recent work shows that the stellar density of the galaxy decreases sharply at galactocentric distances greater than 25 kpc ( eg watkins et al 2009 , sesar et al , 2010 ) which may indicate that j0305 is associated with a sub - structure of the halo .",
    "alternatively it may be in the process of being ejected from our galaxy .",
    "a more detailed radial velocity study is required to answer this question .",
    "sx phe stars have been identified in globular clusters and nearby dwarf galaxies ( eg olech et al 2005 , poretti et al 2008 ) . based on the number of blue stellar pulsators which we have identified in our survey",
    ", we now make an estimate of the total number of sx phe stars which are present in our galaxy . since our survey is biased towards low galactic fields , highly reddened ( but intrinsically blue ) pulsators",
    "could be confused with apparently much redder sources making potential contamination a significant concern .",
    "for this reason , we therefore base our simulation on those fields for which the total extinction is less than @xmath5=0.45 . a total of 35 fields had a column density less than our limit which corresponds to an area of 10 square degrees .",
    "we find eleven blue pulsators in these fields ( these are flagged in the last column of table 1 ) .",
    "low resolution spectroscopic data exist for seven of these eleven pulsators and a spectroscopic analysis indicates they have a metal content consistent with that of sx phe stars . here",
    "we assume that all eleven pulsators at high galactic latitudes are sx phe stars .",
    "we use a simulation of the galactic populations found in the fields to extrapolate the number of sx phe stars found in the whole galaxy .",
    "our simulation uses a modified version of a model originally developed for populations of hot evolved stars ( napiwotzki 2008 ) .",
    "thin disc , thick disc and halo populations are included in our simulations , while the scale height adopted for the thick disk is 800 pc .",
    "the halo is modelled as an oblate ellipsoid with axis ratio @xmath13 = 0.76 . reddening is included in a simple approximation .",
    "further details are given in table  3 of robin et al .",
    "no self - consistant modelling of the evolution of main sequence stars and possible binary channels , which might lead to the formation of sx  phe stars , is performed .",
    "we assume that the absolute brightness of sx  phe is randomly distributed within the observed interval @xmath14 ( which is the implied absolute magnitude for sx phe stars with periods of 21 hr respectively , mcnamara 1997 ) and that the space density of sx  phe is simply proportional to the density of the parent population .",
    "this should be a good approximation for the field population in which dynamical interaction plays a very small role .",
    "sx  phe stars are observed in globular clusters and are known to be metal poor .",
    "thus it is clear that the thin disk can be ruled out as the parent population , but both the thick disk and halo populations , are feasible .",
    "the thick disk population is almost as old as the galactic halo and some stars of this population have quite low metallicities .",
    "however , some thick disk stars have overall abundances comparable to thin disk stars ( bensby , feltzing & lundstrm 2003 , fuhrmann 2004 ) . depending on the degree of this fraction and noting that the sx  phe phenomenon is linked to metallicity",
    ", different formation efficiencies can be expected .",
    "we make two extreme assumptions to constrain the galactic sx  phe population : 1 ) thick disk and halo have the same formation efficiency or 2 ) sx  phe stars are only formed from halo stars .",
    "a total of 250 million sx  phe was simulated , making the statistical error of the monte carlo simulation negligible .",
    "we obtained a cumulative distribution of sx phe stars as function of limiting magnitude .",
    "a catalogue of simulated stars in @xmath15 fields around the central coordinates of the rats fields and brighter than the detection limit of sx  phe variables ( @xmath16 [ for blue stars this implies @xmath17=22 ] ) was produced .",
    "stars in this list were weighted with the effective field of view of the cameras ( barclay et al 2011 ) .",
    "simulated star numbers were scaled according to the predicted number of stars and the observed number of stars ( 11 in the low extinction fields ) .",
    "the result is that we predict 6.6@xmath18 sx  phe stars brighter than ( @xmath16 ) in our galaxy if a mix of halo and thick disk is assumed and 4.0@xmath18 if only the halo population contributes .",
    "recent determinations of the dynamical mass of the milky way include @xmath19 @xmath20(watkins , evans & an 2010 ) and @xmath21 @xmath20(sakamoto et al 2003 ) .",
    "however , given that the mass of the milky way is thought to be dominated by dark matter , the stellar mass is expected to be 1/20 of the dynamical mass ( eg moore et al 1999 ) , giving a stellar mass in the range @xmath22 @xmath20 .",
    "our simulations therefore imply one sx phe star per 7.6@xmath23 stars and that sx phe stars are significantly less abundant per unit mass in our galaxy compared to than that found in globular clusters ( eg one per @xmath24 @xmath20for @xmath25 cen , olech et al 2005 ) and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( eg one per @xmath26 @xmath20for the fornax dsph , poretti et al 2008 ) .",
    "( we have assumed no dark matter is present in globular clusters and used the results of @xmath27okas 2009 in determining the stellar mass of the fornax dsph ) .",
    "given we have assumed that all eleven stars at low galactic latitude are sx phe stars ( and the spectra of seven are consistent with this ) our estimate of the number of sx phe stars in our galaxy may be an overestimate , indicating an even greater discrepancy between the relative number of sx phe stars in our the galaxy and other nearby stellar groups .",
    "although there is some uncertainty in the number of bona fide sx phe stars in our survey , the discrepancy between the numbers of sx phe stars predicted in our galaxy and nearby stellar systems is over an order of magnitude .",
    "the fact that sx phe stars are less abundant in our galaxy is presumably a consequence of the metallicity and star formation history of these systems .",
    "a comprehensive study of the number of sx phe stars in different environments could lead to a better understanding of how these stars are formed .",
    "we have identified 31 blue pulsating objects for which we have evidence that they are candidate sx phe or @xmath1 sct stars .",
    "these pulsators which have periods between 5183 mins are well suited to being discovered using surveys like rats which have high cadence but have a relatively short overall duration .",
    "unlike the rr lyrae stars which have a longer pulsation period and corresponding brighter absolute magnitude , they have been little used to identify galactic sub - structure .",
    "our results suggest that existing survey telescopes would be well suited to the discovery of sx phe and @xmath1 sct stars if their cadence was high enough .",
    "further , if the mode of pulsation can be identified then they would provide a useful cross - calibration set for luminosity - period relationships and how this is affected by metallicity .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained using the isaac newton telescope , the william herschel telescope on la palma ( the ing ) ; the mpg / eso 2.2 m and eso 3.6 m telescopes at the european southern observatory , la silla , chile under programmes 075.d-0111(a ) and 079.d-0621(a ) .",
    "we thank the staff of the ing and eso for their help in obtaining these observations .",
    "this paper also uses data obtained using the 1.9 m telescope of the south african astronomical observatory , sutherland , south africa and the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope .",
    "we thank the referee for pointing out the issues surrounding the identification of the mode of pulsation and michael lemke for the grid of models spectra computed for a ` a quick project ' .",
