    "the property of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been studied in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the discovery of large elliptic flow @xmath2 at rhic , as large as hydrodynamical prediction with nearly perfect fluid , has revealed a new property of the qgp : strongly interacting nature of qgp @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic radiation , i.e. photons and dileptons , from matter under dynamical evolution carries clean information on the created hot matter . in experiment ,",
    "the other sources for the electromagnetic radiation , such as drell - yan process and hadronic decays , can be estimated so that the radiation from the dynamical medium can be isolated .",
    "recently , phenix collaboration at rhic found a low - mass enhancement of the dielectron spectra @xcite , which is attributed to the radiation from dynamical medium .",
    "we study the connection between the low - mass enhancement and transport peak in the spectral function by utilizing the medium profile calculated by the full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic model with the lattice equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "radiation spectrum of a lepton pair with momentum @xmath3 and @xmath4 from a unit spacetime volume of thermal medium with temperature @xmath5 is given by @xmath6\\rangle_t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the electric current of quarks , @xmath8 is the retarded green function , and @xmath9 is the spectral function . previous phenomenological studies on dilepton production from heavy ion collisions at sps and at rhic suggest that novel production process is taking place at rhic @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the spectral function in hadronic phase has been calculated on the basis of hadronic many - body theory and/or chiral symmetry principles and that in qgp phase on the basis of perturbation theory .",
    "non - perturbative process such as transport process in qgp phase and crossover region has not been considered seriously and may be one of the candidates for the novel production process and we study it in detail .",
    "starting from israel - stewart theory @xcite for causal dissipative hydrodynamics in landau frame with external electromagnetic field @xmath10 and performing linear analysis , we obtain linear equations for the external field and induced electric current @xmath11 ( for qgp with vanishing baryon chemical potential @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 where we introduce three transport coefficients @xmath0  ( diffusion constant ) , @xmath14  ( conductivity ) , and @xmath1  ( relaxation time ) and @xmath15 is the external electric field . applying the linear response relation @xmath16 , we obtain transport peaks in the two independent components of the spectral function : @xmath17 since dilepton rate is proportional to @xmath18 , the dilepton rate from transport peak at @xmath19 becomes divergent . setting @xmath20 ,",
    "the transport peak is @xmath21 .",
    "the transport peak at fixed @xmath22 becomes stronger for larger @xmath23 and @xmath0 and for smaller @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is as follows : when @xmath0 is large and @xmath1 is small , strong electric current is swiftly induced by the electric charge fluctuation , which is proportional to the susceptibility @xmath23 .",
    "this strong induced current emits a large number of photons and dileptons .",

    "[ fig](c ) some of such parameter sets @xmath34 and theoretical estimates by pqcd and ads / cft .",
    "the transport spectral function is proportional to @xmath23 , which rapidly grows at high temperature .",
    "the dilepton production is proportional not only to the spectral function but also to the spacetime volume , which is large at low temperature .",
    "therefore it is interesting to see the interplay between these competing effects , namely fluctuation and volume . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig](d ) is the spectra of dielectrons emitted from the matter with different temperature regions .",
    "clearly dielectrons are emitted dominantly from the matter with @xmath35 gev , suggesting that the fluctuation becomes important at high temperature .",
    "we have calculated the dielectron yield by combining the transport peak and the medium evolution calculated by the full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic model with the lattice eos and attempted to extract the transport coefficients from the data .",
    "we summarize our results in fig .",
    "[ fig](c ) .",
    "the obtained parameter sets are far from both weak - coupling pqcd calculation and strong - coupling calculation on the basis of the ads / cft correspondence .",
