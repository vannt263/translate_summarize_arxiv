    "the investigation of quantum entanglement and its manipulation has been of significance given the relevance of entanglement as a resource , e.g. , for quantum information .",
    "a particularly important aspect is the transfer of entanglement , specially if one has the purpose of building a quantum network .",
    "recently , we have seen the introduction of schemes termed  entanglement reciprocation \" , in which quantum entanglement is transferred from discrete to continuous variables systems and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "such processes of course widen the possibilities for entanglement storage for further use ; in the proposed methods , `` flying '' quantum systems ( atoms ) may deposit entanglement to `` stationary '' quantum systems ( cavity fields ) . in a similar fashion , entanglement can be subsequently retrieved back to flying qubits ( e.g. , atoms ) .",
    "a peculiar aspect of those schemes is that the cavity field states are actually continuous variable states built from quasi - classical coherent states , rather than being discrete photon states .",
    "interestingly , in the scheme presented in @xcite , it is shown the possibility of storing one e - bit of entanglement for specific ranges of values of the atom - field interaction time and @xmath0 , the amplitude of the initial coherent state in the cavities , and having a success probability of 25% .",
    "in fact , atoms interacting with continuous variables fields could allow more than one ebit of entanglement to be accumulated , even without using entanglement as a resource @xcite .",
    "it would be of importance , though , to seek for more flexible schemes of atom - field and field - atom entanglement transfer .",
    "a different proposal is found in reference @xcite , where it is discussed a model in which auxiliary classical driving fields are injected inside the cavities ( initially in the vacuum state ) at the same time that they are crossed by the atoms .",
    "the authors show that it is possible to achieve a complete transfer of entanglement from qubits ( atoms ) to continuous variables ( cavity fields ) and vice - versa . here",
    "we propose an alternative scheme for entanglement reciprocation in which it is possible to deposit one e - bit of entanglement in continuous variables states but without the need of classical auxiliary fields .",
    "this is made possible for a wide range of interaction times , and we show that one may also retrieve the stored entanglement with an efficiency of 100% . in our scheme , two three - level atoms in a specific lambda configuration are sent across two spacially separated cavities previously prepared in single mode coherent states .",
    "the atomic upper level is assumed to be highly detuned from the field , in such a way that we end up with an effective hamiltonian describing the atom - field coupling inside the cavities .",
    "after the interaction is accomplished and the atoms leave the cavities , they have their internal states measured . as a result ,",
    "the cavities collapse in entangled continuous variables states having up to one e - bit of entanglement .",
    "once entanglement is stored in the system of cavities , we show that it can be fully retrieved , for instance , by two independent flying atoms crossing the cavities again , i.e. , the scheme here proposed allows entanglement reciprocation in a straightforward way .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present our model with its solution . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the process of entanglement transfer from atoms to the field , and in sec .",
    "iv the reverse process .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "v. we also include an appendix with a detailed derivation of our effective hamiltonian .",
    "we consider that initially two identical three - level atoms conveniently prepared in a maximally entangled state are sent through two independent high - q cavities . the atoms , in a lambda configuration ,",
    "are assumed to have two ground states ( here denoted as @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) having an energy separation @xmath3 between them .",
    "the excited state @xmath4 is such that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the frequency of the single mode field , as shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "we would like to obtain an effective hamiltonian in the regime of high atom - field detuning .",
    "this may be accomplished if we take the limit @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the atom - field couplings ) .",
    "we also assume two close ground states , in the sense that @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian ( its derivation may be found in the appendix ) considering terms up to the first order of @xmath11 is @xmath12 \\sigma_{g_{1}g_{1}}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ e_{g_{1 } } + \\hbar\\delta - \\hbar\\frac{g_{2}^{2}}{\\delta } \\left ( 1+\\varepsilon \\right ) a^{\\dag } a \\right ] \\sigma_{g_{2}g_{2 } } , \\nonumber \\\\   h_{e}^{1 } & = & \\hbar \\lambda a^{\\dag } a ( \\sigma_{g_{2}g_{1 } } + \\sigma_{g_{1}g_{2 } } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the effective coupling constant , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are the photon creation ( anihilation ) operators for each cavity , and @xmath16 are the transition operators for each atom .",
    "note the presence of the stark shifts which arise in the process of adiabatic elimination of the excited level @xmath4 .",
    "we would also like to remark that in the limit of @xmath17 , i.e. , the ground states having the same energy , we recover the result of the simple degenerate raman model @xcite . in order to simplify the calculations ,",
    "we assume couplings of the same order of magnitude , more specifically , @xmath18 . under such conditions , the time evolution of the atom - field states due to hamiltonian in equation ( [ effhamil ] )",
    "may be summarized by @xmath19 where the ( unnormalized ) states above are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "now we would like to consider atoms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) prepared in a maximally entangled state and the cavities @xmath24 and @xmath25 prepared in coherent states @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , or @xmath28 after a time @xmath29 we will have the ( unnormalized ) state @xmath30 therefore , after having the atoms measured either in @xmath31 or @xmath32 , the resulting cavity states will be , respectively @xmath33 or @xmath34 interestingly , one may show @xcite that the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are maximally entangled states ( contain one ebit of entanglement ) , irrespectively of the values of the parameters involved .",
    "this can be clearly seen if the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 were written in an orthogonal basis in which they are expressed by a superposition of equally weighted orthogonal states . nevertheless ,",
    "in order to obtain maximum entanglement , one should avoid specific interaction times , i.e. , @xmath37 with integer @xmath38 , since for those times the cavities will be in a product state . now , if the atoms are measured either in @xmath39 or @xmath40 , the resulting cavity states will be , respectively @xmath41 or @xmath42 for symmetry reasons one may know that states @xmath43 and @xmath44 have the same amount of entanglement .",
    "therefore it suffices to calculate the entanglement in one of them , e.g. , in @xmath43 . in order to do",
    "so we first need to normalize it . from @xmath45",
    "we obtain    @xmath46    with a normalization factor    @xmath47^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following @xcite , we may write the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of one cavity , @xmath48 , as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . we may then calculate the amount of entanglement in state @xmath43 using the von neumann entropy , or @xmath52 in figure [ figure2 ] we have a plot of the von neumann entropy @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 and the initial coherent field amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the entanglement is strictly zero only at times @xmath55 , and that entanglement transfer is relatively robust against variations in the interaction time , especially for large values of @xmath0 , e.g. , @xmath56 , as one may see in the plot .",
    "we could ask what would be the dependence of the entanglement in state @xmath43 on the parameter @xmath57 . interestingly ,",
    "as shown in figure [ figure4 ] , specially for larger values of the amplitude @xmath0 , the entanglement is not very sensitive to variations in @xmath57 .",
    "now we would like to discuss an example of entanglement transfer from the cavity fields to atoms , a step needed to complete the reciprocation process .",
    "let us assume that the cavities had been previously prepared in state @xmath35 ( for instance , using the method described in the previous section after an interaction time around @xmath58 ) and two independent atoms fly across the cavities , i.e. , the atom - field initial ( unnormalized ) state is @xmath59 the evolution under hamiltonian @xmath60 requires the calculation of @xmath61 , which is given by @xmath62 where we have defined the auxiliary states @xmath63 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath64.\\ ] ] now , together with equations [ evolucaog1g2 ] , we are able to calculate the joint atom - field state evolution , @xmath65 , which may be written , if we disregard a global phase factor , as @xmath66   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2 } |g_{2}\\rangle_{1}|g_{2}\\rangle_{2 } \\big [ |\\mbox{aux-2}\\rangle_{a } ( |\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{b } - |-\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{b } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & - & ( |\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{a } - |-\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{a } ) |\\mbox{aux-2}\\rangle_{b } \\big ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & |g_{1}\\rangle_{1}|g_{2}\\rangle_{2 } \\big [   -\\frac{1}{2 } |\\mbox{aux-1}\\rangle_{a } ( |\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{b } - |-\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{b } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & ( |\\xi_{\\alpha_{1}}^{+}\\rangle_{a } - |\\xi_{-\\alpha_{1}}^{+}\\rangle_{a } ) |\\mbox{aux-2}\\rangle_{b } \\big ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & |g_{2}\\rangle_{1}|g_{1}\\rangle_{2 } \\big [ |\\mbox{aux-2}\\rangle_{a } ) ( |\\xi_{\\alpha_{1}}^{+}\\rangle_{b } - |\\xi_{-\\alpha_{1}}^{+}\\rangle_{b } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2 } ( |\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{a } - |-\\alpha_{1-}\\rangle_{a }   |\\mbox{aux-1}\\rangle_{b } \\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] remarkably , provided the cavities are projected to the same coherent states , say @xmath67 , and independently of the interaction time , we may show is expressed in terms of states @xmath68 and @xmath69 . ] that the terms multiplying @xmath70 and @xmath71 vanish , and the terms multiplying @xmath72 and @xmath73 differ only by a minus sign .",
    "therefore , after the projection of the cavity states , the resulting atomic state will read @xmath74 which is a maximally entangled state and is locally equivalent to any other state of the bell basis .",
    "therefore , at least in the ideal case , entanglement reciprocation is possible with 100% of efficiency , i.e. , the entanglement of flying atoms previously prepared may be fully transfered to cavities , stored , and then fully retrieved from the cavities back to a pair of flying atoms .",
    "it is worth mentioning that field - atom entanglement transfer is also possible from different initial cavity states , and the particular initial state @xmath35 has been chosen for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we also would like to point out that if the cavities were prepared in one of the states @xmath75 or @xmath76 , the atomic entanglement as a function of the interaction time and the coherent amplitude @xmath0 has a behaviour similar to the one presented in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "we have presented a scheme for entanglement transfer from discrete to continuous variables which would allow , in principle , a complete retrieval of entanglement back to discrete variables . in that scheme ,",
    "atoms act as flying qubits and entanglement is stored in entangled field states .",
    "our model consists of a three - level atom in a lambda configuration interacting with a single quantized mode field , in such a way that the lower atomic levels are almost degenerate while the upper level is far off resonance from them .",
    "but unlike the two - level atom case , that particular three - level configuration has a periodic dynamics , and quantities such as the atomic inversion ( and entanglement ) will show periodicity . in the case of entanglement",
    ", we note a recurrence of plateaus ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) indicating maximum entanglement .",
    "we remark that due to the proximity in energy of the ground levels , we expect similar quantum properties for the generated fields ( e.g. , entanglement ) , irrespectively of the outcome of the atomic state measurement , as we have demonstrated . as a matter of fact ,",
    "in the special case of exactly degenerate ground states ( degenerate raman model ) , the generated fields will be maximally entangled coherent states ( provided the amplitude @xmath0 is large enough ) independently of the detected atomic states , as in models of that type the interaction of one atom with a single cavity naturally allows the generation of superpositions of coherent states .",
    "we may point out some advantages over previous approaches ; for instance , there is no need of classical external fields @xcite to achieve entanglement reciprocation . besides , our scheme is very flexible concerning the interaction times , i.e.",
    ", precise interaction times are not required in order to to have full entanglement transfer , as seen in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "this is particularly important as it may turn the scheme less sensitive to experimental errors and also help to minimize the destructive effects of cavity losses .",
    "moreover , while the method presented in @xcite has a success probability of @xmath77 , in our method full entanglement transfer will occur irrespectively of the measured states of the outgoing atoms .",
    "in particular , if we had only considered the cases in which the atoms are detected in @xmath78 or @xmath79 , then the cavities would get fully entangled ( one e - bit ) independently of both the initial coherent amplitude and the interaction time .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the coupling of a single mode field with the three - level atom represented in figure [ figure1 ] is @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the coupling for the transition @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the annihilation and creation photon operators and @xmath87 is the atomic transition operator .",
    "we assume that the couplings have the same order of magnitude , @xmath88 .",
    "the detunings @xmath89 and @xmath90 , are such that @xmath91 the effective hamiltonian may be obtained from the full hamiltonian in equation ( [ hamiltoniano_original ] ) via the the application of a unitary transformation , following well known methods of obtaining effective hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "we may therefore write our transformed hamiltonian as @xmath92 where @xmath93 we may use the expansion @xmath94",
    "+ \\frac{\\xi^2}{2!}[b,[b , a ] ] + \\ldots$ ] , to rewrite our hamiltonian as    @xmath95   + \\mathcal{o } \\ , ( g^{2}/\\delta^{2 } ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming that @xmath90 is small enough , i.e. , @xmath96 , as well as @xmath97 , so that we can neglect terms of second order in @xmath98 and in @xmath99 , we obtain as state @xmath4 is never populated . ] our effective hamiltonian in equation [ effhamil ] .",
    "note that if @xmath100 and @xmath101 the effective hamiltonian above becomes exactly the degenerate raman hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of hamiltonian in equation ( [ effhamil ] ) gives us the eigenvalues @xmath102 and @xmath103   + \\hbar \\delta \\left (   \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{1+\\gamma^{2 } } \\right),\\ ] ] being @xmath104 .",
