    "the one - dimensional quantum mechanical potential @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath4 are positive real parameters , was first studied by razavy @xcite . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the above potential ( to which we shall henceforth refer as the razavy potential ) is a symmetric double well .",
    "this type of potentials has been extensively used in the quantum theory of molecules as an approximate description of the motion of a particle under two centers of force . in particular , the razavy potential has been proposed by several authors as a realistic model of a proton in a hydrogen bond , @xcite . the potential has also been recently used by ulyanov and zaslavskii , @xcite , as an effective potential for a uniaxial paramagnet .",
    "razavy showed that when @xmath4 is a positive integer the lowest @xmath4 energy levels of the potential ( with their corresponding eigenfunctions ) can be exactly computed in closed form .",
    "the razavy potential is thus an example of a quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) potential , for which part ( but not necessarily all ) of the spectrum can be computed exactly . a very important class of qes potentials , that we shall call algebraic in what follows ,",
    "are characterized by the fact that the corresponding quantum hamiltonian is an element of the enveloping algebra of a finite - dimensional lie algebra of differential operators ( the so - called hidden symmetry algebra ) admitting a finite - dimensional invariant module of smooth functions .",
    "that such a potential is qes follows immediately from the fact that the finite - dimensional module of the hidden symmetry algebra is obviously left invariant by its enveloping algebra , and in particular by the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , a number of energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions equal to the dimension of the invariant module can be computed algebraically , by diagonalizing the finite - dimensional matrix of the restriction of the hamiltonian to the module .",
    "one - dimensional algebraic qes potentials were studied as such for the first time by turbiner @xcite , who used as hidden symmetry algebra a realization of @xmath10 in terms of first - order differential operators .",
    "these potentials were then completely classified by gonzlez - lpez , kamran and olver @xcite .",
    "there are exactly ten families of one - dimensional algebraic qes potentials , five of which are periodic and the remaining five all have point spectrum . in all cases ,",
    "the hidden symmetry algebra is again @xmath10 .",
    "recently bender and dunne @xcite associated a family of ( weakly ) orthogonal polynomials to the class of algebraic qes potentials given by @xmath11 this construction was immediately extended by the authors of this paper to virtually all one - dimensional _ algebraic _ qes potentials in @xcite .",
    "krajewska , ushveridze and walczak @xcite proved that a set of weakly orthogonal polynomials can be constructed explicitly for any ( not necessarily algebraic ) qes hamiltonian tridiagonalizable in a _ known _ basis .",
    "khare and mandal have constructed two families of non - orthogonal polynomials associated to a pair of non - algebraic qes potentials , @xcite , and the factor multiplying @xmath12 in the coefficient of @xmath13 in the recursion relation ( 11 ) should be @xmath14 , this affecting formulae ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) . likewise , in formula ( 21 ) the term @xmath15 should be @xmath16 . ] .",
    "it is important to note that the family of polynomials associated to a given hamiltonian is not unique , but depends on the type of formal expansion defining the polynomials .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that one could obtain orthogonal polynomials in the examples studied in @xcite by considering different expansions .",
    "the razavy potential has been recently revisited by khare and mandal , @xcite , and konwent et al . , @xcite .",
    "the former authors , who were mainly interested in the properties of the associated polynomial system , introduced four different sets of polynomials @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) for the razavy potential through the formulae @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes a formal ( i.e. , not necessarily square - integrable ) eigenfunction of @xmath24 with eigenvalue @xmath25 and parity should of course be interpreted as @xmath26 . ]",
    "without loss of generality , we shall choose the usual normalization @xmath28 imposing that @xmath29 one easily shows that each of the four sets @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) satisfies a three - term recurrence relation of the appropriate form ( see   and ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and therefore forms an orthogonal polynomial system with respect to a suitable stieltjes measure .    we thus have four seemingly unrelated sets of orthogonal polynomials associated to the razavy potential .",
    "this is surprising , since in all the previous examples only one set of orthogonal polynomials was constructed for each qes potential considered .",
    "one of the objectives of this paper is precisely to explain how these four sets of orthogonal polynomials arise .",
    "the key to this explanation is the fact ( not taken into account in @xcite ) that the razavy potential is not just qes , but _",
    "more precisely , we shall show in section [ sec.razavy ] that the razavy potential can be written as a polynomial in the generators of a suitable realization of @xmath10 in two different ways . using the constructive method explained in @xcite ,",
    "these two different realizations of the razavy potential as an algebraic qes potential give rise to two different families of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "one of these two families encompasses in a natural way the four sets of orthogonal polynomials of khare and mandal s .",
    "in fact , all the properties of these four sets found in @xcite ( weak orthogonality , factorization , etc . ) are immediate consequences of the general properties of the system of orthogonal polynomials associated to an algebraic qes potential developed in our previous paper @xcite . the second realization of as an algebraic qes potential yields yet another set of orthogonal polynomials different from the four sets found by khare and mandal",
    ". the properties of this family , which again follow from the general theory developed in @xcite , are in many respects simpler than those of the first family . for example , the moment functional associated to the second family is positive semidefinite , while this is not the case for the first family .",
    "all of these facts make , in our opinion , the second family more convenient in practice for finding the exactly computable energy levels of the razavy potential .    in section [ sec.trazavy ]",
    "we study the trigonometric version of the razavy potential , given by @xmath30 this potential , which is a simple model for a one - dimensional periodic lattice , appears in turbiner s list of qes one - dimensional potentials , @xcite , and was also touched upon by shifman , @xcite ( in the particular case in which @xmath4 is an odd positive integer ) .",
    "ulyanov and zaslavskii , @xcite , have related the trigonometric razavy potential to a quantum spin system .",
    "the potential has also recently appeared as the coupling term between the inflaton field and matter scalar fields in theories of cosmological reheating after inflation with a displaced harmonic inflaton potential , @xcite .",
    "the trigonometric razavy potential is the image of the hyperbolic razavy potential under the anti - isospectral transformation @xmath31 , @xmath32 , recently considered by krajewska , ushveridze and walczak @xcite .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that the properties of the polynomials associated to this potential are analogous to the corresponding properties for the hyperbolic razavy potential . that this is indeed the case is shown in section  [ sec.trazavy ] , where we prove that the potential can be realized in two different ways as an algebraic qes potential . as in the hyperbolic case ,",
    "each of these two different realizations gives rise to a family of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "for each positive integer value of @xmath4 it is possible to exactly compute @xmath4 eigenfunctions ( with their corresponding energies ) of the trigonometric razavy potential by purely algebraic procedures .",
    "it was previously known on general grounds @xcite that the energies of these @xmath4 eigenfunctions must be boundary points of allowed bands ( or , equivalently , gaps ) in the energy spectrum of the periodic potential . in section [ sec.trazavy ]",
    "we investigate the exact position of these boundary points in the spectrum of .",
    "we will show that , if the gaps in the energy spectrum are numbered consecutively in order of increasing energy , these points yield precisely the ground state ( when @xmath4 is odd ) and the lowest @xmath33 $ ] gaps$ ] the integer part of the real number @xmath34 .",
    "] of the same parity as @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath35 we obtain the first ( lowest ) and the third gap , whereas for @xmath36 we get the ground state and the second and fourth lowest gaps ( see fig .",

    "liouville problem @xmath247 with eigenvalue @xmath243 .",
    "finally , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for @xmath235 the eigenfunction @xmath237 has exactly @xmath248 zeros in the interval @xmath249 , where @xmath250\\ ] ] is the parity of @xmath58 .",
    "a straightforward adaptation of ince s proof shows that @xmath245 has exactly @xmath251 zeros in @xmath249 , where now @xmath242 .",
    "let us now turn to the trigonometric razavy potential , which we know from the previous discussion to be algebraically qes for @xmath2 . for convenience , we shall use in what follows the representation  of the trigonometric razavy potential as an algebraic qes potential . from it",
    "follows that the polynomials @xmath252 satisfy the recurrence relation @xmath253 where the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath112 are given by with @xmath208 . in particular , the coefficient @xmath254 vanishes identically , which in turn implies that if @xmath255 is a root of the polynomial @xmath256 then the series truncates at @xmath257 , and therefore the function @xmath258 given by is a regular , bounded solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "since it can be shown @xcite that the polynomial @xmath259 has exactly @xmath4 different real roots , we can algebraically compute @xmath4 solutions of the schrdinger equation of the form ( cf .",
    "eqs .  , , and )",
    "@xmath260 where @xmath255 is any of the roots of @xmath256 and @xmath261 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath6 . from the latter equation we find that @xmath262 and therefore the @xmath4 algebraically computable solutions are @xmath263-periodic for @xmath4 odd , and anti - periodic for @xmath4 even .",
    "furthermore , from it also follows that each of the @xmath4 algebraic eigenfunctions @xmath264 has at most @xmath6 roots in the interval @xmath265 .",
    "thus for @xmath4 even the algebraic eigenfunctions coincide with the @xmath4 lowest anti - periodic eigenfunctions @xmath266",
    "( @xmath267 ) , and the algebraically computable energies  the zeros @xmath255 of the critical polynomial @xmath256  are the lowest @xmath4 `` anti - periodic '' energies @xmath268 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath4 odd the algebraic eigenfunctions are the lowest @xmath4 periodic eigenfunctions @xmath269 ( @xmath267 ) , and the corresponding algebraic energies are the @xmath4 lowest `` periodic '' energies @xmath270 .",
    "since the gaps in the energy spectrum of a periodic hamiltonian are limited by two energies of the _ same _ type ( periodic or anti - periodic ) , this means that the knowledge of the algebraic energies allows us to exactly compute a certain number of gaps in the spectrum .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath4 is even then we can algebraically compute the first @xmath271 anti - periodic gaps @xmath272 in the energy spectrum of the trigonometric the razavy hamiltonian or , equivalently , the first @xmath271 _ odd _ gaps . similarly , when @xmath4 is odd then the algebraically computable energies are the ground state @xmath96 and the first @xmath273 $ ] periodic gaps @xmath274 or , what is the same , the ground state and the first @xmath275 $ ] _ even _ gaps in the energy spectrum .",
    "in particular , for @xmath4 even we can algebraically compute the _ first _",
    "gap @xmath276 in the energy spectrum of the trigonometric razavy hamiltonian , while for @xmath4 odd we can always compute the ground state @xmath96 .",
    "note also that , since the algebraically computable gaps are never consecutive , we can not exactly compute any of the allowed energy bands .",
    "figure  [ fig.bandas ] shows the first five allowed energy bands for the trigonometric razavy potential as a function of the parameter @xmath8 for @xmath36 .",
    "the differential equation with the potential is well - known in the theory of periodic differential equations under the name of _ whittaker ",
    "hill s equation , _ or hill s three - term equation , @xcite .",
    "it is of interest in the latter context mainly because , unlike the much better known mathieu s equation , for certain values of the spectral parameter @xmath25 it admits so called * finite solutions * , i.e. , solutions of the form @xmath277 where @xmath278 is a trigonometric polynomial .",
    "it follows from eq .   that the algebraic eigenfunctions obtained in this section are finite solutions .",
    "in fact , the converse also holds , namely _ all _ finite solutions are algebraic eigenfunctions .",
    "this follows at once from theorem 7.9 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which states ( in our notation ) that for each @xmath2 the whittaker ",
    "hill equation has at most @xmath275 $ ] gaps of periodic ( if @xmath4 is odd ) or anti - periodic ( if @xmath4 is even ) type . for even @xmath4 , we have shown that there are exactly @xmath4 anti - periodic algebraic eigenfunctions , whose corresponding @xmath4 eigenvalues define _ exactly _ @xmath271 gaps of anti - periodic type .",
    "since , for these values of @xmath4 , there are also exactly @xmath4 anti - periodic finite solutions and eigenvalues , @xcite , it follows from the theorem quoted above that the finite solutions coincide ( up to a constant factor ) with the algebraic eigenfunctions .",
    "a similar argument is valid when @xmath4 is odd .    in order to compare our findings with the classical theory ,",
    "it is more convenient to use the representation . applying the anti - isospectral transformation to eqs .   and of section [ sec.razavy ]",
    ", it follows that the algebraic ( unnormalized ) eigenfunctions can be classified as follows : @xmath279 in the above formulae , the polynomials @xmath280 are defined by the recursion relation  , and @xmath25 is one of the algebraically computable energies , i.e , @xmath281 is a root of the critical polynomials @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 , respectively . comparing with the formulae in section 7.4.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite we easily find that , if @xmath179 is an algebraic eigenfunction of one of the four types  , then @xmath286 is proportional , respectively , to the * ince polynomial * @xmath287 , and @xmath288 , where ( in the notation of ince , cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath289 , or @xmath290 , respectively .",
    "the results of this section can therefore be interpreted as providing a deep lie - algebraic justification for the exceptional fact that the whittaker  hill equation admits finite solutions .",
    "this observation is further corroborated by the fact that other periodic schrdinger equations known to have finite solutions ( in a slightly more general sense ) as , for instance , the lam equation , are also algebraically qes , @xcite .",
    "the above results underscore the close connection between the existence of finite solutions of hill s equation , on the one hand , and the algebraic qes character of its potential , on the other .",
    "this remarkable connection certainly deserves further investigation .",
