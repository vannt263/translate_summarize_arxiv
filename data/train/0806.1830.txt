    "one of the main open questions in astrochemistry is the relation between solid phase and gas phase chemistry in dense molecular clouds .",
    "in fact in these regions ice mantles form on silicatic and carbonaceous grains after both direct freeze out of gas phase species and grain surface reactions .",
    "the presence of icy grain mantles is indirectly deduced from depletion of gas phase species and directly observed in the infrared from absorption features , attributed to vibrational modes of solid phase molecules , superposed to the background stellar spectrum .",
    "icy grain mantles have been detected both in quiescent regions and in star forming regions . in both environments",
    "these suffer from energetic processing due to cosmic ions and uv photons .",
    "ion and uv irradiation cause a modification of the structure and of the chemical composition of grain mantles , that is the formation of molecular species not present in the original ice .",
    "after desorption of icy mantles molecular species are released to the gas phase which could be enriched by species formed in the solid phase .",
    "former laboratory experiments have shown that carbon chain oxides ( e.g. , c@xmath1o , c@xmath0o , c@xmath0o@xmath1 , c@xmath4o , c@xmath5o@xmath1 , c@xmath6o@xmath1 ) are formed after ion irradiation and uv photolysis of co - rich ice mixtures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "carbon chain oxides , namely dicarbon monoxide ( c@xmath1o ) and tricarbon monoxide ( c@xmath0o ) have been detected in the molecular cloud tmc-1 towards the cyanopolyyne peak ( hereinafter tmc-1cp ) and it has been estimated that fractional abundance of c@xmath1o is about 6@xmath210@xmath7 and that of c@xmath0o is about 1.4@xmath210@xmath8 .",
    "these abundances have been explained by ion - molecule gas phase reactions @xcite .",
    "c@xmath0o has also been extensively searched for @xcite towards other objects , some of which are rich molecular - line sources and which together encompass a wide range of physical conditions . however c@xmath0o was not detected in these regions and only upper limits have been estimated . recently",
    "@xcite as well as other o - bearing species , such as h@xmath1o @xcite , oh @xcite , and h@xmath1co @xcite , have been detected towards the carbon star irc + 10216 .",
    "this is an asymptotic giant branch star .",
    "o - bearing molecules are not expected in carbon stars since the bulk of available oxygen is contained in co. in order to explain these observations it has been suggested that the increase in the star luminosity is causing the evaporation of orbiting icy bodies @xcite .",
    "alternatively it has been suggested that gas - phase oxygen - rich chemistry is occurring in the outer shell of the star @xcite .",
    "here we discuss new laboratory experiments which confirm the formation of carbon chain oxides after ion irradiation of co ice at low temperature and give us the possibility to obtain a quantitative estimate of the amount of carbon chain oxides formed with respect to initial carbon monoxide ( section 2 ) .",
    "we present the new detection of the c@xmath0o line at 38486.891 mhz towards the low - mass protostar elias 18 and we confirm the detection of the same line towards tmc-1cp as already reported by @xcite ( section 3 ) . on the basis of our laboratory results we suggest that gas phase carbon chain oxides in dense molecular clouds are actually formed in the solid phase after ion irradiation of co - rich icy grain mantles and released to the gas phase after desorption of icy mantles ( section 4 ) .",

    "however our experimental results were obtained using 200 kev protons .",
    "thus in order to extrapolate the laboratory results to the interstellar medium conditions we assume that they scale with the stopping power ( s , energy loss per unit path length ) of impinging ions . using the trim code @xcite we have estimated that for protons s(200kev)/s(1mev ) is 3.8 in the case of pure co ice . with these hypotheses in mind we have indicated in fig .",

    "as we will discuss below , this time is much shorter than the evolution time scale of dense clouds , thus the observed gas phase abundance of carbon chain oxides could be easily reached even if carbon monoxide is not completely depleted and/or only partial desorption of icy grain mantles takes place .    towards all the young stellar objects observed in this work ,",

    "the comparison between observations relative to solid co and laboratory spectra indicates that different ice mixtures can equally well reproduce the observed band profile @xcite .",

    "detection of the stretching mode band of solid co@xmath1 towards elias 18 and the comparison of the observed band profile with laboratory spectra have been reported by @xcite . however , as discussed by @xcite , the profile of the stretching mode band does not strongly depends on the ice mixture and can not be used to constrain the ice composition along the line of sight .",
    "tmc-1cp is a dense core in the tmc-1 cold dark cloud .",
    "based on gas phase observations and chemical evolution models it has been deduced that its age is about 10@xmath38  years and the density is n@xmath39 = 2@xmath210@xmath40 cm@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus the gas would take 10@xmath41/n@xmath39=5@xmath210@xmath40 years to condense on grains @xcite .",
    "the presence of gas phase species implies that desorption processes , such as photodesorption , grain - grain collisions , cosmic ray induced desorption and turbulence , compete with mantle accretion in this region @xcite .",
    "thus detection of c@xmath0o towards these lines of sight is compatible with the hypothesis that this molecular species is formed in the solid phase and released to the gas phase when desorption of icy mantles takes place .",
    "the results here discussed do not exclude that carbon chain oxides are also formed after gas phase reactions in dense molecular clouds .",
    "furthermore we are aware that further observational data are necessary to confirm these results .",
    "in fact we plan to search for carbon chain oxides towards other sources in particular hot corinos in class 0 low mass protostellar objects where evidence of ice mantle evaporation has been reported @xcite .",
    "one of the mysteries of interstellar chemistry is the mechanism regulating the balance between gas phase and solid phase species .",
    "carbon chain oxides could be key molecules in this field and thanks to its high sensitivity and resolution the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will give important results increasing the number of detected features in a larger sample of molecular clouds .    finally , as far as we know , the detection of c@xmath1o and c@xmath0o in comets has never been reported .",
    "however comets suffer from heavy ion irradiation @xcite and co is abundant in these objects thus we expect that carbon chain oxides are present in comets too .",
    "in fact a tentative detection of carbon suboxide ( c@xmath0o@xmath1 ) in comet halley has been reported @xcite .",
    "a firm detection of carbon chain oxides in comets could also be used to support the hypothesis that the presence of o - bearing species , and in particular c@xmath0o , in carbon stars , such as irc + 10216 , is due to sublimation of orbiting icy bodies as suggested by @xcite .",

    "<S> we have performed new laboratory experiments which gave us the possibility to obtain an estimate of the amount of carbon chain oxides ( namely c@xmath0o@xmath1 , c@xmath1o , and c@xmath0o ) formed after irradiation ( with 200 kev protons ) of pure co ice , at 16 k. the analysis of laboratory data indicates that in dense molecular clouds , when high co depletion occurs , an amount of carbon chain oxides as high as 2 - 3@xmath210@xmath3 with respect to gas phase carbon monoxide can be formed after ion irradiation of icy grain mantles . </S>",
    "<S> then we have searched for gas phase c@xmath1o and c@xmath0o towards ten low - mass young stellar objects . among these </S>",
    "<S> we have detected the c@xmath0o line at 38486.891 mhz towards the low - mass protostar elias 18 . </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of the laboratory results we suggest that in dense molecular clouds gas phase carbon chain oxides are formed in the solid phase after cosmic ion irradiation of co - rich icy mantles and released to the gas phase after desorption of icy mantles . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , thanks to its high sensitivity and resolution , will increase the number of carbon chain oxides detected in dense molecular clouds . </S>"
