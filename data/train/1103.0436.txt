    "the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction in mesoscopic and nano - scale semiconductor structures has been at the center stage of research in condensed matter theory and device engineering in recent times .",
    "the principal reason is its potential application in spintronics , where the possibility of manipulating and controlling the spin of the electron rather than its charge , plays the all important role  @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit fields in a solid are called the rsoi or the dsoi depending on whether the electric field originates from a structural inversion asymmetry or the bulk inversion asymmetry respectively  @xcite .",
    "quantum rings formed at the interface of two semiconducting materials are ideal candidates where the interplay of the two kinds of soi might be observed . a quantum ring in a heterojunction",
    "is realized when a two dimensional gas of electrons is trapped in a quantum well due to the _ band offset _ at the interface of two different semiconducting materials .",
    "this _ band offset _ creates an electric field which may be described by a potential gradient normal to the interface  @xcite .",
    "the potential at the interface is thus asymmetric , leading to the presence of a rsoi . on the other hand , at such interfaces ,",
    "the bulk inversion symmetry is naturally broken .",
    "in addition to this , the topology of such a ring gives rise to remarkable properties typical of low dimensional systems , for example , the persistent current .",
    "the phenomenon of persistent current in a conducting mesoscopic ring threaded by an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux @xmath0 has been established over many decades .",
    "the existence of discrete energy levels and large phase coherence length allow a non - decaying current upon the application of an external magnetic flux @xmath0 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite first studied the behavior of persistent current in a metallic ring , and then many attempts have been made to explore the basic mechanisms of persistent current in mesoscopic ring and cylindrical systems  @xcite .",
    "later , several experiments  @xcite have also been performed to verify the existence of non - decaying current in these systems .",
    "although the studies involving the mesoscopic rings have already generated a wealth of literature there is still need to look deeper into the problem    both from the point of view of fundamental physics and to resolve a few issues that have not yet been answered in an uncontroversial manner . in the present communication",
    "we undertake an in - depth analysis of the band structure of a mesoscopic ring in the presence of both the rsoi and the dsoi within a tight - binding ( tb ) formalism .",
    "we wish to look for a possible method of determining the strength of the dsoi in a simply connected mesoscopic ring . in recent past",
    "there have been a few experiments to measure the strength of the dsoi by optically monitoring the spin precession of the electrons  @xcite , through a measurement of the electrical conductance of narrow quantum wires defined in a 2deg  @xcite or , by photogalvanic methods  @xcite .",
    "several studies already exist which deal with electron spin states in mesoscopic rings in presence of both rsoi and dsoi and the interplay between them  @xcite , the persistent current in presence of so interaction  @xcite and the spin - hall conductance  @xcite using the continuum as well as the tight - binding hamiltonians .",
    "however , an analytical proposal to measure the strength of the dsoi , particularly within a tight - binding formalism , is still lacking , to the best of our knowledge .    in the present work we consider a mesoscopic ring threaded by an ab flux , and work within a tight - binding approximation .",
    "both the rsoi and the dsoi are included in the hamiltonian .",
    "while looking for a way to estimate the strength of the dsoi , we work out a method to calculate the energy dispersion of the mesoscopic ring either with rsoi or with the dsoi , thus gaining a clean insight into the band structure .",
    "this method leads finally to the fact that by making the strengths of the rsoi and the dsoi equal , one comes across an absolute minimum in the conductance of the ring . as the rsoi is tuned , and hence estimated by controlling an external gate voltage , the estimation of the dsoi becomes obvious .",
    "the conductance is calculated via the drude weight  @xcite numerically , and is found to support the analytical understanding .    in the second part ,",
    "we show that the presence of the so interaction leads to an enhancement of persistent current in one - dimensional rings .",
    "in addition to these , we present the detailed energy band structures and the oscillations of persistent current as the rsoi is varied to get a complete picture of the phenomena at the microscopic level .",
    "let us start by referring to fig .",
    "[ ring ] , where a mesoscopic ring is subject to an ab flux @xmath0 ( measured in unit of the elementary flux quantum @xmath1 ) . within a tb framework",
    "the hamiltonian for such an @xmath2-site ring is  @xcite ( and references therein ) , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and , @xmath5 \\label{equ3}\\ ] ] where , @xmath6 @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath2 is the site index along the azimuthal direction @xmath10 of the ring .",
    "the other factors in eqs .",
    "[ equ22 ] and [ eq44 ] are as follows .",
    "0.2 cm = @xmath11 = @xmath12 = @xmath13 .",
    "+   + here @xmath14 is the site energy of each atomic site of the ring .",
    "@xmath15 is the nearest - neighbor hopping integral and @xmath16 is the phase factor due to the ab flux @xmath0 threaded by the ring . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the isotropic nearest - neighbor transfer integrals which measure the strengths of rashba and dresselhaus so couplings , respectively , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . and are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at the site @xmath23 with spin @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . throughout the presentation",
    "we choose the units where @xmath26 and measure the so coupling strength in unit of @xmath15 .",
    "an elementary analysis of the effect of the so interaction on the spectral and transport properties of the hamiltonian may now be in order .",
    "to this end , we consider a mesoscopic ring with rsoi and dsoi , but without any ab flux threading the ring .",
    "the so part of the hamiltonian is then re - written as , @xmath27 \\label{equ99}\\ ] ] which , on expansion becomes , @xmath28 where , @xmath29 a straightforward algebra helps us to recast the above hamiltonian in eq .  [ equ99 ] in the form , @xmath30 where , @xmath31 and , @xmath32 with @xmath33 and , + @xmath34 . 0.1",
    "cm we now analyze eq .",
    "[ hso ] for two different cases",
    ".    0.1 cm @xmath35 * * in this limit eq .",
    "[ hso ] leads to the full hamiltonian of a ring with @xmath2 sites . with @xmath36 , and with rsoi alone",
    ", this reads , @xmath37 to get the energy dispersion relations analytically , we define a unitary operator @xmath38 which transforms the old operators to a set of new operators . with the operators defined in the new basis , and using the discrete fourier transform , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 is the lattice spacing ( and set equal to unity in the subsequent discussion ) , one obtains explicit expressions of eigenvalues as , @xmath41 and , @xmath42 where , @xmath43 . in presence of a magnetic flux @xmath44 is replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "a similar analysis can be done to extract the eigenvalues for the dispersion relations of a ring with dsoi only , that is , with rsoi set equal to zero .",
    "however , in presence of both the rsoi and dsoi one has to resort to numerical methods for calculating the eigenvalues and eigenstates",
    ".    0.1 cm @xmath35 * * the expression of @xmath46 ( eq .  [ factor ] ) plays a key - role in providing a method of estimation of the strength of the dsoi . in the expression of @xmath46 , the presence of the term @xmath47 under the square root",
    "` generates ' an effective site - dependent hopping integral in the hamiltonian .",
    "this site dependence of the hopping integral enters through the @xmath48 term , and is responsible for scattering as the electron circulates along the arm of the ring .",
    "the scattering reduces the conductivity ( the drude weight ) . from the expression of the factor @xmath49 , we see that , in the absence of @xmath18 , @xmath50 , and the the effective hopping integral becomes site - independent .",
    "the transport is ballistic in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath51 the _ fluctuation _ part under the square - root is maximum .",
    "in this case @xmath52 .",
    "the site dependent scattering is strongest in this case , and should produce a minimum in the conductivity .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in the numerical calculations",
    ".    0.1 cm @xmath35 * * we now present numerical results in support of this argument , and in addition to this , on the effect of so interaction on the persistent    current in such rings .",
    "while the results in the former case completely agrees with the predictions from the analytical calculations , the latter results exhibit remarkable variations including a marked enhancement in the amplitude of the persistent current in the presence of rsoi alone .",
    "we obtain numerical results for the conductance of a ring with different values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 by calculating the drude weight @xmath53 in accordance with the idea originally put forward by kohn  @xcite .",
    "the drude weight for the ring is given by the relation , @xmath54 where , @xmath2 gives total number of atomic sites in the ring .",
    "kohn has shown that for an insulating system @xmath53 decays exponentially to zero , while it becomes finite for a conducting system .",
    "we have investigated the variation of the drude weight @xmath53 as a function of the strength of the rsoi for an ordered ring at half - filling .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ drude ] .",
    "a remarkable feature of the results presented is that , the conductivity ( drude weight ) exhibits an absolute minimum whenever the strength of the dsoi becomes equal to the strength of the rsoi .",
    "this has been verified by choosing different values of @xmath18 for a @xmath55-site ordered ring and with electron number @xmath56 . in each case",
    ", the conductance minimum appears exactly at @xmath57 confirming , as argued earlier , that a clear estimate of the strength of the dsoi may be obtained by noting the conductance minimum of a mesoscopic ring formed at the heterojuncion of two semiconduncting materials . as the strength of the rsoi",
    "is controlled by applying suitable gate voltage , the measurement of the dsoi becomes obvious .",
    "before we end this section we would like to point our that the conclusion regarding the minimum in the drude weight remains independent of the numerical values chosen for @xmath17 , and will occur whenever @xmath51 .",
    "however , the question is about the detectability of this  minimum \" . in this regard",
    ", we would like to emphasize that observing the minimum numerically depends strongly on the size of the ring ( that is , the number of atoms taken in the ring ) .",
    "one can bring down the minimum in the drude weight to any desirable value of @xmath18 by appropriately increasing the size of the ring .",
    "for example , though in the paper we have presented results for a @xmath55-site ring with the minima beginning at @xmath58 , we have checked that the minimum can be brought down to say , @xmath59 by choosing a ring with @xmath60 sites .",
    "at absolute zero temperature ( @xmath61k ) , the persistent current in the ring described with fixed number of electrons @xmath62 is determined by , @xmath63 where , @xmath64 is the ground state energy .",
    "we compute this quantity to understand unambiguously the role of the rsoi interaction alone on persistent current .    before presenting the results for @xmath65 , to make the present communication a self contained study",
    ", we first take a look at the energy spectrum of both an ordered and a disordered ring with and without the so interactions , as the flux through the ring is varied . in fig .",
    "[ energy ] the flux dependent spectra are shown for a @xmath66-site ordered ring and a randomly disordered one ( with diagonal disorder ) in the left and the right columns respectively .",
    "clearly , disorder destroys the band crossings observed in the ordered case .",
    "the presence of the rsoi and the dsoi also lifts the degeneracy and opens up gaps towards the edges of the spectrum .    0.1 cm @xmath35 * * in fig .",
    "[ current ] we examine the effect of the rsoi on the persistent current of an ordered ring with @xmath67 sites .",
    "the dsoi is set equal to zero .",
    "we have examined both the non - half - filled and half - filled band cases , but present results for the latter only to save space . with increasing strength of the rsoi the persistent",
    "current exhibits a trend of an increase in its amplitude .",
    "local phase reversals take place together with the appearance of kinks in the current - flux diagrams which are however , not unexpected even without the rsoi , and are results of the band crossings observed in the spectra of such rings .",
    "the amplitude of the persistent current at a specific value of the magnetic flux is of course not predictable in any simple manner , and is found to be highly    sensitive to the number of electrons @xmath62 ( i.e. , the filling factor ) .",
    "issues related to the dependence of the persistent current on the filling factor have been elaborately discussed by splettstoesser _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the persistent current in an ordered ring also exhibits interesting oscillations in its amplitude as the rsoi is varied keeping the magnetic flux fixed at a particular value .",
    "the oscillations persist irrespective    of the band - filling factor @xmath62 , with or without the presence of the dsoi .",
    "the current exhibits oscillations with growing amplitude as the strength of the rsoi is increased .    0.1 cm @xmath35 * * we now present the results for a disordered ring of @xmath67 sites in fig .",
    "[ currentdisorder1 ] .",
    "disorder is introduced via a random distribution ( width @xmath68 ) of the values of the on - site potentials ( diagonal disorder ) , and results averaged over sixty disorder configurations have been presented .",
    "the dsoi remains zero . without any spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "disorder completely suppresses the persistent current ( an effect of the localization of the electronic states in the ring ) , as it is observed in fig .",
    "[ currentdisorder1 ] ( black curve ) . with the introduction of the rsoi ,",
    "the current starts increasing , and for @xmath69 ( blue curve ) , increases significantly ,    attaining a magnitude comparable to that in a perfectly ordered ring .",
    "it is to be noted that the strength of the rsoi is strongly dependent on gate voltage .",
    "an enhancement of the persistent current in the presence of disorder can be achieved even with much lower values of the rsoi parameter compared to what have    already been presented in the figures . to achieve",
    "this one needs to increase the size of the mesoscopic ring .",
    "we have checked this with a @xmath70-site ring where even with @xmath71 the current increases by an order of magnitude compared to the case when @xmath72 .",
    "however , we present the results using a somewhat larger values of @xmath17 for a better viewing of the results .",
    "similar observations are made by setting @xmath72 and varying @xmath18 .",
    "disorder introduces quantum interference which leads to localization of the electronic states .",
    "rsoi , on the other hand , introduces spin flip scattering in the system , which can destroy quantum interference effect , leading to a possible delocalization of the electronic states .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of the persistent current in the presence of disorder .",
    "the competition between the strength of disorder and the rsoi is also apparent in fig .",
    "[ typicalcurrentdisorder ] . for small values of the rsoi ,",
    "the disorder dominates .",
    "as the strength of the rsoi is increased , the spin flip scattering starts dominating over the quantum interference effect , and finally the oscillations become quite similar to that in a ballistic ring . as the",
    "so interaction is a natural interaction for a quantum ring grafted at a heterojunction , we are thus tempted to propose that the spin - orbit interaction is responsible for an enhanced persistent current in such mesoscopic disordered rings .",
    "before we end this section , we would like to mention that the presence of dsoi alone leads to exactly similar results as expected , since the rashba and the dresselhaus hamiltonians are related by a unitary transformation .",
    "this does not change the physics .",
    "we have also computed the persistent current in the presence of both the interactions .",
    "the amplitude of the current does not increase significantly compared to the case where only one interaction is present .",
    "however , the precise magnitude of the current is sensitive to the strength of the magnetic flux threading the ring .",
    "the observation remains valid even when the strengths of the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions are the same .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the spectrum and the magnetic response of a tight - binding mesoscopic ring with rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions both analytically and numerically .",
    "two principal results have been obtained and discussed .",
    "first , after an exact analysis of the spin dependent hamiltonian we argue that a minimum in the conductance of the ring system when the dsoi equal the strength of the rsoi provides a method of estimating the strength of the former",
    ". second , we present numerical results of the band structure of the ring system when it is threaded by an ab flux @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit terms on the energy bands are shown .",
    "this is followed by an exhaustive numerical calculation of the persistent current in ordered and disordered rings in the presence of the spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the result for the disordered ring exhibits a large persistent current , of the same order of magnitude as that in a perfectly ordered ring , in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
