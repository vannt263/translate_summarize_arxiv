    "recently , electron transport through ultrasmall fermionic systems ( quantum dots ) has been investigated intensively  @xcite .",
    "motivation for these studies is the potential application of quantum dots to quantum computers and quantum measurement devices  @xcite .",
    "the transport process can be described using the concept of coulomb blockade , when coulomb correlations are large compared to other energy scales in the quantum dot system . however , a detailed analysis of the conductance and level occupancies of the quantum dot states as a function of an applied gate voltage shows a rich structure , which is related to kondo physics .",
    "the theoretical description of such effects requires non - perturbative methods , and many studies employ wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) .",
    "recently , functional renormalization group techniques have emerged as a new non - perturbative tool to describe mesoscopic phenomena theoretically  @xcite .",
    "while the functional renormalization group equation ( frg ) is exact in principle , for practical applications it must be truncated  @xcite . in particular , most frg investigations of mesoscopic systems use a static approximation ( i.e. energy independent self - energies and higher vertex functions ) , and the hierarchy of differential equations corresponding to the frg is truncated at second order . since frg calculations truncated at second order are quite ` cheap ' numerically in comparison to nrg or dmrg ( density matrix renormalization group ) calculations , it is possible to map out the potentially huge parameter space of quantum dot systems with reasonable effort .",
    "functional renormalization group calculations beyond the static approximation are technically difficult and require a significant numerical effort as is demonstrated in model studies for single quantum particles  @xcite .    the uncertainties incurred by the truncation of the frg are not easily controlled .",
    "therefore , it is worth studying the static approximation beyond second order truncation .",
    "moreover , methods to go beyond the static approximation with reasonable effort should be developed , and the limits of the static approximation should be assessed .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the influence of vertex functions beyond second order in a static approximation . to this end , we develop a method which enables to extract the complete set of ordinary differential equations from the underlying functional differential equation ( section ii ) .",
    "our method uses a different regularization scheme than the one usually employed for fermionic systems , which regularizes the free propagator ( see e.g. refs .   and  ) . our cutoff procedure is adapted from the scheme used in ref .  , which adds a regulator to the action .",
    "we are able to show that the two procedures yield the same set of ordinary coupled differential equations for the standard hard cutoff regulator .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that this set is finite in principle for a fermionic system .",
    "( this is in contrast to bose systems where this set is infinite . )",
    "the number of differential equations obtained nevertheless grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom of the mesoscopic system under consideration .    for quantum dot systems described by only a small number of electronic states , a study considering all possible vertex functions is feasible ( within the constraints of the static approximation ) .",
    "in this way , the limits of the static approximation can be assessed . in order to do that we investigate transport properties of various quantum dot devices with different couplings to the external leads ( section iii ) .",
    "it is shown that consideration of higher order vertex functions is important in order to describe transport properties of correlated quantum dots quantitatively , in particular for systems with strong coulomb correlations . however , in many cases we find that the set of differential equations to be solved develops singularities if we increase coulomb correlations beyond some critical value , and the renormalization flow becomes unphysical .",
    "this is , of course , not unexpected , and just shows that for a quantitative analysis of mesoscopic systems with strong coulomb correlations one eventually needs to go beyond the static approximation .",
    "this will be addressed in a forthcoming publication using the methods developed here but including a wave function renormalization in the kinetic energy term of the action .",

    "( [ method - frg ] ) is to be performed over all relevant quantum numbers .    in order to solve a functional differential equation like eq .",
    "( [ method - frg ] ) in practice , it must be truncated .",
    "this essentially entails a suitable transformation of the functional differential equation into an infinite set of coupled partial or ordinary differential equations .",
    "this set of differential equations is then truncated at a suitable order .",
    "the standard technique expands both sides of the equation for the effective average into a taylor series about a @xmath4 independent vector @xmath15 using @xmath16 .",
    "one then obtains an infinite set of ordinary or partial differential equations for the taylor coefficients of the various powers in @xmath17 .    for most practical applications ,",
    "the truncation procedure described so far is still too general , and we need further simplifications : one standard way to proceed is to prescribe the functional form of the effective average action more specifically : in this paper we assume that the effective average action takes the form @xmath18=\\int_0^\\beta { \\rm d}\\tau \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n\\phi_\\alpha^*(\\tau)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau}\\phi_\\alpha(\\tau)+         u_k\\left(\\phi^*(\\tau),\\phi(\\tau)\\right)\\ ] ] where the ` effective potential ' @xmath19 does not depend on derivatives of the grassmann variables with respect to the imaginary time @xmath4 . assuming the specific form ( [ method - gamma ] ) yields energy independent ( static ) self - energies and higher order vertex functions",
    "of course , more general functional forms for @xmath0 lead to energy dependent vertex functions [ e.g. a wave function renormalization @xmath20 multiplying the kinetic energy term in eq .  ( [ method - gamma ] ) ] , but such a truncation will not be investigated in this paper .    since the effective potential @xmath19 must be a grassmann scalar , its form in terms of @xmath21 is fairly well determined : it must be a linear combination of all possible products of elements of the set of grassmann variables @xmath22 with an even number of factors .",
    "due to the nil - potency of the grassmann variables the number of possible products is finite , i.e. the number of terms in the linear combinations is finite .",
    "since the number of particles is conserved in the physical models that we want to investigate , we only need to include terms with an equal number of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which correspond to fermion creation and destruction , respectively .",
    "here is an example for @xmath25 : due to the nil - potency of the grassmann variables , the effective potential has the general form @xmath26 the @xmath12-dependent coefficients in this expression will be called ` running couplings ' .",
    "the running couplings have direct physical significance : since the effective average action at @xmath13 is the generator of the vertex functions , each running coupling corresponds to an @xmath27-point vertex function , where @xmath27 corresponds to its number of grassmann factors . in particular",

    ", the @xmath12-dependence of the couplings will not always be explicitly indicated .    following the general procedure outlined above",
    ", we will now determine flow equations for the running couplings . to this end",
    "we first expand the effective average action  ( [ method - gamma ] ) about @xmath4-independent grassmann variables @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
