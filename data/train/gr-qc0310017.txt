    "future space - borne gravitational wave ( gw ) observatories , such as lisa @xcite , will have sensitivity in the low - frequency band and will use time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) to cancel laser phase noise .",
    "all the original papers on tdi considered a configuration of three spacecraft interchanging coherent laser beams , and tacitly or explicitly assumed the array to be at rest in an inertial system . tdi was treated in euclidean 3-space with a universal time , in which the velocity of light is @xmath2 and isotropic .",
    "recipes were given for combining data ( time series ) separately recorded at the various spacecraft , delayed by transit times calculated from the inter - spacecraft separations @xmath3 ( i = 1,2,3 ) , in order to remove the otherwise overwhelming phase noise of the laser sources @xcite .",
    "the aim is possible detection of incident gravitational waves of galactic or cosmic origin .",
    "the lisa mission @xcite will have three spacecraft orbiting the sun in a triangular array with the @xmath4 km , and gw detection capability in the band @xmath5 hz .",
    "several tdi michelson - like and sagnac - like reduced laser - phase - noise - free data streams will have different responses to secondary phase noise sources and to two polarizations of incoming gravitational waves from different directions",
    ". a recent study of a linear array of three spacecraft in a single solar orbit ( syzygy ) @xcite uses a tdi combination sensitive to a single polarization of incident gravitational waves , and two others sensitive solely to secondary system noises .    in an important development",
    ", shaddock @xcite noticed that rotational motion of an array results in a difference of the light travel times in the two directions around a sagnac circuit .",
    "two time delays along each arm must be used , say @xmath3 and @xmath6 for clockwise or counterclockwise propagation as they enter in any of the tdi combinations .",
    "shaddock emphasized the need for careful distinguishing of primed and unprimed delays in the tdi combinations for michelson - like combinations , and , to eliminate laser noise from the sagnac - type combinations when the array is moving , he presented new tdi variables related to those originally given by being `` double differenced '' .",
    "cornish and hellings @xcite also considered the effect of rotation of the lisa triangle around its centroid on the tdi combinations , and reported the new data combinations .",
    "summers @xcite and cornish and hellings @xcite further pointed out that the lisa array is not rigid , that @xmath3 and @xmath6 not only differ from one another but can be time dependent ( they `` flex '' ) , and that again the laser phase noise ( at least with present laser stability requirements ) can enter at a level above the secondary noises . for lisa , and assuming @xmath7 @xcite , they estimated the magnitude of the remaining frequency fluctuations from the laser to be about @xmath8 times larger than the level set by the secondary noise sources in the center of the frequency band",
    ". this may not be as serious a problem with syzygy @xcite .",
    "finally shaddock et al .",
    "@xcite addressed the `` flexing '' complication by showing that it becomes of higher order if the sequence of various time delays in the new doubly differenced sagnac combinations is respected in the tdi recipe , and they introduced a new doubly - differenced michelson - type tdi combination to achieve the same result .",
    "they stressed that although all these combinations are considerably more complicated than those originally given for a non - moving array , and their gw response functions are similarly complex , the final sensitivity @xmath9 calculated from gw signal strengths and secondary phase noises @xmath9 is unaffected .",
    "all the analyses above , however , assumed the clocks onboard the three lisa spacecraft to be synchronized to each other in a reference frame attached to the lisa array .",
    "it is well known @xcite , however , that the spacetime geometry - here the sagnac effect - prevents the self - consistent synchronization of a network of clocks by transmission of electromagnetic signals in a rotating reference frame .",
    "this implies that the time adopted by the lisa onboard clocks and used for tdi has to be referenced to an inertial reference frame and that the onboard lisa receivers have to properly convert time information received from earth to the time in this inertial reference frame . within this frame , which we can assume to be solar system barycentric ( ssb ) , the differences between back - forth delay times that occur are in fact thousands of kilometers , very much larger than has been previously recognized by us or others .",
    "the problem is not rotation per se , but rather aberration due to motion and changes of orientation in the ssb frame .    in section",
    "ii , we further discuss the need for synchronizing the lisa clocks with respect to a common inertial reference frame ( ssb ) , and the resulting gw response transfer functions .",
    "we turn in section iii to the derivation of the four - link tdi combinations valid for constant time delays .",
    "we first obtain the `` unequal - arm michelson '' response , @xmath10 , as an example of how time - delay operators can be used for deriving tdi data combinations .",
    "the operator formalism for tdi was introduced by dhurandhar _",
    "we use it in conjunction with the usual subscripted delay notation to achieve a systematic understanding of the `` relay '' ( @xmath11 ) , `` beacon '' ( @xmath12 ) , and `` monitor '' ( @xmath13 ) combinations . with laser stabilization at a level somewhat improved from that used in the original lisa study @xcite , these combinations , now involving different up- and down- link delays , will satisfy sensitivity requirements .    in section iv , however , we go on to use delay time / operator notation to derive `` second generation '' tdi combinations , which account for both the inequality and time dependence of the back / forth optical paths . following shaddock et al .",
    "@xcite , the resulting doubly - differenced combinations , immune to first order shearing ( flexing , or constant rate of change of delay times ) are denoted @xmath14 .",
    "all these new combinations suppress the nominal lisa laser phase noise to levels lower than those of the secondary ( proof - mass and optical - path ) noise sources , and their gravitational wave sensitivities are the same as previously computed for the stationary case . for completeness",
    ", we calculate the remaining shearing effect on the doubly - differenced versions of the system - noise - monitoring combination @xmath15 , denoted @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "laser noise enters these combinations multiplied by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a fourier frequency in the lisa band @xmath5 hz .",
    "we plot the laser noise in @xmath21 for the nominal lisa system and show it as a result also to be below the level of secondary noises .",
    "the kinematics of the lisa and syzygy orbits brings in the effects of motion at several orders of magnitude larger than any previous papers on tdi have addressed .",
    "the instantaneous rotation axis of lisa , and the syzygy array , both swing about the sun at @xmath8 km / sec , and on any leg the transit times of light signals in opposing directions , say @xmath3 and @xmath6 ( @xmath22 ) , can differ by as much as @xmath23 km .",
    "aberration due to lisa s orbit about the sun dominates its instantaneous rotation .",
    "this observation reinforces the requirement that the new tdi combinations of section iii and iv _ must _",
    "indeed , @xmath3 and @xmath6 interchange periodically and so are also time dependent ; this effect is however of order @xmath24 m / sec and is dominated by the effect of shearing ( `` flexing '' ) already recognized .",
    "this large motional effect has been overlooked because intuitively up / down laser links between two spacecraft moving inertially on parallel geodesics certainly appears symmetric in a co - moving frame .",
    "the spacecraft are then seen `` at rest '' and the elapsed light times , or delays , in either direction are the same .",
    "consider however an inertial frame in which two spacecraft are moving with speed @xmath25 along a line , with constant separation .",
    "the times of transit of a photon from one to the other , forward or back , clearly must differ by @xmath26 .",
    "this is just an extreme case of aberration .",
    "there is no paradox !",
    "we have taken the speed of light to be @xmath2 and isotropic in _ both _ frames , and special relativity has taught us that that is fine so long as we properly re - synchronize the clocks that we use as time coordinates when changing frame ( using light beams ! ) the spatial and temporal separations of two successive events along the null world line of a ray of light _ depend on choice of frame_. rays traveling in opposite senses between two moving spacecraft yield different separations in all frames except the co - moving one .",
    "an orbiting array is best described _ not _ by attempting a sequence of co - moving tangent `` rest '' frames , but rather in the barycentric non - rotating euclidean frame moving with the sun ( of course we ignore tiny general relativistic distortions ) .",
    "the usual time coordinate of positional solar system astronomy in principle uses clocks such that c is isotropic . in lisa and syzygy data at the three spacecraft",
    "will undoubtedly be taken and time - tagged in this solar system barycentric frame , and all the up / down delay times used in the new tdi combinations must be calculated from the coordinates of emission and reception events in the ssb inertial frame .",
    "( this is exactly parallel to the time synchronization problem , and its resolution , that has been met by the designers of the gps satellite array @xcite in geocentric orbit ) .",
    "since the motion of the lisa array around the sun introduces a difference between ( and a time dependence in ) the co - rotating and counter - rotating light travel times , the correct expressions for the gw contributions to the various first - generation tdi combinations will differ from the expressions valid for a stationary array @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the corrections introduced by the inequality of the light - travel times is proportional to the product between the time derivative of the gw amplitude and the differences between the actual light travel times . at one mhz ,",
    "for instance , the correction to the expression of the signal valid for a stationary array is five orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "since the amplitude of this correction scales linearly with the fourier frequency , we can completely disregard this effect ( and also the weaker effect due to the time dependence of the light travel times ) over the entire lisa band .",
    "it is clear , however , that over many months of continuous observation of a quasi - periodic signal , the tdi responses have to account for the motion of the array around the sun ( and relative to the gw source ) , which introduces secular modulations in the phase , frequency , and amplitude of the gw responses @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the notation we will adopt is the same as used in the paper by shaddock _",
    "@xcite , ( i.e it is _ different _ from the original tdi notation , e.g. ref . @xcite . )",
    "we distinguish time - of - flight delays by denoting with a prime those taken in the counter - clockwise sense and unprimed delays in the clockwise sense ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .        there are six beams exchanged between the lisa spacecraft , together with the six phase measurements @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) recorded when each transmitted beam is mixed with the laser light of the receiving optical bench . the phase fluctuations from the six lasers , which need to be canceled , can be represented by six random processes @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the phase of the laser in spacecraft @xmath30 on the optical bench facing spacecraft @xmath31 . in what follows we assume the center frequencies of the lasers are all equal , and denote it with @xmath32 .",
    "explicitly : @xmath33 is the one - way phase shift measured at spacecraft @xmath34 , coming from spacecraft @xmath35 , along arm @xmath36 .",
    "the laser phase noise in @xmath33 is @xmath37 , where we take @xmath22 , so that @xmath38 is the light time in the direction from spacecraft @xmath35 to spacecraft @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 is the phase shift measured on arrival at spacecraft @xmath35 along arm @xmath40 of a signal transmitted from spacecraft @xmath34 .",
    "the laser phase noise in @xmath39 is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the light time in the sense from 3 to 2 along arm @xmath43 . for the further delays used in the tdi combinations we use the same conventions , being careful to distinguish light travel along arms with primes or not , depending on the sense of the measurement .",
    "for example , our notation for delaying the time series @xmath44 by the clockwise light time in arm 1 would be @xmath45 while delaying by the counterclockwise light time in arm @xmath43 would be @xmath46 .",
    "as before , we denote six further data streams , @xmath47 ( @xmath28 ) , as the intra - spacecraft metrology data used to monitor the motion of the two optical benches and the relative phase fluctuations of the two lasers on each of the three spacecraft .",

    "<S> space - borne interferometric gravitational wave detectors , sensitive in the low - frequency ( millihertz ) band , will fly in the next decade . in these detectors </S>",
    "<S> the spacecraft - to - spacecraft light - travel - times will necessarily be unequal , time - varying , and ( due to aberration ) have different time delays on up- and down - links . </S>",
    "<S> reduction of data from moving interferometric laser arrays in solar orbit will in fact encounter non - symmetric up- and downlink light time differences that are about @xmath0 times larger than has previously been recognized . </S>",
    "<S> the time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) technique uses knowledge of these delays to cancel the otherwise dominant laser phase noise and yields a variety of data combinations sensitive to gravitational waves . under the assumption that the ( different ) up- and downlink time delays are constant , we derive the tdi expressions for those combinations that rely only on four inter - spacecraft phase measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn to the general problem that encompasses time - dependence of the light - travel times along the laser links . by introducing a set of non - commuting time - delay operators , </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exists a quite general procedure for deriving generalized tdi combinations that account for the effects of time - dependence of the arms . by applying our approach </S>",
    "<S> we are able to re - derive the `` flex - free '' expression for the unequal - arm michelson combinations @xmath1 , first presented in @xcite , and obtain the generalized expressions for the tdi combinations called relay , beacon , monitor , and symmetric sagnac . </S>"
