    "polymeric materials are encountered in a variety of situations in which their tribological behavior is of importance , from sliding of rubber components @xcite to lubrication via surface modification using polymer thin films @xcite .",
    "the fundamental understanding of polymer friction has been the scope of a number of studies over the past fifty years , from which the following two main pictures emerge .",
    "rubber friction involves the combination of an interfacial molecular process and of bulk viscoelastic losses , the respective weight of these two mechanisms depending on the roughness of the substrate on which the elastomer slides @xcite .",
    "schallamach described the interfacial process as the thermally activated formation and breaking , under the applied shear stress , of molecular bonds between the rubber and the countersurface @xcite .",
    "such a pinning / depinning mechanism , which serves as a basis for more refined models @xcite , is consistent with the velocity - dependent friction reported in experimental studies of rubbers sliding on smooth substrates @xcite .",
    "friction of glassy polymers is usually related to plasticity @xcite . in the absence of ploughing ( or indentation ) of the material , _",
    "i.e. _ in the absence of bulk dissipation , friction is found to be controlled by the yield properties of a nanometer - thick polymer layer confined at the interface between the solids @xcite .",
    "now , the issue of surface properties of glassy polymers has recently attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "various techniques have been used for this purpose : glass transition temperature measurements on ultra - thin films @xcite , density gradient determination @xcite , nanoscale contact mechanics @xcite , creep @xcite and buckling @xcite of thin films , or friction force microscopy @xcite .",
    "though some of the results are still a matter of debate , there is a consensus that a glassy polymer exhibits a nanometer - thick surface layer in which the chain mobility differs from that of the bulk .",
    "moreover , the dynamics in this layer is strongly influenced by the nature of the chemical interactions between the polymer and the substrate : mobility appears to be enhanced near a free polymer surface or an interface with a low energy substrate , whereas chain dynamics seems to be slowed down in the case of strong polymer / substrate interactions @xcite .    in this context",
    ", we have recently shown that such a dependence of surface chain mobility on interactions has a clear signature on friction @xcite .",
    "we have performed friction experiments in which a poly(methylmethacrylate ) ( pmma ) solid slides on smooth surfaces presenting different densities of pinning sites available for polymer / substrate bond formation .",
    "we have found that :    \\(i ) at high pinning level , frictional dissipation occurs through the sudden flips of molecular - sized bistable regions localized in a nm - thick layer of confined chains , which responds to shear as an elasto - plastic solid @xcite , and    \\(ii ) in situations of weak pinning , dissipation appears to be governed by a process akin to that proposed for rubber friction .",
    "this suggests that some `` glass - to - rubber '' transition occurs at the polymer surface when its interaction with the substrate goes from strong to weak .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate further the regime of weak pinning by probing the temperature dependence of friction at an interface between pmma and a silicon wafer grafted with an organic self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) .",
    "the contact configuration of our experiments , in which a smooth lens of polymer is pressed , under low contact pressure , on a rigid flat substrate , allows us to probe the shear response of the polymer surface without inducing bulk dissipation during sliding .",
    "our results provide strong support for the presence of a nanometer - thick layer at the polymer surface , which , in the case of weak interaction with the countersurface , exhibits a frictional rubberlike response .",
    "this response results from the combination of viscous flow in this surface layer , and of a pinning / depinning mechanism .",
    "moreover , we show that the pinning dynamics of the polymer chains is controlled by localized @xmath0 rotational motions at the interface .",
    "the experiments were performed using a home - built tribometer which is sketched on fig . [ fig : setup ] .",

    "the load cell is mounted on a vertical motorized translation stage which is used to bring the lens in contact with a flat horizontal substrate .",
    "the value of the applied normal force , @xmath4 , is deduced from the spring deflection , measured by means of a capacitive displacement gauge .",
    "the range of accessible normal forces @xmath4 is 4.10@xmath53 n. the silicon wafer used as a substrate is fixed to a horizontal translation stage and is moved at constant velocity @xmath6 in the range 3.10@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9m.s@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting tangential force @xmath10 is measured to within 10@xmath5 n by means of a capacitive sensor . in order to work at constant normal load during sliding , and to compensate for parallelism defects of the mechanical setup",
    ", a digital feedback loop controls the position of the vertical stage which drives the loading spring .",
    "the silicon substrate is mounted on the top plate of a heating / cooling unit made of a thermoelectric element and a water - circulating heat exchanger .",
    "the temperature of the plate is measured by means of a thermistor glued on its surface , and is controlled to within 0.1@xmath11c in the range from @xmath12c to @xmath13c . in order to avoid moisture or ice formation at low temperature ,",
    "the whole experimental setup is enclosed in a glovebox purged with dry argon , which allows us to keep the relative humidity below 5% .",
    "the contact area @xmath14 between the polymer lens and the wafer is monitored in reflection by means of a long working distance optics and a computer - interfaced ccd camera .",
    "the lenses have radii of curvature on the order of a millimeter ( see section [ subsec : samples ] below ) , which  for @xmath4 in the range given above  yields contact areas typically ranging from 3.@xmath15 to 3.@xmath16 @xmath9m@xmath8 .",
    "contact areas are determined with a @xmath17 accuracy by image processing .",
    "note that the elastic contrast between the polymer lens ( young modulus @xmath18 gpa ) and the substrate ( @xmath19 gpa ) , along with the smoothness of both surfaces in contact ( see below ) , ensures that no ploughing of the polymer occurs during sliding .",
