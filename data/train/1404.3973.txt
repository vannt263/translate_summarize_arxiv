    "generalizes the case @xmath5 .",
    "our work was motivated by earlier work in this direction , in particular by the odd - girth theorem @xcite .",
    "this result states that a graph with @xmath17 distinct eigenvalues and odd - girth @xmath18 is distance - regular .",
    "we recall that the odd - girth of a graph is the length of the shortest odd cycle in the graph , and that the odd - girth follows from the spectrum of the graph .    in order to obtain our results",
    "we will , among others , make use of some results on so - called almost distance - regular graphs by dalf , van dam , fiol , garriga , and gorissen @xcite",
    ". another important ingredient of our work is a new inequality ( proposition [ theo : excesspdr ] ) for partially distance - regular graphs that is inspired by fiol and garriga s spectral excess theorem @xcite ( for short proofs , see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral excess theorem states that , if for every vertex @xmath19 , the number of vertices at ( maximum ) distance @xmath20 from @xmath19 is the same as the so - called spectral excess ( which can be expressed in terms of the spectrum ) , then the graph is distance - regular .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ prelim ] ,",
    "we give some basic background information . in section [ sec : prepol ] we present a few lemmas about properties of the predistance polynomials and preintersection numbers .",
    "these parameters are used in section [ sec - new ] to prove the above - mentioned new characterizations of distance - regularity .",

    "recall also that , for every @xmath26 , the distance matrix @xmath34 has entries @xmath35 if the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath36 , denoted @xmath37 , is given by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "thus , @xmath34 is the adjacency matrix of the distance-@xmath40 graph @xmath41 . in particular",
    ", @xmath42 is the identity matrix , @xmath43 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath44 , the all-@xmath45 matrix .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 is defined as the spectrum of @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 , where the distinct eigenvalues of @xmath46 are ordered decreasingly : @xmath48 , and the superscripts stand for their multiplicities @xmath49 .",

    "consequently , the leading coefficient @xmath157 of @xmath144 must be positive , as @xmath158 .",

    "for instance , this is the case for the cubic graph on twelve vertices listed as no .",
    "@xmath161 in @xcite .",
    "finally , from the same inductive argument used by van dam and haemers @xcite , we have that the _ odd - girth _ of a graph ( that is , the length of its shortest odd cycle ) can be determined from the preintersection numbers as follows .",

    "a well - known example is the _ odd graph _ @xmath171 , whose vertices represent the @xmath25-element subsets of a @xmath172-element set , where two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding subsets are disjoint , see biggs @xcite .      *",

    "this implies that @xmath183 and so , by the assumption , @xmath184 .",
    "hence @xmath0 has odd - girth @xmath18 , and @xmath14 follows , again by the odd - girth theorem .",
    "of course , one of the cases ( but certainly not the only one ) where the hypothesis that @xmath185 for @xmath152 holds , is when @xmath0 is cospectral with a distance - regular graph .",

    "the hoffman graph is not distance - regular however .",
    "from now on , we will use basic results on partially distance - regular graphs , whose definition is as follows . a graph @xmath0 with diameter @xmath25 is called _ @xmath190-partially distance - regular _ , for some @xmath191 , if its predistance polynomials satisfy @xmath99 for every @xmath192 .",

    "first , we need the following characterization of the girth of a regular graph in terms of the preintersection numbers ( cf .",

    "conversely , if @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath306 , then by combining lemma [ oddgirthlemma ] and proposition [ theo : basic]@xmath14 recursively , it follows that the graph is @xmath190-partially distance - regular with @xmath310 and @xmath311 , so the girth is at least @xmath162 .",
    "moreover , by lemma [ oddgirthlemma ] , the odd - girth is @xmath162 , which shows that the girth is indeed @xmath162 .",

    "let @xmath0 be a regular graph with @xmath17 distinct eigenvalues @xmath48 and girth @xmath312 . then @xmath313 with equality if and only if @xmath0 is distance - regular and either bipartite or a generalized odd graph .",
    "note that , from the hypothesis on the girth , lemma [ lema - girth ] , and corollary [ cor : girth ] , it follows that @xmath0 is @xmath205-partially distance - regular with @xmath314 and @xmath315 for @xmath316 .",
    "it also follows that if @xmath19 and @xmath36 are vertices at distance @xmath317 , then @xmath318 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath319,\\ ] ] where @xmath320 , the leading coefficient of @xmath321 is @xmath322 , and hence @xmath323 by lemma [ two - terms ] .      now let us assume that @xmath326 , and aim to prove equality , so that follows and we can immediately characterize the case of equality . then , using the fact that @xmath327 ( by lemma [ properties - preintersectionnumbers]@xmath4 ) , we have that @xmath328    consequently , from proposition [ theo : basic]@xmath5 , @xmath0 is @xmath204-partially distance - regular , and by using proposition [ propo - pdrg = drg]@xmath4 , we conclude that @xmath0 is distance - regular , and @xmath329 .",
    "now equalities in hold for all vertices @xmath87 at distance @xmath317 , and hence we have equality in : @xmath330 .",
    "moreover , this holds if and only if @xmath331 in , which means that there are no odd cycles of length smaller than @xmath18 , so @xmath332 , and @xmath0 is either bipartite or a generalized odd graph .",

    "moreover , when @xmath0 is a generalized odd graph , with odd - girth @xmath18 , then @xmath335 ( this is again a consequence of lemma [ properties - preintersectionnumbers]@xmath14 ) , and equality in follows from @xmath178 ( lemma [ ortho - pol]@xmath14 ) .      by using proposition [ theo : basic]@xmath4 , we can also obtain some related results under the assumption that @xmath312 . with this aim ,",
    "let @xmath336 be the average of the products @xmath337 over all pairs @xmath338 at distance @xmath317 . if @xmath312 , then this number equals the average @xmath339 of walks of length @xmath20 between vertices at distance @xmath317 .",
    "indeed , the number of walks of length @xmath20 between @xmath19 and @xmath36 equals @xmath340 , and hence @xmath341 here we have used that @xmath342 when @xmath343 and , since @xmath344 , also when @xmath345 . moreover , @xmath346 when @xmath347 .      * if @xmath348 , then @xmath349 , with equality if and only if @xmath0 is distance - regular , * if @xmath350 , then @xmath351 , with equality if and only if @xmath0 is distance - regular , * if @xmath352 , then @xmath353 for all vertices @xmath19 and @xmath36 at distance @xmath317 .      on the other hand , and imply that if @xmath87 are two vertices at distance @xmath317 , then @xmath355 thus , by taking averages over all vertices @xmath87 at distance @xmath317 , we have that @xmath356 suppose now that @xmath357 . to prove @xmath4 ,",

    "the proof of @xmath14 is similar .",
    "note that in proposition [ theo - girth++]@xmath15 , it remains open whether the graph must be distance - regular or not .",
    "in fact , it is not easy to find graphs satisfying the conditions of this case . such an example is the perkel graph @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is a distance - regular graph with @xmath360 vertices , diameter @xmath361 , intersection array @xmath362 , and spectrum @xmath363 .",
    "note that @xmath364 , as required in the case @xmath15 of the above result .",
    "moreover , since @xmath365 and @xmath366 , it has girth @xmath367 , so it also satisfies the conditions of theorem [ theo - girth]@xmath4 , and hence any graph with the same spectrum is distance - regular .",
    "in fact , it is known that this graph is determined by the spectrum , see @xcite .",
    "another  putative  graph suggests that the graphs in this case need not be distance - regular .",
    "it is the first relation in a putative @xmath368-class association scheme on @xmath369 vertices , the parameters of which occur on top of p.  102 in the list of @xcite ( with the second relation being the brouwer - haemers graph ) .",
    "the spectrum is @xmath370 , and it follows that the ( relevant ) preintersection numbers are @xmath365 ( so @xmath371 ) , @xmath372 , and @xmath373 .",
    "thus , if there exists a graph with this spectrum , then it will not be distance - regular .",
    "now if you consider the graph in the association scheme , then for both types of vertices at distance 2 from a fixed vertex ( the type depending on @xmath374 being 1 or 2 ) , you can count the number of walks of length 3 using the intersection numbers of the scheme , and indeed in both cases this number equals @xmath375 . however , note that @xmath376 is either @xmath377 or @xmath378 , depending on the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath36 .",
