    "unification models for radio - loud active galaxies postulate that for the weaker fris only the relativistic jet determines the appearance of their nuclei , while in pwerful friis a circumnuclear dust torus adds to the anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the infrared emission from this torus has been used to test unification models , on the assumption that it dominates the infrared output of radio galaxies .",
    "we have assessed the contribution of the observed nuclear disk to the total infrared emission in fri radio galaxy ngc4261  ( a.k.a .",
    "this disk is flatter and has lower optical depth than a typical obscuring torus , but might be responsible for the absence of a distinct uv core .",
    "we have used observations from literature and archives , paying special attention to the infrared data . when possible , we measured both total and unresolved core flux . between 10@xmath0 m  and",
    "1 mm ngc4261  is unresolved .",
    "we will use _ nuclear disk _ for the disk observed in ngc4261  and _ torus _ for the smaller and denser torus in friis .",
    "we adopt @xmath1 , @xmath2kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 and @xmath4kms .",
    "in the total flux sed we detect the large scale radio emission and a stellar peak of with black body temperature of @xmath5k .",
    "both decline steeply towards the infrared and can not responsible for the far - infrared emission .",
    "the core sed shows a typical double power - law shape with a turnover around 30@xmath0 m , as expected @xcite . including only high resolution data",
    ", we find spectral indices of 0.2 and 2.5 for the long and short wavelenght sides respectively . including lower resolution vla data results in a spectral index of 0.1 , while including the sub - mm data results in 0.1 .",
    "these values are typical for fri synchrotron cores .",
    "the 90@xmath0 m  detection is well fitted by the power - law , and due to the large calibration error is fully consistent with the range of spectral indices we find .",
    "therefore we conclude that non - thermal emission is the dominant source for the far - infrared , and find the same to be true for the sub - millimeter .",
    "the 25@xmath0 m  detection is consistent with both power - laws fit , but due to the large error margin we can not fully exclude a more significant thermal contribution at this wavelength . our fit results in a sharp and probably unphysical turn - over ,",
    "but fitting a more physical curved spectrum does not alter our findings ( see below ) .",
    "this implies that the nuclear disk can not contribute more than 50% of the infrared flux .",
    "we have tested this with monte carlo radiative transfer models , using a setup identical to @xcite and disk parameters from observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dust is heated by both the stellar radiation and the active nucleus .",
    "we add a uv  x - ray component to the observed core spectrum which maximizes the heating from the nucleus .",
    "the disk mass , mass distribution and geometry are varied within the constraints from observations . from our models",
    "we find that the disk never contributes more than 10% of the infrared emission ( see fig .",
    "[ refmodel ] ) .",
    "we also find that stars dominate the heating of cool dust , while the agn dominates heating within a 10pc radius .",
    "however , none of our models provide an explanation for the absence of a uv core . either there is more dust in the line of sight than we account for , or the intrinsic core spectrum steepens significantly towards the uv .    within the highly constrained observations , more dust",
    "can only be present in the innermost region of the nuclear disk , which is unresolved .",
    "evidence for a thicker disk within 6pc comes from detections of hi absorption @xcite .",
    "we constructed model disks which have an inflated inner region , with parameters identical to the hi disk ( see fig .",
    "[ density ] . as expected , these models boost the 220@xmath0 m  emission by an order of magnitude , while the far - infrared is unaffected . the inner regions",
    "absorb the core from the infrared to the uv , but by flattening the intrinsic core spectral index in that range , the fit to the observed core spectrum improves and accounts for the lack of a uv core .    alternatively ,",
    "if fris are mis - aligned bl  lacs , they may have intrinsically curved core spectra .",
    "fitting the core spectrum with a model from @xcite we can indeed explain the absence of a uv core with a bl  lac type spectrum .",
    "all model parameters fall well within the observed range for bl  lacs , only the beaming parameter is adjusted for the larger inclination .",
    "since the observations span about 2 decades in time , core variability can be significant .",
    "we therefore allow a factor 2 in our fits , which makes it impossible to distinguish between either solution .",
    "the 25 and 90@xmath0 m   detection are also consistent with both , although there is marginally more room for thermal 25@xmath0 m  emission with the curved spectrum .",
    "however , the curved core spectrum provides much less heating power to the disk compared to our models .",
    "therefore , the disk would be less bright , making it difficult to account for any thermal emission in the mfir , and enforcing the conclusion that non - thermal emission is the dominant mfir process .",
    "in the frii unification models , the role of the hypothetical torus is to obscure the nucleus at larger inclinations .",
    "we have shown that under certain assumptions , the inner parts of the nuclear disk are inflated and do exactly that .",
    "classical tori in friis require @xmath6 , whilst the disk in ngc4261  has @xmath7 , so in that sense , it is not an obscuring torus . perhaps we need to adjust our definition and allow tori to have a range of optical depths .",
    "this would imply that some fris have a torus , although it is optically thin , and the inner region of the nuclear disk in ngc4261  would potentially be one .",
    "if fris indeed have thin tori , there may no longer be need for two separate unification models . instead , there may be a continuous distribution of torus optical depths , in which fris and iis predominantly populate different regions . however , there is not necessarly a sharp divide .",
    "the sed of the nuclear disk is in good agreement with the infrared emission found in broad - line radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "assuming their mid - infrared emission is thermal , this would imply that some friis could also have thin tori .",
    "finally , we would like to stress the importance of using the highest possible resolution data to determine the presence of a thermal infrared bump .",
    "lower resolution radio data include a significant contribution from older electron populations , which flatten the spectrum and thus underpredict the non - thermal infrared emission . in ngc4261",
    "the extrapolation from the total radio spectrum would predict a significant thermal infrared bump , which is obviously not the case .",
    "in addition , we add to other evidence that the far - infrared emission is dominated by stellar heating , which makes it highly unsuitable for testing unification models .",
    "the best wavelength to detect thermal emission from a torus would be between 10 and 20@xmath0 m , where both the non - thermal core and the stellar emission sharply decline , and the torus emission peaks .",
    "thanks to mark birkinshaw for providing access to not yet published iso cam results .",
