    "in various domains of physics a description in terms of fields is frequently used .",
    "hydrodynamics represents a first example in which some fields ( densities , velocities ,  ... ) are introduced for describing the properties of a coarse grained entity  the so - called fluid particle .",
    "later , field theory ( ft ) has been used as a simple and intuitive tool to predict the behaviour of complex systems in the domain of soft matter physics @xcite .",
    "these ft are essentially phenomenological and rely on hamiltonian functionals introduced in an ad  hoc manner .",
    "they focus on a mesoscopic scale description and they are based on a more or less explicit coarse graining procedure . in this context , hamiltonians are introduced to describe large classes of phenomena having similar properties though different in their microscopic details .",
    "this further suggests another type of problems where a ft is extensively used i.e.  the description of critical phenomena . here",
    "also the ft is based on the assumption that a detailed microscopic knowledge of the system is not relevant to describe its universality class @xcite . and",
    "well suited approximations to describe systems with long range correlations or interactions are introduced . in relation ,",
    "field theory is also used to describe systems with the long ranged coulomb interactions . in this case",
    ", ft is constructed using the hubbard - stratonovich transform of the standard partition function @xcite .",
    "better known as the sine - gordon transform in the case of the coulomb potential , it has given rise to considerable literature @xcite .",
    "these approaches give an exact description of the systems properties on a microscopic level . in this respect , they are distinct from the soft matter like descriptions based on a coarse graining procedure .",
    "the sine - gordon approaches introduce an auxiliary field and intricate couplings between fluctuating fields . in our opinion , this auxiliary field is essentially a mathematical tool , difficult to associate with any physical quantity . as a result finding meaningful approximations",
    "is rather counterintuitive and the application of such approaches requires that one be rather cautious @xcite .",
    "+ in contrast to these approaches , our main goal is to show that it is possible to write a ft directly in terms of fields using methods similar to those used in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "namely , we show that it is possible to build the theory around a field , which is a real quantity having a simple physical meaning",
    ". moreover we will show that our ft construction is not only simple and intuitive but also leads to a complete description at microscopic level . in this paper",
    ", we consider systems at equilibrium .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the main requirements which a ft must verify . in section [ sec : definingh ] , we give the hamiltonian on which the ft is based : it contains two terms of different nature .",
    "this leads to investigate the feynman expansion of a purely local hamiltonian with an infinite number of coupling constants .",
    "this is developed in section [ ssec : int_representation ] where some important specific aspects of the expansion are shown . in section [ sec : interactinggas ] we calculate the partition function in the presence of an interaction pair potential . in the next section we establish an exact mapping between our ft and the standard statistical mechanics given in terms of mayer expansion @xcite . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we illustrate on several examples how our approach may lead to new aspects in statistical physics .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we give some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "our main assumption is that the partition function @xmath3 $ ] of a classical system can be described exactly via a functional integral defined according to @xmath4= \\int\\mathcal{d}\\phi\\exp\\left\\{-\\beta h[\\phi]\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath5 is a field , @xmath6 $ ] a functional of this field which we call hamiltonian and @xmath7 is the inverse of the temperature .",
    "+ to use ( [ eq : partfct0 ] ) we must solve several problems .",
    "we have to define @xmath5 and also find an explicit form for @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "it is intuitive to choose for @xmath5 a real quantity as the density of matter @xmath8 for instance .",
    "this choice represents a fundamental difference from the hubbard - stratonovitch type approaches in which two fields are used , one being a complex quantity . in comparison with the standard description of the liquid state , where the configuration space spans all possible distributions of the particles , here",
    "@xmath8 is a function defined everywhere in space . as a consequence",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in  ( [ eq : partfct0 ] ) is related to the space discretization required to calculate the functional integral as opposed to the number of particles",
    ". then we have to solve a new problem , of how to transpose in ft a property mimicking the indiscernibility of particles .",
    "to relate the ft and the usual physics we assume that the average of the field , @xmath9 , corresponds to the actual density of particles noted @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the indiscernibility of particles , the so - called classical statistical mechanics contains the volume of the elementary cell @xmath11 or , at least , after integration over momenta in the case of systems of at equilibrium , the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath12 .",
    "thus we also have to find how such quantities associated with particles appear in a ft .",
    "in contrast to the hubbard - stratonovitch type descriptions which are finite as they represent a rigorous mathematical transformation of a finite quantity , we expect that a field theory , as is often the case , will contain infinities associated with the short scale spatial discretization of the functional integral .",
    "this will require the introduction of a renormalization procedure .    finally , to be able to assert that the ft is also an exact representation , we have to show that there exists a rigorous mapping between the ft and the standard statistical mechanics of dense systems .",
    "hereafter we turn our attention to all these questions .",
    "to build @xmath13 $ ] we follow an approach inspired by the methods developped in qft where instead of @xmath13 $ ] the lagrangian @xmath14 $ ] is considered . to find the latter , we select a functional and check that the mean field approximation of the theory reproduces a well known result ;",
    "for instance , the maxwell equations in quantum electrodynamics . in this case , @xmath14 $ ] can be considered a good choice for elaborating the complete theory including the fluctuations via the functional integral .",
    "+ in statistical thermodynamics , it is only for systems without interactions , ideal systems , that we know an exact and general result and have the explicit expression of the partition function , @xmath15 .",
    "we then consider such systems and require that the hamiltonian @xmath16 $ ] reproduce the thermodynamic partition function @xmath15 in a mean field estimation of ( [ eq : partfct0 ] ) .",
    "_ however , since @xmath15 is a cornerstone in classical statistical mechanics and contains fundamental physics related to @xmath12 and the indiscernibility of particles , we further require that @xmath16 $ ] reproduce @xmath15 exactly , i.e. also beyond the mean field approximation . _ these fundamental aspects will then be correctly accounted for in the ft for all systems including those with interactions .",
    "we shall now discuss the hamiltonian .",
    "having chosen the field @xmath8 so that its average corresponds to the density of particles @xmath10 , it is evident to fix the chemical potential , @xmath17 , and choose for @xmath15 the grand canonical partition function . in this case",
    "we have the exact thermodynamic results @xmath18 and @xmath19 where the exact density @xmath20 is uniformly distributed in space .",
    "a simple hamiltonian @xmath16 $ ] that reproduces ( [ mu ] ) in a mean field approximation of ( [ eq : partfct0 ] ) is @xmath21 = \\int d\\mathbf{r } \\left\\{\\rho(\\mathbf{r } )    \\left[\\ln \\left(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\lambda^3\\right)- 1\\right ] -    \\beta \\mu   \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as for the lagrangian @xmath14 $ ] in qft we can not claim that @xmath16 $ ] is unique .",

    "secondly , we need to compare the combinatory coefficients for the two expansions .",
    "hereafter , we do not discuss the powers of @xmath25 as in the final the graph is proportional to @xmath25 and focus only on @xmath146 .",
    "first we discuss the powers in @xmath63 . from the previous section ,",

    "the role of the one body vertex has to be treated separately . in one case",
    ", the external weight @xmath168 is attached to the ideal system propagator . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_propagator ] ) , the only factor @xmath63 of the ideal propagator is already distributed to the vertex inside the diagram .",
    "one can verify that there remains one factor @xmath63 associated with the external weight @xmath168 and this term corresponds to the activity which should be at the end of an external line in the mayer expansion . in the second case , the external weight is attached to a single interaction potential .",
    "this corresponds to two potentials in series and we can use the two body vertex . we can verify that here also we have the correct number of factors @xmath63 once they are redistributed on each vertex and that we retrieve the standard mayer graph result .",
    "the final statement is that although in the feynman expansion factors @xmath63 are associated both with lines and vertices , they can formally be redistributed in order to associate a single instance of this coefficient to each vertex .",
    "this corresponds to the mayer diagrams expansion where the activity is associated to the points .",
    "the second aspect is that the @xmath175-vertex functions are associated with the standard @xmath77 factor .",
    "this is exactly the correct combinatory so as to obtain the non labelled graphs of the mayer expansion , with identical rules for the symmetry of the graphs .",
    "one only needs to treat separately the case of the external weight , which includes the interaction potential when it is attached to the ideal propagator .",
    "it corresponds in the mayer expansion to a single potential pending from a graph , the topological equivalent of an external branch in the feynman expansion .",
    "the expected combinatory is found in this case too .",
    "the sum of all these results shows that the mayer and the feynman expansion are finally identical .",
    "the result can be extended to the system in the presence of an external field , indeed we have shown that any vertex function can be decorated by a factor @xmath170 .",
    "we have seen above that each vertex function can be associated to a factor @xmath63 , the multiplication of this factor by the exponential corresponds , in the liquid state physics , to the generalization of the activity in the presence of an external field denoted @xmath178 in @xcite .",
    "the foremost result of this paper shows that given the renormalization introduced in section [ sec : renormalization ] , the result for the diagrammatic expansion is simple and leads to the equivalence of the feynman and mayer graph expansions .",
    "we thus fulfil our main objective which is to define a ft capable of describing the system at a microscopic level introducing a simple and intuitive hamiltonian .",
    "this confirms previous results where we have shown that our formalism reproduces two exact results which are the virial theorem @xcite and the contact theorem @xcite which will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "note that in our formalism , there is no reference to gibbs ensembles .",
    "the difference in number of degrees of freedom associated with the field description and the lattice spacing @xmath25 calls for the renormalisation which we have introduced in order to reproduce the correct combinatorics for particles .",
    "from standard text books @xcite , we know that the so - called classical statistical mechanics contains two basic properties governed by quantum physics .",
    "namely , the thermal de broglie wavelength , @xmath12 , and the indiscernibility of particles which originates from @xmath179 distinct particles a @xmath180 coefficient in the partition function .",
    "these elements are not related to the interaction potential . in the present paper",
    ", we have shown that a simple local functional together with a renormalization procedure can reproduce these two properties .",
    "this procedure is not modified when an interaction pair potential is introduced in the hamiltonian and consequently we can then demonstrate that the theory is equivalent to the usual statistical mechanics .",
    "we have shown that the local functional leads , in perturbation theory , to a simple combinatory of the fields . in each monomial term , the @xmath76 fields are equivalent and their permutation is associated with the coefficient @xmath77 . in other words , the local functional transposes to the ft the indiscernibility of particles .",
    "one characteristic of our ft is that we have been able to introduce a renormalization procedure through which all the results are finite and independent from , arbitrary lattice spacing , although there exists an infinity of coupling constants . due to renormalization",
    ", the expression @xmath51\\}$ ] is formal and we must consider that this quantity is defined by its series expansion around the activity and that some terms in this expansion are cancelled by counter terms ; these are independent of the interaction potential , showing that they have no physical meaning but are originated only by a mathematical procedure .",
    "achieving a microscopically faithful description shows that a simple ft is not necessarily associated with a coarse graining and can have a level of description equivalent to that of the standard statistical mechanics , in contrast to the common conceptions of this type of approach @xcite .",
    "indeed , the measure we have used does not require the introduction of any normalization constant in the partition function , necessary in the case of a coarse grained approach .",
    "+ we can also compare this ft with other microscopically exact field theoretical descriptions . considering a field approach without using as a starting point the standard partition function",
    ", we deal with a renormalization that does not exist for field theories based on the hubbard stratonovich transform . on the other hand ,",
    "our field is extremely simple and has an obvious physical meaning .",
    "this contrasts with the hubbard stratonovich type approaches , where we have to work in a complex plane with an auxiliary field for which it is rather difficult to introduce appropriate physical approximations .",
    "we also emphasize that ft is distinct from the dft .",
    "both approaches are based on the existence of a functional of the density",
    ". however , in the two formalisms , the correlations are treated in different ways @xcite . in the dft , the form of the functional includes all correlations and fluctuations and we know that this functional exists but we ignore its exact form . minimizing this functional yields the equilibrium density distribution .",
    "in contrast , in ft the functional is known and simple .",
    "the core of the ft formalism is to gradually account for the fluctuations when calculating quantities for the system in a perturbative expansion .",
    "one part of @xmath13 $ ] is @xmath23 $ ] which is formally like the free energy of the ideal system .",
    "a similar term @xmath181 $ ] is introduced in dft , however it is important to point out the differences between @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath181 $ ] . @xmath23 $ ] is a functional of a field i.e. a fluctuating quantity where as , at the minimum , @xmath181 $ ] is a function of the mean value of the fluid density .",
    "moreover , we have mentionned earlier that @xmath51\\}$ ] is essentially a formal expression .",
    "this illustrates one specificity of the ft  : the fluctuations of the ideal term which basically represent the entropy must be considered on the same footing as the fluctuations related to the interaction pair potential .",
    "+ in this respect , although our ft is equivalent to standard statistical mechanics , the two approaches focus on different aspects of the correlations .",
    "this is the case when comparing standard approaches , but the discussion will be extended below for the case of our ft .",
    "we are convinced that having at disposal distinct formulations for a given quantity is indeed useful , possibly for acquiring a broader understanding .",
    "hereafter we illustrate on three examples how ft leads to a new point of view on traditional quantities .",
    "+ in liquid state theory there are three classical expressions of the chemical potential .",
    "one of them corresponds to @xcite @xmath182 a second traditional expression is given by @xcite @xmath183;\\mathbf{r})+v^{ext}(\\mathbf{r})=\\beta\\mu\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath184;i)$ ] is the single - particle direct correlation function @xcite .",
    "finally , we also have a relation based on a charging process of the interaction potential @xcite @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the pair distribution function @xcite as a function of the charging parameter  @xmath187 .",
    "we note that all these expressions emphasize properties related to the potential , whether calculating the correlations of a quantity involving the interaction , or calculating the single - particle direct correlation function or alternatively considering a charging process of the interaction .",
    "the field theoretical description leads to a new expression which can be obtained by writing that the field is a dummy variable in the functional integral .",
    "this leads to the so called dyson relations @xcite and we obtain @xmath188 here the term related to the interactions is rather simple , it expresses the mean potential at a given point without taking into account the correlations .",
    "all correlations and fluctuations appear in the calculation of the average of the logarithm of the density field .",
    "this contrasts with a simple term like the logarithm of the average density , which appears in standard statistical mechanical expressions or in the dft . as a consequence ,",
    "differences in the description and a different organisation of the perturbation expansion in the ft , suggest that one should be able to elaborate new approximations .",
    "+ let us consider now the so - called contact theorem which establishes an exact relation between the pressure @xmath189 existing in a bulk phase and the value of the density profile @xmath190 at the wall enclosing the bulk material .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath191 in so far as this relation is concerned , discussing the derivation of this theorem is an opportunity to emphasize the conceptual differences between the various approaches .",
    "we mention the kinetic theory of gases , in which this relation is the consequence of the mechanical equilibrium at the interface . in the case of dft ,",
    "the derivation is straightforward as we only need to write a displacement of the external potential  : the interface , in two different ways .",
    "another derivation @xcite is obtained by integrating the bgy equations . in this case , a _",
    "subtle _ integration of the correlations through the interface leads to the relation . within our field",
    "theoretical framework , the key element is the local functional which is essential at different levels .",
    "it is crucial to obtain the density contact value present in the contact theorem @xcite , but it is also necessary to cancel supplementary terms which appear in the demonstration . in this respect ,",
    "specific relations of the field theory are also required , namely the dyson type relations @xcite .",
    "+ now , in a third example , we illustrate one of the main aspects of the ft , i.e. the existence of an intricate coupling between counting ( entropy ) and interaction .",
    "let us study the interfacial properties of ionic fluids .",
    "from the point of view of the interactions , we know that the important quantity is the charge , the difference of densities of each species . however , this system can also be viewed as a peculiar mixture which has a specific condition due to electroneutrality . from this point of view",
    ", we have two terms in the ideal functional describing the indiscernibility for each ion .",
    "thus the natural fields are the densities describing each ion . in @xcite , we show , in the specific instance where the natural fields for the ideal and for the interaction term are distinct , that the perturbation theory leads to a coupling of the charge and of the total density field due to the local ideal functional .",
    "this has direct consequences .",
    "+ for the simple neutral interface , we show that there exists a depletion for the quadratic fluctuations of the charge .",
    "then , the entropic coupling between the charge field and the total density field predicts a non trivial profile on the total density @xcite .",
    "we can verify that the contact value of this total density profile satisfies the exact condition of the contact theorem , for the pressure calculated at the same level of approximation .",
    "we have used this phenomenon to analyse the anomalous behaviour of the differential capacitance as a function of the temperature @xcite which has been thoroughly discussed recently in experiments @xcite , numerical simulation @xcite and theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "the interest of our analysis is that it provides a simple interpretation and understanding for this phenomenon , associating the decrease in the capacitance with the depletion of the ionic density at the interface at low temperature and providing the physical origin of this depletion .",
    "moreover , the more detailed account of these entropic effects is fundamental in the case of asymmetric , in valence , electrolytes . in @xcite ,",
    "we have tested our ft by comparing with the results of numerical simulations @xcite and shown that the theory accounts for all main qualitative properties of the phenomenon , in comparison with other approaches @xcite which although currently more quantitative fail to take certain features into consideration .",
    "in this paper , we present a field theory describing classical fluids at equilibrium at the same level as the standard statistical mechanics .",
    "we introduce a real physical field and construct the hamiltonian in the spirit of the qft .",
    "this functional includes interactions and a local functional representing the ideal system .",
    "the latter characterises our approach and has been thoroughly discussed . in particular , we show that it provides , for the ft , essential ingredients in relation to quantum mechanics .",
    "the equivalence of our theory with standard statistical mechanics is shown by establishing that the feynman expansion of the ft is equivalent to the standard mayer expansion .",
    "the approach is original in that it is not a simple mapping of the standard partition function like other field theories .",
    "consequently , it requires a renormalization which we describe .",
    "its basic interest is that the theory remains simple and intuitive like phenomenological field theories .    establishing a field theory which is both a simple and exact representation of the statistical mechanics",
    "has many advantages .",
    "we present possible applications .",
    "+ some are related to the ft formalism .",
    "we can , for instance , use powerful tools such as discussions in terms of symmetries of the system , of the fields @xcite . also , the fact of having a field variable at the microscopic level should allow for natural bridging with the mesoscopic intuitive approaches which also adopt the field theory description .",
    "an example can be found in @xcite where a mesoscopic hamiltonian is presented . +",
    "another aspect is that this formalism treats fluctuations in a different way .",
    "this type of approach would help elaborating small systems , where fluctuations can have the same magnitude as the quantities characterising the system @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we have also shown that there is an emphasis on correlations associated with entropic effects .",
    "such emphasis should shed new light on the description of ionic systems , or mixtures .",
    "for instance , we believe that the emphasis on the correlations between charge and total density could add to the understanding of criticality in ionic systems . for such systems , the potential couples the charge , whereas criticality characterizes a phenomenon on the total density .",
    "another system of interest in the field of the double layer is the study of asymmetric in charge electrolytes , which exhibit polarization phenomena even in the vicinity of neutral interfaces . as opposed to asymmetric in size ions , this phenomenon is not intuitive .",
    "the difference of density of anions and cations for these asymmetric systems seems to be the origin of such phenomena as a consequence again of entropic effects @xcite .",
