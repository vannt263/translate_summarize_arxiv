    "considering the similarity of the power supplied by a supernova explosion ( sne ) , which is @xmath4 , and the power required to maintain the cosmic - ray ( cr ) energy density in the galaxy ( @xmath5 ) , it is widely beleived that the majority of crs in the galaxy are accelerated in supernova remnant ( snr ) shock waves .",
    "if this is true , then it is very important to know the maximum energy of crs that can be accelerated in snrs as well as the fraction @xmath6 of sne energy that can be converted into crs by diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "studies based on the plane - wave approximation have shown that the maximum energy can be @xmath7,where z is the charge of the particle ( see e.g. lagage @xmath8 cesarsky 1983 ) .",
    "however , studies using nonlinear effects produced by accelerated crs have found that the maximum energy can be as large as @xmath9 ( berezhko 1996 ) . regarding the total energy transfered into crs in a sne , there can actually be a considerable variation in the value of @xmath6 among the sources , but",
    "its value is generally considered to be @xmath10 which can easily be up to @xmath11 ( berezhko et al . 1996 ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the crs observed at the earth is that they are highly isotropic .",
    "their anisotropy amplitude is only @xmath12 in the energy range of @xmath13 ( guillian et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) with the phase mainly found in the outer galaxy particularly in the second quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "the high degree of isotropy is because crs do not reach earth from the sources directly .",
    "they undergo difusion in the galaxy as a result of scattering either by magnetic field irregularities or by self - excited alfven and hydromagnetic waves before reaching the earth . in the present study , because crs are composed mainly of protons below the knee region @xmath14 , the anisotropy below the knee is considered mainly because of the proton component .",
    "the anisotropy observed at the earth may be because of the effect of global diffusion leakage of crs from the galaxy , the effect of random nature of cr sources both in space and time , or the effect of the local sources ( see e.g. ptuskin et .",
    "al . 2005 ) .",
    "studies using local snrs lying within @xmath15 from us with ages less than @xmath16 have been carried out , assuming these to be instantaneous point sources ( dorman et al .",
    "it was concluded that the fact that the cr anisotropy is almost energy independent in the energy range of @xmath17 may be because we are observing the vela source s maximum anisotropy amplitude .    in a recent paper ,",
    "erlykin @xmath8 wolfendale ( 2006 ) have shown that the observed characteristics of crs , and in particular their anisotropy , are mainly the product of local sources located within a distance of @xmath18 from the sun .",
    "their study considers the actual positions of the observed snrs within @xmath19 from the sun as well as the position of the solar system at the inner edge of the orion arm .",
    "however , they could not incorporate the actual ages of the snrs in their study because their model considers the crs to be confined in the snrs for around @xmath20 , but the majority of observed snrs have ages less than @xmath21 .",
    "among the ten samples that they simulated , only one sample has been found to show the phase of the anisotropy which agrees with the observed data .",
    "considering local snrs located within a distance of @xmath15 and age less than @xmath22 , a study had also been carried out using the data on the high energy cr spectrum and anisotropy to constrain the value of cr diffusion coefficient in the galaxy and its dependence on the energy ( ptuskin et al .",
    "2005 ) , assuming the particles are released from the sources at the time of the explosion itself .",
    "ptuskin et al .",
    "have shown that the diffusion model with reacceleration is barely compatible with the observed cr anisotropy , with a discrepancy that is roughly within a factor of 3 .",
    "the plain diffusion model predicts a value of anisotropy that is too large .    from these earlier works",
    ", it can be seen that the cause of the observed amplitude and the phase of the cr anisotropy is not clearly understood , although local phenomena are more likely to play a dominant role . in the present study",
    "we also try to understand the problem , but with more emphasis given to the particle release time .",
    "we consider different possible forms of particle injection from the sources , such as like burst - like injection , continuous injection for a finite time , injection from a stationary source and energy dependent injection .",
    "we then study the observed local snrs and examine the effect of the different particle release times on the observed cr anisotropy . in short",
    ", the plan of the paper can be outlined as follows . in section 2",
    "we calculate the cr spectrum generated by a single point - like source . in section 3 we discuss the effect of different particle release times from the sources on the cr flux and anisotropy . in section 4",
    "we give an application to the nearby snrs located within @xmath23 from the earth .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present the results and discussions about the whole study .",
    "in the diffusion model , neglecting convection , energy losses and particle losses as a result of nuclear interactions , the propagation of cr protons in the galaxy is given by ( see e.g. gaisser 1990 and references therein ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the differential number density , @xmath26 is the proton kinetic energy , @xmath1 with @xmath27 constant ( positive ) is the diffusion coefficient which is assumed to be spatially uniform in the galaxy and @xmath28 is the proton production rate [ i.e. @xmath29 is the number of protons produced by the source in a volume element @xmath30 in the energy range @xmath31 in time @xmath32 .",

    "in other words , we can write @xmath41 and for a point source +   + @xmath42 + with this assumption the proton density at a distance @xmath38 from a point source can be calculated by introducing eqs .",

    "the proton source spectrum @xmath46 is taken as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the normalization constant and @xmath49 is the proton mass energy . the source spectral index @xmath50 is chosen such that @xmath51 , the observed proton spectral index ( haino et al .",

    "the actual form of @xmath52 is not known exactly .",
    "it can be a simple energy independent function or a complicated energy dependent function also ( i.e. particles with different energies emitted at different times ) .",
    "in fact , detailed studies have shown that the most energetic paricles start to escape from the source region at the very beginning of the sedov phase itself , although the major fraction of the crs remain confined for a period of about @xmath16 ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the present study",
    ", we will consider different possible forms of @xmath52 s corresponding to different types of particle injection , that is , burst - like injection , continuous injection for a finite time , injection from a stationary source and also the energy dependent injection mentioned above .",

    "@xmath62 represents the total observed flux of cr protons above @xmath63 ( haino et al .",

    "when the injection time of crs from the sources is significantly short , the injection process can be represented by a @xmath34-function as @xmath68 eq . ( 10 ) represents the burst - like injection of all the particles at time @xmath69 after the explosion . using this",

    "( 19)@xmath8(20 ) is the same as in the case of burst - like injection of particles discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "this implies that the total anisotropy parameter ( eq .",
    "9 ) varies as @xmath82 .    from the study",
    ", we can now see that for the continuous injection of particles it is important to know when the observation is being made for a particular source .",
    "if we observe the source after it is switched off , we see a spectrum much steeper than would have been observed during its active period . for the present study",
    ", we take @xmath118 because it is generally accepted that crs remain confined in the snrs upto around @xmath16 ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "so , for the nearby snrs which are listed in table 1 , it is expected that for the same source spectrum the geminga supernova will give a steeper spectrum at the earth compared to all the other remaining snrs , because it is the only source ( with an estimated age of @xmath119 ) that is being observed after it is switched off .",
    "another important point is that for a fixed value of @xmath86 , the total anisotropy parameter @xmath34 ( eq .",
    "9 ) varies with @xmath85 . in both cases discussed above ,",
    "this is given by @xmath120 for high energy particles .",
    "thus , the dependence of @xmath34 on injection time in the continuous particle injection model is weaker than that in the burst - like injection model .",
    "the particle spectrum for the case of injection of cr particles from a stationary source can be easily obtained using eq . ( 11 ) . for the burst - like injection of particles at time @xmath121 , eq . (",

    "the single source anisotropy amplitude in this case is @xmath130 and the total anisotropy ( eq .",
    "9 ) follows @xmath107 .",
    "studies based on diffusive shock acceleration in snrs have shown that the highest energy particles already start leaving the source region at the beginning of the sedov phase ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the major fraction of accelerated crs remain confined for almost around @xmath131 for an ism hydrogen atom density of @xmath132 .",
    "thus , an energy dependent proton confinement time in the source region ( proton release time from the source ) can be written as ( berezhko @xmath8 v@xmath133lk 2000 ) @xmath134yr\\ ] ] where @xmath135 , the maximum energy of accelerated particles , is taken as @xmath136 ( berezhko 1996 ) and @xmath137 marks the start of the sedov phase .",
    "for such a type of particle injection , the function @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) can be written as @xmath138 the particle spectrum and the anisotropy parameter for this case are the same as in the burst - like injection case with @xmath69 replaced by @xmath139 . from eq .",
    "( 24 ) , it can be seen that all the particles with energies less than @xmath140 remain confined until @xmath16 .",
    "so , except for particles with @xmath141 both the spectrum and the anisotropy are the same as those of the burst - like injection of particles at time @xmath142 .",

    "for @xmath188 the maximum cr source confinement time and @xmath195 , the lowest possible age of the _ undetected _ old snrs adopted in the present study , each point in the plot represents the maximum possible anisotropy amplitude at energy @xmath26 due to the old sources in the present model .",
    "calculations using other possible values of the source parameters ( i.e. @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) will give anisotropies that are less than the values shown in fig .",
    "3 . in fig .",
    "3 , the solid lines represent the model with @xmath163 and the dotted lines are for @xmath164 ; the upper lines represent the values calculated at @xmath198 and the lower lines at @xmath162 . the observed anisotropy data are also shown in order to see the extent of the contribution of the old sources .",
    "a detailed inspection of the figure shows that the contribution of the _ undetected _ old snrs to the cr anisotropy at the earth can not be fully neglected , particularly for the model with @xmath164 .",
    "this can be seen from the region bounded by the two dotted lines , which contains the data points below @xmath199 and above @xmath200 .",
    "however , here it should be mentioned again that each point given by the calculated lines only represents the maximum possible anisotropy due to the old sources .",
    "physically , it is highly unrealistic to get such a situation at any point of time , and thereby each line represents the values observed at the earth in the whole energy range .",
    "however , there is always a possibility of observing atleast one of the energy points at a given time .",
    "thus , we can not claim that the _ undetected _ old sources can fully explain the observed anisotropy data , but we can safely conclude that their contribution can not be completely neglected in the study of cr anisotropy at the earth .",
    "there also exists a model dependent argument , which supports the contribution of the old sources of the observed crs . for the generally excepted particle release time of @xmath188 ( which is also the value adopted here ) ,",
    "all the nearby known snrs listed in table 1 are quite young ( with estimated ages less than @xmath16 ) except for the geminga snr .",
    "thus , they have not yet released the crs into the local ism .",
    "so , it is quite possible that majority of the crs observed at the earth originate from nearby _ undetected _ old sources .",
    "in fact , the necessity for the presence of such old nearby sources has already been disccussed in the spectral study of both cr protons ( thoudam 2006 ) as well as cr electrons ( atoyan et al . 1995 ) .",
    "maximum cr anisotropy at the earth due to _ undetected _ old snrs with ages @xmath195 assuming burst - like injection of particles at @xmath188 .",
    "the calculations are done using eq . 8 and by taking the source distances @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the source distance which gives the maximum flux of crs of energy @xmath26 at the earth for a given @xmath191 and @xmath69 .",
    "each point represents the maximum possible anisotropy @xmath34 from an old source at a given energy @xmath26 ( see text for details ) .",
    "the solid lines are for @xmath163 and the dotted lines for @xmath164 in which the upper ones represent the values at @xmath198 and the lower ones at @xmath162 .",
    "data points are the same as in fig . 1 . and are shown just to see the extend of the old sources contribution.,scaledwidth=31.0% ]",
    "the analysis presented here involves the study of the effect of different particle release times from the sources on the cr spectrum and the anisotropy below @xmath201 observed at the earth .",
    "the study considers burst - like injection , continuous injection for a finite time , injection from a stationary source and energy dependent injection as possible forms of particle injection from the sources .",
    "the study shows that the case of particle injection from a stationary source is the same as that of the continuous injection for a finite time period for which @xmath95 ( see case 1 of section 3.2 ) . also , for the proton energy range of @xmath202 considered here",
    ", the energy dependent particle injection model can be represented by the burst - like injection of particles at time @xmath188 except for particles with energies @xmath203 .",
    "when applied to the nearby known snrs located within a distance of @xmath23 , it is found that the model with continuous injection of particles gives an anisotropy that is too large to explain the observed data at @xmath164 , but it predicts a value that is within a factor of 2 for @xmath204 at @xmath163 and @xmath174 .",
    "however , the burst - like injection model with @xmath163 can explain the data more closely at almost two values of particle injection time : @xmath205 , where the anisotropy is determined by monogem for @xmath179 and by the source g114.3 + 0.3 for @xmath180 and @xmath177 , where monogem dominates in the whole energy range below @xmath0 .",
    "also , the burst - like model with @xmath164 explains the data effectively above @xmath184 if particle injection takes place at @xmath206 , although below @xmath184 it predicts an anisotropy that is larger than the observed value by a factor of almost 4 . for this case",
    ", the total anisotropy is again determined mainly by the monogem snr .",
    "this result is strongly supported by the close agreement of the observed phase of the anisotropy with the positions of g114.3 + 0.3 and monogem in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , if the observed anisotropy is due to the effect of the local sources , the study favours the burst - like particle injection model both at @xmath163 and @xmath172 .",
    "the study further shows that the contribution of the _ undetected _ old snrs can not be fully neglected in the study of cr anisotropy at the earth . because of their unknown source parameters ( such as their ages and distances ) it is impossible to calculate their actual contribution to the observed crs .",
    "however , we can always try to make an estimate of their contribution by considering a proper model dependent set of source parameters . in the present study ,",
    "using source ages of @xmath195 and particle release time of @xmath188 , it has been shown that for the model with @xmath164 they can contribute significantly to the local crs .",
    "calculations using other possible values of the source parameters ( i.e. @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) will give anisotropies that are less than the values obtained here .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "3 shows only the maximum possible anisotropy value at energy @xmath26 due to the old sources in the present model .",
    "the study concludes that the contribution of the _ undetected _ old snrs to the observed cr anisotropy can not be simply ignored and should be considered in the study of local crs .",
