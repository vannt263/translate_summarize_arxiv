    "oxygen and nitrogen are key elements in the study of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the n / o  o / h ( or n / h  o / h ) diagram has been considered by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a prominent feature of this diagram is that , in its high - metallicity part ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath3 8.3 ) , the n / h abundance ratio shows a large scatter at a fixed value of the o / h abundance ratio @xcite .",
    "the n / h value for a given o / h contains important information about the heavy element enrichment history of a galaxy , and consequently , about its star formation history .",
    "therefore , an explanation of the origin of the scatter in the n / h  o / h diagram is key to understanding the evolution of galaxies .",
    "two main explanations are presently considered to account for the scatter in normal spiral galaxies : 1 ) the time delay between nitrogen and oxygen enrichment ; and 2 ) the local enrichment in nitrogen by wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "concerning the first explanation , @xcite have noted that , due the fact that o and n are produced in stars of different masses , there can be a significant time delay between the release of o , produced in high - mass stars , and that of n , produced in intermediate - mass stars , into the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    ". the n / o ratio of a galaxy then becomes an indicator of the time that has elapsed since the last episode of star formation .",
    "current stellar evolution models predict that n is mainly manufactured and ejected into the ism by intermediate - mass stars with masses greater than 3 - 4@xmath1 @xcite , although massive stars can contribute , at least at low metallicities @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the time delay between n and o enrichment in galaxies is 250  400 myr , depending on the adopted stellar mass  lifetime relation @xcite .",
    "properties of the observed n / o  o / h diagram can generally be reproduced by chemical evolution models of galaxies by taking into account a time delay @xcite .",
    "the exact value of the time delay is however still a subject of debate @xcite .",
    "concerning the second explanation , it is known ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) that some galaxies with wr features have a high n / o ratio .",
    "this suggests that the ejecta of wr stars may locally enrich the ism in n. @xcite noted that most points in the n / o  o / h diagram cluster at relatively low n / o values .",
    "this led them to conclude that the lower envelope is the `` equilibrium '' unperturbed locus and that the observed scatter is the result of intermittent increases in n , caused by the local contamination by wr stars or luminous blue variables .",
    "@xcite also arrived at the same conclusion .",
    "selective heavy element loss through enriched galactic winds may also introduce scatter in the n / o ratios .",
    "it is believed , however , that galactic winds play an important role in the chemical evolution of only dwarf galaxies , not of giant spirals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in recent years",
    ", the number of good - quality spectra of emission - line galaxies has increased dramatically due to the completion of several large spectral surveys , and in particular of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility of using the sdss spectral base to study the evolution of o and n abundances in galaxies in the redshift range z @xmath4 0.4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a previous study @xcite , we have considered the evolution of o and n abundances in galaxies with different stellar masses .",
    "we have found clear evidence for galaxy downsizing , where the sites of active star formation and hence of metal enrichment shift from high - mass galaxies at early cosmic times to lower - mass systems at later epochs @xcite .",
    "all enrichment ceases in the most massive galaxies at late cosmic times .",
    "this downsizing effect provides a remarkable opportunity for clarifying the origin of the scatter in the n / h  o / h diagram . indeed ,",
    "if the scatter is caused by a time delay between o and n enrichment in galaxies , then it should be minimized for the most massive galaxies where enrichment has stopped . on the other hand , one should expect that the n / h ratios of the less massive galaxies ( those with significant star formation at the current epoch ) to be shifted towards lower values relative to the massive galaxies in the n / h  o / h diagram , because there is a time delay between n and o enrichment and n has not yet been released in the ism .    we examine in this paper whether the time delay is in fact responsible for the large scatter in the n / h  o / h diagram .",
    "our previous study was based on the mpa / jhu catalogs of automatic line flux measurements of the sdss spectra ( see @xcite and other publications of those authors ) .",
    "the accuracy of such automatic line flux measurements seems is not good enough for investigating the origin of scatter in the n / h  o / h diagram .",
    "we have thus decided to manually measure the line fluxes of the sdss spectra .",
    "this provides us with more accurate line flux measurements , especially for spectra of objects with the largest redshifts , those with redshifts between 0.3 and 0.4 .",
    "we first extract from the mpa / jhu catalogs four subsamples of emission - line galaxies , each covering a different interval of galaxy stellar mass , centered respectively on the mass values @xmath5",
    "= 10@xmath0@xmath1 , 10@xmath6@xmath1 , 10@xmath7@xmath1 , and 10@xmath2@xmath1 . to have a reasonable number of galaxies in each subsample and in order for the galaxies to cover the whole redshift range in a roughly uniform fashion , the mass interval @xmath8 was chosen to be small and to vary from 0.0015 to 0.10 dex , depending on the redshift and @xmath5 . for each mass interval",
    ", we have extracted from the mpa / jhu catalogs emission - line galaxies with automatic measurements of fluxes in the h@xmath9 , h@xmath10 , [ oii]@xmath113727,3729 , [ oiii]@xmath125007 , [ nii]@xmath126584 emission lines .",
    "we impose the additional restrictions that the galaxies have equivalent widths @xmath13(h@xmath9 ) @xmath14 10  ( this criterion applies only to galaxies with redshifts @xmath15 0.3 , as we did not wish to reduce further the very small number of galaxies with @xmath16 @xmath14 0.3 ) , @xmath13([oii]@xmath113727,3729 ) @xmath14 3  , @xmath13([oiii]@xmath125007 ) @xmath14 3  , and @xmath13([nii]@xmath126584 ) @xmath14 2  .",
    "these additional restrictions insure that the chosen galaxies have a reasonably high star formation rate , giving rise to reasonably strong emission lines that can be measured with good accuracy .",
    "each so chosen spectrum was then examined visually and the noisy spectra were rejected .",
    "the line fluxes of the remaining galaxies were then measured with iraf .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath125007)/h@xmath9 vs [ nii]@xmath126584)/h@xmath10 diagram was then used to reject agns @xcite , with the dividing line between hii regions ionized by star clusters and agns taken from @xcite .",
    "the wavelength range of the sdss spectra is 3800  ",
    "9300  , so that for nearby galaxies with redshift z @xmath4 0.023 , the [ oii]@xmath123727+@xmath123729 emission line is out of the observed range .",
    "thus , all galaxies in our total sample have redshifts greater than @xmath17 0.023 . for distant galaxies with redshift z @xmath3 0.33 , the [ sii]@xmath12@xmath12 6717,6731 emission lines are out of the observed range .",
    "the sulfur line intensities are usually used as indicators of the electron density .",
    "they serve also to distinguish between hot and warm hii regions , in the framework of the on calibrations of @xcite .",
    "since the sulfur lines are not present , we will assume the electron density to be equal to 100 @xmath18 and that our sample does not contain hot hii regions ( i.e. those with 12+log(o / h ) @xmath4 8.0 ) .",
    "the redshift @xmath16 and stellar mass @xmath5 of each galaxy were taken from the mpa / jhu catalogs .",
    "when the stellar mass of a galaxy with redshift @xmath16 @xmath14 0.3 is not available in the mpa / jhu catalogs , we estimated it from its absolute magnitude @xmath19 , its colour @xmath20@xmath21 and its h@xmath9 equivalent width , using the relation @xmath22 where the galaxy stellar mass @xmath5 is in units of solar masses .",
    "this relation was derived by fitting the data for galaxies in the redshift interval 0.3 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath15 0.4 with available stellar masses in the mpa / jhu catalogs .",
    "we caution that this relation is not a general relation for the determination of galaxy stellar masses .",
    "it applies only within the small particular redshift interval defined above .",
    "we stress also that the derived masses serve only to select galaxies with various masses to populate our different subsamples and are not used in any calculation .",
    "our final database consists of 221 spectra of galaxies with @xmath5 = 10@xmath0@xmath1 ( with 74 objects with @xmath5 derived from eq .",
    "1 ) , 259 spectra of galaxies with @xmath5 = 10@xmath6@xmath1 ( 60 objects with @xmath5 from eq .",
    "1 ) , 244 spectra of galaxies with @xmath5 = 10@xmath7@xmath1 ( 32 objects with @xmath5 from eq .",
    "1 ) , and 152 spectra of galaxies with @xmath5 = 10@xmath2@xmath1 ( 7 objects with @xmath5 from eq .",
    "the measured emission - line fluxes are then corrected for interstellar reddening using the theoretical h@xmath10 to h@xmath9 ratio , in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "o and n abundances are then estimated for each galaxy , using the recent on calibrations of @xcite .",
    "these calibrations give both o and n abundances over the whole metallicity range with a satisfactory precision .",
    "@xcite found that the mean differences between o abundances determined from these calibrations and from the direct @xmath23 method based on the [ oiii]@xmath124363 line is only @xmath170.075 dex for o abundances , and only @xmath170.05 dex for n abundances .",
    "we first check the accuracy of our abundance determinations .",
    "fig.[figure : ohnhte ] shows the n / h  o / h diagram .",
    "the gray points represent galaxies in our four sdss subsamples with o and n abundances derived from the on calibrations .",
    "the dark triangles show hii regions in nearby galaxies @xcite , with o and n abundances derived with the @xmath23 method , commonly thought to be the most accurate one .",
    "it is seen that the galaxies in our sdss subsamples occupy the same region in the n / h  o / h diagram as the hii regions in nearby galaxies with o and n abundances derived through the @xmath23 method .",
    "this confirms that our on - calibration - based o and n abundances are quite reliable .",
    "the remarkable feature to note in the n / h  o / h diagram is the large scatter in n / h values at a given o / h value .",
    "this holds as much for sdss objects as for hii regions in nearby galaxies .",
    "we next investigate the redshift evolution of o abundances in each of the four galaxy mass ranges ( fig.[figure : zoh ] ) . in each panel labeled by the galaxies masses ,",
    "the filled gray circles show individual galaxies .",
    "the solid line is the best least - squares fit to those data .",
    "inspection of the upper panel shows that there is no systematic variation with redshift of the o abundance in galaxies with masses @xmath17 10@xmath0m@xmath24 up to @xmath16 = 0.4 .",
    "this implies that these galaxies have reached a high astration level some 4 gyr ago , and have been somewhat `` lazy '' in their evolution afterwards .",
    "the average value of the o abundances for galaxies with stellar mass m@xmath25 = 10@xmath0m@xmath24 is remarkably close to the o abundance in the orion nebula ( 12+log(o / h ) = 8.51 ) obtained by @xcite .",
    "it is also in good agreement with the o abundances in nearby luminous galaxies obtained by @xcite , using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "comparison between the different panels of fig.[figure : zoh ] shows clearly the effect of galaxy downsizing .",
    "massive galaxies do not show o enrichment : they already reach a relatively high o abundance at @xmath16 = 0.4 , and that abundance remains nearly constant until @xmath16 = 0 .",
    "the less massive galaxies do show o enrichment : they have lower o abundances at @xmath16 = 0.4 , but these increase from @xmath16 = 0.4 to @xmath16 = 0 , and at the present epoch , they are nearly the same as in massive galaxies .",
    "we next investigate the origin of the scatter in the n / h  o / h diagram .",
    "the upper left panel of fig.[figure : ohnh ] shows that diagram for the subsample that contains our most massive galaxies , those with masses @xmath17 10@xmath0m@xmath24 .",
    "it is seen that the scatter in the n / h  o / h diagram for this subsample of galaxies is small , especially for galaxies with @xmath16 @xmath4 0.3 ( see fig . 4 , to be discussed later ) .",
    "using this subsample , we have derived the following relation between n / h and o / h abundances @xmath26 this relation has been derived in an iterative manner .",
    "first , a least - squares fit was obtained for all data points with @xmath16 @xmath15 0.3 .",
    "then , objects with deviations larger than 2@xmath27 were rejected and a new least - squares fit derived .",
    "the final fit is obtained when , after several iterations , the fits for two consecutive ones coincide .",
    "the scatter in the n / h values relative to the final fit is @xmath27 = 0.037 dex .",
    "the derived n / h  o / h relation is shown in the upper left panel of fig.[figure : ohnh ] by a solid line , while the dashed lines show @xmath282@xmath27 shifts from that relation . it should be noted that this n / h  o / h relation is derived for a relatively small range of o / h and , consequently , its slope can not be determined with a high precision .",
    "therefore , it should not be used for o / h values beyond the above specified range . to establish a more general n / h  o / h relation , a sample of objects covering a more extended range in o / h would be needed .",
    "the above relation links n / h and o / h in galaxies where o and n enrichment has already ceased .",
    "one would expect that galaxies with significant star formation in the near past would be displaced towards lower n / h values in the n / h  o / h diagram relative to this relation , because of the time delay between n and o enrichment .",
    "comparison between the four panels of fig.[figure : ohnh ] clearly shows this effect .",
    "the most massive galaxies define an upper envelope in the n / h  o / h diagram and they do not show significant star formation in the last 4 gyr ( fig.[figure : zoh ] ) .",
    "the lower - mass galaxies are shifted towards lower n / h values and they show significant star formation during the same period ( fig.[figure : zoh ] ) .",
    "this is solid evidence that the differences in n / h for galaxies with a given o / h are caused by the time delay between n and o enrichment .",
    "fig.[figure : zdn ] shows how the deviations of the n abundance from the n / h  o / h relation ( equation 2 ) vary with mass and redshift .",
    "the gray points represent individual galaxies .",
    "the dashed lines show @xmath282@xmath27 deviations from that relation .",
    "the n evolution with redshift in galaxies of different masses is a clearly due to a galaxy downsizing effect . as the universe ages , the sites of star formation shift from high - mass galaxies ( log m = 11.3 ) , where star formation and o and n enrichment have ceased more than 4 gyr ago , to lower - mass galaxies ( log m @xmath15 11.3 ) where active star formation and o and n enrichment are still ongoing .",
    "comparison of figs.[figure : zdn ] and [ figure : zoh ] shows that the downsizing effect is more prominent for n than for o. this is because n is a secondary element while o is a primary one .",
    "to have comparable numbers of galaxies with low redshifts ( 0.02 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath15 0.15 ) in the highest - mass subsample of galaxies ( @xmath5 = 10@xmath0@xmath1 ) and in the lowest - mass subsample ( @xmath5 = 10@xmath2@xmath1 ) , we had to use a mass interval @xmath8 = 0.10 in the first case , and a value about 66 times lower , @xmath8 = 0.0015 , in the second case .",
    "this implies that , at the current epoch , star formation events occur nearly two orders of magnitude more often in low - mass galaxies than in high - mass ones .",
    "because of the time delay between o and n enrichment , there is a downward shift towards lower n / h values for low - mass galaxies in the n / h  o / h diagram ( fig.[figure : zdn ] ) .",
    "this naturally explains the finding of @xcite that most of the local dwarf star - forming galaxies cluster at relatively low",
    "n / o values in the n / o  o / h diagram .",
    "the o and n abundance evolutions with redshift in emission - line galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are investigated . to investigate the galaxy downsizing effect , we have measured line fluxes of selected galaxies in four intervals of galaxy stellar masses , ranging from 10@xmath0 @xmath1 to 10@xmath2 @xmath1 .",
    "the o and n abundances have been derived using the recent accurate calibrations of @xcite .",
    "we have found that the o and n abundance evolutions with redshift of the galaxies in our sample clearly show the galaxy downsizing effect @xcite , where enrichment ( and hence star formation ) is shifted from high - mass galaxies at earlier cosmic times to lower - mass galaxies at later epochs .",
    "we have examined the origin of the scatter in the n / h  o / h diagram .",
    "we have found that the most massive galaxies where o and n enrichment and star formation has already stopped , occupy a narrow band in the n / h  o / h diagram , defining an upper envelope . on the other hand ,",
