    "the standard model ( sm ) had been tested in many experiments at lep , slc and tevatron with a high accuracy .",
    "in particular , the yield of lepton pairs produced mainly via drell - yan processes , i.e. quark - antiquark annihilation by exchange of photons or z bosons , is predicted by the sm with a per mille precision .",
    "so far , the experimental data have shown no significant deviations from sm predictions for the drell - yan continuum up to tev - energy - scale .",
    "the high - order calculations of lepton pair production cross section in the mass region of @xmath0 tev/@xmath1 are in good agreement with lep and d0 data @xcite . at present , however , there are many theoretical attempts to extend the bounds of the sm in order to reach unification of strong and electroweak interactions or remove an arbitrariness in values of coupling constants in some other way and also to pull through known disadvantages of sm like the mass hierarchy problem , cp - violation problem etc .",
    "supersymmetry is the most popular theoretical extension of the sm , however , some other alternatives also exist . between them",
    "one can consider extended gauge models ( what contain extended sector of gauge bosons in comparison with the sm ) .",
    "consideration of symmetry groups wider than in the sm and appearance of extra gauge bosons is common feature of various left - right symmetric models , all variants of grand unification theories and models of composite gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "for all of these cases new vector bosons , neutral @xmath2 and charged @xmath3 , would appear at the mass scale of order of one tev/@xmath4 what can be observed at the lhc . another alternative way to go beyond",
    "the sm can be to consider so - called tev - scale gravity models , as given by brane world scenarios with large or compact extra spatial dimensions ( led ) @xcite .",
    "these models give in particular a set of new particle - massive kaluza - klein modes of graviton what can interact with the usual matter and contribute to the sm processes causing some new interesting physics at the tev energy scale ( for more details and a phenomenology review see , for example @xcite ) .    in our consideration",
    "we touch on only one of the possible led scenarios , the randall - sundrum ( rs1 ) approach @xcite .",
    "the standard setup for this approach contains two three - branes embedded into the external curve five - dimensional space , one brane is with negative tension ( our world with all usual sm fields ) and another one is with positive tension ( planckian brane ) what is needed to reproduce the sm mass hierarchy .",
    "the usual assumption is that all the sm fields and fields from the planckian sector are confined on corresponding branes and effectively four - dimensional .",
    "graviton is only really multidimensional field what can travel freely through the whole space ( the bulk space ) . because of nonzero curvature of the bulk space",
    "( what is represented by a slice of the five - dimensional ads space bounded by two branes ) and the specific space - time geometry new very interesting physics can be realized at our brane . in particular",
    ", in any model with compact extra spatial dimensions each matter field will have an infinite tower of massive excitations called kaluza - klein modes ( four - dimensional `` projections '' of multidimensional fields from our point of view ) .",
    "these modes can be visible at energy above the fundamental theory scale , say , from energies above one or a few tev .",
    "then our usual massless four - dimensional graviton can be treated as the zero mode from the kk - tower .",
    "but the distinctive feature of particular rs1 phenomenology is that excited massive graviton states are strongly coupled to ordinary particles ( not suppressed below the planckian scale like for ordinary graviton in usual description of gravity ) and can contribute significantly to the sm processes above the fundamental scale .",
    "mass splitting between kk - modes of graviton is of order @xmath5 @xcite , and values of masses start from the tev scale .",
    "so , at least the first kaluza - klein mode ( called rs1 graviton below ) can in principle be observed at the lhc as individual heavy ( quite narrow or not ) resonance .    at this point",
    "it is interesting to note that there exist also some realizations of tev - scale gravity models where fields other than graviton can have kaluza - klein modes , see for example a number of papers @xcite . in the papers",
    "interesting scenarios based on superstring theory were proposed in which all gauge bosons and higgses as far as their superpartners had kk - excitations .",
    "we will not touch on such scenarios in our further discussion but we would stress that study of phenomenological consequences of the existence of kk - modes of @xmath6 or photon can be done exactly in the same spirit as it is presented in subsections 2.1  2.2 below for @xmath2 including an asymmetry analysis .    for both of the conceptions considered , @xmath2 and rs1 graviton , a width of predicted resonances is not fixed but it can vary widely depending on the model parameters .",
    "it implies that these states can appear as individual resonances or can affect the high-@xmath7 lepton pair continuum leading to an excess of drell - yan production .",
    "thus , the distinctive experimental signature for these processes is a pair of well - isolated high-@xmath7 leptons with opposite charges coming from the same vertex .",
    "such the measurements can be performed at the both of lhc experiments , atlas and cms , which are expected to be able to trigger and identify hard muons with a transverse momentum up to several tev .",
    "the ability of the lhc experiments to detect rs1 graviton in the dielectron mode was investigated as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present the analysis of the lhc discovery limit on @xmath2 and rs1 gravitons in dimuon mode in assumption of the cms acceptance .",
    "the signal simulation is done for the parton subprocess @xmath8 in the leading order of qcd without higher order corrections . to generate @xmath2 boson and its decay to a muon pair as well as",
    "the relevant background events , the pythia 6.217 package @xcite with the cteq5l parton distribution function was used .",
    "there exist a number of possible non standard model scenarios which predict appearance of heavy neutral @xmath2 and/or charged @xmath3 gauge bosons ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "but only following @xmath2 models were used in our analysis :    1 .",
    "the left - right model ( lr ) @xcite based on the electroweak gauge group symmetry @xmath9 with an additional left - right symmetry ( here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the baryon and lepton numbers ) with default pythia couplings which are the same for both left- and right - handed type of fermions and are set to the same values as in the sm , @xmath12 = @xmath13 = 0.64 .",
    "the number of extra fermion generations is equal to three . 2 .",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 - models which naturally arise as a result of sequential breaking of so(10 ) or @xmath17 symmetry group in grand unified theories ( gut ) @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "the linear combination of the hypercharges under the two groups @xmath20 gives the charge of the lightest @xmath2 at the symmetry - breaking energies @xmath2 = @xmath21 .",
    "numerical values of the couplings for these models are taken from ref .",
    "3 .   for monte",
    "carlo studies the sequential standard model ( ssm ) @xcite was also used in which heavy bosons ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are assumed to couple only to one fermion type ( left ) with the same parameters ( couplings and total widths ) as for ordinary @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the standard model .",
    "the non - reducible background considered is the sm drell - yan process @xmath24 which gives nearly 95 @xmath25 of the standard model muon continuum .",
    "contributions from other reaction ( vector boson pair production @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , quark - antiquark production @xmath29 etc ) are very small and neglected in this study . in the sm",
    "the expected number of dimuon events is not very large and the @xmath2 resonance peak exceeds the background by above a factor ten ( fig .  [ fig1 ] , the left plot ) .",
    "the mass dependence of @xmath2 production cross secrion times on dimuon branching are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( the right plot ) . for comparison",
    "the cross section for standard drell - yan muon pair production as a function of their invarinat masses is also presented on the same figure .",
    "event samples for seven mass values were generated with above - mentioned model parameters .",
    "to take into account the detector response the parametrization of a muon momentum ( @xmath30 ) resolution , 4@xmath25/@xmath31 @xcite , was used .",
    "the dimuon is accepted when both decay muons are within detector system covering the pseudorapidity region of @xmath32@xmath33@xmath32 @xmath34 2.4 .",
    "in addition , the cut @xmath35 gev / c was applied on each muon .",
    "no cuts were made on isolation of muons in the tracker and the calorimeter .",
    "the total efficiency dimuon selection , @xmath36 , is about @xmath37 @xmath25 .    to estimate the @xmath2 discovery limit expected significance of the signal , @xmath38=@xmath39-@xmath40 ,",
    "was computed , where @xmath41 is the number of signal events passed through all kinematics cuts and @xmath10 is the number of background events .",
    "the discovery limits for a five @xmath42 signal are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "detection of the @xmath2 peak itself and precise measurement of its mass and width does not allow an underlying theoretical model describing the @xmath2 to be identified . to test a helicity structure of the boson and",
    "discriminate between a number of @xmath2 models , a leptonic forward - backward asymmetry can be used ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the asymmetry is defined as the ratio @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath10 are the numbers of events in the forward and backward directions , respectively .",
    "forward ( backward ) is defined as the hemisphere with @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , where @xmath47 is an angle between the outgoing negative lepton and the quark @xmath48 in the @xmath49 rest frame .",
    "such a definition assumes that the original quark direction is known , but this is not the case for the pp - experiment . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it was shown that it is possible to identify the quark direction with the boost direction of the dimuon system with respect to the beam axis .",
    "one of the features of the asymmetry , @xmath50 , is the distinctive rapidity - dependence for different @xmath2 models .",
    "such a dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the @xmath51 ( the left picture ) and the @xmath52 ( the right picture ) under assumption of a mass @xmath53 = 2.0 tev/@xmath4 , for 100 @xmath54 of an integrated luminosity .",
    "logic of such an analysis looks quite consequent but it is not complete in general as another one possibility is not accounted by it . as it was yet pointed out ( see comments on the theme in introduction above ) one can image a situation when we will see a resonance at collider with a mass about tev and quantum numbers of gauge boson what can be in principle not @xmath2 from the extended gauge sector but kaluza - klein excitation @xmath55 coming from models with extra spatial dimensions . the only way to distinguish these quite different cases when will be to look for other kk - excitations of other gauge bosons ( photon , gluon ) what must exist in the presence of extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned above the rs1 model predicts massive kk - modes of graviton ( @xmath56 a few tev ) which can been observed in experiments as heavy narrow resonance states ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is necessary to note here that an effect from kk - gravitons can also been extracted from changing of higgs boson rates because of mixing of them with radion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite )    the ability to test experimentally rs1 scenario predictions depends on the model parameter @xmath57 which controls coupling of graviton to the ordinary particles and a width of the resonance @xmath58@xmath59@xmath60 ; where the constant @xmath61 is determined by the number of open decay channels .",
    "results of the combined analysis in the rs1 scenario @xcite show that a value of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath62 and a corresponding value of graviton mass is restricted due to the experimental tevatron data and theoretical constraints to assure the model hierarchy ( @xmath63 @xmath64 10 tev ) .",
    "these limitations lead , in particular , to the conclusion that the constant @xmath62 can not be less than 0.027 , for the graviton mass of one tev/@xmath4 , and less than 0.1 , for the mass of 3.7 tev/@xmath4 .",
    "we operated in our consideration the range for coupling constant @xmath65 .",
    "graviton resonances can be produced via quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath66 as well as gluon - gluon fusion @xmath67 .",
    "the first of these processes is identical to the standard model s - channel exchange by an intermediate @xmath68 or @xmath69 vector boson , while the second one has no sm analogue .",
    "other partonic sub - processes are also possible , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which form real graviton production via the @xmath73-channel exchange ( graviton emission ) . to simulate both real and virtual graviton production in the proton - proton collisions at 14 tev center - of - mass energy , pythia 6.217",
    "was used in which the rs1 scenario was implemented with cteq5l parton distribution functions .",
    "the graviton production cross section for all five possible diagrams is presented in table  [ rs1_crs ] . here , two extreme possibilities for model parameter @xmath62 were considered .",
    "the first one was the most optimistic scenario when @xmath62 is equal to 0.1 .",
    "the second number in each row ( in brackets ) corresponds to the most difficult for experimental observation case when the coupling value @xmath62 = 0.01 . the majority ( at least 50@xmath7460 @xmath25 depending on a mass ) of gravitons was produced in the process of gluon - gluon fusion with real graviton emission , whereas virtual graviton production added only up to 15 @xmath25 of the total cross - section .",
    "the standard model background for this channel was the same as for the @xmath2 case .",
    ".[rs1_crs ] leading - order cross section of @xmath75 production in fb .",
    "the cteq5l parton distributions have been used . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      simulation of the detector response for graviton decay into muon pair is similar to the @xmath2 case . to estimate the discovery limit for",
    "rs1 graviton excitations the same procedure as for the @xmath2 case was applied .",
    "the cross section of @xmath76 production and corresponding cross section limits to observe a five @xmath42 signal for various integrated luminosity cases are presented in fig .",
    "as shown in the figure , the lhc can test the rs1 scenario in the whole range of the model parameter @xmath62 up to the mass of 2.0 tev/@xmath4 even at the low luminosity of 10 @xmath54 . in the more favourable case with @xmath62 = 0.1 the accessible mass region",
    "is extended up to 3.7 tev/@xmath4 . with 100 @xmath54 of integrated luminosity",
    "the reach increases up to 2.6 tev/@xmath4 for @xmath62=0.01 and 4.8 tev/@xmath4 for @xmath62=0.1 .    the direct comparison of results on an allowed region for @xmath62 with the data of the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that the whole space of the rs1-model parameters is accessible at the luminosity of 100 @xmath54 , and rs1 graviton can be discovered with the five @xmath42 significance .",
    "these conclusions , however , are not definitive , since initial theoretical constraints are very arbitrary .    under the assumption that a new resonance state was observed at the lhc , nature of this object should be understood in further analysis ( in principle , the resonance can come from the extended gauge sector as well as from some version of extra dimension models ) .",
    "the major difference between @xmath2 and rs1 graviton should appear in the @xmath77 distribution ( where @xmath78 is the polar angle of muons in the center - of - mass system of the dimuon pair ) which is strongly spin dependent .",
    "course , these distributions will be distorted by acceptance cuts , especially in the region of large angles , and expected theoretical predictions will differ from experimental ones . nevertheless fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the distinct difference between the spin-1 ( @xmath2 ) and the spin-2 ( rs1 graviton ) curves obtained for muons after all cuts . to ease the comparison ,",

    "in this work we present the discovery potential of @xmath2 gauge bosons as well as rs1 gravitons in the muon channel at the lhc experiments .",
    "the estimated discovery limit for @xmath2 is about @xmath79 tev/@xmath4 depending on the couplings for 100 @xmath54 integrated luminosity . at the same luminosity",
    "the first kk - mode of rs1 graviton can be observed up to the mass values of 2.6 tev/@xmath1 and 4.8 tev/@xmath4 for @xmath62 = 0.01 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "the angular distribution of muons in the final state can be used to distinguish the spin-1 and the spin-2 resonance states , at least in the mass region up to 2.3 tev/@xmath4 .",
    "the different @xmath2 models can be distinguished ( up to the mass value of 2.5 tev/@xmath4 ) using the leptonic forward - backward asymmetry .",
