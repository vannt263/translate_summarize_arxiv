    "<S> in the light of @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , the structure of cosmic strings are obtained from the abelian higgs model , which is an effective description to the brane world cosmic string system . in this topological description of the cosmic string , combining the result of decomposition of u(1 ) gauge potential , we analytically reach the familiar conclusions that in the brane world scenario the magnetic flux of the cosmic string is quantized and the rr charge of it is screened .    </S>",
    "<S> the current wmap data has placed the inflationary cosmology on solid grounds.@xcite so the brane inflation@xcite has become an indispensable part of the brane world scenario . in a particularly simple </S>",
    "<S> version,@xcite brane inflation takes place when a d3-brane and an anti - d3-brane move slowly towards each other , and ends as the d3-brane pair annihilates . </S>",
    "<S> suppose a stack of d3-branes spans our universe , and the standard model fields are open modes on them . </S>",
    "<S> when one of them is anihilated at the end of the inflation , the d - strings as the cosmic strings will be produced inside ( or very close to ) the d3-branes . </S>",
    "<S> assuming all extra dimensions are compactified , the stability of such d - strings as d1-vortices inside the d3-branes was demonstrated.@xcite it is also pointed out in ref . that the simplest way to see the existence and stability of d1-vortices in d3-branes is to realize the direct connection between the d1-vortex solution and a certain limit of abelian higgs ( ah ) model . </S>",
    "<S> so the study of the ah model is very important to the description of the cosmic strings in the brane world scenario .    to construct the ah model , the complex scalar higgs field @xmath0 and u(1 ) gauge field @xmath1 inside the d3-brane </S>",
    "<S> are introduced . the phase of the higgs field @xmath0 is denoted by the axion @xmath2 , which is the dual of the rr 2-form field @xmath3 inside the d3-brane . </S>",
    "<S> the axion @xmath2 measures the winding number of the d1-vortex and the field @xmath3 measures the net rr charge of the d1-vortex . </S>",
    "<S> then the ah model lagrangian is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the ah model has vortex solution ( abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortex @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> using so - called @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , this vortex solution can be expressed in another way.@xcite and this kind of expression provides a new description of the cosmic string . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , according to the @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , the vortex ( or string ) configurations can always be produced from the zero points of the complex scalar field in the four - dimensional space - time . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the cosmic string structures originated from the zero points of the complex scalar quintessence field were discussed in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this description of the vortex configurations is the physical quantities concerning the topology of the system can be expressed in an analytical way , and the relationships of these quantities can be proved strictly . therefore , for the purpose of studying the topological property of the cosmic strings , this description is highly significant .    in the present work , using the @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , we obtain the cosmic string structures from the ah model , which is an effective description to the brane world cosmic string system . furthermore , combining the result of decomposition of u(1 ) gauge potential in ref . , we analytically reach the familiar conclusions that in the brane world scenario the magnetic flux of the cosmic string is quantized and the rr charge of it is screened.@xcite    to be self - contained basically , we will briefly review the @xmath0-mapping topological current theory in the following . consider a d - dimensional smooth manifold with metric tensor @xmath7 and local coordinates @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> define a map @xmath9 : @xmath10 and introduce the direction unit field of @xmath11 : @xmath12 then we can construct a topological tensor current : @xmath13 it is easy to see that @xmath14 is completely antisymmetric and identically conserved . define the jacobian tensor @xmath15 , and the @xmath0-space green function @xmath16 then using @xmath17 and the green function relation @xmath18 we can find @xmath19 which implies that @xmath20 only at the points where @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> generally , these points would correspond to the submanifolds where the topological defects are located . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote the @xmath22-th above - mentioned submanifold by @xmath23 , and define a corresponding normal submanifold @xmath24 which is spanned by the parameter @xmath25 @xmath26 with the metric tensor @xmath27 , we can get the only intersection point of @xmath23 and @xmath24 denoted by @xmath28 . by virtue of the implicit function theorem,@xcite at the regular points of @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , there exists the only solution to the equations @xmath21 , and we can expand eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmn01 ] ) as @xmath29 where the jacobian @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the @xmath32-function on the submanifold @xmath23 , and @xmath33 denotes the winding number of the @xmath22-th topological defect . </S>",
    "<S> some important physical quantities concerning the topology , say magnetic flux , can be calculated from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmn02 ] ) . according to the implicit function theorem,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the irregular points of @xmath11 correspond to the branch points of the topological current @xmath14 , and the branch processes of @xmath14 occur at these very points . </S>",
    "<S> these branch processes can describe various evolutions of the topological defects , and the total topological charge of the system will keep unchange during these evolutions since @xmath14 is a conserved current .    before entering into the concrete analysis of the ah model ( [ ah ] ) , there remains two more issues that are worth noting . </S>",
    "<S> first , our description of the cosmic string is different from the exact physical picture of it in a subtle way , since the starting action ( [ ah ] ) is different from the action used in ref . where a @xmath32-function source term for the rr field is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> when we discuss the topological property of the cosmic string , this difference can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> second , as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , our study to the cosmic string structure originate from the ah model ( [ ah ] ) , but the conclusions we obtain are not limited to it . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the rr charge of the cosmic string which we will discuss below is absent from the original ah model . </S>",
    "<S> actually , our discussions apply to the general situation provided by ref . .    when the spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place in the system described by the ah model lagrangian ( [ ah ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the gauge field @xmath1 swallows the axion @xmath2 , which serves as the goldstone boson , and gains mass @xmath34 besides , the higgs boson also gains mass @xmath35 the value of the ratio @xmath36 will decide the force between the vortices,@xcite so it is an important parameter in the study of the branch processes of the cosmic strings . </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath37   \\nonumber \\\\          & = & 2e^{2}a_{\\mu}\\phi^{*}\\phi - ie[\\phi^{*}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi )             -(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)^{*}\\phi ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{jmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , from ( [ ah ] ) , we have the equations of motion @xmath38 set @xmath39 , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we can find @xmath41 and separate ( [ m1 ] ) into two real equations @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . from above two equations , </S>",
    "<S> the current @xmath45 is found to be conserved : @xmath46 this result is consistent with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m2 ] ) .    using the @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , we can develop the cosmic strings structures from the higgs field @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> introduce the two - dimensional unit vector @xmath47 from @xmath48 : @xmath49 define the topological tensor current @xmath50 obviously , @xmath51 is anti - symmetric and identically conserved . </S>",
    "<S> similar to ref . , we can obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath0-space @xmath32-function , which satisfies the green function relation @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the jacobian tensor . </S>",
    "<S> assume the normal submanifolds of the world sheets of the cosmic strings are spanned by the parameter @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> then from the implicit function theorem,@xcite it follows that under the regular condition @xmath58 there exists the only solution to @xmath59 : @xmath60 which represents @xmath61 two - dimensional world sheets of the cosmic string with intrinsic coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> though we obtain above cosmic string structures from the higgs field @xmath0 , it is not hard to see that the same result can also be obtained from the more general complex scalar field with its vacuum manifold @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the present of the gauge field @xmath1 will provide the possibility of the finite energy for the unit length of the cosmic string .    </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath32-function theory,@xcite we can expand ( [ jmn2 ] ) in a way with more specific topological meaning@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath33 is the winding number of the @xmath22-th cosmic string , the jacobian @xmath66 is defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ reg ] ) , @xmath28 is the intersection point of the @xmath22-th worldsheet and its normal submanifold , @xmath67 denotes the @xmath32-function in the four - dimensional space - time , @xmath68 represents the world sheet of the @xmath22-th cosmic string , and @xmath69 is the invariant volume element of the world sheet . in light of the implicit function </S>",
    "<S> theorem,@xcite the spatial components of @xmath51 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the jacobian vector , @xmath72 represents the @xmath22-th cosmic string , @xmath73 is the line element of the @xmath74-direction , and @xmath75 is the line element along the cosmic string direction .    from ( [ jmu ] ) , we have @xmath76 \\nonumber \\\\           & = & -\\frac{1}{e}\\epsilon_{ab}n^{a}\\partial_{\\mu}n^{b }            + \\frac{1}{e}\\epsilon_{ab}n^{a}d_{\\mu}n^{b}. \\label{amu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the result of decomposition of the u(1 ) gauge potential,@xcite eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amu ] ) can be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a phase factor . </S>",
    "<S> so the corresponding field tensor is @xmath79 the magnetic field @xmath80 i.e. the mathematical form of the magnetic field is identical to that of the spatial component of @xmath51 defined in ( [ ji ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , using ( [ ji ] ) and ( [ bi ] ) , we can find the magnetic flux of the @xmath22th cosmic string is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the two - dimensional spatial surface perpendicular to @xmath72 . as showed in ( [ flu ] ) , once more , we obtain the familiar result that the magnetic flux of the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortex is quantized . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation which has the similar mathematical form can also be found in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that , during the course of this derivation , there is no need to assume the current @xmath45 vanishes and the inner structure of @xmath1 and @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) are evident .    from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmu ] ) , ( [ amu ] ) and ( [ amu2 ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath85 in terms of the rr 2-form field @xmath3 , we have@xcite @xmath86 for the cylindrical symmetry around a certain cosmic string , @xmath87 is only the function of the distance from the cosmic string . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath88 therefore , from eqs . ( </S>",
    "<S> [ flu ] ) and ( [ cmn2 ] ) , we can also draw the conclusion , which has been given in ref . , that the winding number contribution from @xmath0 cancels the magnetic flux contribution from @xmath1 so that the net rr charge of the cosmic string is zero . from the derivation of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cmn2 ] ) , we can see that the above conclusion is a topological property of the cosmic string , and independent of the detail of the system . </S>",
    "<S> so , when two cosmic strings get close enough to each other , and the cylindrical symmetry of the field distribution around a single cosmic string is broken , we could expect that the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cmn2 ] ) would not hold for a single cosmic string any more , but the total rr charge of the cosmic strings would still be zero globally for the topological reason .    in conclusion , by virtue of @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , the structure of cosmic strings has been obtained from the ah model , which provides an effective description to the brane world cosmic string system . as mentioned before , this description of the cosmic string is very similar to that of the vortex in the type - ii superconductor , the fact that the cosmic strings is originated from the zero points of the higgs field @xmath0 is manifested obviously . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from the exact physical picture of the cosmic string mentioned in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , that the cosmic strings should be thought as the points where the phase of the higgs field @xmath0 is not defined , even with @xmath89 there . in above - mentioned description , combining the result of decomposition of u(1 ) gauge potential , we have reached the familiar conclusions again as follows : i ) the magnetic flux of the cosmic string is quantized , ii ) the rr charge of the cosmic string is screened .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the approach used in this paper expresses the inner structures of the physical quantities analytically and has the highly topological meaning . using this approach </S>",
    "<S> it has been proved that when the regular condition ( [ reg ] ) is fail , the branch processes of the cosmic strings will occur , and in these processes the total winding number as the topological charge of the cosmic strings is conserved.@xcite we can expect that the generalized @xmath0-mapping topological current theory@xcite and the decomposition theory of the gauge potential beyond u(1)@xcite will play a more important role in the future study of the cosmic strings and other topological defects . </S>"
