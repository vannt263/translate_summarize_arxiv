    "the motion of celestial bodies has attracted people s interests from the ancient era .",
    "the ancient people used to obtain the important information on the seasons or the time from it .",
    "even now , the motion of celestial bodies is one of the important foundations of the modern science .",
    "the modern physics begins with the kepler s law , the newton s law and the law of universal gravitation .",
    "our understanding about the celestial motion was extended by the newton s theory .",
    "the interest in the celestial motion did not change even when einstein proposed the general relativity .",
    "indeed , one of the classical tests of the general relativity is the account for the anomalous perihelion shift of mercury @xcite . at present , the knowledge of the celestial motion is increasing its importance as the devices to probe our universe .",
    "for instance , the general relativity predicts the existence of gravitational waves , and many researchers in the world endeavor to catch them .",
    "one of the main targets in the detection of gravitational waves is a binary system which consists of celestial bodies like neutron stars or black holes .",
    "those researchers attempt to detect the gravitational waves generated by the orbital motion of the binary .",
    "therefore , it is still important to investigate the motion of extended bodies like celestial objects in the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "now , it is recognized that there are two flows in the studies on movement of an extended object in the general theory of relativity .",
    "one of them starts from the study of einstein , infeld and hoffmann @xcite .",
    "they regarded the existence of object as singular points of the gravitational field , and discuss the motion of objects in a weak field approximation .",
    "the advantage of their method is that it is unnecessary to treat the objects as test particles because einstein _ et.al .",
    "_ solved the field equations in an approximation .",
    "their study has led to the later development of the post newtonian theory .",
    "another flow regards the motion of objects as motion of a test particle on a background spacetime . in this standpoint ,",
    "papapetrou derived equations of motion for a spinning particle moving in a curved spacetime by considering the taylor expansion , that is , multipole expansion of the divergence of an energy - momentum tensor at the position of the particle @xcite .",
    "the equations derived by him are known as the papapetrou equations .",
    "the papapetrou s method was not covariant in integrating tensors , but dixon developed a covariant method by using the bitensor formulation @xcite .",
    "in addition , there exists another interesting way to derive the papapetrou equations .",
    "tulczyjew derived the papapetrou equations in a more simple and covariant way by using the dirac s delta function @xcite .",
    "more recently , anandan , dadhich and singh developed an approach with the action principle @xcite .",
    "they consider the taylor expansion of an action for a particle and derive equations of motion . in this article ,",
    "our standpoint is the one of latter flow .    now , there are two approaches to treat the multipole properties of objects",
    ". one of them is based on the distribution of the matter , and another one is based on the gravitational field created by the objects . in consideration on the motion of objects ,",
    "it is indeed intuitive to focus on the distribution of matter in deriving equations of motion as papapetrou and dixon did .",
    "however , when we discuss the motion in the gravitation field , it is more natural to be based on the field created by the object than to be based on the distribution of the matter .",
    "in addition , the treatment of multipoles in previous researches was not exactly based on @xmath0 , though the concept of multipole moments should be defined by a classification by the lie group @xmath0 .    in this article ,",
    "our purpose is to discuss the motion of objects on a curved spacetime based on the above viewpoint .",
    "our argument will be presented as follows . in the section [ sec : mp in sr ] , we classify solutions of the field equations and define multipole moments based on @xmath0 in the context of the special relativity .",
    "then , we recognize an object as a point singularity of the field and construct an energy - momentum tensor of the object . in section [ sec : mp in gr ] , then we turn to the general relativity and derive equations of motion from the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "then , when we examine up to dipole moment , we show that our equations can be equivalent to the papapetrou equations in adopting a certain definition of the center - of - mass .",
    "moreover , we propose more simple equations of motion for the spinning particle . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results .",
    "notations used in this article are the following .",
    "the signature of metrics is @xmath1 .",
    "we denote metrics of a minkowsky spacetime and a curved spacetime by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the roman indices run over 1 to 3 and the greek indices run over 0 to 3 .",
    "the definition of curvature is @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we use convenient symbols @xmath6 for simplicity of writing .",
    "we occasionally use the multi - index notation for capital roman indices ; in the expression @xmath7 , _ the upper - case letter",
    "_ `` @xmath8 '' indicates an ordered set of _ lower - case letter _",
    "`` @xmath9 '' _ indices _ , i.e. , `` @xmath9 '' is a mere number of the indeces .",
    "for example , @xmath10 .",
    "the signature of perfect asymmetry symbol @xmath11 s is defined by @xmath12 for 3-dimensional and @xmath13 for 4-dimensional .",
    "in this section , we formulate an energy - momentum tensor which is corresponding to a multipole particle in the inertial motion on the minkowsky spacetime . here",
    ", we suppose that the particle can be a source of gravitation but its motion receives no influence from the gravitational field .",
    "the interaction between the particle and the gravitational field will be introduced in the next section .",
    "it is well known that the einstein equation can be written in a klein - gordon type equation as following , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dalembertian by the lorenz metric @xmath16 , @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the landau - lifshitz s pseudo - tensor . moreover ,",
    "the de donder gauge condition @xmath20 is imposed on @xmath17 as a coordinate condition .",

    "simultaneously , we consider @xmath53 as unit vectors which span the hyper - surface .",

    "the spinning particle has angular momentum , and so we can obtain an energy - momentum tensor for it when we take @xmath129 in the equation ( [ eq : emt ] ) : @xmath130\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in this stage , we still leave the mass dipole moment @xmath131 not to be fixed . what is to do is to process ( [ eq : tofspinningparticle ] ) according to the algorithm in the last subsection . for the simplicity , we set    [ eq : mm1 ] @xmath132    moreover , we decompose @xmath133 and @xmath134 into the compositions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath56 as follows ,    @xmath135    where we define the following variables ,    [ eq : mm3 ] @xmath136      [ eq : eom0 ] @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142      \\left(\\frac12b^{\\rho\\nu\\mu}-u^{\\nu}b_1^{\\rho\\mu}\\right)=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : eom3}\\ ] ]    let us substitute ( [ eq : mm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mm3 ] ) for ( [ eq : eom0 ] ) .",
    "firstly , the equation ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) becomes an identity @xmath143 .",
    "secondly , the equation ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) turns into @xmath144 by multiplying @xmath145 to this , we obtain @xmath146 by multiplying @xmath147 to ( [ eq : ju ] ) and symmetrizing the indices @xmath124 and @xmath84 , we get @xmath148 and by antisymmetrizing , we obtain @xmath149}\\right)=0.\\ ] ] thirdly , the equation ( [ eq : eom3 ] ) with ( [ eq : ju0 ] ) changes to @xmath150 because the relation @xmath151 concludes @xmath152 we can reduce the equation ( [ eq : eom3 ] ) to @xmath153 summarizing the result , we obtain the equations ( [ eq : ju0 ] ) , ( [ eq : ppm ] ) , ( [ eq : asymjm ] ) and ( [ eq : myeom0 ] ) as the equation of motion .    now , we left the mass - dipole @xmath131 not to be fixed until here . by choosing a suitable definition of the center - of - mass , we can show that the equations are equivalent to the papapetrou equations ,    [ eq : papapetrou ] @xmath154 @xmath155    to do this , we redefine the mass monopole and spin - dipole as follows ,    @xmath156    @xmath157    it is obvious that ( [ eq : asymjm ] ) becomes to ( [ eq : papapetrou2 ] ) under the equation ( [ eq : sjrelation ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the replacement ( [ eq : mmrelation ] ) makes the contents in the first parenthesis of ( [ eq : myeom0 ] ) to @xmath158 now , notice the fact that we can set @xmath159 because of the freedom of @xmath131 .",
    "the mass - dipole @xmath131 is orthogonal to @xmath52 , so that , @xmath131 has three degrees of freedom . on the other hand , since the equation ( [ eq : pmsu ] ) is orthogonal to @xmath56 , ( [ eq : pmsu ] ) means three independent equations . to sum up",
    ", the equation ( [ eq : pmsu ] ) is a set of three ordinary differential equations for the three independent components of @xmath131 . according to the theorem on the existence of the solution of the ordinary differential equations",
    ", we can assure the existence of @xmath131 satisfying ( [ eq : pmsu ] ) .",
    "consequently , we have showed that the equation ( [ eq : myeom0 ] ) is equivalent to the papapetrou equation ( [ eq : papapetrou1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we can also show the energy - momentum tensor ( [ eq : tofspinningparticle ] ) is equal to the energy - momentum tensor given by tulczyjew @xcite , @xmath160 \\right\\},\\ ] ] under the replacement ( [ eq : sjrelation ] ) , ( [ eq : mmrelation ] ) and ( [ eq : pmsu ] ) .    in the above discussion , we set @xmath131 to satisfy ( [ eq : pmsu ] ) . however , this is not only a unique choice .",
    "rather , the equations become more simple by setting @xmath161 as well as the case of newton gravity . when we set @xmath131 in this way , we conclude the following equations    @xmath162    @xmath163    @xmath164    as the equation of motion of the spinning particle .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : myeom1 ] ) was known as the pole - dipole approximation of the equation of ( [ eq : papapetrou1 ] ) , but , it is no longer necessary to mention pole - dipole approximation .",
    "in this article , we constructed an energy - momentum tensor for a multipole particle , by considering a gravitational field created by the object .",
    "the multipole moments of the object were defined by those of the gravitational field , and they were elements of the irreducible representation space of @xmath0 . in this definition of the multipoles",
    ", there were two kind of arbitrariness .",
    "one of them is a slicing condition that decides a spatial hyper - surface , in which the multipoles are defined .",
    "another one is a dipole condition , that is concerned with the center - of - field and mean - position of the particle . by specifying the dipole in a certain manner",
    ", we obtained the papapetrou equations as the equations of motion .",
    "another specification led us to more simple representation of the equations of motion for the spinning particle .",
    "our equations allow us to understand the motion of the spinning particle in more simple way .",
    "the deviation from a geodesic can be given by only a coupling term of the spin of the particle and the curvature of background spacetime , and the spin evolves by parallel transportation along the world line of the particle .",
    "the simpler equations bring us the following advantages . in the case of the papapetrou equations , the 4-velocity of the particle is different from its linear momentum in general .",
    "therefore , some researchers have imposed the pole - dipole approximation on the equations of motion .",
    "this approximation is based on the assumption that quadratic terms of the spin have the same order of quadrupole moment .",
    "however , if we consider a peculiar case that an object has spin but no quadrupole moment , for example a spinning _ rigid body _ , the pole - dipole approximation is no longer valid . nevertheless , our equations are valid because the 4-velocity is parallel to the linear momentum in our equation .",
    "the author greatly thanks to y.kurita of kyoto university ( gshes ) for his help in obtaining references .",
    "let us focus on the following , @xmath165 note that @xmath166 and @xmath167 are not function of @xmath74 and they pass through the partial derivatives by @xmath74 .",
    "additionally , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are commutate each other , because @xmath109 is merely a parameter and has no relation to @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the first term of the equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) becomes @xmath170d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty }      \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left [          \\nabla_{\\alpha}\\cdots\\nabla_{\\beta }          \\left(a^{\\mu\\nu\\cdots}{\\cal d}\\right )      \\right]d\\tau,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we can proof the lemma [ lemma:1 ] .        secondly , let us consider a @xmath174-rank tensor @xmath175 .",
    "we can suppose that it is symmetry with the indices from @xmath176 to @xmath177 due to the assumption of the mathematical induction .",
    "notice the following equation , @xmath178 where we introduce a new notation for anti - symmetrization .",
    "the indices with an underline in ( [ eq : aaaaa ] ) means anti - symmetrization after symmetrization , for instance , @xmath179 . using this relation ( [ eq : aaaaa ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath180\\nabla_{\\mu_{k}}\\cdots\\nabla_{\\mu_2 }      + \\cdots+[\\nabla_{\\mu_{k+1}},\\nabla_{\\mu_k } ]      \\nabla_{\\mu_{k-1}}\\cdots\\nabla_{\\mu_1 }      \\right)n^{(\\mu_1\\cdots\\mu_k)\\mu_{k+1}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the terms in the parenthesis of the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : apth2 ] ) can be written into the form of the sum of @xmath181 .",
    "we can apply the assumption of the induction to these terms .",
    "therefore , we have proofed @xmath182    next , let us proof the orthogonality of @xmath173 and @xmath114 .",
    "define a projection operator @xmath138 .",
    "this is orthogonal to @xmath114 : @xmath183 .",
    "we can write an arbitrary tensor @xmath184 in the form @xmath185 .",
    "redefine @xmath173 by the tensor projected by @xmath137 instead of old @xmath173 , then we can assure of the orthogonality of new @xmath173 and @xmath114 .",
    "let us denote the two intersection points of the domain @xmath128 and the world line of the particle by @xmath186 and @xmath187 @xmath188 .",
    "at the end points @xmath186 and @xmath187 , we can choose the values of @xmath127 and its derivatives lower rank than @xmath189 to vanish for the sake of arbitrariness of @xmath127 .",
    "then , substituting ( [ eq : tulth2 - 2 ] ) for ( [ eq : tulth3 ] ) and integrating it by parts repeatedly , we obtain the following equation , @xmath190_{x = z(\\tau)}v^{\\mu_1\\cdots\\mu_k\\nu_1\\cdots\\nu_m}=0.\\ ] ] because the values of @xmath127 at @xmath186 and @xmath187 are fixed , we can not assume the behavior of @xmath127 along the world line of the particle .",
    "however , there is still freedom to fix the behaviors of @xmath127 in the direction perpendicular to the world line .",
    "therefore , we can set its spatial derivatives to vanish on the world line .",
    "in addition , we change the frame to the comoving frame of the particle .",
    "consequently , ( [ eq : aptul3 - 1 ] ) becomes @xmath191_{x = z(\\tau)}v^{i_1\\cdots i_n\\nu_1\\cdots\\nu_m}=0.\\ ] ] note that all the derivatives are only spatial ones because of @xmath192 , and also note that the indices @xmath193 to @xmath194 are fully symmetry because of commutability of the partial derivatives .",
    "now , there remains the arbitrariness of the value of @xmath195_{x = z(\\tau)}$ ] , so that , @xmath196 is concluded in order for ( [ eq : aptul3 - 2 ] ) to be valid .",
    "this means @xmath197 in general coordinates . repeating the same discussion ,",
    "it is concluded that all coefficients @xmath198 must be equal to @xmath199 .    3 c. m. will",
