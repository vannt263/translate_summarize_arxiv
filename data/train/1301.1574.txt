    "@xmath429 would exceed the upper bound , as explained in section [ turing ] , see also @xcite .",

    "we perform the integration by expanding the periodic contribution into a fourier series , integrate the individual fourier terms , and then sum up numerically .      concerning the statistical properties of the eigenvalues , we must emphasize that the conjectured properties depend on the choice of the surface @xmath433 .",
    "depending on whether the corresponding classical system of a point particle that moves freely on the surface is integrable or not , there are some generally accepted conjectures about the nearest neighbour spacing distributions of the eigenvalues in the limit @xmath62 .",

    "if the corresponding classical system is integrable , the eigenvalues behave like independent random variables and the distribution of the nearest neighbour spacings is in the limit @xmath62 close to a poisson distribution , i.e.  there is no level repulsion .",
    "if the corresponding classical system is chaotic , the eigenvalues are distributed like the eigenvalues of hermitian random matrices .",
    "the corresponding ensembles depend only on the symmetries of the system :    * for chaotic systems without time - reversal invariance the distribution of the eigenvalues approaches in the limit @xmath62 the distribution of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) which is characterised by a quadratic level repulsion . * for chaotic systems with time - reversal invariance and integer",
    "spin the distribution of the eigenvalues approaches in the limit @xmath62 the distribution of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) which is characterised by a linear level repulsion . * for chaotic systems with time - reversal invariance and half - integer spin the distribution of the eigenvalues approaches in the limit @xmath62 the distribution of the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) which is characterised by a quartic level repulsion .",
    "these conjectures are very well confirmed by numerical calculations , but several exceptions are known .",

    "<S> in this paper we study , both analytically and numerically , questions involving the distribution of eigenvalues of maass forms on the moonshine groups @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a square - free integer . after we prove that @xmath0 has one cusp , we compute the constant term of the associated non - holomorphic eisenstein series . </S>",
    "<S> we then derive an `` average '' weyl s law for the distribution of eigenvalues of maass forms , from which we prove the `` classical '' weyl s law as a special case . </S>",
    "<S> the groups corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the same signature ; however , our analysis shows that , asymptotically , there are infinitely more cusp forms for @xmath4 than for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we view this result as being consistent with the phillips - sarnak philosophy since we have shown , unconditionally , the existence of two groups which have different weyl s laws . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we employ hejhal s algorithm , together with recently developed refinements from @xcite , and numerically determine the first @xmath6 of @xmath4 and the first @xmath7 eigenvalues of @xmath5 . with this information </S>",
    "<S> , we empirically verify some conjectured distributional properties of the eigenvalues . </S>"
