    "this paper presents a new application of transition path sampling@xcite , namely to nucleation of bulk phase transitions@xcite .",
    "it should be of interest to those concerned with computational techniques devoted to rare transitions between metastable states , as well as to those interested in nucleation theory .",
    "the application focuses on the simplest example of nucleation , that of a supercooled ising model .",
    "we are not the first to carry out numerical simulations of nucleation in the ising model .",
    "for example , see @xcite .",
    "our work is distinguished from these earlier studies in that we focus on the statistics of an ensemble of reactive pathways to nucleation .",
    "we are also not the first to use transition path sampling to study nucleation of a bulk phase transition .",
    "zahn , for instance , has used this technique to study atomistic models undergoing solid - solid transitions@xcite . that work succeeded at harvesting typical nucleation pathways and examples of transition states for specific molecular systems .",
    "in contrast , our focus in this paper is on generic issues raised by recent experiments and simulations@xcite , issues that suggest the importance of deviations from classical nucleation theory due to fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of nucleation are thought to be governed by a competition between two effects in the growing nucleus  an unfavorable contribution from the formation of a surface and a favorable contribution from nucleating the stable phase : @xmath4 here , @xmath0 is the number of particles in the growing nucleus ( assumed to be spherical ) , @xmath5 is the chemical potential difference between the two phases and @xmath6 is the surface tension ( assumed to be that of an infinite planar interface ) .",
    "equation [ cnt ] assumes that the free energy of this non - equilibrium process depends on the size of the growing nucleus as the one relevant variable ( i.e. reaction coordinate ) that controls its progress : small nuclei tend to shrink due to their large surface area - to - volume ratios while sufficiently large nuclei tend to grow as the bulk free energy dominates .",
    "the transition state , or critical nucleus , then sits atop this free energy barrier between the undercooled and stable phases .",
    "this picture is found in any theory that relates the nucleus size to a single reaction coordinate . in general , nucleation , as with all non - equilibrium process , can involve many degrees of freedom@xcite and may not be faithfully described by one or even a small handful of coordinates@xcite .",
    "we investigate to what extent the simplest picture holds .",
    "our analysis involves reversible work calculations , committor distributions , transmission coefficients and , most importantly , the statistics of an ensemble of reactive trajectories .",
    "we find that the traditional coordinate , @xmath0 , provides a reasonable approximation to the reaction coordinate .",
    "but other variables in addition to @xmath0 and also cluster surface area , @xmath1 , are required for a quantitative treatment .",
    "we also find that the critical nuclei in the transition state ensemble are rough and anisotropic as seen recently in experiments on colloidal and polymer systems@xcite .",
    "our system is the nearest neighbor ising model on a cubic lattice with the hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the coupling constant , @xmath10 is the magnetic field and @xmath11 is a spin variable that can either be @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the bracketed sum over @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes a restriction to nearest neighbor pairs . in these simulations ,",
    "the temperature is 60% of the critical temperature in units of @xmath16 and the field @xmath17 in units of @xmath8 .",
    "the lattice has 32 spins on an edge with periodic boundary conditions and is propagated using single spin flip metropolis monte carlo with random site selection .",
    "time is measured in units of sweeps .",
    "the temperature 0.6 @xmath18 is about 20% above the roughening temperature of the three dimensional ising model , @xmath19@xcite .",
    "one anticipates that below @xmath19 , the nuclei will tend to be cubic with relatively flat interfaces@xcite , while above @xmath19 , nuclei will tend to be isotropic and rounded@xcite .",
    "this latter regime is appropriate for the study of liquid - vapor equilibrium . using eqn .",
    "[ cnt ] , we can anticipate the typical critical cluster size assuming a spherically isotropic nucleus .",
    "taking @xmath20 ( due to the usual connections between the ising spin system and a lattice gas ) and @xmath21 ( assuming the zero temperature value of @xmath6 in the ising model ) implies a critical cluster size , @xmath22 with a free energy barrier of about 40 @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the exact numerical analysis gives @xmath24 with a corresponding free energy barrier of 18 @xmath23 ( see below ) . in any case , the size of the critical nucleus is much smaller than our system size and the height of the free energy barrier indicates that nucleation is a rare event .",
    "in order to study the dynamics of nucleation without being biased by a particular choice of reaction coordinate , many trajectories of the nucleation event need to be obtained without reference to any specific coordinate . for nucleation , such a calculation might seem difficult to carry out because the process is a rare event .",
    "the difficulty is overcome , however , with transition path sampling ( tps)@xcite . in a straightforward simulation , a large majority of computational time is spent simulating the undercooled state even though the nucleation event of interest is fleeting ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in contrast , tps allows exclusive sampling of the reactive portion of the trajectory .",
    "it employs a monte carlo walk in the space of reactive trajectories to harvest multiple examples of the rare event without wasting computational time simulating the metastable state .",
    "moreover , no reaction coordinate is required _ a priori_.    we apply tps to nucleation in the ising model and sample paths connecting nucleated and undercooled states defined by the characteristic functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28 here , @xmath29 denotes a particular configuration of the lattice and @xmath30 returns the size of the largest cluster in that configuration .",
    "the limits , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are far removed from the transition state region . in other words",
    ", @xmath26 gives a signal if a configuration is in the product region and @xmath25 gives a signal if a configuration is in the reactant region . in this calculation , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are chosen such that the free energy barrier in fig .",
    "[ umbrella ] ( see below ) separating the two basins exceeds 10 @xmath23 .",
    "this ensures that once a configuration finds itself in either the reactant or product region , it remains there for times much longer than the molecular relaxation time and that the reactant and product basins do not overlap . since @xmath0 may not necessarily be an adequate reaction coordinate , we verify this latter condition by separate simulations of configurations starting in both regions .    in these simulations , trajectories",
    "150 time units in length are sampled with the shooting algorithm@xcite : a time slice is chosen at random from a trial trajectory and then new forward and backward paths are generated using the underlying dynamics of the system . the newly generated trajectory is accepted if it connects the reactant and product regions defined by the characteristic functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "since the dynamics of this system are stochastic , a new path can be generated by simply shooting one direction at a time , as the forward and backward transition probabilities are equal@xcite .",
    "this increases the acceptance probability .",
    "a complete shooting move is defined as two such moves .",
    "we relax an initial trajectory@xcite with 25,000 moves and then 1,000 independent trajectories are harvested , one every 100 moves .",
    "convergence and adequate choice of path length are verified by calculation of @xmath35 \\rangle_{ab}$ ] , the characteristic function @xmath26 along a reactive trajectory averaged over the transition path ensemble ( not shown ) . the fact that this quantity reaches the linear regime implies that our path length is long enough to sample typical barrier crossing behavior@xcite .",
    "one often imagines that the most important reaction coordinate describing nucleation is the size of the growing cluster , @xmath0 , as alluded to in the introduction .",
    "another relevant , but secondary , reaction coordinate which is also considered is the cluster s surface area , @xmath1 . in fig . [ 2dfree ] , we project paths obtained from tps onto a contour plot of the @xmath0-@xmath1 free energy ( green circles ) .    the free energy surface in fig . [ 2dfree ]",

    "the surface area , @xmath1 , of such a cluster is the number of exposed faces .",
    "the umbrella sampling windows constrain the size and surface area of the _ largest _ cluster in a given configuration of the lattice . for @xmath36 , it is highly unlikely that there is more than one cluster of that size in any given configuration of the full system . approximately 200 overlapping windows of average size @xmath37 by @xmath38 are used . in each window",
    ", an initial configuration is equilibrated for 50,000 sweeps and statistics are taken over a subsequent run of 200,000 sweeps .",
    "the windows are linked together with multiple histograms generalized to two dimensions@xcite .",
    "a configuration is considered a member of the transition state ensemble ( tse ) if half of the new trajectories initiated from it cause the nucleus to shrink and the other half cause it to grow . from the 1,000 trajectories acquired through transition path sampling",
    ", we found approximately 3,200 members of the tse .",
    "to determine transition states with a minimum of computational effort , we check each configuration along a reactive trajectory in the following way@xcite .",
    "( 1 ) if a configuration is in either the reactant or product region , it is rejected as a transition state candidate straight away . ( 2 ) if a configuration is not in the reactant or product region , a series of additional trajectories are initiated from that configuration and @xmath39 , the ratio of paths which end up in region @xmath40 to the total number of paths initiated , is calculated after 11 , 14 , 17 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 42 and 49 trajectories@xcite .",
    "after the 49th trajectory , additional trajectories are generated up to a maximum of 100 trajectories , and @xmath39 is calculated after every trajectory .",
    "the configuration is rejected as a transition state candidate if @xmath39 falls outside the @xmath41 confidence interval around @xmath42 at any point . finally , ( 3 ) if @xmath42 within @xmath41 confidence after 100 trajectories , then that configuration is accepted as a member of the transition state ensemble .",

    "can be determined by calculating the probability that configurations constrained to have a nucleus of size @xmath52 will either grow or shrink .",

    "the final configuration of these trajectories is then judged by the characteristic function @xmath26 ( eqn .",

    "the fact that the committor distribution for @xmath0 constrained to @xmath52 is peaked around 50% indicates that it is a reasonable approximation to the reaction coordinate for nucleation .",

[ umbrella ] ) .    a plot of @xmath59 is given in fig .",
    "[ kappa ] .",
    "a plateau value of @xmath60 along n is an indicator of recrossings due to friction in the barrier region . here , @xmath61 .",
    "we argue below that the friction in our system is mainly a manifestation of the stochastic dynamics in the monte carlo trajectory .    for the calculations in fig .",
    "[ kappa ] , a set of independent configurations is drawn from the ensemble of configurations constrained to have @xmath53 and trajectories are run beginning from these configurations .",
    "the reactive flux correlation function , @xmath59 , is then calculated as an average over these trajectories .",
    "the initial velocity of the reaction coordinate , @xmath62 , is taken to be the finite difference , @xmath63 .",
    "the friction which reduces the value of the transmission coefficient in this case can be attributed mostly to the diffusive nature of a random walk on a relatively flat barrier top .",
    "to illustrate this idea , we consider a random walk beginning at the top of a free energy barrier and calculate its transmission coefficient . here",
    ", we assume that the random walker makes uncorrelated steps of typical length @xmath64 and is committed to a basin once it has traveled a distance @xmath65 corresponding to when the free energy has changed by @xmath66 1 @xmath23 relative to the barrier top .",
    "the length @xmath65 therefore depends on the curvature of the barrier near its maximum .    the reactive flux correlation function in eqn .",
    "( [ kappaeq ] ) can be thought of as a ratio of the average flux across the dividing surface of trajectories which end up in the product region to the average flux across the dividing surface of trajectories with an initial positive flux ( i.e. toward the product region ) . for a random walk process",
    ", these quantities can be evaluated analytically from a straightforward application of binomial statistics .",
    "the quantity of interest is the value of the transmission coefficient @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of steps required to fall a distance 1 @xmath23 in free energy from the barrier top .",
    "if @xmath69 , there are only two possible trajectories  one with positive initial flux which is trapped on the positive side of the dividing surface and one with initial negative flux which is trapped on the negative side . in this case",
    ", we see that @xmath70 .",
    "similarly for @xmath71 , out of four possible trajectories , one trajectory is trapped on the positive side of the dividing surface with initial positive flux , one trajectory is trapped on the negative side with initial negative flux , and the other two trajectories end up back at the dividing surface , one with positive initial flux and one with negative initial flux . in this case ,",
    "@xmath72 . in general",
    ", we see that the denominator of @xmath67 is half of all possible trajectories of length @xmath73 and that the numerator is , within the subset of trajectories of length @xmath73 which end up in the product region , the number with a positive initial flux minus the number with a negative initial flux . therefore ,",

    "the distance to 1 @xmath23 from the barrier top is @xmath80 and the typical random walk step size is @xmath81 .",
    "the latter result can be arrived at by considering the typical size of fluctuations of a nucleus of size @xmath52 . in this case , @xmath82 .",
    "alternatively , one can compute the probability of observing a change , @xmath64 , in the nucleus size after one sweep .",
    "this probability , depicted in fig .",
    "[ pdn](b ) , shows that @xmath81 is a reasonable estimate .",
    "these numbers imply that the typical random walk step size is approximately 4 which gives @xmath83 .",
    "this leads to an estimate of @xmath84 . considering the rough nature of the approximation ,",
    "this result is close to the simulation result of @xmath3 indicating that the stochastic nature of the dynamics is really playing the major role in determining the value of the transmission coefficient along @xmath0 .",
    "zeldovich was the first to write down an analytic expression for the transmission coefficient , @xmath85 , for nucleation@xcite : @xmath86_{n^*}\\right\\}^{1/2}\\ ] ] this factor , a measure of the barrier width , is an indication of the diffusive nature of nucleation dynamics . in a more modern context , we see that @xmath85 is proportional to the high friction limit of kramers expression for @xmath2@xcite .",

    "an atomistic simulation study of liquid - gas nucleation gives a value of @xmath2 two orders of magnitude smaller than 0.35@xcite .",
    "the coarse grained dynamics used in the current study takes much larger steps in configuration space than atomistic dynamics .",
    "the corresponding @xmath73 for the atomistic dynamics is thus much larger than that which we associate with the monte carlo random walk .",
