    "the dynamical systems approach to the field equations of general relativity has been an invaluable tool for gaining qualitative information about the solution space of the anisotropic but spatially homogeneous ( sh ) bianchi cosmologies ( see wainwright & ellis @xcite and references therein ) . in this approach",
    "one uses the orthonormal frame formalism of ellis & maccallum @xcite to write the field equations as an autonomous system of first - order differential equations , the evolution equations for the gravitational field .",
    "one can then apply techniques from the theory of dynamical systems to obtain qualitative information about the evolution of bianchi cosmologies .",
    "the essential step is to introduce dimensionless variables for the gravitational field by normalizing with the rate - of - expansion scalar , or equivalently , the hubble scalar .",
    "a consequence of this choice of variables is that the equilibrium points of the evolution equations correspond to self - similar bianchi models , leading to the insight that this special subclass of models plays a fundamental role in determining the structure of the general solution space .",
    "an added bonus is that the evolution equations are well suited for doing numerical simulations of bianchi cosmologies .    in order to understand the observational properties of the bianchi models , however , it is necessary to study the behavior of their null geodesics . in this paper",
    "we augment the evolution equations of the gravitational field with the geodesic equations using the components of the tangent vector field as the basic variables , thereby creating an extended system of equations .",
    "this yields a system of coupled first - order ordinary differential equations that describes the evolution of the gravitational field and the behavior of the associated geodesics .",
    "it turns out that normalizing the geodesic variables with the energy leads to bounded variables for null and timelike geodesics , which is of great advantage .",
    "it is widely believed that a highly isotropic cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature implies that the universe as a whole must be highly isotropic about our position , and thus accurately described by a friedmann - lemaitre ( fl ) model .",
    "bianchi cosmologies provide an arena for testing this belief .",
    "since the 1960s , various investigations of the cmb temperature in sh universes have used the observed anisotropy in the temperature to place restrictions on the overall anisotropy of the expansion of the universe , as described by the dimensionless scalar is the norm of the shear tensor and @xmath0 is the hubble variable . ]",

    "some of these investigations have also determined the temperature patterns on the celestial sphere in universes of different bianchi types ( see , for example , barrow _ et al . _",
    "the studies that have been performed to date , however , suffer from a number of limitations :    1 .",
    "they are restricted to those bianchi group types that are admitted by the fl models .",
    "indeed , the most detailed analyses , for example , bajtlik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , have considered only the simplest bianchi types , namely , i and v. 2 .",
    "the results are derived using linear perturbations of the fl models .",

    "this means that a tangent vector to the geodesic with @xmath143 can never evolve into a tangent vector with one or more of the @xmath37 s negative .",
    "this assumption is rather crude since the change of kasner epochs is approximately described by a vacuum bianchi type ii orbit , for which the geodesic equations , if viewed as separate from the field equations , are non - autonomous . taking this into account limits the predictability of the `` extended kasner map '' in that it can not predict if a geodesic evolves in the positive or negative direction of the stable geodesic direction .",
    "we also note that it is only in @xmath20-time that the system spends longer and longer time in each kasner epoch . in synchronous time , the interval becomes shorter and shorter .    from the above discussion",

    "the current state @xmath187 can be described by @xmath190 , @xmath80 and @xmath192 , and so the expression for the quadrupole has the general form @xmath193 when one uses the method ii ) and linearizes about the open fl model ( @xmath194 ) , one obtains a formula of the form @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 are expressed as integrals .",
    "this formula , which is valid for @xmath198 and @xmath199 , leads to bounds on the shear parameter @xmath190 that are much weaker than those obtained in bianchi types i and v ( see lim _",
    "this result shows that the bounds obtained for the anisotropy parameters in bianchi type i and v models ( see , for example bajtlik _",
    "@xcite ) , which seem to have been taken for granted as being typical , are misleading .",
    "in this paper we have shown that in the case of spatially homogeneous models , the field equations can be augmented with the geodesic equations , producing an extended set of first - order evolution equations whose solutions describe not only the evolving geometry but also the structure of the geodesics .",
    "examples of the dynamics of geodesics in some self - similar models , and in a simple non - self - similar model , in order to show the predictive power of the approach , were given .",
    "we also made some conjectures about the qualitative behavior of geodesics towards the initial mixmaster singularity in bianchi ix models by considering the geodesics structure of the kasner models . in light of the chaotic nature of the mixmaster singularity",
    ", it is expected that the geodesics will also have some sort of chaotic behavior . to confirm these speculations ,",
    "we point out that further analytic studies and thorough numerical investigations are needed .",
    "we believe that the formulation of the combined field equations and geodesic equations of this paper is very well suited for this purpose .",
    "the most physically interesting aspect of the extended set of equations is the possibility of shedding light on one of the fundamental questions concerning the cmb , namely , does a highly isotropic cmb temperature imply that the universe can accurately be described by an fl model ? as mentioned in section [ sec : temp ] , the preliminary indications are that the situation is less clear - cut than was previously thought .",
    "we now conclude by listing some related research topics .",
    "one can easily generalize the present formalism to spatially self - similar models and it is also easy to include other sources , _",
    "e.g. _ , two non - interacting fluids , a cosmological constant , or magnetic fields .",
    "it should also be possible to extend the system to include polarization .",
    "it would also be interesting if the current formulation could be generalized to facilitate a study of the temperature of the cmb for density perturbed models or models with closed topologies .",
    "for many physical purposes in sh cosmology , it is sufficient to know the tangent vector field @xmath200 of the geodesics . nevertheless , it might be interesting to find the geodesics themselves . to do so , spacetime coordinates @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) must be introduced .",
    "once this is done , a geodesic can locally be described as a curve @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the affine parameter of the geodesic . with an sh geometry ,",
    "it is natural to adapt the coordinates to the structure imposed by the sh condition .",
    "expressed in terms of coordinates , the orthonormal frame can then be written as @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are the lapse function and the shift vector field respectively ( for restrictions on the shift vector field , see jantzen & uggla @xcite ) . the spatial frame @xmath208 , where @xmath209 ( in this appendix , and only here , latin indices @xmath210 denote spatially homogeneous time independent frame indices since it is only here that this type of frame is used ) , tangent to each hypersurface , is not only invariant under the action of the bianchi symmetry group but has structure or commutator functions @xmath211 which are constants throughout the spacetime , defined by @xmath212   = { c}^{k}\\!_{ij}\\,{\\bf e}_{k } \\ .\\ ] ]    it is possible to construct the orthonormal frame explicitly in terms of local coordinates @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) adapted to the sh hypersurfaces . the spatial frame @xmath215 is characterized by the lie dragging condition @xmath216 which implies the time independent local coordinate expression @xmath217 for the invariant spatial frame .",
    "explicit coordinate expressions for @xmath218 follow from the representation of the left invariant vector fields in canonical coordinates of the second kind in jantzen @xcite .",
    "the relation between the orthonormal frame components of the tangent vector field to the geodesics and its corresponding coordinate components yields the relations    [ eq : l1l2 ] @xmath219 e_j{}^i({\\bf        x})\\ ,        \\label{eq : l2 }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath33 are the energy - normalized components of the geodesic tangent vector field . here",
    "one can choose an automorphism adapted shift in order to set certain components of @xmath220 to zero , see jantzen & uggla @xcite .",
    "one usually sets the shift to zero . in this latter case one",
    "has to add equations governing some of the @xmath220 components .",
    "these are obtained from the commutator relations and are consequences of the zero - shift gauge .",
    "we will not do this for the general case .",
    "instead we will look at an example .      in this case , with zero shift , equation ( [ eq : l1l2 ] ) becomes @xmath221 where @xmath222 .",
    "the commutator equations ( see jantzen & uggla @xcite or we , chapter 10 ) yields @xmath223 the next step is to introduce @xmath224 as new variables , but note that they are not independent of @xmath225 ( see we , chapter 10 ) .",
    "this results in the complete extended system of equations , which is necessary in order to obtain the individual geodesics .",
