    "discontinuity in @xmath93 for bekenstein  hawking entropy has been known for some time  @xcite , and it is associated with a second  order ( or continuous ) phase transition .",
    "expressions calculated from bekenstein  hawking entropy are more manageable and , for the sake of simplicity , the following analysis is performed considering only bekenstein - hawking thermodynamic properties .",
    "it is expected that results obtained with these considerations are prominently similar to the ones expected for quantum corrected properties .",
    "thermodynamic systems passing through a fist  order phase transition have physical states for which parts of the system are in different phases , or a phase coexistence , constituting a series of not homogeneous states appearing below the critical point , where phase boundaries vanish . often these states can be identified with the aid of thermodynamic diagrams , as @xmath147@xmath148 diagrams for fluids . during phase transition equation of state",
    "remain constant , therefore a mechanical and thermal equilibrium exists  @xcite .",
    "maxwell construction , is a correction to violation in van der waals equation of the requirement to have a constant pressure with volume in isotherms of phase diagram during a first  order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "it is helpful to find the critical point of a system in a first  order phase transition , if exists .    for kerr black holes isotherms in @xmath75 @xmath13 plane",
    "must be analyzed .",
    "criteria to find critical point is based on the pair of conjugate variables angular velocity and angular momentum , for which , the following requirements must be satisfied    @xmath149    recalling eq . , it implies that isothermic rotational susceptibility must be singular at this critical point @xmath150 .",
    "as showed , @xmath114 do not have any divergence and is well behaved .",
    "therefore , there is not critical point for kerr black holes .",
    "more evidence of this result can be found when constructing the isotherms in phase diagram in the plane @xmath75@xmath13 .",
    "changes in concavity of the curves are expected if the system pass through a first  order phase transition , this is the region of inhomogeneous states and it is commonly named van der waals loop , since were first observed for van der waals equation .    in order to construct the corresponding isotherm for noncommutative bekenstein  hawking kerr black holes @xmath151 , it is easier to proceed from thermodynamic fundamental relation in energy representation @xmath152  @xcite ,    @xmath153    using eq .",
    "( [ eq18]a ) for temperature , it is straightforward to obtain :    @xmath154^{3/4}+\\big(\\frac{2\\pi\\gamma t}{\\omega}\\big)\\big[\\big(\\frac{2\\pi\\gamma t}{\\omega}\\big)^2 + 1\\big]^{1/4}\\bigg\\}\\bigg)^{-1}.\\ ] ]    inverse function @xmath155 can be estimated , and it is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] for different isotherms , showing commutative case .",
    "it was not possible to find an analytical expression for this relation .",
    "as noticed in this figure , for a given value of @xmath13 there are two corresponding values of @xmath75 , which can be interpreted as two possible cases for kerr black holes , one of small mass and another with a larger one .",
    "when small temperatures are considered , it can be noticed that angular momentum have greater values available .",
    "there is no evidence of changes in concavity of the isotherms in plane @xmath75@xmath13 , which implies that there is no van der waals loop .",
    "the last piece of evidence is that if the analogous of the maxwell construction for noncommutative kerr black holes is tried to be performed , this procedure is not satisfied by any value in their domain , indicating once again , that there is not critical point .",
    "therefore , continuity of first derivatives along with the lack of critical point , indicates that kerr black holes do not pass through a first  order phase transition .",
    "negative values exhibited by material properties are directly linked with thermodynamic stability of the system .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium states are characterized by an extremal principle , either maximal entropy or equivalently , a minimum in any other thermodynamic potential . in order to ensure that those potentials are stable",
    ", they must be concave functions of their natural variables . in particular , for kerr black holes , gibbs potential @xmath156 and helmholtz free energy @xmath157",
    "must be concave functions of both temperature and angular velocity , temperature and angular momentum , respectively . using legendre transformations for kerr black holes  @xcite",
    ",    @xmath158    concavity criteria requires that second derivatives satisfy the following relations  @xcite :    @xmath159    @xmath160    @xmath161    from the above relations and results found in section [ sec:2 ] , particularly eqs . , and , it is evident that kerr black holes have regions where thermodynamic states do not meet these requirements , since @xmath93 , @xmath114 and @xmath131 are negative in those regions",
    ".    geometric interpretation in the three dimensional thermodynamic space @xmath71@xmath70@xmath13 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq46])([eq48 ] ) can be found in the corresponding figures of each response function ( see figures  [ fig04 ] ,  [ fig06 ] and  [ fig07 ] , respectively ) . for variations in internal energy ,",
    "change of sign in @xmath93 implicates that noncommutative quantum corrected kerr black holes are in weakly stable states ( where some of the stability conditions are fulfilled , which are also known as metastable states ) , for low masses , becoming unstable at greater ones , as noticed in fig . [",
    "fig04](a ) . for variations in angular momentum alone , as showed in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] , isothermic rotational susceptibility becomes negative in the region above @xmath162 , namely , greater values of @xmath13 , the system is also in weakly stable states for low values of @xmath13 .",
    "when variations in both @xmath70 and @xmath13 are considered , noncommutative quantum corrected kerr black holes are always unstable , since @xmath163 in all its dominion , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] .",
    "although thermodynamic stability of extended kerr black holes is not modified , varying the value of @xmath65 have a direct consequence on accessible weakly stable states , for example , increasing the region where @xmath93 is positive . as showed in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] , smaller values of noncommutativity parameter , force the system to exist in a larger set of metastable states .",
    "+ existence of thermodynamic instability and the divergence in @xmath93 , reveals that the system goes through a series of metastable states , from a low mass black hole to a higher mass one , in analogy to other metastable phenomena as superheating or supercooling .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of a microscopic description for black holes makes not possible to be sure that kerr black holes pass through a continuous phase transition  @xcite",
    ". however , violation of stability criteria is a strong thermodynamic argument to support this hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "an analysis on thermodynamic properties of noncommutative quantum corrected kerr black holes using an approximate relation was presented .",
    "although resulting expressions are mathematically more complicated , thermodynamic properties still retain the same functional behavior with respect to those calculated via bekenstein  hawking entropy .",
    "it was explicitly proven that kerr black holes do not pass through a first  order phase transition , since the local criteria to find the critical point is not fulfilled for any value in the domain , corresponding isotherms do not exhibit van der waals loops and the maxwell construction can not be obtained , all of which are characteristic of this kind of transition . nonetheless , some second derivatives exhibit a change of sign which is an indication that those states are thermodynamically unstable .",
    "this instability and the nonexistence of a critical point suggest that the system goes through metastable states , from a low mass black hole to a high mass one , in a continuous phase transition . regarding the effective noncommutativity incorporated in the coordinates of minisuperspace , outside vicinity where @xmath164 , changes introduced by this parameter over thermodynamic information of the system are relevant .",
    "in particular , it have a impact on stability of kerr black holes , allowing the system to be thermodynamically metastable for a wider set of states . despite only an approximated expression",
    "was considered , it allowed us to study the effect of angular momentum for quantum noncommutative black holes .",
    "it would be interesting to have a complete description for noncommutative rotating black holes , in order to compared with the results presented in ths work , in particular , those related with thermodynamic stability .",
