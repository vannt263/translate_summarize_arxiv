    "the fundamental idea is that a hot young sn atmosphere is dominated by electron scattering , which by its nature is highly polarizing .",
    "if we could resolve such an atmosphere , we would measure changes in both the position angle and strength of the polarization as a function of position in the atmosphere ( see figure  1 of leonard , filippenko , & matheson 2000b ) . for a spherical source that is unresolved , however , the directional components of the electric vectors cancel exactly , yielding zero net linear polarization .",
    "if the source is aspherical , incomplete cancellation occurs ; the resulting degree of net linear polarization varies with the amount of asphericity , as well as with the viewing angle and the extension and density of the electron - scattering atmosphere .",
    "a polarization of about 1% is expected for an asymmetry of 30% ( defined as [ 1.0 - ( minor axis / major axis ) ] @xmath8 100 ) for a typical viewing orientation ( @xmath9 to the major axis ) when modeled in terms of an oblate spheroid ( hflich 1991 ) .    from the galactic distribution and high velocity of pulsars ( @xmath10 km s@xmath11 , with individual velocities as high as 1600 km s@xmath11 ;",

    "all of the data presented in this study were obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) in polarimetry mode ( cohen 1996 ) at the cassegrain focus of the w. m. keck - i and keck - ii 10-m telescopes , and reduced according to the methods detailed by l01a .",
    "all observations were made with a 600 grooves / mm grating , blazed at 5000  , which delivers a resolution of @xmath16   , with about 1.25    pixel@xmath11 .",
    "a journal of the spectropolarimetric observations is given in table  1 .",
    "measured values for sne  1997ds , 1998a , and 1999gi are listed in table  2 .",
    "the displayed polarization @xmath17 is the `` rotated stokes parameter '' ( rsp ) , calculated by rotating the normalized stokes parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 by a smoothed fit to the polarization angle ( @xmath20 ) so that all of the polarization ( in principle ) falls in a single stokes parameter ( here , rotated @xmath18 ) . to construct the fit to the polarization angle curve we first applied a median filter to @xmath20 with a running boxcar of width 100   , which helped to eliminate extreme deviations in @xmath20 occurring over only one or two pixels ( as may result from cosmic - ray events , for example ) .",
    "we then further smoothed the resulting @xmath20 curve by replacing the value at each wavelength with the mean of a 100    boxcar centered on the wavelength .",
    "although smoothing @xmath20 to construct the rsp in this way helps to preserve a gaussian distribution of polarization values about the true polarization level when @xmath20 is a slowly varying function of wavelength ( i.e. , @xmath20 varies on wavelength scales longer than the boxcar widths used to smooth it ) , sharp polarization angle rotations will cause the computed rsp to underestimate the true polarization level . since",
    "such sharp polarization angle rotations are often seen in sn spectropolarimetry across line features , it becomes necessary to examine both rsp and ursp ( the polarization measured in the rotated @xmath19 parameter ) to determine the true polarization of some line features .",
    "a problem that plagues interpretation of all sn polarization measurements is proper removal of the isp : aspherical dust grains preferentially aligned with the magnetic field of either the host galaxy or milky way ( mw ) can contribute a polarization signal that dwarfs that of the sn .",
    "for the three sne  ii studied here , the most persuasive constraints that will be placed on the isp come from reddening estimates and the empirically derived relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the maximum isp found for a given reddening from observations of galactic stars ( serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ; see also whittet [ 1992 , p. 83",
    "] for theoretical support for this relation ) .",
    "we estimate galactic reddening from the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) . to help characterize the isp due to the mw ( isp@xmath23 )",
    ", we also consider the polarization of mw stars near the line - of - sight ( l - o - s ) to a sn contained in the catalog by heiles ( 2000 ) .",
    "we adopt the criterion of tran ( 1995 ) that a mw star should be more than 150 pc above ( or below ) the galactic plane to fully sample the mw dust .",
    "although such `` probe '' stars will not , in general , yield the exact magnitude and direction of the isp@xmath23 along the true l - o - s ( especially when the stars are more than @xmath24 away ) , they should give a general indication of the polarization in that region of the sky .    to estimate the reddening due to host - galaxy dust , we cautiously make use of the rough correlation between the equivalent width ( @xmath25 ) of the d interstellar lines and reddening found by barbon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total equivalent width ( in  ) of the interstellar d lines at @xmath28 .",
    "we treat this relation with a healthy degree of skepticism since sodium is known to be only a fair tracer of the hydrogen gas column ( especially in dense environments , where sodium may be heavily depleted ; e.g. , cohen 1973 ; cf . , phillips , pettini , & gondhalekar 1984 ; ferlet , vidal - madjar , & gry 1985 ) which",
    "may then be used to estimate the dust column .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio also varies among galaxies ( e.g. , issa , maclaren , & wolfendale 1990 ) .",
    "perhaps the most important cause of uncertainty in assigning a reddening value through this equation , though , is that our low - resolution spectra do not resolve the individual absorption systems that contribute to the line , making it impossible to estimate the effect of line saturation ( i.e. , the point at which the curve - of - growth relating line width to number of gas atoms begins to depart from a linear relation ) .",
    "from analysis of echelle spectra of 32 o and early b stars suffering reddenings between @xmath29 mag , munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) find that saturation effects begin to appear when @xmath30    for a single absorption system .",
    "when the line becomes saturated , a measured equivalent width may greatly underpredict the dust column and , hence , the reddening .",
    "for this reason , converting @xmath31 to an inferred reddening value is considered to be most robust for low values of @xmath25 .",
    "barring high dust - to - gas ratios or unusually high depletion of na gas along the l - o - s , however , the lack of _ any _ d interstellar absorption should , in principle , indicate little dust .",
    "since this may help place constraints on the isp , it is important to quantify the upper detection limit of d absorption when no feature is apparent in a spectrum . for this , we adopt the relation of hobbs ( 1984 ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34 upper limit of the equivalent width of a feature ( in  ) , when @xmath35 is the width of a resolution element ( in  ) and @xmath36 is the 1@xmath37 root - mean - square fluctuation of the flux around a normalized continuum level .",
    "this equation is technically only correct for unresolved lines in a spectrum in which the natural binning scale delivered by the spectrograph and ccd ( i.e. , the `` original binning '' ) provides 1 bin per resolution element .",
    "a more general equation , valid for both resolved and unresolved line features , is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the width of the line feature ( in  ) and @xmath40 is the number of bins per resolution element in a spectrum with the original binning . for the data presented in this study , we take @xmath41 , and @xmath42   for the width of d interstellar absorption .    in a similar way",
    ", we shall also be interested in placing @xmath34 detection limits on the strength of spectropolarimetric features in the normalized stokes parameters , @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "this is more difficult to quantify than @xmath45 since we do not , in general , know the intrinsic width of the expected features .",
    "indeed , some polarization features in previous studies are only seen in one or two ( 10    bin@xmath11 ) pixels , while others stretch across a much wider range ( e.g. , leonard et al . 2000a ; l01a ) . for any individual pixel ,",
    "the @xmath34 upper limit to detection is simply 3 times the @xmath46 uncertainty in the normalized stokes parameter for that pixel .",
    "if an estimate is made of the likely width of the feature , we shall derive an approximate upper detection limit by dividing the @xmath34 upper limit for a single pixel by the number of pixels examined .",
    "since the isp is not precisely known for the objects in this study , we introduce a new definition to characterize the total polarization change seen across a line profile that is independent of the isp value : @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the individual changes in the normalized stokes parameters compared with the nearby continuum value ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .",
    "note that @xmath50 does _ not _ measure the change in total _ observed _ polarization , @xmath51 , but is rather the square root of the quadrature sum of the individual changes in the normalized stokes parameters .",
    "that is , a polarization change in which the polarization vector only changes _ direction _ in the @xmath18-@xmath19 plane will produce a measured polarization change of @xmath52 , but a non - zero , positive value for @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , @xmath50 is a measured quantity independent of the ( generally unknown ) isp , whereas @xmath53 is not .",
    "rather , @xmath50 represents the maximum magnitude change in the polarization , and makes no distinction between polarization increases , decreases , or directional change . of course",
    ", since we do not know the exact value of the isp , interpretations dependent on whether the change is treated as a polarization increase , decrease , or directional change necessarily do not represent unique solutions .    when analyzing the polarization change across a specific line feature , we bin the polarization spectrum to 10    bin@xmath11 before determining the polarization of a line feature in order to improve the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "however , since features may be quite sharp , it often happens that the polarization change is detectable in only a few ( rebinned ) pixels . in such cases ,",
    "we carefully examine the polarization properties of the original spectrum ( always binned 2    bin@xmath11 ) to see if the polarization feature is seen consistently across many pixels or is due to a single deviant pixel , before concluding that a true polarization change exists .    in the spectropolarimetric study of sn  1999em by l01a",
    ", polarization increases were found at the location of the p - cygni line troughs of h@xmath54 , @xmath55 , and d @xmath56 ) , and a sharp polarization decrease was observed across the h@xmath57 emission profile during the photospheric phase .",
    "these features were interpreted within the basic _ ansatz _ first proposed by mccall ( 1984 ) and later extended by jeffery ( 1991b ) , that polarization peaks are naturally associated with absorption minima due to selective blocking of forward - scattered ( and hence less polarized ) light in p - cygni absorption troughs and polarization minima are associated with emission peaks due to the dilution of polarized continuum light with unpolarized line emission .",
    "the lack of a polarization increase in the h@xmath57 trough of sn  1999em was attributed to the increased contribution of unpolarized photons by resonance scattering of continuum light along with the fact that the optically thick h@xmath57  line provides a screen that effectively covers more of the sn atmosphere than the metal lines , thereby blocking relatively more polarized photons from the limb regions ( see discussion by l01a ) .    with this simple model in mind ,",
    "it is possible to solve for a lower bound on the true continuum polarization level ( @xmath58 ) in the limit of blockage of only unpolarized light ( or light with electric vectors that exactly cancel ) in a line trough and addition of completely unpolarized light in a line peak : @xmath59 where @xmath60 equals the interpolated value of the continuum flux at the location of the line feature and @xmath61 is the total flux at the line s flux minimum . equation  ( [ eqn4:pcont ] ) will allow us to set plausible bounds on the continuum polarization intrinsic to a sn , and not produced by isp .",
    "to estimate the continuum flux level at the location of an absorption feature , we fit a smooth spline over the absorption feature , guided by the continuum levels shown for the synthetic spectra of sne  ii presented by jeffery & branch ( 1990 ) .",

    "applying equations  ( [ eqn4:barbon ] ) and ( [ eqn4:pmax ] ) yields @xmath117 , but we caution that @xmath118    is well into the saturation regime if few absorption systems contribute to the line , so that the derived isp@xmath119 may underestimate the true isp contribution . a polarization measurement to only one foreground mw star within @xmath71 of sn  1999gi is recorded in the catalog by heiles ( 2000 ) , and it ( hd 89021 ) has a very small value , @xmath120 , but is only 30 pc away and therefore does not nearly probe all of the material in the galactic plane ( a star would need to be more than 183 pc away since sn  1999gi has a galactic latitude of @xmath121 ) .",

    "( 2000 ) 4 days after our observation showed sn  1999gi to be at unfiltered magnitude @xmath124 mag ; since sn  1999gi reportedly dropped an additional 0.3 mag over the next 11 days ( sarneczky et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is likely that sn  1999gi was right at the end of the plateau phase when our observation took place .",
    "the observed spectropolarimetry data are shown in figure  [ fig4:1_99gi ] , with detail of the h@xmath57  region displayed in figure  [ fig4:2_99gi ] .",
    "figure  [ fig4:5b_99gi ] illustrates the striking similarity between the total flux spectrum of sn  1999gi and a spectrum of sn  1999em taken at a similar epoch ( @xmath125 days after explosion ) .",
    "of particular interest is the remarkable correspondence of all of the absorption features that complicate the h@xmath57absorption profile . since rapid changes in the h@xmath57  profile of sn  1999em coincided with its fall off the plateau ( l01b ) ,",
    "this strengthens the argument that sn  1999gi was observed at a similar evolutionary stage in its development . a detailed discussion of the spectral development of sne  ii - p , with a particular focus on the h@xmath57  profile , is given by l01b .",
    "for this study , we note that the existing spectroscopic and photometric evidence suggests that sn  1999gi and sn  1999em may have been quite similar events and that our spectropolarimetric observation of sn  1999gi likely caught the evolutionary phase when the recombination front was just reaching the h@xmath126he boundary and the sn was beginning the transition to the nebular stage .",
    "-0.5 in -0.3 in    sn  1999gi exhibits an extremely high overall polarization level , @xmath127 ( table  2 ) , with polarization modulations evident across several p - cygni features .",
    "it is unfortunate that no other spectropolarimetry ( or broadband polarimetry ) exists for sn  1999gi , since a temporal change in the overall level would help distinguish between polarization intrinsic to the sn and that contributed by isp .",
    "the main question , then , is what fraction of the observed polarization is due to isp , and how much is intrinsic to sn  1999gi . with only a single epoch of spectropolarimetry ,",
    "it is impossible to know for sure .",
    "however , there is one characteristic of its continuum polarization that sets it apart from all other type ii objects studied thus far : it is not flat with wavelength .",
    "rather , it has a broad , asymmetric peak at about @xmath128    that gently decreases on either side .",
    "this is unlike the wavelength - independent nature of electron scattering expected for a sn atmosphere , but is reminiscent of the polarization seen in spectropolarimetry of galactic stars whose light is polarized by foreground dust .",
    "in fact , figure  [ fig4:3_99gi ] demonstrates that a serkowski isp curve ( serkowski 1973 ) as modified by wilking , lebofsky , & rieke ( 1982 ) and updated by whittet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , convincingly fits the continuum polarization exhibited by sn  1999gi .",
    "when arbitrary amounts of wavelength - independent polarization are removed from the observed polarization ( to simulate polarization intrinsic to sn  1999gi ) , the fit of the best - fitting serkowski isp curve becomes less convincing ( figure  [ fig4:3a_99gi ] ) .",
    "since the fit of a serkowski isp curve to the resulting isp becomes quite poor for intrinsic sn polarization values greater than @xmath129 , this implies that the polarization intrinsic to sn  1999gi is somewhat less than @xmath130 , and that isp@xmath76 is likely greater than @xmath131 .",
    "this suggests ( but does not prove ) that much of the polarization seen is , in fact , interstellar in nature .",
    "we shall return to a discussion of the potential power of sn spectropolarimetry for the study of the properties of dust in external galaxies in   [ sec : dustprobe ] .",
    "for now , we note that the shape , strength , and peak wavelength of the polarization seen in sn  1999gi is quite consistent with heavily reddened lines of sight to galactic stars , which would imply similar properties for the dust in ngc  3184 and the mw .",
    "-0.5 in -0.3 in    -0.5 in -0.3 in    along these same lines , the constancy of the polarization angle with wavelength across the optical spectrum ( figure  [ fig4:1_99gi]c ) also favors a large isp@xmath76 .",
    "if large intrinsic sn  polarization exists , then unless @xmath132 ( an unlikely chance occurrence ) , significant variation in the polarization angle with wavelength would be observed .",
    "for the same reason , this also favors the idea that isp@xmath76 comes predominantly from a single source , perhaps a thick dust cloud along the l - o - s , in which much of the gas has been depleted onto dust grains .",
    "this scenario would also explain how isp@xmath76 could be so much greater than the isp@xmath119 predicted by equation  ( [ eqn4:pmax ] ) .",
    "a final argument in favor of a large isp@xmath76 contribution comes from the low contrast of the polarization modulations seen across the p - cygni lines .",
    "the two strongest polarization features , near @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 ( d ) , have @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "this level of polarization change is quite similar to that observed in the line troughs of sn  1997ds and sn  1999em .",
    "if the line - trough polarization mechanism in sn  1999gi is the same as that proposed for sn  1999em and sn  1997ds (   [ sec : modulations ] ) , much stronger features should exist in sn  1999gi if it has a more highly polarized continuum .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath138 blend has @xmath139 and the d line has @xmath140 , this sets lower bounds on the continuum polarization of only @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively ( equation  [ [ eqn4:pcont ] ] ) , for sn  1999gi . a further similarity between sn  1999gi and sn  1999em",
    "is the polarization modulation seen across the h@xmath57  profile , especially the changes in the red emission wing of the profile ( see l01a , figs .",
    "14 , 15 , and 16 ) .",
    "purely to highlight the possible similarity between sn  1999gi and sn  1999em , we show in figure  [ fig4:4_99gi ] the `` intrinsic '' sn polarization that results for sn  1999gi after removing an arbitrary ( large ) isp compared with the observed polarization of sn  1999em ( which is though to suffer minimal isp ) from a later epoch .",
    "while this comparison does not prove an intrinsic similarity between the polarization of sn  1999gi and sn  1999em since the isp is not known ( and different isp values can even make polarization maxima become minima and vice versa ) , it does show that isp values exist that do make the spectropolarimetry of sn  1999gi resemble that observed in sn  1999em .",
    "regardless of the isp , though , the strength of the line features in sn  1999gi is not significantly different from that observed in either sn  1999em or sn  1997ds .",
    "although the evidence for large isp@xmath76 is compelling , we must consider arguments for significant intrinsic polarization for sn  1999gi as well .",
    "in fact , there are both theoretical and observational reasons supporting a large intrinsic sn polarization .",
    "we first present a theoretical argument .",
    "the low polarization observed in sn  1999em at early times coupled with the relatively low polarization constraints set for sn  1998a and sn  1997ds leads to the tentative conclusion that sne  ii with significant hydrogen envelopes intact at the time of explosion are substantially spherical at early times .",
    "however , there is mounting evidence supporting the idea of strongly asymmetric explosions , including the temporal increase in polarization observed in sn  1999em .",
    "the observations of sn  1999em , coming on days 12 , 45 , 54 , and 166 after explosion , as well as the observation of sn  1997ds @xmath143 days after explosion and sn  1998a @xmath144 days after explosion , all missed the crucial evolutionary phase at the end of the plateau , when the hydrogen envelope has nearly completely recombined , but before the sn begins the transition to the nebular phase . at this critical juncture",
    "the photosphere has receded through nearly the entire hydrogen envelope , yet a thermal photosphere with a large electron - scattering optical depth still exists .",
    "this creates an ideal situation for explosion asymmetry to be revealed by spectropolarimetry : if any epoch is to reveal the effects of great explosion asymmetry , this would seem to be it . at much earlier times",
    "the photosphere is located in the extended hydrogen envelope , and at much later times ( i.e. , the day 166 observation of sn  1999em ) , the electron - scattering optical depth may be quite small .",
    "therefore , the timing of the observation of sn  1999gi is unique among the objects thus far studied , and it may not be fair to favor low intrinsic polarization based on comparisons with other sne  ii observed at substantially earlier or later epochs .",
    "a simple observational argument favoring significant intrinsic sn polarization follows from the few optical imaging polarimetric studies that have been done of nearly face - on spiral galaxies ( e.g. , scarrott , rolph , & semple 1990 ; scarrott et al .",
    "these studies generally find polarization vectors aligned parallel to the spiral arms ( i.e. , perpendicular to the line connecting a point with the galaxy s center ) . from figure  [ fig4:7_99gi ] , we see that sn  1999gi is nearly due north of the center of ngc  3184 , which would predict @xmath145 , quite different from the measured value of @xmath146 .",
    "however , since the number of galaxies studied is very small and , unlike the l - o - s to a sn , optical imaging polarimetry does not probe very deeply into dusty regions ( see , e.g. , jones 1997 ) , the inconsistency between the observed polarization angle and that predicted may not be too significant .",
    "also , the lack of appreciable spectral polarization angle variation ( figure  [ fig4:1_99gi ] ) argues for a single , dominant , polarization source .",
    "-0.5 in 0.3 in    given the preceding arguments and lacking additional polarimetric epochs or independent estimates of the isp , it is quite difficult to assign a value to isp@xmath76 with absolute confidence .",
    "on the whole , the low contrast of the line features , the excellent agreement between a serkowski isp curve and the observed continuum polarization shape , and the near constancy of the polarization angle with wavelength lead us to favor the interpretation that at least a _",
    "majority _ of the observed polarization is due to isp@xmath76 .",
    "we allow for the possibility , however , that sn  1999gi may still have significantly more intrinsic polarization than the other sne ii studied . from the limits prescribed by the strength of the line features and the goodness of the serkowski isp curve fit",
    ", our preferred interpretation of the data is that sn  1999gi is intrinsically polarized at @xmath147 .",
    "low - contrast modulations ( up to @xmath148 ) in the troughs of the strongest p - cygni lines and across the entire h@xmath57  emission profile are also observed .",
    "quantifying the reddening properties of interstellar dust in all but the closest external galaxies is difficult ( see , e.g. , fitzpatrik 1998 ) . the good agreement between the polarization of sn  1999gi and a serkowski isp curve ( figure  [ fig4:3_99gi ] ) highlights a potentially powerful byproduct of sn  spectropolarimetry : sne can serve as probes of the interstellar medium of external galaxies , providing information about the alignment and size distribution of the galaxy s dust grains , its reddening law , and its magnetic field strength and direction ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "polarimetric studies of reddened galactic stars whose light is intrinsically unpolarized have established a convincing correlation between the wavelength of maximum polarization ( @xmath149 ) and the ratio of total to selective extinction ( whittet & van breda 1978 ) : @xmath150 where @xmath151 .",
    "values of @xmath149 generally fall in the range @xmath152   , with a mean value of @xmath153    providing the canonical @xmath154 ( e.g. , savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "if we assume that most of the polarization of sn  1999gi is due to isp@xmath76 , then our measured @xmath155    yields @xmath156 for the dust along this l - o - s in ngc  3184 different from that produced by the isp alone . given the constancy of its polarization angle (   [ sec : sn1999gi ] ; figure  [ fig4:1_99gi]c ) , however , this seems unlikely for sn  1999gi . ] .",
    "if the reddening to sn  1999gi could be determined , then the level of isp@xmath76 relative to @xmath87  would give a measure of the efficiency of grain alignment and hence the strength of the magnetic field in ngc  3184 ( e.g. , johnson 1982 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath149 is thought to be related to the average size of the polarizing dust grains through the relation ( whittet 1992 ) @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the mean characteristic size of the dust grains and @xmath159 is the index of refraction , with @xmath160 being typical for silicates .",
    "a @xmath149 of @xmath161    therefore suggests dust grains in ngc  3184 along the l - o - s to sn  1999gi that have an average size of @xmath162 , similar to the inferred size of typical dust grains in the mw .",
    "we conclude that the interstellar dust polarizing the light of sn  1999gi has a similar size distribution and reddening characteristics as average mw dust .",
    "this result is consistent with the results of the study by riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) , in which the _ average _ @xmath163 value in galaxies hosting sne ia is shown to be consistent with a typical galactic extinction law .",
    "spectropolarimetry of sne can therefore be a powerful diagnostic tool in the study of the ism of external galaxies .",
    "of course , the possibility of intrinsic sn  polarization complicates their use as probes . as more individual sne",
    "continue to be studied with spectropolarimetry , however , the intrinsic polarization characterizing each sn class should become better defined .",
    "the best probes will be the types of sne found to have consistently low intrinsic polarization .",
    "although too few events have been studied to warrant firm generalizations , existing evidence suggests that sne  ia ( e.g. , hough et al .",
    "1987 ; wang , wheeler , & hflich 1997 ) , and perhaps sne  ii - p at early stages , may be the most promising candidates .",
    "we present single - epoch optical spectropolarimetry of three sne  ii during the photospheric phase .",
    "none of the objects shows evidence for significant circumstellar interaction , and all probably had most of their hydrogen envelope intact at the time of explosion .",
    "our main results are as follows .    1 .",
    "sn  1997ds is a type  ii event that bears spectral similarities to the type ii - p sn  1999em at a similar observational epoch .",
    "lacking photometric data , however , we can not assign it a definitive subclassification ( i.e. , ii - p or ii - l ) .",
    "our spectropolarimetric observation of sn  1997ds took place between 33 and 46 days after the explosion , and we measure @xmath164 , with a distinct polarization modulation of @xmath81 in the h@xmath57  absorption trough .",
    "modulations greater than @xmath165 in other absorption features are not seen . from reddening considerations",
    "we conclude that sn  1997ds is intrinsically polarized by @xmath78 .",
    "1998a is a type  ii event , sharing some photometric and spectroscopic properties with the unusual core - collapse event , sn  1987a .",
    "our spectropolarimetry data were obtained between 11 and 30 days after the explosion , and we measure @xmath1 . from the low estimated degree of reddening , we conclude that the intrinsic polarization of sn  1998a is @xmath107 .",
    "although we find no evidence for polarization modulations across strong line features , we note that our data are only sensitive enough to detect sharp features above @xmath108 .",
    "1999gi is a type  ii - p event , with a plateau that lasted at least until our spectropolarimetric observation took place , between 107 and 114 days after the explosion .",
    "the total flux spectrum of sn  1999gi is nearly identical to a spectrum of sn  1999em obtained at a similar epoch .",
    "sn  1999gi has a very high observed polarization , @xmath166 , with distinct changes of up to @xmath167 seen in the troughs of the strongest p - cygni lines .",
    "a strong polarization change across the entire h@xmath57  profile is also seen .",
    "since the spectral shape of the continuum polarization closely resembles a serkowski isp curve and is inconsistent with the wavelength - independent nature of electron scattering , we believe the majority of the observed polarization to be due to isp from dust in the host galaxy , ngc  3184 .",
    "significant intrinsic sn polarization can not be ruled out , however .",
    "our preferred interpretation is that sn  1999gi is intrinsically polarized between @xmath168 and @xmath169 .    although different in detail , sne  1997ds , 1998a , and 1999gi all share common spectropolarimetric properties with sn  1999em .",
    "most importantly , neither sn  1997ds nor sn  1998a show compelling evidence for large intrinsic polarization at the early phases studied .",
    "this furthers the argument that the electron - scattering atmospheres of sne  ii with significant hydrogen envelopes may in general suffer from only modest asphericity during the early recombination phase .",
    "this is in contrast with what has been observed core - collapse events involving progenitors that have lost significant amounts of their envelopes prior to exploding ( e.g. , tran et al .",

    "the number of core - collapse events studied in detail with spectropolarimetry is still quite small .",
    "however , the basic result that evidence for asphericity increases the deeper one probes into the heart of the explosion is consistent with this study .",
    "the possibility that sn  1999gi may have possessed a larger intrinsic polarization near the end of the plateau phase than the other events studied at earlier phases would also support this trend .",
