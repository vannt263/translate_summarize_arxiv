    "we have studied cold cs atom trapping using diffractive structures with focal lengths of 500  @xmath1 m and 200  @xmath1 m .      in order to verify the planar fresnel lens designs we developed a separate test setup that directly measures the focal properties of these devices .",

    "an image of the pattern is recorded on the ccd camera and integrated along @xmath17 , the long axis of the fresnel slits , thereby generating a series of profiles of the intensity distribution along @xmath14 as a function of @xmath16 . the resulting measured intensity map in the @xmath18 plane is then compared with numerical simulations to verify design accuracy .",

    "the atoms trapped in the mmot and in the ffort are imaged by an absorption profile of a probe laser beam tuned near the @xmath21 transition . figure [ fig : detectionimagerie ] shows a schematic of the absorption imaging system which registers a double   in the @xmath16 direction . ]",
    "figure [ fig : mmotimage ] shows a typical image of the distribution of cold atoms trapped in the mmot when the trap center is located @xmath22 m away from the mirror surface .",
    "the optical thickness of trapped atoms in the mmot would be sufficient to attenuate the probe laser beam almost to extinction if tuned to the absorption resonance peak .",
    "therefore , for the mmot images , the probe is tuned off - resonance by about four natural atomic line widths in order to maintain linearity between absorption probability and atom number . for atoms trapped in the ffort ,",
    "the imaging laser is resonant with the @xmath21 transition .",
    "the distance from the mmot to the mirror plane can be varied either by mechanically moving the mirror closer to the atoms with a vernier screw adjustment or by adding a bias magnetic field that translates the cloud center .",
    "figure [ fig : numberofatomsinmmot ] shows that the minimum distance before atom loss from the trap becomes significant is @xmath23 m . we believe that the onset of this loss occurs because the vertical beams of the mmot are partially occulted by the mirror . at the center of the mirror the resulting sharp edge diffraction produces a shadow about 100 @xmath1 m",
    "wide that begins to perturb the mmot loading rate at a comparable distance from the mirror surface .",
    "[ imaging_pb ] note that since the fresnel lens is engraved on the mirror , all beams reflecting on the surface are diffracted by the structure .",
    "this includes the imaging beam , whose diffracted part is not collected by the imaging lens .",
    "there is therefore a region where we lose all information about the number of atoms . from geometrical considerations ,",
    "the size of this blind region is half the width of the structure in the @xmath17 direction , so typically @xmath24  100  @xmath1 m . in the next generation of structures",
    ", this size will be reduced to obtain a 75  @xmath1 m  x  200  @xmath1 m footprint .",
    "absorption is thus decreased by a factor of 3 but this reduction permits imaging atoms down to 35 - 40 @xmath1 m above the surface .",
    "we have carried out a series of measurements to optimize ffort loading from the mmot .",
    "figure [ fig : fortimage ] shows an absorption image of the atoms trapped in the ffort with 500  @xmath1 m focal length .",
    "we have also investigated 200  @xmath1 m focal length structures ; but , in addition to atom loss from mirror proximity ( fig.[fig : numberofatomsinmmot ] ) technical limitations associated with imaging discussed in section  [ imaging_pb ] , restrict systematic studies reported here to 500  @xmath1 m focal - length devices .",
    "we first measured the trapped atom number as a function of ffort laser power .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : trappower ] and , above a threshold of 20  mw , indicate a linearly increasing number of atoms .",
    "as the trapping laser power grows , the effective volume of the ffort grows as well  first in the central focal region , then in the small secondary maxima adjacent to the main peak ( see figs.[fig : simplanfocal],[fig : simaxeoptique ] ) . for these measurements",
    "the dipole - gradient trap laser detuning was fixed at @xmath25  nm to the red of the cs resonance line .",
    "next fig.[fig : trapdetuning ] plots the atom number in the ffort as a function of red detuning .",
    "we found that a detuning of @xmath26  nm produced the optimum atom number .",
    "the rapid fall - off at smaller detunings is due to absorptive heating while at larger detunings it is primarily due to the inverse relation between trap depth and detuning .",
    "the data shown in figs.[fig : trappower],[fig : trapdetuning ] were recorded 30  ms after extinguishing the mmot so as to purge untrapped atoms from the imaging field of view .",
    "we also determined loading efficiency , defined as the ratio of trapped atoms to the initial atom number in the mmot .",
    "the relatively poor spatial overlap between the mmot and the ffort ( compare figs.[fig : mmotimage],[fig : fortimage ] ) , results in a rather low loading efficiency of only a few per cent .    in order to evaluate the number of trapped atoms initially in the volume of the diffraction pattern of the lens",
    ", we carried out an optical pumping experiment through the structure . with the dipole trap laser off , we first pump all mmot atoms ( cs  [ @xmath6=4 ] ) to the @xmath27=3 state with a 200  @xmath1s pulse resonant on the @xmath28 transition .",
    "then , we illuminate the structure from behind with a @xmath29 resonant 200  @xmath1s pulse , which pumps the atoms back to the @xmath27=4 state . as this laser goes through the lens ,",
    "only the atoms in the diffraction pattern are affected .",
    "we then take a usual absorption image on the @xmath30 transition .",
    "atoms outside the diffraction pattern are still in the @xmath31 state , and thus transparent to this probe . comparing the number of atoms in the central peak of this distribution to the number of atom in the ffort",
    ", we can conclude that the capture efficiency of the dipole trap approaches unity .",
    "finally we also measured the atom temperature in the confining @xmath14 direction within the trap by monitoring the atom cloud ballistic expansion after trap release@xcite .",
    "the results , as a function of trap detuning are shown in fig.[fig : temptrapdetuning ] .",
    "the ffort - trapped atoms are found to be significantly colder than the atoms in the mmot ( @xmath32k vs. @xmath33k ) .",
    "the origin of this extra cooling effect has not yet been thoroughly investigated .",
    "however from numerical simulation we estimate the trapping frequency along the confining axis to be about 13  khz .",
    "since a mechanical shutter extinguishes the ffort in about 1  ms , we speculate that part of the cooling effect comes from adiabatic expansion just prior to ballistic release .",
    "note also that the temperature starts to decline with detuning beyond @xmath24 1  nm , where decreasing trap depth might lead to some evaporative cooling effect .",

    "several different directions for development of these planar , all - optical atom trapping structures remain to be exploited . as the work presented here shows , the most promising involve not only miniaturisation but _ integration _ of structure functionality directly onto the chip .",

    "we are also developing variable - focal - length lenses useful for capturing atoms far from the mirror and guiding them into very small volumes close to the surface .",
    "second , we are exploring the integration of the optical structures with on - chip microelectronic circuitry and micromechanical ( mems ) devices for each array element .",
    "dynamic addressing of the trapped cold atoms either electrically with integrated current - carrying wires or optically with laser spots provide typical examples .",
    "finally , miniaturization can be greatly improved by reducing the size of fib - milled fresnel elements while maintaining adequate trapping efficiency . further reduction to about a 10  @xmath1 m footprint should be possible by taking advantage of subwavelength surface wave phenomena@xcite .",
