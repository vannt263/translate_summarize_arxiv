    "according to the brownian theory , a ` macroscopic ' particle moving in a fluid experiences a fluctuating force as a consequence of the graininess of the fluid , resulting in dynamical friction ( df ) and diffusion in the velocity - space . understanding the nature of the df force experienced by a gravitational object that moves against a mass density background is of great importance for describing the evolution of gravitational systems and the exchange of angular and linear momentum between gravitational subsystems .",
    "there are two limits of interest in astrophysics : pure collisionless media and fully collisional gas .",
    "if the pertuber only interacts with the surrounding particles gravitationally , either the medium is collisionless or collisional , the df force is the result of the formation of an overdensity wake behind the perturber .",
    "the df depends on the nature of the force between the perturber and the background particles .",
    "departures from newtonian gravity have been proposed as an alternative to dark matter in galaxies ( e.g. , modified newtonian dynamics ; milgrom 1983 ) .",
    "ciotti & binney ( 2004 ) found that in collisionless backgrounds , the characteristic timescale for df in modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) is much shorter than in the newtonian equivalent system with dark matter .",
    "if confirmed , this result may have strong astrophysical implications and may be used to distinguish between dark matter and modified gravity . using the mond scaling found in ciotti & binney ( 2004 ) , the globular clusters in fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy should have spiraled into the centre of fornax in @xmath4 gyr , forming a visible galactic nucleus ( snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "ciotti & binney ( 2004 ) derived the mond df timescale in a restrictive plane - parallel geometry , which is a too specialized case , and in a non - standard statistical formulation .",
    "these caveats led nipoti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to carry out fully n - body simulations of the dynamics of bars in mond systems .",
    "their simulations confirmed the scaling of the df timescale predicted in ciotti & binney ( 2004 ) .",
    "still , it is not entirely clear how the background responds to the perturbation , and the description of the structure of the density wake induced by a small and massive perturber is lacking .",
    "since mond is a nonlinear theory , the gravitational acceleration induced by the perturber is affected by the presence of an external gravitational field .",
    "in particular , the df force is expected to depend on the angle between the direction of the mean field and the velocity of the perturber .",
    "our aim is to understand the nature of df in mond .    in this paper",
    "we consider gaseous media and study the structure of the density wake induced by a gravitational perturber in mond .",
    "gaseous df has found many applications in astrophysics , ranging from protoplanet accretion all the way to the motion of galaxies in clusters ( e.g. , ostriker 1999 ; kim 2007 ; conroy & ostriker 2008 ) . in a pure baryonic universe as in mond theory ,",
    "the relative role of gas becomes even more important because all the contribution to the mass is accounted for by the gas and the stars .",
    "moreover , the complementary view of hydrodynamics may provide new insights into the differences and analogies between newtonian and modified gravities . although the details on the internal density structure of the induced wake may depend on whether the system is fully collisional or collisionless , the fluid limit is useful for understanding the main conceptual features introduced by the change of the gravity law .",
    "the linear response of the gaseous medium to a gravitational perturber in newtonian gravity is well - documented ( dokuchaev 1964 ; ruderman & spiegel 1971 ; just & kegel 1990 ; ostriker 1999 ; snchez - salcedo & brandenburg 1999 , 2001 ; kim & kim 2007 ; kim et al .",
    "in all these works , a minimum radius @xmath5 in the coulomb logarithm was introduced in order to regularise the gravitational potential of a point mass .",
    "although the formulae were derived for rectilinear orbits in homogeneous and infinity media , simple ` local ' extensions have been proven very successful in more realistic situations , e.g. , smoothly decaying density backgrounds or when the perturber is moving on a circular orbit ( snchez - salcedo & brandenburg 2001 ; kim & kim 2007 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we discuss the basic concepts on the ideal problem of a point particle moving at constant speed within a uniform gas in mond ( the bondi - hoyle problem ) . in  3 , we outline the linear derivation of the basic equations for calculating the steady - state density wake generated by an extended body . in ",
    "4 we describe the structure of the resulting wake and evaluate the df force exerted on the perturber .",
    "we then discuss some implications of our results in  5 .",
    "finally , we conclude in  6 .",
    "we consider a gravitational point particle at the origin of our coordinate system , surrounded by a gas whose velocity far from the particle is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sound speed of the gas at infinity and @xmath8 is the mach number .",
    "we are interested in the wake produced by the gravitational interaction with the perturber in the context of mond .",
    "bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) suggested a lagrangian theory and also a nonlinear differential equation for the nonrelativistic mond gravitational potential produced by a mass density distribution @xmath9 : @xmath10=4\\pi g\\rho , \\label{eq : poissonmond}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 cm s@xmath12 is an universal acceleration and @xmath13 is a monotonic and continuous function with the property that @xmath14 for @xmath15 ( deep mond regime ) and @xmath16 for @xmath17 ( newtonian regime ) .",
    "only for very special configurations ( one - dimensional symmetry spherical , cylindrical or plane symmetric systems or kuzmin discs ) the mond acceleration @xmath18 is related to the newtonian acceleration , @xmath19 by the algebraic relation @xmath20 ( brada & milgrom 1995 ) . at variance with the poisson equation , mond is a non - linear theory .",
    "this implies that the gravitational potential generated by the perturber depends in a complex way on the external field @xmath0 in which it is immersed .",
    "the external field is to be thought of as the field of an enveloping system in the absence of the perturber .",
    "for example , the perturber can be a galaxy in the external field of a cluster of galaxies , or a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the field of its parent galaxy . in mond",
    ", it is crucial to include the external field @xmath0 to describe df on a perturber .",
    "the case @xmath21 is not very relevant when considering df because it corresponds to a situation where all the surrounding gas is bound to the perturber , whereas df concerns the interaction with _ unbound _ distant particles having large impact parameters .",
    "mond permits to have unbound particles if @xmath22 . for these reasons",
    ", we will assume that @xmath0 is a no - null vector field .    along this paper",
    "we will assume that the unperturbed gas density is constant all over the space and that the body moves in a uniform rectilinear orbit , which seems to be in contradiction with the inherent assumption that there is an external gravitational field .",
    "note , however , that this approximation is amply used even in newtonian dynamics where in most of the cases ( e.g. , a galaxy inside the galaxy cluster ) the gravitational body is immersed in a stratified medium .",
    "the ` local ' approximation , that is , estimating the drag force at the present location of the perturber as if the medium were homogeneous but taking appropriately the coulomb logarithm , has been proven very successful in both collisionless and collisional systems ( e.g. , snchez - salcedo & brandenburg 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "so far we are not interested in including the complications of density gradients in the unperturbed surrounding medium .      far away",
    "enough from the object , the change in the external gravitational potential can be treated as a linear perturbation .",
    "this is valid as soon as the physical size of the perturber is supposed to be small as compared to the characteristic length - scale of the medium . using the subscript @xmath23 for referring to unperturbed quantities , the linear field equation is @xmath24 = 4\\pi g\\rho_{1 } , \\label{eq : lineal}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the change in @xmath26 produced by an increment @xmath27 in @xmath9 ( milgrom 1986 ) .",
    "here @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the logarithmic derivative of @xmath30 ( in the unperturbed system ) and @xmath31 represents a @xmath32 matrix with elements @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath0 , which is @xmath35 dependent . as milgrom ( 1986 ) pointed out , @xmath25 satisfies an equation analogous to the electrostatic field equation with an inhomogeneous and anisotropic dielectric tensor .",
    "since we are not interested in the distortions in the wake by tidal forces , we will assume that @xmath0 is a constant vector all over the space .",
    "this assumption also facilitates a comparison with the more familiar newtonian case .",
    "if so , @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath34 are also constant and the linear field equation for a constant external field can be written as ( milgrom 1986 ) : @xmath36 it can be seen that the potential becomes newtonian ( but with a larger effective gravitational constant ) and anisotropic .",
    "we must note that , although the above equation was derived for @xmath37 , it is also valid when @xmath38 , regardless the value of @xmath39 . in this limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; the conventional poisson equation is recovered .      in the classical problem of a slow brownian particle in a fluid",
    ", the field particles are assumed to form a heat bath .",
    "that is , they all stay close to thermal equilibrium , despite the presence of the brownian particle and , hence , the equation of motion is solved by perturbation . in the case of a point gravitational perturber immersed in a perfect gaseous medium , the bondi - hoyle radius defines the region where the response of the gas is linear . in newtonian dynamics",
    "the bondi - hoyle radius is @xmath42 .",
    "streamlines whose impact parameter is less than @xmath43 , will bend significantly and pass through a shock . hence ,",
    "within @xmath43 it is not any longer a small perturbation . in order to regularise the gravitational potential of a point mass",
    ", one has to introduce a minimum radius in the formulae of the df drag ( @xmath44 ) .    in the appendix",
    "[ sec : appbondi ] , we estimate the bondi - hoyle radius for a point mass in mond .",
    "it is shown that the mond bondi - hoyle radius is larger than in newtonian gravity by a factor between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , depending on the angle between the velocity of the particle and the external field . to get a sense of values of @xmath47 in typical cases ,",
    "consider a galaxy of @xmath48 m@xmath49 orbiting supersonically @xmath50 in a cluster of galaxies with a sound speed of intracluster gas of @xmath51 km s@xmath52 .",
    "the bondi - hoyle radius in this case is @xmath53 kpc . in a typical galactic cluster @xmath54@xmath55 ( see , e.g. , fig .  7 in sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) , hence @xmath56@xmath57 kpc , implying that , if the interaction with the intracluster gas is merely gravitational , the linear approximation is satisfactory for studying the gaseous wake even quite close to the galaxy . for extended perturbers with characteristic size much larger than @xmath43 ,",
    "the flow is essentially laminar at any location . in the remainder of the paper we will describe the perturbation on the gas using linear theory .",
    "our aim is to study the large - scale gravitational perturbation induced by a small perturber travelling through a much larger system .",
    "we obtain that , beyond a certain distance from the perturber , @xmath58 . in other words ,",
    "the far - field wake is expected to be in the external field - dominated regime . in order to highlight the differences between genuine mond and newtonian gravity ,",
    "we restrict our considerations to situations in which the potential is dominated by the external field everywhere , i.e. , we will consider an extended perturber of mass @xmath59 and characteristic size @xmath60 , where the internal acceleration @xmath61 is not achieved . ] .",
    "the following density - potential pair , which corresponds to a `` modified '' plummer model , is an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m86 ] ) @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath60 and @xmath64 are the characteristic radii .",
    "note that for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( newtonian limit ) , it corresponds to the classical spherical plummer model .",

    "the selection of a plummer model was for analytical purposes .",
    "as long as the size of the system is much larger than the perturber , the structure of the wake and the drag force experienced by the perturber are not expected to be sensitive to the details of the potential close to the body .    in order to approach this problem",
    "analytically , we study the simplest case : an externally dominated perturber . in real life , there are some galactic dwarf spheroidal galaxies that are known to be in this regime ( e.g. , milgrom 1995 ; snchez - salcedo & hernandez 2007 ) .",
    "it is likely that some subclusters and groups of galaxies , with low internal accelerations , embedded in a main massive galaxy cluster ( such as the ngc 4911 group in the coma cluster ) lie also in this regime ( e.g. , sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) .    in eqs ( [ eq : densityaxi ] ) and ( [ eq : potentialaxi ] ) ,",

    "the emitted surface brightness @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the bremsstrahlung free - free volume emissivity , will be enhanced in the wake by : @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the column density , and @xmath242 if the gas is isothermal , or @xmath243 if it varies adiabatically ( furlanetto & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "maps of x - ray for a @xmath188 body with @xmath74 perpendicular to the external gravitational field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xrays ] .",
    "the structure of the emission in the wake is very similar to that formed by a `` compact '' gravitational perturber under newton gravity .",
    "the projected x - ray emission along line - of - sights perpendicular to the direction of motion is roughly independent of the location in the wake , except near the edges of the cone , and is given by @xmath244 as a consequence , in searching for the wake , one may expect an abrupt jump in surface brightness at the edge of its cone .",
    "we derived the gravitational wake induced by an extended body with a plummer profile having a fast density decay at large radii ( @xmath245 ) in an attempt to model the baryonic mass of a certain bound object .",
    "wakes in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario are expected to be different than in purely baryonic mond because the dark matter component in the halo of galaxies decays as @xmath246 , much more slowly than the baryonic mass density ( @xmath247 ) . to illustrate this , figure [",
    "fig : xrays ] also shows the x - ray emission generated by a pseudo - isothermal perturber with core radius @xmath60 in the newtonian case .",
    "we see that the x - ray emission in the standard cdm scenario is more cuspy .",
    "a mond wake can be distinguished from a cdm wake by detecting a sharp x - ray enhancement along the mach cone .",
    "furlanetto & loeb ( 2002 ) made a detailed analysis of the wake morphology in cdm models for collisionless and fully collisional ( fluid ) dark matter ( fdm ) in the supersonic case .",
    "they found that , because in the collisional case the dark halo is truncated by ram pressure stripping , the x - ray emission of the wake is rather flat , similar to that we find in mond . due to the quantitative similarity between the wake in mond and in fdm , many of the observational suggestions raised by furlanetto & loeb to distinguish between fdm and cdm can be used to distinguish between dark matter or mond .",
    "we can repeat the reasoning of furlanetto & loeb ( 2002 ) and argue that the observations of the wake of the elliptical galaxy ngc 1404 in the core of the fornax group marginally support cdm against mond , but the evidence is very weak . in the last decade , this type of observations has improved considerably ( e.g. , drake et al .",
    "2000 ; neumann et al .  2001 ; machacek et al .  2005 , 2007 ;",
    "sun et al .",
    "2006 ) . still , it is difficult to draw some firm conclusions because of the difficulty to isolate the structure of the gravitational wake from the hydrodynamical wake , that is the mass in the wake stripped from the own galaxy by ram pressure .",
    "we must warn that mond and fdm predict the same structure of the gravitational wake past a galaxy but , in many other astrophysical aspects , they must give different predictions since they are not equivalent .    in principle , observations of the tails of subclusters of galaxies are a potential route to distinguish betweeen collisionless cdm and mond .",
    "however , it is a well established issue that mond still requires dark matter at cluster scales ( e.g. , the & white 1988 ; sanders 1999 ) .",
    "the inclusion of an isothermal dark matter component in mond erases somewhat the abovementioned differences between the mond wake and the cdm wake .",
    "the observed displacement between the x - ray peaks and the associated mass distribution , as derived from lensing data in the bullet cluster , basically rules out fdm ( markevitch et al .",
    "2004 ) but not necessarily mond ( angus et al .  2007 ) .",
    "in  [ sec : dragmain ] we derived the df force experienced by a body of mass @xmath59 travelling on a rectilinear orbit through a homogeneous fluid medium in deep - mond and found that : @xmath248 where @xmath224 depends on the mach number and on the angle that makes the velocity of the perturber and the direction of the external field .",
    "how does it compare with the df force in a collisionless medium ?",
    "the formula for the collisionless mond df force was derived by ciotti & binney ( 2004 ) .",
    "they show that it is similar to the newtonian case but replacing @xmath249 plus an extra factor of @xmath250 : @xmath251 where @xmath252 with @xmath253 the velocity dispersion of the maxwellian distribution of velocities of background particles ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ; snchez - salcedo et al .",

    ", we can generalize the conclusion of ostriker ( 1999 ) but for mond : since the functional form of the gaseous df drag is much more sharply peaked near @xmath254 , the drag force near @xmath254 is larger in a gaseous medium than in a collisionless medium with the same density and @xmath255 . at @xmath256 , using @xmath257 ( see  [ sec : dragmain ] ) there is factor of @xmath258 difference in the mond force between the two cases . for @xmath233 ,",
    "the drag force is generally larger in a collisionless medium than in a gaseous medium , because pressure forces in a gaseous medium create a much more symmetric density perturbation in the background .    for many problems of astrophysical interest ,",
    "it is convenient to have the df inspiraling timescale for a body that is initially on a circular orbit . for circular orbits ,",
    "the above formula is correct as long as the maximum impact parameter in the coulomb logarithm is taken as @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the instantaneous orbital radius of the perturber ( snchez - salcedo & brandenburg 2001 ; kim & kim 2007 ) .",
    "consider a massive body embedded in the gaseous outer spherical envelope of a galaxy of mass @xmath261 , with circular speed @xmath262 .",
    "suppose that the gas is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the parent galaxy . in a typical galaxy ,",
    "the outer parts are expected to be in the deep - mond regime , hence @xmath263 and @xmath264 . for",
    "the sake of clarity , let us assume that the gas has the virial temperature : @xmath265 .",
    "imposing hydrostatic equilibrium , the unperturbed gas in the envelope will pursue the following profile @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the gas density at the radius of reference @xmath268 . by substituting the values for @xmath30 and @xmath269 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : parametricforce ] ) , and equating the rate of decrease of angular momentum @xmath270 to the torque @xmath271 , we find the deep - mond evolution of the orbital decay of a massive perturber s near - circular orbit in a gaseous isothermal spherical distribution @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the orbital radius at @xmath274 and @xmath275 with @xmath276 .",
    "consider now its equivalent newtonian system ( ens ) that is , the newtonian system ( dark matter plus gas ) in which the baryonic gas has exactly the same density distribution as in the mond system .",
    "the density distribution of dark matter in the ens is : @xmath277 in the ens , the dark matter component added to have the same `` dynamics '' also contributes to the df experienced by the body .",
    "the frictional force in the ens is @xmath278 the factor @xmath279 arises because the dark matter has been considered collisionless ( see , e.g. , eq .  [ 7 - 25 ] of binney & tremaine 1987 ) . equating again angular momentum loss with the torque , we find @xmath280 , the time that the body takes to reduce its distance a factor @xmath281 in the ens : @xmath282 where @xmath283const . the ratio between the df timescale in mond and in ens is : @xmath284 here @xmath285 and we used that @xmath227 for @xmath286 ( see  [ sec : dragmain ] ) . in terms of @xmath287 defined as the ratio between the mass in dark matter and the baryonic mass ( stars plus gas ) inside @xmath273 , we have @xmath288^{2}}.\\ ] ] in dwarf protogalaxies , before the gas is turned into stars , @xmath289 , and for typical values of dark matter contents in these systems ( @xmath290 ) , the gaseous df timescale in mond is @xmath291 times shorter than in the ens .",
    "condensed objects that form early ( e.g. , globular clusters ) could spiral into the centre of their host galaxy more rapidly than would be predicted in the standard cdm haloes .",
    "after a discussion about the bondi - hoyle problem , we have calculated the gravitational density wake of a perturber moving through a uniform gaseous medium in mond .",
    "a hydrodynamical treatment provides useful insight into the problem of df . in order to describe the response of the far - field medium to a small perturber , we focused on the case when the perturbation is dominated by a constant external field .",
    "the analytical knowledge of the wake structure in this simple case is useful to interpret fully non - linear simulations of the mond dynamics of realistic systems .",
    "the structure of the wake depends on the angle between the velocity vector and the external gravitational field .",
    "we have considered two cases : the velocity of the perturber being either parallel or orthogonal to the external field . for an intermediate case",
    ", the structure of the wake will lay somewhere between the extremes described here .",
    "the density wake is decomposed into two linear contributions .",
    "the morphology of the dominant contribution is a scaled version of the newtonian wake , being the mond perturbed density a factor @xmath292 larger than in newtonian gravity .",
    "the second contribution to the wake depends greatly on the angle which the direction of motion makes with the external field .    the mond df force on the perturber induced by its own wake , as a function of the mach number has been also derived and compared with the drag force in the newtonian case .",
    "it is important to know the dependence of the drag force strength on mach number to study the circularization of orbits .",
    "our results confirm earlier analyses suggesting that the df force is higher in mond than in newtonian gravity .",
    "the df drag is larger when the motion of the perturber is along the external field , especially at mach numbers between @xmath55@xmath155 . in the context of the sinking satellite problem , the recent claim that the existence of an extended globular cluster population in fornax is problematic for mond gains strength ( snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "2006 ; nipoti et al .",
    "we find that mond predicts an even faster orbital decay , especially when the satellite arrives to the halo of a galaxy before the gas has turned into stars .    in mond",
    "we show that a supersonic perturber generates a wake in the gas with a well - defined mach cone in which the the surface density increases substantially in a narrow region and then flattens .",
    "because cdm haloes extend to larger radii than the baryonic mass , the wakes in the two models have significant morphological differences .",
    "inherent to the chandrasekhar treatment of df is the assumption that the perturber interacts with _ unbound _ particles . in mond",
    ", this requirement immediately demands the inclusion of the external field . once the background gravitational field",
    "is included , two - body orbits of distant particles are unbound , the interaction of the perturber with the medium is _ quasi - newtonian _ , and the effects of distant encounters can be simply added .",
    "this topic is closely related to studies of relaxation processes in self - gravitating media . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will present a standard derivation of the df drag in collisionless systems in mond .",
