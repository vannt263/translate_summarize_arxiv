    "understanding the origin and evolution of galaxies , in particular the most massive , is one of the major challenges in modern astrophysics .",
    "many massive galaxies today are giant early - type systems ; hence the formation of spheroids should proceed to a certain extent in locked step with the mass assembly .",
    "numerical simulations based on the @xmath10 cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory @xcite predict the hierarchical mass assembly , i.e. , large cdm halos ( or dark halos ) are formed through successive mergers of smaller building - block systems . within formed dark halos ,",
    "baryons dissipate their energy and gravitationally collapse to form luminous galaxies .",
    "the simplest consequence of the above scenario is that galaxies are also formed in a hierarchical way , which means that the most massive galaxies emerge in the last phase of the formation history .",
    "thus the number - density measurements of massive galaxies , or luminous red galaxies as a proxy of them , in the distant universe are one of the key observations in recent studies of cosmology and galaxy evolution . while there has been growing evidence that luminous red galaxies are largely in place at @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recently @xcite found an evidence for the hierarchical formation of massive ( @xmath1 ) galaxies since @xmath2 based on an analysis of a large galaxy sample extracted from the near - infrared images .",
    "clustering measurements provide another important clue as to the formation and evolution of massive galaxies . in the structure formation paradigm of the @xmath10 cdm theory , dark halos",
    "are predicted to cluster together with the clustering strengths depending on their masses , in such a way that more massive dark halos have larger clustering amplitudes .",
    "thus measurements of galaxy clustering can be used to infer the underlying cdm distribution , and eventually reveal the evolutionary path of galaxies throughout the cosmic mass assembly and structure formation history .",
    "there have been a number of clustering measurements of luminous red galaxies in the local ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and distant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) universe .",
    "they found that more luminous galaxies are generally more clustered , as expected if more massive ( thus more luminous in red wave bands ) galaxies reside in more massive dark halos .",
    "clustering measurements of stellar - mass selected galaxies are much more challenging due to the difficulty in estimating stellar masses of a large number of galaxies over a wide field of sky .",
    "recently @xcite present such a measurement for galaxies with the stellar masses",
    "@xmath12 at @xmath13 , taken from the palomar observatory wide - field infrared survey , and report the evolution of the stellar - mass to total - mass ratios inferred from the clustering strengths of galaxies .    in this work we present the clustering measurements of massive ( @xmath1 ) galaxies at @xmath14 , a sample built up in @xcite , and show a simple interpretation of the measured angular correlation function by using halo occupation distribution ( hod ) models",
    ". this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce our galaxy sample and quantify their angular correlation in section 2 . the construction of hod models and the comparison with the observations are described in section 3 .",
    "the inferred properties of underlying dark halos are discussed in section 4 , then a summary follows in section 5 . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt the cosmological parameters of @xmath15 = @xmath16 = 70 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the vega system .",
    "the massive galaxy sample used in this work is taken from @xcite .",
    "below we give a short description of the sample , while we refer the reader to the above paper for the full details .",
    "the massive galaxies are drawn from 55.2 deg@xmath3 of the ukirt ( united kingdom infrared telescope ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ? * ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ii supernova survey @xcite , which enable by far the largest survey of massive galaxies to date with robust mass estimate , reaching back to a time when the universe had only half its present size . the target field is a strip region from the right ascension 1@xmath2315@xmath24 to 3@xmath236@xmath24 along the celestial equator , i.e. , the declination within @xmath25 .",
    "the galaxies have been selected from the @xmath26-band images of the ukidss large area survey data release 3 ( warren et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , and",
    "separated from galactic stars based on their @xmath27 and @xmath28 colours .",
    "we estimate that more than 95 % of the galaxies in the @xmath26-band sources are correctly extracted and that stellar contamination is negligible .",
    "photometric redshifts have been derived by comparing the galaxy colours in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath26 bands to the spectral energy distribution templates created from a part of the sample with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the estimated redshift accuracy is @xmath37 .",
    "stellar masses have been estimated by fitting the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite to the observed colours , by varying the age , metallicity , typical star - formation duration , and dust extinction of stellar populations .",
    "we adopted the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite .",
    "the fairly robust estimates of stellar mass were obtained thanks to the inclusion of near - infrared photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the estimated uncertainty @xmath38 .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath39 colours were calculated by @xmath40-correcting the observed @xmath31 , @xmath32 , or @xmath33-band magnitudes .",
    "we define the massive galaxies in this work with the stellar masses @xmath41 .",
    "the galaxies are grouped into four redshift bins , @xmath33 = 0.2  0.4 , 0.4  0.6 , 0.6  0.8 , and 0.8  1.0 .",
    "in addition , we classify the galaxies in the following two ways . on the one hand",
    ", they are divided based on their stellar masses into the @xmath42 and the @xmath5 galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "we divide them based on their rest - frame @xmath43 colours , into the blue ( @xmath6 ) and the red ( @xmath7 ) galaxy populations .",
    "the total numbers of the subsamples are summarized in table [ tab : sample_num ] .",
    ".total numbers of the massive galaxy subsamples . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note  see text for the details .",
    "+    in the hod model fitting , we consider the two cases with the different requirements for the models .",
    "they are defined in  [ sec : hodresults ] and are summarized in table [ tab : hodcases ] . as",
    "already noted , the observed acfs are so strong that very massive halos are required to reproduce them , while such massive halos are extremely rare and could not host the observed number of massive galaxies . while a small number of halos could host a large number of massive galaxies if the majority of the galaxies are satellites , such a hod results in very strong acf amplitudes at small scales , which conflicts with the present measurements ( hence is not selected in the above fittings ) .",
    "the case ( i ) models provide a comparable number of galaxies to the observed by including the host halos whose masses are presumably lower than in reality , hence the predicted acfs are weaker than the observed .",
    "therefore the derived halo masses and biases in the case ( i ) should be regarded as the lower limits .",
    "the case ( ii ) takes the opposite approach by selecting only the most massive halos in order to reproduce the observed strong acfs , while setting aside the majority of the observed galaxies presumably hosted by lower - mass halos .",
    "thus the derived halo masses and biases should be the strict upper limits .",
    "we will discuss this issue further below .",
    "the actual hod parameter values of the galaxies should be somewhere in between those of the above two extreme cases , and we conservatively adopt the above upper and lower limits in this work .        in fig .",
    "[ hod ] we show the derived bias factors and halo mass estimates as a function of redshift .",
    "it is clearly seen that the most massive galaxies mark the most biased density structure of dark matter distributions , as expected .",
    "the threshold mass for hosting a central galaxy , @xmath44 , is significantly larger for more massive galaxies , which is consistent with the general agreement that the capability of hosting massive galaxies depends strongly on halo mass .",
    "the typical mass for hosting a satellite galaxy , @xmath45 , is extremely large ( @xmath46 ) , which means that only the most massive halos could host a galaxy with the stellar mass exceeding @xmath47 as a satellite .",
    "actually we find that the fractions of central galaxies @xmath48 in the current sample are larger than 90 % in most cases .",
    "these results are the consequence of the relative weakness of the observed acfs at small scales ( one - halo terms , arising from central - satellite pairs ) compared to those at large scales ( two - halo terms , mainly arising from central - central pairs in the current case ) .",
    "while the effective halo mass @xmath49 shows a similar trend to @xmath44 with regard to the galaxy stellar mass , the difference of the @xmath49 between the @xmath42 and the @xmath5 galaxies are less than those of the @xmath44 .",
    "it is because of the negative and steepening slope of the halo mass function toward high - mass end ; increasing @xmath44 is accompanied by the smaller increment of @xmath49 since there are less and less halos as the halo mass increases .",
    "the stellar - mass to halo - mass ratios are found to be @xmath50/@xmath51 .",
    "we observe no significant difference of the ratios between the different stellar - mass classes , while the ratios might be very marginally larger for more massive systems , which indicates that the fractional mass growth rate ( @xmath52 ) of halos are comparable to or marginally lower than those of stellar systems above @xmath53 ( i.e. , @xmath54 @xmath55 ) .",
    "the major mass accretion would have already terminated for these very massive halos , while the stellar - mass assembly of the massive galaxies would also be inefficient since they are located near the high mass end of the galaxy mass function .",
    "we note that the derived effective masses of halos , @xmath56 , are comparable to the halo masses found for galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering the high fraction of central galaxies ( @xmath57 ) , the massive galaxies studied here are presumably equivalent to central galaxies of galaxy clusters . actually , the stellar masses of @xmath1 are typical of the central galaxies of galaxy groups or clusters with the halo masses @xmath8 @xcite , which is comparable to the current estimates of the effective halo mass .    fig .",
    "[ hod ] shows that the bias factor clearly decreases with decreasing redshift .",
    "it implies rapid evolution of dark matter distributions while the clustering structures traced by the massive galaxies evolve relatively slowly .",
    "the halo mass @xmath44 also shows a marginal decline toward the local universe , which might suggest that the @xmath1 galaxies are formed in progressively less massive halos with cosmic time .",
    "then it might imply that the fractional mass growth rate of stellar systems exceeds those of halos ( @xmath58 @xmath55 ) for the relatively low - mass ( @xmath59 ) galaxies , a part of which eventually evolve into the massive galaxies .",
    "we observe no clear difference of the hods between the blue and the red galaxies in fig .",
    "it contrasts with the measured acf amplitudes plotted in fig .",
    "[ aw ] , where the red galaxies clearly show higher degree of clustering than the blue galaxies .",
    "the difference between the two populations disappears in the derived hods due to the relative scarcity of the massive blue galaxies ; since the current hod models predict that both populations are mostly central galaxies and assume that the probability of hosting a central galaxy is a monotonically - increasing function of halo mass , the numerous red central galaxies require relatively low - mass halos as their hosts compared to the scarce blue galaxies .",
    "thus the derived halo masses ( and biases ) of the red galaxies become relatively low , which cancels out the higher acf amplitudes measured for the red galaxies ( indeed the larger halo masses or biases are predicted for the redder galaxies in the case ( ii ) which imposes no constraints on the predicted galaxy number density )",
    ".    however , the hod assumption that the probability of hosting galaxies is a monotonically - increasing function of halo mass could be too simplistic particularly for massive blue galaxies .",
    "it is possible that galaxies in massive , grown - up halos have exhausted most of their gas and have systematically lower level of star formation .",
    "in addition , recent studies suggest star - formation quenching mechanisms of massive galaxies as a feedback process of galaxy mass assembly , such as the onset of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these processes could systematically reduce the number of massive blue galaxies in massive halos , in a way dependent on halo characteristics and galaxy star - formation and its quenching physics .",
    "we also note that fitting the acfs of the blue and red galaxies separately with the current hod models might be problematic , since the halos hosting a red central and blue satellites , or a blue central and red satellites , can not be properly reproduced .",
    "these situations might be mimicked by the hod forms such as those given by the equation ( [ eq : hodsix ] ) , which allows an upper cut - off in @xmath60 and reproduces the hods of young galaxies presented by @xcite , but we do not obtain improved fits of the acfs with this form as compared to those with our standard model .",
    "however , since the hods of the massive blue galaxies could be significantly altered by considering the more numerous red populations , the central fractions of massive blue galaxies deduced above are rather tentative .",
    "further investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , and would require much more precise clustering measurements of massive blue galaxies .",
    "if the observed scarcity of the massive blue galaxies is due to the star - formation quenching physics rather than their need for very massive host halos , then one might be able to conclude , simply from fig .",
    "[ aw ] , that massive blue galaxies reside in less massive halos than the hosts of massive red galaxies .",
    "again , it would be the natural result if redder galaxies have started stellar - mass assembly earlier within the region where the halo mass assembly has also started earlier .    finally , we comment on the discrepancy between the hod model predictions and the observed quantities . as stated above ,",
    "the observed acfs are so strong that very massive halos are required to reproduce them , while such massive halos are extremely rare and could not host the observed number of massive galaxies .",
    "it is unlikely that most of the massive galaxies are hosted by a small number of such massive halos as satellites , since it would result in much stronger acfs than observed at small angular scales .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed and model acfs in the case ( i ) tends to increase with increasing redshift ( see figs .",
    "[ acf_results ] and [ acf_results_color ] ) . in this regard",
    ", we note that a similar discrepancy is observed in the analysis of distant red galaxies at @xmath61 by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the systematic difference between their model and observed acfs at large angular scales is roughly a factor of two ( while within the 1 @xmath62 uncertainty of their measurements ) , which is comparable to those found in our sample .",
    "as raised by @xcite , the underlying cause of the problem might be that the current hod models are too simplistic . while the current models assume that a number of galaxies hosted in a halo depends solely on the halo mass , other halo characteristics such as the mass accretion rate could affect the galaxy formation and alter the observed properties of galaxies within the halo .",
    "we also note that fitting the clusterings of different galaxy populations ( e.g. , blue and red galaxies ) at the same time may improve the situation , while such an analysis would significantly increase the number of hod parameters and require much precise data for clustering measurements .",
    "furthermore , we can raise the possibility that the evolution of halo mass function and/or bias function is not well understood ; our results might point to the earlier emergence of massive halos ( i.e. , larger numbers of massive halos at high redshifts ) than predicted in the current halo models .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the observed acfs are apparently larger than the fitted hod models at the smallest angular scales ( @xmath63 deg ) .",
    "these close pairs may represent interacting galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "reproducing such a feature by the hod models requires the detailed description of galaxy interaction within a halo .",
    "however , our focus here is the global characteristic of the host halos and such an investigation is a subject of future papers .",
    "in this work we present a clustering analysis of @xmath060,000 massive ( stellar mass @xmath1 ) galaxies taken from @xcite .",
    "the galaxies have been extracted from 55.2 deg@xmath3 of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ii supernova survey , and are nearly complete to @xmath2 with robust estimates of photometric redshift and stellar mass .",
    "we classify them based on stellar masses ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) and rest - frame colors ( blue : @xmath6 , red : @xmath7 ) , in order to reveal the difference in the spatial distributions of different galaxy populations .",
    "the angular correlation functions ( acfs ) of the galaxies are quantified using the @xcite estimator , and we find strong clustering detected for all the subsamples . in order to interpret the measured acfs , we construct halo occupation distribution ( hod ) models following @xcite and compare the predicted acfs with the observed .",
    "our major findings are as follows .    1 .",
    "the clustering amplitudes clearly show a systematic trend regardless of the measured redshift , in which the most massive , @xmath5 galaxies have the strongest clustering and the blue galaxies have the weakest clustering",
    ". it would be the natural result if more mature galaxies have started stellar - mass assembly earlier within the highly - biased region where the halo mass assembly has also started earlier .",
    "2 .   the bias factors and halo masses are systematically larger for the galaxies with larger stellar masses , which confirms that the capability of hosting massive galaxies depends strongly on halo mass . the stellar - mass to halo - mass ratios are @xmath50/@xmath51 , with no significant difference observed between the different stellar - mass classes . 3 .",
    "the inferred halo masses of @xmath56 and the high central fractions ( @xmath64 0.9 ) indicate that the massive galaxies in the current sample are equivalent to central galaxies of galaxy clusters .",
    "the bias factor decreases with decreasing redshift , which implies rapid evolution of dark matter distributions while the clustering structures traced by the massive galaxies evolve relatively slowly .",
    "the halo mass @xmath44 also shows a marginal decline toward the local universe , which might suggest that massive ( @xmath1 ) galaxies are formed in progressively less massive halos with the cosmic time .",
    "if the observed scarcity of massive blue galaxies is due to the star - formation quenching physics rather than their need for very massive host halos , then one might be able to conclude that massive blue galaxies reside in less massive halos than the hosts of massive red galaxies . 6 .",
    "the observed acfs are so strong at large angular scales that very massive halos are required to reproduce them , while such massive halos are extremely rare and could not host the observed number of massive galaxies .",
    "it might point to the inadequacy of the current hod models or a lack of knowledge about the evolving halo mass function and/or bias function .",
