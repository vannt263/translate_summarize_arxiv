    "the origin and the dynamics of the spontaneous breakdown of various symmetries in the standard model is not yet fully understood .",
    "different theoretical scenarios are conceivable and crucial experimental tests are still missing . in the electroweak sector , these tests require energies not reached so far : the question is that of the existence of an elementary higgs field , of its self - interaction and of its coupling to fermions . in the qcd sector , one meets a similar situation concerning the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sbchs ) . here too , the standardly postulated mechanism of symmetry breaking - the formation of a condensate of quark - antiquark pairs in the qcd vacuum - has not so far been tested experimentally .",
    "such tests are possible within new low - energy experiments requiring a precision not reached so far . in this talk this point will be illustrated on the example of low - energy @xmath0-scattering which is experimentally accessible in @xmath4 decays . in this domain da@xmath2ne - kloe can reach a decisive improvement and provide the first experimental evidence in favour of or against the existence of a strong quark condensation in the qcd vacuum .",
    "in the limit @xmath5 of massless light quarks , the qcd lagrangian is invariant under the group of transformations @xmath6 that consists of two independent @xmath7 rotations @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the left - handed and right - handed components of quark fields and of a common phase factor @xmath10 . this global chiral symmetry @xmath11 implies the existence of 9 vector ( @xmath12 ) and 8 axial ( @xmath13 ) noether currents",
    "@xmath14 which are conserved @xmath15 provided the physical spectrum of the theory does not involve massless quarks ( confinement ) , the chiral symmetry @xmath11 must be spontaneously broken down to the subgroup @xmath16 generated by the 9 vector currents @xmath17 .",
    "this is known to be a mathematical consequence of anomalous ward identities@xmath18 and of the vectorial character of the coupling of quarks and gluons@xmath19 .",
    "the statement of sbchs has a double meaning : first , the vacuum state @xmath20 does not share all the symmetries of the lagrangian .",
    "in particular , the 8 axial charges do not annihilate the vacuum : @xmath21 next , there exist 8 massless @xmath22 particles @xmath23 coupled to the 8 conserved axial currents : @xmath24 the quantity @xmath25 , which coincides with the chiral limit @xmath5 of the pion decay constant @xmath26 mev , plays a fundamental role .",
    "it measures a long - range correlation between the noether currents in the vacuum of the massless theory : @xmath27 the existence of this correlation implies the asymmetry of the vacuum , c.f .",
    "( [ vacu ] ) . indeed , the operator in the curly bracket on r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) transforms as the irreducible representation @xmath28 of the symmetry group @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , if the vacuum was invariant , the matrix element ( [ corr ] ) would necessarily vanish .",
    "in other words , @xmath25 is an * order parameter * : its non zero value implies sbchs . in fact , goldstone theorem guarantees that also the inverse statement is true : @xmath30 is not only a sufficient but also a * necessary * condition of sbchs .",
    "the 8 goldstone bosons are identified with the 8 lightest @xmath22 particles @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the non zero but small masses of pseudoscalar mesons reflect the nonvanishing ( running ) masses of the light quarks u , d , s. the mass term in the qcd lagrangian @xmath33 breaks the chiral symmetry explicitly .",
    "however , the chiral symmetry still remains a good approximation and the mass term in eq.([qcdl ] ) can be treated as a small perturbation , since , in the real world , @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the mass scale of the first massive bound states of the theory ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the theoretical facts summarized above represent unavoidable consequences of the qcd lagrangian . in spite of their importance ,",
    "these statements remain on a rather general level . in particular ,",
    "the basic fact of sbchs , i.e. the non - zero value of the correlator @xmath37 ( [ corr ] ) , does not by itself imply a particular chiral structure in the qcd vacuum , nor does it clarify the dynamical origin of sbchs in qcd .",
    "further progress in this direction requires a consideration of other order parameters .",
    "this point can be illustrated by an analogy with the spin systems . in the latter case",
    ", the spontaneous breakdown of rotation symmetry can be realized by means of rather different types of magnetic order in the ground state . *",
    "ferromagnets * are characterized by aligned spins    @xmath38    whereas * antiferromagnets * exhibit a rather different magnetic structure of the type    @xmath39    the order parameter which makes the distinction between these two extreme cases is the average spontaneous magnetization @xmath40 : for ferromagnets @xmath41 and this parameter plays a crucial role in the description of the response of the system to an external magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetization of an antiferromagnet is marginal or even vanishing to the extent that the ground state approaches the nel - type magnetic order .",
    "hence , the spontaneous magnetization is an example of order parameter whose non - zero value is not necessary for the spontaneous breakdown of symmetry to occur .",
    "rather , it describes the nature of the order in the ground state , i.e. the structural details of the dynamics of symmetry breaking .    in qcd , the simplest order parameter which plays a similar role as the spontaneous magnetization of spin systems is the vacuum condensate @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) defined in the chiral limit .",
    "( in this limit , the definition of the quark condensate is free of ultraviolet ambiguities . )",
    "it is convenient to describe quark condensation by a parameter @xmath44 @xmath45 which has the dimension of mass .",
    "since the operator @xmath46 carries anomalous dimension , @xmath44 is actually a running quantity depending on the renormalization scale @xmath47 . in order to get a renormalization group invariant quantity ,",
    "@xmath44 has to be multiplied by the quark mass .",
    "this fact explains , why it is so difficult to detect quark condensation experimentally : @xmath44 enters physical observables only multiplied by a quark mass and consequently , it manifests itself exclusively through tiny symmetry breaking effects .",
    "one should , of course , understand within the framework of qcd the interplay between sbchs and quark condensation .",
    "in particular , one should check and clarify the theoretical possibility ( suggested by the example of antiferromagnetism ) of sbchs without formation of a quark condensate . the first ( rather modest ) step in this direction",
    "can be reached , expressing the order parameters @xmath48 ( c.f .",
    "[ corr ] ) and @xmath44 ( eq . [ cobo ] ) in terms of the euclidean functional integral of qcd in a four - dimensional box of size l. integrating over quarks first ( giving them a small mass m ) one finds , that for large volume and small masses , the order parameters of sbchs @xmath48 and @xmath44 are both determined by the small eigenvalues of the dirac operator @xmath49 averaged over all gluonic configurations @xmath50 .",
    "( notice that in euclidean space , @xmath51 . since @xmath52 , the spectrum @xmath53 is symmetric around 0 . ) in particular , the crucial question is how dense does the spectrum become at the infrared end as @xmath54 .",
    "three types of behavior appear as particularly interesting .",
    "they are all characterized by different thermodynamical properties ( different dependence on l and on m ) and , in this sense , they appear as possible distinct phases .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     0.5 cm this discussion does not tell us what actually does happen in the qcd vacuum .",
    "however , it collects theoretical possibilities and it illustrates how sbchs ( i.e. @xmath55 ) without quark condensation can naturally arise within qcd .",
    "in fact , it is conceivable that in practice , the `` phases '' ii . and iii . coexist and compete , giving rise to a marginal quark condensate of the order @xmath56 mev , or so .",
    "it is standardly postulated that in qcd , sbchs is triggered by a strong quark condensation@xmath57 with the parameter @xmath44 of the order or even larger than the bound - state scale @xmath58 gev .",
    "( a typical value at @xmath59 gev would be @xmath60 gev@xmath61 .",
    "this believe is usually motivated by the nambu , jona - lasinio model@xmath62 in which , indeed , sbchs and quark condensation can hardly be dissociated .",
    "however , the chiral structure of the njl model differs from that of qcd : in the njl model , the mechanism of sbchs is not related to the spectral properties of the dirac operator ( [ diop ] ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the previous discussion and the emergence of the `` phase ii '' as a theoretical possibility are in fact limited to vector - like theories such as qcd .",
    "the standard scenario of a large quark condensate seems to be supported by existing lattice simulations performed at finite m and l and subsequently , extrapolated to the limit @xmath63 following extrapolation formulae valid exclusively in the phase iii .",
    "lattice regularization is known to mistreat chiral symmetry in one way or another , especially in the quenched approximation in which the most significant results are obtained .",

    "the lattice results concerning the size of @xmath64 deserve an independent experimental test .",
    "the question of the strength of quark condensation has to be settled experimentally . at present",
    ", none of the characteristic consequences of the standard strong condensation scenario has been experimentally tested .",
    "actually , there is no single experimental fact available that would allow to eliminate the alternative possibility ii of sbchs without quark condensation .",
    "the amount of quark condensation has immediate consequences for the relationship between pseudoscalar meson and ( current ) quark masses . for @xmath65 ,",
    "one has for instance @xmath66 where the dots stand for chiral log s ( irrelevant for the present , merely qualitative discussion ) and for higher order terms .",
    "a similar expression holds for the @xmath32-mass , except that at the quadratic level , a new constant appears reflecting the axial u(1 ) anomaly and the @xmath67 mixing .",
    "@xmath68 is yet another order parameter of sbchs : @xmath69 represents a long range correlation between scalar and pseudoscalar quark densities of the type similar to ( [ corr ] ) .",
    "@xmath68 can be roughly estimated using sum rules : @xmath70 .    in view of the previous discussion ,",
    "let us distinguish three cases : i ) the ( standard ) case of a * large condensate * characterized by the condition @xmath71 i.e. by the dominance of the first term in the expansion ( [ maqu ] ) .",
    "ii ) the case of * vanishing condensate * , @xmath72 and finally , iii ) the `` mixed case '' of a * marginal condensate * defined by @xmath73 in the latter case the first and second terms in eq . ( [ maqu ] ) may become of a comparable size .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in the large condensate case this ratio is predicted@xmath74 to be @xmath75 if the condensate vanishes , eq .",
    "( [ maqu ] ) implies @xmath76 in the case of a marginal condensate , the ratio @xmath77 can take any value between the two extremes @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80    [ [ section-1 ] ]    in the large condensate alternative , x is predicted to be close to 1@xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is one of the @xmath84 low energy constants introduced by gasser and leutwyler@xmath85 .",
    "it is expected to be of the order of unity . comparing with eq .",

    "this relationship is lost .",
    "the reason is that in this case , the unknown anomaly and @xmath67 mixing contributions are , in principle , of a comparable size as the quark condensate contribution .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the standard source of information on the magnitude of running quark masses are the qcd sum rules ( see e.g. @xmath93 ) .",
    "a model independent evaluation of the sum rule for @xmath94 is at present problematic , due to the complete absence of experimental informations on the size and shape of the spectral function associated with the divergence of the axial current @xmath95 , beyond the one - pion contribution .",
    "models for this spectral function that are * based on the large condensate hypothesis * lead to the value@xmath61 @xmath94 ( 1 gev ) = @xmath96 mev . in the low - condensate alternative ,",
    "the spectral function is expected to be considerably larger@xmath97 leading to a value of @xmath94 @xmath98 times the value given above .",
    "on the other hand , the sum rule determination of @xmath99 involves the divergence of the vector current @xmath100 for which more experimental informations are available .",
    "the resulting value@xmath101 @xmath102 mev ( at @xmath59 gev ) is likely to be rather independent of the strength of quark condensation .",
    "the question of the size of @xmath94 thus becomes closely related to the question of the magnitude of the ratio @xmath103 : @xmath104",
    "we have seen that different alternatives of quark condensation manifest themselves through different values of the quark mass ratio @xmath103 , the gor ratio @xmath105 and , last but not least , the running quark mass @xmath106 . up to higher order corrections",
    ", the ratio @xmath77 can be , for instance , measured comparing the observed deviations form the goldberger - treimann relation in 3 different channels@xmath107 .",
    "the current data suggest a value of @xmath77 smaller by at least a factor 2 than the standard @xmath108 , but the uncertainties of this `` determination '' are large .",
    "similarly , the issue of the magnitude of @xmath109 can , in principle , be settled , measuring with a high degree of accuracy the tiny azimuthal asymmetries in the decay @xmath110 - a project requiring a tau - charm - factory or a similar device .",
    "in addition to such projects , the experimental determination of the strength of quark condensation requires a systematic model independent parametrization of various low - energy observables in terms of the quark mass ratio @xmath77 and/or the gor ratio x. such a prametrization is provided by the ( generalized ) chiral perturbation theory .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is a systematic low - energy expansion of qcd correlation functions in powers of external momenta p and quark masses @xmath111 such that the ratio @xmath112 is kept of the order of 1 .",
    "it is based on the ward identities of the therory , sbchs and on generalities such as analyticity , crossing symmetry and unitarity .",
    "it is completely model independent .",
    "the unknown features of the low - energy qcd dynamics are parametrized by a set of low - energy constants such as @xmath113 etc .    at low energies",
    "the only relevant degrees of freedom are those of goldstone bosons .",
    "this fact has allowed a reformulation of chpt as a low - energy effective theory ( leet ) based on the most general effective lagrangian compatible with the chiral symmetry@xmath114 .",
    "the use of this technical device has greatly simplified the practice of chpt and it is at the origin of its rapid development during the last 12 years@xmath115 .",
    "leet is still completely model independent and it is equivalent to qcd , provided the low - energy constants of @xmath116 are properly associated with the order parameters of sbchs in qcd .",
    "however , the identification of all terms in @xmath116 contributing to a given chiral order @xmath117 depends on the strength of quark condensation .",
    "the standard version of chpt@xmath118 is based on the hypothesis of a large quark condensate , as defined by the condition ( [ cond ] ) : symmetry breaking effects are expanded in powers of both @xmath119 * and * @xmath89 . in the case of a marginal or vanishing condensate , the condition ( [ cond ] ) breaks down and the expansion of the effective lagrangian has to be reformulated in a way which does not treat @xmath89 as a small quantity .",
    "this leads to the generalized chiral perturbation theory@xmath120 ( gchpt ) , which at each chiral order @xmath117 includes more terms of @xmath121 than its standard counterpart .",

    "the first step * in this expansion goes back to the 1966 work of weinberg@xmath125 : @xmath126 the @xmath0 scattering is the priviledged place to investigate quark condensation precisely because the amplitude a explicitly depends on @xmath44 already at the leading order@xmath120 . in the large condensate alternative ,",
