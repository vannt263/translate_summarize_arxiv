    "[ cc ]    equations ( [ cc ] ) are invariant under rotation , dilatation and reflection on the plane .",
    "two central configurations are considered equivalent if they are related by these symmetry operations .",
    "the question of the existence and classification of central configuration is a fascinating problem that dates back to the 18th century . in 1767",
    ", euler discovered the collinear c.c.s . in 1772",
    "lagrange proved that , for any three arbitrary masses , the equilateral triangle is a central configuration .",
    "for the collinear @xmath0-body problem an exact count of the central configurations of @xmath0 bodies was found by moulton @xcite ( see also @xcite for a modern proof ) .",
    "there is a unique collinear relative equilibrium for any ordering of the masses so there are @xmath15 collinear equivalence classes .",
    "the number of planar central configurations of the @xmath0body problem for an arbitrary given set of positive masses , has been estabilished only for @xmath16 : there are always five relative equilibria .",
    "two of these are lagrange s equilateral triangles and the other three are collinear c.c .",
    "discovered by euler . already in the four body problem",
    "there is sufficient complexity to prevent a complete classification of the non - collinear relative equilibria .",
    "in fact , an exact count is known only for the equal masses case @xcite and for certain cases where some of the masses are assumed sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "even the finiteness of the central configurations is a very difficult question .",
    "this conjecture was proposed by chazy @xcite and wintner @xcite and was listed by smale as problem number @xmath17 on his list of problems for this century @xcite .",
    "the finiteness problem was settled by a. albouy @xcite for the case of four equal masses and by marshall hampton and rick moeckel @xcite for the general four body problem .    aside from these fundamental results very little else",
    "is known in terms of the classification of c.c.s for @xmath18 .",
    "one interesting open problem concerning the classification of c.c.s , recently emphasized by a. albouy and y. fu @xcite , is the following : _ prove that , in the planar four - body problem , there is exactly one convex central configuration such that two given masses are not adjacent ( i.e. they are on the same diagonal)_.    it is the scope of this paper to solve this conjecture in two particular cases .",
    "a first step in this direction was done by y. long and s. sun @xcite .",
    "they proved that any convex non - collinear convex central configuration with masses @xmath19 , such that the diagonal corresponding to the mass @xmath20 is not shorter than the one corresponding to the mass @xmath21 , must posses a symmetry and therefore must be a kite .",
    "however , in their paper , they ask whether there are asymmetryc c.c.s when the diagonal corresponding to the mass @xmath20 is shorter than the other one .",
    "we show that this is not possible .",
    "the main result of the paper is an extension of the above result , where we consider that only two of the masses are equal and at most , only one of the remaining masses is larger than the equal masses .",
    "we have the following    let @xmath22 be a convex non - collinear central configuration with masses @xmath23 .",
    "suppose that the equal masses are opposite vertices and that @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "then the configuration @xmath26 must posses a symmetry , it is unique and forms a kite .",
    "[ thmain1 ]    the uniqueness of the kite central configuration , in the hypothesis of the above theorem was proved by e. leandro in @xcite .",
    "we therefore have the following    under the hypothesis of theorem [ thmain1 ] there is exactly one central configuration .    in particular , in the case",
    "@xmath27 we prove the following    let @xmath22 be a convex non - collinear central configuration with masses @xmath28 .",
    "suppose that the equal masses are opposite vertices then the configuration @xmath26 must posses a symmetry and forms a rhombus .",
    "[ thmain2 ]    this theorem completely answers the question of y. long and s. sun @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness of the rhombus central configuration , in the hypothesis of the above theorem , is easy to prove ( see for example @xcite for a simple proof ) .",
    "we therefore have the following    under the hypothesis of theorem [ thmain2 ] there is exactly one central configuration .    in the next section",
    "we give some basic results and settings . in section 3",
    "we prove theorem [ thmain1 ] . in section 4",
    "we prove theorem [ thmain2 ] .",
    "in the appendix we list different ways to write the equations of the balanced configurations of a. albouy and a. chenciner @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank a. albouy and to an anonymous referee for their comments and suggestions regarding this work .",
    "ernesto prez - chavela was supported by conacyt mxico , grant no .",
    "firstly observe that if @xmath29 is a central configuration with parameter @xmath14 and positive masses @xmath30 then , for every @xmath31 , @xmath32{\\eta}},\\frac{q_2}{\\sqrt[3]{\\eta}},\\frac{q_4}{\\sqrt[3]{\\eta } } , \\frac{q_4}{\\sqrt[3]{\\eta}})\\in \\omega_4 $ ] is the same central configuration with masses @xmath33 and the same value of @xmath14 .",
    "so , without loss of generality we suppose @xmath34 , and we consider the planar 4-body problem with masses @xmath35    in this paper we use dziobeck coordinates , that we describe below ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "let @xmath36    for @xmath37 let @xmath38 be the area of the sub - triangle formed by the remaining three vertices of the configuration @xmath26 when deleting the point @xmath39 . as in @xcite , we define the oriented areas of these sub - triangles of the convex non - collinear configuration @xmath26 by @xmath40 when the masses are opposite vertices of a quadrilateral .",
