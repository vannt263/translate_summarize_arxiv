    "the roper resonance is one of the controversial resonances , with an abnormally large width comparative to other resonances with larger mass .",
    "it appears naturally in quark models with a radial excitation of one of the quarks @xcite , but it has also been suggested that it is dynamically generated by the meson - baryon interaction itself @xcite and thus would be essentially formed by a large meson - nucleon cloud .",
    "one of the intriguing properties of the roper is its two pion decay mode . according to the pdg @xcite",
    ", it has a 30 - 40 percent branching ratio into @xmath4 , mostly going to @xmath5 , and a small fraction of 5 - 10 percent which goes into a nucleon and two pions in s - wave and isospin , i=0 .",
    "this scalar isoscalar mode plays a very important role in all reactions involving two pion production close to threshold .",
    "the reason is that the contribution from the nucleon intermediate states cancels at threshold when the direct and crossed terms are taken into account .",
    "then the next resonance which is the @xmath6 involves p - wave couplings which would vanish at threshold , and finally comes the roper , which thanks to this non vanishing scalar isoscalar decay mode into two pions gives a non vanishing contribution to the threshold amplitudes .",
    "this has been shown explicitly to be the case in pion induced two pion production @xcite , photon induced two pion production @xcite and two pion production in nucleon nucleon collisions @xcite .",
    "the influence of the roper excitation and its decay modes in many other reactions has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has also been shown @xcite in the study of the roper excitation in the ( @xmath7 ) reaction that the roper is very efficiently excited by an isoscalar source , which should somehow be related to this scalar isoscalar decay .",
    "the evidence for this scalar isoscalar two pion decay comes mostly from the analysis of manley @xcite , where he fits the data by means of the excitation of an @xmath0 meson of about 800 mev mass and width plus the decay into @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath0 meson is what we would call now the @xmath1 meson , or in an alternative nomenclature , the @xmath8 meson , as also used in the pdg .",
    "however , the immediate conceptual problem arises , since , whatever this meson is called , the strength of the two pion distribution does not follow the shape provided by the exchange of such a heavy and broad meson . the isoscalar two pion distribution at low energies is governed by the scattering matrix of two pions in l=0 , i=0 , which has a broad bump consisting of a large background on top of the effects of the @xmath1 pole , which is now present in all modern theoretical @xcite and experimental analyses @xcite , ( see also the proceedings of the @xmath1 workshop @xcite ) .",
    "the pole of the @xmath1 appears in all these approaches with a mass around 500 mev and a width around 400 mev , and , as mentioned above , there is also a large background present in the @xmath9 t - matrix .    in the present context it is also worth mentioning",
    "that the use of chiral perturbation theory @xcite and its unitary extensions in coupled channels @xcite has brought a new perspective on the nature of the scalar meson resonances , in particular the @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , what is found in these works is that the @xmath1 is generated dynamically from the lowest order chiral lagrangian and the multiple scattering of the mesons implicit in the unitary approach .",
    "this finding and the previous statement is more than semantics , because it implies that anything having to do with the production of a @xmath1 should be considered as the production of two pions which undergo final state interaction ( in this case in the strong l=0 , i=0 channel ) .",
    "this is the philosophy taken in the present work , where we perform a theoretical study of the two pion decay of the roper , with the explicit consideration of the final state interaction of the two pions , which automatically generates the production of this two pion @xmath1 mode .",
    "the approach is hence different to the one followed in @xcite since we do not allow the direct production of a @xmath1 .",
    "yet , we aim at reproducing the same phenomenology that was fitted in the analysis of @xcite . we will show how this is possible , and even if a very different , and obviously more realistic , distribution of the two pion invariant mass is obtained for the scalar isoscalar decay mode , the coherent sum of the different mechanisms that we have leads to mass distributions of the two pions or of one pion - nucleon system , in agreement with the results that one would obtain with manley s approach of @xmath5 plus the massive and broad @xmath0 meson production .",
    "in this section we will translate the two pion decay model of the roper described in refs .",
    "@xcite to the language of lagrangian and feynman diagrams .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the model has two intermediate decay channels for the roper decay into two pions : the roper can decay either into an intermediate @xmath5 state or into an intermediate @xmath10 state .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is a scalar isoscalar meson with a mass and width of @xmath11 mev .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the two decaying modes appear in fig .",
    "1a - b .    in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite we will use here non relativistic lagrangian for the different vertices involved in the calculation . those lagrangian",
    "are given , with obvious notation , as @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the spin and isospin operators for the 1/2 to 3/2 transition with matrix elements just given by clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the amplitude for the process in fig .",
    "1a is given by @xmath16\\,\\phi_r\\chi_r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively isospin and spin pauli spinors for both the nucleon and the roper while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the isospin and spin pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the four - momentum of the roper and the two pions , and @xmath24 is the on - shell energy of a @xmath6 with three - momentum @xmath25 .",
    "finally @xmath26 and @xmath27 are isospin indices in the cartesian base for the two pions .",
    "note that since we are working in the isospin mathematical base the pions are identical particles and the amplitude has to be symmetrized with respect to the exchange of the pions . in the expression for the width we have to include a factor @xmath28 of symmetry . for the process in fig .",
    "1b we get @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total four - momentum square of the two final pions . even though the previous amplitudes are non - relativistic for the phase space integrals we shall take into account all the appropriate relativistic factors . as for the coupling constants we fix @xmath31 from the width of the @xmath6 as given by the pdg . a value of @xmath32 results . for the other coupling constants one needs information on the width of the roper associated to the two channels involved .",
    "those values and the mass of the roper we take from manley s analysis . comparing @xmath33 mev to the result obtained with the use of the feynman diagram of fig .",
    "1a one gets , while from @xmath34 mev and the evaluation of the contribution due to the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "1b one determines the product of coupling constants .",
    "the sign of this product of coupling constants relative to @xmath35 is chosen to be positive in accordance with the sign assignment done in @xcite .",
    "note also that for the first process the pions can be in both @xmath36 isospin states while for the second only @xmath37 is allowed .",
    "the total width for the roper decay into two pions that we get when taking into account both terms is given by @xmath38 mev , meaning that there is constructive interference between the two contributions . while this interference effect is also present in the amplitude used in ref .",
    "@xcite there the total width is taken to be @xmath39 mev .    in fig .",
    "2 we give two - pion invariant mass distributions obtained within the approach just described . the distribution that arises from considering the intermediate channel @xmath40 alone",
    "is represented by the dotted line and it is essentially given by phase space .",
    "the dashed line gives now the distribution corresponding to the intermediate @xmath41 state .",
    "there one sees two peaks at large and small invariant masses that are due to the presence of a @xmath42 term , with @xmath43 the three - momentum of the pions , in the amplitude square ( see eq .",
    "( [ a1a ] ) ) .",
    "the maximum for this quantity is reached when the two pions move in the same direction ( small invariant mass ) or in opposite direction ( large invariant mass ) .",
    "the invariant mass distribution corresponding to the coherent sum of the two channels is given by the full curve .",
    "the interference effect is clearly seen at large and small invariant masses . while the peak at large invariant",
    "mass increases the one at low invariant mass decreases .    in fig .",
    "3 we show pion - nucleon invariant mass distributions . as before the @xmath40 contribution",
    "is basically given by phase space , while the @xmath41 one shows a peak below the delta mass . in the total contribution",
    "the central peak is enhanced due to interference .",
    "as these invariant mass distributions are obtained from amplitudes that are fitted to experiment we will consider them as if they were true `` experimental results '' to which we can compare our own results .",
    "in our model we will consider two types of contributions . in the first type , that we shall call open - diagrams contribution , the roper decays into a baryon and a pion and then the baryon decays into nucleon - pion .",
    "no final state interaction between the two pions is considered . for the intermediate baryon",
    "we take delta , nucleon and roper itself .",
    "this contribution , whose feynman diagrams appear in fig .",
    "4 , is the equivalent in our model of the @xmath41 intermediate channel in manley s approach .",
    "the differences come from the fact that we include also @xmath44 and @xmath45 intermediate states and we take into account relativistic corrections for the vertices involved . those relativistic corrections are given for the @xmath46 transition as @xmath47 where @xmath48 stand for either nucleon or roper , @xmath49 is the pion four momentum and @xmath50 the three - momentun of the final @xmath51 .",
    "this comes automatically from the evaluation of the matrix elements of the @xmath52 operator of the pseudovector coupling of the pions to the nucleons . for the vertices involving",
    "@xmath6 we take the lagrangian of eq .",
    "[ la1 ] , where it has been implicitly assumed the @xmath6 to be at rest , and introduce the appropriate modification @xmath53 for the coupling constants we take @xmath54 , the naive quark model result @xmath55 , and for @xmath56 we use the experimental information on @xmath57 mev from which @xmath58 .",
    "we still have to fix @xmath35 .    for",
    "that we need our second type of contribution , that we call closed - diagrams contribution , and that we construct by allowing the two pions in the final state to re - scatter in the @xmath37 isospin channel .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams appear in fig . 5 and this is our model analogue of the @xmath40 channel in manley s analysis .    to fully define our model we have to give the form factors that we use to regularize the loop integrals and also the @xmath59 t - matrix for the channel .",
    "the latter will be given in the next subsection .",
    "for each of the baryon - baryon - pion vertices we take a monopole form factor @xmath60 with the same value of @xmath61 for all cases .",
    "we will discuss the cut - off dependence in the results section .    as an illustration we give the amplitude corresponding to the process in fig .",

    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 are respectively the four - momentum of the @xmath6 in the loop and of the final nucleon .",
    "for the two final pions we have already taken into account the fact that they are in an @xmath37 isospin state .",
    "similar results are obtained for the case of intermediate nucleon ( fig .",
    "5b ) or roper ( fig .",
    "all baryon propagators that we use throughout the paper contain a momentum dependent imaginary part . in all cases",
    "we use the expression for the width corresponding to the @xmath44 decay channel . for the roper we re - scale that result to its total width .",
    "we fix the @xmath35 coupling constant by fitting with our full model , including the @xmath59 t - matrix given in the next subsection , the total roper decay width into two pions . for this width",
    "we take @xmath65 mev as evaluated in the previous section and obtain a coupling constant that depends on the cut - off @xmath61 . the best agreement with the invariant mass distributions",
    "is obtained with @xmath66 gev which gives @xmath67 to be compared to 1.56 obtained in manley s approach .",
    "larger @xmath61 values as those used in ref .",
    "@xcite also agree reasonably with data .      the @xmath59 t - matrix in the @xmath68 channel we take from refs .",
    "@xcite where they use a non - perturbative approach that combines pion - pion potentials provided by the lowest order chiral lagrangian with the lipmann - schwinger equation . the pion - pion potential corresponding to fig .",
    "6 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 mev is the pion decay constant and @xmath71 gives the total energy in the center of mass .",
    "we give the potential separated into on - shell plus off - shell parts .    to obtain",
    "the t - matrix one sums an infinite set of diagrams where pions are allowed to re - scatter in the s - channel .",
    "formally on can write this lipmann - schwinger equation as @xmath72 where @xmath73 stands for the loop in fig . 7 .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the use of the off - shell part of the potential amounts to a renormalization of @xmath74 and the pion mass and then it should not be included if one uses the physical values for those quantities . in that case",
    "eq.([ls ] ) is purely algebraic and the factor @xmath73 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total four - momentum of the two incoming ( outgoing ) pions .",
    "the integral is divergent and has to be regularized . here",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite where dimensional regularization is used .",
    "the regularization mass , that is treated in ref .",
    "@xcite as a free parameter , is given by @xmath77 gev .",
    "the final expression for @xmath78 is @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and then @xmath81    we shall use this on - shell t - matrix even though the two pions in the loop in fig .",
    "7 can be off - shell .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the case of only nucleons and deltas involved the dominant off - shell contribution is canceled exactly by considering , at the same order in the chiral counting , diagrams that contain vertices with one baryon line and three pions . by analogy a three pion vertex involving the roper should also be included to produce this cancellation in the roper case .",
    "hence , as in @xcite , we shall only take the on shell part of the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "in table 1 we show the contribution to the roper decay width into two pions of our open- and closed - diagrams mechanisms for @xmath66 gev . unless otherwise indicated all results correspond to this cut - off value . the results that we obtain",
    "are compared to the contributions of the equivalent @xmath41 and @xmath40 mechanisms in manley s approach .",
    "the role of the mechanisms is different in the two models .",
    "[ table : tab1 ]    [ cols= \" < , > , < , > \" , ]     at such a small invariant mass there is almost no momentum dependence left on the amplitude .",
    "we can extract an effective coupling constant to be compared to the one defined in eq .",
    "( [ lphen ] ) .",
    "the value that we get is @xmath82 its imaginary part coming from the physical cut where the intermediate nucleon and one of the pions appear on - shell .",
    "the main difference is anyway in its module as @xmath83 this means that our model will under predict the @xmath68 two - pion production cross sections close to threshold .",
    "in contrast with our result manley s approach will give an effective coupling of @xmath84 mev@xmath85 in agreement with phenomenology .",
    "our more fundamental model is able to reproduce manley s results at the roper mass but it clearly lacks some extra contribution at low invariant masses .",
    "it is clear that other mechanisms which would contribute to the small amplitude at threshold are missing , which however would not significantly contribute in the roper region where the delta intermediate states give practically all the strength .",
    "yet , it is still remarkable that the mechanisms which we have evaluated provide the dominant contribution over such a large span of energies .",
    "we have developed a model for the the two - pion decay of the roper where we take into account the re - scattering of the two final pions by means of the use of unitarized chiral theory .",
    "the aim was to see if one could explain at a more fundamental level the need for the phenomenological decay channel @xmath86 introduced by manley and collaborators in their analyses .",
    "even though the two models have clear differences , we have shown that we are able to reproduce the same phenomenology when working at the roper mass .",
    "our models seems nevertheless to fail at low invariant masses for the roper , indicating that we still lack some extra contributions .",
    "work in this direction plus also work in the direction of obtaining microscopically a description of the nn @xmath87 n@xmath88 transition obtained in @xcite from the data of @xcite would be a natural continuation of the present work , complementing from the chiral symmetry perspective the work already done using quark models in @xcite .",
