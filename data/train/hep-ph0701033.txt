    "there has been a tremendous effort in recent years to map out the phase diagram of qcd as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that one can calculate the properties of strongly interacting matter at asymptotically high temperature or at asymptotically high densities using perturbative qcd .    at sufficiently high density and low temperature ,",
    "we know that qcd is in the colour - flavour locked ( cfl ) phase . this state is a colour superconducting state because the quarks form cooper pairs in analogy to electrons in an ordinary superconductor . in this case , the original symmetry group of qcd , @xmath6 , is broken down to @xmath7 which is a linear combination of the generators of the original group .",
    "this linear combination locks rotation in colour space to rotations in flavour space and this has given the name to the phase . in the cfl phase",
    "there is an octet of goldstone modes which arises from the breaking of chiral symmetry and a singlet arising from the breaking of the baryon - number conserving group @xmath8 .",
    "the cfl phase is a superfluid due to the breaking of the global @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "this is analogous to the superfluidity encountered in in condensed - matter systems such as @xmath9he . at very high densities , all nine modes are effectively massless since one can ignore the quark masses",
    "this implies that the low - energy properties of the cfl phase can be described in terms of an effective field theory for the massless mesons  @xcite . at moderate densities",
    ", one can not neglect the quark masses and chiral symmetry is broken explicitly .",
    "thus only the superfluid mode is exactly massless , while the the other mesons acquire masses .",
    "the lightest massive modes are expected to be the charged and neutral kaons and if the chemical potentials are large enough , there is a transition to a bose condensed phase .",
    "bose condensation of kaons in the cfl phase has been studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "qcd at finite baryon chemical potential @xmath10 is not accessible by monte carlo simulations due to the complex fermion determinant .",
    "this is in contrast to qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath1 ( still at zero @xmath10 ) where lattice simulations are possible since the functional determinant is real .",
    "thus this is a system whose phase diagram one can study on the lattice as a function of a conserved charge .",
    "lattice simulations  @xcite suggest that there is a deconfinement transition of pions at high temperature and low density , and bose - einstein condensation of charged pions at high isospin density and low temperature .",
    "in fact , the deconfinement transition and the transition to a charged pion condensate seem to coincide .",
    "the deconfinement transition is found by measuring the polyakov loop and the measurements show a sharp increase ( indicating deconfinement ) at approximately the same temperature as the onset of pion condensation .",
    "pion condensation and the phase diagram of two - flavour qcd have been investigated using chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , ladder qcd  @xcite , the chiral quark model  @xcite , the linear sigma models  @xcite , njl models  @xcite , and polyakov - loop njl models  @xcite .",
    "the pnjl models suggest that deconfinement and the onset of bose - einstein condensation are two different transitions .",
    "very recently , abuki _ et al _ @xcite have considered the possibility of probing the phase diagram of electrically neutral qcd at finite isospin chemical potential using an equilibrated gas of neutrinos .",
    "they found that a condensate of charged pions arises at large enough neutrino densities and small baryon densities , and that at even larger neutrino densities there is condensation of charged kaons as well .",
    "we note in passing the similarity between three - colour qcd at finite @xmath1 and two - colour qcd at finite @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the correspondence is given by identifying @xmath11 with @xmath10 , the charged pion condensate with the diquark condensate , and the isospin density with the quark density .",
    "bose - condensed states or colour - superconducting states may be found in the interior of compact stars if the density is high enough .",
    "in contrast to hadronic matter in heavy - ion collisions , bulk matter in compact stars must ( on average ) be electrically neutral and so a neutrality constraint must be imposed  @xcite .",
    "similarly , bulk matter must be colour neutral and if the system is in a colour superconducting phase , one sometimes has to impose this constraint explicitly .",
    "it is automatically satisfied if one uses the qcd lagrangian , but this is not so if one describes the system using njl - type models .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are no gauge fields in this model and the @xmath12 colour symmetry is global  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of models with quarks as microscopic degrees of freedom , such as the njl model , is that one can investigate simultaneously the effects of finite baryon chemical potential and isospin chemical potential . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the two - flavour njl model at finite baryon chemical potential and isospin chemical potential .",
    "we compute the phase diagram at zero and finite temperature as a function of these variables .",
    "we restrict ourselves to sufficiently low values of the baryon chemical potential such that there are no superconducting phases  @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the effects on the phase diagram by imposing electric charge neutrality and @xmath13-equilibrium .",
    "our work is a generalization of the papers by ebert and klimenko  @xcite to finite temperature and finite pion mass .",
