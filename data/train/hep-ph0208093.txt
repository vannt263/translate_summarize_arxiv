    "light neutrinos ( @xmath11 ) clustering in galactic , local hot dark halo , being an efficient calorimeter for zev @xmath1 offer the possibility to overcome the cosmic black body opacity ( @xmath12 ) ( gzk ) at highest energy cosmic ray astrophysics .",
    "these rare events , being nearly isotropic , are probably of cosmic origin .",
    "they are very possibly originated by blazars jets agn sources pointing their huge linear accelerators to us , as blac ; in standard scenario if the uhecr are originally of hadronic nature they must be absorbed by the dragging friction of cosmic 2.75 k bbr or by the inter - galactic radio backgrounds ( the gzk cut - off ) .",
    "indeed as it has been noted ( k.greisen,@xcite zatsepin , kuzmin @xcite 1966 ) , proton and nucleons mean free path at e @xmath13 is less than 30 @xmath14 and asymptotically nearly ten @xmath14 ; also gamma rays at those energies have even shorter interaction length ( @xmath15 ) due to severe opacity by electron pair production via microwave and radio background interactions ( j.w.elbert , p.sommers @xcite , 1995)(r.j.protheroe and biermann @xcite , 1997 .",
    "nevertheless these powerful sources ( agn , quasars , grbs ) suspected to be the unique source able to eject such uhecrs , are rare at nearby distances ( @xmath16 , as for nearby @xmath17 in virgo cluster ) ; moreover there are not nearby @xmath18 in the observed uhecr arrival direction cone .",
    "strong and coherent galactic @xcite or extra - galactic magnetic fields @xcite , able to bend such uhecr ( proton , nuclei ) directions , are not really at hand .",
    "the needed coherent lengths and strength are not easily compatible with known cosmic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "finally in this scenario the @xmath19 neutrons born , by photo - pion proton conversions on bbr , may escape the magnetic fields bending and should keep memory of the arrival direction , leading to ( unobserved ) clustering toward the primary source ( fargion et all 2001a @xcite , @xcite2001b ) .",
    "secondaries eev photons ( by neutral pion decays ) should also abundantly point and cluster toward the same nearby @xmath18 sources ( p.bhattacharjee et all @xcite2000),(j.w.elbert , p.sommers @xcite , 1995 ) , in disagreement with @xmath20 data ( for any direct uhecr .",
    "therefore galactic origin for uhecr might be imagined as a simplest solution ( by micro - quasars sources ) , but it contradicts the absence of any evident quadruple ( galactic plane ) or dipole ( galactic halo ) uhecr an - isotropy .",
    "a often revived solution of the present gzk puzzle , the topological defects ( @xmath21 ) , assumes as a source , relic heavy particles ( gut masses ) of early universe ; they are imagined diffused as a cold dark matter component , in galactic halo , but therefore they are unable to explain the growing evidences of clustering in @xmath20   @xmath22 arrival data and their self - correlation with far compact blazars ( blac ) at cosmic distance ( tinyakov p.g.et tkachev @xcite2001 ; d.s.gorbunov , p.g.tinyakov , i.i.tkachev , s.v.troitsky @xcite 2002 ) . in this frame work",
    "it is important to remind the fly s eye event ( @xmath23 eev ) whose association with seyfert galaxy mcg 8 - 11 - 11 ( or quasar 3c147 ) , inspired earliest articles ( @xcited.fargion , b.mele , a.salis @xcite1997 - 99 ) to solve gzk by z - shower .",
    "therefore the solution of uhecr puzzle based on primary extreme high energy ( ehe ) neutrino beams ( from agn ) at zev @xmath24 ev and their undisturbed propagation from cosmic distances up to nearby calorimeter , made by relic light @xmath1 in dark galactic or local dark halo ( @xcited.fargion , b.mele , a.salis @xcite1997 - 99,weiler @xcite 1999 , s.yoshida , g. sigl , s. lee @xcite1998 ) remains the most favorite convincing solution for the gzk puzzle .",
    "new complex scenarios for each neutrino mass spectra are then opening and important signatures of z , ww showering must manifest in observed an - isotropy , composition , spectra shape and space - time clustering of present and future uhecr data .",
    "rarest tevs gamma signals are at present the most extreme and rarest trace of high energy astrophysics .",
    "the tevs signals have shown new power - full jets blazing to us from galactic or extragalactic edges . at pevs energies astrophysical gamma cosmic rays",
    "should also be present , but , excluded a very rare and elusive cyg@xmath25 event , they are not longer being observed . while the corresponding pevs charged cosmic rays are abundantly hitting the atmosphere , these missing pevs gamma sources are very probably mostly absorbed by their photon interactions ( photo - pion productions , electron pairs creation ) at the source environment and/or along the photon propagation into the cosmic black body radiation ( bbr ) or into other diffused ( radio , infrared , optical ) background radiation . unfortunately pevs charged cosmic rays , bend and bounded in a random walk by galactic magnetic fields , loose their original directionality and their astronomical relevance ; their resident time in the galaxy is much longer ( @xmath26-@xmath27 ) than neutral ones , as gamma rays , making the charged cosmic rays more probable to be observed by nearly a comparable ratio . on the contrary astrophysical uhe neutrino signals at @xmath28ev-@xmath3ev ( or higher gzk energies )",
    "are unaffected by any radiation cosmic opacity and may open a very new exciting window to high energy astrophysics .",
    "lower energy astrophysical uhe @xmath1 at @xmath29ev-@xmath30ev should also be present , but their signals are ( probably ) drowned by the dominant diffused atmospheric @xmath1 secondaries noises produced by the same charged ( and smeared ) uhe cosmic rays ( while hitting terrestrial atmosphere ) , the so called atmospheric neutrinos . in a very far corner ,",
    "at lowest ( mevs ) energy windows , the abundant and steady solar neutrino flux and the prompt ( but rarer ) neutrino burst from a nearby super - novae ( sn 1987a ) , have been in last twenty years , already successfully explored .",
    "the uhe @xmath28ev-@xmath31ev",
    "@xmath1 s astronomy , being weakly interacting and rarer , may be captured mainly inside huge volumes , bigger than super - kamiokande ones ; at present most popular detectors consider underground ones ( cubic kilometer size like amanda - nestor ) or ( at higher energy @xmath3ev-@xmath32ev ) the widest terrestrial atmospheric sheet volumes ( auger - array telescope or euso atmospheric detectors ) . underground @xmath8 detection is based mainly on @xmath33 ( above hundred tevs energies , after their interaction with matter ) leading to @xmath34 kilometer size lepton tracks @xcite .",
    "rarest atmospheric horizontal shower are also expected by @xmath1 interactions in air ( and , as we shall discuss , in the earth crust ) .",
    "while @xmath8 detectors are optimal for pevs neutrino muons , the atmospheric detectors ( auger - euso like ) exhibit a minimal threshold at highest ( @xmath35 ) energies .",
    "if relic neutrinos have a mass much larger than their average thermal energy ( 1.9 @xmath37 @xmath38 ev ) they may cluster in galactic or local group halos ; at evs masses the clustering seem very plausible and it may play a role in dark hot cosmology@xcite .",
    "the relevant role in astrophysics and cosmology of neutrino mass is covered in recent @xcite their scattering with incoming extra - galactic ehe neutrinos create relativistic z whose nucleon decay in cascades could contribute or dominate the observed uhecr flux at @xmath39 edges .",
    "-channel , cross sections as a function of the center of mass energy in @xmath40 .",
    "these cross - sections are estimated also in average ( z ) as well for each possible t - channel lepton pairs .",
    "the averaged t - channel averaged the multiplicity of flavours pairs @xmath41 , @xmath42 respect to neutrino pair annihilations into z neutral boson .",
    "the z - ww - zz showering has to be boosted by lorentz transform to show their behaviour at laboratory system.,height=321 ]     channels .",
    "we calculated the elecro - magnetic contribution due to the t - channel @xmath43 interactions .",
    "we used lep data for z decay and considered w decay roughly in the same way as z one .",
    "we assumed that an average number of 37 particles is produced during a z ( w ) hadronic decay .",
    "the number of prompt pions both charged ( 18 ) and neutral ( 9 ) , in the hadronic decay is increased by 8 and 4 respectively due to the decay of @xmath37 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 particles .",
    "we assumed that the most energetic neutrinos produced in the hadronic decay mainly come from charged pion decay .",
    "so their number is roughly three times the number of @xmath48 s .",
    "uhe photons are mainly relics of neutral pions .",
    "most of the @xmath2 radiation will be degraded around pev energies by @xmath49 pair production with cosmic 2.75 k bbr , or with cosmic radio background .",
    "the electron pairs instead , are mainly relics of charged pions and will rapidly lose energies into synchrotron radiation .",
    "the contribution of leptonic z ( w ) decay is also considered and calculated in the table above and below.,height=188 ]    neutrino mass existence related to its flavour mixing has been reinforced by super - kamiokande evidence for atmospheric neutrino anomaly via @xmath50 oscillations and more compelling evidence from gallex and sno solar neutrino mixing data .",
    "consequently there are at least two main extreme scenario for hot dark halos : either @xmath51 are both extremely light ( @xmath52 ) and therefore energetic and fast running in hot dark neutrino halo shaped into wide , smeared and spread out to local group sizes , or @xmath53 may share nearly degenerated ( @xmath54 ) masses . within the latter fine - tuned neutrino mass case ( @xmath55 )",
    "( see fig,2 ) , ( recently found possibly hidden in a double beta decay signal ) the z peak @xmath56 interaction ( see fig.1 ) ( d.fargion,a.salis @xcite , d.fargion , b.mele , a.salis @xcite1997 - 99,weiler @xcite 1999 , s.yoshida , g. sigl , s. lee @xcite1998 ) will be the favorite one .     and its showering into different channels as above . in the present extreme case",
    "the relic neutrino masses have been assumed with wide mass differences just compatible both with super - kamiokande and relic @xmath57 temperature .",
    "the their values have been fine tuned to explain observed gzk- uhecr tail : @xmath58 and @xmath59 . a neutrino density difference between the two masses has been assumed , considering the lightest @xmath59 neutrino at relativistic regime .",
    "the incoming uhe neutrino fluence has been assumed growing linearly @xcite with energy .",
    "its value is increased by a factor 2 and 20 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 respect the previous ones fig.2 .",
    "the `` z resonance '' curve shows its averaged @xmath62 resonant `` ghost '' cross - section peaked at @xmath63 and @xmath61 , just near grand unification energies .",
    "each channel shower has been normalized in analogy to table 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and its showering into different channels as above . in the present extreme case",
    "the relic neutrino masses have been assumed with wide mass differences just compatible both with super - kamiokande and relic @xmath57 temperature .",
    "the their values have been fine tuned to explain observed gzk- uhecr tail : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "the `` z resonance '' curve shows its averaged @xmath62 resonant `` ghost '' cross - section peaked at @xmath63 and @xmath61 , just near grand unification energies .",
    "each channel shower has been normalized in analogy to table 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the second case ( for heavier non constrained neutrino mass ( @xmath64 ) ) only a @xmath65 d.fargion,a.salis @xcite , d.fargion , b.mele , a.salis @xcite1997 - 99 , and the additional @xmath66 interactions , ( see the cross - section in fig.1)(fargion et all .",
    "2001a , b @xcite , @xcite ) reconsidered here will be the only ones able to solve the gzk puzzle .",
    "indeed the relic neutrino mass within hdm models in galactic halo near @xmath67 , corresponds to a lower and @xmath62 resonant incoming energy @xmath68 .",
    "this resonant incoming neutrino energy is showering mainly a small energy fraction into nucleons ( @xmath69 ) , ( see @xmath70 below ) , at energies @xmath71 quite below : @xmath72 .",
    "therefore too heavy ( @xmath73 ) neutrino mass are not fit to solve gzk by z - resonance ; on the contrary ww , zz showering as well as t - channel showering may naturally keep open the solution . in particular",
    "the overlapping of both the z and the ww , zz channels described in fig.1 , for @xmath74 while solving the uhecr above gzk they must pile up ( by z - resonance peak activity ) events at @xmath75 , leading to a bump in agasa data .",
    "there is indeed a first marginal evidence of such a uhecr bump in agasa and yakutsk data that may stand for this interpretation .",
    "more detailed data are needed to verify such very exciting possibility .",
    "similar result regarding the fine tuned relic mass at @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( however ignoring the ww zz and t - channels and invoking very hard uhe neutrino spectra ) have been independently reported recently ( fodor , katz , ringwald @xcite ) .",
    "we notice here ( for the first time ) and predict that the fine - tuned @xmath78 mass ( following atmospheric and solar mass splitting ) being a nearly degenerated mass value , must induce , just above @xmath79 , the uhecr spectra into a very sharp z - showering knee,(or cut - off ) , ( see fig.3 above , uhecr p , n , pink curve ) ; this z - knee cut - off might be soon observable ( or not ) just beyond ( hires , agasa , auger ) detection corner .",
    "the lighter the mass the higher energy is the z - knee cut - off .",
    "one of the weak point of z - shower model is related to the relic @xmath1 number density clustering that define the probability of the z showering .",
    "indeed let us briefly remind the role of relic @xmath1 mass and their velocity spread within fermi - dirac maximal allowed number density:@xmath80 .",
    "this formula imply that neutrino number density contrast is bounded by the cube of the inverse of neutrino mass and by the cube of the local group velocity spread .",
    "the @xmath1 number density problem may be faced either with heavier @xmath1 mass or ( for lightest masses ) with extreme hard uhe neutrino fluxes @xcite or finally with extra relic neutrino degenerancy @xcite .",
    "the first case is somehow exaggerating the incoming uhe @xmath1 flux , hidden just below known bounds by goldstone experiment on zev neutrinos .",
    "the expected @xmath2 pollution of such huge z - showering fluxes are also bounded by egret data ; cosmic degenerancy ( chemical potential ) is increasing only by few unity the target density . however",
    "( fargion et all 2001a,2001b ) there may exist , well within or beyond standard cosmology , a relevant relic energetic neutrino ( @xmath81)injection due to stellar , super - novae , agns , blacs , gamma ray bursts , soft gamma repeaters , black holes or mini - bh past activities at large redshift ( @xmath82 ) , presently red - shifted into a ev @xmath1 spectra , piling into a dense relativistic relic neutrino grey - body spectra . in this windy relativistic ( or ultra relativistic ) neutrino cosmology,(eventually leading to a neutrino radiation dominated universe ) , the halo size ( to be considered ) is nearly coincident with the gzk one for uhecr nucleons and gammas(@xmath83 ) .",
    "therefore , while the isotropic uhecr behaviour is guaranteed , a puzzle related to the non observed uniform spectra distribution seem to persist .",
    "nevertheless the same uhe neutrino - relic neutrino scattering cross - sections ( figure 1 ) _ do not _ follow a flat spectra , ( as well as any convolutions with hypothetical @xmath1 grey body spectra ) .",
    "this may explain why we may leave in a homogeneous relic relativistic neutrino component at evs energies as well as why we do observe a non - uniform uhecr spectra ( reflecting non - homogeneous z - ww - zz channels ) .",
    "important and often underestimated signal will produce uhe electrons pairs ( by z decay ) whose final trace are tevs photons able to break the ir - tev cosmic cut - off .",
    "the hadronic tail of the z or @xmath84 cascade maybe the source of final nucleons @xmath69 able to explain uhecr events .",
    "the same @xmath85 interactions are source of z and w that decay in rich shower ramification @xcite    gamma photons at energies @xmath86 - @xmath87 , secondary of z - showering cascades , may freely propagate through galactic or local halo scales ( hundreds of kpc to few mpc ) and could also contribute to the extreme edges of cosmic ray spectrum and clustering ( see:@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the final energy flux of nucleons near the z peak resonance , @xmath88 over the corresponding electro - magnetic energy flux @xmath89 ratio is , as in tab.1 @xmath90 entrance , nearly @xmath91 .",
    "moreover if one considers at higher @xmath92 energies , the opening of ww , zz channels and the six pairs @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( and their anti - particle pairs ) t - channel interactions leading to highest energy leptons , with no nucleonic relics ( as @xmath96 ) , this additional injection favors the electro - magnetic flux @xmath89 over the corresponding nuclear one @xmath88 by a factor @xmath97 leading to @xmath98 .",
    "this ratio is valid at @xmath99 masses because the overall cross section variability is energy dependent . at center of mass energies above these values ,",
    "the @xmath100 decreases more because the dominant role of t - channel ( fig1 ) .",
    "we focus here on z , and ww , zz channels showering in hadrons for gzk events",
    ". the important role of uhe electron showering into tev radiation is discussed below .",
    "the minimal neutrino mass ( near 0.1 ev ) comparable with present super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino mass splitting are leading to an exciting scenario where ( more than one ) non degenerated z - resonances occur ( fargion et all.2001a , b @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "these scenario are summarized in ( fig .",
    "2 , in ref.@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ) , ( for nominal example @xmath101 = 0.1 ev ; @xmath102 = 0.05 ev ) . the twin neutrino mass inject a corresponding twin bump at highest energy .",
    "another limiting case of interest takes place when the light neutrino masses are both extreme , nearly at atmospheric ( sk , k2k ) and solar ( sno ) neutrino masses .",
    "this case is described in following fig.3 ( keeping care of the lower number density for lightest neutrino mass ) .",
    "the relic neutrino masses are assumed @xmath101 = 0.05 ev ; @xmath102 = 0.001 ev .",
    "the neutrino mass play a role also in defining its hot dark halo size and our peculiar position in such hdm halo .",
    "indeed for a heavy @xmath103 mass case hdm neutrino halo are mainly galactic and/or local , reflecting an isotropic or a diffused amplification toward nearby @xmath104 hdm halo . in the lighter case",
    "the hdm should include the local cluster up to virgo .",
    "to each size corresponds also a different role of uhecr arrival time .",
    "the larger the hdm size the longer the uhecr random - walk travel time and the longer the lag between doublets or triplets .",
    "the uhe neutrons by z - showering fits naturally the harder spectra observed in clustered events in agasa ( @xcite 2001 ) .",
    "the same uhecr neutrons may explain the quite short ( 2 - 3 years)@xcite lapse of time observed in agasa doublets .",
    "the same role of uhe neutron secondaries from z showering in hdm halo may also solve an emerging puzzle : the correlations of arrival directions of uhecrs found recently ( glushkov et all.@xcite 2001 ) in yakutsk data at energy @xmath105 toward the super galactic plane are to be compared with the compelling evidence of uhecrs events ( @xmath106 above gzk ) clustering toward well defined bl lacs at cosmic distances ( redshift @xmath107 ) ( tinyakov et tkachev @xcite 2001 ; gorbunov et al .",
    "@xcite 2002 ) .",
    "the question arise : where is the real uhecr sources location ? at super - galactic disk ( @xmath108 mpcs wide , within gzk range ) or at cosmic ( @xmath109 ) edges ?",
    "of course both results ( or just one of them ) maybe a statistical fluctuation .",
    "but both studies seem statistically significant ( 4.6 - 5 sigma ) and they seem in some obvious disagreement",
    ". there may be a possibility for @xmath110 new categories of uhecr sources .",
    "but it seem quite unnatural any propagation of direct nucleons because the uhecr from most distant blac sources are the harder .",
    "however our z - showering scenario offer a common simultaneous solution : ( 1 ) the relic neutrino masses define different hierarchical dark halos and arrival direction correlated to hot ( anisotropic ) relic neutrino halos .",
    "the real sources are at ( isotropic ) cosmic edges @xcite but their crossing along a wider anisotropic relic neutrino cloud enhance the interaction probability in the super galactic plane @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the nearest sg sources are weaker while the collimated bl lacs are harder : anyway both sources need a neutrino halo to induce the z - showering uhecrs .      as it is shown in table 1 and figures above",
    ", the electron ( positron ) energies by @xmath111 decays is around @xmath112 for an initial @xmath113 ( and @xmath114 ) .",
    "such electron pairs while not radiating efficiently in low extra - galactic magnetic fields they will be interacting with the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath115 ) leading to direct tev photons : @xmath116 the same uhe electrons will radiate less efficiently with extra- galactic magnetic field ( @xmath117 ) leading also to direct peak @xmath118 gev photons .",
    "the spectrum of these photons is characterized by a power of law @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the power law of the electron spectrum , and it is showed in figures above . as regards the prompt electrons at higher energy ( @xmath121 ) , in particular in the t - channels , their interactions with the extra - galactic field first and galactic magnetic fields later is source of another kind of synchrotron emission around tens of pev energies ( fargion et all @xcite 2001 ) .",
    "gammas at @xmath122 ev scatters onto low - energy photons from isotropic cosmic background ( @xmath123 ) converting their energy in electron pair . because the corresponding attenuation length due to the interactions with the microwave background is around ten kpc , the extension of the halo plays a fundamental role in order to make this mechanism efficient or not . as is shown in figures above the contribution to tens of pev gamma signals by z ( or w ) hadronic decay , could be compatible with actual experimental limits fixed by casa - mia detector on such a range of energies . considering a halo extension @xmath124 ,",
    "the secondary electron pair creation becomes efficient , leading to a suppression of the tens of pev signal .",
    "so electrons at @xmath125 loose again energy through additional synchrotron radiation with maximum @xmath126 around @xmath127 anyway this signal is not able to pollute sensibly the mev - gev while its relevance is striking by a pile up signal at tevs . in this frame",
    "let us remind that gamma rays with energies up to @xmath128 tev have been observed by terrestrial detector only by nearby sources like mrk 501 ( z @xmath129 ) or very recently by mrk @xmath130 ( z @xmath131 ) .",
    "more recent evidences of tens tevs from ( three times more ) distant blazar 1es1426 + 428 ( z @xmath132 ) make even more dramatic the ir - tev cut - off .",
    "this is puzzling because the extra - galactic tev spectrum should be , in principle , significantly suppressed by the @xmath2-rays interactions with the extra - galactic infrared background , leading to electron pair production and tevs cut - off .",
    "the recent calibration and determination of the infrared background by dirbe and firas on cobe have inferred severe constrains on tev propagation . indeed , as noticed by kifune ( @xcite 1997 ) , and protheroe and meyer @xcite we may face a severe infrared background - tev gamma ray crisis .",
    "this crisis imply a distance cut - off , incidentally , comparable to the gzk one . so our present z - showering scenario ( @xcite ) may easily solve also the ir - tev cut off .",
    "let us remind also an additional evidence for ir - tev cut - off is related to the possible discover of tens of tev counterparts of batse grb970417 , observed by milagrito(r .",

    "it should be kept in mind also that uptaus and in particular hortaus are showering at very low densities and their geometrical opening angle ( here assumed at @xmath158 ) is not in general conical ( like down - ward showers ) but they are more in a thin fan - like shape ( like the observed @xmath159 shaped horizontal air - showers ) .",
    "the fan shape is opened by the terrestrial magnetic field bending .",
    "these uptaus - hortaus duration time is also much longer than common down - ward showers because their showering occurs at much lower air density : from micro ( uptaus from mountains ) to millisecond ( uptaus and hortaus from satellites ) long flashes .",
    "indeed the gro observed terrestrial gamma flashes , possibly correlated with the uptaus @xcite show the millisecond duration times . in order to estimate the rate and the fluence for of uptaus and hortaus one has to estimate the observable mass , facing a complex chain of questions , leading for each height @xmath153 , to an effective observable surface and volume from where",
    "uptaus and hortaus might be originated @xcite . from this effective volume",
    "it is easy to estimate the observable rates , assuming a given incoming uhe @xmath1 flux model for galactic or extragalactic sources .",
    "here we shall only refer to the masses estimate , unrelated to any uhe @xmath1 flux models .",
    "these steps are linking simple terrestrial spherical geometry and its different geological composition , high energy neutrino physics and uhe @xmath135 interactions , the same uhe @xmath135 decay in flight and its air - showering physics at different quota within terrestrial air density @xcite . detector physics threshold and background noises ,",
    "signal rates have been kept in mind @xcite , but they will be discussed and explained in forthcoming papers .",
    "let us therefore define , list and estimate below the sequence of the key variables whose dependence ( shown below or derived in appendices ) leads to the desired hortaus volumes ( useful to estimate the uhe @xmath1 prediction rates ) summirized in a last table and in conclusions .",
    "let us now show the main functions whose interdependence with the observer altitude lead to estimate the uptaus and hortaus equivalent detection surfaces , volumes and masses @xcite.the horizontal distance @xmath160 toward the horizons : @xmath161 the corresponding horizontal edge angle @xmath162 : @xmath163(approximations here and below hold for height@xmath164 . )",

    "more precisely at low quota ( @xmath170 : @xmath171 km ) : @xmath172 \\cdot e^{\\frac{h_1}{h_o}}.$ ] so we may neglect the distance of the final shower respect to the longest horizons ones .",
    "however at high altitude ( @xmath173 ) this is no longer the case .",
