    "let us make a few comments on this result .",
    "we first recall the well - known sequence of implications as well as the @xmath5 lattices that satisfy them : @xmath6 in the case of _ bounded degree _ planar graphs the liouville property is equivalent to recurrence of the simple random walk , see @xcite ( as in the case of non - compact planar riemannian surfaces ) .",
    "if we drop the bounded degree assumption , it is easy to construct transient planar graphs which are liouville : for example , start with a half line @xmath7 and place @xmath8 parallel edges between @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 . yet",
    "this graph clearly has the intersection property .",
    "our result thus becomes interesting in the case of liouville planar graphs of unbounded degree .",
    "such graphs arise for example as distributional limits of finite random planar graphs , a topic that has attracted a lot of research recently @xcite .",
    "the strategy of the proof is the following .",
    "we consider three independent simple random walk trajectories , and argue that if each two of them intersect only finitely many times , then they divide our planar graph into three regions ( fig.[separation ] ) .",
    "this allows us to talk about the probability for random walk to eventually stay in one of these regions , which we use to construct a non - constant bounded harmonic function , contradicting our liouvilleness assumption .",
    "fix @xmath0 a connected planar multi - graph and suppose that @xmath1 has the liouville property . first note that if @xmath1 is recurrent then it has the intersection property and we thus suppose henceforth that @xmath1 is transient .",
    "+ denote by @xmath12 the law of a simple random walk @xmath13 started from @xmath3 in @xmath1 .",
    "we write @xmath14 for the trajectory of @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 is a set of vertices in @xmath1 define for any @xmath17 @xmath18 it is clear that @xmath19 is harmonic ( bounded ) and is thus constant since @xmath1 is liouville .",
    "we write @xmath20 for the common value @xmath21 @xmath22 .",

    "let us suppose by contradiction that we are in the latter case .",
    "+ we now make use of the planarity and consider a proper embedding is liouville , it has precisely one transient end @xmath41 and it is possible to embed @xmath1 in @xmath42 so that no ray in @xmath41 has an accumulation point in @xmath43 , which always exists @xcite . ] of @xmath1 in @xmath43",
    ". let us consider three independent simple random walk trajectories @xmath44 and @xmath45 started from some @xmath17 .",
    "since almost surely these paths intersect each - other finitely often a.s . , they distinguish , using the planarity , three regions in ( the embedding of ) @xmath1 called @xmath46 and @xmath47 as depicted in the figure below .",
    "formally , the region @xmath48 is defined as the set of all vertices @xmath49 such that for all @xmath9 large enough , if @xmath29 is a path linking @xmath4 to @xmath50 in @xmath1 then @xmath29 must intersect @xmath51 . the regions @xmath52 and @xmath47",

    "we then define @xmath55 note that @xmath56 is a random function and that for every @xmath57 it is ( bounded ) harmonic over @xmath1 and thus constant by the liouville property of @xmath1 .",

    "we deduce that the probability inside the expectation of the right - hand side of the last display goes to @xmath27 as @xmath65 .",

    "e.g. , a natural extension of the collection of all planar graphs is the collection of all graphs with an excluded minor .",
    "fix a finite graph @xmath69 .",
    "it is reasonable to guess that the statement of theorem [ main ] still holds if we replace the planarity assumption by the hypothesis that @xmath1 does not have @xmath69 as a minor .",
    "indeed , many theorems on planar graphs generalize to excluded minor graphs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is even more interesting to show that bounded degree transient excluded minor graphs admit non - constant bounded harmonic functions thus extending @xcite .",
    "another generalization of planarity is sphere - packability , see @xcite .",
    "we _ ask _ whether a liouville sphere - packable graph in @xmath70 should admit the intersection property ?",

    "+ for bounded degree planar graphs , the liouville property is quasi - isometry invariant since transience is .",
    "an example in @xcite shows that liouville property and almost sure intersection of simple random walks are not quasi - isometry invariants : there exist two graphs @xmath82 and @xmath83 that are quasi - isometric such that @xmath82 has the intersection property ( hence liouville ) whereas @xmath83 is non liouville and two independent simple random walk trajectories started from two different points in @xmath83 have a probability strictly in between @xmath27 and @xmath28 of having an infinite intersection .",
    "however it is possible to modify and iterate the construction of @xcite in such a way that the last probability is actually @xmath27 .",
    "a concept related to liouvilleness is the _ ( dirichlet ) energy _ of a harmonic function @xmath84 , defined by @xmath85 where the sum ranges over all neighbors @xmath86 of the graph .",
    "for example , it is known that if a graph admits a non - constant harmonic function of finite energy then it is not liouville @xcite , but the converse is in general not true .",
