    "studying correlation functions in many - body systems has been considered one of the main topics in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics for many years .",
    "although , for a long - time the main quantities of interest were the correlation functions of local observables the recent interest in calculating non - local quantities , especially the entanglement entropy , has made significant changes .",
    "one of the main reasons for this interest ( at least in @xmath4 dimensional critical systems ) is that by calculating some of the non - local observables one can derive the central charge of the system without referring to the velocity of sound , for the case of entanglement entropy see @xcite .",
    "another non - local quantity which has been studied for many years with bethe ansatz techniques and some other methods is emptiness formation probability @xcite . in the case of spin chains ,",
    "it is the probability of finding a sequence of up spins in the system ( note that almost all of the studies in this regard concentrate on the @xmath0 bases ) .",
    "these studies show that this probability , with respect to the sequence size , decreases like a gaussian in the case of systems with @xmath5 symmetry @xcite and exponentially in other cases @xcite . in the critical cases , the gaussian and exponential",
    "are accompanied with a power - law decay with a universal exponent . in a recent development",
    "@xcite it was shown that for those critical systems without @xmath5 symmetry this universal exponent is dependent on the central charge of the system .",
    "the argument is based on connecting the configuration of all spins up to some sort of boundary conformal field theory .",
    "one should notice that the argument works just for those bases that can be connected to boundary conformal field theory .",
    "in an apparently connected studies recently many authors investigated the shannon information of quantum systems in different systems @xcite .",
    "the shannon information is defined as follows : consider the normalized ground state eigenfunction of a quantum spin chain hamiltonian @xmath6 , expressed in a particular local bases @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the eigenvalues of some local operators defined on the lattice sites .",
    "the shannon entropy is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability of finding the system in the particular configuration given by @xmath11 .",
    "as it is quite clear this quantity is bases dependent and to calculate it one needs in principle to know the probability of occurrence of all the configurations .",
    "the number of all configurations increases exponentially with the size of the system and that makes analytical and numerical calculations of this quantity quite difficult .",
    "note that the emptiness formation probability is just one of the whole possible configurations .",
    "the shannon information of the system changes like a volume law with respect to the size of the system so in principle one does not expect to extract any universal information by studying the leading term .",
    "the universal quantities should come from the subleading terms . to study subleading terms , it is useful to define yet another quantity called shannon mutual information . by considering local bases it is always possible to decompose the configurations as a combination of the configurations inside and outside of a subregion @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "then one can define the marginal probabilities as @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the subregion @xmath12 and its complement @xmath16 .",
    "then the shannon mutual information is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the shannon informations of the subregions @xmath12 and @xmath16 . from now on instead of using @xmath20 we will use just @xmath21 . since in the above quantity the volume part of the shannon entropy disappears shannon mutual information provides a useful technique to study the subleading terms .",
    "note that one can similarly define the above quantity also for two regions @xmath12 and @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 that are not necessarily complement of each other .",
    "the shannon mutual information has been studied in many classical @xcite and quantum systems @xcite .",
    "numerical studies on variety of different periodic quantum critical spin chains show that for particular bases ( so called conformal bases ) we have @xcite @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath3 are the total size and subsystem size respectively and @xmath26 is very close to @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the central charge of the system .",
    "note that if one takes an arbitrary base ( non - conformal bases ) the coefficient @xmath26 is nothing to do with the central charge .",
    "it is worth mentioning that based on @xcite the conformal bases are those bases that can be connected to some sort of boundary conformal field theory in the sense of @xcite .",
    "for example in the transverse field ising model the @xmath29 and @xmath0 bases are the conformal bases .",
    "note that if one considers the shannon information of the subsystem we will have @xmath30 $ ] . since to extract the shannon information one needs to use all the probabilities the only way to consider all of them in the numerical calculations is exact diagonalization .",
    "this makes the numerical calculation for large sizes very difficult .",
    "the results of the articles @xcite are all for periodic systems with @xmath31 whenever there are spin one - half system and smaller sizes for systems with bigger spins . in a recent work @xcite",
    "the author was able to consider an infinite system and study the shannon information of the subsystem up to the size @xmath32 .",
    "it was concluded that for the @xmath1 chain @xmath26 is @xmath27 with @xmath33 but for the ising model although it is very close to @xmath27 with @xmath34 the results are suggesting that probably @xmath26 is not exactly connected to the central charge .",
    "notice that all of the above calculations are done by considering periodic boundary conditions for the connected regions @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is not clear how the equation ( [ mutual ] ) might change if one considers open boundary conditions .",
    "finally it is worth mentioning that some of the the above results have recently been extended to disconnected regions in @xcite .    motivated by the studies of emptiness formation probability and shannon information of the subsystem we study here some related quantities .",
    "first of all , as it is natural one might be interested in studying the scaling limit of some other configurations with respect to the size of the subsystem .",
    "for example , consider an antiferromagnetic configuration in the ising model or any other configuration with pattern .",
    "it is very important to know that these configurations are also flowing to some sort of boundary conformal field theory or not .",
    "this study will clearly also help to understand the nature of the shannon mutual information .",
    "in addition , this kind of studies also are very useful in the calculations of post - measurement entanglement entropy and localizable entanglement entropy @xcite . having the above motivations in mind , we study formation probabilities , shannon information and their evolution after a quantum quench in the quantum @xmath35 chain in the @xmath0 bases .    the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will first define our system of interest , i.e. @xmath35 chain and then we will provide a method to calculate the probability of any configuration in the free fermionic systems . in section three we will list all the known analytical results regarding emptiness formation probability for infinite systems and also finite systems with periodic and open boundary conditions .",
    "explicit distinguishment is made between critical ising model and @xmath1 chain with @xmath5 symmetry . in section iv",
    ", we will define many different configurations with specially defined pattern and calculate their corresponding probabilities numerically . here again , we discuss ising and @xmath1 universalities separately for infinite systems and for the systems with boundary .",
    "we also discuss configurations that do not have any pattern . in section",
    "v , we study the shannon information in the transverse field critical ising model and also critical @xmath1 chain",
    ". we will classify the configurations based on their magnetization and show that in principle just a small part of the configurations can have a finite contribution to shannon information in the scaling limit .",
    "section vi is devoted to the evolution of formation probabilities and shannon information after a quantum quench .",
    "we prepare the system in a particular state and then we let it evolve with another hamiltonian and study the time evolution of the formation probabilities and especially shannon information . finally , the last section is about our conclusions and possible future works .",
    "in this section , we first define the system of interest and after that using the reduced density matrix of this system we will find a very efficient method to calculate formation probabilities for systems that can be mapped to free fermions .",

    "however , the boundary conditions on the boundary of strip can be different from the boundary condition on the slit , consequently , one needs to consider boundary changing operator on the point where the boundary condition changes .",
    "however , in general it is not clear which configurations lead to different boundary conditions on the slit and on the boundary of the strip .",
    "our numerical results indeed give a hint that depending on the bahavior of the parity of the number of down spins in a configuration the conformal boundary condition on the slit can be different . in the next two subsections",

    "however , numerically it is very simple to check the formula for many configurations that have a small deviation from the crystal states .",

    "we first performed the calculations for semi - infinite open chain and fitted the results to ( [ main formula1 ] ) and extracted the @xmath26 .",
    "the coefficient of the logarithm not only depends on the rank of the configuration but also to the configuration itself .",
    "it also changes with @xmath157 .",
    "we were not able to find any universal feature in this case .",
    "the above results suggest that most probably all of the crystal configurations with @xmath153 in the periodic boundary condition flow to a boundary conformal field theory . in the language of luttinger liquid",
    ", the corresponding boundary condition should be the dirichlet boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the case of the open boundary condition is intriguing and we leave it as an open problem .",
    "in this section , we study shannon information of a subsystem in transverse - field ising model and @xmath1 chain .",
    "for both models , the shannon information is already calculated in @xcite up to the size @xmath32 which it seems to be the current limit for classical computers .",
    "the reason that we are interested in revisiting this quantity is to have a more detailed study of the contribution of different configurations .",
    "this will give an interesting insight regarding the possible scaling limit for this quantity .",
    "in the last section , we studied many different configurations in the critical ising model and we found that all of them follow @xmath159 with @xmath34 .",
    "the natural expectation is that if we plug this formula in the definition of the shannon information we get @xmath160 where the dots are the subleading terms .",
    "the above formula is consistent with @xcite .",
    "however , one should be careful that although there are a lot of crystal configurations ( polynomial number of them ) and `` close '' to crystal configurations that are connected to the central charge it is absolutely not clear what is going to happen in the scaling limit .",
    "for example we repeated the calculations of @xcite and realized that extraction of the coefficient of the @xmath156 in the above equation is indeed very difficult , see appendix . here",
    "we show where one should look for the most important configurations .",
    "after a bit of inspection and numerical check , one can see that the configuration with the highest probability is the @xmath77 .",
    "although the proof of the above statment does nt look straightforward one can understand it qualitatively by starting from the ground state of the ising model with @xmath161 and approaching to the critical point @xmath162 .",
    "the ground state of the ising model with @xmath161 is made of a configuration with all spins up .",
    "when we decrease the transverse magnetic field the other configurations start to appear in the ground state .",
    "although the amplitude of the configuration with all spins up decreases by decreasing @xmath46 it still remains always bigger than the other configurations .",
    "another way to look at this phenomena is by looking at the variation of the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath163 for different configurations @xmath89 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath164 is minimum for the configuration @xmath89 with all spins up .",
    "this simply means that most probably when one construct the ground state of the ising model using the variational techniques this configuration playes the most important role .",
    "the least important configuration is @xmath165 with the lowest probability .",
    "this can also be understood with the same heuristic argument as above . for every rank @xmath73 of the minors ,",
    "as we discussed , we have @xmath71 number of configurations which means that for every @xmath122 for large @xmath3 we have @xmath166 with @xmath167 number of configurations .",
    "it is obvious that the number of configurations in every rank should be high enough to compensate the exponential decrease of probabilities .",
    "we realized that in every rank the configurations @xmath134 has the lowest probabilities .",
    "one can again understand this fact using the variational argument . in this case",
    "it is much better to make first the canonical transformation : @xmath168 and @xmath169 in the hamiltonian of the crtical ising model",
    ". then one can simply argue that @xmath164 is big if there are a lot of domain walls , i.e. @xmath170 in the system which is the case for the configurations @xmath134 .",
    "other important configurations are the configurations which divide the subsystem to two connected regions with in one part all the spins are up and in the other part all the spins are down .",
    "these configurations are interesting because they have the biggest probabilities among all the configurations corresponding to their minor rank . note that in this case we have just one domain wall .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the probability of all of these configurations decay exponentially with the following coefficient @xmath86 : @xmath171 where @xmath89 is the catalan constant . in the two extreme points ,",
    "we recover the previous results .",
    "we also checked the validity of the above formula numerically . having the biggest and smallest probabilities for every rank , we can now easily read the most important ranks . in figure  6",
    "we depicted the @xmath172 and @xmath173 for different configurations .",
    "we also depicted the graph of the number of configurations in every rank .",
    "the figure clearly show that the configurations with @xmath174 can not have any significant contribution in the scaling limit because the number of configurations is not enough to compensate the exponential decay of the probabilities .",
    "a similar story seems to be valid also for the values of @xmath122 close to zero .",
    "the reason is that the number of configurations with small @xmath122 is such low that can not compensate exponential decay of the probabilities in this region to have a significant contribution in the shannon information .",
    "just the region between the points that the two lines cut each other will most likely survive in the scaling limit .",
    "[ htbp ! ] [ fig6 ]    the numerical results indeed prove our expectation . in figure  7",
    "we depicted the contribution of every rank @xmath175 in shannon information for two different sizes .",
    "as it is quite clear the most important contributions come from @xmath176 .",
    "the contribution of the configurations with @xmath174 is exponentially small .",
    "this means that ignoring a lot of configurations will produce a very small amount of error in the final result of shannon information . to quantify this argument we calculated the amount of error in the evaluation of the shannon information if we just keep the configurations with ranks up to @xmath177 .",
    "suppose @xmath178 is the contribution of the configurations with all ranks equal or smaller than @xmath177 .",
    "then the error of truncation can be calculated by @xmath179 .",
    "interestingly we found that the logarithm of the error function is a linear function of @xmath3 , see figure  8 .",
    "in other words @xmath180 where @xmath181 is equal to zero and infinity for @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively .",
    "@xmath181 for the other values are shown in the inset of the figure  8 .",
    "the above formula shows that one can calculate shannon information with a controllable accuracy by ignoring non - important configurations .",
    "although the above truncation method help to calculate the shannon information with good accuracy ( especially the coefficient of the linear term @xmath86 ) it is still not good enough to calculate the coefficient of the logarithm with controllable precision .    [ hthp ! ] [ fig7 ]    [ hthp ! ] [ fig8 ]      the shannon information of the subsystem in the xx - chain is already discussed in @xcite and based on numerical results it is concluded that the equation ( [ linear ] ) is valid with @xmath154 which is consistent with the conjecture in @xcite .",
    "here we just comment on the contribution of different ranks which shows very different behavior from the transverse field ising chain case .",
    "first of all , as we discussed in the previous section when the external field is zero the only configurations that decay exponentially are those that respect the half filling structure of the total system . the rest of the configurations scale like a gaussian which simply indicates that their contribution is very small in the shannon information .",
    "this is simply because the number of these configurations scale just exponentially .",
    "based on this simple fact one can anticipate that the only configurations that can survive in the scaling limit are those with @xmath128 .",
    "numerical results depicted in the figure  9 indeed support this idea .",
    "although the @xmath128 is only one among @xmath3 possible minor ranks the number of configurations with this rank is highest with respect to the others which can be one of the reasons that one can obtain a good estimate for the coefficient of the logarithm in ( [ linear ] ) with relatively modest sizes .    [ hthp ! ] [ fig9 ]",
    "inspired by experimental motivations , the field of quantum non - equilibrium systems has enjoyed a huge boost in the recent decade@xcite .",
    "one of the interesting directions in this field is the study of information propagation after quantum quench , see for example @xcite .",
    "based on semiclassical arguments and also using lieb - robinson bound it is shown @xcite that in one dimensional integrable system one can understand the evolution of entanglement entropy of a subsystem based on quasi - particle picture @xcite . the argument is as follows : after the quench , there is an extensive excess in energy which appears as quasiparticles that propagate in time .",
    "the quasi - particles emitted from nearby points are entangled and they are responsible for the linear increase of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem with respect to the rest . in this section ,",
    "we first study the time evolution of formation probabilities and subsequently shannon and mutual information after a quantum quench .",
    "one can consider this section as a complement to the other studies of information propagation after quantum quench . to keep the discussion as simple as possible",
    ", we will concentrate on the most simple case of xx - chain or free fermions .",
    "following @xcite consider the hamiltonian @xmath184    [ hthp ! ] [ fig10 ]    the time evolution of the correlation functions in the half filling are given as @xmath185 where , @xmath186 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "here we consider the dimerized initial conditions with @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the dimerized nature of the initial state will help later to consider different possibilities for the initial shannon mutual information .",
    "then at time zero we change the hamiltonian to @xmath189 and let it evolve . the time evolution of the correlation matrix is given by @xcite    @xmath190    [ hthp ! ] [ fig11 ]    to calculate the time evolution of the probability of different configurations one just needs to use the above formula in ( [ formation probability xx ] ) .",
    "the results for few configurations are shown in the figure  10 .",
    "of course since the sum of all the probabilities should be equal to one some of the probabilities increase with time and some decrease .",
    "all the probabilities change rapidly up to time @xmath191 and after that saturate .",
    "one can also simply calculate the evolution of the shannon information with the tools of previous sections . in figure  11",
    "we depicted the evolution of shannon information of a subsystem with respect to the time @xmath192 .",
    "the numerical results show an increase in the shannon information up to time @xmath191 and then saturation .",
    "this is similar to what we usually have in the study of the time evolution of von neumann entanglement entropy after quantum quench @xcite .",
    "however , one should be careful that in contrast to the von neumann entropy the shannon information of the subsystem is not a measure of correlation between the two subsystems .",
    "in addition , the increase in the shannon information of the subsystem is not linear as the evolution of the von neumann entanglement entropy .",
    "our numerical results indicate that apart from a small regime at the beginning the shannon information increases as @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath45 and @xmath195 are positive @xmath3 independent quantities .",
    "[ hthp ! ] [ fig12 ]    [ hthp ! ] [ fig13 ]    to study the time evolution of correlations , it is much better to study another quantity , shannon mutual information of two subsystems . to investigate this quantity",
    "we first studied the time evolution of shannon mutual information of a couple of dimers located far from each other .",
    "the results depicted in the figure  12 show that the shannon mutual information of the dimers are zero up to time @xmath196 and after that increases rapidly and then again decays slowly .",
    "this picture is consistent with the quasiparticle picture .",
    "the two regions are not correlated up to time that the quasiparticles emitted from the middle point reach each dimer@xcite .",
    "however , the similarity between the evolution of the von neumann entropy and mutual shannon information ends here . to elaborate on",
    "that we consider the mutual information of two adjacent regions with sizes @xmath197 .",
    "because of the dimerized nature of the initial state there are two possibilities for choosing the subsystems : at time zero at the boundary between the two subsystems there can be a dimer or not . in the first case at time zero",
    "the shannon mutual information between the two subsystems is not zero but in the second case it is zero . in the second case",
    "naturally one expects an overall increase in the mutual information but in the first case a priory it is not clear that the mutual information should increase or decrease . in the figure  13",
    "we have depicted the results of the numerics for the two adjacent subsystems for different sizes .",
    "the numerical results show that for the uncorrelated initial conditions the shannon mutual information first increases rapidly and then it decays and finally saturates at time @xmath2 . in the correlated case",
    ", we have overall decay in the mutual information and finally the saturation again at time @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior is very different from the quantum mutual information of the same regions which for the considered initial states first increases linearly and then saturates at time @xmath2 .",
    "the interesting phenomena is that after a short initial regime that the shannon mutual information is initial state dependent the system enters to a regime that this quantity is completely independent of initial state and it decreases `` almost '' linearly and then saturates .",
    "this can be also easily seen from the equation ( [ evolution ] ) , where we can simply drive @xmath198 the saturation regime is independent of the size of the subsystem , this is simply because in the equlibrium regime the shannon mutual information follows the area - law @xcite and so it is independent of the volume of the subsystems .",
    "in this paper , we employed grassmann numbers to write the probability of occurrence of different configurations in free fermion systems with respect to the minors of a particular matrix .",
    "the formula gives a very efficient method to study the scaling properties of logarithmic formation probabilities in the critical xy - chain .",
    "in particular , we showed that the logarithmic formation probabilities of crystal configurations are given by the cft formulas for the critical transverse field ising model .",
    "this is checked by studying the probabilities in the infinite and finite ( periodic and open boundary conditions ) chain . in the case of critical xx - chain which has a @xmath5 symmetry just the configurations with",
    "@xmath153 follow the cft formulas .",
    "the rest of the configurations decay like a gaussian and do not show much universal behavior .",
    "we also studied the shannon information of a subsystem in the transverse field ising model and xx - chain .",
    "in particular , for the ising model , we showed that in the scaling limit just the configurations with a high number of up spins contribute to the scaling of the shannon information . in principle , if one considers all the configurations , with our method one can not calculate the shannon information with classical computers for sizes bigger than @xmath32 in a reasonable time .",
    "however , if one admits a controllable error in the calculation of shannon information it is possible to hire the results of section v to go to higher sizes .",
    "it would be very nice to extend this aspect of our calculations further to calculate the universal quantities in the shannon information with higher accuracy .",
    "for example , one interesting direction can be finding an explicit formula for the sum of different powers of principal minors of a matrix .",
    "this kind of formulas can be very useful to calculate analytically or numerically the rnyi entropy of the subsystem .",
    "finally , we also studied the evolution of formation probabilities after quantum quench in free fermion system . in this case , we prepared the system in the dimer configuration and then we let it evolve with homogeneous hamiltonian .",
    "the evolution of shannon information of a susbsytem shows a very similar behavior as the evolution of entanglement entropy after a quantum quench .",
    "especially our calculations show that the saturation of the shannon information of the subsystem occurs at the same time as the entanglement entropy .",
    "this is probably not surprising because the @xmath199 is also the time that the reduced density operator saturates .",
    "it will be very nice to extend our calculations in few other directions .",
    "one direction can be investigating the evolution of mutual information after local quantum quenches as it is done extensively in the studies of the entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "the other interesting direction can be calculating the same quantities in other bases , especially those bases that do not have any direct connection to cft .",

    "the data regarding shannon information for a subsystem with length @xmath3 up to @xmath200 is listed in the table a1 .",
    "having the data , we checked many different functions with different parameters to study the coefficient of the logarithm . needless to say",
    "increasing the possible parameters can make a difference in the final result . in @xcite",
    "the results fitted to @xmath201 show that the best value is @xmath202 .",
    "this can be also checked using the data provided in the table a1 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one can also get reasonable results using the data up to @xmath32 for some formation probabilities ( not all ) if we consider extra terms @xmath203 in the fitting procedure .",
    "although we found that the equation ( [ stephan ] ) is the most stable fit with the least standard deviation based on our results in the main text we found it is hard to exclude the term @xmath91 because it is present in all the configurations studied there .",
    "if one includes this term and does not add the terms @xmath203 the @xmath26 coefficient will be @xmath204 .",
    "if one keeps all the terms @xmath203 the result will be @xmath202 .",
