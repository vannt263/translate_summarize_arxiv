    "the proximity effect between a superconductor and a normal metal has been thoroughly investigated using various techniques : ginzburg - landau theory @xcite , quasi - classical green function methods @xcite , gorkov equation methods @xcite , and tight - binding bdg methods @xcite . from an experimental point of view ,",
    "one of the better suited experiments is the measurement of the josephson critical current in weak links @xcite .    in a recent experiment",
    "@xcite an unusually large proximity effect is reported , and the authors argue that it can not be explained by the conventional proximity effect . the system used in the experiment is a c - axis oriented one . the c - axis",
    "josephson critical current is measured through a thin film system made of doped lco with @xmath2k , sandwiched between optimally doped lsco with @xmath3k .",
    "the thin film is considered to be in the clean limit and because of the epitaxial growth of the films the transmission at the interfaces is close to unity and interface roughness is on the order of the lattice constant . in a particular setup ,",
    "the lco thin film used had a thickness of @xmath4 .",
    "fitting the critical current around @xmath5 the authors extract a coherence length in the lco film which is two orders of magnitude larger than expected . because of this discrepancy and the observation of non - zero critical current for @xmath6k",
    "the authors reported this effect to be a  giant proximity effect \" .",
    "although the josephson junction has been thoroughly investigated in the past for both s - wave @xcite and d - wave symmetries @xcite , we feel that the calculation of the cooper pair leaking distance in the case of clean limit and superconducting weak links needs further investigation .",
    "we are interested to observe if the leaking distance will be influenced by the finite critical temperature of the weak superconductor .",
    "we propose the use of the numerical solutions of the bdg equations in a tight binding formulation in order to obtain a direct calculation of the coherence length and of the josephson critical current . in the clean limit",
    "the bdg equations are particularly easy to solve because impurity averaging is not required .",
    "this method is complementary to the quasi - classical methods used in the dirty limit , namely the usadel equations @xcite .    for coherent transport in the c - axis direction ,",
    "the properties of the josephson current for d - wave superconductors will be similar to the properties of the current for s - wave superconductors .",
    "for planar interfaces , with @xmath7 the direction perpendicular to the interfaces , the d - wave order parameter will have no @xmath8 dependence , @xmath9 and therefore will have properties similar to a superconductor with s - wave symmetry .",
    "when fourier transforming the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions , and considering an effective 1d problem in the @xmath7 direction , the d - wave order parameter will be due to an effective on - site interaction within each ab - plane .",
    "we will calculate the josephson current in the c - axis direction for a 3d d - wave superconductor .",
    "we will also show calculations of the josephson critical current and the cooper pair leaking distance for a 2d s - wave superconductor and for the 100 interface of a 2d d - wave superconductor .",
    "the giant proximity effect is observed in underdoped cuprates , for temperatures @xmath12 for which the middle layer is considered to be in the pseudo - gap state .",
    "previous theoretical investigations of the giant proximity effect @xcite considered the n layer to be comprised of pockets of superconductivity . in a recent theoretical study @xcite ,",
    "interstitial oxygen dopants are considered to modify locally the pairing interactions .",
    "the disordered dopants are enhancing the pairing interactions , thus increasing the size of the local gap .",
    "this was observed in recent stm experiments @xcite in bscco , which showed that the regions of enhanced superconductivity are correlated with the positions of the interstitial oxygen atoms . because of the proximity effect , the superconducting pockets will be coupled and current will flow through percolating paths .",
    "the presence of these pockets will effectively shorten the length of the weak link and the strong external superconductors will be coupled for values of the effective length comparable with the leaking distance .",
    "the modification of the leaking distance due to the finite value of @xmath5 will have an important influence on the effective length .",
    "considering equally spaced areas of strong superconductivity with critical temperature @xmath0 embedded in the weak superconductor with @xmath5 we will calculate the critical josephson current and find its dependence on the length of the weak link and on the volume of the embedded superconducting pockets .",
    "if one considers disordered regions of strong superconductivity in the @xmath13 planes of a high - t@xmath14 superconductor , then the distance between two pockets from different @xmath15 planes will be normally distributed .",
    "the equally spaced pockets scenario should be the one that gives maximal josephson current and will give insight about the influence of these pockets on the current .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will present our method .",
    "while the bdg procedure on a lattice is now well known , we nonetheless include some details , as some  standard \" approximations are included for clarity",
    ". the treatment of infinite surfaces will be outlined . in the third section",
    "we apply the bdg equations to a tri - layer system and show results of the calculation of the order parameter , the leaking distance and the dc josephson current .",
    "both the cases of s - wave and d - wave symmetries of the superconducting order parameters are considered .",
    "we find that the proximity effect can be considerably enhanced at temperatures close to ( but above ) the critical temperature of the weak superconductor .",
    "the presence of randomly distributed pockets of superconductivity in n enhances dramatically the josephson critical current and leads to a `` giant proximity effect '' .",
    "in order to describe the superconducting state we use the tight binding extended hubbard hamiltonian :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude which describes the kinetic energy , @xmath18 is the chemical potential used to fix the filling of the system , @xmath19 is the on - site interaction , @xmath20 is the nearest neighbor interaction and @xmath21 is the density operator at site @xmath22 corresponding to spin @xmath23 .",
    "the properties of this hamiltonian have been studied previously @xcite ; it should be viewed as an effective hamiltonian with which one can describe s - wave and d - wave symmetries of the superconducting order parameter . for an s - wave superconductor we choose an attractive on - site interaction @xmath24 and no nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath25 , while for a d - wave superconductor we set the nearest neighbor interaction to be attractive @xmath26 and the on - site interaction to vanish or be repulsive .",
    "the interaction parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dependent on position , breaking translational invariance .",
    "this will allow us to describe interfaces between different types of materials .    using the hartree - fock mean field decomposition",
    "this hamiltonian can be transformed into a one - particle mean - field hamiltonian :    @xmath27    for planar junctions , infinite surfaces can be considered and therefore translational invariance in the direction parallel to the surface is recovered . by doing a fourier transform of the hamiltonian in the direction parallel to the surface we only have to solve one - dimensional inhomogeneous problems . for any point in k",
    "- space the problem becomes a one - dimensional inhomogeneous problem . in the case of a 2d superconductor with an infinite surface along the @xmath11 direction",
    "the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath28 c_{i\\sigma}^{k_y\\dagger } c_{j\\sigma}^{k_y } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{k_y}\\sum_{i } [ \\delta_i+2\\delta_{i}^{||}cos(k_ya)]c_{i{\\uparrow}}^{k_y\\dagger } c_{i{\\downarrow}}^{k_y\\dagger } + h.c .",

    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the hopping amplitude and pair potential in the direction perpendicular to the surface and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the hopping amplitude and the pair potential in the direction parallel to the surface .",
    "the mean - field order parameters are to be calculated self - consistently : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the s - wave order parameter , @xmath37 is the d - wave order parameter of a link in the direction parallel to the surface and @xmath38 is the d - wave order parameter of a link in the direction parallel to the surface .    in the 3d c - axis geometry ,",
    "the surface is considered to be in the @xmath39 plane .",

    "@xmath42 is the on - site s - wave order parameter while @xmath34 is the d - wave order parameter which has components only in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions .",
    "we follow the standard procedure @xcite of introducing a canonical transformation of the electron operators : @xmath43 this transformation will diagonalize the hamiltonian and one obtains the bdg equations for each pair of momentum vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 : @xmath46 these equations describe the quasi - particle states in inhomogeneous superconductors .",
    "the bdg equations are equivalent to an eigenvalue problem with parameters that require self - consistent calculation .",
    "we start with an initial guess for the order parameter profile and we diagonalize the resulting hamiltonian . in our infinite - surface setup , we need to diagonalize a one - dimensional hamiltonian for every point in momentum space . using the self - consistency equations ( 4)-(6 ) we recalculate the order parameter profile .",
    "the solution is obtained when the difference in the order parameters between two steps is smaller than a desired accuracy .",
    "the self - consistent calculation of the order parameter ensures that the order parameter in the  normal metal \" region has knowledge about the pair potential in this layer . if the initial guess is a step function , i.e. the order parameter in the middle region is zero , after one iteration the pair amplitude will become non - zero because of the proximity effect . in the case",
    "@xmath47 , the order parameter will remain zero : @xmath48 , while for the case @xmath49 the new order parameter has a finite value throughout the layer .",
    "if we were to fix the order parameter in the superconducting regions ( we do not ) , the @xmath50 solution would need only one iteration to converge .",
    "the bdg formalism allows us to calculate the dc current in the absence of applied voltages . in the tight - binding formulation",
    "the current operator is : @xmath51 the expectation value of the current will be non - zero only if the order parameters in the two superconducting layers have different phases . for the mean - field hamiltonian with s - wave order parameters",

    "otherwise , if the order parameters are not calculated self - consistently but set to a desired value ( the case of hard boundary ) then the last two terms in eq .",
    "( 14 ) can be seen as current source terms .    in our calculation",
    "the coherence factors , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are complex numbers and they will give the magnitude and the phase of the order parameters .",
    "the magnitude of the order parameters is calculated self - consistently and after each iteration the phase of the external layers is set to a desired value .",
    "for the calculation of the dc josephson current we restrict the phase of the two superconductors to a desired phase difference , while for the weak link , the phase is calculated self - consistently .",
    "for the @xmath58 tri - layers the interactions are only on - site attractive interactions . the value of the parameter @xmath19 will set the magnitude of the order parameter throughout the sample .",
    "we consider the following setup ( fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in this particular case",
    "@xmath20 is vanishing , because we ignore the d - wave symmetry .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is chosen so that @xmath65 , allowing us to describe the @xmath66 material with a lower critical temperature @xmath67 . for temperatures greater than @xmath67 the @xmath13 region can not sustain superconductivity by itself .",
    "the order parameter will leak from the stronger superconductors , and the characteristic length is called the  leaking \" distance .    0    fig.1 shows the order parameter profile for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . note that @xmath71 for the weak superconductor , while @xmath72 for the strong one .",
    "similar to the @xmath73 case the order parameter has an exponential dependence on distance away from the interface , @xmath74 .",
    "this is true only for temperatures much larger than @xmath67 and for distances from the interface greater than the coherence length of the stronger superconductors .",
    "the coefficient of the exponential decay is given by the leaking distance , @xmath75 .",
    "in the normal metal case ( @xmath76 k ) the clean limit leaking distance is inverse proportional to the temperature : @xmath77    for the case of a weak superconductor , the relevant temperature scale is @xmath78 . plotting the order parameter versus distance from the interface on a semi - log scale ( fig .",
    "2 ) for different temperatures , we can extract the leaking distance .",
    "as expected from the @xmath76 k case , the leaking distance is decreasing with increasing temperature .    -90",
    "-90    if we plot the order parameter as a function of temperature for different lengths ( l ) of the weak link ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we can observe two main effects .",
    "first , at @xmath79 k , the proximity effect will modify the order parameter at @xmath80 . for lengths smaller than 10 lattice constants",
    "this effect is important . because the @xmath66 layer is superconducting at @xmath79k , the main length scale in this layer is the superconducting coherence length @xmath81 .",
    "the second effect is observed at temperatures close to @xmath67 .",
    "if the @xmath66 layer was not connected to the superconducting layers , then , according to the mean - field behavior , the order parameter would vanish at @xmath67 . for temperatures higher than @xmath67",
    "the @xmath66 layer can not sustain superconductivity by itself .",
    "it is only in the presence of the @xmath82 layers , that the order parameter at @xmath80 has non - zero values .",
    "note that _ the length @xmath83 for which we obtain non - zero values of the order parameter above @xmath5 is much larger than the value of the length beyond which effects are unobservable at @xmath79 k_. in fig .",
    "4 , we compare the order parameters at @xmath80 for two cases : @xmath50 and @xmath69 .",
    "we observe that the order parameter for the case @xmath69 is larger and that close to @xmath67 the discrepancy is enhanced .",
    "this is a clear indication that the cooper pair leaking distance is larger in the case of a non - zero @xmath67 .    -90",
    "-90    in order to investigate further the dependence of the leaking distance on the magnitude of the superconducting correlations in the @xmath66 layer , in fig . 5",
    ", we summarize the extracted leaking distance obtained for different parameters .",
    "the @xmath76k line(dashed ) is inversely proportional to the temperature , as expected . for @xmath84",
    "k the leaking distance is diverging at @xmath5 ; this , of course leads to a giant proximity effect near these temperatures , as the figure visually demonstrates .",
    "another feature of the calculation is that for any given temperature , a higher @xmath5 will result in a larger leaking distance . for repulsive on - site interactions , @xmath85 ,",
    "the leaking distance is even smaller than in the normal metal case .",
    "this is a clear demonstration of the fact that interactions in the @xmath66 layer will influence the way cooper pairs leak from the superconducting side",
    ". such  feedback \" will not be captured in calculations that are not self - consistent .",
    "the proximity effect can be observed either by growing superconducting thin films on top of normal metals and measuring the critical temperature of the system , or by forming a josephson junction and measuring the josephson current through the weak link .",
    "if the two superconducting sides are not coupled then there is no josephson current .",
    "as we bring the superconducting sides closer to one another , the proximity effect will influence the value of the order parameter in the @xmath66 layer .",
    "a non - zero value of the order parameter throughout the whole system will result in a non - zero value of the josephson current .",
    "the bdg equations are well suited for calculating the dc josephson current . in order",
    "to have current between the two superconducting sides , the order parameters in the two sides have to have different phases .",
    "-90    in our calculation we fix the phases of the order parameter on the @xmath82 layers , and our self - consistent calculation will give the magnitude and the phase of the order parameter in the @xmath66 side .",
    "the results of such a calculation are shown in fig .",
    "6a and 6b .",
    "the phase of the order parameter in @xmath66 will vary continuously from @xmath86 to @xmath87 and the dc josephson current will be constant throughout the layer .",
    "an interesting case is the one where @xmath88 , for which there is a phase - slip point at @xmath80 .",
    "right at the phase - slip the order parameter vanishes . in order to extract only the proximity effect from the current calculation",
    ", we need to find the phase difference for which the current is maximal . for a point contact josephson junction",
    "the current has the following behavior @xcite : @xmath89 while for a long junction it deviates from the sinusoidal behavior @xcite .",
    "-90    we calculate the dc josephson current for different lengths of the weak link and for different temperatures for @xmath90 and @xmath68 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "when the two superconducting layers ( s ) are close together the proximity effect modifies the magnitude of the order parameter at l/2 in the n@xmath57 layer .",
    "a large value of the order parameter will give a large value for the current .",
    "as l increases the order parameter decreases exponentially .",
    "this results in a decay of the current as a function of l. the main result is that the behavior of the josephson current as a function of l and t reflects the existence of a leaking distance larger than the one expected from a normal metal . for @xmath90 and @xmath91 ,",
    "the normal metal gives a leaking distance of @xmath92 while the self - consistently calculated one gives a value of @xmath93 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "7 , where for @xmath94 the current is non - zero for temperatures close to but greater than @xmath5 , and it has a linear dependence on temperature near @xmath5 .    as shown in previous attempts to explain the ",
    "giant proximity effect \" , the presence of pockets of superconductivity in the n@xmath57 layer will greatly enhance the current through the system , even for long weak links . coupled with the enhancement of the leaking distance around @xmath5",
    "the presence of the superconducting pockets will effectively decrease the length of the weak link .",
    "we consider equally spaced superconducting areas with on - site interactions of strength @xmath95 embedded in the weak link with interaction strength @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "8 we show the josephson current for different lengths of the weak link and with superconducting pockets occupying a volume percentage @xmath97 of the weak link .",
    "the size of the considered pockets is one lattice site .",
    "the effect on the josephson current is drastic  the current has non - zero values well above @xmath5 .",
    "we also notice that for this volume of embedded superconductivity , the current has a weak dependence on the length of the junction .    -90",
    "-90    the strength of the coupling between the exterior superconductors will be given by the volume of these pockets .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "9 , where we plot the josephson current for a weak link of length @xmath98 as a function temperature for different percent volumes of strong superconducting pockets embedded in the weak superconductor .",
    "as expected , for @xmath99 the junction is too long to couple the strong superconductors and the current vanishes above but very close to @xmath5 . increasing @xmath100 , the junction will effectively shorten and",
    "the two exterior superconductors will be coupled well above @xmath5 .",
    "the d - wave symmetry of the order parameter is attained if we consider nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath101 and vanishing or repulsive on - site interactions .",
    "the d - wave order parameter is calculated in the following way : @xmath102 where @xmath103 describes superconducting correlations in the @xmath10 direction . in a similar manner ,",
    "as detailed in the sn@xmath57s case , we set up @xmath104 so that @xmath105 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while @xmath106 for @xmath63 .",
    "this will allow us to describe a weak link with a non - zero critical temperature .    -90",
    "-90    -90    for the 100 interface ( between the @xmath13 planes of a high-@xmath0 superconductor ) , the dependence of the order parameter is very similar to the s - wave case .",
    "10 shows the semi - log plot of the order parameter as a function of distance from the interface for different temperatures .",
    "again , we can observe the exponential decay and define the leaking distance @xmath75 .",
    "the dependence of the order parameter on temperature for different lengths of the weak link is shown in fig .",
    "11 and the two manifestations of the proximity effect are seen .",
    "first at @xmath79k the order parameter is modified if @xmath80 is of the order of the superconducting coherence length in the n@xmath57 layer .",
    "secondly , above @xmath67 the order parameter decays with increasing temperature but has non - zero value even if @xmath80 is greater than the conventional leaking distance defined by the @xmath73k case .",
    "the self - consistently calculated leaking distance is shown in fig .",
    "similar to the s - wave case it diverges at @xmath67 and , for the same temperature , larger interactions in the weak superconductor will increase the leaking distance .",
    "-90    the coherent transport in the c - axis direction will be described by the hopping amplitude in the @xmath7 direction , @xmath107 .",
    "13 shows the josephson critical current as a function of temperature for different lengths of the weak superconducting layer .",
    "the general behavior is similar to the one of the s - wave junction .",
    "the d - wave order parameter has no @xmath8 dependence , and thus in the @xmath7 direction it is an effective on - site order parameter . for short weak links the current does not vanish abruptly above @xmath5 but rather has a smooth dependence on temperature",
    "this dependence on temperature above @xmath5 shows that the length of the weak link is comparable to the leaking distance in this layer .",
    "the increase of the leaking distance due to the finite @xmath5 can not explain by itself the observed  giant proximity effect \" .",
    "it is only the conjunction with the presence of disordered pockets of superconductivity in the weak link that makes this effect possible .",
    "the calculation of the josephson current in the presence of the disordered pockets from the previous section stands also for the c - axis geometry .",
    "the extra dimension will only affect the necessary volume of superconductivity needed to observe a  giant proximity effect \" .",
    "in summary , using a tight binding formulation of the extended hubbard hamiltonian , we solve the bdg equations for a system composed of three layers : two superconducting layers ( either s - wave or d - wave ) , and a weaker superconductor sandwiched in between .",
    "we examined the proximity effect induced by the exterior superconducting layers in the  normal metal \" interior layer .",
    "we observed that , in agreement with previous calculations , the order parameter has an exponential decay behavior , the characteristic decay length being the leaking distance . in both s - wave and d - wave cases",
    "the leaking distance is only dependent on the properties of the n@xmath57 layer . for @xmath73k ( normal metal ) for both s - wave and d - wave symmetries the leaking distance is inversely proportional to the temperature . if @xmath108k , the leaking distance diverges at @xmath67 and at the same temperature larger attractive interactions in the middle layer will increase the leaking distance . essentially , the bdg formalism provides a means for the normal layer to feel pairing fluctuations above its critical temperature , @xmath5 .",
    "these are not spontaneous , in that they arise from an ` applied ' pairing field produced by the outer layers .",
    "this accounts for the much higher leaking distance for a weak superconductor .",
    "we also calculated the dc josephson current , and extracted the maximum value .",
    "we observed that the current has a non - zero value for lengths of the weak link much larger than the  conventional \" leaking distance , and for temperatures well above @xmath67 .",
    "although the divergence of the leaking distance at the critical temperature of the n@xmath57 layer enhances the josephson current for temperatures above @xmath5 , it is not enough to explain the experimental measurement of the  giant proximity effect \" @xcite . as prompted by previous attempts to explain the ",
    "giant proximity effect \" @xcite , we considered areas of superconductivity with critical temperature @xmath109 , which are embedded in the n@xmath57 layer .",
    "further enhancement of the josephson current is observed .",
    "depending on the volume of the superconducting pockets , non - zero values of the josephson current are obtained even for temperatures @xmath110 .",

    "<S> recent measurements of the josephson critical current through lsco / lco / lsco thin films showed an unusually large proximity effect . using the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations for a tight binding hamiltonian we describe the proximity effect in weak links between a superconductor with critical temperature @xmath0 and one with critical temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1. the weak link ( n ) is therefore a superconductor above its own critical temperature and the superconducting regions are considered to have either s - wave or d - wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the proximity effect is enhanced due to the presence of superconducting correlations in the weak link . </S>",
    "<S> the dc josephson current is calculated , and we obtain a non - zero value for temperatures greater than @xmath0 for sizes of the weak links that can be almost an order of magnitude greater than the conventional coherence length . considering pockets of superconductivity in the n layer , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this can lead to an even larger effect on the josephson critical current by effectively shortening the weak link . </S>"
