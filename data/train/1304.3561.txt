    "at the fundamental level of the standard model , isospin violation is due to quark mass differences as well as electromagnetic effects  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of isospin violation is an experimental tool to study quark mass effects in hadronic processes .",
    "however , in general isospin violating observables are largely dominated by the pion mass differences , which are enhanced due to the small pion mass .",
    "an exception are charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) observables .",
    "charge symmetry is the invariance of a system under rotation by 180@xmath5 around the second axis in isospin space that interchanges up and down quarks .",
    "it transforms a @xmath6 into a @xmath7 and , therefore , the pion mass difference does not contribute .",
    "@xcite calls the investigation of csb effects one of the most challenging subjects in hadron physics . on the basis of theoretical approaches with a direct connection to qcd , like lattice qcd or effective field theory ,",
    "it is possible to study quark mass effects on the hadronic level , since the effects of virtual photons are under control  for a detailed discussion on this subject see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first observation of the charge symmetry breaking @xmath8 reaction was reported for beam energies very close to the reaction threshold @xcite . at the same time information on csb in @xmath9 manifesting itself in a forward - backward asymmetry became available @xcite .",
    "these data triggered advanced theoretical calculations within effective field theory , providing the opportunity to investigate the influence of the quark masses in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this is done using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) which has been extended to pion production reactions @xcite .",
    "first steps towards a theoretical understanding of the @xmath8 reaction have been taken @xcite .",
    "soft photon exchange in the initial state could significantly enhance the cross section for @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "however , it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that a simultaneous analysis of csb in the two - nucleon sector and in @xmath8 strongly constrains the calculations .",
    "the main problem in the calculation of @xmath10 is to get theoretical control over the isospin symmetric part of the initial state interactions , for here high accuracy wave functions are needed for @xmath11 in low partial waves at relatively high energies .",
    "these can be accessed by measurements of other , isospin conserving , @xmath12 induced pion production reaction channels at a similar excess energy , such that the final state ( and , thus , also the initial state ) is constrained to small angular momenta .",
    "then , the incoming system shares some of the partial waves in the initial state with the reaction @xmath10 , while the transition operator is calculable with sufficient accuracy using chpt .",
    "such a reaction is @xmath13 and the corresponding measurement is presented here .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the institute for nuclear physics of forschungszentrum jlich in germany using the cooler synchrotron cosy @xcite together with the wasa detection system . for the measurement of @xmath0 at an excess energy of @xmath1440  mev",
    "a deuteron beam with a momentum of 1.2  gev / c was scattered on frozen deuterium pellets provided by an internal pellet target .",
    "the reaction products @xmath15 and @xmath16 were detected by the forward detector and the central detector of the wasa facility , respectively , while the neutron remained undetected .",
    "the forward detector consists of several layers of plastic scintillators for particle identification and energy reconstruction and an array of straw tubes for precise tracking .",
    "the polar angular range between 3@xmath5 and 18@xmath5 fully covers the angular range of the outgoing @xmath15 with the exception of very small angles . at this beam momentum",
    "the @xmath15 ejectiles have kinetic energies in the range of 65 - 214  mev and , thus , are already stopped in the first detector layers : in addition to the straw tube tracker only the two 3  mm thick layers of the forward window counter and the first 5 mm thick layer of the forward trigger hodoscope were used .",
    "the two photons from the @xmath16 decay were detected by the scintillator electromagnetic calorimeter as part of the central detector .",
    "photons were distinguished from charged particles using the plastic scintillator barrel located inside the calorimeter .",
    "the experiment trigger was based on a coincidence between a high energy deposit in both layers of the forward window counter together with a veto condition on the first layer of the forward range hodoscope to select helium ejectiles and a low energy neutral cluster ( @xmath17 > 20  mev ) in the calorimeter to tag the decay of the pion .",
    "further information on the wasa - at - cosy facility can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "apart from the charge symmetry breaking reaction @xmath8 with a four orders of magnitude smaller cross section , @xmath0 is the only process with a charge 2 particle and a neutral pion in final state .",
    "thus , the identification of a forward going helium and two neutral tracks forming a pion already provides a clean signature for this reaction .",
    "helium isotopes are identified by means of @xmath18 plots using the energy deposit in the forward window counter and the first layer of the forward trigger hodoscope ( fig .",

    "this rejects most of the @xmath15 going backward in the c.m . system .",
    "however , having two identical particles in the initial state and , thus , a symmetric angular distribution with respect to @xmath21 = 90@xmath5 the full angular range can be recovered by a symmetrization of the detected events .",
    "the energy deposits are also used to reconstruct the @xmath15 kinetic energy by matching the energy loss pattern to monte - carlo simulations . the @xmath15 four - momentum",
    "is completed by the direction information from the straw tube tracker .",
    "in addition to the @xmath15 two neutral clusters in the central detector corresponding to the two photons from the @xmath16 decay were requested .",
    "as event pile - up and low energy satellites of genuine photon clusters can cause larger photon multiplicities the most probable true two - photon combination was identified by selecting the pair with the @xmath22 missing mass being closest to the neutron mass . as result",
    "a nearly background free pion peak was obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : de_inv]b ) . in a final step",
    "the data were refined by applying a kinematic fit using the hypothesis @xmath0 . still remaining background and badly reconstructed events",
    "were rejected by a cut on the cumulated probability distribution at 10@xmath3 . at the end of the analysis chain about @xmath23",
    "fully reconstructed and background free @xmath0 events are available .",
    "although based on this data set any possible differential distribution can be generated  e.g. for a selective comparison with future microscopic theoretical calculations  a suitable set of observables for further analysis and presentation had to be selected . for any unpolarized measurement with three particles in final state four independent variables",
    "fully describe the reaction kinematics . for the present analysis the choice for these independent variables",
    "is based on the jacobi momenta @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath24 being the @xmath16 momentum in the overall c.m .",

    "the following variables were constructed accordingly : @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( the polar angles of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( the angle between the projections of @xmath24 and @xmath25 onto the xy - plane ) . as discussed",
    "earlier all plots show data after a symmetrization in the global c.m .",
    "system .",
    "the absolute normalization was done relative to the @xmath31 reaction .",
    "corresponding data were taken in parallel during the first part of the run using a dedicated trigger . due to the correlation between kinetic energy and scattering angle for the binary reaction , quasi mono - energetic particles form a distinct and clean peak in the @xmath32 plots .",
    "for the selected events the @xmath15 missing mass distribution reveals a background free peak at the mass of the neutron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : norm]a ) . in order to determine the integrated luminosity the data presented in ref .",

    "the authors measured the reaction @xmath33 for beam momenta between 1.09  gev / c - 1.78  gev / c and @xmath31 for beam momenta in the range of 1.65  gev / c - 2.5  gev / c .",
    "moreover , they showed that the differential cross sections for both channels at 1.65  gev / c are identical within the presented errors .",
    "based on these results we used the measured cross sections for @xmath33 to calculate the cross sections for @xmath31 at 1.2  gev / c . for this",
    "the angular distributions for the beam momenta of 1.109  gev / c , 1.387  gev / c and 1.493",
    "gev / c were parametrized . then , for selected polar angles the dependence of the differential cross section on the beam momentum was fitted and interpolated to the beam momentum of 1.2  gev / c .",
    "the resulting distribution was used as an input for the simulation of @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ fig : norm]b shows the match of the angular distribution of @xmath15 in data and the monte - carlo filtered event generator .",
    "the extracted integrated luminosity is determined to be @xmath34 , where the superscript 1 refers to the first part of the run .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity ( in total 10@xmath3 if all contributions are added quadratically ) is the dominant source for the systematic error on the absolute normalization .",
    "another source is associated with the cut on the cumulated probability distribution of the kinematic fit . in order to quantify the influence of this cut , the analysis was repeated for different regions in the probability distribution . for the total cross section",

    "however , in order to have a sufficiently precise acceptance correction a model which reproduces the experimental data reasonably well is required .",
    "the ansatz used here is the incoherent sum of a quasi - free reaction mechanism based on @xmath36 and a partial - wave expansion for the 3-body reaction .",
    "while the latter is limited to @xmath37- and @xmath4-waves , the large relative momenta between the spectator nucleon and the rest system in the quasi - free model corresponding to higher partial waves motivate the incoherent sum and the neglection of interference terms .",
    "high momentum transfer reactions involving a deuteron can proceed via the interaction with a single nucleon of the deuteron and with the second nucleon being regarded as a spectator . naturally , this mechanism is most significant in regions of the phase space where the momentum of one nucleon in final state matches the typical fermi momenta in the deuteron . in the present experiment",

    "figure  [ fig : quasi - free]a shows the momentum distribution of the neutron for data and the quasi - free model filtered by monte - carlo . as expected the quasi - free process dominates the distribution for small momenta . the lower boundary of the spectrum is caused by kinematic effects . at a beam momentum of 1.2  gev / c the reaction @xmath36 with the target proton at rest is below threshold and can only occur for @xmath39  mev / c .",
    "the vanishing acceptance at @xmath40 further increases the minimum fermi momentum .",
