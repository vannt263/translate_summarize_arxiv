    "calabi - yau compactifications of the perturbative heterotic string to @xmath0 minkowski space with @xmath1 spacetime supersymmetry occupy a prominent position in the space of string vacua . to the chagrin of the phenomenologist",
    "these models have a large number of moduli , which precludes direct applications to the real world ; however , this very same feature means that many properties of these models are readily computable and can give new insights into general features of heterotic compactifications away from the supergravity limit .    the gauged linear sigma model ( glsm )  @xcite has proven to be an important tool in the exploration of heterotic moduli spaces .",
    "it is particularly important in the studies of vacua admitting a large radius description as stable holomorphic vector bundles over calabi - yau complete intersections in toric varieties .",
    "the main utility of the glsm is the presentation of at least some of the exactly marginal deformations of the ( 0,2 ) worldsheet superconformal field theory ( scft ) as parameters in a weakly coupled uv lagrangian .",
    "this presentation , when combined with quasi - topological field theory techniques , can be used to argue that certain deformations are exactly marginal , to compute physically interesting correlators , and to connect different regions in the moduli space .",
    "a recent review of this approach may be found in  @xcite .",
    "typically , the glsm studies carried out to date have focused on deformations that preserve the rank of the holomorphic bundle . in spacetime",
    "this is tantamount to ignoring deformations along the higgs branch .",
    "the aim of this note is to explain that the glsm can also be used to probe the higgs branch , at least in the simplest situation , where the undeformed theory is a compactification of the @xmath2 heterotic string with ( 2,2 ) worldsheet supersymmetry . in that case , in the large radius limit",
    ", the stable bundle is just the tangent bundle of the calabi - yau manifold . for generic values of the ( 2,2 )",
    "moduli the gauge group is @xmath3 , and we seek to describe the higgs mechanism for the @xmath4 factor .    the main result of this work is a resolution of a puzzle , first raised in  @xcite , concerning rank - changing deformations of the most venerable model of all  the quintic hypersurface in @xmath5 . in brief ,",
    "the issue is this : it is well established that this compactification has higgs branch deformations breaking @xmath6  @xcite ; there is an obvious guess as to how these deformations are incorporated in the glsm  @xcite ; yet the application of standard glsm tools yields an inconsistent massless spectrum at the landau - ginzburg locus of the deformed model !    this is confusing to say the least , and it might dampen one s enthusiasm for applying glsm tools to explore higgs branch deformations . fortunately , there is a simple resolution .",
    "we will describe how to deform the glsm to obtain the desired deformations and , by using mirror symmetry , check that the puzzle is resolved in the full glsm .",
    "the mirror perspective will also identify the basic problem : a subtlety in the reduction of the glsm to the simpler landau - ginzburg description .",
    "while we show that care is required in using the glsm to describe the higgs branch , there are arguments that remain unmodified by turning on the deformation . for example the results of  @xcite imply that the higgs deformations are not lifted by worldsheet instanton effects . with a little bit of care the glsm can be used to study the higgs branch and continues to be a powerful and versatile tool .",
    "the rest of the note is summarized as follows . in section  [ s : genquin ]",
    "we review some standard facts about the ( 2,2 ) scft defined by the quintic hypersurface and its space of deformations , and we summarize some more general results .",
    "next , in section  [ s : glsmdef ] , we turn to the quintic glsm ; we identify a natural set of infinitesimal higgs deformations and discuss some generalizations of the construction . in section  [ s : lg ] we tackle the landau - ginzburg puzzle , and we end with a brief outlook .",
    "as originally introduced in  @xcite , the quintic compactification preserves ( 2,2 ) supersymmetry on the worldsheet . the ( 2,2 ) scft has a special khler moduli space , which locally splits into a product of the complexified khler and complex structure moduli spaces of dimensions @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the fermat quintic , defined by the vanishing of @xmath9 in @xmath5 , exhibits a global symmetry , @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 is generated by permuting the @xmath5 coordinates , while the @xmath12 maps @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ; since a diagonal phase rotation leaves @xmath5 invariant , it does not lead to a symmetry .",
    "this large symmetry group exists for all values of the khler modulus , connecting the large radius limit and the gepner point  @xcite .",
    "the charged matter is organized in @xmath15 and @xmath16 representations of @xmath4 , whose vertex operators are in one - to - one correspondence with the ( 2,2 ) moduli and thus remain massless at every smooth point in the ( 2,2 ) moduli space  @xcite . in addition to these massless fields ,",
    "analysis in the large radius limit identifies @xmath17 massless @xmath4 singlets .",
    "since these have a geometric interpretation as elements of @xmath18 , i.e. the infinitesimal deformations of the calabi - yau tangent bundle , we will refer to them as `` bundle singlets . ''",
    "these singlets can also be identified at the gepner point , leading to one of the earliest indications that ( 0,2 ) compactifications can possess remarkable ( from the low energy point of view ) non - renormalization properties .    a natural question to ask  @xcite",
    "is whether the theory has flat directions along which the ( 2,2 ) worldsheet supersymmetry is broken to ( 0,2 )  the minimum necessary for an @xmath1 spacetime supersymmetric heterotic vacuum  @xcite .",
    "there are two types of deformations to consider : one might either try to give a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to a bundle singlet or move onto the higgs branch by giving vevs to the @xmath15 and @xmath19s . in the large radius limit the latter corresponds to deformations of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the trivial bundle over the calabi - yau .",
    "the existence of a higgs branch , at least for special values of complex structure moduli , is established by a beautiful argument combining worldsheet and spacetime ideas  @xcite . as it is rather important for our purposes to feel sure that this branch exists",
    ", we will review this argument . from the spacetime point of view",
    "an infinitesimal higgs deformation may be obstructed by d- or f - terms . in the case of breaking @xmath22",
    ", we expect that the former can be made to vanish by judiciously relating the @xmath15 and @xmath19 vevs . to examine the f - terms obstructions , the authors of  @xcite note that when the unperturbed vacuum is defined by a cft ( as opposed to a sigma - model expansion around the infinite distance large radius limit ) , then the effective superpotential for the massless fields should be given by a power - series in the fields .",
    "thus , if the f - term obstruction vanishes to all orders in the fields , it must vanish exactly .",
    "suppose then that the complex structure moduli are tuned to the @xmath23-preserving locus , and we consider an infinitesimal deformation that gives vevs to the @xmath15 and @xmath24  the multiplet corresponding to the unique permutation - invariant monomial @xmath25 .",
    "the possible f - term obstructions are of the form @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is any singlet . however , some of the g - transformations act as discrete r - symmetries of the unperturbed theory , and these r - symmetries rule out both types of couplings . , where we slightly generalize the result . ]",
    "since the obstructions vanish to all orders , we conclude that the deformation can be integrated to a flat higgs direction .",
    "the discrete r - symmetries identified in  @xcite also imply that the bundle singlets remain massless on the @xmath23-preserving locus of the moduli space , thereby providing a low energy explanation for the seemingly miraculous absence of otherwise allowed f - terms .",
    "nevertheless , a more delicate reasoning  @xcite demonstrates that ( 0,2 ) models appear to be string miracles : the bundle singlets have a flat potential for all values of the ( 2,2 ) moduli !",
    "these results have since been understood in a more general context of the glsm : since all of the @xmath4-neutral singlets are represented as deformations of a glsm lagrangian , one can apply the arguments of  @xcite to show that every one of the @xmath29 singlets constitutes a flat direction .",
    "these arguments can be generalized to many more ( 2,2 ) and ( 0,2 ) compactifications with a glsm description .",
    "a ( 2,2 ) model with a glsm description naturally includes three types of @xmath4-preserving deformations : the ( 2,2)-preserving `` toric '' khler and the `` polynomial '' complex structure deformations , as well as polynomial bundle deformations , which preserve ( 0,2 ) supersymmetry and in a large radius limit correspond to unobstructed deformations of the tangent bundle . in general bundle deformations can be lifted by worldsheet instantons  @xcite . however , in the glsm context the possible lifting is highly constrained by the results of  @xcite : it is expected that worldsheet instanton corrections due to the toric khler moduli do not lift the deformations that are representable in the glsm .    the results of  @xcite can also be applied in the more general context of generic ( 0,2 ) theories with a glsm description . in favorable cases , e.g. models based on a stable bundle over a calabi - yau manifold without non - toric khler parameters",
    ", these arguments should be sufficient to show that the compactification is not destabilized by worldsheet instantons .    having assured ourselves that we stand on reasonably firm ground",
    ", we will now discuss how to construct higgs deformations in the glsm . to that end",
    ", we will first discuss the unperturbed theory .",
    "we begin with the familiar structure of the glsm for the ( 2,2 ) supersymmetric compactification of the quintic . it will be convenient to state the field content in terms of ( 0,2 ) multiplets .",
    "we have bosonic chiral multiplets @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , as well as fermi multiplets @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the latter are not chiral but instead obey the constraints @xmath36 .",
    "these fields are coupled to a ( 0,2 ) vector multiplet with a chiral fermi field - strength multiplet @xmath37 .",
    "the superspace expansions of these multiplets are as follows : @xmath38 this is given in @xmath39 signature with gauge - covariant derivatives @xmath40 and superspace derivatives @xmath41 @xmath42 is the top component of the vector field multiplet , @xmath43 is the gauge field - strength , and the @xmath23 are auxiliary fields .",
    "the lagrangian is constrained by the @xmath44 gauge symmetry , as well as a non - anomalous @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "the charges of the multiplets are indicated in table  [ table : m0charges ] , which also includes an additional fermi multiplet @xmath46 .",

    "when @xmath48 , we simply recover the familiar quintic spectrum .",
    "so , without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath49 is irreducible and zero - dimensional .",

    "in the present case the computation is considerably simplified when organized by degree .",

    "note that @xmath75 } = r_{[d]}/ \\cj$ ] , a simple generalization of the familiar lg chiral ring .",
    "since @xmath50 is irreducible and zero - dimensional , the homology is concentrated in the two right - most entries  @xcite .",

    "the main new feature here is that we must identify states with internal energy @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    *",

    "the analysis of the remaining sectors is , if anything , simpler , and combining all of the results leads to the `` puzzling '' spectrum described in section  [ ss : lgpuzzle ] .      in this section",
    "we will present a slight generalization of the discrete r - symmetry arguments used in  @xcite .",
    "this generalization is based on the simple fact that the lg presentation of the spectrum makes it easy to determine the transformation properties of all the massless fields under the discrete r - symmetries . in this section",
    "we label states by their @xmath109 representations .",
    "consider the lg theory on the five - dimensional @xmath11-preserving locus of complex structures .",
    "the @xmath11 is a global symmetry in the spacetime theory , and we seek to determine the action of permutations on the spectrum of massless fermions .",
    "the massless fermions are presented as states @xmath110 , where @xmath21 is an operator constructed from the first excited modes of the twisted fields , and the action of a permutation @xmath111 takes the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is simply obtained by permuting the modes in @xmath21 , and @xmath114 .",
    "our task is to determine the @xmath115 .",
    "we begin with some intuition from the large radius analysis . under odd permutations of the @xmath5",
    "coordinates the holomorphic @xmath116-form @xmath117 changes sign , and hence odd permutations should correspond to r - symmetries ( see , for instance , section 16.5.3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath117 , or rather , the corresponding chiral primary operator in the scft , is the square of the right - moving spectral flow generator @xmath118 , we see that the odd permutation acts as @xmath119 .",
    "of course there is a similar action on the left - moving spectral flow operator : @xmath120 , with @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "our primary interest is in these r - symmetries , and we will restrict attention to odd permutations henceforth .",
    "the right - moving spectral flow operators show up in spacetime supercharges , and in our conventions we have @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the spin - field for the @xmath125 ghost system , while the @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the spin - fields for the fermions in the ( 0,1 ) multiplets of the @xmath128 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) carries charges @xmath98 and @xmath90 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "in particular , a gauge boson @xmath132 transforms under supersymmetry as @xmath133 and hence the gaugino @xmath134 ( corresponding to a state with @xmath90 ) should transform the same way as @xmath129 under @xmath111 . for example , the @xmath135 gauginos represented by @xmath136 in the lg spectrum are the ten free left - moving fermions . ] should pick up a phase @xmath137 under @xmath111 , implying @xmath138 . since the @xmath139 and @xmath140 gauginos are related to the gauginos in the @xmath57 sector by left - moving spectral flow",
    ", we also find @xmath141 although @xmath111 does not act homogeneously on the @xmath4 representations , it is easy to combine it with a @xmath142 gauge transformation to define an action @xmath143 that does act homogeneously on the gauginos , @xmath144 .",
    "this is clearly an r - symmetry , with the spacetime superspace coordinates transforming as @xmath145 .",
    "note that @xmath146 .",
    "next , we consider the chiral ( i.e. @xmath91 ) @xmath19 states . at the gepner point",
    "the @xmath8 @xmath147 in the @xmath57 sector have the form @xmath148 , where @xmath21 is a quintic polynomial in the @xmath60 .",
    "hence , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 simply permutes the @xmath60 .",
    "the remaining components of @xmath19 are related by left - spectral flow , and it is not hard to verify that @xmath151 .",
    "the transformation of the single @xmath152 is completely determined by that of @xmath153 .",
    "the @xmath154 sector also contains the superpartner of the khler modulus , represented by @xmath155 .",
    "since the khler modulus is invariant under all permutations , its chiral superpartner must transform oppositely to @xmath156 , which implies @xmath157 . since left - moving spectral flow relates @xmath153 to @xmath158 and @xmath158 to @xmath159",
    ", we see that @xmath160 .",
    "the @xmath161 transformations of @xmath82 and @xmath162 imply that all of the @xmath4 singlets transform as @xmath163 .",
    "we have now determined the transformations of all the chiral fermions as well as @xmath156 , and from this we easily obtain the transformations of the chiral superfields under odd permutations : @xmath164 of course the superpotential must transform as @xmath165 , i.e. @xmath166 .",
    "but now we simply observe that the terms @xmath167 and @xmath168 , where @xmath169 corresponds to the unique permutation - invariant monomial @xmath170 , can not appear in @xmath171 .",
    "thus , for any point on the @xmath11 locus we have found a class of unobstructed deformations higgsing @xmath6 .",
    "since the symmetry and the charge assignments persist for any value of the khler modulus , we can extend this to large radius as well .",
    "that is of course what we might expect from the supergravity analysis of  @xcite .",
    "let us finally note that the phases @xmath172 can be determined without appealing to any large radius intuition .",
    "consider , for instance , the permutation exchanging the chiral superfields @xmath173 and @xmath174 in some ( 2,2 ) lg orbifold . in order for this to be a symmetry , the two fields must have equal weight , and therefore also @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "we can then think of the permutation as a global @xmath177 symmetry that commutes with the landau - ginzburg orbifold and leaves @xmath178 invariant , while changing the sign of @xmath179 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the phase of the twisted vacuum @xmath180 under such a global symmetry is given by @xmath181 applying this to the quintic , it is easy to check that this leads to the same results as above .",
    "in this appendix we will try to recover the ( 2,2 ) locus in the nlsm derived from the m2 glsm in the classical low energy limit . to obtain this limit",
    ", we must take the dimensionful couplings of the gauge theory to infinity .",
    "these naturally include the gauge coupling @xmath183 , as well as the superpotential couplings .",
    "the resulting low energy theory receives quantum corrections that are suppressed in the limit @xmath184 .",
    "we will compare the low energy actions obtained from the quintic and m2 glsms .    in the @xmath185",
    "limit the fluctuations of the gauge multiplets are suppressed , while the d - term is imposed as a constraint on the fields : the light bosons must satisfy @xmath186 in addition , when @xmath111 is a non - singular hypersurface ( i.e. @xmath187 has no solutions in @xmath5 ) , the bosons are further constrained to @xmath188 and @xmath189 . to solve these constraints ,",
    "we work in a patch with @xmath190 and define affine coordinates @xmath191 , @xmath192 . fixing the gauge to @xmath193 , the d - term constraint is solved by @xmath194 since we must also demand @xmath195 , we choose a parametrization @xmath196 , @xmath197 for solutions to @xmath195 in the @xmath198 patch .    in the quintic glsm",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath199 are also suppressed in the @xmath200 limit , and we can eliminate it via its algebraic equation of motion : @xmath201 .",
    "the remaining terms in the action are then a sum of @xmath202 the parameter @xmath203 is introduced to distinguish the quintic ( @xmath204 ) and m2 ( @xmath205 ) glsms .    the bosonic action of the nlsm is obtained by integrating out the @xmath206 gauge field .",
    "this leads to @xmath207 where @xmath208 are the bosonic terms in the @xmath209 gauge current @xmath210 a slightly tedious computation yields the expected result : @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the pull - back of the @xmath5 fubini - study metric to @xmath213 in the @xmath198 patch .",
    "the fermionic action is a bit more interesting . to simplify its form ,",
    "we introduce a change of basis @xmath214 where the @xmath215 are given by @xmath216 and satisfy @xmath217 with this choice of basis the yukawa terms in  ( [ eq : quinticaction ] ) simplify to @xmath218 we now see that @xmath219 is a lagrange multiplier for @xmath220 , and similarly , when @xmath221 , integration over @xmath222 will force @xmath223 . since @xmath111 is non - singular , in the low energy limit the last term gives large masses to the @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 fermions .",
    "we can therefore set these excitations to zero . remembering to include the fermions contributions to the equations of motion for @xmath206 gauge fields , we find @xmath228 + i r{\\overline{\\chi}}\\p_+\\chi + i ( { \\overline{\\chi}}^{{\\overline{a } } } { \\overline{s}}^i_{{\\overline{a } } } \\p_+\\phi_i \\chi + { \\overline{\\chi}}{\\overline{\\phi}}_i \\p_+ s^i_a \\chi^a ) \\cr ~ & ~~-r^{-1 } h_{{\\overline{a}}b } { \\overline{\\eta}}^{{\\overline{a } } } \\eta^b ( r { \\overline{\\chi}}\\chi + h_{{\\overline{c}}d } { \\overline{\\chi}}^{{\\overline{c } } } \\chi^d ) + \\alpha r^{-1 } h_{{\\overline{a}}b } h_{{\\overline{c}}d } { \\overline{\\chi}}^{{\\overline{a}}}\\eta^{b } { \\overline{\\eta}}^{{\\overline{c}}}\\chi^{d } + \\alpha ( \\lambda_+{\\overline{\\chi}}+ { \\overline{\\lambda}}_+\\chi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath229 are the usual covariant derivatives with the christoffel connection for the metric @xmath212 .",
    "setting @xmath230 , we obtain the fermion action for the quintic glsm : @xmath231 the four - fermi term is the riemann tensor for @xmath212 , and @xmath232 is just the familiar ( 2,2 ) nlsm action for the quintic with induced metric @xmath212 .    setting @xmath205 , we obtain the m2 model for @xmath233 . as far as the bosons and right - moving fermions",
    "are concerned , we of course obtain the same form as the quintic action ; however , the left - moving degrees of freedom are markedly different , as this is genuinely a ( 0,2 ) nlsm .",
    "to describe the action , we let @xmath234 and define the following diagonal metric on @xmath235 @xmath236 as well as connection @xmath237 , with @xmath238 this connection has a @xmath239 curvature two - form @xmath240 , @xmath241 and the left - moving part of the action is written as @xmath242 where @xmath243 is defined with the pull - back of the connection @xmath244 .",
    "clearly the m2 glsm with @xmath233 does not reduce to the naive expectation of a ( 2,2 ) quintic nlsm and a free left - moving fermion @xmath245 . since @xmath240 has full rank",
    ", we can not obtain the desired theory by a field redefinition .",
    "of course there is an easy way to obtain the expected theory by varying @xmath244 .",
    "we write @xmath246 so that the ( 2,2 ) quintic nlsm ( with a free left - moving fermion ) is obtained at @xmath247 , while the m2 nlsm is found at @xmath248 .",
    "it is instructive to linearize the deformation of the action at @xmath247 .",
    "the quintic nlsm is invariant under a ( 0,2 ) supersymmetry , with non - zero @xmath72 variations @xmath249 linearizing @xmath250 around @xmath247 , we find @xmath251 , and @xmath252 , with @xmath253 it is not hard to check that the resulting @xmath254 is @xmath72-closed up to equations of motion of the left - moving fermions .",
    "this deformation is not @xmath72-exact , and in fact takes the form of a ( 0,2 ) superpotential coupling .",
    "turning on the @xmath255 coupling has a clear geometric significance .",
    "since @xmath251 , and the change in @xmath244 is not pure gauge , this is a deformation of @xmath256 , and a look at @xmath257 will convince the reader that this is a deformation by an element of @xmath258 without an accompanying @xmath259 element .",
    "such a deformation can not by itself lead to a stable bundle , and thus , the reduction of the m2 model with @xmath233 naively appears to be destabilized .",
    "we do not think this means that the large radius ( 2,2 ) locus can not be recovered in the context of the m2 model ; however , our simple analysis certainly suggests that the limit @xmath260 has some subtleties that remain to be understood properly .",
    "for instance , it might be that ( 2,2 ) supersymmetry only emerges as an accidental ir symmetry .",
    "of course none of these issues arise in the m1 model .",
    "there we can identify the ( 2,2 ) locus in terms of glsm parameters , and this simple clarification is certainly worth the price of extra fields in the uv .",
