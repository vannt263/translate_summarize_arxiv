    "the study of neutron star magnetic fields in accreting x - ray pulsars has progressed significantly over the past few decades through the observations of cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsfs ) , or cyclotron lines . beginning with the discovery in 1976 of such a feature in her  x@xmath01 @xcite ,",
    "we now have identified about two dozen accreting x - ray pulsars that exhibit cyclotron line features .",
    "the fundamental line energies range from 10 to 55 kev , implying magnetic field strengths from about 1 to 5 tg .",
    "recent work to model the accretion column emission from a physics - based point of view is based upon the accreted material passing through a radiative , radiation dominated shock and forming a thermal mound just above the surface at the magnetic poles , as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "conditions in the infalling supersonic material are dominated by either radiation pressure at high luminosities or coulomb interactions at lower luminosities before settling on the neutron star surface . at the lowest luminosities",
    "no shock is formed and the material flows unabated until reaching the mound of material piled up on the magnetic poles . at high luminosities  defined as above the critical luminosity where radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure @xcite an increase in flux causes the shock , and thus the scattering region , to rise and sample lower magnetic field strengths , giving rise to a negative correlation of the cyclotron line energy with luminosity .",
    "physically , the structure of accretion column starts changing with decreasing mass accretion rate when the photon diffusion time across the optically thick column becomes comparable to the matter settling time from the radiative shock height , and generally can be different in different sources .",
    "first estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows it to be around @xmath2  erg s@xmath3 if the height of the radiative shock above the neutron star surface is comparable to the accretion column radius . with further decrease in the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star magnetic poles ,",
    "the accretion flow decelerates most likely due to plasma instabilities leading to the formation of a collisionless shock , as numerical calculations performed at @xmath4  g s@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest . the intermediate regime ( i.e. between the radiative shock at high accretion rates and collisionless shock ) is the most difficult to treatment , and still is to be explored numerically with taking into account the relevant complicated microphysics . in the collisionless shock regime ,",
    "the height of the the scattering region decreases with increasing mass accretion rate thus producing a positive correlation of the cyclotron line with luminosity .",
    "@xcite reproduces the same correlations with the line forming region being that between the top of the thermal mound and a height equal to twice the accretion column radius , both of which rise as the luminosity increases . @xcite",
    "have asserted a reflection model for the cyclotron line formation in which the shocked infalling matter generates x - rays that illuminate the atmosphere of the neutron star . in this case , increased accretion , and thus increased luminosity , increases the height of the x - ray emitting region and thus increases the area of the neutron star that is illuminated .",
    "this increased area contains lower values of the dipole magnetic field and thus the resulting cyclotron line has a lower value .",
    "to date six accreting x - ray pulsars are known to have correlations of the fundamental cyclotron line energy with luminosity : one with a negative correlation , v  0332 + 53 @xcite , and five with a positive correlation , her  x@xmath01 @xcite , gx  304@xmath01 @xcite , a  0535 + 26 @xcite , the first harmonic of vela  x@xmath01 @xcite , and cep  x@xmath04 @xcite .",
    "note : 4u0115 + 63 is no longer deemed to have a correlation of the cyclotron line energy with luminosity @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently published results from analysis of _",
    "swift_/bat observations of vela x-1 where they find a positive correlation of the first harmonic cyclotron line energy with luminosity , and in addition , find a flattening of the correlation with increasing luminosity .",
    "other spectral components , such as the power law index ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and iron line flux , have been seen to vary with accretion rate as expressed by the x - ray flux .",
    "gx 304@xmath01 was first detected in a balloon flight @xcite and later by the _",
    "uhuru _ satellite as 2u1258 - 61 @xcite .",
    "it is an accreting neutron star exhibiting a teragauss magnetic field in a high mass x - ray binary system with its companion b2vne star , v850 cen @xcite .",
    "the system has an orbital period of 132.1885@xmath60.022 days @xcite , a pulse period of @xmath1272 seconds @xcite , and a distance of 2.4@xmath60.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "after a nearly three decade period of quiescence , gx 304@xmath01 emerged in 2008 @xcite , and began a series of regularly spaced outbursts in late 2009 ( see fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "a cyclotron resonance scattering feature at @xmath154 kev was discovered during the 2010 august outburst @xcite , and a possible positive correlation with flux was suggested .",
    "this has been confirmed with recent _",
    "integral_results by @xcite , who found the line varying between @xmath148kev and @xmath155kev , and by @xcite who found the range to be 50 to 59 kev with newer _ integral_calibrations .",
