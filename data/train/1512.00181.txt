    "<S> a precise error estimate of the formula is given and the effect on the discretization of the used integral of the measured data in the formula is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the formula requires a large frequency to converge ; however , the number of time interval divisions grows exponetially as the frequency increases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a given number of divisions , we fixed the trusted frequency region of convergence with some given error bound . </S>",
    "<S> the trusted frequency region is computed theoretically using theorems provided in this paper and is numerically implemented for various cases . </S>",
