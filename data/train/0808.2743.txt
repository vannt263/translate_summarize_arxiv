    "<S> using the coupled - cluster method for infinite lattices and the exact diagonalization method for finite lattices , we study the influence of an exchange anisotropy @xmath0 on the ground - state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 frustrated @xmath1@xmath2 xxz antiferromagnet on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we find that increasing @xmath3 ( i.e. an ising type easy - axis anisotropy ) as well as decreasing @xmath4 ( i.e. an xy type easy - plane anisotropy ) both lead to a monotonic shrinking of the parameter region of the magnetically disordered quantum phase . </S>",
    "<S> finally , at @xmath5 this quantum phase disappears , whereas in the pure xy limit ( @xmath6 ) there is still a narrow region around @xmath7 where the quantum paramagnetic ground - state phase exists .    a canonical model to study </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations in magnetic systems is the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice with nearest - neighbour ( nn ) coupling @xmath1 and frustrating next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) coupling @xmath1 ( @xmath1@xmath2 model ) , see , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent syntheses of magnetic materials that can be well described by the @xmath8-@xmath9 model @xcite has stimulated further interest in the model . </S>",
    "<S> for the isotropic spin-@xmath10 @xmath1@xmath2 model there are two magnetically ordered ground state ( gs ) phases at small and at large @xmath2 separated by an intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase ( qpp ) without magnetic long - range order ( lro ) in the region @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the gs at @xmath14 exhibits nel lro . </S>",
    "<S> the twofold degenerate gs at @xmath15 shows so - called collinear magnetic lro . </S>",
    "<S> these two collinear gs s are characterized by a parallel spin orientation of nearest neighbours in the vertical direction and an antiparallel spin orientation of nearest neighbours in the horizontal direction [ collinear - columnar ( cc ) state ] , and vice versa ( collinear - row state ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the transition between the nel phase and the qpp as well as the properties of the qpp are still under debate @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several extensions of the @xmath1@xmath2 model have been studied recently , see , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it was found that by increasing the spatial dimensionality from @xmath16 to @xmath17 the intermediate qpp disappears @xcite . with respect to experimental realizations of the @xmath1@xmath2 model </S>",
    "<S> an exchange anisotropy could be relevant . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , only a few papers so far have considered this issue . </S>",
    "<S> some recent papers have discussed the special cases where ( i ) only the nn coupling @xmath1 is anisotropic @xcite or , alternatively , where ( ii ) only the nnn coupling @xmath2 becomes anisotropic @xcite . in materials </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be more likely that both couplings , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding model is the square - lattice spin-@xmath18 @xmath8-@xmath9 xxz model @xmath19 where the first sum runs over all nn and the second sum runs over all nnn pairs . to our best knowledge </S>",
    "<S> the only study by other authors of such an anisotropic @xmath1@xmath2 model with the same anisotropy in the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 term has be performed by benyoussef et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using linear spin - wave theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover these authors considered @xmath20 only . </S>",
    "<S> however , from early studies of igarashi @xcite of the isotropic @xmath1@xmath2 model it is known that higher orders in the @xmath21 expansion become large near the quantum critical point ( qcp ) , and hence results from the lowest order ( i.e. linear ) spin - wave theory become unreliable . as in our previous work @xcite on @xmath8-@xmath9 models on the square lattice , </S>",
    "<S> we use here the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) complemented by exact diagonalisation ( ed ) of a finite square lattice of @xmath22 sites ( imposing periodic boundary conditions ) to investigate the effect of exchange anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the ccm is an effective tool for studying highly frustrated quantum magnets @xcite , where , e.g. , the quantum monte carlo method is not applicable due to the minus - sign problem .    for the ccm treatment of the model ( [ ham ] ) , we use the classical gs ( nel at small @xmath2 and cc at large @xmath2 ) as reference state @xmath23 . starting from these reference states </S>",
    "<S> the ccm employs the exponential parametrization @xmath24 of the quantum gs @xmath25 where the correlation operator @xmath26 contains all possible multi - spin - flip correlations present in the true gs . naturally , @xmath26 has to be approximated . </S>",
    "<S> we use the well - elaborated ccm - lsub@xmath27 approximation @xcite to calculate the gs energy per spin @xmath28 and the sublattice magnetization per spin @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> since the lsub@xmath27 approximation becomes exact for @xmath30 , it is useful to extrapolate the ` raw ' lsub@xmath27 data to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> there are well - tested extrapolation formulas , namely @xmath31 for the gs energy per spin @xcite and @xmath32 for the sublattice magnetization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will not present more details of the ccm , but rather refer , e.g. , to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the gs energy plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ e ] for three characterictic values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above we use for the ccm calculations the nel reference state at small @xmath2 , but the cc reference state at large @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the ccm curves typically consists of two parts belonging to nel and cc reference states . </S>",
    "<S> the curves for @xmath33 shown in fig .  [ e](a ) illustrate clearly that there is a parameter region around @xmath34 where the ccm equations using classical nel and cc reference states do not have real solutions . as a consequence , the corresponding pair of gs energy curves for the nel and cc phases do not intersect one another . this behaviour yields preliminary evidence for the opening up of an intermediate phase between the nel and cc phases . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , for @xmath6 and @xmath35 the corresponding pairs of gs energy curves almost cross one another giving preliminary evidence that for strong anisotropy a direct first - order transition between both semiclassical magnetic phases may occur . from the ed data </S>",
    "<S> it is also evident , that the behaviour of the gs energy for the isotropic model , i.e. @xmath36 , differs from that for @xmath6 and @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we present in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ m ] the sublattice magnetization @xmath29 calculated by the ccm for @xmath37 and the square of an order parameter defined as @xmath38 @xcite calculated by ed for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> more data for @xmath29 can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . while @xmath29 is finite in the magnetically ordered phases but vanishes in the intermediate qpp , we have always finite values for @xmath40 for finite @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the ccm results for @xmath29 to define the qcp s @xmath41 and @xmath42 as that points where the magnetic order parameter [ nel at @xmath41 and cc at @xmath43 becomes zero . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ m ] it is obvious that the intermediate qpp is largest for @xmath44 ( the ccm estimates for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 , cf </S>",
    "<S> . refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . both types of anisotropy lead to a stabilization of magnetic lro . </S>",
    "<S> the ed data for @xmath40 support these findings . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ m](b ) it can be seen that the parameter region of small values of @xmath40 around @xmath50 is significantly broader for @xmath49 than for @xmath51 and @xmath52 . from the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ m](a ) it is also obvious that the pair of ccm order - parameter curves ( nel and cc ) for @xmath35 intersect one another at a value @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour can be interpreted as an indication of a first - order transition between the magnetically ordered nel and cc phases located at the crossing point , for a detailed discussion of this issue see also refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the anisotropy on the correlator @xmath54 is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](a ) for @xmath55 , i.e. near the qcp @xmath45 where the nel lro breaks down for @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath54 decays most rapidly for @xmath33 . for the largest separation @xmath56 present for @xmath39 sites , the correlator @xmath57 for @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> is reduced by frustration by a factor of @xmath58 for @xmath49 , whereas the corresponding factor is only @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) for @xmath35 ( @xmath6 ) .    finally , we summarize our findings on the gs magnetic ordering in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](b ) where the gs phase diagram is shown . the solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](b ) represent those points in the ( @xmath61 ) parameter space where the nel and the cc order parameter calculated by the ccm vanish . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the anisotropy leads to a monotonic shrinking of the region of the qpp . </S>",
    "<S> for the easy - axis anisotropy all three phases meet at a quantum triple point at ( @xmath62 ) , i.e. the qpp disappears completely for @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for the case of the easy - plane anisotropy a second quantum triple point occurs at ( @xmath64 ) . outside the area hemmed by the solid lines </S>",
    "<S> there is a direct first - order transition between the nel and the cc phase , as indicated by the dotted lines . </S>"
