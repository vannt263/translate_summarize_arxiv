    "the purely leptonic decays of the charged @xmath3 mesons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are of much interest , both in the standard model ( sm ) and in the context of models beyond the sm . the vast majority of @xmath11 mesons ( i.e. a bound state of @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) decay via the subprocess @xmath14 , where @xmath15 ( the latter two via penguin operators ) and @xmath16 are either quarks or leptons .",
    "a purely leptonic final state can occur via the annihilation process @xmath17 , although with a very suppressed rate ( fig .",
    "[ leptonicdecay ] ) .",
    "annihilation to @xmath18 is the dominant decay mechanism for the lighter charged mesons @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while for @xmath21 the purely leptonic decays @xmath22 and @xmath18 have been observed with subdominant branching ratios ( brs ) in the range @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "no such purely leptonic decay has been observed for @xmath11 mesons .",
    "although their search is problematic at the hadronic b factories ( e.g.tevatron run ii ) due to the missing energy of the @xmath24 , upper limits on their brs were obtained at @xmath2 colliders by cleo @xcite and the lep collaborations @xcite .",
    "belle @xcite and babar @xcite are already producing more stringent limits , and expect to be sensitive to the sm rate by 2005/2006 .",
    "observation of such decays would offer a direct measurement of the @xmath11 decay constant @xmath25 .",
    "is mediated by annihilation into a virtual @xmath26 ( and in extensions of the sm also by a charged higgs ) .",
    "[ leptonicdecay],width=226 ]    these decays are also sensitive to many well motivated extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "charged higgs bosons ( @xmath4 ) appear in any model with two higgs @xmath27 doublets ( which includes all supersymmetric models ) and/or with higgs triplets ( which can provide neutrino mass ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to many other rare decays ( e.g. @xmath28 ) which are influenced by new physics at the one loop level , the decays @xmath29 are sensitive at tree  level to @xmath4 and can be enhanced up to the current experimental limits @xcite . from these upper limits very useful constraints on the parameter @xmath5 can be obtained ( where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the vacuum expectation values of the higgs doublets ) , which are comparable ( and often superior ) to those from processes like @xmath32 @xcite and @xmath33 . the sm predictions for @xmath34 suffer from a sizeable uncertainty in @xmath25 , whose value can only be calculated using non  perturbative techniques such as lattice qcd or inferred from other processes ( e.g. @xmath35 mixing ) .",
    "the current errors in such calculations induce an uncertainty in the sm brs of around @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "it is likely that this sizeable error together with the small rates has dissuaded explicit calculations of higher order corrections , which would navely be expected to be at the @xmath37 level or less .",
    "however , we turn out attention to @xmath0 and @xmath1 for three reasons .    *",
    "large corrections to the @xmath6 coupling are possible in supersymmetric ( susy ) models for large @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "such corrections should significantly affect the brs for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the derived constraints on @xmath5 . * due to the successful running of the @xmath3 factories",
    ", the sm rate for both decays will be within experimental sensitivity by 2005/2006 .",
    "higher luminosity upgrades are now being discussed @xcite which would offer an ideal environment for precision studies of these decays . *",
    "improvements in lattice techniques resulting in more precise predictions for @xmath25 @xcite are expected in the next few years .",
    "data from the recently approved cleo - c @xcite will play an important role in refining the techniques .    the advances in ( ii ) and ( iii ) will facilitate the search for new physics in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and leads us to consider the higher order corrections to these decays in ( i ) .",
    "our work is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the tree ",
    "level contribution of @xmath4 and summarise the current experimental status . in section 3",
    "we introduce the susy corrections while section 4 presents our numerical results .",
    "finally , section 5 contains our conclusions .",

    "below we write the lagrangian for @xmath54 induced by @xmath56 and @xmath57 exchange : @xmath58\\left[\\overline l \\gamma^\\mu(1-\\gamma_5)\\nu\\right]-r_l\\left[\\overline u(1+\\gamma_5)b\\right]\\left[\\overline l ( 1-\\gamma_5)\\nu\\right]\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath59 here we only keep the dominant @xmath60 part of the @xmath6 coupling .",
    "the two quarks need to be at zero separation in order to annihilate and this probability is contained in the decay constant which is defined as :    @xmath61    the decays proceed via the axial ",
    "vector part of the @xmath53 coupling and via the pseudoscalar part of the @xmath4 coupling .",

    "level approximation .",
    "this is because @xmath67 in @xmath68 originates from the @xmath69 quark yukawa coupling ( @xmath70 ) which at lowest order is simply related to @xmath67 by @xmath71 .",
    "therefore @xmath67 in the numerator in @xmath72 cancels with @xmath67 in the denominator . at the 1-loop level",
    "the simple relationship between @xmath70 and the running quark mass @xmath67 is modified , resulting in large corrections which will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "one can see from the expression for @xmath73 that the @xmath4 contribution interferes destructively with that of @xmath53 .",
    "enhancement of these decays ( @xmath74 ) requires @xmath75 , while exact cancellation ( @xmath76 ) of the @xmath53 and @xmath4 contributions occurs for @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "table  [ explimits ] displays the sm predictions for br(@xmath34 ) along with the current experimental limits from various machines .",
    "we take @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 .",
    "the brs are hierarchical due to the aforementioned @xmath64 suppression .",
    "br(@xmath0 ) is much larger than br(@xmath1 ) , but both decays are within range of data samples with @xmath81 @xmath11 mesons .",
    "br(@xmath82 ) is too small for any current or planned experiment .",
    "the detection efficiency for @xmath1 is far superior to that for @xmath0 , which compensates for the smaller br of the muonic channel .",
    "hence these two decays are competitive with each other for probing new physics and/or for offering measurements of the decay constant @xmath25 .",
    "the upper limits in table  1 on @xmath0 ( from babar ) and @xmath1 ( from belle ) constrain @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively . for @xmath79 mev",
    "this gives a bound on @xmath85 gev@xmath86 from @xmath0 , with weaker limits from @xmath1 .",
    "data samples of order @xmath87 @xmath11 mesons , which are expected by 2006 , should allow sensitivity to the sm rate ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "babar simulations give yields of 17 and 8 events ( after all cuts ) for the @xmath22 and @xmath18 channels respectively @xcite , which would be enough to make a first measurement of the brs , or , in the case of non - observation , would restrict @xmath89 gev@xmath86 .",
    "although the tree  level expression contains a sizeable error from the uncertainty in @xmath90 we feel that including higher order corrections to the rates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 is well motivated , since current experiments will reach the sensitivity of the sm prediction in the next few years .",
    "in addition higher luminosity upgrades of both pep - ii and kekb are being discussed , which would provide data samples of @xmath91 @xmath11 mesons and allow precision measurements of these decays @xcite .",
    "importantly , the @xmath4 contribution can already saturate the current experimental limits ( as shown in section [ btotaunu ] ) , and so one or both of @xmath22 and @xmath18 might be observed in the near future .",
    "the constraints on @xmath5 derived from these decays are among the most model independent constraints on this important ratio .",
    "we stress that other rare decays ( e.g. @xmath92 ) can also give strong constraints on @xmath5 @xcite .    the observed inclusive decay @xmath93 @xcite is also sensitive to @xmath4 at tree - level and provides competitive , mostly model independent limits of @xmath94",
    ". the exclusive decay @xmath95 will be pursued at the @xmath3 factories @xcite .",
    "constraints on @xmath5 from the unobserved top quark decay @xmath33 at the tevatron run i are inferior to those from @xmath96 and @xmath93 , but will improve significantly with 2 fb@xmath86 expected during run ii @xcite . given the importance of these constraints on @xmath5 , we feel that higher order corrections to the rates for br(@xmath96 ) and br(@xmath97 ) should be considered .",
    "we believe that a closer analysis of these decays is timely due to the anticipated improvements in lattice calculations of @xmath25 in next few years @xcite .    in this study we will only consider the sizeable corrections to the coupling @xmath98 which occur at large @xmath38 in susy models .",
    "the decays of interest to us depend on the coupling @xmath6 ( @xmath99 ) and the corrections are comprised of the following @xcite :    * enhanced corrections to @xmath6 vertex diagrams * large corrections to the @xmath69 quark yukawa coupling @xmath70 @xcite ( known as the hrs effect ) * large corrections to @xmath100 @xcite , where @xmath100 in the mssm lagrangian differs from the experimentally measured @xmath101    the above corrections greatly affect other processes involving the @xmath98 coupling such as @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath33 @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the effects of these corrections on @xmath93 were covered in @xcite but the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 of interest to us were overlooked .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the combined effect of these corrections can be neatly encoded in an effective lagrangian for the @xmath102 coupling by multiplying the usual lagrangian by a factor @xmath103 ) . for our case of the decay of a @xmath104 , @xmath105 and the corresponding @xmath106",
    "is called @xmath107 in @xcite .",
    "this correction appears in @xmath68 ( eq.[rl ] ) and modifies the scaling factor of the sm rate to : @xmath108    analogous corrections of type ( i ) and ( ii ) are also present for the @xmath109 and @xmath110 couplings , but are known to be considerably smaller since there is no susy qcd contribution ( only susy electroweak contributions ) .",
    "thus we will neglect them in the present study .",
    "these corrections will be considered in a future work and are of more interest for high luminosity runs of the @xmath3 factories with data samples of @xmath111 @xmath11 mesons .",
    "note that both @xmath25 and the large corrections to the @xmath6 coupling cancel out in the ratio @xmath112 defined by : @xmath113 this quantity is predicted to be @xmath114 , which in the sm is essentially equivalent to @xmath115 .",
    "however , @xmath112 would be affected by the hrs corrections to @xmath116 and the vertex corrections to @xmath117 .",
    "in this section we discuss the numerical impact of the modification of the @xmath6 vertex on the combined bounds on @xmath38 and @xmath118 .",
    "we take the modification parameter @xmath107 as an input parameter , varying it in the interval @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "this is the range found in @xcite by explicit calculation and a scan over reasonable values of the minimum flavour violation model parameters .",
    "plane for different values of @xmath107 and @xmath25 from the experimental limit @xmath120 .",
    "the corresponding plot for the @xmath121 case looks very similar but gives slightly weaker constraints .",
    "[ exclusionplot_tau],width=491 ]    in order to show the region in the @xmath122 plane excluded by the experimental upper limits on br@xmath123 , in fig.[exclusionplot_tau ] we plot @xmath38 ( @xmath124-axis ) against @xmath118 ( @xmath125-axis ) . for a given set of input parameters ,",
    "the region above the corresponding curve is excluded .    from br@xmath126 , without the radiative corrections , ( @xmath127 ) the excluded region is simply bounded by a straight line of gradient @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) @xmath130 $ ] for @xmath79 ( @xmath131 ) mev . with the inclusion of radiative corrections at the level of @xmath132 ( 0.01 ) ,",
    "the bounds change to the lower ( upper ) set of curved lines .",
    "it can be seen that even with the present rather large uncertainty of @xmath25 of @xmath133 , the effect of the radiative corrections is much larger than that of the uncertainty of the decay constant .    with the central value of @xmath79 mev",
    ", @xmath134 gev would allow @xmath135 of up to 40 when the radiative corrections are neglected , strengthening to @xmath136 for @xmath132 and weakening to @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "the corresponding bounds from br@xmath139 are slightly weaker : @xmath140 for @xmath127 and 40 ( 66 ) for @xmath132 ( 0.01 ) ( all for @xmath79 mev , @xmath134 gev )",
    ". variations of @xmath25 have a much smaller effect . for the @xmath141 case and with @xmath134 gev ,",
    "the bound on @xmath38 changes from 40.5 ( 200 mev ) to 42.8 ( 38.6 ) for @xmath142 ( 230 ) mev .",
    "the unobserved purely leptonic decays @xmath143 and @xmath144 provide competitive constraints on the ratio @xmath5 .",
    "we have studied the effect of susy corrections at large @xmath38 and showed that the exact bounds on @xmath5 can be strengthened or weakened depending on the value of @xmath107 , the correction factor for the @xmath6 vertex due to susy loop corrections . the effect on the allowed region in the ( @xmath145 ) plane exceeds @xmath146 for @xmath147 , which is considerably larger than the analogous uncertainty of @xmath148 caused by varying the decay constant @xmath25 by @xmath149 mev .",
