    "coupled map lattices ( cml ) are dynamical systems with discrete space and time and continuous state variables .",
    "their most common form in applications is the diffusively coupled model @xmath0\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a discrete time step , @xmath2 is a lattice point with a periodic boundary condition , @xmath3 the local map , @xmath4 the coupling and @xmath5 a continuous parameter .",
    "they prove particularly useful in the investigation of chaotic dynamics of spatially extended systems ( spatiotemporal chaos ) , but have also been employed in chemical , biological and engineering modelling , as well as pattern formation . the discrete structure in space and time",
    "can either be the approximation of a less tractable continuous system ( as in turbulence ) , or may arise naturally in applications ( as in population dynamics of discrete colonies of organisms ) .",

    "give a good overview of early work to 1998 including the above applications ; recent developments include advances in the mathematics of the relevant banach spaces and transfer operators  @xcite as well as ever widening applications ; examples include ecology  @xcite , neurons  @xcite , traffic flow  @xcite cryptography  @xcite and field theory  @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of understanding the dynamics of coupled chaotic maps , the most common cml studied are where the local dynamics @xmath6 is quadratic ( the `` logistic '' map ) ; this class of one dimensional maps is now reasonably well understood .",
    "the simplest example of a quadratic map is the second degree tchebyscheff polynomial @xmath7 which is well known to be conjugated to a piecewise linear map with complete binary symbolic dynamics , and hence exactly solvable .    in this paper",
    "we consider diffusively coupled tchebyscheff maps ( see sec .",
    "2.2 for details ) of degree 2 and 3 .",
    "these have been previously used by beck @xcite in some interesting but unconfirmed ideas concerning dynamical generation of noise for stochastic quantisation leading to predictions of parameters in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "one of the authors @xcite subsequently showed that four of beck s six cml models exhibit stable synchronised time periodic states at arbitrarily small values of the coupling parameter @xmath5 , albeit with small basins of attraction .",
    "the motivation for considering these models derives not only from possible applications , but also theoretical simplicity in that the uncoupled state is fully chaotic and exactly solvable , the small coupling limit has interesting structure , and the equations ( being low degree polynomials ) allow many exact calculations .    here",
    "we apply classical periodic orbit theory @xcite to a lattice of two coupled tchebyscheff maps .",
    "this theory allows very precise computations of long time properties ( averages , lyapunov exponents , dimensions , decay of correlations , etc . ) of chaotic systems , but has been mostly restricted to low dimensional systems in the past .",
    "this paper contains the first steps towards developing a high dimensional periodic orbit theory , making use of the properties of tchebyscheff maps to locate a large number of periodic orbits .",
    "if the beck theory turns out to be true , the insight gained regarding these cml will be invaluable in developing periodic orbit based computation methods which are potentially far more precise than direct simulation , and which are required in particle physics . more generally , a periodic orbit theory of cml will allow a far greater precision and insight into the many spatiotemporal systems discussed at the beginning than is currently available using direct methods .    in order to achieve our immediate goal of computing beck s observables on a two site lattice ,",
    "we first need to look for periodic orbits of  ( [ main ] ) by using appropriate numerical methods and study some of their properties , as described in the following sections .",
    "the locations , the stability and the number of periodic orbits of such maps depend on the value of @xmath5 and current results do not allow prediction of these changes in detail . as we discuss in section 2 ,",
    "unexpected phenomena take place as soon as the coupling parameter @xmath5 is increased from 0 , for example a few periodic points suddenly move off the region @xmath8 $ ] , which we consider for our analysis . as @xmath5",
    "is increased from , periodic points drift on the domain @xmath8 $ ] , moving into the complex plane and then reappearing on the real axis as @xmath5 is increased further .",
    "the stability of periodic orbits is also heavily affected by the value of the coupling and stable and/or almost stable orbits appear for certain @xmath5 s .",
    "such behaviour has important consequences for the convergence of cycle expansions @xcite , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "in fact both the rate and the kind of convergence of any average we compute on the lattice strongly depends on the value of the coupling parameter .",
    "still in the same section we address the applications of equations  ( [ main ] ) to the theory of beck . as pointed out by one of the authors @xcite , the system  ( [ main ] ) does not show ergodicity for all values of @xmath5 , therefore direct simulation is not always guaranteed to be reliable in computing averages over the lattice .",
    "that is one reason why we investigate the efficiency of averaging over the periodic points . when it is possible to achieve a significant precision for the zeta function ( see sec .",
    "3.1 ) , we have computed the average of some string potentials defined in sec . 3.2 , and then compared the results with direct simulation on the same lattice . conclusions and outlook are presented in section 4 .",
    "the first problem is to find periodic solutions to the map  ( [ main ] ) up to the highest possible period .",
    "a number of numerical methods can be employed for that purpose . in our case",
    "the quickest one seems to be the inverse iteration method , as follows : let @xmath9 be a map whose cycles are all expanding , then it follows that its inverse @xmath10 has only stable periodic orbits , which can easily be found by iteration .",
    "a different symbol sequence ( where symbols are associated with branches of the multivalued inverse ) is to be used for every orbit @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this method can not be applied a priori , unless we are certain that the map has only expanding cycles .",
    "it turns out that the system  ( [ main ] ) has got a few periodic orbits whose jacobian has one stable and one unstable eigenvalue ( see sec 2.3 ) .",
    "this makes it impossible for inverse iteration to find them , since we can not guess initial conditions that lie right on the unstable manifold .",
    "a different approach to the problem is that to find the zeros of the equation @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the period in question .",
    "the multipoint newton s method @xcite is believed to be one of the best algorithms for that purpose .",
    "it has the advantage of converging relatively fast to the solution , provided that sufficiently accurate initial conditions are given .",
    "a cycle of period @xmath1 is a root of the vector function @xmath12 : @xmath13 the iteration we need in order to approach the roots has the form @xmath14^{-1 } f(x)\\ ] ] therefore , after a certain number of iterations we expect to find one root .",
    "of course the method has to be performed every time with different initial conditions , until we are sure all the solutions have been found .",
    "the issue concerning the choice of initial conditions is a delicate one , because in principle it is difficult to guess the initial points on a 2-dimensional plane accurately .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to remember that we are dealing with weakly coupled maps ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "for that reason we expect the periodic points to be relatively close to those of the uncoupled system ( @xmath16 ) , that can be found analytically ( see sec .",
    "2.2 ) and hence exactly .",
    "( 200,200 ) ( 0,150 ) ( 180,150 )      the spatially uncoupled dynamics of tchebyscheff maps is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19th tchebyscheff polynomial , defined in general as @xmath20 of which we consider the first two , namely @xmath21 @xmath22 the general ( coupled ) tchebyscheff maps have the form @xmath23 where @xmath5 is the string coupling parameter , @xmath24 can be @xmath25 and @xmath26 can take on the values 1 and 0 , determining respectively advanced coupling ( @xmath27 , `` a '' ) or backward coupling ( @xmath28 , `` b '' ) .",
    "we have then six models @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the other two @xmath35 maps are equivalent to these by a trivial symmetry .    the model  ( [ main ] ) , becomes @xmath36 on a two site lattice . in this section we consider the uncoupled case @xmath16 , in which the system  ( [ sys1],[sys2 ] ) reduces to @xmath37 this is useful as there is a close correspondence between orbits at @xmath16 and orbits with @xmath38 .",
    "this correspondence is used to find orbits in the coupled dynamics using the uncoupled orbits as starting points for the multipoint newton algorithm .",
    "the correspondence is not exact  the @xmath39 degree polynomial equation giving the periodic condition always has this number of ( possibly degenerate ) solutions , however for @xmath38 some of these solutions are not in the range @xmath40 $ ] or are complex , and hence not relevant to the dynamics .",
    "this is discussed further in the next section .",
    "we begin first with some definitions .",
    "a _ periodic point _ of length @xmath41 is a solution of @xmath42 ; as discussed above , there are at most @xmath39 of them .",
    "a _ periodic orbit _ is the orbit @xmath43 of a periodic point .",
    "prime orbit _ is a periodic orbit which is not the repeat of a shorter orbit , that is , @xmath44 only if @xmath45 is a multiple of @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath46 is a periodic point of length @xmath41 of the uncoupled system if and only if @xmath47 and @xmath48 are both periodic points of length @xmath41 of the map @xmath18 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the @xmath18 maps are conjugate to piecewise linear maps with complete @xmath19-ary symbolic dynamics , by the transformation @xmath49 .",
    "this leads to exact expressions for all the periodic points of length @xmath41 , namely @xmath50 $ ] with @xmath51 .",
    "from these we enumerate all the prime orbits of the uncoupled two dimensional dynamics , eliminating cyclic permutations which correspond to points on the same orbit , and repeats of shorter orbits .    as an example we consider @xmath52 .",
    "let symbol 0 ( 1 ) denote @xmath53 $ ] ( respectively @xmath54 $ ] ) ; in general there are @xmath19 symbols . in the symbolic representation of periodic points , the spatial variable ( @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) will increase to the right , and the temporal variable ( @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) will increase downwards .",
    "the periodic points of the one dimensional map are @xmath55 leading to 16 periodic points in the two dimensional map , classified as six prime orbits @xmath56 their cyclic permutations @xmath57 and four repeated period one orbits @xmath58      until now we have not considered the symmetry of the system .",
    "this is particularly important for cycle expansions @xcite , for which a correct treatment of symmetry significantly accelerates convergence of the expansions .",
    "an uncoupled lattice has symmetry group @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of lattice sites ( equal to two in this paper ) , @xmath61 is the symmetric group , of order @xmath62 , corresponding to permutations of the lattice points , and @xmath63 is the symmetry group of the dynamics .",
    "a symmetrically coupled lattice with @xmath64 has symmetry group @xmath65 , the dihedral group , of order @xmath66 , corresponding to spatial cyclic permutations and reflections of the lattice sites . in the case",
    "@xmath67 the cyclic shift and reflection are equivalent , so the group is @xmath68 , the cyclic group .",
    "remnants of the internal symmetry group @xmath63 may or may not survive , depending on the nature of the coupling . for @xmath69",
    "the coupling breaks the permutation symmetry , reducing the order of the symmetry group ( ignoring internal symmetries ) , from @xmath62 to @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "each symmetry operation permutes periodic points .",
    "if the image of a periodic point lies in the same periodic orbit , that orbit is called symmetric , and is invariant under a cyclic subgroup of symmetry operations .",
    "if it does not , the new orbit is equivalent to the first under the symmetry , and shares many of the same properties , in particular stability and averages invariant under the symmetry .",
    "it is also possible for a periodic point to be a fixed point of the symmetry transformation , in which case its orbit is called a boundary orbit . in the presence of symmetry , the best strategy is desymmetrisation , in which all images of a phase space point are considered equivalent , and so may be described by a representative point on a subset of the original phase space called the fundamental domain .",
    "equivalent orbits in the full dynamics correspond to a single orbit in the desymmetrised dynamics , and symmetric orbits in the full dynamics correspond to repeats of shorter orbits in the desymmetrised dynamics .",
    "thus the enumeration of prime orbits up to a given period in the desymmetrised dynamics contains much more information than the enumeration up to the same period in the original dynamics , hence the accelerated convergence of cycle expansions .",
    "we continue with the previous example , considering the @xmath70 maps , which have no internal symmetry .",
    "thus the symmetry group is the cyclic group @xmath68 , with the nontrivial element corresponding to @xmath71 .",
    "the fundamental domain can be taken as @xmath72 , from which the full domain is obtained by taking symmetry operations .",
    "the boundary satisfies @xmath73 .",
    "now the prime orbits of period two in the desymmetrised dynamics are classified as follows .",
    "there are two asymmetric orbits of period two in the original dynamics , @xmath74 one boundary orbit of original period two @xmath75 and three symmetric orbits of original period four @xmath76 note that the total number ( six ) is the same , but the information content is higher , since all the original period two orbits are included as period one or two , and also some orbits of original period four .    in the case",
    "@xmath35 , the symmetry group of the interacting case is @xmath77 , since there is an internal symmetry @xmath78 , which in the coupled map survives as @xmath79 .",
    "this is in addition to the permutation @xmath71 .",
    "thus the fundamental domain can be taken as @xmath80 .",
    "orbits may now be classified as asymmetric , symmetric under @xmath71 , symmetric under @xmath79 , symmetric under @xmath81 , boundary with @xmath73 , boundary with @xmath82 and ( if it occurs ) boundary with @xmath83 .      in this section",
    "we illustrate the behaviour of the @xmath18 map periodic solutions when the coupling parameter @xmath5 is in the range @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "in particular , we describe two phenomena , that is the way and stability and number of cycles change with @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath90 is said to be stable when @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath16 , the systems is uncoupled and the @xmath18 maps have no stable cycles . since the eigenvalues are continuous functions of @xmath5 , we expect no stable eigenvalue to show up for very small @xmath5 at fixed orbit period . as for stability , we analyse the trend of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues found for each period . in general , we consider the product @xmath92 so that in the 2-d case it is either @xmath93 or just the unstable @xmath90 .",
    "stable orbits are not used for cycle expansions , hence they are not considered for this analysis .",
    "the graphs in figure  [ f : trend1 ] show that both the maximum and the minimum eigenvalues increase hyperbolically ( i.e. exponentially ) with respect to the period @xmath41 of the cycles when @xmath16 and still up to @xmath94 , but the trend of the minimum @xmath90 s changes as long as @xmath5 grows , so that their increase gets slower and slower .",
    "besides , as we will explain later in this section , the few cycles with @xmath95 move off the fundamental domain when @xmath96 , so that the maximum eigenvalues take the form @xmath97 . coupled maps where the maximum @xmath98 is @xmath99 when @xmath16 and @xmath100 or lower otherwise .",
    "] when @xmath101 , the minimum eigenvalues are perhaps best fitted by a power law , rather than an exponential .",
    "such a behaviour is common to all the coupled @xmath102 and @xmath103 maps .",
    "figure  [ f : trend1 ] also shows that the trend of the minimum @xmath90 s also gets less and less smooth , as @xmath5 increases .",
    "this phenomenon , together with the loss of hyperbolicity for some @xmath104 , dramatically slows down the convergence of cycle expansions , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "( 500,500 ) ( 50,500 ) ( 50,330 ) ( 50,160 )    figure  [ f : trend2 ] shows the trend of the eigenvalues in the @xmath32 map when @xmath101 .",
    "( 150,150 ) ( 50,150 )    as we can see , it is very difficult to make a good fit for the trend of the minimum @xmath98 s in this case , because all the coupled @xmath102 ( and @xmath103 ) maps have got almost stable cycles for such @xmath5 s , including some at high period .",
    "it is interesting to compare this behaviour with what happens with intermittent @xmath105 maps @xcite .",
    "the other interesting issue we analyse is whether and why the number of cycles of a coupled map for a fixed period varies as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath5 .",
    "numerical simulation shows that few periodic orbits of the uncoupled map  ( [ uncoupled ] ) move off the fundamental domain when the system is coupled ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "moreover , the number of @xmath106 cycles continues to decrease as @xmath5 grows , because some periodic solutions of the set  ( [ sys1],[sys2 ] ) become complex or degenerate for certain values of @xmath5 , so that most of the missing orbits have just disappeared into the complex plane .",

    "figure  [ f : sinking ] shows good agreement of the @xmath116 fitting function with the data for very weak coupling ( @xmath119 ) while a slight deviation for larger @xmath5 .",
    "this deviation is not unexpected , since this form for the topological entropy is only an approximate expression in the small coupling limit .",
    "of course a detailed investigation could reveal that the topological entropy is not smooth in fine detail , however this form is remarkably accurate for practical purposes .",

    "that is one reason why we use cycle expansions , which are potentially far more precise .",
    "according to periodic orbit theory @xcite , the average of @xmath121 can be found by computing the dynamical zeta function @xmath122 where @xmath123 @xmath6 is the map in question , @xmath124 is a parameter , @xmath125 the eigenvalue of the cycle @xmath126 and @xmath1 is the orbit period .",
    "the uncertain digit in the average is obtained by comparing results from the computation of  ( [ zeta ] ) up to the two largest periods ( for example 10 and 11 ) .",
    "it is possible to check the rate of convergence of the zeta function by setting @xmath127 and @xmath128 and computing @xmath129 , which should approach zero .",
    "this way we can have an idea of how effective our cycle expansion is and whether longer cycles are needed .",

    "the accuracy of @xmath131 is particularly affected towards @xmath101 , where longer cycles or stability ordering may be needed .",
    "ordering by stability means to expand the zeta function keeping all terms whose period and stability are less than a given cutoff ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "this scheme is usually preferred to length ordering in case of intermittency or bad symbolic dynamics grammar @xcite , but it hasnt been attempted here since it would need much a higher period of truncation for the cycle expansion and , as a consequence , impractical cpu times .",
    "a full resolution would require understanding which orbits are close to stability , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "anyway the behaviour shown in figure  [ f : zeta ] traces back to the trend of the minimum eigenvalues of the cycles ( sec .",
    "2.3 ) , since we can see from equation ( [ zeta ] ) that the smaller @xmath98 s are more relevant in the computation of the zeta function .",
    "that means that if their trend is exponential with respect to increasing @xmath5 s , the @xmath133 s are smaller and smaller as @xmath129 approaches zero .",
    "otherwise the convergence gets more complicated .",
    "the expansion for the @xmath103 maps has been truncated at period @xmath134 , yet the precision obtained is comparable with what we have got in the @xmath102 maps .",
    "that is because @xmath135 , meaning a similar number of periodic points and hence more or less the same number of terms in the two expansions .",

    "3 .   there are points where both cycle expansion and direct simulation are offset .",

    "<S> coupled map lattices have been widely used as models in several fields of physics , such as chaotic strings , turbulence , and phase transitions , as well as in other disciplines , such as biology ( ecology , evolution ) and information processing . </S>",
    "<S> this paper investigates properties of periodic orbits in two coupled tchebyscheff maps . </S>",
    "<S> then zeta function cycle expansions are used to compute dynamical averages appearing in beck s theory of chaotic strings . </S>",
    "<S> the results show close agreement with direct simulation for most values of the coupling parameter , and yield information about the system complementary to that of direct simulation . </S>"
