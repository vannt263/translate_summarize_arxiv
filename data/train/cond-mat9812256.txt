    "a few theories for high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors are based on the presence of a quantum critical point ( @xmath5 ) of some kind of instability in the phase diagram of these materials .",
    "the different realizations of this scenario proposed so far involve ( @xmath6 ) an antiferromagnetic ( @xmath7)-@xmath5 @xcite , ( @xmath8 ) a charge - transfer instability @xcite , ( @xmath9 ) an `` as - yet unidentified '' @xmath5 regulating a first - order phase - transition between the @xmath7 state and the superconducting @xmath10 state @xcite , ( @xmath11 ) an incommensurate charge - density - wave ( @xmath12)-@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the theories based on the @xmath7-@xmath5 @xcite are motivated by the presence of an @xmath7 phase at low doping and by the observation of strong spin fluctuations at larger doping @xcite .",
    "however near and above optimum doping it is likely that charge degrees of freedom play a major role , whereas spin degrees of freedom _ follow _ the charge dynamics , and are enslaved by the charge instability controlled by the @xmath12-@xmath5@xcite , as suggested also by the experiments in @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the strong interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom extends the spin fluctuations to a region far away from the @xmath7-@xmath5 and gives rise to a `` stripe phase '' which continuously connects the onset of the charge instability ( @xmath12-@xmath5 ) at high doping with the low - doping regime , where mobile holes , expelled by the @xmath7 background , may form fluctuating stripes with marked one dimensional character @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall more properly refer to the @xmath12-@xmath5 as the stripe-@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath5 and the stripe-@xmath5 are not alternative and they control the behaviour of the system in different regions of doping . on the other hand",
    "the existence of a stripe-@xmath5 at optimum doping , where no other energy scale besides the temperature is present in transport measurements @xcite , is the natural explanation for the peculiar nature of this doping regime in the phase diagram of superconducting copper oxides .",
    "indeed the critical fluctuations near a @xmath5 provide a singular electron - electron ( @xmath14-@xmath14 ) interaction which may account for both the violation of the fermi liquid ( @xmath15 ) behaviour in the metallic state and the high superconducting critical temperature @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the outcomes of the stripe-@xmath5 scenario with respect to the single particle excitation spectra in the normal state and the symmetry of the gap parameter in the superconducting state and we compare our results with the corresponding experiments , as discussed below .",
    "the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( @xmath16 ) , mainly performed on @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , is providing new evidence for an anomalous metallic state in the under- and optimally doped region of the phase diagram of high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors .",
    "the single - particle excitation spectra show features which can not be described within the conventional fermi liquid theory .",
    "the underdoped region is characterized by the opening of a pseudogap around the @xmath0 points of the brillouin zone ( @xmath19 ) below a crossover temperature @xmath20 , which seems to evolve into the superconducting gap at the critical temperature @xmath4 @xcite . at the same time and in the same region of the @xmath19 ,",
    "the quasiparticle peaks in the energy distribution curves have a rather low spectral intensity and are very broad , even near the leading edge . at optimum doping , where the pseudogap disappears ,",
    "a strong suppression of low - laying spectral weight around the @xmath0 points is still present @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the recently developed angular scanning photoemission spectroscopy provides a detailed picture of the @xmath21-space distribution of spectral weight near the fermi level and shows that the suppression around the @xmath0 points is asymmetric @xcite .",
    "the energy distribution curves are characterized by the presence of dispersive peaks of incoherent nature besides the quasiparticle peak @xcite .    in the superconducting state",
    ", the gap parameter has a peculiar doping and temperature dependence . in the under- and optimally doped region of the phase diagram , @xmath16 measurements on @xmath18 @xcite and on @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) @xcite have shown that the magnitude of the superconducting gap parameter is strongly momentum dependent in agreement with a @xmath1-wave or a strongly anisotropic @xmath3-wave gap .",
    "several phase - sensitive measurements on @xmath23 , involving currents flowing within the @xmath24 planes @xcite , together with temperature dependent penetration depth measurements @xcite , provide evidence for primarily @xmath1-wave gap . on the other hand @xmath25-axis josephson tunneling experiments , and in particular the measurements where",
    "a conventional @xmath3-wave superconductor ( @xmath26 ) is deposited across a single twin boundary of @xmath23 twinned crystal , show that the gap has a sizeable @xmath3-wave component @xcite .    in overdoped @xmath18 @xmath16 experiments , out of the experimental error ,",
    "detect a finite value of the gap @xcite , hence the gap can not have @xmath2-wave symmetry .",
    "the measured anisotropic ratio @xmath27 is a decreasing function of the doping , having @xmath28 near optimal doping , compatible with @xmath2-wave gap , and @xmath29 at overdoping , compatible with anisotropic @xmath3-wave gap . in the same range of doping ,",
    "the topology of the @xmath30 , including the saddle points , does not change significantly @xcite .",
    "we take this as an indication that the strong doping dependence of the gap parameter comes from a corresponding strong doping dependence of the @xmath14-@xmath14 effective interaction .",
    "we study the single - particle excitation spectra of the metallic phase in the vicinity of the stripe-@xmath5 .",
    "the charge @xmath31 and ( enslaved ) spin ( @xmath3 ) fluctuations near the @xmath5 , mediate an effective electron - electron interaction , which in the random phase approximation can be written as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a damping coefficient and @xmath34 $ ] is taken in the cos - like form to reproduce the @xmath35 behaviour close to the wave - vector @xmath36 of the critical charge and spin fluctuations , and to maintain the lattice periodicity near the zone boundary . the distance from criticality",
    "is measured by the inverse squared of the correlation length @xmath37 $ ] ; we locate the stripe-@xmath5 at a hole doping @xmath38 .",
    "the form ( [ eff ] ) for the effective interaction , mediated by charge fluctuations , was found within a slave - boson approach to the hubbard - holstein model with long - range coulomb interaction , close to the charge instability @xcite .",
    "the same form , mediated by spin fluctuations , corresponds to the phenomenological susceptibility proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to fit nmr and neutron scattering experiments , in the strongly damped limit .",
    "the condition that charge fluctuations enslave spin fluctuations near the stripe-@xmath5 is introduced , within our model , by requiring that the vanishing of @xmath39 drives @xmath40 to zero .",
    "the bare electron dispersion law is taken in the form @xmath41 where nearest - neighbour ( @xmath42 ) and next - to - nearest - neighbour ( @xmath43 ) hopping terms are considered , to reproduce the main features of the band dispersion and the @xmath30 observed in high-@xmath4 materials .",
    "we choose @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , and @xmath46 mev , corresponding to a hole doping @xmath47 with respect to half filling , as appropriate for @xmath18 at optimal doping .    aiming to capture the essential aspects of the single - particle excitation spectra",
    ", we calculate the electron self - energy within perturbation theory , considering the first - order contribution @xmath48",
    ". the imaginary part of the self - energy is @xmath49 [ \\varepsilon -\\xi(k ' ) ] \\over [ \\varepsilon -\\xi(k')]^2 + \\gamma_i^{-2 } [ \\kappa_i^2+\\omega_i^2(k - k')]^2 } , \\label{imsigma}\\ ] ] where the integral is extended over the @xmath19 , @xmath50 is the fermi function and @xmath51 is the bose function . the real part of the self - energy @xmath52 is obtained by a kramers - kr \" onig transformation of ( [ imsigma ] ) . to preserve the inversion symmetry @xmath53 in the resulting quasiparticle spectra , we symmetrize the self - energies @xmath54 with respect to @xmath55 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath56 , neglecting the possibility for a discommensuration of the spin fluctuations in a ( dynamical ) stripe phase @xcite , which would introduce minor changes to the resulting self - energy .",
    "the direction and the magnitude of the critical wave - vector @xmath57 are not universal .",
    "they depend on both the material @xcite and the model @xcite . to discuss the @xmath16 experiments , which are mainly performed on @xmath18 samples",
    ", we consider this material and we take @xmath58 as it is suggested by the analysis of the experimental results @xcite . the other parameters appearing in the effective interaction ( [ eff ] ) are taken as @xmath59 ev , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ev@xmath62 .",
    "we focus on the quantum critical region near optimal doping , where the only energy scale is the temperature ( @xmath63 ) and a strong violation of the fermi - liquid behaviour in the metallic phase is found .    to study the effect of the singular interaction ( [ eff ] ) on the single - particle properties in the metallic phase we calculate the spectral density @xmath64 ^ 2+[{\\rm im}\\sigma ( k,\\varepsilon)]^2 \\}$ ] .",
    "the chemical potential is self - consistently corrected by a term @xmath65 to keep the number of particles fixed . to simulate the experimental conditions in @xmath16 measurements we introduce the convoluted spectral density @xmath66 which takes care of the absence of occupied states above the fermi energy , through the fermi function @xmath50 , and of the experimental energy resolution @xmath67 , through a resolution function @xmath68 .",
    "we take @xmath69 or @xmath70/2r$ ] according to numerical convenience .",
    "the quasiparticle spectra are characterized by a coherent quasiparticle peak at an energy @xmath71 and by shadow resonances at energies @xmath72 , produced by the interaction with charge and spin fluctuations .",
    "the shadow peaks do not generally correspond to new poles in the electron green function and are essentially incoherent , although they _ follow _ the dispersion of the shadow bands .",
    "their intensity varies strongly with @xmath21 and increases as @xmath73 approaches the value @xmath74 .",
    "in particular at the hot spots , where @xmath75 there is a suppression of the coherent spectral weight near the fermi level due to the strong scattering . in fig . [ fs ] , on the right panel , we plot the energy distribution curves obtained along the direction @xmath76 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the quasiparticle peak moves from the left to the right towards the fermi level as the momentum is increased .",
    "it interferes with a shadow resonance associated with @xmath57 , which appears in the third to seventh curves .",
    "this resonance moves initially to the left and then to the right , approaching the fermi level .",
    "the effect of spin fluctuations is visible only near the @xmath0 point , where a broad resonance appears below the fermi energy and is located at @xmath77 mev at the @xmath0 point in fig .",
    "[ fs ] .",
    "we also study the @xmath21-distribution of low - laying spectral weight @xmath78 .",
    "this distribution is more appropriate than the standard definition of the @xmath30 in terms of quasiparticles , @xmath79 , in the presence of incoherent spectral weight near the fermi level .",
    "indeed , the transfer of the spectral weight from the main @xmath30 to the different branches of the shadow @xmath30 at @xmath80 produces features which are characteristic of the interaction with charge and spin fluctuations and of their interplay .",
    "in particular the symmetric suppression of spectral weight near the @xmath0 points of the @xmath19 , which would be due to spin fluctuations alone , is modulated by charge fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ fs ] , left panel ) .",
    "this is also the case for the ( weak ) hole pockets produced by spin fluctuations around the points @xmath81 .",
    "the interference with the branches of the shadow @xmath30 due to charge fluctuations enhances these pockets around @xmath82 and suppresses them around @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ fs ] , left panel ) .",
    "experimental results on this issue are controversial .",
    "strong shadow peaks in the diagonal directions , giving rise to hole pockets in the @xmath30 , have been reported in the literature @xcite , where other experiments found only weak ( or even absent ) features @xcite .",
    "we point out that , because of the transfer of spectral weight to the shadow @xmath30 , the experimentally observed @xmath30 may be rather different from the quasiparticle @xmath30 .",
    "the observed evolution could , indeed , be associated with the change in the distribution of the low - laying spectral weight , without any dramatic change in the topology of the quasiparticle @xmath30 , as was instead suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we interpret the suppression of portions of the @xmath30 as the onset of a pseudogap regime in the underdoped region .",
    "we attribute the pseudogap formation to the strong pairing associated with the singular @xmath14-@xmath14 effective interaction in the cooper channel ( see below , eq .",
    "[ cooper ] ) . according to the scenario discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the local gap formation should stabilize the system against the true static charge ordering . the self - consistent interplay of the various effects",
    "should be considered within a more refined model .",
    "recent @xmath16 experiments indicate a crossover between @xmath2-wave and @xmath3-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap parameter driven by the increasing doping @xcite . in order to describe theoretically the change of the symmetry of the gap parameter in the presence of an almost unchanged @xmath30 , the effective electron - electron ( @xmath14-@xmath14 ) interaction has to be doping dependent .",
    "this is the case for the effective interaction which arises near the stripe-@xmath5 @xcite . in a first approximation we consider the @xmath14-@xmath14 effective interaction in the cooper channel as a sum of the spin and charge fluctuation contributions coupled to fermions    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are defined in formula ( [ eff ] ) , which gives the effective @xmath14-@xmath14 interaction in the particle - hole channel . note that the spin fluctuations contribute with a different sign in the @xmath87-@xmath87 and @xmath87-@xmath88 channels .    in the under- and optimally doped region ,",
    "the pairing is due to the interplay between critical charge fluctuations , providing in the small @xmath89 limit an attraction in both @xmath2-wave and @xmath3-wave channels , and spin fluctuations providing attraction only in the @xmath2-wave channel , being repulsive in the @xmath3-wave channel .",
    "indeed small @xmath89 interactions couple mainly nearby states in momentum space which have the same sign of the @xmath1-wave symmetry factor ( @xmath90 ) , preserving the attractive nature of the interaction .",
    "we point out that the effective interaction mediated by charge fluctuations includes , besides the small @xmath89 attraction , a residual repulsive term at large @xmath89 , as it was shown in refs .",
    "however in our calculation this repulsion is accounted for by the interaction mediated by spin fluctuation .",
    "when both are considered , the @xmath1-wave gap parameter is enhanced by the cooperative effects of charge and spin fluctuations up to optimal doping @xcite .    in the overdoped region",
    "it is likely that the spin fluctuations are strongly reduced , as suggested by the decrease of the antiferromagnetic correlation length at high doping @xcite . in this region of the phase",
    "diagram the charge fluctuations are dominant and the gap parameter may be @xmath3- or @xmath2-wave , depending on the strength of the residual repulsion in the effective interaction .",
    "this crossover appears as a possibility in our model and indeed may or may not occur depending on the values of the parameters of the effective interaction as a function of doping .",
    "a dominant role of spin degrees of freedom at low doping and of charge degrees of freedom at higher doping in the pairing mechanism was also proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the three - band @xmath42-j-@xmath91 model .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the variation with doping of the charge instability vector @xmath57 is another possible mechanism to induce a symmetry crossover .",
    "when @xmath57 is less or of the same order of @xmath92 ( around @xmath0 points ) the gap has a @xmath1-wave symmetry , since the interaction is characterized by small transferred momenta , whereas for @xmath57 substantially greater than @xmath92 the gap has an anisotropic @xmath3-wave structure . in this last case",
    "the @xmath1-wave gap is strongly depressed because the large @xmath89 interaction couples states with opposite sign of the corresponding symmetry factor , changing the attractive contribution into a repulsive one . in the cuprates these two mechanisms",
    "could coexist .    in the overdoped region , where we assume that @xmath93 is sufficiently large , the @xmath89 dependence of the effective interaction in the spin channel introduces minor correction with respect to the dominant term @xmath94 .",
    "the relevant contribution of @xmath86 to the effective interaction ( [ cooper ] ) is given by    @xmath95    thus , to simplify the discussion , we use in the following an effective interaction    @xmath96    within this approximation the contribution of the spin channel to the effective interaction ( [ cooper ] ) has the same effects as a residual repulsive interaction in the charge channel . in order to evaluate the symmetry and the momentum dependence of the superconducting gap",
    ", we consider the static part of the effective interaction given by @xmath97 , and we solve the @xmath98 equation for the gap parameter @xmath99 .",
    "the numerical value of the gap , obtained in the @xmath98 approach , is only indicative because it is influenced by strong - coupling self - energy and non - adiabatic vertex corrections which have to be included in a complete generalized eliashberg approach @xcite .",
    "the @xmath98 equation is given by    @xmath100    where @xmath101 , and the bare electron dispersion @xmath102 is a tight binding fit of the @xmath18 @xmath30 measured by @xmath16 at optimum doping @xcite .",
    "the @xmath98 equation is numerically solved taking advantage of the fast fourier transform , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    due to the qualitative character of the following discussion ,",
    "we choose here a direction for the characteristic wave - vector @xmath57 which emphasizes the @xmath2- vs @xmath3-wave crossover , and we take @xmath103 along the @xmath76 direction . we consider a small mass term @xmath104 , pushing the system into the momentum decoupling regime @xcite .    in fig.[crossover ]",
    "we report the condensation energy per particle as a function of @xmath105 for fixed @xmath106 for both the @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave symmetry : for @xmath107 ( up to optimum doping ) the superconducting ground state has @xmath1-wave symmetry while for @xmath108 ( which should correspond to the overdoped case ) the symmetry is @xmath3-wave .",
    "the @xmath3-wave gap parameter , obtained for small values of @xmath109 , @xmath110 large doping , has an anisotropic momentum dependence along the @xmath30 ( fig.[swave ] ) .",
    "the @xmath3-wave gap parameter , normalized to its maximum value @xmath111 , is plotted as a function of the angle @xmath112 which specifies the position of the fermi momentum @xmath113 on the @xmath30 with respect to the center of the closed @xmath30 for holes , which is located at the point @xmath114 .",
    "the anisotropic ratio @xmath115 is a function of @xmath109 , at fixed @xmath116 and @xmath103 .",
    "we find @xmath117 for @xmath118 , @xmath119 for @xmath120 ( where @xmath121 is the crossover value between @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave symmetry ) and @xmath122 for @xmath123 giving a decreasing anisotropy for decreasing @xmath109 , which corresponds to increasing doping , in agreement with the trend observed in @xmath16 experiments @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that from fig.[crossover ] , the transition from @xmath2- to @xmath3-wave superconductivity occurs at a @xmath124 ratio , where the anisotropy ratio @xmath125 is rather small .",
    "therefore , at least for the ( reasonable ) parameters considered here , the @xmath2- to @xmath3-wave transition would be characterized by a rather abrupt decrease of anisotropy .",
    "this expectation could be tested experimentally by a detailed @xmath16 analysis at closely spaced fillings .",
    "in this paper we have briefly described the stripe-@xmath5 scenario and reported some of its consequences in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "coming from the high doping regime , the occurrence of a charge - ordering instability towards a stripe phase , which is masked by the onset of a superconducting phase , provides the mechanism which controls the physics of the cuprates .",
    "it gives rise to the non - fermi liquid properties of the normal phase , to some features found in @xmath16 experiments , and to the strong pairing interaction leading to @xmath2-wave superconductivity .",
    "the main additional results of this paper concern the shape of the fermi surface in the proximity of the stripe-@xmath5 and the symmetry of the superconducting gap , in comparison with the @xmath16 experiments on optimally @xcite and over- doped @xmath18 @xcite .    by considering in our model a diagonal charge instability vector @xmath126 , as suggested by the experiments @xcite , we reproduce the asymmetrical spectral weight suppression around the @xmath0 points observed in the normal state . we also describe the occurrence of shadow resonances in the energy distribution curves , which appear in addition to the quasiparticle peaks as a result of the interaction of the fermions with charge and spin quasicritical fluctuations .    in the superconducting state",
    "we obtain a @xmath1-wave gap parameter in a wide range of parameters and we show that , within our scenario , it is possible to produce a @xmath2- @xmath127 @xmath3-wave gap symmetry crossover , and a reduction of the anisotropy of the @xmath3-wave gap with increasing doping , depending on the evolution of the parameters entering the effective interaction , as a function of doping .",
    "the main mechanisms which stabilize the anisotropic @xmath3-wave gap parameter , leading to the symmetry crossover , are the reduction of the residual repulsion and/or the increase of the charge instability vector @xmath57 upon doping .",
    "a similar crossover was recently reported in @xmath16 experiments on overdoped @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "further experimental investigations are required to confirm a doping dependent crossover and to have a feedback on the theory .",
