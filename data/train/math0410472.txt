    "let @xmath0 be a connected semisimple group over @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    "it is proven that if @xmath0 is adjoint of type @xmath2 then wonderful @xmath0-varieties are classified by means of discrete invariants coming from the theory of spherical varieties .",
    "these invariants are treated as combinatorial objects called _ spherical systems_.    in this work we extend this result to the case where @xmath0 has simple components of type @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "wonderful varieties were studied at first in the theory of linear algebraic groups as compactifications of certain homogeneous spaces , precisely the symmetric ones ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "they also appear in the theory of spherical embeddings , as `` canonical '' compactifications of particular spherical homogeneous spaces .",
    "actually all wonderful varieties can be obtained in this way ( @xcite ) .",
    "wonderful varieties of low rank have been classified for all @xmath0 , by ahiezer ( rank @xmath4 , in the framework of compact groups , also obtained with algebraic methods by brion ) and wasserman ( rank @xmath5 ) .",
    "their results have been crucial in establishing the axioms defining the spherical systems .",
    "the role of wonderful varieties within the theory of spherical varieties has been made clear in @xcite and @xcite ; their importance has grown up to the point that the classification obtained in @xcite and in the present work implies the classification of all spherical @xmath0-varieties for the groups @xmath0 under consideration .",
    "we also prove for these groups a known conjecture of brion ( appeared in @xcite ) , already proven by luna in @xcite for @xmath0 of type @xmath2 , which states that the embedding of demazure is smooth .",
    "we are grateful to d.  luna and c.  procesi for their precious help .",
    "we recall some basic definitions and known facts about wonderful and spherical varieties .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complex semisimple linear algebraic group , @xmath6 and @xmath7 two mutually opposite borel subgroups , and @xmath8 a maximal torus .",
    "an algebraic @xmath0-variety @xmath9 is _ wonderful _ of rank @xmath10 if :    * @xmath9 is smooth and complete , * @xmath0 has a dense orbit in @xmath9 whose complement is the union of @xmath10 smooth prime divisors @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with normal crossings , * the intersection of the divisors @xmath11 is nonempty and , for all @xmath13 , @xmath14 is a @xmath0-orbit .",
    "a wonderful @xmath0-variety is always projective and _ spherical _ ( see @xcite ) , where in general an irreducible @xmath0-variety @xmath9 is said to be spherical if it is normal and it contains an open dense @xmath6-orbit .",
    "this implies that any @xmath6-proper rational function on @xmath9 is uniquely determined ( up to a scalar factor ) by its @xmath6-weight ; the lattice of such weights is called @xmath15",

    "is identified with a subset of @xmath26 , and it turns out to be a polyhedral convex cone .",
    "this cone can be described as the set @xmath27 for a uniquely determined set @xmath28 of indecomposable elements of @xmath15 called the _ spherical roots _ of @xmath9 .",

    "the stabilizer in @xmath0 of the union of all colours is a parabolic subgroup containing @xmath6 denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "a subgroup @xmath36 of @xmath0 is _ spherical _ if @xmath37 is a spherical @xmath0-variety under the action of left multiplication , and it is _ wonderful _ if @xmath37 admits an embedding which is a wonderful variety .",
    "if @xmath36 is wonderful then @xmath36 necessarily has finite index in @xmath38 and the wonderful embedding of @xmath37 is unique .",
    "moreover , if a spherical subgroup @xmath36 is equal to @xmath38 then it is wonderful ( @xcite ) .      if @xmath9 is a wonderful variety , the set of its spherical roots @xmath39 is a basis of @xmath15 . in this",
    "setting one can also retrieve @xmath39 in the following way : let @xmath40 be the unique fixed point of @xmath7 and consider the orbit @xmath41 which is the unique closed orbit in @xmath9 .",
