    "radiative supernova remnants are the ideal astrophysical laboratory for studying the emission spectrum of relatively fast shocks interacting with the interstellar medium ( e.g. draine & mckee @xcite ) . in the standard , idealized , view the supernova blast wave expands through a uniform , low density ( @xmath51 @xmath6 ) medium and the shock remains adiabatic , i.e. the postshock gas has insufficient time to cool / recombine , for @xmath7 yr and up until the shock has slowed to @xmath8 km / s .",
    "after this the shock becomes radiative with the postshock region recombining and radiating away most of the shock mechanical energy in the form of uv , optical and ir lines whose surface brightness simply scale with the shock energy flux @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the pre  shock density . in practice ,",
    "a ` standard ' radiative supernova remnant is expected to emit weak lines , i.e. @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 sr@xmath13 ( cf .",

    "1989 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "this simple fact indicates , therefore , that the shock of rcw103 is much faster or , equivalently , that the snr is much younger than the canonical values .",

    "the large surface brightness of the emitted line spectrum simply reflects the large mechanical energy flux of the shock .",
    "studying the ir spectrum of radiative shocks can give interesting information on the metal abundances and , by comparing refractory and non  refractory species , can yield a direct measurement of the actual efficiency of grain destruction by the shock .",
    "moreover , the spectra can be used to verify the predictions of models of fast shocks , which have been recently published by @xcite .",

    "the [ neiii ] line , on the contrary , could be strongly enhanced by emission from photoionized gas in the post  shock region , but this only occurs at @xmath65 km / s while slower shocks do not produce enough ionizing photons to support a large neiii zone . in short , the sharp decrease of [ nev]/[neiii ] between 200 and 300 km / s is because the [ neiii ] line emission rapidly increases in this velocity interval .",

    "given the importance that the photoionized precursor may have in modelling the spectra of active galaxy nuclei ( sect .",

    "for h@xmath24 to exist , the molecules must be shielded from the strong field of uv ionizing radiation from the shock front or , equivalently , the preshock region must be optically thick . +  the shock front in rcw103 is significantly slower than so far assumed and below @xmath3150 km / s , the minimum speed required to produce a prominent phototoionized precursor .",
    "this is in strict constrast with the observed line widths and filament dynamics ( cf .",

    "moreover , slow shocks can not explain the very large surface brightness of the lines which require a large mechanical power of the shock , i.e. a large @xmath9 product , @xmath10 being the preshock density and @xmath66 the shock speed .",

    "according to the shock models of @xcite , the precursor could be an important source of lines from high ionization species ( e.g. [ oiii]5007 ) , but its importance relative to the post  shock region may strongly depend on the column density of the pre  shock material . in a paper specifically dedicated to study the spectral signatures of shocks in active galaxies , dopita & sutherland ( @xcite )",

    "consequently , the emerging line spectrum is similar to that of standard photoionization models and could explain , therefore , the high excitation lines from e.g. type 2 seyferts .    in view of this proposed scenario ,",
    "it is interesting to compare the spectra of rcw103 with that of the circinus galaxy , an archetype seyfert 2 galaxy whose observed line ratios are listed in table  [ tab_cmpr ] .",
    "the most striking difference is that the high excitation ( coronal ) lines are much stronger in circinus with , in particular , [ nev]/[neiii]=1 and roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger than in rcw103 .",
    "such a strong [ nev ] could be in principle compatible with emission from the precursor of a @xmath75 km / s shock ( cf .",
    "[ shock_pred ] ) , while even higher velocities , i.e. @xmath761000 km / s , could probably account for highest ionization coronal lines ( e.g. [ six ] ) .",

    "shock gas , but this is incompatible with the observed line profiles which are remarkably narrow ( fwhm@xmath28150 km / s , oliva et al .",
    "@xcite ) and similar for all ionization species . therefore",
    ", a shock dominated model for the circinus galaxy seems very unlikely and , more generally , the role played by the photoionized precursor in seyferts could be questioned on the basis of the following arguments .",
    "if dominated by photoionization , the low excitation lines from the post  shock region ( e.g. [ sii ] ) should be broader than those from the photoionized precursor ( e.g. [ oiii ] ) , but this is in strict contrast with the observations which show that [ oiii ] and higher excitation lines are usually broader than those of [ sii ] and lower excitation species .",
    "the ism medium of seyfert galaxies is well known to be quite `` porous '' , especially within the ionization cones , and several arguments indicate that the line emitting clouds are probably density bounded ( e.g. binette et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the host galaxies of liners , on the contrary , are often very rich in both gas and dust , a spectacular example being ngc4945 ( e.g. moorwood et al .",
    "it seems therefore curious that the shocks in seyferts should primarily impact onto the relatively few large clouds ( i.e. those with large enough column density to absorb all the ionizing photons from the shock ) while , in liners , the shocks should selectively avoid the largest clouds and only hit regions with low column densities ( i.e. those which can not produce a bright precursor ) .",
    "the absence of significant emission from the pre ",
    "shock region in rcw103 indicates that shock models may overestimate the importance of the precursor region .",
    "we have presented ir spectroscopic observations of rcw103 , a relatively young and fast ( about @xmath14 yr and @xmath31200 km / s , nugent et al .",

[ shock_models ] ) .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by prominent lines from low excitation species which have been used to estimate the density , temperature and abundances of the emitting region .",
    "the results indicate this is post  shock gas with relatively low density ( @xmath77 @xmath6 ) , normal ism abundance and essentially free of dust .",
    "although the [ niii ] lines seem to require a large nickel overabundance we argue , however , that this simply reflects uncertainties in the atomic parameters and propose that the collision strength for [ niii]6.64 is @xmath54=1 and a factor of 7 larger than the computed value .",
    "smaller uncertainties in some of the atomic parameters for [ feii ] are also suggested by the data which nevertheless exclude large errors in the computed collision strengths",
