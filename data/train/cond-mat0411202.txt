    "in recent years , the importance of networks in different fields has become increasingly clear @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that many real world networks possess topologies which introduce important effects on the processes taking place on them .",
    "one of the most interesting and important of these processes is the synchronization of coupled dynamical systems .",
    "synchronization is found in fields ranging from physics to biology @xcite , and in many cases involves a large network of dynamical systems .",
    "the structure of this network plays a crucial role in determining the synchronization of the coupled elements .",
    "kuramoto @xcite proposed and exactly solved a model for the synchronization of all - to - all uniformly coupled phase oscillators .",
    "his model and solution have become a guide as to how the coupling strength and the properties of the oscillators ( e.g. , their natural frequencies ) might affect their synchronization , and generalizations of this basic model have been studied @xcite . some attempts to study the kuramoto model with networks different from the all - to - all network",
    "have been made @xcite .",
    "networks in which the interaction strength depends on a distance have been studied , and it has been numerically found that a transition from incoherent to coherent behavior occurs at a critical value of the coupling strength @xcite .",
    "the kuramoto model in networks without global coupling has recently started to receive attention .",
    "it was numerically observed @xcite that a transition is also present in scale free networks .",
    "very recently , a mean field theory to determine the transition to synchronization in more general networks has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the mean field theory result is that the critical coupling strength @xmath0 is determined by the kuramoto value , @xmath1 , rescaled appropriately by the first two moments of the degree distribution of the nodes in the network : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 the degree @xmath4 of node @xmath5 is the number of connections between node @xmath5 and other nodes of the network , and @xmath6 is the number of nodes in the network .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond the mean field approximation , obtaining a better estimate of the critical coupling strength .",
    "we also describe the behavior of a suitably defined order parameter past the transition .",
    "we show how our results reduce to those of the mean field theory when an additional assumption is introduced , and present examples in different regimes .",
    "we find that in some regimes the mean field approximation does not provide an adequate description of the transition , whereas our more general estimate does .",
    "we also show how our results explain observations for networks with distance dependent interaction strength .",
    "we study finite size effects caused mainly by nodes of small degree , and find that the transition point is shifted to larger values of the coupling strength when these effects are taken into account .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ self ]",
    "we present our theory and discuss the mean field approach . in section  [ examples ] , we present numerical examples for different situations and test the different approximations . in section  [ nonuniform ]",
    "we discuss the case of networks with nonuniform coupling strength . in section",
    "[ linear ] , we present a linear analysis of the problem . in section  [ fluctuations ]",
    "we consider finite size effects caused primarily by nodes with a small number of connections .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "some calculations were relegated to appendices [ appendixa ] , [ appendixa2 ] , and [ appendixb ] .",
    "as shown by kuramoto @xcite , the dynamics of weakly coupled , nearly identical limit cycle oscillators can , under certain conditions , be approximated by an equation for the phases @xmath7 of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the natural frequency of the oscillator @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the total number of oscillators and @xmath10 is a periodic function depending on the original equations of motion .",
    "the all - to - all kuramoto model assumes that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents an overall coupling strength . in order to incorporate the presence of a heterogeneous network , we assume that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the elements of a @xmath15 adjacency matrix @xmath16 determining the connectivity of the network",
    "therefore , we study the system @xmath17    for specificity , we will primarily consider the case where the @xmath14 are either @xmath18 ( nodes @xmath5 and @xmath19 are not connected ) or @xmath20 ( nodes @xmath5 and @xmath19 are connected , and all connections have equal strength ) .",
    "we assume that the network is undirected , so that @xmath21 .",
    "we assume also that , for each @xmath5 , the corresponding @xmath9 is independently chosen from a known oscillation frequency probability distribution @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is symmetric about a single local maximum ( cf .",
    "sec  [ linear ] ) , which without loss of generality we can take to be at @xmath23 .",
    "( if the mean frequency is @xmath24 , we make the change of coordinates that shifts each @xmath9 by @xmath25 and each @xmath7 by @xmath26 . ) in this case , synchronization will occur at frequency @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath7 will remain approximately constant for synchronized nodes .",
    "we define a positive real valued local order parameter @xmath27 by @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a time average . in terms of @xmath30 , eq .  ( [ eq : coupled ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 where the term @xmath32 takes into account time fluctuations and is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 stands for the imaginary part .",
    "since we regard @xmath35 as a sum of @xmath4 approximately uncorrelated terms ( where @xmath4 is the degree of node @xmath5 given by @xmath36 ) , we expect @xmath35 to be of order @xmath37 .",
    "substantially above the transition , due to the synchronization of the phases , the quantity @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "thus , if we assume that @xmath40 , substantially above the transition the term @xmath41 can be neglected with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "however , just above the transition to coherence , the number of oscillators that are phase locked is small ( see below ) , and so the term @xmath30 is also small .",
    "we need the number of locked oscillators to be large enough so that we can neglect @xmath35 , but , in cases where we use perturbative methods , we also require that the number of locked oscillators be small enough that the perturbative methods are still valid .",
    "we therefore do not expect the perturbative methods to agree perfectly just at the transition point .",

    ", we show in appendix a that the sum over the unlocked oscillators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) can be neglected .",

    "we thus obtain the approximation @xmath54    since we are interested in the transition to coherence , we look for the solution of eq .",

    "the arrows indicate which network corresponds to the given curve .",
    "we observe that , as the connections per node are decreased , the transition point shifts to larger values of the coupling constant .",
    "this trend is reproduced by the growth rate curves , which are displaced to the right for smaller values of the degree .",
    "we emphasize that the theory we described above is applicable to networks for which @xmath218 is large but finite .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ figflu ] we applied the theory to cases in which @xmath218 is not very large . although we do not expect the theory to be valid in this case , we find that it correctly describes the trend present in the numerical observations , i.e. , a shifting of the transition to coherence to larger values of the critical coupling as nodes of small degree become important .",
    "a transition to coherence in large networks of coupled oscillators should be expected at a critical value of the coupling strength which is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network and its associated eigenvector . in the all - to - all case ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue is @xmath219 and thus the kuramoto result @xmath220 is recovered .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network is of both theoretical and practical importance , and thus its properties have been studied in some detail @xcite .",
    "we remark that our analysis allows the case of nonuniform interaction strengths by introducing continuous values in the entries of the adjacency matrix @xmath16 .",
    "we developed different approximations in order to describe the transition to coherence in terms of an appropriately defined order parameter which generalizes the parameter used in the classical kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "see table  [ abbreviations ] and figure  [ fig : diagram ] for a summary of the approximations and assumptions .",
    "the time averaged theory ( tat ) provided the most accurate description of the behavior of the order parameter , and assumes knowledge of the adjacency matrix @xmath14 and the individual frequencies @xmath9 . the frequency distribution approximation ( fda ) also provides a good approximation but does not require knowledge of the individual frequencies .",
    "these approximations yield equations that have to be solved numerically .",
    "the time required to numerically solve these equations is , however , much less than that required to numerically integrate the original differential equations .",
    "the perturbation theory ( pt ) yields analytic expressions for the order parameter when close to the transition in terms of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and its associated eigenvector , but is limited to networks with a relatively homogeneous degree distribution . the mean field theory ( mf ) @xcite",
    "is obtained by introducing the additional assumption that the components of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue are proportional to the degree of the corresponding node .",
    "this does not necessarily have to be the case when close to the transition , and because of this extra assumption , we expect the other approximations to more generally accurately describe the transition than the mean field theory",
    "[ figama](a ) and ( b ) show that for the particular case of scale free networks with @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 this is the case .",
    "in general , we observed that for low values of the exponent @xmath224 ( see fig .",
    "[ figama ] ) the mean field approximation and the perturbative approximation yield different critical coupling strengths .",
    "the mean field theory has the advantage that analytic expressions can be computed without the need of solving the eigenvalue problem for the adjacency matrix , and could be useful when only limited information is available about the network .",
    "however , in general , our results suggest that one of the other approximations mentioned above should be used .",
    "we remark that even though the time averaged theory , the frequency distribution approximation and the perturbation theory require in principle knowledge of the full matrix @xmath16 , knowledge of the degree distribution may be enough in some cases . as in our examples ,",
    "an adjacency matrix @xmath16 can be generated randomly with a given degree distribution .",
    "our results indicate that even this limited reconstruction of the original network might improve the mean field results ( see sec .",
    "[ examples ] ) .",
    "our assumptions restrict the class of networks for which the results apply .",
    "we assumed that sufficiently near the onset of synchronization each node is coupled to many _ locked _ oscillators . in practice",
    "this implies that most nodes should have a high degree .",
    "this is an important restriction for our theory . in sec .",
    "[ examples ] we used networks with a minimum degree of @xmath154 . as mentioned before , we observed that in networks with small average degree ( about @xmath225 ) , the observed critical coupling was larger than the one predicted by our theory . by including the previously neglected time fluctuations",
    ", we developed a heuristic theory in sec .",
    "[ fluctuations ] which correctly predicts the trend observed in the numerical simulations .",
    "as the nodes with small degree become important , both our theory and the numerical observations indicate that the transition to synchrony occurs at larger values of the coupling strength .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have developed a theory predicting the critical coupling for the transition from incoherence to coherence in large networks of coupled oscillators .",
    "we found that for a large class of networks , a transition to coherence should be expected at a critical value of the coupling strength which is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network .",
    "we developed and compared various approximations to the order parameter past the transition , and studied the effect of the fluctuations caused by finite size effects .        in this appendix",
    "we show that , using assumption  @xmath49 , we can neglect the sum over the unlocked oscillators in eq .",

    "if there are many terms in the sum , it will be then of order @xmath242 due to the symmetry of the frequency distribution , and thus will be small compared with the sum over the locked oscillators , which is of order @xmath4 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : betass ] ) ] .",
    "note that we did not use here the full strength of assumption  @xmath49 , since we only required the sign of @xmath230 to be independent of @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "here we show that for sufficiently large @xmath6 and a power law degree distribution of the degrees , @xmath245 , the mean field approximation @xmath246 underestimates @xmath70 for @xmath247 .",
