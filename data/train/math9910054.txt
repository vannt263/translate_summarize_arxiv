    "let @xmath3 be a polynomial map .",
    "the polynomial describes a family of complex affine hypersurfaces @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the family is locally trivial , so the hypersurfaces have constant topology , except at finitely many _ irregular _ fibers @xmath4 whose topology may differ from the generic or _",
    "regular _ fiber of @xmath6 .",
    "we would like to give a full description of the topology of this family in terms of easily computable data .",
    "this paper describes some progress .",
    "we will restrict mostly to the case that @xmath6 has only isolated singularities .",
    "we show that the data then needed are local monodromy maps obtained by transporting a fixed generic fiber @xmath7 around the irregular fibers , and the `` milnor fibers '' of the singular points and singularities at infinity of @xmath6 : these are certain submanifolds of @xmath7 that describe the loss of topology at irregular fibers .",
    "it is convenient to subdivide this necessary data as follows . for each irregular fiber",
    "we need    * the milnor fibers associated with it ; * the local monodromy for the irregular fiber restricted to each milnor fiber ; * the embeddings of the milnor fibers into a fixed `` reference '' regular fiber @xmath7 .",
    "the first two items are local ingredients , while the third is global .",
    "we are able to give complete computation of the local ingredients for @xmath2 ( see theorem [ th : dim2 ] ) .",
    "the remaining problem for @xmath2 is therefore the third item , although we obtain enough constraints that the complete topology can be sometimes be deduced .",
    "we use the brianon polynomial as an illustrative example . in this case our general results quickly yield the previous homological monodromy computations of artal - bartolo , cassou - nogues , and dimca @xcite and dimca and nemethi @xcite .",
    "since our computations are geometric , we obtain sharper information ( action on the intersection form , etc . ) .",
    "in fact , our computations strongly suggest a candidate description for the complete topology .",
    "however , this description remains conjectural , so the example illustrates both the strengths and current limitations of our approach .",
    "as in the paper @xcite , we also give a detailed description on the level of homology .",
    "that paper shows that , if @xmath6 is _ good _ , that is , it has only isolated singularities and no singularities at infinity , then for @xmath8 the homological data describes the complete topology .",
    "our results prepare the ground for an extension of this result to the case that there are singularities at infinity ( at least if the singularities at infinity are also isolated ) , by extending the topological model of @xcite to allow singularities at infinity .",
    "before we describe our results in more detail , we say a bit more about the basic set - up .",
    "a fiber can be irregular in two ways :    * it may have singularities ; * it may be `` irregular at infinity '' : failure of local triviality near the given fiber occurs outside arbitrarily large compact sets .    of course a fiber can be both singular and irregular at infinity ; this will , for instance , always be the case if the fiber has non - isolated singularities .",
    "there have been many papers dealing with algebraic conditions that imply regularity at infinity ( m - tameness of @xcite which asks that the given fiber and all nearby fibers be transverse to sufficiently large spheres ; @xmath9-regularity of @xcite and @xcite which generalizes this to allow non - round spheres ; the stronger t - regularity of @xcite , equivalent to the `` malgrange condition '' of @xcite ) . for",
    "@xmath2 these conditions are all equivalent to regularity at infinity ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , but in higher dimensions they are not mutually equivalent . for our purposes the weakest concept of irregularity at infinity , namely the topological one given above , suffices .",
    "in @xcite we described results that hold under no conditions on singularities .",
    "as already mentioned , we will here be particularly interested in fibers which have only isolated singularities , but no restriction on singularities at infinity .",
    "there have been several recent studies of polynomial maps for which the singularities at infinity are also restricted to be isolated in an appropriate sense ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however most of our results are new even for this case .",
    "in particular , the second part of this paper deals only with the case of dimension @xmath2 , in which case singularities at infinity are always isolated .    at an irregular fiber",
    "there is a loss of topology compared with the regular fiber . for an isolated singularity",
    "the change in topology is captured by the milnor fiber @xcite of the singularity .",
    "if @xmath6 is `` good '' ( no singularities at infinity ) then these milnor fibers account for all the topology of the regular fiber in a way that is made precise by neumann and rudolph @xcite .    for a singularity at infinity",
    "there is a `` milnor fiber at infinity , '' first described by suzuki @xcite for @xmath2 .",
    "one point of this paper is to extend the theory of @xcite to encompass the milnor fibers at infinity also , and to show that the new ingredients  the topology of the singularities at infinity of an irregular fiber , as encoded by the milnor fibers at infinity and the monodromy maps on these milnor fibers  are recoverable for @xmath2 in full from the link at infinity of the irregular fiber .",
    "to clarify what we mean by `` loss of topology at an irregular fiber '' we start with a simple homological result which is true under no assumption on @xmath6 .",
    "[ def : vanishing ] for any fiber @xmath4 of @xmath10 choose @xmath11 sufficiently small that all fibers @xmath12 with @xmath13 are regular ( @xmath14 is the closed disk of radius @xmath11 about @xmath15 ) and let @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a regular fiber in @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 is the group of _ vanishing @xmath20-cycles _ for @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the set of irregular values of @xmath6 .",
    "choose a regular value @xmath22 for @xmath6 and paths @xmath23 from @xmath22 to @xmath15 for each @xmath24 which are disjoint except at @xmath22 .",
    "we use these paths to refer homology of a regular fiber near one of the irregular fibers @xmath4 to the homology of the `` reference '' regular fiber @xmath25 . from now on @xmath7 will always mean this particular regular fiber .",
    "[ th : van ] for @xmath26 the maps @xmath27 induce an isomorphism @xmath28 moreover , the map @xmath29 with kernel @xmath30 is surjective , so @xmath31 .",
    "thus the group of vanishing cycles measures homologically the `` loss of topology '' at an irregular fiber , and these groups account for all the homology of the regular fiber .",
    "we now restrict to a fiber @xmath4 with at most isolated singularities ( but possibly singular at infinity ) .",
    "the `` nonsingular core '' of @xmath4 is obtained by intersecting @xmath4 with a very large ball and then removing small regular neighborhoods of its singularities .",
    "more precisely , there is a radius @xmath32 such that for any @xmath33 the sphere @xmath34 of radius @xmath35 about the origin intersects @xmath4 transversally .",
    "choose any @xmath33 and denote @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the disk of radius @xmath35 about the origin in @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath38 is the _ compact core _ of the fiber @xmath4 .",
    "the fiber @xmath4 is topologically the result of adding an open collar to the boundary of @xmath38 .",
    "any singularities of @xmath6 on @xmath4 lie on @xmath38 and we remove small open regular neighborhoods of these singularities to form a boundaried @xmath39-manifold @xmath40 , the _ non - singular core _ of @xmath4 .    there may be boundary components of @xmath38 outside of which the topology of nearby fibers of @xmath6 is the same as that of @xmath4 , in the sense that @xmath6 restricted to the appropriate component of @xmath41 gives a locally trivial fibration for @xmath33 and @xmath42 sufficiently small .",
    "we call such boundary components _ regular _ and call the other boundary components of @xmath38 _ irregular_. thus @xmath4 is regular at infinity if and only if all boundary components of @xmath38 are regular .    by standard arguments ( see section [ sec : alldim ] ) we can embed @xmath43 ( if @xmath11 is small enough ) so that @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the projection to @xmath14 . by restricting @xmath47 to @xmath48 we thus get an embedding of @xmath40 into a nearby regular fiber @xmath49 of @xmath6 .",
    "the complement @xmath50 then consists of the disjoint union of the milnor fibers of the singularities of @xmath6 on @xmath4 and certain non - compact pieces .",
    "these non - compact pieces will be half - open collars on the regular boundary components of @xmath38 and other pieces which meet @xmath40 at irregular boundary components of @xmath38 .",
    "we call the latter the _ milnor fibers at infinity _ for @xmath4 .    by _ milnor fibers of @xmath6",
    "_ we will mean all milnor fibers of isolated singularities of @xmath6 and all milnor fibers at infinity .",
    "if we want to emphasize that a milnor fiber is not at infinity we will call it a _ finite milnor fiber_. let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be all the milnor fibers at infinity respectively finite milnor fibers for @xmath4 .",
    "we will consider the milnor fibers to lie in our standard regular fiber @xmath7 , by transporting the fiber @xmath49 along the path @xmath23 .",
    "topologically , the fiber @xmath4 results from @xmath7 by collapsing each finite milnor fiber to a point and removing each milnor fiber at infinity .",
    "this is the sense in which the milnor fibers capture the loss of topology of the fiber @xmath4 .",
    "we can use the local monodromy to relate this to vanishing cycles .    for each irregular fiber @xmath4 , by transporting a nearby regular fiber @xmath53 in a small loop around the fiber @xmath4",
    "we get a local monodromy map @xmath54 . by using the path @xmath23 to refer this monodromy to the reference regular fiber @xmath25 we consider it as a map @xmath55 .",
    "this monodromy map is well defined up to isotopy .",
    "if @xmath4 has isolated singularities , the local monodromy @xmath55 can be normalized to be the identity on the image in @xmath7 of the non - singular core of @xmath4 ( use the above embedding @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath57 restricts to a local monodromy map on each milnor fiber @xmath58 .",
    "we denote this local monodromy map @xmath59 also by @xmath57 , or simply @xmath60 .",
    "this map is the identity on @xmath61 , so it induces a map in homology called the _ variation _ ( introduced by @xcite , but with different sign convention ) @xmath62 obtained by taking a relative cycle @xmath63 to the closed cycle @xmath64 .",

    "the _ link at infinity _ of a fiber @xmath4 with isolated singularities is the link @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is any sphere around the origin of radius greater than the number @xmath32 mentioned above . for a regular fiber",
    "this link is independent , up to equivalence , of the choice of fiber and is called the _ regular link at infinity for @xmath6_. a standard construction shows that a seifert surface of this regular link at infinity @xmath79 is diffeomorphic to the compact core @xmath80 of a regular fiber ( for @xmath2 this gives the minimal seifert surface , and this minimal seifert surface is unique , see @xcite ) .",
    "the seifert linking form @xmath81 on the homology of a seifert surface is a useful invariant of a link .",

    "@xmath83    [ th : seifert ] suppose @xmath6 has only isolated singularities , so theorems [ th : van ] and [ th : homology ] give a direct sum decomposition @xmath84    if we order the set @xmath21 so that the paths @xmath23 , @xmath85 , depart the point @xmath22 in anti - clockwise order , then with respect to this direct sum decomposition the seifert form of the regular link at infinity has lower triangular block form , with diagonal blocks given by the forms @xmath86 of ( [ eq : seifert ] ) , and with off - diagonal blocks equal to zero for pairs of summands with the same @xmath15 : @xmath87    if @xmath6 is good , that is , there are no milnor fibers at infinity , these results are in @xcite in slightly different formulation , as follows . the variation map @xmath88 is an isomorphism for the milnor fiber of an isolated singularity .",
    "moreover , in this case the homology @xmath89 vanishes for @xmath90 by @xcite .",

    "the _ splice diagram _ of the link at infinity of a complex affine plane curve ( @xcite ) , which from the point of view of classical algebraic geometry is simply an encoding of the puiseux tree at infinity , also encodes the splice decomposition of the link at infinity ( @xcite ) .",

    "the splice diagrams for the links at infinity of the fibers of @xmath6 were computed in @xcite .",
    "the regular splice diagram is as follows , where we have included the linking weights ( also called multiplicity weights ) at vertices in parentheses : @xmath294 the fact that vertices with zero linking weights occur is equivalent to each of the following two facts ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) :    * the regular link at infinity is not a fibered link ; * @xmath6 has fibers that are irregular at infinity .",

    "[ fig:5 ] ) .    .25    if we remove the boundary component marked with a dashed curve ( corresponding to the arrowhead where the fibered splice component at infinity splices to the rest of the irregular spliced diagram ) we obtain the milnor fiber at infinity for this irregular fiber .",
    "this would be @xmath305 in our earlier notation , but there is just the one milnor fiber at infinity for @xmath296 , so we call it @xmath306",

    "we need the monodromy in which the boundary of @xmath306 ( consisting of the two circles at the left of the figure ) is fixed . by theorem 13.5 of @xcite",
    "it is the result of doing a dehn twist on an annulus parallel to each of these boundary components .",
    "it follows that the variation map @xmath307 takes a generator of @xmath308 to the homology class of the difference of the two boundary components .",
    "following the orientation conventions of @xcite the bilinear form occurring in theorem [ th : seifert ] ( given by equation ( [ eq : seifert ] ) ) thus has matrix @xmath309 .    the regular fiber @xmath7 is the result of gluing the milnor fiber at infinity to the irregular fiber ( fig .",

    "the splice diagram for the link at infinity of this fiber is : @xmath315 so the irregular fiber @xmath297 has euler characteristic @xmath161 and is thus an annulus .",
    "moreover , the fibered splice component at infinity for this irregular link at infinity has diagram : @xmath316 the fiber of this fibered multilink is a thrice - punctured torus ( right hand piece of fig .  [ fig:8 ] ) which glues to the irregular fiber as in fig .",

    ". the local monodromy on @xmath7 is thus also isotopic to this order @xmath318 map , since @xmath7 and @xmath317 just differ by a collar .",
    "again we can use this description to compute the local monodromy and the block @xmath320 of the seifert form .",
    "we describe this in greater detail later , but a quick approach is to note that there are exactly two different order @xmath318 transformations of the surface in question with given action on the boundary , differing only in orientation . the correct orientation can be deduced from the boundary twist computations in @xcite or by means of the equivariant signature computation of theorem 5.3 of @xcite ( as generalized in section 6 of that paper ) . in any case , with respect to a suitable basis of homology , the answer is : @xmath321 with @xmath322 still to be determined .    at this point we can write down the seifert matrix @xmath107 as @xmath323 with @xmath324 still to be determined . however , applying the relations of theorem [ th : relations ] gives : @xmath325 so in fact we just have three unknown integers in equations ( [ eq : hc2 ] ) , ( [ eq : hc1 ] ) , ( [ eq : seif ] ) , namely @xmath326 @xmath327 @xmath15 , and the others are then determined as @xmath328    the product of the two local monodromy maps is the monodromy at infinity for the regular fiber .",

    "however , one calculates easily that the isomorphism type of the monodromy representation over @xmath1 depends only on the vanishing or not of @xmath341 , which is non - vanishing since it is not divisible by @xmath304 .",

    "the argument ( due to l. rudolph ) is that for @xmath458 the intersection @xmath459 is transverse and the result is a union of disks by the maximum modulus principle , since it is equivalent to the set @xmath460 . on the other hand , @xmath461 by the argument that identifies @xmath462 with collars on the @xmath455 s ,",
    "so @xmath104 is a union of solid tori .",
    "the above decomposition of @xmath464 gives splice decompositions of the links at infinity of the fibers of @xmath6 .",
    "the basic fact was described earlier in this section : if @xmath465 is a link and we cut the link exterior @xmath466 into pieces along embedded tori , then this represents @xmath465 as the result of a splicing operations .",
    "in particular , the piece @xmath467 of @xmath464 is the exterior of a splice component @xmath465 , where @xmath468 is the link consisting of the cores of the solid tori making up @xmath104 .",
    "this splice component is the fundamental multilink for @xmath6 as described in @xcite .",
    "the fibration of the the exterior @xmath467 of this multilink is simply given by the restriction @xmath469 .",
    "we shall see that , possibly after minor modification to eliminate parallel tori , the above splice decomposition of the link at infinity of an irregular fiber of @xmath6 is as described in theorem [ th : dim2 ] .",
    "note that @xmath470 is a fibration of @xmath471 over the punctured disc @xmath472 with each fiber a union of circles ( isotopic to the regular link at infinity of @xmath6 ) .",
    "we can extend this map over the solid tori @xmath455 to get a seifert fibration of @xmath104 .",
    "but @xmath104 is a disjoint union of one or more solid tori and , up to isotopy , the only seifert fibrations of a solid torus are the standard @xmath473-fibrations in which the core circle is a fiber and the general fiber @xmath474-fold covers this core circle ( we do not rule out the possibility of @xmath475 , called a `` generalized seifert fibration '' in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , each component of @xmath476 is a solid torus with a collection of thinner solid tori removed , all or all but one of which run parallel to fibers of this seifert fibration , and maybe one running parallel to the core circle .",
    "the latter will lead to the non - fibered components mentioned in the theorem .",
    "however , some components of @xmath476 could be of the form : solid torus minus a thinner solid torus parallel to the core circle , giving a toral annulus @xmath477 . in this case",
    "the two torus boundary components of this piece are parallel , so to obtain an irredundant splice decomposition we must omit one of them and absorb this toral annulus as a collar on an adjacent splice component .    to complete the proof of theorem [ th : dim2 ]",
    "we must show the splice decomposition we have found is as described in that theorem .",
    "we do this by examining our construction in terms of a compactification of @xmath400 .",
    "since the relationship between the compactification divisor and the splice diagram is already worked out in detail in @xcite and @xcite , this then does what we require .",
    "we extend the polynomial map @xmath478 to a map @xmath479 of a smooth compact complex surface @xmath480 to @xmath481 .",
    "the compactification divisor @xmath482 is a union of smooth rational curves with dual intersection graph a tree .",
    "a component of @xmath483 on which @xmath484 is non - constant is called _ horizontal_. a component of @xmath483 on which @xmath484 is constant is called _ finite _ or _ infinite _ according to the value of @xmath484 on it .",
    "we can encode the topology of @xmath483 in the usual way by a plumbing graph . this is a tree , with vertices corresponding to components of @xmath483 and edges for intersections between components .",
    "it has a weight at each vertex to show the self - intersection number of the corresponding component of @xmath483 .",
    "we draw arrows at vertices to indicate where fibers of @xmath484 intersect @xmath483 .",
    "the following diagram , which gives a compactification divisor for the brianon polynomial , uses solid arrows for the general fiber and dashed respectively dotted arrows for the two irregular fibers .",
    "note that the three curves on the left could be blown down if we only wanted a compactification on which @xmath484 is well defined ; they arose from blowing up to resolve a singularity of an irregular fiber on @xmath483 .",

    "removing the next lightest shaded region then removes @xmath486 , to give the 4-disk that we called @xmath241 . * finally , removing the dark regions then removes the components of sets @xmath487 where a fiber @xmath4 is irregular at infinity ( we have also indicated the components where these fibers are regular at infinity , which are not removed ) .",
    "thus @xmath408 is represented by what has been left white .",
    "recall that the parameters in this construction are chosen in the order @xmath414 ( sufficiently large ) , @xmath438 ( sufficiently large ) , @xmath11 ( sufficiently small ) , @xmath35 ( sufficiently large ) .",
    "thus the second lightest region , which removes a neighborhood of the horizontal and finite curves of @xmath483 , is in fact much the thinnest , although we have pictured the regions all of comparable size .",
    "most of the boundary between the dark regions and @xmath408 is parallel to fibers of @xmath6 , with just the small parts near the intersection with the irregular fibers being transverse to fibers of @xmath6 ( these parts are solid tori ) .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the splice diagrams at infinity are derived from the plumbing graph as above , with the parts of the splice diagram having respectively positive , zero , or negative total linking weights corresponding to respectively infinite , horizontal , or finite curves of @xmath483 .",
    "we thus see that the tori along which the splice decomposition of @xmath464 occurs are as claimed in theorem [ th : dim2 ] , completing the proof ( in the picture these are the places where two different grey - tones meet white ) .",
    "choose a generic line interval @xmath488 from a point @xmath401 of @xmath489 to a point @xmath423 of @xmath490 .",
    "we can assume , by choosing @xmath11 sufficiently small , that @xmath488 does not intersect any of the @xmath11-disks around irregular values except at its end point @xmath401 .",
    "then @xmath491 will be a seifert surface for the link at infinity of @xmath4 ( considered as a link in @xmath464 ) .",
    "this @xmath492 is the union of seifert surfaces for each of the splice components described in the proof ( we work with the splice decomposition before the elimination of the redundant toral annulus components ) :    * @xmath493 is a fiber of the fundamental multilink and is the compact core of a regular fiber . * @xmath494 is the disjoint union of the milnor fibers @xmath495 at infinity for @xmath4 ; these are the fibers of fibered splice components corresponding to the @xmath455 . * @xmath496 is a union of annuli giving seifert surfaces for the seifert fibered pieces .",
    "note that the complement of the above minimal seifert surface @xmath492 in the boundary of @xmath497 is the result @xmath498 of removing the milnor fibers @xmath58 from @xmath499 .",
    "this @xmath500 has boundary isotopic to the link at infinity that we are considering and it realizes the minimal slice genus of this link , by the solution of the thom conjecture . the minimal seifert surface @xmath492 is the result of pasting doubles of the milnor fibers at infinity onto boundary components of a copy of @xmath498 .    summarizing , our link at infinity , as a link in the boundary of a 4-ball @xmath449 , has the property : there is a 2-manifold @xmath7 containing a sub-2-manifold @xmath498 and an embedding @xmath501\\subset d^4 $ ] such that @xmath502 is a minimal slice surface for the link while the rest of @xmath503)$ ] lies in @xmath504 and is a minimal seifert surface for the link",
    "this is a presumably already very special property of links at infinity of affine curves , not shared by general links .",
