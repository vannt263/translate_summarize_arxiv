    "a single massive particle is placed at apocenter to mimic the effect of the dwarf satellite and integrated in the same potential as the disk particles .",
    "the disk particles feel the perturbations from the dwarf galaxy , though not each other . the dwarf galaxy is put on an orbit with eccentricity and orbital period similar to those used to predict the location and motions of the sgr dwarf debris @xcite .",
    "we chose an orbit for the dwarf galaxy similar to that of sgr dwarf because this orbit is well constrained by observations and because its pericenter is small enough that a more massive dwarf galaxy in this orbit would have strongly perturbed the milky way disk .",
    "the force from the satellite is softened at short distances so that spurious large velocities are not induced when it passes through the galactic disk .",
    "the test particles are integrated for four radial oscillations periods of the dwarf galaxy orbit .",
    "thus the disk feels four close pericenter passages .",
    "the gravitational potential of the galaxy is not varied during the simulation , thus there is no indirect perturbation that should have been caused by variation in the position of the center of the galaxy with respect to the center of mass frame . as these are test particle simulations , the self - gravity of the disk and response of the halo to the satellite are neglected .",

    "while the current mass of sgr dwarf galaxy @xmath15 is not massive enough to strongly perturb the galactic disk , this galaxy could have been a few times @xmath0 in the past ( e.g. , see discussion by @xcite ) and so similar in mass to the subhalos considered by @xcite . in the context of a cdm hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm , @xcite",
    "show that it is not uncommon for a subhalos of sizescale @xmath16 to merge with a milky way sized galaxy .",
    "we consider satellites on tight orbits with pericenters approximately @xmath17 and masses 0.03 to 0.1 @xmath18 ( @xmath19 to @xmath20 ) .",
    "our satellites have pericenter and period similar to the shorter values estimated for sgr galaxy . in our units the estimated peri and apocenter galactocentric radii of sgr galaxy s orbit are 1.32.0 and 6.57.0 @xcite .",

    "variations in the orbit would have been present if dynamical friction were present or if the milky way gravitational potential were allowed to respond to the perturbation .      in figure",
    "[ fig : xyh]a we show the morphology in the plane of the galaxy as a function of time from the simulation a1 with parameters listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] and satellite on a polar orbit . images are shown separated in time by 3/4 of @xmath22 , the orbital period at the sun . in figure",
    "[ fig : xyh ] the galaxy is oriented so that rotation is clockwise . the simulation shown in figure [ fig : xyh]a has satellite orbit resembling that of sgr dwarf .",
    "the orbit is oriented so that is it polar or lying in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "the first pericenter passage is experienced 1.5 orbital periods ( at the sun ) from the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the first pericenter occurs below the galactic plane .",
    "the second and third pericenter passages occur closer to the galactic plane .",
    "the pericenters close approaches and passages through the plane of the galaxy induce velocity impulses in the stars in galactic disk . following the second pericenter spiral structure",
    "is induced in the disk with structure similar to that seen in simulations of flybys @xcite .",
    "the disk also exhibits some lopsidedness though not as much as displayed by the atomic hydrogen distribution in the milky way s outer disk @xcite .",
    "multiple close passages cause stronger spiral structure than a single flyby .",
    "this is not surprising as the tidal force during pericenter lasts longer when the orbit is bound rather than parabolic , and the disk can not completely dynamically relax between pericenters .",
    "the disk receives multiple perturbations from each close approach which can add constructively or destructively to particle eccentricity or inclination as the timescale between pericenters , about 3 @xmath22 , is comparable to the orbital period at 2 @xmath7 ( or 2 @xmath22 ) .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig : xyh ] shows that particle orbits can intersect other orbits .",
    "stellar orbits can cross each other but gas clouds would collide . as we see orbits that intersect each other , the gas distribution may differ from the stellar distribution .",
    "it is interesting to place this in perspective with the outer galaxy .",
    "there is no clear structure in the hi distribution ( as seen in the maps by @xcite ) in the milky way associated with the monoceros stream ( as seen in the maps by @xcite ) even though there is hi gas detected in the same region .",
    "figure [ fig : xyh]b is similar to figure [ fig : xyh]a except showing a the disk perturbed by a satellite on a prograde inclined orbit ( simulation a2 ) .",
    "the orbit s spin axis is 30@xmath24 from the galactic pole .",
    "we see that the perturbations on the disk are stronger for the inclined orbit .",
    "the outer disk is more strongly scattered and the induced spiral structure is stronger .    after the last pericenter passage ,",
    "the mean height of the disk above the galactic plane , radial and tangential velocity components ( in galactocentric coordinates ) are shown in figure [ fig : sag ] for both simulations .",
    "for these plots the radial velocity component is positive in the direction away from the galactic center .",
    "the velocity of a particle in a circular orbit has been subtracted from the tangential velocity component .",
    "as have other works ( e.g. , @xcite ) we find that the satellite induces spiral structure in the outer disk that is similar to that in monoceros stream .",
    "the tangential velocity component is not expected to be high ( second panels from top in figure [ fig : sag ] ) but there should be moderate radial velocity variations ( top panels in figure [ fig : sag ] ) .",
    "a comparison between the mean velocity components , the density distribution and the mean height ( shown in the second panels from bottom in figure [ fig : sag ] ) suggests that there could be correlations between these quantities in the outer milky way , though as we have neglected self - gravity in the disk , we should be cautious with this implication .",
    "we see from the second panel from the bottom in figure [ fig : sag ] that a warp has been excited by the passages of the satellite .",
    "the warp is complex and not well described by a single fourier component as is true for the outer milky way @xcite .",
    "however , its amplitude for the polar orbit simulation is smaller than that observed in the outer milky way even though the satellite , @xmath25 exceeds that estimated for the sgr dwarf galaxy by a factor of 10 .",
    "the outer milky way extends out of the plane 4 - 6 kpc which would be @xmath26 in units of @xmath7 . from figure",
    "[ fig : sag ] we see that the mean height reaches only @xmath27 .",
    "a similar mass satellite on a tight orbit but inclined to the disk does induce a warp large enough to account for features seen in the outer galaxy ( as shown in figure [ fig : sag]b ) .",
    "there is currently no evidence for a coherent satellite with mass as large as we are simulating that could account for the morphology of the outer galaxy .",
    "as explored by @xcite with the lmc resonant perturbations could be important and a self - gravitating disk would be needed to more accurately simulate the coupling , or the response of the milky way halo is important and a live halo would be needed to simulate the effect .",
    "alternatively objects as massive as simulated here , possibly merging with the outer galaxy , are needed to explain the galactic warp .",
    "we consider whether the perturbations caused by the satellite would cause structure in the velocity distribution in a particular location such as the solar neighborhood .",
    "figure [ fig : uv ] shows the velocity distribution computed in a region centered at the solar position from stars that are within a distance of @xmath28 or @xmath29  pc .",
    "we find that spiral arms induced by the satellite can increase stellar eccentricities sufficiently that streams can be seen in the velocity distribution .",
    "large velocity streams are not well populated but streams at about 40 km / s ( at @xmath30 or @xmath31 from the local standard of rest in units of @xmath32 ) are seen in the simulations , particularly at positive @xmath33 .",
    "stars at positive @xmath33 correspond to those from the outer galaxy with eccentricity high enough that they can be seen in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these stars would correspond to a disk population that has lower metallicity than the thin disk population present in the solar neighborhood because they were born in the outer galaxy .",
    "such a population with origin in the outer disk has been postulated by @xcite .",
    "small population streams of stars at high velocity in the solar neighborhood have primarily been interpreted as remnants from disrupted satellites ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we find that they could also be comprised of disk stars but associated with recent tidal perturbations to the disk caused by moderate mass satellites or mergers .",
    "the relaxation or sheering timescale ( in rotation periods ) for epicyclic motions is fairly short .",
    "after perturbations cease , structure in the velocity distribution will become less and less prominent .",
    "@xcite shows that streams could last a few gyrs but would get closer and closer together at later times . in our simulations 1",
    "gyr corresponds approximately to 4 orbital periods . in our simulations",
    "because perturbations recur , the disk would never be relaxed and multiple streams would always be present .",
    "if the satellite were allowed to decay via dynamical friction , be disrupted and merge with the galaxy then we expect that the streams would become closer together finally dissolving into a diffuse distribution a few gyrs afterward the merger .",
    "after the satellite has disrupted or merged with the galaxy we expect spiral structure induced in the disk will wind up in 5 - 10 rotation periods .",
    "compact stellar streams such as seen in figure [ fig : uv ] will wrap into a diffuse smooth distribution via dynamical relaxation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however stars excited to higher eccentricities are likely to remain at higher eccentricity .",
    "we now look at angular momentum and eccentricity changes in the disk induced by the satellite .",
    "for 3 different ranges of initial radii and at different times we compute @xmath34 , the angular momentum change and @xmath35 , the particle eccentricity .",
    "the angular momentum change is computed by subtracting the current one from the initial one .",
    "the eccentricity is estimated as @xmath36 appropriate for a flat rotation curve @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dle ] shows eccentricity , @xmath35 , versus angular momentum change , @xmath34 , at the times separated by 2 @xmath22 for simulations a1 and a2 .",
    "each row is computed for a different range of initial radii .",
    "the top row corresponds to initial radius in the range 1.3 1.5 , the middle row 1.0  1.3 and the bottom row 0.81.0 .",
    "the left hand panels show the @xmath35 versus @xmath34 distribution following only a single pericenter passages . at this time little heating",
    "has taken place and there are strong correlations between angular momentum change and particle eccentricity caused by the satellite . however after 3 more pericenter passages the correlations between these properties are much weaker .",
    "from the top - right panels , particularly in figure [ fig : dle]b for the inclined satellite orbit , we can see that stars in the outer disk can experience changes in their angular momentum but also be placed in low eccentricity orbits .",
    "this means that a particle in a circular orbit can be moved to a nearly circular orbit with a different radius .",
    "this change can be called radial migration though here it is caused by gravitational scattering .",
    "stars with negative @xmath34 have orbits with mean radii interior to their initial radius whereas stars with positive @xmath34 have mean radii outside their initial radii .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : dle]b that a significant population of stars from the outer galaxy that crosses into the inner galaxy .",
    "this implies that perturbations from satellites or subhalos can cause stars from the outer disk to reach the solar neighborhood .",
    "this mechanism provides a possible explanation for the population of moderate metallicity disk stars with positive @xmath33 velocity components originating in the outer galaxy that are present in the solar neighborhood and are discussed by @xcite .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : dle]b that there are also moderate eccentricity stars with positive @xmath34 and so mean radii exterior to their initial radius .",
    "this population of stars forms a diffuse extended stellar disk possibly similar to those sometimes seen seen in the outskirts of other galaxies @xcite . because of the large wide distribution of @xmath34 and @xmath35 at later times in the outer disk ( figure [ fig : dle]b ) the outer disk would have a reduced metallicity gradient but large metallicity scatter compared to the inner disk .",
    "perturbations from satellites could account for the flattening of the metallicity gradient in the outskirts of other galaxies @xcite .    while we have considered only one satellite here , @xcite suggest that a subhalo of this size can be expected to interact with a milky way sized galaxy approximately every gyr .",
    "a galaxy of this size is suspected to have left behind @xmath37 cen and the @xmath37 cen moving group @xcite .",
    "as the orbit chosen here was short , significant disk heating occurred in a short timescale ( @xmath38 gyrs ) .",
    "future studies could consider heating and mixing by more than one satellite ( or halo substructure ) , those that merge and those drawn from a distribution consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation models .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dli ] we show the distribution of angular momentum change versus inclination and the eccentricity versus inclination change , for stars with different initial radial bins .",
    "the inclination for each star is estimated as @xmath39 .",
    "correlations between eccentricity and inclination ( see figure [ fig : dli]b ) and between inclination and angular momentum change are also much reduced after a few satellite orbits .",
    "stars moved into the inner galaxy ( the left hand side of panels in figure [ fig : dli]a can also be on moderate inclination orbits .",
    "we note that there is a deficit of low eccentricity and low inclination stars that have experienced large angular momentum changes , so correlations between these quantities have not been completely erased at later times .",
    "in this paper we have used particle integration simulations to investigate the effect on the milky way disk of a fairly low mass satellite in a tight orbit around the milky way .",
    "we find that a warp , lopsidedness and spiral structure are excited in the outer disk by a satellite in an orbit similar to that estimated by the sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "these structures are strong providing the mass of the satellite is @xmath40 , the orbit pericenter is small , @xmath41  kpc .",
    "perturbations are stronger when the satellite is in an inclined rather than polar orbit . if the orbital period of the satellite is short compared to the relaxation timescale of the disk then structure is increasingly excited each orbit and the disk continuously displays structure such as lopsidedness , a warp and spiral structure .",
    "stellar orbits can intersect implying that the stellar distribution and gas distribution in the outer galaxy could differ following tidal perturbations by a satellite .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possibility that differences between the stellar and gas distribution might be used to differentiate between models with and without warp - mode and lopsided - mode excitation .",
    "perturbations in the disk are also seen in a constructed velocity distribution at a specific location in the disk .",
    "this procedure creates a simulated version of the velocity distribution in the solar neighborhood .",
    "strong low velocity streams are present within @xmath42km / s of the local standard of rest .",
    "smaller streams at higher velocities can also be present , mostly at positive @xmath33 , representing stars that come into the solar neighborhood from the outer galaxy .",
    "we infer that moderate velocity streams in the solar neighborhood velocity distribution could be caused by strong recent tidal perturbations in the outer galaxy .",
    "we find that correlations between eccentricity , inclination and and angular momentum change are reduced after a few pericenter satellite passages .",
    "the eccentricity and angular momentum distribution is broad for stars born near the satellite pericenter radius , and includes low eccentricity stars .",
    "correlations between inclination and eccentricity are reduced after a few satellite orbits .",
    "disk stars born in the outer galaxy can come into the inner galaxy .",
    "some of them can be put in low eccentricity orbits at radii distant from their birth places .",
    "we infer that radial mixing and migration can be induced by satellite or subhalo perturbations in the outer disk .",
    "such a scenario may account for the lack of strong correlation between metallicity and space velocities and moderate metallicity stars at positive @xmath33 seen in the solar neighborhood .",
    "such a scenario may also account for flattening of the metallicity gradient in the outskirts of other galaxies @xcite .    as the simulations here integrated test particle trajectories in an isothermal gravitational potential they only poorly approximate the dynamics of the galactic disk .",
    "the simulations here could be redone with n - body simulations and more realistic galactic mass models .",
    "simulations which include a self - gravitating disk can investigate the excitation of global modes ( e.g. , @xcite ) in context with disk heating , radial mixing and the structure of the stellar velocity distribution .",
    "the satellite orbit chosen for this study is extreme in that the pericenter distance from the galactic center is small and the orbital period short ( as is true for the estimated orbit of sgr dwarf galaxy and that estimated for @xmath37  cen s progenitor ; @xcite ) .",
    "we did not allow the satellite orbit to decay via dynamical friction , be tidally stripped or merge with the milky way .",
    "as the satellite spirals inwards due to dynamical friction its mass would be reduced as it is tidally stripped by the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however it may continue to perturb the galaxy disk as each pericenter passage brings it increasingly inward .",
    "a satellite with a higher central concentration would not be tidally disrupted until the satellite reaches a smaller galactocentric radius and so could perturb the disk over a larger range of radius than a diffuse object that is disrupted in the outer halo .",
    "a more realistic n - body based simulation that can exhibit variations in the galactic potential and satellite orbit would probably show increased heating and migration but weaker correlations between disk stellar eccentricity , inclination and distance from birth location than the simulations explored here .",
    "future studies could consider more realistic satellite orbits , satellites that merge with the galaxy and more than one satellite .",
    "we have demonstrated that radial mixing can be caused by tidal perturbations from satellite galaxies but much work remains to quantify the extent of the mixing and determine how it depends on satellite mass and orbit .",
    "future work could compare the importance of mixing caused by satellites and that caused by transient spiral structure .",
    "if mixing associated with tidal perturbations from satellite galaxies dominates and is required to account for metallicity and velocity distributions in some regions of the milky way disk then one might place statistical constraints on the number , mass and orbits of objects that have perturbed and merged with the milky way from the observed distributions .",
    "while we have seen correlations between eccentricity , inclination and angular momentum change reduced after a few satellite pericenter passages , weak correlations between these quantities do persist .",
    "futures studies should continue to search for correlations in these quantities to probe both merger remnant related and tidally induced structure models .    0.2 truein we thank richard edgar for invaluable help with the gpu cluster .",
