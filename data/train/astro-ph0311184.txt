    "here i present preliminary morphological results from _ singg _ - the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies .",
    "singg is an approved and ongoing survey project of the national optical astronomy observatoryical ( noao ) .",
    "it is a follow - up survey to hipass - the  parkes all sky survey ( staveley - smith _ et  al . _",
    "hipass has surveyed the entire southern sky for neutral hydrogen emission out to nearly 13000 .",
    "singg is intended to look for star formation , as traced by emission , in this  selected sample .",
    "the primary motivation for singg is to measure the star formation rate density of the local universe , .",
    "the selection by 21 cm emission bypasses all the common _ optical _ selection biases ( e.g.  dust content and surface brightness ) , which should allow a more complete and representative survey of local star formation .",
    "the planned incorporation of ultraviolet data from _ galex _ and infrared data from _ iras _ and _ sirtf _ will allow a multi - wavelength determination of , addressing issues of dust extinction and the initial mass function . singg is also intended to examine the region luminosity function , determining how it varies as a function of morphology and  mass , .    in this paper",
    "i address some of the morphological questions that motivate singg .",
    "in particular ( 1 ) what fraction of gas rich galaxies are dormant ? that is , what fraction contains no detectable star formation ? ( 2 ) how common are starbursts ? and",
    ", ( 3 ) how common are galactic winds ? addressing these questions will give us a better understanding of the life - cycle of star formation , and how star forming galaxies enrich the inter - galactic medium .",
    "after presenting a few more details of the singg survey in  2 , i discuss the  detectability of hipass sources in  3 . in  4 i present plans for making an objectively defined starburst sample and estimate the starburst incident rate . in ",
    "5 i summarize a morphological survey for extra - planar . finally ",
    "6 summarizes these preliminary results .",
    "the singg sample is selected from the hipass survey completely blind to the uv through infrared properties of the sources .",
    "a total of 471 targets with a peak  flux density @xmath1 jy in the parkes 21 cm spectrum were chosen by  so as to have a flat distribution in log ( ) . this is impossible at the lowest and highest masses , where the hipass sample is volume limited .",
    "otherwise , we have preferentially selected the nearest galaxies in each  bin so as to better resolve  regions .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of the final sample .",
    "the observations with the ctio 1.5 m typically comprise three exposures in a narrow band filter ( matched to the wavelength of  at the target s velocity ) and a broad band @xmath2 filter , for total exposure times of 30 and 6 minutes respectively .",
    "we use specialized software from the high-@xmath3 supernova group to align the images , combine the images within each filter and subtract the scaled @xmath2-band image to produce the net  image .",
    "the final images typically have 1.5  seeing .",
    "the @xmath4 point source detection limit is typically @xmath5 . on scales",
    "@xmath6 the images are typically flat to better than 1%  of the sky level allowing large scale features with @xmath7 ( 0.6 rayleigh ) to be discerned at the @xmath4 level after sufficient smoothing .",
    "we find that all extra - galactic hipass targets display emission .",
    "this result is based on data from four observing runs , comprising 90 extra - galactic hipass targets ( this excludes two frames which targeted high velocity clouds and one frame strongly affected by twilight sky ) .",
    "the result is summarized in fig .",
    "all hipass targets are comprised of at least one  emitting galaxy , defined as a spatially extended and distinct source in the  and/or @xmath2 image having readily detected net  emission . in all cases ,",
    "much of the  emission is organized into knots or high surface brightness concentrations   regions or starbursts .",
    "hence , all targets are undergoing some star formation .",
    "while extra - galactic  imaging surveys often turn up sources that were previously uncataloged in optical surveys , free - floating  sources with no optical counterpart are rare ( zwaan _ et  al . _  1997",
    "; ryan - weber _",
    "et  al . _",
    "one possible exception is hipass j1712 - 64 ( kilborn _ et  al._2000 ) .",
    "however , even in this case the possibility that this may be an extreme version of an hvc bound to our galaxy has not been ruled out .",
    "the dearth of free - floating extra - galactic  may be due to the fact that when there is sufficient  for a gas cloud to be self gravitating , it is gravitationally unstable until some stars form so that they can heat the ism enough to arrest further star formation .",
    "low mass  clouds that are not self - gravitating would have low column density and are susceptible to ionization by the uv background ( zwaan _ et  al . _",
    "so  is either associated with stars or destroyed .",
    "our results allow a stronger statement - dormant galaxies are rare or do not exist .",
    "that is , if a galaxy has an ism with @xmath8 it also has _",
    "recently _ ( within 10 myr ) formed high mass stars . the gravitational instability in the ism is not halted by feedback from evolved stellar populations .",
    "instead new stars continue to form , including the massive stars that ionize  regions .",
    "while some star formation is always found , the range of star formation morphologies wide .",
    "we find low surface brightness dwarfs with a few faint  regions , giant spirals with morphologies ranging from flocculent to grand - design , high central surface brightness starbursts ( discussed below ) , and residual star formation in early type disk galaxies .",
    "singg also finds many multiple sources , particularly for @xmath9 ( fig 2a . ) .",
    "the higher multiplicity fraction , may in part be due to the generally larger distance of the highest mass sources and thus larger projected field .",
    "in many cases the companions are obvious , having similar angular extent and a merging , colliding or interacting morphology .",
    "in other cases the companions are less obvious small sources , easily mistaken for field galaxies , save for their  emission .",
    "i conclude that narrow band imaging is an effective means to locate companion galaxies .",
    "the singg images also frequently reveal unresolved emission line sources projected far from the primary  source on the frame .",
    "the images alone are incapable of discriminating what these emission line dots , or `` eldots '' are .",
    "possibilities include outer disk or halo  regions ( ferguson , _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1998 ) , very faint companion galaxies ( e.g.  similar to those proposed by blitz _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1999 ) , or background emission line galaxies ( boroson , salzer &  trotter 1993 ) . in her contribution , emma ryan - weber presents results from our first spectroscopic follow - up observations of eldots .",
    "starburst galaxies are systems which are experiencing a short duration episode of intense star formation . beyond this statement",
    "the term starburst is not really well defined in the literature .",
    "the singg sample selection has netted many well known galaxies which have been called starbursts .",
    "these include m83 , ngc  1705 , ngc  1808 , and ngc  5253 .",
    "all have high central surface brightness , and frequently have a galactic wind morphology .",
    "one goal of singg is to provide an objectively defined starburst sample .",
    "we will look at three quantities often used to define starbursts :  equivalent width , , effective  surface brightness , , and gas consumption timescale , . a high  indicates a large sfr compared to the past average .",
    "high values of  indicates currently intense star formation .",
    "a short  indicates that star formation can not continue for long at its present rate",
    ". hence the three measures of star formation are complementary .",
    "our plan is to use the well known starbursts in the sample as a training set to determine the best cuts in these quantities for our objectively defined starburst sample .",
    "currently we have defined a sample of starbursts by .",
    "the incidence of these starbursts as a function  is given in fig .",
    "the sample includes well known starbursts , and sources selected to have similar surface brightness .",
    "this yields a a first pass starburst incidence rate of @xmath10% of singg targets containing at least one starburst galaxy .",
    "to address the incidence rate of extra - planar , or outflows , we have compiled a database of the largest possibly expanding structures in each galaxy .",
    "these have morphologies including bubbles , rays or chimneys , and edge - brightened and filled fans with or without caps .",
    "the database notes whether the source is in the center ( i.e.  a galactic wind ) or outer regions ( e.g.  a fountain or chimney ) of the galaxy , the source s radius @xmath11 and orientation relative to the host s minor axis , its morphology and finally whether the source is seen in emission ( almost all cases ) or continuum absorption ( just a few cases ) . in order to focus on extra - planar ism we limited ourselves to structures with a minor axis extension , and with hosts having axial ratio @xmath12 .",
    "we considered two samples , structures having @xmath13 kpc , and those with @xmath14 kpc .",
    "we limit ourselves to sources with @xmath15 so that the structures are well resolved , hence the two samples are distance limited to within 21 and 42 mpc respectively ( @xmath16 ) .    figure 3a and 3b show  histograms of the  emitting galaxies meeting the distance and @xmath17 cuts for the two samples .",
    "sources are distinguished by whether the largest expanding structure is central or in the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "nearly half of the hosts have extra - planar structures with @xmath13 kpc , while about a quarter have structures larger than 1.0 kpc .",
    "the galaxies with extra - planar  are not all starbursts .",
    "this is true even if we limit ourselves to just the cases with central outflows , which are also found in galaxies with modest values of .",
    "the histograms imply that the central outflows tend to be in lower hosts , while larger mass systems tend to host fountains .",
    "however , we have found high  mass  emitting galaxies that have strong galactic winds that just do nt quite make our distance and @xmath17 cuts .",
    "one case is the well known central starburst in ngc  1808 ( @xmath18 ) which is one of the two cases where the outflow is best traced by dust lanes .",
    "however , its @xmath19 , is too round to make our selection .",
    "the three galaxies with the largest galactic winds ( @xmath20 to 12 kpc ) seen in the database are all contained within a single hickson compact group ( hcg  16 , combined @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , with @xmath22 mpc , it does not make our distance cut .",
    "these examples show that there are indeed high mass systems with central galactic winds , however we need a larger sample to find them in statistically significant quantities .",
    "the strategy of singg is to survey for star formation in the galaxies known to contain its essential ingredient , interstellar hydrogen , i.e.  we know where the fuel is ; that s where to look for the fire .",
    "this has proven to be a very effective approach , since we find that there are no dormant galaxies : when a galaxy has @xmath23 it is observed to be undergoing some star formation .",
    "the amount of does not prove to be a good predictor of star formation morphology which varies greatly at fixed .",
    "about 15%  of  selected galaxies are starbursts .",
    "extra - planar  also appears to be a common phenomenon with half of edge - on galaxies having features with a radius @xmath24 kpc , and about a quarter having a radius @xmath25 kpc .",
