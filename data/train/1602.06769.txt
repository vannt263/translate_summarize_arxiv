    "ongoing relativistic heavy ion collisions provide enough indications of the formation of the deconfined state of hadronic matter called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the nuclear matter under extreme conditions has been a subject of scrutiny .",
    "recent studies @xcite have revealed a captivating nature of non - central heavy ion collisions ( hic ) .",
    "it indicated that in such collisions , a very strong anisotropic magnetic field is generated in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane , due to the relative motion of the ions themselves .",
    "the initial magnitude of this magnetic field can be very high ( @xmath1 at rhic and @xmath2 at lhc ) at the time of the collision and then it decreases very fast , being inversely proportional to the square of time @xcite .",
    "the presence of an external anisotropic field in the medium subsequently requires modification of the present theoretical tools that can be applied appropriately to investigate various properties of qgp .",
    "an intense research activity is underway to study the properties of strongly interacting matter in presence of an external magnetic field : resulting the emergence of several novel phenomena , _",

    "this suggests that there is clearly an increasing demand to study the effects of intense background magnetic fields on various aspects and observables of non - central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we know that the energy levels ( orbital ) of a moving charged particle in presence of a magnetic field get discretized , which are known as the landau levels ( ll )",
    ". one fascinating prospect of having a very strong background magnetic field is that only the lowest landau level ( lll ) , whose energy is independent of the strength of the magnetic field , remains active in that situation .",
    "that is why , the lll dynamics becomes solely important in the strong magnetic field approximation and the higher order contributions , _",
    "i.e _ , the radiative corrections play a significant role in this context , as it is the only way to get the @xmath3 dependence in the lll energy .",
    "one primary ingredients of the theoretical tools for studying various properties of qgp is the @xmath4-point correlation function , which eventually determines the laws of propagation and the thermodynamic potential . among them",
    "the electromagnetic correlation function is of particular interest because it is related to various physical quantities associated with the deconfined state of matter .",
    "as for example the production rate of real and virtual photons ( dilepton pairs therefrom ) , which leave the fireball with minimum interaction .",
    "these electromagnetic probes are produced in every stages of the hics .",
    "the dilepton spectra is a space - time integrated observable which has contributions coming from various stages of the collisions .",
    "even though the dilepton may carry almost undistorted information of the stages they are produced , it would be very difficult to disentangle the contribution from different stages .",
    "processes like cyclotron emission which are usually abandoned in vacuum become active in presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "these processes affect the photon propagation and thus the spectral function .",
    "the spectral function or the spectral discontinuity of the electromagnetic correlator is directly related to the production rate of dileptons and photons . in vacuum , a full description of polarization tensor in presence of an external magnetic field have already been studied  @xcite . in this article",
    "we , first , would like to obtain the spectral representation of the electromagnetic correlation function in presence of a strong background magnetic field at finite temperature . as a spectral property",
    "we then calculate the dilepton rate which is of immense importance especially in the scenario of non - cnetral heavy - ion collisions . at this point",
    "we note that the dilepton production rate under extreme magnetic fields have been addressed earlier by tuchin  @xcite in a more phenomenological way . in order to estimate the dilepton production with logarithmic accuracy  @xcite ,",
    "a semi - classical weiszcker - williams method  @xcite was employed to obtain the dilepton production rate by a hard quark as a convolution of the real photon decay rate with the flux of equivalent photons emitted by a fast quark . in this calculation",
    "it was approximated that the virtuality of photon has neglibible effect on photon emission and on dilepton production .",
    "recently , sadooghi and taghinavaz  @xcite have analyzed in details the dilepton production rate for magnetized hot and dense medium in a formal field theoretic approach using ritus eigenfunction method  @xcite . in this article",
    "we use such formal field theoretic approach along with schwinger method  @xcite to obtain the electromagnetic spectral function and the dilepton rate in strong field approximation and compare our results with those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition we also discuss another interesting topic , namely the debye screening , which could reveal some of the intriguing properties of the medium in presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ dil ] we discuss how the dilepton rate for lll approximation would be modified and calculate the analytic expression for the dilepton production rate for various scenarios  @xcite in the strong magnetic field approximation .",

    "these landau levels can affect the quantum fluctuations of the charged fermions in the dirac sea at @xmath19 and thermal fluctuations at @xmath20 , both of which arise as a response to the polarization of the electromagnetic field .",
    "these fluctuations are usually related to the electromagnetic polarization tensor or the self energy of photon , which in one loop level is expressed as _ ( p ) = -i_f q_f^2 _ c , [ pola ] where @xmath21 is the external momentum , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the loop momenta .",

    "when the external magnetic field is very strong  @xcite , @xmath31 , it pushes all the landau levels ( @xmath32 ) to infinity compared to the lowest landau level ( lll ) with @xmath33 . for lll approximation in the strong field limit the fermion propagator in ( [ decomposed_propagator ] ) reduces to a simplified form as    is_ms(k)=ie^-k_^2/q_fb  ( 1-i_1_2 ) , [ prop_sfa ] where @xmath22 is four momentum and we have used the properties of generalized laguerre polynomial , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "the motion of the charged particle is restricted in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field but can move along the field direction in lll .",
    "this effective dimensional reduction also plays an important role in catalyzing the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite since the fermion pairing takes place in lll , which enhances the generation of fermionic mass through the chiral condensate in strong field limit at @xmath19 .",
    "the pairing dynamics is essentially ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional where the fermion pairs fluctuate in the direction of magnetic field .",
    "it is also interesting to see how these fermionic pairs respond to the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the fluctuation of fermion pairs in lll as shown in fig .",
    "[ sfa_self_energy ] is a response to the polarization of the electromagnetic field and would reveal various properties of the system in presence of magnetic field .",
    "also the response to the electromagnetic field at @xmath20 due to the thermal fluctuation of charged fermion pairs in lll would also be very relevant for the initial stages of the noncentral heavy - ion collisions where the intensity of the generated magnetic field is very high .",

    "in ref.@xcite the ward - takahasi identity in lll for fermion - antifermion - gauge boson in massless qed in presence of constant magnetic field was shown to be satisfied by considering the effective fermion propagator , bare vertex and free gauge boson propagator in ladder approximation through dyson - schwinger approach in a representation where the fermion mass operator is diagonal in momentum space . ] and denoted by a crossed circle . as mentioned earlier that the spin of the fermions in lll are aligned in the direction of the magnetic field because of the projection operator in ( [ prop_sfa ] ) . in qed like vertex with two fermions from lll",
    "make the photon spin equals to zero in the field direction  @xcite and there is no polarization in the transverse direction .",

    "interestingly @xmath45 is singular in presence of magnetic field at this threshold .",
