    "[ vaisb ] ) , and an exponential decreasing outwards in the evanescent regions ( magenta in fig .",
    "[ vaisb ] ) .",
    "[ xih ] ( left panel ) shows that this formula applies well for the mode @xmath10 , g@xmath27 .",
    "the propagation region is very large for this mode going up to the iob , the change of amplitude of @xmath25 is dominated there by the factor @xmath31 which leads to values much smaller near the center compared to the surface .",

    "this can be understood as follows . at high frequencies ,",
    "the eigenfunctions do not depend significantly on @xmath33 .",

    "this corresponds to a lower frequency for @xmath11 compared to @xmath10 modes ( compare the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ vaisb ] ) .",
    "hence the critical frequency at which the upper boundary of the propagation region reachs the iob is smaller for @xmath11 modes . at this smaller frequency ,",
    "the transition region where the pulsation period is of the same order as the thermal relaxation time is deeper in the star , around the hot side of the iob ; so the damping effect of this region is larger than the driving of the more superficial layers ( red curves in the right bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ work ] ) and all high order g - modes are stable .",
    "@xcite showed that many more hybrid @xmath0  cep - spb are predicted when op opacity tables ( @xcite ) are used compared with opal ( @xcite ) .",

    "but the results are different for the high order g - modes : with op they are excited while most are stable with opal . to understand this",
    ", i recall that two things are required for an efficient driving of the g - modes .",
    "first , the transition region where the pulsation period is of the same order as the thermal relaxation time must coincides with the iob . and",
    "second , this period must be large enough so that the corresponding evanescent region is negligible .",
    "these two requirements are fulfilled with op ; but with opal the period at which the transition region and the iob coincide is too small , leading to a too large evanescent region .",

    "we used for the non - adiabatic computation the time - dependent convection ( tdc ) treatment of @xcite .",
    "the mode @xmath11 , p@xmath42 ( blue , @xmath49 c / d ) is a typical unstable mode of @xmath1  sct type ; tdc plays a central role in its driving and damping .",
    "the mode @xmath11 , g@xmath44 ( red , @xmath50 c / d ) is a typical unstable mode of @xmath2  dor type ; the small driving at @xmath51 comes from a @xmath7-mechanism in the iob and the significant driving at @xmath52 is a flux blocking mechanism operating a the base of the convective envelope .",

    "[ workdsgd ] that the sizes of the propagation and evanescent regions for these modes are similar to the case of b stars considered above .",
    "hence , the explanation of the stable gap between the @xmath1  sct and @xmath2  dor unstable modes is the same as before : these g - modes of intermediate radial order have a large evanescent region ; hence the amplitudes are large in the deep g - mode cavity , and the radiative damping occurring there is much larger than the driving of the superficial layers .",
    "we note that the model considered here is very young , without region of variable molecular weight above the convective core .",
    "hence , no bump of the brunt - visl frequency is present there . in fig .",

    "we note that the stable gap between the @xmath1  sct and @xmath2  dor unstable modes decreases as @xmath33 increases .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that @xmath54 , so that the size of the propagation cavity of g - modes increases with @xmath33 for a given frequency .",
    "theoretical models and observations indicate the existence of hybrid models having at the same time unstable pressure and gravity modes . concerning first the driving mechanism of hybrid @xmath0  cep - spb models we have shown , in addition to its already known sensitivity to the iron abundance , that the characteristics of the propagation and evanescent regions also play a major role in this context , determining the extension of the stable gap in the frequency domain between the unstable low order pressure and high order gravity modes .",
