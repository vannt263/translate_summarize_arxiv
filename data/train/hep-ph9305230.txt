    "<S> more details regarding the phenomenological implications of this model in comparison with the mssm will be given elsewhere.@xcite    in conclusion , we have shown in this paper that the requirement of supersymmetry does not uniquely determine the self - interaction structure ( and thus the mass spectrum ) of the two higgs doublets at the electroweak energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that there may be one or more terms in the superpotential linking the two higgs - doublet superfields with a heavier superfield , as allowed by a larger symmetry at a higher mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced higgs potential at the electroweak energy scale remembers these couplings and would only be identical to that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) if these additional couplings were zero . [ </S>",
    "<S> the hidden assumption of the mssm is in fact the absence of such couplings . ]    </S>",

    "<S> , we specialize to the case @xmath104 and discuss how the higgs mass spectrum of this model differs from that of the mssm . if future experiments confirm the existence of two and only two higgs doublets at the electroweak energy scale , it will be very important to know whether they are consistent with supersymmetry and we should bear in mind that the mssm is not the only possibility .    acknowledgement    the work of e.m . </S>",
