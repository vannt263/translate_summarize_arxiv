    "the recent progress of quantum computing with electron and nuclear spins in doped si  @xcite , with demonstrated record coherence in the solid state  @xcite , has been astonishing . in spite of this , the intrinsically weak spin - orbit interaction of the conduction electrons with the host si nuclei  @xcite and the relatively tight wave functions of the donor electrons  @xcite can seriously restrict the extent to which the qubit states can be selectively controlled .",
    "moreover , coupling two donor spins in si requires the ions to be implanted very closely  @xcite , and with high precision  @xcite .",
    "while retaining the compatibility with integrated circuits , ge spins can be efficiently controlled electrically , thanks to the stronger spin - orbit interaction : theoretical predictions of high @xmath2-factor tunability of conduction band electrons in ge - based heterostructures  @xcite have been confirmed by very recent experiments  @xcite . despite this decreased spin isolation , recent electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements of isotopically - purified - ge donors have shown promising coherence times @xmath3@xmath4ms  @xcite . furthermore , ge has been considered as a candidate host for transistor processing in the quantum regime  @xcite , and the technical development in device fabrication parallels the more popular si electronics  @xcite .",
    "we are thus motivated to develop a complete theory of electron states of ge donors , with the aim of predicting whether and by how much this new semiconductor platform could improve and facilitate the control of single and two donor qubits .",
    "extensive esr experiments with ge : p , ge : as and ge : bi donors at low temperature were already performed by wilson  @xcite in the 60s . however , the theoretical understanding of ge donors is not well developed : the most modern approaches to describing the electron orbital states date back to the 70s  @xcite , with a satisfactory theory still missing to date .",
    "nonetheless , a detailed picture is crucial for deciding whether ge - donor spins could make promising qubits , and for anticipating the most desirable regimes for spin manipulation in such devices . in this paper",
    ", we provide for the first time a thorough description of shallow ge - donors from group v , based on an improved multi - valley effective mass theory ( mv - emt ) that includes the strong anisotropy of the conduction band and approximates phenomenologically the interaction between the donor electron and the nucleus  @xcite . unlike in most of the traditional emt papers , here",
    "the full plane - wave expansion of the bloch states of the pure ge crystal is included : this provides a crucial step for developing a unified picture across different donor chemical species .",
    "we then model dc gate control of the spin resonance frequencies  @xcite , by calculating the susceptibilities of both the hyperfine and the zeeman splittings for all group v donors .",
    "close agreement with the contemporary experimental measurements of ge : as by sigillito _",
    ".   validates our estimates of the electrical tuning of donor spin splitting .",
    "we predict that single qubit gates with ge : p donors could be performed with nanosecond timescales under realistic assumptions , a huge improvement to the si framework .",
    "this effect was partially anticipated by earlier _",
    "ab initio _ treatments in ref .  , but we improve those predictions with quantitative matching of experiments , and extend them to all donors with a more clear understanding of the underlining physics .",
    "we further move on to calculate for the first time the exchange couplings @xmath5 between adjacent ge - donor spins , and quantify how their larger wave functions allow the stringent pitch requirements of si - donors placement to be relaxed by a factor of three .",
    "remarkably , we show that , in the optimal geometric configuration , @xmath5 couplings between pairs of ge - donors will depend less than those in si on 3d implantation misplacements .",
    "uniform control of large , strongly coupled qubit clusters thus promises to be significantly easier in ge , which we predict to be more robust in the face of the problems of spin coupling intrinsic to multi - valley semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "the lowest conduction band in ge has four equivalent minima ( valleys ) @xmath6 , each located at the edge of the brillouin zone along one of the equivalent crystallographic @xmath7 directions in @xmath8 space , the so - called @xmath9 points  @xcite .",
    "we will choose @xmath10 , where @xmath11 nm is the crystal lattice constant  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of a conduction electron in the undoped ge crystal is thus four - fold degenerate as regards the orbital degree of freedom .",
    "however , the implantation of a substitutional atom from group v partially breaks the crystal symmetry , as the hamiltonian @xmath12 of the donor electron includes an extra term @xmath13 , that describes its interaction with the impurity ion .",
    "effective mass theory ( emt ) maintains that the donor quantum states can still be expanded in terms of packets of bloch functions whose @xmath14-vectors concentrate around each minimum , since the wave function is known to spread across tens of lattice constants in space .",
    "while this approximation fails to accurately describe the behavior of the donor electron wave function within the crystal cell occupied by the binding substitutional impurity ( the _ central cell _ ) , it does not impede a reliable picture outside of it , if one averages the short - range hamiltonian with a pseudopotential  @xcite .",
    "importantly , both single and two - qubit manipulations of donor spins rely on the long - range component of the donor wave function , since it is this part that is affected by external control fields and/or overlap with neighboring donor states .    over the years",
    ", emt has been improved from its original single - valley formulation  @xcite to a multi - valley framework  @xcite , which aims at describing how all valleys are admixed in the electron eigenstates as a result of the donor - dependent impurity potential @xmath13 .",
    "the most important consequences for the electron ground state are that it is non - degenerate , and its orbital energy and hyperfine coupling to the ion differ significantly from a single - valley state  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical progress in the understanding of si - donors has not been paralleled by adequate investigation of ge - donors , where the electron wave functions are more spread out because of both stronger dielectric screening from the crystal and smaller average effective mass of the lowest conduction band .",
    "this is evident if one compares the rescaled effective rydberg energies and transverse bohr radii of the orbital states in si ( @xmath15 nm , @xmath16 mev ) and ge ( @xmath17 nm , @xmath18 mev ) .    we now present the most important steps that lead to the final multi - valley emt equations that we are going to use , starting from the exact schrdinger equation for a donor electron in bulk ge : @xmath19\\psi(\\textbf{r})= \\epsilon \\psi(\\textbf{r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the wave function of the donor electron , @xmath21 is its rest mass , @xmath22 is the periodic potential of the undoped ge crystal , and @xmath23 labels any energy eigenvalue .",
    "emt dictates that @xmath20 be expanded as a sum of the bloch functions of the conduction electrons in undoped ge @xmath24 , each weighted with envelopes @xmath25 that decay rapidly as their argument gets farther from each of the four valleys @xmath6  @xcite : @xmath26 where we have conveniently defined @xmath27 as the total contribution of each envelope centered at @xmath6 , and @xmath28 are valley coefficients that can be predicted by symmetry arguments alone  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the four - fold @xmath29 valley manifold can be grouped into a singlet @xmath30 and a triplet @xmath3 : @xmath31 a further step of emt is to encode the hamiltonian of the pure crystal in an effective mass tensor specific to the lowest conduction band : this contributes an anisotropic kinetic energy operator @xmath32 for each @xmath33 valley . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the momentum operator of the donor electron , and @xmath35 is a diagonal tensor in a basis with one vector parallel to @xmath33 and two vectors orthogonal to it ( e.g. , if @xmath36 $ ] , one could choose the basis @xmath37,[10\\bar{1}],[111]\\}$ ] ) , with entries @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 @xmath21 and @xmath41 @xmath21 .",
    "we are thus ready , following ref .  , to take the expectation values of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqbase ] ) for the wave function in eq .",

    "we have also assumed that @xmath48 , as it is found that these weights vary weakly for small displacements of their arguments .",
    "we combine this multi - valley emt with a pseudopotential method to describe the impurity potential @xmath13 , an approach that has been applied successfully to understand some properties of donor electron states in si  @xcite .",
    "the use of a smooth pseudopotential in place of the true impurity potential implies that the eigenstates of the corresponding hamiltonian are not accurate on the scale of the central cell  @xcite , where strong oscillations impede the semi - analytic description we are aiming at .",
    "however , the pseudo - wave function averages the short - ranged behaviour and matches it consistently with the more accurate picture farther from the nucleus .",
    "the past decades have seen a plethora of functional forms proposed for the impurity pseudopotential , whereby few adjustable parameters were tuned until the low - energy donor states matched one or more experimental binding energies .",
    "however , we recently pointed out that the variational solutions of the corresponding pseudo - hamiltonians are not fundamentally granted to provide sensible descriptions of the donor _ eigenstates _ of the problem in eq .",
    "( [ eqbase ] ) , although they can give reliable upper bounds to its exact _ _ eigenvalues__@xcite . in order to assess donor architectures for quantum computing",
    ", enough accuracy is needed in the description of some key features of the donor wave function , while at the same time keeping the theoretical framework light enough that those features can be flexibly evaluated within different realistic environments .",
    "thus we suggested that , within an analytical mv - emt / pseudopotential framework , the tunable parameters in @xmath13 should also fit the hyperfine coupling to the impurity ion , in order to constrain the average short - ranged behaviour of the pseudo - state , and , crucially , to improve the description of the eigenstates .",
    "we require , then , a phenomenological pseudopotential which is the simplest possible that allows for a unified and accurate framework across all donors .",
    "we find that the following short - ranged pseudopotential with spherical symmetry of the form : @xmath49 meets our needs . here",
    ", @xmath50 is the static dielectric constant for ge , @xmath51 is the elementary charge , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are two donor - dependent parameters that will be fit , once for all , to the experimental binding energies and hyperfine coupling .    unlike our previous work on si donors in ref .  , we find that a consistent picture requires an important further improvement , as we now explain .",
    "most of the previous emt approaches go on to neglect the @xmath54 terms of the plane - wave expansion of the bloch states @xmath55",
    "@xcite , as they mostly multiply higher fourier components of the impurity potential in eq .",
    "( [ definitiva ] ) . however , it is not always true that these terms are less important than the @xmath56 terms , and this approximation has been criticized  @xcite .",
    "the assumption is particularly questionable for ge donors , since the most important bloch states @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ waveexpansion ] ) in ge are even farther from @xmath58 than in si .",
    "thus , umklapp scattering terms from the periodic lattice potential are more important , as it is easier for reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath59 to ` resonantly ' match differences @xmath60 between two momenta belonging to separate brillouin zones .",
    "the inter - valley weights @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) with @xmath54 are thus expected to be more significant , as direct pseudopotential calculations show  @xcite .",
    "our solution is to include the full bloch structure of the donor states : the list of the relevant weights @xmath63 has been evaluated in ref .   after a pseudopotential calculation of the band structure of the undoped ge crystal  @xcite .",
    "we report the relevant results in table  [ tab : intervalleycoupling ] for convenience . specifically , we neglect those terms that either have vanishing weights ( @xmath64 ) or that sample very high fourier components @xmath65 and are thus negligible .",
