    "since the development of @xmath12 factories like belle and bes a wealth of data on new hadronic states has been produced  @xcite , information which is crucial to understand the nature and properties of such states .",
    "particularly interesting are the data on the so called exotic charmonium states .",
    "one member of this family , and probably the most widely studied theoretically , is the @xmath3 ( from now on simply @xmath11 ) , reported a decade ago by the belle collaboration in the decay @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "after this finding , several other collaborations @xcite confirmed this state and its existence is now established beyond any doubt .",
    "however , it has only been very recently when the spin - parity quantum numbers of @xmath11 have been confirmed to be @xmath14  @xcite .    during these years , several theoretical models have been proposed to describe the properties of this state , considering it as a charmonium state , a tetraquark , a @xmath15 hadron molecule and a mixture between a charmonium and a molecular component  @xcite . in spite of the effort of these numerous groups ,",
    "the properties of this particle are not yet well understood and represent a challenge both for theorists and experimentalists .    in line with",
    "the information on new charmonium states brought by the @xmath12 factories , in a different frontier of physics , collaborations like rhic and lhc has devoted a significant part of their physics program to study the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it is now a well accepted fact that in high energy heavy ion collisions a deconfined medium is created : the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . in a high energy heavy ion collision",
    "the qgp is formed , expands , cools , hadronizes and is converted into a hadron gas , which lives up to @xmath16 fm / c and then freezes out . during this evolution ,",
    "an increasing ( with the reaction energy ) number of charm quarks and anti - quarks move freely .",
    "the initially formed charmonium bound states are dissolved ( the famous  charmonium suppression \" ) but @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s , coming now from different parent gluons , can pick up light quarks and anti - quarks from the rich environment and form multiquark bound states . this is called quark coalescence and it happens during the phase transition to the hadronic gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the formation of the quark gluon plasma phase increases the number of produced @xmath11 s @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the coalescence formalism is based on the overlap of the wigner functions of the quarks and of the bound state , being thus sensitive to the spatial configuration of the charmonium state and hence being able to distinguish between a compact , @xmath19 fm long , tetraquark configuration and a large @xmath20 fm long , molecular configuration . a big difference between the predicted abundancies",
    "could be used as a tool to discriminate between different @xmath11 structures and to help us to decide whether it is a molecule or a tetraquark @xcite . in this way",
    ", heavy ion collisions can be used to obtain information about exotic charmonium states as @xmath11 .",
    "however , there is an additional complication . due to the rich hadronic environment present in the plasma",
    ", the @xmath11 s can be destroyed in collisions with ordinary hadrons , such as @xmath21 , and can also be produced through the inverse reactions , such as @xmath22 .",
    "a proper determination of the abundance of @xmath11 in heavy ion collisions requires a precise calculation of the cross sections of these kind of processes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hadronic absorption cross section of the @xmath11 by mesons like @xmath23 and @xmath24 was evaluated for the processes @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . using these cross sections , the variation of the @xmath11 meson abundance during the expansion of the hadronic matter",
    "was computed with the help of a kinetic equation with gain and loss terms .",
    "the results turned out to be strongly dependent on the quantum numbers of the @xmath11 and on its structure .",
    "the present work is devoted to introduce two improvements in the calculation of cross sections performed in ref .",
    "the first and most important one is the inclusion of the anomalous vertices @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which were neglected before . with these vertices new reaction channels",
    "become possible , such as @xmath32 , and the inverse process @xmath33 . as will be seen",
    ", this reaction is the most important one for @xmath11 in the hadron gas .",
    "the relevance of anomalous couplings has also been shown earlier in different contexts , for example in the @xmath34 absorption cross sections by @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons  @xcite , radiative decays of scalar resonances and axial vector mesons  @xcite and in kaon photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the second improvement is the inclusions of the charged components of the @xmath35 and @xmath7 mesons which couple to the @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "to calculate the cross section for the processes ( 1 ) @xmath36 , ( 2 ) @xmath37 and ( 3 ) @xmath38 we consider the model of refs .",
    "@xcite in which @xmath11 is generated from the interaction of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "@xcite the authors studied the radiative decay modes of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 resonances , finding that the diagrams involving anomalous couplings were quite important for most of the decays , particularly for the @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    summarizing this subsection",
