    "the broader line wings of h@xmath6 and ca  ii likely arise from multiple scattering by thermal electrons in the dense wind ( e.g. , chugai 2001 ) . integrating the light curve in figure 1 and assuming zero bolometric correction ,",

    "the peak of sn  2008s approaches the bottom end of the luminosity distribution for core - collapse sne  ii .",

    "sn  2008s , in contrast , shows a relatively linear decline from peak with no clear transition of this type .",

    "however , figure  [ fig : one ] shows only the @xmath13 magnitude with _ no bolometric correction_. the day 270 spectrum has a very red continuum peaking at @xmath271  @xmath30 even after correcting for reddening , so the substantial bolometric correction raises the luminosity by @xmath30.5 mag and makes the true decay rate about 0.06 mag day@xmath2  almost half that of @xmath1co",
    ". the late - time decline rate of a sn can be faster than the @xmath1co decay rate with energy leakage , but it can not be slower if radioactivity is the source .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the late - time luminosity of sn  2008s is powered by radioactive decay .",
    "furthermore , the spectral evolution of sn  2008s is unlike those of the class of weak core - collapse sne , all of which exhibit remakably homogeneous spectral properties ( pastorello et al.2004 ) .",

    "the smooth continuum and bright narrow emission lines of h and ca  ii at all times in sn  2008s are quite unlike the strong absorption lines and broad p  cyg profiles observed in the photospheres of faint core - collapse sne ( see sn  2005cs in fig .",

    "finally , sn  2008s did not show the characteristic transition from photospheric to nebular phases seen in the low - luminosity sne  ii ; instead , its day 270 spectrum was almost identical to , although redder than , its spectrum near peak .",
    "thus , we find that the spectrum of sn  2008s did not arise from a recombination front receding through expanding and cooling ejecta , as in weak core - collapse sne  ii .",

    "thompson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) raised the question of whether sn  2008s and the ngc  300 transient may have been electron - capture sne ( ecsne ) from stars of initial mass @xmath39 m@xmath8 . while it is admittely unclear exactly what the observed properties of ecsne should be , one might expect an ecsn from a 9  m@xmath8 super - asymptotic - giant branch star to resemble a weak core - collapse sn in a @xmath310 m@xmath8 red supergiant , since both have rapidly expanding h envelopes with similar mass . indeed , some authors have proposed that the class of weak sne  ii - p may be ecsne ( chugai & utrobin 2000 ; hendry et al .",
    "2005 ; kitaura et al .",
    "since the observed parameters of sn  2008s are quite distinct from those of the weak sne  ii , as discussed above , we consider it unlikely that sn  2008s was an ecsn .    on the other hand ,",
    "the low peak luminosity of sn  2008s is consistent with the observed range for sn impostors . despite differences in the progenitor stars , the light curve of sn  2008s closely matches that of the sn impostor sn  1997bs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) , for which the progenitor and surviving star were detected ( van dyk et al .  2000 ;",
    "but see li et al .",
    "similarly , the slow expansion speeds , strong balmer lines , and smooth continuum match those observed in nearby lbvs and other sn impostors , supporting our earlier conjecture that sn  2008s was not a core - collapse sn ( steele et al .",
    "the eddington parameter , @xmath32 , is the factor by which a star exceeds the classical eddington limit , assuming that thomson scattering ( @xmath33 ) dominates the opacity .",
    "with such a high value of @xmath34 l@xmath8 , sn  2008s would have @xmath7 ( @xmath35/20 m@xmath36 .",
    "this huge eddington parameter is a factor of @xmath310 higher than that of @xmath10 car during its 1843 eruption , when the star shed @xmath310 m@xmath8 in a few years ( smith et al .",
    "this high eddington ratio may hint that the sn  2008s event was explosive , although that does not necessarily imply that it was not an lbv - like event .",
    "for example , the same 1843 eruption of @xmath10 car produced a fast blast wave of @xmath35,000 km s@xmath2 and @xmath310@xmath28 ergs ( see smith 2008 ) .",
    "we point out an uncanny similarity between the visual - wavelength spectra of sn  2008s near peak luminosity and the spectrum of the galactic hypergiant star irc+10420 ( see fig .  [ fig : two ] ) . both objects exhibit a smooth continuum dominated by narrow h@xmath6 , [ ca  ii ] , and ca  ii emission . such strong , narrow ca  ii emission lines have not been seen before in a sn or sn impostor , and are extremely rare among known stars .",
    "the strong ca  ii and [ ca  ii ] lines have not been seen in sne iin where the radiation is produced by shock interaction with a dense csm .",
    "irc+10420 is an evolved massive star in a yellow ( spectral type of mid - a ) hypergiant phase with strong mass loss ( humphreys , davidson , & smith 2002 ) .",
    "this phase may be a counterpart to the lbvs at cooler @xmath18 ( smith et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "this spectral similarity between sn  2008s and irc+10420 does not necessarily mean that the objects are in the same evolutionary phase .",
    "although irc+10420 has experienced strong variability in the past 30 years , it is not currently in a giant eruption .",
    "nevertheless , the similarity does indicate similar values of @xmath18 for sn  2008s in outburst and irc+10420 in its current quiescent state .",
    "it also demonstrates that the observed spectrum of sn  2008s can plausibly originate in an opaque and turbulent wind , because this is known to be the case for irc+10420 , whereas no such precedent exists for core - collapse sne .",
    "irc+10420 s mass - loss rate is estimated as @xmath37 m@xmath8 yr@xmath2 ( see humphreys et al .",
    "the ca  ii lines imply that both irc+10420 and the progenitor of sn  2008s are ( or were ) obscured by dust ( jones et al .",
    "1993 ; prieto et al .",
    "2008 ) , since one potential explanation for the unusually strong ca  ii lines is that radiation from sn  2008s might have vaporized grains that were previously in equilibrium around a less luminous progenitor .",
    "effective temperatures around 7500  k in both objects imply an interesting regime where h is recombining , with serious consequences in a wind driven by radiation force .",
    "as such , the classical electron - scattering eddington limit may be altered in the outermost layers of the star or inner wind .",
    "if h recombines in the outflow , the opacity will drop and the radiation field may no longer be able to effectively impart momentum to the outflowing material .",
    "an inhomogeneous wind may stall or partly fail , and some material may fall back onto the star , as has been suggested for irc+10420 ( humphreys et al .",
    "recent numerical simulations of super - eddington winds show a complex pattern of outflow and infall ( van marle , owocki , & shaviv 2008 ) .",
    "the general character of the winds in these simulations closely matches the situation we envision for sn  2008s , although it is difficult to evaluate this comparison quantitatively . if our suggested picture of a failed super - eddington wind is applicable , we might expect high - resolution spectra of the h@xmath6 and ca  ii lines to reveal signatures of simultaneous outflow and infall such as inverse p  cyg features , and asymmetric or double - peaked profiles caused by self absorption .",
    "these have in fact been seen in irc+10420 ( oudmaijer 1998 ; humphreys et al .  2002 ) .",
    "following our initial prediction , these types of line profiles were indeed shown in higher - resolution spectra of the related transient in ngc  300 ( berger et al .",
    "2009 ; bond et al .",
    "unfortunately , our low - dispersion spectra do not resolve the detailed line - profile shapes in sn  2008s itself . a super - eddington wind with @xmath38 can drive strong mass loss , with rates up to @xmath30.1 m@xmath8 yr@xmath2 ( owocki et al .  2004 ) . if the ratio of radiated energy to kinetic energy is near unity , as in @xmath10 car ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ; smith 2006 ) , then we might expect an ejected mass of @xmath30.16@xmath390.05 @xmath5 .",
    "the lbv outburst phenomenon has been observed to occur in stars with initial masses down to about 20 m@xmath8 ( e.g. , smith et al.2004 ) . for the lower mass range ,",
    "the instability is thought to result from heavy mass loss as a red supergiant ( rsg ) , so that the stars have high @xmath40 ratios in post - rsg blue loops ( see smith et al .",
    "if a similar mechanism operates in sn  2008s , as we suggest , then the relatively low initial mass of 1020 m@xmath8 inferred for the progenitor star by prieto et al .",
    "( 2008 ) has important implications .",
    "it tells us that the phenomenon of episodic pre - sn mass loss seen in lbvs can extend to even lower - mass stars than previously thought , perhaps down to 15 m@xmath8 or less . at such low masses ,",
    "it is not at all clear that the star needs to be a blue supergiant to experience a similar type of non - terminal outburst . the mass loss that caused the self obscuration may have occurred as a rsg with a high @xmath40 value ( heger et al .",
    "1997 ) , possibly initiating the star s consequent instability , whereas is seems likely that the high luminosity of the event itself evaporated most of that dust .",
    "the expected short duration of @xmath41 yr for that preceding phase ( heger et al .",
    "1997 ) satisfies the expectations of thompson et al.(2008 ) that these obscured phases would be short lived .",
    "if sn  2008s was a super - eddington event in a @xmath42  m@xmath8 star , it strengthens the hypothesis that the progenitor of sn  1987a ejected its nebula in a similar outburst ( smith 2007 ) .",
    "thompson et al .  ( 2008 ) proposed that sn  2008s and the similar event in ngc  300 represent a new class of transients , while our observations of the sn  2008s outburst itself imply the somewhat different interpretation that they extend the parameter space of the already diverse class of sn impostor outbursts to include progenitors with lower luminosity than previously thought . since the underlying mechanism that triggers lbv eruptions is still not diagnosed , it is difficult to be certain about the difference in these perspectives .",
    "we suspect that sn  2008s and the transient in ngc  300 are special cases where the progenitors were highly obscured because of recent mass loss and because of their relatively low progenitor mass .",
    "the scenario of a non - terminal explosion or `` sn impostor '' predicts that the star will be detectable again , although it may take decades before the star recovers to thermal equilibrium .",
