    "topological defects often play a fundamental role in our understanding of phases of matter and the transitions between them .",
    "the best understood examples are probably vortices and vortex - loops in superfluids and @xmath2 magnets in two and three dimensions , which are responsible for the very existence of the high - temperature phase , and completely determine the universality class of the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the next in order of complexity are the topological defects in the @xmath3-symmetric heisenberg model , which allows skyrmions in two dimensions  @xcite and hedgehogs - like configurations ( a point defect around which spins point outward ) in three dimensions  @xcite . while the former only renormalize the coupling constant , the role of the latter is less clear  @xcite .",
    "all of the above , however , represent configurations topologically distinct from vacuum , which provides them with local stability .    in this paper , we study the stability of the topologically non - trivial skyrmion configuration in theories with @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "such a symmetry arises in complex condensates with an internal spin-@xmath5-like quantum number  @xcite , for example .",
    "realizations of such _ spinor condensates _ are found in models of inflatory cosmology  @xcite , bose - einstein condensation of @xmath6rb  @xcite , and bosonic ferromagnetism  @xcite , and in effective theories of high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite  and of deconfined criticality  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the weinberg - salam model of electroweak interactions represents another closely related example , with a spinor condensate coupled to gauge fields . in our problem in three dimensions",
    ", there exists a topologically non - trivial mapping to the order - parameter space , thanks to the fact that the _ third _ homotopy group of @xmath7 is the group of integers .",
    "however , the topology alone turns out to be insufficient to guarantee local stability of the skyrmion .",
    "this may be understood already in terms of the classic derick theorem  @xcite .",
    "recently , a more general proof that the skyrmion can not be a stationary point of the action for the spinor bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in free space was given by two of the present authors  @xcite , based on the analogy between the euler - lagrange equations and the classical mechanics of a particle in a time - dependent dissipative environment  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this alternative point of view at the old problem is that it provides one with a simple way of constructing the external potentials which would indeed lead to skyrmion as the solution of the euler - lagrange equations . in ref .",

    ", we further develop this approach .",
    "first we analyze the construction of the solution based on the ansatz proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "a time - dependent dissipation which is odd in time was introduced , to allow an odd solution .",
    "however , we find that the symmetry argument does not always work , and there is a critical dissipation strength above which the odd solution no longer exists even for an odd dissipation .",
    "next , we study the stability of the skyrmion in a generalized class of the potentials introduced in  @xcite with respect to small variations .",
    "we map the problem to an effective quantum - mechanical eigenvalue problem and determine the region of local stability in the parameter space .",
    "a particularly interesting result of our analysis is that the stable skyrmion requires a minimal number of particles in the trap , estimated here to be @xmath1 in the optimal case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ skyrmion_solution ] , we present basic formulation of the problem .",
    "a classical equation of motion with time - dependent dissipation determines the skyrmion solution . on the other hand",
    ", a quantum mechanical eigenvalue problem determines the local stability of the solution . in sec .",
    "[ construction ] , we discuss the construction of the skyrmion solution based on the odd - function ansatz . we determine the critical dissipation strength , which separates the region with and without a skyrmion solution . in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] , we present the numerical solution of the equation of motion for a few cases . the existence of the critical dissipation strength , as well as related theoretical predictions , is confirmed numerically .",
    "furthermore , the local stability of the obtained solution is also analyzed by solving the quantum - mechanical eigenvalue problem .",
    "the minimal number of bosons required to satisfy the sufficient condition for the local stability is numerically obtained as a function of parameter .",
    "section  [ summary ] is devoted to summary of the paper .",
    "we begin by reviewing the derivation of the skyrmion solution for the two - component ( spinor ) bec in an external potential , formulated previously in ref .",
    "the derivation is based on the euler - lagrange equations , and leads to the necessary condition for the existence of the skyrmion solution .",
    "we will then proceed to examine the stability of the skyrmion by taking into account the second - order variation .",
    "let us consider the two - component bosons in three - dimensional continuum space in the external confinement potential @xmath8 .",
    "the system can be described by the following effective action via the path integral formalism  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a two - component bosonic field with the mass @xmath11 , which satisfies the periodic boundary condition @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",

    "next , we introduce the dimensionless parameters and fields by rescaling : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the constant length scale .",
    "effective action ( [ action ] ) may be written now in terms of the dimensionless parameters as @xmath21    let us focus on classical field configurations independent of the imaginary time .",

    "the stationary state also needs to satisfy the boundary condition @xmath33 it guarantees the stability of the solution with respect to small rotations of the spinor @xmath34 at the infinitely remote boundary of the system .",
