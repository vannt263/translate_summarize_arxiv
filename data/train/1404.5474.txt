    "this principle may lead to a giant magnetoresistance effect in external magnetic fields as low as 1 - 10  oe in a magnetic shuttle device if magnets with highly spin - polarized electrons ( half metals @xcite ) are used as leads in a magnetic shuttle device .",
    "the key idea is to use the external magnetic field to manipulate the spin of shuttled electrons rather than the magnetization of the leads .",
    "since the electron spends a relatively long time on the shuttle , where it is decoupled from the magnetic environment , even a weak magnetic can rotate its spin by a significant angle .",
    "such a rotation allows the spin of an electron that has been loaded onto the shuttle from a spin - polarized source electrode to be reoriented in order to allow the electron finally to tunnel from the shuttle to the ( differently ) spin - polarized drain lead . in this way the shuttle serves as a very sensitive  magnetoresistor \" device",
    "the model employed in ref .   assumes that the source and drain are fully polarized in opposite directions .",
    "a mechanically movable quantum dot ( described by a time - dependent displacement @xmath84 ) , where a single energy level is available for electrons , performs driven harmonic oscillations between the leads .",

    "the physical meaning of this relation is simple : every time when @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is the spin precession frequency in a magnetic field ) the shuttled electron is able to flip fully its spin to remove the  spin - blockade \" of tunneling between spin polarized leads having their magnetization in opposite directions .",
    "this effect can be used for measuring the mechanical frequency thus providing dc spectroscopy of nanomechanical vibrations .",
    "spin - dependent shuttling of electrons as discussed above is a property of non - interacting electrons , in the sense that tunneling of different electrons into ( and out of ) the dot are independent events .",
    "the coulomb blockade phenomenon adds a strong correlation of tunneling events , preventing fluctuations in the occupation of electronic states on the dot .",

    "one of the remarkable consequences is the coulomb promotion of spin - dependent tunneling predicted in ref .  .",
    "in this work a strong voltage dependence of the spin - flip relaxation rate on a quantum dot was demonstrated .",
    "such relaxation , being very sensitive to the occupation of spin - up and spin - down states on the dot , can be controlled by the coulomb blockade phenomenon .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that by lifting the coulomb blockade one stimulates occupation of both spin - up and spin - down states thus suppressing spin - flip relaxation on the dot . in magnetic devices with highly spin - polarized electrons",
    "electronic spin - flip can be the only mechanism providing charge transport between oppositely magnetized leads . in this case",
    "the onset of coulomb blockade , by increasing the spin - flip relaxation rate , stimulates charge transport through a magnetic set device ( coulomb promotion of spin - dependent tunneling ) .",
    "spin - flip relaxation also modifies qualitatively the noise characteristics of spin - dependent single - electron transport . in refs .",
    "it was shown that the low - frequency shot noise in such structures diverges as the spin relaxation rate goes to zero .",
    "this effect provides an efficient tool for spectroscopy of extremely slow spin - flip relaxation in quantum dots .",
    "mechanical transportation of a spin - polarized dot in a magnetic shuttle device provides new opportunities for studying spin - flip relaxation in quantum dots .",
    "the reason can be traced to a spin - blockade of the mechanically aided shuttle current that occurs in devices with highly polarized and colinearly magnetized leads . as was shown in ref .   the above effect results in giant peaks in the shot - noise spectral function , wherein the peak heights are only limited by the rates of electronic spin flips .",
    "this enables a nanomechanical spectroscopy of rare spin - flip events , allowing spin - flip relaxation times as long as @xmath100s to be detected .",

    "a theory of the quantum coherent dynamics of mechanical vibrations , electron charge and spin was formulated and the possibility to trigger a shuttle instability by a relatively weak magnetic field was demonstrated .",
    "it was shown that the strength of the magnetic field required to control nanomechanical vibrations decreases with an increasing tunnel resistance of the device and can be as low as 10 oe for giga - ohm tunnel structures .",
    "a new type of nanoelectromechanical self excitation caused entirely by the spin splitting of electronic energy levels in an external magnetic field was predicted in ref .",
    "for a suspended nanowire , where mechanical motion in a magnetic field induces an electromotive coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "it was shown that a strong correlation between the occupancy of the spin - split electronic energy levels in the nanowire and the velocity of flexural nanowire vibrations provides energy supply from the source of dc current , flowing through the wire , to the mechanical vibrations thus making possible stable , self - supporting bending vibrations .",

    "show that in a realistic case the vibration amplitude of a suspended carbon nanotube ( cnt ) of the order of 10  nm can be achieved if magnetic field of 10  t is applied .",
    "new phenomena , qualitatively different from the electromechanics of nonmagnetic shuttle systems , may appear in magnetic shuttle devices in a situation when short - range magnetic exchange forces become comparable in strength to the long - range electrostatic forces between the charged elements of the device @xcite .",
    "there is convincing evidence that the exchange field can be several tesla at a distance of a few nanometers from the surface of a ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "because of the exponential decay of the field this means that the force experienced by a single - electron spin in the vicinity of magnetic electrodes can be very large .",
    "these spin - dependent exchange forces can lead to various  spintro - mechanical \" phenomena .",

    "if the electric charge on the dot changes its sign , the spin - dependent exchange force is insensitive to the electric charge but it changes direction if the electronic spin projection changes its sign .",
    "a very important difference between the two forces is that the electrostatic force changes only as a result of injection of additional electrons into ( out of ) the dot while the spintronic force can be changed due to the electron spin dynamics even for a fixed number of electrons on the dot ( as is the case if the dot and the leads are insulators ) . in this case",

    "the dot is in this case occupied by a spin - up electron emanating from the source electrode .",
    "this spin is a constant of motion and hence no electrical current through the device is possible since only spin - down states are available in the drain electrode . during the oscillatory motion of the dot",
    "the exchange force is therefore always directed towards the source electrode while its magnitude only depends on the position of the dot , @xmath214 . as a result",
    ", no net work is done by the exchange force on the dot .",
    "this is because contributions are positive or negative depending on the direction of the dot s motion and cancel when summed over one oscillation period .",
    "a finite amount of work can only be done if the exchange force deviates from @xmath215 as a result of spin flip processes induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "such a deviation can be viewed as an additional random force @xmath216 that acts in the opposite direction to @xmath215 . in the limit of large tunneling rate , @xmath217 , and small vibration amplitude",
    "a spin flip occurs with a probability @xmath218 during one oscillation period and is instantly accompanied by the tunneling of the dot electron into the drain electrode , thereby triggering the force @xmath216 .",
    "the duration of this force is determined by the time @xmath219 it takes for the spin of the dot to be  restored \" by another electron tunneling from the source electrode .",
    "the spin - flip induced random force @xmath220 is always directed towards the drain electrode .",
    "hence , its effect depends on the dot s direction of motion : as the dot moves away from the source electrode it will be accelerated , while as it moves towards the source it will be decelerated . since a spin - flip may occur at any point on the trajectory one needs to average over different spin - flip positions in order to calculate the net work done on the dot .",
    "the result , which depends on the competition between the effect of spin flips that occur at the same position but with the dot moving in opposite directions , is nonzero because @xmath221 is different in the two cases .",
    "as the dot moves away from the source electrode the tunneling rate to this electrode will decrease while as the dot moves towards the source it will increase .",
    "this means that the duration of spin - flip induced acceleration will prevail over the one for deceleration . as a result , in weak magnetic fields , the dot will accelerate with time and one",
    "can expect a spintro - mechanical shuttle instability in this limit .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different in the opposite limit of strong magnetic fields , where @xmath222 and the spin rotation frequency therefore greatly exceeds the tunneling rates . in this case",
    "the quick precession of the electron spin in the dot averages the exchange force to zero if one neglects the small effects of electron tunneling to and from the dot .",
    "if one takes corrections due to tunnelling into account ( having in mind that the source electrode only supplies spin - up electrons ) one comes to the conclusion that the average spin on the dot will be directed upwards .",
    "this results in a net spintro - mechanical force in the direction opposite to that of the net force occurring in a weak magnetic field limit . as a result ,",
    "in strong magnetic fields one expects on the average a deceleration of the dot .",
    "therefore , there will be no shuttle instability for such magnetic fields .    as we have discussed above spin - flip assisted electron tunnelling from source to dot to drain in our device results in a magnetic exchange force that attracts the dot to the source electrode .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is contrary to the effect of the coulomb force in the same device . indeed , since the coulomb force depends on the electric charge of the dot it repels the dot from the source electrode .",
    "hence , while the dot is empty as the result of a spin - flip assisted tunneling event from dot to drain , an  extra \" _ attractive _ coulomb force @xmath223 is active .",
    "an analysis fully analogous with our previous analysis of the ",
    "extra \" _ repulsive _ magnetic exchange force @xmath216 leads to the conclusion that the effect of the coulomb force will be just the opposite to that of the exchange force .",
    "this means that in the coulomb blockade regime in the limit of weak magnetic field there is no shuttle instability , while in strong magnetic fields electron shuttling occurs .",
    "as was shown the detailed analysis confirms these predictions .",
    "the mechanical force caused by the exchange interaction represents only one effect of the coupling of magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom in magnetic nanoelectromechanical device .",

    "the main effect , which will be in the focus of our attention , is the exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic shuttle ( dot ) and the magnetic leads .",
    "this interaction decays exponentially when the dot moves away from a lead and hence it is only important when the dot is close to one of the leads . during the periodic back - and - forth motion of the dot this happens during short time intervals near the turning points of the mechanical motion .",
    "an exchange interaction between the magnetizations of the dot and a lead results in a rotation of these two magnetization vectors in such a way that the vector sum is conserved .",
    "this is why the result of this rotation can be viewed as a transfer of some magnetization @xmath228 from one ferromagnet to the other . as a result the magnetization of the dot experiences some rotation around a certain axis .",
    "the total angle @xmath229 of the rotation accumulated during the time when the dot is magnetically coupled to the lead is an essential parameter which depends on the mechanical and magnetic characteristics of the device .",
    "the continuation of the mechanical motion breaks the magnetic coupling of the dot with the first lead but later , as the dot approaches the other magnetic lead an exchange coupling is established with this second lead with the result that magnetization which is  loaded `` on the dot from the first lead is ' ' transferred \" to the this second lead .",
    "this is how the transfer of magnetization from one magnetic lead to another is induced mechanically .",
    "the transfer creates an effective coupling between the magnetizations of the two leads .",
