    "the @xmath5 structure of the weak interaction was established in the study of nuclear @xmath6 decays for the quarks and lepton in the first generation @xcite . since then , several charged current interactions in the second and third generations have been investigated and turned out to be described by similar @xmath5 interactions with a reasonable level of accuracy .    among the charged current processes observed so far , pure- and semi- tauonic @xmath0 meson decays , @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite",
    "are thought - provoking in the sense that they contain both the quark ( @xmath8 ) and the lepton ( @xmath9 ) in the third generation .",
    "their large masses suggest a close connection with the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , which is still not fully understood even after the discovery of a di - gamma resonance @xcite .",
    "the ewsb sector in a candidate of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) often has a different structure from that of the sm .",
    "a typical example is the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) of type ii @xcite , which has the higgs sector identical to that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite at the tree level .",
    "a pair of charged higgs bosons appears in this class of models , and its couplings to fermions are proportional to the involved fermion masses and further enhanced if the ratio of vacuum expectation values , @xmath10 , is large .",
    "several authors have studied effects of these enhanced couplings , which modify the @xmath5 structure , in the pure- and semi- tauonic @xmath0 decays@xcite .    from the experimental point of view , these @xmath0 decay processes are rather difficult to identify because of two or more missing neutrinos in the final states . with the help of large statistics and low backgrounds , however , they are good targets of @xmath11 @xmath0 factory experiments .",
    "the observed branching fraction of @xmath7 is @xmath12 and that of @xmath1 is @xmath13 .",
    "comparing the pure- and semi- tauonic @xmath0 decays , the latter provides a wide variety of observables besides the larger branching fraction , such as decay distributions @xcite and polarizations @xcite .",
    "hence , the semi - tauonic processes allow us to investigate the structure of the relevant charged current interaction , and we concentrate on @xmath1 in this work .",
    "another advantage of @xmath1 is that theoretical and experimental uncertainties tend to be reduced by taking the ratio of branching fraction to the semileptonic decays , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "these decay modes including lighter charged leptons are supposed to be less sensitive to the ewsb sector and assumed to be described by the sm in the present work .",
    "the ratios of the branching fractions are defined by @xmath18 and their experimental values are summarized as @xmath19 where we combine the results of babar @xcite and belle @xcite assuming the gaussian distribution .",
    "these measurements seem to be larger than the sm predictions , @xmath20 and the sm is disfavored at @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) is made consistent with the corresponding experimental value in the 2hdm of type ii by adjusting @xmath24 , but it is unlikely to make both of them agree with the experimental results .",
    "thus , the 2hdm of type ii is also disfavored .    in the present work ,",
