    "thermoelectricity has been known since the observation of seebeck effect in 1821 which revealed the interplay between thermal gradient and electric potential , opening a way for power generation and refrigeration@xcite .",
    "recently , spin caloritronics , a new field combining thermoelectronics with spintronics that describes heat and spin transport , has attracted increasing attention@xcite .",
    "the spin seebeck effect referring to the generation of spin voltage as a result of a temperature gradient has been observed experimentally in both ferromagnetic metals and magnetic insulators@xcite .",
    "spin voltage , the potential between different spins , leads to a pure spin current which can be measured by the inverse spin hall effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the discovery of graphene@xcite , a two - dimensional atomically thin sheet of carbon atoms , opens a new path for the next generation green electronics@xcite .",
    "zigzag graphene nanoribbons ( zgnrs ) , one - dimensional narrow stripes of graphene showing metallic characteristics , are particularly interesting for its potential applications in spintronics and thermoelectronics due to its unique electric properties and high thermal conductivity@xcite .",
    "the spin seebeck effect has been proposed in zgnr based materials from the first - principles calculation , which shows controllable thermal induced spin - polarized currents for graphene - based spin caloritronics@xcite .    apart from the spin degree of freedom , graphene can also be characterized by its valley index , namely , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 dirac point in the brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "according to the time reversal symmetry , the electron carrying one valley index shows the different direction of propagation from that of another valley@xcite .",
    "it is found that the intervalley coupling in suspended graphene is very weak@xcite .",
    "therefore , being a good quantum number , the valley degree of freedom can be used in valleytronics for the application of information processing similar to spin used in spintronics@xcite .",
    "a valley filter was firstly proposed in zgnr based ballistic point contact in which the occupation of a single valley was achieved and such a valley polarization could be inverted by a local gate voltage@xcite . by introducing the line defect in graphene , a controllable 100% valley polarization has been reported and widely studied theoretically@xcite .",
    "moreover , the generation of a pure bulk valley current without net charge current through quantum pumping induced by mechanical vibrations has been demonstrated in graphene by using the well - known dirac hamiltonian@xcite .    in this paper , we explore the valley degree of freedom in the seebeck effect of zgnrs , namely , how to generate a valley current by temperature gradient . similar to the spin seebeck effect , we call it valley seebeck effect . a novel way of generating pure valley current is further proposed by applying both temperature gradient and bias voltage .",
    "we find that the pure valley current is linear with the thermal gradient in a broad temperature range while it increases significantly with the increasing temperature of leads under a same thermal gradient .",
    "we also present a gate tunable field effect transistor ( fet ) for the pure valley current driven by the temperature gradient , revealing a new perspective for valley caloritronics device applications .",
    "the previous theoretical work shows that the lowest propagating mode for zgnrs has a fixed valley index while for armchair nanoribbon each propagating channel is contributed by the mixed state of both valleys . as a result ,",
    "the valley index or valley current for armchair nanoribbon is not well defined @xcite .",
    "therefore , zgnrs are chosen to study the valley effect . in order to control the valley",
    "current , two different gate regions are introduced into zgnrs . the first gate with a constant voltage is applied in region and the second gate with tunable gate voltage is applied in region as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . in the tight - binding approximation",

    "the length of each gate region is set to be 25.8  nm",

    "we define the valley current as , @xmath25 from the band structure of zgnrs , it can be found that the momentum and valley index of electron in the first subband are locked together so that the left - moving electron has valley index @xmath1 while electron with valley index @xmath2 moves to the right as shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "such a unique electronic property of zgnrs is independent of the ribbon width .",
    "because at a given energy the sign of @xmath26 determines the direction of electron flow and hence valley index , we can express the valley current of zgnrs as , @xmath27 which will be used in the calculation of valley current . to make the comparison with electric current , in the following calculation",

    "it is well known that there is a conductance plateau of 1g@xmath30 around the fermi level for pristine zgnrs which is symmetrical about the fermi level , i.e. , @xmath31 with respect to the fermi level .",
    "we also know that the difference of the fermi - dirac functions @xmath32 is an odd function of energy measured at the fermi level . as a consequence , there is no electric current due to the temperature gradient since the contribution of current below and above the fermi level exactly cancel each other in eq.([cur ] ) , while a pure valley current can be generated from the definition of eq .",
    "( [ cur1 ] ) .",
    "this is the simplest but trivial way to achieve the valley seebeck effect .    in order to achieve the valley seebeck effect that can be efficiently controlled , one has to break the symmetry of @xmath31 . we first apply a static gate voltage in region i with @xmath28  v so that the system becomes a double barrier tunneling structure .",
    "the transmission spectrum of the system is plotted in fig .",

    "only several resonant peaks exist above the fermi level .",

    "the thermal induced electric current is caused by a temperature gradient ( @xmath34 ) between the left electrode ( @xmath36 ) and right electrode ( @xmath38 ) without the external bias voltage .",
    "we first set the temperature of the right lead to be zero .",
    "we find that the electric current depends linearly on the temperature gradient and the differential thermoelectric conductance @xmath39 is 5.6  na / k .",
    "the dependent of valley current on the temperature gradient is also linear with a slightly larger slope .",
    "the valley current at @xmath40  k is only 10  na higher than the electric current at the same temperature difference and the @xmath41 ratio is 5.7  na / k .",
    "to further study the valley seebeck effect in the linear regime , namely , @xmath42 , we calculate the electric and valley current at different temperature gradients by fixing @xmath43  k while keeping @xmath44 to generate the positive electric current , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . both the electric and valley current show linear dependence on the temperature gradient with the same differential thermoelectric conductance as those of @xmath45  k , namely , 5.6  na / k and 5.7  na / k , respectively .",

    "[ fig2](b ) shows the current as a function of the temperature of left lead with @xmath37  k as an example .",
    "we find that the electric current first increases quickly with the increasing temperature and reaches a maximum about 112.2  na at @xmath46  k. it then decreases slightly due to the contribution of the transmission peak at 0.05 ev and the electric current reduces to 111.9  na at @xmath43  k. the valley current is higher than the electric current for all temperatures of left lead with the same fixed temperature gradient since all transmission coefficients contribute positively on it and it enhances significantly with the increasing temperature of left lead .",
    "the valley current is about 111.1  na at @xmath47  k and raises to 114.5  na when the temperature of left lead increases to 200  k.     with fixed @xmath33  k. inset : valley current ( black solid line ) and the corresponding external bias ( blue dotted line ) as a function of @xmath34 with fixed @xmath35  k.

    "[ fig3](a ) presents the pure valley current and the applied bias as a function of temperature gradient with @xmath45 k. an external bias is applied to make electric current vanish while the valley current is nonzero .",
    "obviously , this bias depends on the temperature gradient linearly .",
    "we find that the bias increases from 3  mv at @xmath48  k to 12.1  mv at @xmath40  k with a @xmath49 ratio of 61  @xmath0v / k .",
    "in contrast to the vanished electric current , the valley current is enhanced slightly compared with the case without external bias as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) with a @xmath50 ratio of 6.6 na / k .",
    "it is 1316  na under the temperature gradient of 200  k , which is 186  na higher than that with no external bias .",
    "the pure valley current and the corresponding external bias at different temperature gradients with @xmath43  k are also plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "both valley current and applied bias exhibit nearly linear characteristics with the @xmath50 and @xmath49 ratio of 4.1 na / k and 107  @xmath0v / k , respectively .",
    "we find that the pure valley current is a little bit smaller than the valley current without external bias as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) at the same temperature gradient .",
    "for instance , at @xmath37  k , the pure valley current is 77  na with an external bias of 2.28  mv while the valley current without bias is 114  na .    for a fixed temperature gradient of 20  k , the pure valley current and the corresponding applied bias as a function of the temperature of left lead",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . we find that the valley current shows significant increase from 56.8  na at @xmath47  k to 70.9  na at @xmath43  k , while the corresponding external bias reduces from 2.82  mv to 2.45  mv because the contribution of the transmission coefficients above the fermi level on the current becomes smaller at higher temperatures of both leads with the same temperature gradient .",

( b ) valley current as a function of @xmath9 under several temperature gradients with fixed @xmath35  k. , title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    in order to control the pure valley current , we then introduce another gate voltage in region described in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , namely , various values of @xmath9 is used in the hamiltonian as defined in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) .",
    "this setup is a prototype of valley fet .",
    "the pure valley current as a function of gate voltage @xmath9 under several temperature gradients with @xmath45  k is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "we find that under a negative gate voltage such as -0.05  v , the transmission plateau below the fermi level shifts by 0.05  ev to the lower energy compared with that for the case of @xmath29 while the resonant transmission peaks above the fermi level shift to the higher energy as shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig4](a ) . therefore , there is a transmission gap of 0.06  ev around the fermi level leading to a very small valley current under a gate voltage of -0.05  v. when we increase the gate voltage , the transmission plateau moves towards the fermi level which reduces the transmission gap , resulting in a significant increase of valley current . the threshold gate voltage and on valley current of the system are proportional to the temperature gradient and the valley current increases to a maximal value at the neutral gate voltage , which shows the potential application as a valley fet driven by the temperature gradient .",
    "the valley transconductances @xmath52 of such a prototypical thermoelectrical valley fet are 27  @xmath0s for @xmath53  k and around 30  @xmath0s for the cases of @xmath54 and 100  k , which are almost twice the transconductance of typical silicon - based transistors@xcite .",
    "upon further applying a positive gate voltage , the transmission plateau remains below the fermi level rather than shifting to the higher energy .",
    "therefore , the valley current is almost unchanged in the gate region of [ 0.0 , 0.1 ] v , which leads to a stable operating valley current for the proposed zgnr based thermoelectrical valley fet .",
    "moreover , this stable valley current of zgnrs under the positive gate voltage is also proportional to the temperature gradient .",
    "we also calculate the pure valley current as a function of gate voltage @xmath9 at different temperature gradients with @xmath43  k. similar to the case of @xmath45  k , the valley current increases with the increasing gate voltage and remains at the maximum value when the gate voltage becomes positive .",
    "it is found that the on valley current of such a thermoelectrical valley fet is only about 70% of that of the system with @xmath45  k at the same temperature gradient , resulting in a smaller transconductance which is 7.5  @xmath0s for the case of @xmath5560  k.    it is worth mentioning that the pure valley current studied in this paper may be detected experimentally from nonlocal multi - terminal measurements at room temperature@xcite .",
    "the physical origin of pure valley current is due to the momentum - valley locking in the first subband of zgnrs .",
    "this property should be robust against a weak edge roughness since numerical results indicated that the dirac cone of graphene is robust against disorders @xcite .",
    "we also wish to point out that in this study we have neglected the temperature redistribution according to the joule heating originated from the external bias in our simulation which will affect the pure valley current in reality .",
    "moreover , for other two - dimensional materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdc ) , the band structures of their nanoribbons are much more complicated and the phenomenon of momentum - valley locking no longer exists in tmdc .",
    "hence our proposed theoretical method is not applicable to tmdc in the present stage .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate the valley seebeck effect in a gate tunable zgnr based device by calculating valley current due to the temperature gradient across the device . for the first subband transport in zgnrs , the pure valley current shows linear @xmath56 characteristics with the thermal gradient in a broad temperature range while it increases significantly with the increasing temperatures of the lead for a fixed temperature gradient .",
    "a thermoelectrical valley fet is then proposed . by tuning the gate voltage in the central region of zgnrs ,",
    "the valley fet can switch on and off with the valley transconductance up to 30  @xmath0s .",
    "it also shows a stable operating valley current under the positive gate voltage .",
    "our theoretical work can be useful for the potential application of valley caloritronics .",
