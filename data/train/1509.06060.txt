    "the higgs boson was discovered at lhc in 2012  @xcite , and its mass and coupling constants turned out to be consistent with the predictions in the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "however , although the higgs boson was found , the structure of the higgs sector remains unknown .",
    "there are possibilities of non - minimal higgs sectors which contain additional higgs bosons .",
    "they also can satisfy the current data .",
    "in fact , in large number of new physics scenarios , extended higgs sectors are predicted .",
    "the structure of the higgs sector is strongly connected to these new physics scenarios .",
    "therefore , the higgs sector is a probe of new physics .",
    "although parameters of an extended higgs sector are basically free , they can be constrained by imposing some compelling theoretical conditions , such as those of perturbative unitarity , vacuum stability and triviality .",
    "the requirement of perturbative unitarity  @xcite is known to give a conservative bound on the parameters of a model , beyond which the perturbation calculation does not work .",
    "it goes without saying that the parameters can also be constrained by taking into account various experimental results such as electroweak precision data  @xcite , observables in flavour physics  @xcite , the higgs boson signal strength  @xcite and so on . by the combination of the bounds from the theoretical consistency and those from the experimental data , a parameter space in extended higgs sectors",
    "can be further restricted .",
    "the theoretical constraints have been intensively studied in the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) .",
    "nice reviews for the thdms have been presented in refs .",
    "previously , the unitarity bound was mainly studied for the model with a ( softly - broken ) discrete @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite with cp - conservation  @xcite .",
    "the softly - broken discrete @xmath0 symmetry is phenomenologically important in order to avoid flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , under which there are four types of yukawa interactions  @xcite .",
    "bounds from vacuum stability and triviality have also been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and in refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively , in @xmath0 symmetric thdms .",
    "these theoretical bounds have been used to limit magnitudes of cross sections and decay rates of tree level processes  @xcite , radiative corrections due to additional higgs bosons to the higgs couplings  @xcite and one - loop induced processes  @xcite .",
    "however , analyses in the most general thdm without the @xmath0 symmetry is getting important as an effective description of more various new physics scenarios , such as supersymmetric sms with non - holomorphic yukawa couplings  @xcite and also general models with cp - violation  @xcite which is required for successful scenario of electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .    in this letter , we investigate unitarity bounds in the most general thdm without the @xmath0 symmetry nor cp - conservation .",
    "we calculate s - wave amplitudes for two - body elastic scatterings of nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons and physical scalar bosons at high energies for all possible initial and final states ( 14 neutral  @xcite , 8 singly - charged  @xcite and 3 doubly - charged states ) . by choosing appropriate bases of the scattering states which are deduced using the conserved quantum numbers at high energies such as the hypercharge , weak isospin and the third component of the latter  @xcite",
    ", the scattering matrix is given as a block - diagonalized form with at most @xmath1 submatrices .",
    "thus , all of the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix can be easily evaluated numerically . the analytic result for the block diagonalized",
    "s - wave matrix is consistent with that given in ref .  @xcite . by requiring that each of the eigenvalues is not too large to break validity of perturbation calculation ,",
    "the model parameters , e.g. , the masses of extra higgs bosons and mixing angles , can be constrained .",
    "our results can be useful to constrain parameter spaces whenever one evaluates physics quantities in the most general thdm .",
    "we then numerically demonstrate that the bound on the mass @xmath2 of the second lightest higgs boson , whatever it is , is obtained by inputting the mass of the discovered higgs boson @xmath3 under the assumption of non - zero deviations in the higgs boson coupling @xmath4 with the weak boson @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the sm value .",
    "currently , the @xmath4 coupling was measured with @xmath7 accuracy by the lhc run - i experiment ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and that is expected to be measured more accurately at future collider experiments . if a deviation is detected in the @xmath4 coupling , we can obtain the constraint on the region of @xmath2 even without its direct discovery .",

    "furthermore , only the scalar boson contact interactions contribute to the s - wave amplitude .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the s - wave amplitude matrix is quite simply done just by extracting the coefficient of the scalar boson quartic terms .",
    "there are 14 neutral , 8 singly - charged and 3 doubly - charged 2 body scalar boson channels .",

    "finally , three ( positive ) doubly - charged channels are expressed as : @xmath136 we note that the negative charged states are obtained by taking charge conjugation for each positive charged channel , which give the same set of eigenvalues of the matrix for the corresponding positive charged channels .",
    "when we impose symmetries in the potential , we obtain the block - diagonalized s - wave amplitude matrix with a smaller size of submatrices .",
    "for example , if we assume the cp - invariance ( for the case of @xmath137 ) , the maximal size of the submatrices reduces into @xmath50 , or if we impose the ( softly - broken ) @xmath0 symmetry ( for the case of @xmath138 ) , the maximal size of the submatrices reduces into @xmath139 as they have already known in refs .  @xcite .    in order to constrain the parameters in the potential , we impose the following condition for each eigenvalue of the s - wave amplitude matrix : @xmath140 is conventionally taken to be 1/2  @xcite or 1  @xcite , and @xmath141 with all @xmath142 being real due to the hermitian nature of the s - wave amplitude matrix .",

    "in general , the solutions of such an equation is given as a too complicated form to explicitly show in this letter .",
    "therefore , we do not show the explicit formula , and we numerically calculate the eigenvalues in the numerical study given in the next section .",
    "we here discuss the constraint on the parameter space using the unitarity bound .",

    "( [ lam1])-([m12 ] ) , this constraint can be translated into the bound on physical parameters such as the masses of higgs bosons and mixing angles .",
    "it is worthful to mention here that we can obtain an upper limit on the masses of extra higgs bosons even when the sm - like higgs boson @xmath145 coupling with the gauge bosons ( @xmath4 , @xmath146 ) slightly deviates from the sm prediction .",
    "this can be intuitively understood as follows .",
    "first , in the higgs basis defined in eq .",
    "( [ higgs - basis ] ) , the kinetic terms for the higgs fields are given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the higgs - gauge - gauge type vertex , i.e. , @xmath149 , only comes from the first term of eq .",
    "( [ lkin ] ) at the tree level . in the mass eigenbasis ,",
    "the ratio of the @xmath4 coupling @xmath150 in the thdm to that of sm is then expressed by using the rotation matrix @xmath55 given in eq .",
    "( [ neut ] ) as @xmath151 we note that @xmath152 corresponds to @xmath153 in the cp - conserving case as it is seen in eq .",
    "( [ sinba ] ) .",
    "thus , the non - zero deviation in the @xmath4 couplings from the sm prediction comes from the mixing effect of neutral higgs bosons , i.e. , @xmath154 .",
    "second , when there is no mixing among the neutral higgs bosons , the mass of @xmath3 and those of the extra higgs bosons @xmath63 and @xmath64 are schematically expressed as @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively , as it is seen in eqs .",
    "( [ m11sq ] ) , ( [ m22sq ] ) and ( [ m33sq ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the no mixing case , the upper bound on the masses of extra higgs bosons can not be obtained , because they can be taken to be as large as possible by using the @xmath70 dependence . in other words",
    ", we can take the decoupling limit  @xcite of the extra higgs bosons by taking @xmath157 .",
    "on the other hand , if there is non - zero mixing among the neutral higgs bosons , i.e. , @xmath158 , @xmath70 dependence appears in @xmath159 which must be kept to be about ( 125 gev)@xmath160 .",
    "therefore , we can not take a too large value of @xmath70 in that case , because we need a large cancellation of the @xmath70 contribution to @xmath159 by the @xmath155 term which must be excluded by the unitarity bound .",
    "therefore , we can obtain an upper limit on the masses of extra higgs bosons as long as the @xmath4 coupling is deviated from the sm prediction .     from the unitarity bound in the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetric case .",
