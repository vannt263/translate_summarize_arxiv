    "recently there has been a renewed interest in understanding the properties of constrained quantum dynamics @xcite . the key idea behind quantum constraints is the fact that the space of pure states ( rays through the origin of hilbert space ) is a symplectic manifold , and hence that dirac s theory of constraints @xcite in classical mechanics is applicable in the quantum regime .",
    "the quantum state space is also equipped with a metric structure  generally absent in a classical phase space  induced by the probabilistic features of quantum mechanics . in the context of analysing constrained quantum motions it is therefore natural to examine the theory from the viewpoint of metric geometry , as opposed to a treatment based entirely on symplectic geometry .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .    the metric approach that we propose is not merely a reformulation of the dirac formalism using the quantum symplectic structure .",
    "indeed , there are two distinct advantages in the metric approach over the symplectic approach : ( a ) the metric approach to quantum constraints is in general more straightforward to implement , even in situations when the constraints can be treated by the symplectic method ; and ( b ) there are nontrivial examples of constraints that can not be implemented in the symplectic approach but can be implemented in the metric approach .",
    "our plan therefore is first to outline the general metric approach to quantum constraints , and then to consider specific examples .",
    "we also derive and examine a necessary condition for the metric approach to be equivalent to the symplectic formalism .",
    "the first example examined here concerns the system consisting of a pair of spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "we impose the constraint that the state should lie on the product subspace of the total state space , upon which all the energy eigenstates lie .",
    "this is the example considered in @xcite using the symplectic approach .",
    "here we analyse the problem using the metric approach , and show that the constrained equations of motion reduce to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "the second example concerns a single spin-@xmath0 particle , and we impose the constraint that an observable that does not commute with the hamiltonian must be conserved .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest example of a quantum constraint that is not evidently tractable in the symplectic approach but can be readily dealt with by use of the metric approach .",
    "we begin by remarking that the space of pure quantum states associated with a hilbert space of dimension @xmath1 is the projective hilbert space @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "we regard @xmath2 as a real even - dimensional manifold @xmath4 , and denote a typical point in @xmath4 , corresponding to a ray in the associated hilbert space , by @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath4 has an integrable complex structure .",
    "since the complex structure of @xmath4 plays an important role in what follows , it may be helpful if we make a few general remarks about the relevant ideas .",
    "we recall that an even - dimensional real manifold @xmath6 is said to have an almost complex structure if there exists a global tensor field @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 the almost complex structure is then said to be integrable if the nijenhuis tensor @xmath9 } - j^d_{[a } \\nabla_{|d| } j^c_{b]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] vanishes @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath10 is independent of the choice of symmetric connection @xmath11 on @xmath6 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath10 can be interpreted as follows . a complex vector field on @xmath6",
    "is said to be of positive ( _ resp_. , negative ) type if @xmath12 ( _ resp_. , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath10 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the commutator of two vector fields of the same type to be of that type .    a riemannian metric @xmath14 on @xmath6 is said to be compatible with an almost complex structure @xmath7",
    "if the following conditions hold : ( i ) the metric is hermitian : @xmath15 and ( ii ) the almost complex structure is covariantly constant : @xmath16 where @xmath11 is the torsion - free riemannian connection associated with @xmath14 .",
    "an alternative expression for the hermitian condition is that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 it follows that @xmath19 if and only if @xmath20 .",
    "however , if the almost complex structure is integrable , then a sufficient condition for @xmath19 is @xmath21}=0 $ ] .",
    "this follows on account of the identity @xmath22 } - { \\textstyle\\frac{3}{2 } } \\nabla_{[a}\\omega_{bc ] } + { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{4 } } \\omega_{ad } n^d_{bc}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a manifold @xmath6 with an integrable complex structure and a compatible riemannian structure is called a khler manifold .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor @xmath23 is then referred to as the ` fundamental two - form ' or khler two - form .",
    "it follows from the definition of @xmath23 along with the hermitian condition on @xmath14 that @xmath23 itself is hermitian in the sense that @xmath24 furthermore , we find the tensor @xmath25 defined by using the inverse metric to raise the indices of @xmath23 , so @xmath26 acts as an inverse to @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath27    in the case of quantum theory there is a natural riemannian structure on the manifold @xmath4 , called the fubini - study metric .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent a pair of points in @xmath4 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are representative hilbert space vectors , then the fubini - study distance between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 the khler form @xmath23 can be used to define a one - parameter family of symplectic structures on @xmath4 , given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a nonvanishing real constant . in quantum mechanics",
    "the symplectic structure defined by @xmath36 plays a special role .",
    "in particular , if we define the inverse symplectic structure by @xmath37 so that @xmath38 , and if we choose units such that @xmath39 , then we find that the schrdinger trajectories on @xmath4 are given by hamiltonian vector fields of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 thus we see that the expectation of the hamiltonian operator @xmath42 gives rise to a real function @xmath43 on @xmath4 .",
    "this function plays the role of the hamiltonian in the determination of the symplectic flow associated with the schrdinger trajectory .",
    "with these geometric tools in hand we now proceed to formulate the metric approach to quantum constraints .",
    "we assume that the system under investigation is subject to a family of @xmath44 constraints @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the condition @xmath47 for each @xmath48 defines a hypersurface in @xmath4 .",
    "the intersection of all @xmath44 such hypersurfaces then defines the constraint subspace in @xmath4 onto which the dynamics must be restricted . to enforce the constraint in the metric approach we remove from the vector field @xmath49 those components that are normal to the constraint subspace .",
    "the equations of motion then take the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the inverse quantum symplectic structure , and where @xmath52 are the lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints . in order to determine @xmath53 we consider the identity @xmath54 . using the chain rule",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath55 substitution of ( [ eom ] ) in ( [ eom2 ] ) then gives @xmath56 to simplify ( [ eqn7 ] ) we define the symmetric matrix @xmath57 if the matrix @xmath58 is nonsingular , we write @xmath59 for its inverse such that @xmath60",
    ". we can then solve ( [ eqn7 ] ) for @xmath61 to find @xmath62 substituting the expression for @xmath63 back into ( [ eom ] ) we find that the constrained equations of motion are given by @xmath64 this is the main result of the paper .",
    "we remark that in the case for which the system of constraints @xmath65 corresponds to a family of quantum observables , @xmath58 for fixed @xmath66 represents the covariance between the two observables @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the state represented by the point @xmath28 : @xmath69 it follows that if there is a single constraint for a conserved observable ( as in example  2 below ) , then @xmath70 is never singular except at isolated points of zero measure because the variance of an observable is positive except at its eigenstates . in the case of two conserved observables ,",
    "say , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 the determinant @xmath74 of @xmath58 is then given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the correlation of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "since the variances are positive ( except at eigenstates ) , @xmath74 can identically vanish if and only if @xmath79 , i.e. either @xmath77 and @xmath78 are perfectly correlated or they are perfectly anticorrelated .",
    "analogous observations can be made when there are more than two conserved observables for the constraint , and we conclude that @xmath58 is singular only when the constraints are redundant .",
    "therefore , in the case of constraints on conserved observables the metric approach introduced here is always implementable , provided that we do not introduce redundant constraints .    in the case of algebraic constraints",
    "for which the constraint system @xmath65 does not correspond to a family of quantum observables ( as in example  1 below ) , we are unaware of any physical characteristic that might lead to a singular behaviour in @xmath58 .",
    "thus in this case the invertibility of @xmath58 must be examined individually .",
    "before considering specific examples of constrained systems that can be described using the present approach , it will be of interest to ask how this framework might be related to the approach of dirac @xcite , or more precisely , its quantum counterpart @xcite which we shall refer to as the symplectic approach . in the symplectic approach , the constrained equations of motion can be expressed in the same form as ( [ xdot ] ) , but with a modified inverse symplectic structure @xmath80 in place of @xmath51 , which in effect is the induced symplectic form on the constraint surface @xcite .",
    "thus , we would like to know under what condition the metric approach leading to the right side of ( [ eq:12 ] ) also reduces to a modified symplectic flow of the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the same hamiltonian as the one in the original schrdinger equation ( [ xdot ] ) .",
    "intuitively , we would expect that when there is an even number of constraints , the two methods might become equivalent .",
    "however , the verification or falsification of this assertion turns out to be difficult .",
    "nevertheless , in what follows we shall establish the sufficient condition under which the symplectic approach and the metric approach become equivalent .    in order to investigate whether ( [ eq:12 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath83 for a suitably defined antisymmetric tensor @xmath80",
    ", we rearrange terms in ( [ eq:12 ] ) to write @xmath84 where we have defined @xmath85 it follows that we need to find whether the expression @xmath86 defines a symplectic structure on the subspace of the state space . since the symplectic structure @xmath51 is antisymmetric , we shall examine under which condition @xmath80 is antisymmetric .",
    "this is equivalent to asking whether the following relation holds : @xmath87 suppose that ( [ assump1 ] ) is valid . then using ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:77 ] ) we can rewrite ( [ assump1 ] ) as @xmath88 transvecting this with @xmath89 and relabelling the indices we obtain @xmath90 from which it follows that @xmath91 multiplying both sides of ( [ assump2 ] ) with @xmath92 we find that the condition ( [ assump1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath93 where we have used ( [ jjdelta ] ) and the symmetry of @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that for the metric formulation of the constraint motion ( [ eq:12 ] ) to be expressible in the hamiltonian form ( [ ceom2 ] ) with the original hamiltonian @xmath82 the matrix @xmath95 defined by ( [ mu ] ) must be hermitian .",
    "this is the sufficiency condition that we set out to establish .",
    "let us now examine specific cases to gain insights into this condition .",
    "_ single constraint case . _ in general the @xmath96-invariance condition ( [ cond1 ] ) need not be satisfied .",
    "one can easily see this by considering the case for which there is only one constraint given by @xmath97",
    ". then expression ( [ eq:9 ] ) becomes a scalar quantity , which we will denote by @xmath70 , and thus its inverse is @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that @xmath99 substituting this expression for @xmath94 into ( [ cond1 ] ) gives us @xmath100 which implies that @xmath101 but this clearly is a contradiction , since the two vectors @xmath102 and @xmath103 are _",
    "orthogonal_. we see therefore that in the case of a single constraint the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) is not satisfied , and the constraint motion ( [ eq:12 ] ) can not be expressed in the hamiltonian form ( [ ceom2 ] ) .",
    "_ two constraint case .",
    "_ let us examine the case in which there are two constraints .",
    "as we shall show , in this case the @xmath96-invariance condition for @xmath95 reduces to a simpler condition .",
    "let us write @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the two constraints .",
    "then the inverse of the matrix @xmath58 can be written in the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is a totally - skew tensor with @xmath109 . substituting ( [ m_ij ] ) into ( [ mu ] ) we find @xmath110 where we have defined @xmath111 in order for ( [ mu-2const ] ) to satisfy ( [ cond1 ] ) we thus require that @xmath112 where we have substituted ( [ mu-2const ] ) into condition ( [ cond1 ] ) and used @xmath113 . since @xmath114",
    "we find that ( [ cond2 ] ) can be written more explicitly in the form @xmath115 hence if this condition is satisfied ( with either a plus or a minus sign ) by the two constraints @xmath116 and @xmath117 , then the constrained equations of motion ( [ eq:12 ] ) take the form ( [ ceom2 ] ) .    _ holomorphic constraints . _",
    "if we choose the constraint function to be holomorphic so that the two constraints @xmath116 and @xmath117 are given by the real and imaginary parts of @xmath118 then we can find the form of @xmath119 for which ( [ cond2 ] ) holds . to obtain an expression for @xmath119 , we recall that a real vector on @xmath4 can be decomposed into its complex ` positive ' and ` negative ' parts @xmath120 ( cf .",
    "these components are given respectively by @xmath121 hence , @xmath122 is the complex conjugate of @xmath123 , and these components are the eigenvectors of the complex structure @xmath124 with eigenvalues @xmath125 .",
    "it follows that if the vector is of type @xmath126 then @xmath127 , and similarly if @xmath128 then @xmath129 . with respect to this decomposition",
    "the tensor @xmath119 can be expressed as @xmath130 we rewrite the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) in the form @xmath131 by contracting both sides with @xmath132 and using ( [ jjdelta ] ) . in terms of the decomposition ( [ tau - decomp ] ) we find that in order for ( [ cond3 ] ) to be true we require that @xmath119 takes either of the two forms : @xmath133 where the plus and minus in @xmath134 correspond to the required sign in ( [ cond3 ] ) . in view of ( [ phiab ] ) we can write the two constraints as @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath138",
    ". then we have : @xmath139 using these expressions together with ( [ eqn32 ] ) we find that the components of @xmath140 all vanish .",
    "hence , when the two constraints @xmath116 and @xmath117 are given by ( [ phiab ] ) , the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is satisfied when @xmath119 takes the form @xmath141 i.e. when @xmath142 .",
    "it follows that the metric formalism associated with holomorphic constraints of the form ( [ phiab ] ) is equivalent to the symplectic formalism .",
    "we remark that the quadratic form @xmath80 acting from the right annihilates the vector @xmath143 normal to the constraint surface .",
    "this can be verified explicitly as follows : @xmath144 since @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "this condition , of course , is equivalent to the condition that @xmath147 .",
    "however , in general we have @xmath148 since @xmath80 is not in general antisymmetric . in other words ,",
    "the vanishing of the left side of ( [ eq : xx30 ] ) is equivalent to the @xmath96-invariance condition for @xmath95 .    in summary ,",
    "the procedure for deriving the equations of motion in the metric approach to constrained quantum motion is as follows .",
    "first , express the relevant constraints in the form @xmath149 . determine the matrix @xmath58 via ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath58 is nonsingular , calculate its inverse @xmath59 .",
    "substitute the result in ( [ eq:12 ] ) , and we recover the relevant equations of motion . having obtained the general procedure , let us now examine some explicit examples implementing this procedure .",
    "_ example 1_. the first example that we consider here is identical to the one considered in @xcite involving a pair of spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "we consider the subspace of the state space associated with product states upon which all the energy eigenstates lie .",
    "an initial state that lies on this product space is required to remain a product state under the evolution generated by a generic hamiltonian . in this example",
    "there are two constraints @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and we shall show that the metric approach introduced here gives rise to a result that agrees with the one obtained in @xcite using the symplectic approach .",
    "let us work with the coordinates of the quantum state space given by the ` action - angle ' variables @xcite , where the canonical conjugate variables are given by @xmath152 such that when a generic pure states @xmath153 is expanded in terms of the energy eigenstates @xmath154 , the associated amplitudes are given by @xmath155 , and the relative phases by @xmath156 . in the case of a pair of spin-@xmath157 particles",
    "we can thus expand a generic state in the form @xmath158 this choice of coordinates has the property that if we write @xmath159 for the hamiltonian , where @xmath160 , then the schrdinger equation is expressed in the form of the conventional hamilton equations : @xmath161 in the energy basis the hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath162 it follows that the phase space function @xmath163 for a generic hamiltonian is given by @xmath164 where @xmath165 .",
    "the symplectic structure and its inverse in these coordinate are thus given respectively by @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the @xmath168 identity matrix and @xmath169 is the @xmath168 null matrix .",
    "let us write @xmath170 for the coefficients of the energy eigenstates in ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "then the constraint equation is expressed in the form @xmath171 , which is just a single complex equation @xcite .",
    "thus in real terms we have two constraints given by @xmath172 these constraints are ` separable ' and can be rewritten as @xmath173    the next step in the metric approach for the constraint is to work out the expression for the fubini - study metric associated with the line element : @xmath174 } \\bar{\\psi}_{[\\alpha}{\\mbox{$\\rm d$}}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\beta]}}{(\\bar{\\psi}_{\\gamma } \\psi^{\\gamma})^2 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the canonical variables @xmath175 .",
    "a calculation shows that @xmath176 where for simplicity we have denoted @xmath177 .",
    "the inverse is thus : @xmath178 to obtain explicit expressions for equations of motion ( [ eq:12 ] ) we need to calculate the matrix @xmath58 and its inverse .",
    "a short calculation shows that @xmath179 from which its inverse @xmath59 can easily be obtained .",
    "putting these together , we find that the equations of motion are given by @xmath180 we can simplify the equations using the relation @xmath181 , which gives us @xmath182 these equations are precisely the ones obtained in @xcite by means of the symplectic formalism .",
    "the solution to these equations are also worked out in @xcite .    before we proceed to the next example ,",
    "let us verify explicitly that the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) for the equivalence of the metric and symplectic approaches indeed holds in this example .",
    "for this we need to obtain the expression for the complex structure in the canonical coordinates @xmath183 using the relations ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:77 ] ) .",
    "this is given by @xmath184 where as before we write @xmath177 .",
    "substituting this expression and the expression for @xmath94 obtained from ( [ mu ] ) into ( [ cond1 ] ) , we find that the condition is indeed satisfied .    _",
    "example 2_. consider a single spin-@xmath157 particle system immersed in a @xmath185-field with a unit strength .",
    "the space of pure states for this system is just the surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the pauli spin matrix in the @xmath185-direction .",
    "we then impose the constraint that an observable , say @xmath188 , that does not commute with the hamiltonian , must be conserved under the time evolution .",
    "as before we chose the canonical coordinates @xmath189 for the bloch sphere by setting @xmath190 the conservation of @xmath188 then reduces to a single real constraint of the form @xmath191 , which , by use of ( [ ex2psi ] ) , gives us @xmath192     when the system evolves according to the hamiltonian @xmath193 , where @xmath188 and @xmath187 are pauli matrices . shown in yellow",

    "the great circles shown in red , the equators of the @xmath28 and @xmath185-axis , consist of fixed points .",
    "a state that initially lies on one of these great circles does not move away from that point , whereas all other states evolve asymptotically towards the fixed point where the associated integral curve intersects the equator of the sphere .",
