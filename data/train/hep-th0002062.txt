    "we use the formalism presented in @xcite . under the condition @xmath183 , which is equivalent to the presence of the nonzero mass in two dimensions , the form of propagator ( [ 2.6 ] )",
    "is admissible for this formalism .",
    "it is easy to see that for all diagrams , the index @xmath249 of the uv divergence with respect to @xmath166 and @xmath48 is negative ; therefore , for our theory , there are no special cases described in @xcite .",
    "the numerators of all integrands of the feynman diagrams are polynomials ; therefore , we have @xmath250 and @xmath251 ( for the notation , see  @xcite ) . the basic formula is @xmath252 where the minimum is taken over all subdiagrams , and the required difference between the light - front and lorentz - invariant calculations is of the order @xmath253 .",
    "an external gluon line carrying the label `` @xmath254 '' contributes @xmath255 to the value of @xmath256 .",
    "a pair of external fermion lines that are connected with the continuous fermion line contributes @xmath257 ( if the diagram is proportional to @xmath258 with respect to the labels of this pair ) or @xmath255 ( if it , is proportional to @xmath259 ) or @xmath18 ( in the other cases ) to the value of @xmath256 .",
    "we can see from formula ( [ 2.6 ] ) that without considering the factors from the vertices , the summary gluon propagator of the @xmath260-line contributes @xmath261 ( if the propagator carries the labels `` @xmath262 '' ) or @xmath263 ( if the propagator carries the labels `` @xmath264 '' or `` @xmath265 '' ) to the value of @xmath77 .",
    "the factors from the vertices carrying the index `` @xmath254 '' contribute @xmath255 to the value of @xmath77 . from formula ( [ 2.5 ] ) with conditions ( [ v.4a ] ) taken into account , we see that the summary fermion propagator of the @xmath260-line contributes @xmath261 to the value of @xmath77 .",
    "this number increases if we decrease the number of the additional pauli - villars fermion fields . analyzing this information",
    ", we obtain the general form of the diagrams with @xmath266 ( in fact , @xmath267 ) .",
    "it is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the conditions for these diagrams to be trivially dependent on external momenta are fulfilled ( see  @xcite ) ; therefore , for these diagrams , the required difference is @xmath268 where @xmath269 is a constant in the limit @xmath50 , i.e. , the dependence on external momenta is absent .",
    "there is no possible logarithmic correction @xmath270 , because , in view of the lorentz invariance in the space of @xmath166 and @xmath48 , which holds for the lagrangian , the quantity @xmath271 must behave like the `` @xmath60''-component of a vector , but there are no such expressions .",
    "there could only be the component of an external momentum , but , we already know that there is no dependence on it .",
    "therefore , all the difference is compensated by adding the term of the form @xmath272 to the lagrangian , i.e. , by redefining the coefficient @xmath184 in formula ( [ v.3 ] ) .",
    "we analyze the possibility of the occurrence of the essential ir divergences ( i.e. , those occurring at any value of the external momenta ) in the feynman diagrams in the euclidean space .",
    "we consider two cases of the divergences : when integrating over only the longitudinal momenta ( they can appear because of ( the term proportional to @xmath273 in the gluon propagator ) and when integrating over all momenta ( the factors @xmath274 in the propagators also contribute to these divergences ) .    *",
    "first case . *",
    "we study whether a divergence exists if a part ( or all ) of the longitudinal loop momenta tend to some finite values .",
    "we assume that the external momenta do not take the special values ( where the sum of a part of them is equal to zero ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that the transverse loop momenta are such that for all of the propagator momenta , we have @xmath275 ( if this condition is violated , we must take the extra contribution from @xmath276 into account ; this is the second case ) .",
    "then the divergence can arise only if for some gluon line , we have @xmath277 .",
    "the factor in the integrand producing the possible divergence has the form @xmath278 and is a pole of an order not higher than one . in the loop momentum space",
    ", we consider a point where @xmath277 for a certain set of lines .",
    "we look for the power @xmath279 of the ir divergence .",
    "every line of this set contributes @xmath257 ( if it carries the labels @xmath280 , see  ( [ b.20 ] ) ) or @xmath18 ( if it carries the labels @xmath262 or @xmath265 ) .",
    "we exclude all lines with the labels @xmath262 and @xmath265 ; then every line of the set contributes @xmath257 .",
    "the differentials @xmath281 of the loop momenta ( the integration volume elements ) give a positive contribution to @xmath279 .",
    "we must consider only those loop momenta whose change ( other momenta being fixed ) violates the condition @xmath277 for the lines of the set .",
    "the number of such loop momenta is the number of lines whose momenta can be taken arbitrarily , i.e. , the number of independent lines .",
    "the total positive contribution to @xmath279 is equal to twice this number .",
    "we then find other contributions to the ir divergence .",
    "we break all lines of the set .",
    "the diagram splits into @xmath282 connected parts ( @xmath283 ) .",
    "all momenta external with respect to the whole diagram enter one part ( the external momenta would otherwise take the special values ) .",
    "we call this part separated and the other parts nonseparated .",
    "a nonseparated part is a subdiagram ; if it has the external lorentz labels , then it must be proportional to its external line momenta carrying these labels .",
    "but the factor of proportionality can not contribute to @xmath279 , because of the lorentz invariance , the invariance with respect to multiplying @xmath284 by a complex number , and the condition @xmath285 . every external line carrying the label @xmath286 ( @xmath287 )",
    "gives the factor @xmath288 or @xmath289 ; the line carrying the label `` @xmath254 '' gives the factor @xmath290 , where @xmath286 is a linear combination of the external momenta of the subdiagram , i.e. , the momenta of the set lines .",
    "therefore , every external line carrying the label `` @xmath254 '' contributes @xmath255 to @xmath279 , and one carrying the label @xmath286 contributes zero .",
    "let @xmath291 be a summary contribution to @xmath279 obtained in such a way from the nonseparated parts .",
    "let @xmath132 be the number of lines of the set and @xmath292 be the number of lines of the set external with respect to the separated part .",
    "every line carries the label `` @xmath254 '' at one end ; therefore , we have @xmath293 the number of the independent lines in the set is equal to @xmath294 ( each of the @xmath282 parts gives the @xmath295-function , and one @xmath295-function is common to the whole diagram ) . by the definition of @xmath279 , we have @xmath296 using ( [ b.21 ] ) , we obtain @xmath297 every nonseparated part has a minimum of two external lines .",
    "this means that all parts ( separated and nonseparated ) together have a minimum of @xmath298 external lines of the set .",
    "all these lines are pairwise connected with each other .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath299 whence we obtain @xmath300 , i.e. , the divergence can not be worse than logarithmic .",
    "we find the general case producing this divergence . in this case",
    ", all the above - cited inequalities must reduce to equalities , i.e. , we have @xmath301 , and all the nonseparated parts are two - point diagrams .",
    "the general form of such a diagram is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in this diagram every chain giving essential ir divergences contains the factor @xmath302 where @xmath303 is the nearest to the separated part nonseparated one which is one - particle irreducible subdiagram and @xmath204 are the propagators of the lines entering to the @xmath303 .",
    "the divergence takes place only when the index @xmath304 in ( [ b.28 ] ) takes values @xmath94 .",
    "* second case .",
    "* we now assume that a part or all of the four - dimensional momenta lend to certain finite values .",
    "the consideration is similar .",
    "the gluon propagator now gives a pole of the second order , whereas the fermion propagator gives no poles , because of the presence of the mass .",
    "notice , that at the investigation of ir divergences one can replace all fermion lines by @xmath305 which makes impossible getting @xmath305 to the numerator . besides in this case one can replace @xmath187 by 1 and @xmath306 by @xmath307 in the propagator of gluon which excludes @xmath57 from the consideration . that is why from dimensional considerations , it follows that every nonseparated part contributes no less than four minus the number of its external lines to @xmath279 .",
    "this is also true for the divergent diagrams with the stipulation that for the two - point diagram , we must subtract the part independent of the momentum and proportional to @xmath308 together with the divergent part , i.e. , we must normalize the gluon mass to zero in every order .",
    "the latter does not violate the ward identities in the limit of removing the regularization .",
    "therefore , we now have @xmath309 whence we obtain @xmath310 i.e. , there is no divergence .",
    "in the framework of the perturbation theory constructed based on lagrangian ( [ v.1])-([v.3 ] ) , we consider an arbitrary diagram with three gluon external lines and investigate its structure with respect to the labels of the global gauge group .",
    "this structure has the form @xmath311 .",
    "the gluon propagator is proportional to @xmath312 , the three - point gluon vertex is proportional to @xmath234 , and the four - point vertex is proportional to @xmath228 or @xmath229 .",
    "in addition , there can be fermion loops .",
    "every fermion loop gives the factor @xmath313 if the number of vertices in the loop is even or @xmath314 if this number is odd ( similar to the furry theorem in quantum electrodynamics ) .",
    "we consider only the factors related to the gauge labels . from ( [ v.7 ] ) , it follows that @xmath315 we can also write @xmath316 whence it follows that @xmath317    we replace all @xmath234 in the diagram with the right - hand side of formula ( [ c.5 ] ) and then replace all resulting expressions of the form @xmath318 according to formula ( [ c.3 ] ) . as a result , only three matrices @xmath319 carrying three external labels of the diagram remain . these matrices are connected with each other by their labels of the fundamental representation ( because after formula ( [ c.3 ] ) is used , only the kronecker symbols remain ) , i.e. , @xmath311 consists of terms of the form @xmath320    after using formula ( [ c.5 ] ) , we have the factor @xmath321 , where @xmath206 is the number of three - point gluon vertices .",
    "the use of formula ( [ c.3 ] ) gives no new imaginary factors .",
    "the initial expression consists of the real quantities @xmath312 and @xmath234 and the quantities ( [ c.1a ] ) and ( [ c.1b ] ) , of which the first is real and the second is imaginary ; therefore , it is proportional to @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is the number of fermion loops with an odd number of vertices .",
    "it is easy to show that for the diagram with three gluon external lines , the quantities @xmath206 and @xmath323 have different parities .",
    "therefore , for the powers of @xmath134 to be consistent , it is necessary that the sum of the expressions of form ( [ c.6a ] ) be imaginary , whence , using ( [ c.4 ] ) , we conclude that @xmath324    we now similarly consider the structure of an arbitrary diagram with four gluon external lines .",
    "it has the form @xmath325 .",
    "the quantity @xmath325 consists of terms of the forms @xmath326 and @xmath327 ( the latter expression is explicitly real ) .",
    "it is easy to show that for the diagram with four gluon external lines , the quantities @xmath206 and @xmath323 have the same parities .",
    "therefore , the sum of the indicated expressions , which compose @xmath325 , must be real",
    ". we can represent the quantity @xmath328 ) as a sum of its symmetrized part ( explicitly real ) and expressions of the form @xmath329 . in view of the reality condition ,",
    "the latter expression must be a sum of quantities of the form @xmath228 .",
    "direct calculation shows that the symmetrized part of the quantity @xmath328 is proportional to the symmetrized part of the quantity @xmath229 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that @xmath325 consists of terms of the forms @xmath330",
    "we shall find a form of the values which are necessary to add to feynman diagrams in order to in the limit @xmath169 make them finite and coincident with its value calculated using dimensional regularization .",
    "we consider a diagram in euclidean space constructed from propagator ( [ isp6 ] ) , from the propagator @xmath178 , and from the vertices entering ( [ 2.2 ] ) with restrictions ( [ v.6 ] ) removed .",
    "the other vertices entering ( [ v.3 ] ) are involved only in reducing the subdiagrams of the preceding orders of the perturbation theory to the `` correct '' ( i.e. , calculated using dimensional regularization ) value including cancellation of divergences .    it is clear that the summary fermion propagator can be represented as @xmath331 where @xmath332 and @xmath333 are cutoff factors that properly decrease and @xmath334 .",
    "we represent the diagram as a sum such that one summand contains only one term of the numerator of every fermion propagator .",
    "each of these summands can be represented as @xmath335 where @xmath336 represents all volume elements , @xmath337 is the product of all factors @xmath332 and @xmath333 entering tlie fermion propagators and of all factors @xmath187 entering boson propagators ( [ 2.6 ] ) , @xmath286 denotes the integration momenta , and @xmath338 denotes the external momenta of the diagram .    it is evident that we can find a function @xmath339 that is polynomial in @xmath338 , is lorentz invariant , and has no nonintegrable ir singularities such that for @xmath340 and @xmath341 , a number of the first terms of their asymptotic expansions at infinity with respect to @xmath286 coincide and the difference @xmath342 is integrable ( see the refinement below ) .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath343 up to corrections of the order @xmath344 , we can neglect the factor @xmath337 in the first integral ( because the integral converges even in the absence of this factor ) .",
    "we can then assume that this integral is calculated using dimensional regularization and we can split it into two integrals ( assuming that they are both renormalized by dimensional regularization ) . as a result , we obtain the expression @xmath345 using the expansion for the function @xmath337 in the last integral in ( [ d.4 ] ) with respect to @xmath338 in the neighborhood of the origin ( this expansion is well defined for any @xmath286 ) , we can now show that the last integral in ( [ d.4 ] ) is a polynomial in @xmath338 plus corrections of the order @xmath344 .",
    "we must make the following refinement of these considerations . before subtracting the overall divergence of the diagram",
    ", we must verify that the diagram has no subdivergences with respect to a part of the integration variables .",
    "such subdivergences can be produced by subdiagrams ( which is taken into account by the renormalization in the lower orders ) or by the divergence on integrating over a part of the momentum components .",
    "for the qcd in the gauge @xmath35 , the latter is possible because of the improper decrease of the propagator in the direction @xmath346",
    ". it is known @xcite that this divergence is present if the index of the uv divergence with respect to a part of the components is nonnegative . from the structure of the propagators",
    ", we can see that in the euclidean space , the subtraction of the overall divergence can not decrease only the index @xmath347 of the uv divergence with respect to @xmath346 .",
    "this results in the necessity to preliminarily subtract , the subdivergence with respect to @xmath346 , the subdivergence being in general dependent on the projections @xmath348 of the external momenta in an arbitrary nonpolynomial way .",
    "analysis of the diagrams for the green s functions shows that we have @xmath349 for only the one - loop two - point diagrams and that @xmath350 .",
    "these diagrams have only one external momentum .",
    "therefore , they can not have a nonpolynomial dependence on @xmath351 , because of the invariance with respect to multiplying the vector @xmath220 by a complex number .",
    "one must take into account that , for the diagrams of the green s functions , the vector @xmath220 with the nonconvolute index @xmath352 can not stand in the numerator , because this gives zero on convolution with the propagators .",
    "if we consider the one - particle irreducible vertex parts , whose diagrams do not satisfy the last condition , the divergent parts can be nonpolynomial @xcite , and the number of diagrams that are divergent with respect to @xmath346 can be much larger .",
    "it seems that if the integral of the form , described at the beginning of this appendix , converges then the result of it s calculation can not depend on the vector @xmath224 ( complex conjugated to @xmath220 up to a factor ) . but",
    "this would be true only if this integral be an analitical function of the complex vector @xmath220",
    ". however the derivative of our integral with respect to complex vector @xmath220 can be nonconvergent due to the rising of infrared singularity ( of the power of the pole in @xmath353 ) .",
    "therefore the result of the calculation of the diagram , and , hence , it s divergent part can depend on @xmath220 and on @xmath224 .",
    "it is seen from the equation ( [ isp6 ] ) for the propagator that the integrands we considered are invariant with respect to a multiplication of the vector @xmath220 by a complex number ( and of the @xmath224 by complex conjugate number ) .",
    "this allows to conclude that up to corrections of the order @xmath344 the difference between the diagram described in the beginning of this appendix ( more precisely , the finite sum of such diagrams of the given order ) and its value calculated using dimensional regularization ( i.e. , the similar sum of the first integrals in ( [ d.4 ] ) ) reduces to a polynomial in the external momenta with coefficients containing factors @xmath226 ( see the definition of this value in formula ( [ isp7 ] ) )",

    "<S> , it was impossible to investigate any other states . if ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) cutoffs are introduced to make the number of degrees of freedom finite , it would be possible , in principle , to represent the physical vacuum as a vector of the fock space with the free theory vacuum . </S>",

    "<S> the reason is that second - class constraints arise in the theory and solving them , in particular , requires inverting the covariant derivative @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> but in the gauge @xmath35 , the feynman propagator has an extra term @xmath17 in the denominator , which strengthens the singularities at @xmath38 ( at least , in the perturbation theory ) .    as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> a special regularization is required , which consists in `` cutting out '' the neighborhood of @xmath38 in the momentum space one way or another and which results in breaking the lorentz invariance ( until the regularization is removed ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is unavoidable in the liglit - front hamiltonian approach . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , we can preserve the gauge invariance if , instead of `` cutting out '' the neighborhood of @xmath38 , we restrict the space - time with respect to the coordinate @xmath10 ( @xmath39 ) and impose periodic boundary conditions in @xmath10 on all fields @xcite . in this case , the spectrum of the momentum @xmath11 becomes discrete , and the `` zero modes '' of the fields @xmath40 , i.e. , the fourier modes corresponding to @xmath38 , are explicitly singled out . to preserve the gauge invariance , </S>",
    "<S> these zero modes must be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that secondary second - class constraints arise in the theory , from which we must find the above - mentioned zero modes as functions of the other modes and substitute them in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints arc so complicated that solving them proves impossible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from the very beginning , we must discard the zero modes in the lagrangian , which results in breaking the gauge invariance . </S>",

    "<S> , we meet the problem of constructing the light - front hamiltonian such that it produces a theory equivalent to the conventional lorentz - invariant one in the limit of removing the regularization . as a necessary condition </S>",

    "<S> then , in particular , we can use the technique described in @xcite to simplify the obtained hamiltonian and the subsequent nonperturbative calculations based on the schrodinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> in doing so , we see the relation to the conventional lorentz - invariant theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem of constructing the counterterms for the light - front hamiltonian , which provide the equivalence of this approach to the lorentz - invariant one , was investigated in @xcite in the framework of the perturbation theory in the coupling constant . in that paper , the authors proposed a method for comparing two perturbation series for the green s functions constructed using the light - front hamiltonian for one and the conventional lorentz - invariant approach for the other . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the uv regularization , they regularized the singularities at @xmath38 using the cutoff @xmath41 , i.e. , eliminating the fourier components with @xmath42 for every field in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> it was revealed that for the required equivalence for the nongauge field theories ( in particular , for the yukawa model ) , it was only necessary to add a few counterterms to the canonical light - front hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> but for gauge theories ( both abelian and non - abelian ) under the given regularization , it proved necessary to introduce an infinite number of counterterms in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is closely related to the gauge condition @xmath35 , which is unavoidable in the canonical light - front quantization . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that to correctly construct the perturbation theory in this gauge , it is necessary to use the gauge field propagator in the form proposed by mandelstam and leibbrandt @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ; @xmath46 , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the additional pole in @xmath48 in this expression is cut out with the regularization @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion arising in this case does not disappear in the limit @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> an infinite number of counterterms is required to compensate this distortion .    </S>",

    "<S> in such a case , we must change the regularization . for this purpose , we propose shifting the pole with respect to @xmath48 in expression ( [ v.0 ] ) from the point @xmath51 by changing the lagrangian such that a small regularizing mass parameter @xmath52 is added to the quantity @xmath53 . in this case , the distortions caused by cutting out the interval @xmath54 are not so large as in the preceding case , and a finite number of counterterms is sufficient to obtain the correct hamiltonian in the limit of removing the regularization ( @xmath50 and then @xmath55 together with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a uv regularization parameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the uv regularization such that , after removing the ir regularization ( i.e. , after setting @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) at the intermediate stages , we obtain the lorentz - invariant lagrangian regularized in the uv region . </S>",
    "<S> this increases the number of `` ghosts , '' but the number of necessary counterterms would otherwise increase sharply . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the gauge @xmath35 , the one - particle irreducible vertex parts with the upper index `` @xmath60 '' do not contribute to the green s functions . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we prove the coincidence of every order of the perturbation theory in the limit of removing the regularization only for the green s functions and not for the vertex parts with the index `` @xmath60 '' . </S>",
    "<S> this is sufficient because the masses of the bound states are determined by the poles of the green s functions .    under the given regularization , the hamiltonian acts on the space with an indefinite metric , which prevents using the conventional variational principle to solve the schrodinger equation under the conditions of preserving the regularization . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there exist different variational methods that allow solving this equation .    </S>",
    "<S> the chosen regularization breaks the local gauge invariance but preserves the global @xmath61 invariance . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the number of necessary counterterms , being finite , is essentially larger than the conventional one . </S>",

    "<S> it is clear that in the one - loop order , there are no subdiagrams ; therefore , there are no essential ir divergences . then on considering a diagram containing factor ( [ 2.8 ] ) , for the lower order @xmath203 subdiagram , we have @xmath213 at @xmath214 ( just this estimate is obtained in appendix  4 ) . because the value @xmath203 at @xmath208 or @xmath215 does not give a contribution to the expression ( [ 2.8 ] ) then taking into account ( [ 2.9 ] ) we can maintain that accurate to @xmath216 the expression ( [ 2.8 ] ) coincides with @xmath217 where , as it was already said , the divergence is absent .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore if @xmath218 then in the limit @xmath169 the diagrams containing the factor of form ( [ 2.8 ] ) will not differ from their values calculated in the conventional perturbation theory under dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> more exactly a possible difference is due to the diagram divergence , but it is polynomial and is compensated by the counterterms of the same form that arise under the renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is now sufficient to prove that in the limit @xmath169 , the euclidean perturbation theory with propagator ( [ 2.6 ] ) , where we set @xmath59 , with the propagator @xmath178 , with interaction ( [ v.3 ] ) , and with restrictions ( [ v.6 ] ) removed coincides with the conventional perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> propagator ( [ 2.6 ] ) with @xmath59 after the transition to the euclidean space can be written down as @xmath219 this expression is lorentz - invariant if we assume that the vector @xmath220 ( complex in the euclidean space , such that @xmath221 , @xmath222 ) to be properly transformed under the lorentz transformation . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that there is no distinguished vector other than @xmath220 in the euclidean space , whereas in the pseudo - euclidean space , the mandelstam - leibbrandt prescription distinguishes the additional surface @xmath223 . </S>",
    "<S> however the vector @xmath220 is complex , and there is new fixed vector , namely , the complex conjugated to @xmath220 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that it coincides ( up to a factor ) with euclidean continuation of the vector @xmath224 , which is defined below the equation ( [ v.0 ] ) and picks out the surface @xmath225 in pseudoeuclidean space .    </S>",
    "<S> interaction lagrangian ( [ 2.2 ] ) is also lorentz - invariant ; therefore , the counterterms that must be added to the lagrangian under the renormalization in every order of the perturbation theory are lorentz - invariant . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in the appendix 4 that the values which it is necessary to add to the diagrams in order to in the limit @xmath169 make them finite and coincident with their values calculated using dimensional regularization are polynomials with respect to external momenta with the coefficients containing factors @xmath226 ( see the definition of this value in formula ( [ isp7 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we should take into account that in the counterterms the vector @xmath220 can not be contracted with the field @xmath227 , because we consider the feynman diagrams for the green s functions , whose external lines can not carry the upper index `` @xmath60 '' as it gives zero after convolution with the propagators . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the counterterms are globally gauge invariant because the initial lagrangian has this property . </S>",
    "<S> we now analyze the possible form of the counterterms .    </S>",
    "<S> there exist logarithmically divergent diagrams with four gluon external lines . in appendix  3 , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the structure of an arbitrary diagram of this type with respect to the labels of the gauge group can only have the form @xmath228 or @xmath229 . taking the lorentz invariance into account </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the general form of the corresponding counterterms is exhausted by the terms with the coefficients @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 in lagrangian ( [ v.3 ] ) and we can therefore replace the addition of the counterterms by a certain choice of these coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> there also exist divergent diagrams with three gluon external lines . in general </S>",
    "<S> , they can diverge linearly ; however , because of the lorentz invariance , the divergent part must contain the factor @xmath233 , and the divergence is really logarithmic . </S>",
    "<S> we show in appendix  3 that the structure of an arbitrary diagram of this type with respect to the labels of the gauge group can only have the form @xmath234 . for the general form of the divergence , this gives the terms with the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath235 in ( [ v.3 ] ) ( note , that the existence of the latter takes account of the volume @xmath226 appearance in the counterterms ) , and we can therefore replace the addition of counterterms by a certain choice of these coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there exist logarithmically divergent diagrams with two fermion and one gluon external lines . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the general form of the divergence is defined by the terms with the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath236 in ( [ v.3 ] ) and we can therefore replace the addition of counterterms by a certain choice of these coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> next , there exist divergent diagrams with two gluon external lines . </S>",
    "<S> they diverge quadratically , and the general form of the divergence is given by the term @xmath184 in ( [ v.3 ] ) . but after subtracting the quadratic divergence , a linear divergence can remain . because of the lorentz invariance , it is really absent , and only the logarithmic divergence exists . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the general form of this divergence is given by terms with the coefficients @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 in ( [ v.3 ] ) and we can therefore replace the addition of counterterms by a certain choice of these coefficients and coefficient @xmath184 . </S>",
    "<S> there also exist divergent diagrams with two fermion external lines . </S>",
    "<S> they diverge linearly , and the general form of the divergence is given by the term with the coefficient @xmath242 in ( [ v.3 ] ) . but after subtracting the linear divergence , a logarithmic divergence can remain . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that the perturbation theory with propagator ( [ isp6 ] ) , with the propagator @xmath178 and with interaction ( [ v.3 ] ) ( we must compare such a perturbation theory with the conventional one ) is renormalizable by renormalizing the coefficients @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that by properly adjusting the additions to the quantities @xmath82 in every order of the perturbation theory , i.e. , by manipulating the finite renormalizations , in the limit @xmath169 , we can achieve the coincidence of the value of every feynman diagram with its conventional value ( the corresponding scheme is briefly presented in appendix  4 ) . </S>",
