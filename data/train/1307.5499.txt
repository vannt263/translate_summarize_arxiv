    "the case of equality in this theorem is referred to as the rigidity statement .",
    "note that our hypothesis of strong asymptotic flatness implies the vanishing of the adm linear momentum . under weaker hypotheses ,",
    "in which the linear momentum is possibly non - zero , the rigidity statement was proved in refs .  .    two entirely different approaches to prove this theorem are relevant to our work in this paper",
    "the first one , due to schoen and yau was given in two installments , first in the maximal slice case , that is when @xmath23 , using minimal surface theory @xcite .",
    "this result was then used to prove the general case by applying the jang equation @xcite . the main idea in this second step",
    "is to look for a hypersurface @xmath24 , in the riemannian product @xmath25 , given as the graph of a function @xmath11 on @xmath1 , and such that its mean curvature satisfies @xmath26 . this last equation is known as the jang equation , and its validity ensures that the the scalar curvature of @xmath27 ( the induced metric on @xmath24 ) , is in some sense weakly nonnegative , so that there is a conformal metric @xmath28 with zero scalar curvature .",

    ", using a harmonic spinor @xmath29 , which tends to a constant spinor @xmath30 at infinity with @xmath31 , one derives an integral identity which exhibits the mass explicitly as the integral of a nonnegative quantity over @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "thus , we will assume that @xmath113 where @xmath114 indicates the presence of other added lower order terms . in order to see that the boundary is in fact a future apparent horizon with these asymptotics for @xmath11 ,",
    "let us note that @xmath115 therefore the distance to the boundary is given by @xmath116 we now compute the future null expansion of the coordinate spheres with respect to the initial data metric @xmath2 . a standard formula yields the mean curvature of coordinate spheres @xmath117 and the trace of the initial data @xmath3 over the coordinate spheres is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the induced metric on @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the christoffel symbols of @xmath2 .",

    "note that the @xmath130 slice of the majumdar - papapetrou spacetime does not fall under the hypotheses of this theorem , as it possesses cylindrical ends .",
    "this is related to the fact that we employ blow - up solutions of the generalized jang equation at the apparent horizon boundary . in order to treat initial data containing cylindrical ends ,",
    "more general boundary conditions for the generalized jang equation should be utilized .",
    "the starting point of the proof is the lichnerowicz identity , which now takes the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the following endomorphism of @xmath71 @xmath133 with @xmath134 the scalar curvature of the jang metric @xmath70 and @xmath135 the charge density on @xmath24 . applying   to the harmonic spinor @xmath29 ,",
    "taking the inner product with @xmath29 , and integrating by parts over @xmath54 produces @xmath136 the right hand side is the boundary term at spatial infinity , and no interior boundary terms appear in light of the asymptotics .",

    "now consider the case of equality in  .",
    "it follows that the harmonic spinor @xmath29 is covariantly constant @xmath149 .",
    "we now recall that @xmath150 is not metric compatible , so that although @xmath29 is parallel , @xmath151 is not constant .",
    "in fact , we show in the appendix  [ phi ] that @xmath152 satisfies the elliptic equation @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the laplace - beltrami operator with respect to @xmath70 . furthermore , it now follows from the energy condition  , as well as and , that at each point of @xmath1 either @xmath155 or @xmath156 . since @xmath157",
    "we may apply the hopf maximum principle to conclude that @xmath158 on the interior of @xmath1 .",
    "it then follows that in fact holds without any preconditions .",
    "in particular @xmath159 in conclusion , in view of   and @xmath160 , we find that @xmath161 is a time symmetric electrovacuum ( and asymptotically flat ) initial data set , with @xmath162 according to chrusciel , reall , and tod @xcite , the only such electrovacuum initial data is the mp initial data , and hence @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "we now have @xmath165 , so that the map @xmath166 yields an isometric embedding of @xmath17 into the spacetime @xmath167 .",

    "this , however , follows from previous work .",
    "namely , since @xmath171 it is shown in refs .   that @xmath3 is the desired second fundamental form , and the fact that @xmath33 is the induced electric field on the embedding is shown in ref .  .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ cpmt ] .",
    "in this section , we present evidence for the following conjecture .",
    "let @xmath32 be a strongly asymptotically flat initial data set for the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "then the dirac - jang system has a solution @xmath101 which satisfies and .",
    "we note that if proved , this statement , in conjunction with theorem  [ cpmt ] , would also give a proof of the following conjecture .",
    "let @xmath32 be a strongly asymptotically flat initial data set for the einstein - maxwell equations satisfying the charged dominant energy condition , with total mass @xmath127 and total charge @xmath128",
    ". then @xmath129 and equality holds if and only if @xmath32 arises from the majumdar - papapetrou spacetime .",
    "observe that the dirac - jang system is truly a coupled system of equations , since the metric appearing in the dirac equation depends on the solution to the generalized jang equation .",
    "however both are elliptic , or degenerate elliptic in the case of the generalized jang equation ( the degeneracy appears only at the horizons ) , and so we have the schauder estimates available to analyze ( heuristically ) whether it is possible to solve this set of equations .",
    "ultimately we would like to apply a standard iteration procedure to obtain existence .",
    "namely , pick an arbitrary positive function @xmath172 with the correct boundary conditions , and then use it to solve the generalized jang equation for @xmath173 .",
    "use @xmath172 and @xmath173 to construct @xmath174 , and then solve the dirac equation to obtain @xmath175 and hence @xmath176 . continuing in this way , we obtain sequences @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the appropriate estimates must be made if we are to show that this procedure converges .",
    "below we will perform a calculation which suggests that uniform estimates for the warping factor @xmath97 are possible .",
    "once this is accomplished , it is a relatively easy task to uniformly bound the corresponding solution of the generalized jang equation and the dirac equation .    to begin , recall that the warping factor is set",
    "to be the norm squared of the dirac spinor , that is @xmath152 . in the appendix  [ phi ]",
    "it is shown that @xmath97 solves an equation of the form @xmath179 where @xmath180 is a function of first derivatives of the spinor @xmath29 and first derivatives of @xmath70 .",
    "the scalar curvature has a nice form given by  . in this formula",
    "@xmath181 is the second fundamental form of the jang surface inside @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 are given by   , and @xmath56 is the extension to @xmath60 of the initial data @xmath3 given by @xmath185 we observe that the scalar curvature @xmath134 contains two derivatives of @xmath97 and three derivatives of @xmath11 , and thus it appears that by applying the schauder estimates to equation  , the best we could hope for is an estimate of the form @xmath186 which of course is of no help at all .",
    "however , below , we shall calculate the divergence term in the expression for the scalar curvature , and invoke the generalized jang equation , to show that this simple estimate may be improved .",
    "let @xmath121 and @xmath187 be the christoffel symbols for the initial data metric @xmath2 and the jang metric @xmath70 , respectively .",

    "we may now apply the schauder estimates to obtain an improvement of the estimate  : @xmath197 moreover it is clear from the structure of the generalized jang equation and the dirac equation , that one should have @xmath198 and @xmath199 since @xmath200 , we also have @xmath201 hence @xmath202 these heuristic arguments yield strong evidence for a uniform bound on @xmath97 , which as mentioned above , will lead to uniform bounds on @xmath11 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus it appears that existence of a solution for the dirac - jang system is highly likely , and rests on a uniform @xmath203 bound for @xmath97 .",
    "here we derive the equation   satisfied by the warping factor @xmath152 .",
    "write the connection   in the following way @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the metric compatible ( levi - civita ) connection and @xmath206 direct computation yields @xmath207 now use the lichnerowicz formula to obtain @xmath208 where @xmath209    in what follows , for convenience we will neglect the notation @xmath210 for clifford multiplication , and instead simply write @xmath211 .",
    "observe that @xmath212 here we have used the basic law of clifford multiplication , namely @xmath213 where @xmath214 denotes the spacetime metric .",
    "furthermore , we also observe that @xmath215 and therefore @xmath216 it follows that @xmath217 moreover @xmath218 since @xmath219 , as the jang initial data is assumed to have no extrinsic curvature .",

    "namely , in this case the spinor @xmath29 is covariantly constant with respect to the connection @xmath150 , @xmath226 , and   holds .",
