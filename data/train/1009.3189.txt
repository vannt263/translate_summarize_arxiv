    "the influence of environment on the properties of galaxies and their evolution has become evident over the last three decades . among the early evidence for an environmental effect on galaxy evolution was the discovery of the morphology - density relation @xcite , showing that morphologies of cluster galaxies are not randomly distributed , but depend on the distance from the cluster centre , or alternatively on the local density in which a galaxy resides .",
    "another early study by @xcite showed that the two - point correlation function , measured using a catalogue of preferentially selected field galaxies , depends on galaxy morphology .",
    "we have since learned that not only galaxy morphology depends on environment , but also the mean age of a galaxy s stellar population is affected : galaxies in low - density environments appear on average 1 - 2 gyr younger than their counterparts in high density environments like galaxy clusters , or local overdensities in galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "this was also shown by @xcite , who found that among a population of early - type galaxies , field ellipticals tend to present populations about 1 gyr younger than those in clusters .",
    "recently , @xcite found evidence for a correlation between age and environment at fixed stellar mass , such that galaxies in higher density regions formed earlier than galaxies of similar mass in lower density environments .",
    "similar evidence comes from studies of galaxy clustering .",
    "@xcite analysed the correlations between galaxy colours and the environment using marked correlation functions and argued that , in order to explain the observed colour dependence , a significant fraction of faint satellite galaxies must be blue .",
    "@xcite argued that much of the correlations between morphologies and the environment are explained by the colour - environment correlation .    on the other hand , the star formation histories , colours and morphologies of galaxies are very sensitive to galaxy stellar mass ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the higher the stellar mass of a galaxy the earlier , shorter and more intense the initial burst of star formation .",
    "the peak in the star formation activity then shifts to lower mass galaxies as cosmic time proceeds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the relative importance of the various factors in shaping the galaxies that we observe today is unclear .",
    "what are the roles of stellar mass , total galaxy mass , and parent dark matter halo mass ? what has a stronger influence , local density or membership in a massive structure ?",
    "is being a ` satellite ' or a ` central ' galaxy an important factor , as recently suggested by e.g. @xcite and @xcite ?",
    "there is considerable previous work addressing these questions .",
    "@xcite showed that most environmental correlations can be explained by two galaxy properties , colour and luminosity , and that correlations with structural properties are less important .",
    "@xcite find that metallicity and @xmath5-enhancement are independent of environment , but correlate with galaxy velocity dispersion , i.e. , the galaxy s dark matter halo mass . on the other hand @xcite",
    "argue that galaxy properties are only related to the mass of its parent dark matter halo , i.e. , the total mass of the structure in which a galaxy resides .",
    "@xcite similarly emphasize the importance of group halo mass .",
    "they furthermore find that the properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with those of their central galaxy .",
    "@xcite find that galaxy structure depends strongly on stellar mass , while star formation history is very sensitive to local density .",
    "recently , @xcite showed the presence of a morphology - density relation at fixed stellar mass using galaxy zoo morphologies .",
    "however , they do not find a dependence of morphology on group mass , either determined from the velocity dispersion or the integrated group light .",
    "looking at higher redshifts ( @xmath6 ) , the correlations found in the local universe seem to be either already in place or reversed .",
    "a strong dependence of galaxy colours on local projected number density was found by @xcite up to @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand find that the colour - density relation present at @xmath8 progressively disappears until it is undetectable at @xmath9 .",
    "the morphology - density relation was found to be already in place at @xmath6 over a wide range of densities from cluster cores to the field @xcite .",
    "stellar mass seems to set an upper limit to this density dependence : @xcite found that above m@xmath10 morphology does not evolve or depend on environment up to @xmath11 , a result confirmed by @xcite .",
    "they also argue that the lower fraction of blue galaxies in groups with respect to the field is mainly caused by luminosity selected samples biased towards blue low - mass galaxies .",
    "the colour difference largely disappears when stellar mass selected samples are used .",
    "the relation between sfr and local density at high @xmath12 is controversial too .",
    "the sfr - density relation found for sdss galaxies locally seems to be reversed at higher redshifts : @xcite and @xcite find galaxies with higher sfr are located in higher densities at @xmath11 .",
    "however , the opposite was found by @xcite , who observe the same strong decline of sfr with density at @xmath13 as in the sdss .",
    "the contradictory results of the above studies may be partly due to the problematic and manifold definitions of what a galaxy environment is , and how to quantify it .",
    "the options include ( 1 ) group or cluster membership , compared to the rather ill - defined ` field ' , ( 2 ) local number densities , based on number counts in a fixed aperture , or the distance to the @xmath14 nearest neighbour , where both , the choice of aperture -size or @xmath15 introduce an arbitrary element , and ( 3 ) the dark matter halo mass , based on halo occupation models .",
    "galaxy stellar mass itself , usually regarded as an intrinsic property of a galaxy , may also depend on environment , as suggested by the stellar mass - halo mass correlation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "massive elliptical galaxies are often found in the cores of galaxy clusters , or at high local densities , while lower mass spirals are located in the outskirts of larger structures or in small groups , as our local group .",
    "however , this traditional view is not necessarily always the case : massive ellipticals are also found in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and low - mass galaxies with elliptical morphology are found preferentially in high local densities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is hence not clear if , and how , a galaxy s stellar mass depends on the environment and how this dependence evolves with redshift .",
    "high redshift studies have additional problems : deep surveys usually cover a small area , suffering from the problem of cosmic variance .",
    "another issue is the limited availability of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "photometric redshifts , even quite accurate ones , make it difficult to accurately define environments since they smear out structures along the line of sight .",
    "this is especially problematic at low densities @xcite .",
    "we approach this problem with the combination of a deep infrared survey covering a large field of view , the powir survey , and the deep2 redshift survey providing the spectroscopic redshifts for a large number of objects .",
    "additionally , our galaxy sample is selected in the @xmath16-band .",
    "the near infrared bands are a much better proxy for stellar mass than optical bands , since they are sensitive to the light of old , low - mass stars and less sensitive to the effects of dust .",
    "optical colours correspond to rest - frame uv light , which traces young and hot stellar populations , and thus is more sensitive to star formation than stellar mass .",
    "the near - ir selection therefore corresponds to a selection based on stellar mass rather than star - formation .",
    "this allows us to study correlations with stellar mass without the colour bias of optical luminosity selected samples @xcite .",
    "section  [ the sample ] describes the two surveys and the resulting samples used in this study .",
    "the ways in which we characterise a galaxy s environment is explained in section  [ character ] .",
    "section  [ results ] presents our results , section  [ discussion ] discusses its implications and section  [ conclusion ] summarizes our most important findings .",
    "we assume the standard @xmath17cdm cosmology and a flat universe with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and a relative hubble constant @xmath20 is used .",
    "this study is based on data obtained by the palomar observatory wide - field infrared ( powir ) survey described in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this survey is to construct a @xmath16-band selected and stellar mass limited sample covering a large field of view , and containing a large number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the powir survey covers four fields : the extended groth strip ( egs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and three additional fields subsequently referred to as field 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "all four fields have been observed by the deep2 ( deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ) redshift survey @xcite .",
    "deep @xmath21 and @xmath22-band imaging was obtained with the wirc camera on the palomar 5 m telescope .",
    "the survey consists of 75 pointings covering an area of @xmath231.5 deg@xmath24 with an average 5@xmath25 depth reaching down to @xmath26 . for a detailed description of the observations and data reduction procedures",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the corresponding optical data come from the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) using the cfh12k camera .",
    "imaging in the bands @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 was taken , reaching a 5@xmath25 depth of @xmath30 .",
    "the details of these observations and their reduction are given in @xcite .",
    "the seeing is comparable in the infrared and optical data ( @xmath31 arcsec ) .",
    "all photometry was measured within a 2 arcsec diameter aperture .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts were obtained with the keck deimos spectrograph @xcite as a part of the deep2 redshift survey @xcite .",
    "targets were selected down to @xmath32 independent of their colour in the egs field , whereas in fields 2 , 3 and 4 targets were additionally selected based on @xmath33 and @xmath34 colour , focusing on selecting galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "the spectroscopic sampling rate is about 60% in all four fields . together with the spectroscopic success rate of @xmath36 this yields an overall spectroscopic completeness of @xmath37 in all four fields over a redshift range of @xmath0 .",
    "the different target selection criteria in fields 2 , 3 , 4 and the egs lead to an overall smaller number of galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath3 , since objects in this range come mainly from the egs field .",
    "this redshift interval thus has a smaller surveyed volume relative to the higher redshift range of @xmath38 .",
    "the photometric catalogue of galaxies detected in the @xmath22-band images with the sextractor package @xcite was then matched to the deep2 redshift catalogue .",
    "the matching between the @xmath28-band selected redshift catalogue and the k - band selected photometric catalogue was done within a 1 arcsec radius .",
    "this results in a very low rate of spurious matches of 1 - 2% due to the low surface densities in both catalogues @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic sample is magnitude limited at @xmath39 due to the deep2 target selection limit , whereas the @xmath22-band selected photometric catalogue has a magnitude limit of @xmath30 .",
    "this leads to a lower percentage of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath40 , see @xcite ) in the photometric catalogue than the spectroscopic completeness of @xmath41 quoted above .",
    "for all galaxies in the @xmath22-band selected photometric sample , which have no measured spectroscopic redshift , we measure photometric redshifts . this procedure is described in the following section . for a more detailed description of the sample selection and an extensive discussion of the completeness we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift sample is complemented by photometric redshifts measured from the optical and ir photometry described above . for galaxies that meet the spectroscopic target selection , but were not observed due to instrumental constraints , the neural network code annz @xcite was used .",
    "this includes all galaxies brighter than @xmath39 , which were either not sampled spectroscopically ( @xmath42 of galaxies in our catalogue with @xmath39 ) or which have no reliable spectroscopic redshift measurement ( @xmath43 of spectroscopically observed galaxies ) .",
    "this sample of galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath44 of the total @xmath22-band selected sample ) cover the same magnitude range as galaxies with spectroscopic redshift , which can therefore be used at a training set for the annz neural network code .",
    "photometric redshifts of galaxies fainter than @xmath39 were measured with the bpz package @xcite , which uses a bayesian approach , including information about the likelihood of a certain redshift - brightness combination , taken from the distribution of galaxies in the hubble deep field @xcite .",
    "bpz is well suited for determining photometric redshifts of faint galaxies , for which no comparison sample with spectroscopic redshifts is available .",
    "the photometric redshift accuracy is good out to @xmath45 with an uncertainty of @xmath46 @xcite . for a detailed description of the photometric redshift estimates we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the numbers of galaxies in the full sample ( spectroscopic redshifts plus additional photometric redshifts ) and the spec - z sample ( secure spectroscopic redshifts only ) are as follows : the full sample has 50,119 galaxies , while the spec - z sample comprises 10,682 galaxies .",
    "stellar masses were estimated by fitting the optical and near infrared photometric datapoints with synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from @xcite spanning a variety of galaxy ages , metallicities and star formation histories .",
    "we use an exponentially declining star formation history with an e - folding time between 0.01 and 10 gyr and ages of the star formation onset between 0 and 10 gyr .",
    "the metallicities span a range of 0.0001 to 0.05 .",
    "the typical uncertainties of the model sed fitting is @xmath23 0.1 - 0.2 dex .",
    "adding to this the photometric errors yields a total stellar mass uncertainty of 0.2 - 0.3 dex .",
    "we note that for intermediate age stellar populations the stellar masses can be systematically overestimated .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , for the present sample the masses are lower by on average 0.07 dex only , when using models with agb - tp stars .",
    "another source of systematic error is the choice of imf . here",
    ", the imf of @xcite is used .",
    "the details of the stellar mass measurements are fully described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also estimate the completeness limits in stellar mass from the @xmath22-band detection limit at different redshifts by placing model galaxies at the high redshift end of each redshift bin . for a redshift of @xmath6",
    "they find that the full sample ( including galaxies with photometric redshifts ) is 100% complete down to a stellar mass of @xmath47 .",
    "galaxies down to this stellar mass and redshift limit are detected independently of their colour .",
    "our sample is therefore not strongly biased towards bluer galaxies at high @xmath12 .",
    "we use a stellar mass limit of @xmath47 and a redshift limit of @xmath48 throughout this paper .    out of the 50,119 galaxies in our whole catalogue 14,563",
    "are above the stellar mass limit @xmath49 and below the redshift limit @xmath50 and hence are included in this study .",
    "4101 of these galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the final full sample therefore has 14,563 galaxies , and the spec - z sample has 4101 galaxies .",
    "rest - frame @xmath51 colours were derived by @xcite in the vega magnitude system . all magnitudes and colours used in this paper",
    "are converted into the ab magnitude system .",
    "the transformation between the vega and ab system is a linear shift given by the ab magnitude of vega in the respective filter .",
    "the @xmath51 colours used in this study can be transformed in the following way : @xmath55 = @xmath56 + 0.83 @xcite .",
    "the blue fraction is defined as the fraction of galaxies that have not reached the red sequence yet .",
    "it is computed with the magnitude dependent colour limit defined by @xcite . by fitting the red sequence of the colour - magnitude relation of the deep2 sample they found a clear distinction between the red sequence and the blue cloud up to about @xmath11 .",
    "the colour limit separating these two populations is defined to be @xmath57 magnitudes blueward of the red sequence , given by the following equation ( shifted into the ab magnitude system ) :    @xmath58    here we not only compute fractions of galaxies on the red sequence , @xmath54 , and in the blue cloud , @xmath52 , but we also quantify the number of galaxies located in the transition region between blue and red , i.e. , the fraction of galaxies in the ` green valley ' , @xmath53 . to identify these green galaxies we assume a width of the green valley of @xmath59 starting at 0.15 magnitudes blueward of the red sequence .",
    "red galaxies are then defined as    @xmath60    and blue galaxies as    @xmath61    while all galaxies in between are green .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the colour limits in the colour magnitude diagram in three redshift bins .",
    "the red line corresponds to the red sequence of @xcite , while the green line shows the limit blueward of which galaxies are considered to lie in the green valley .",
    "galaxies below the blue line are considered blue cloud systems .",
    "this section describes the different environment measures we use in this study .",
    "we use two different approaches : the first one is based on measuring the distance to the @xmath15-th nearest neighbours of each galaxy within a redshift slice , while the second one uses all galaxies within a certain physical radius and radial velocity interval .",
    "@xcite measured the third nearest neighbour densities of galaxies in the deep2 sample , which we utilize here .",
    "the choice of @xmath15 for @xmath15-th nearest neighbour distances was found to have a weak influence on the resulting density values @xcite .",
    "@xcite also investigated possible effects of the selection function of the deep2 survey and conclude that it does not introduce any environmental bias , at least up to @xmath11 .",
    "the method used to determine the nearest neighbour densities is fully described in @xcite and @xcite . only galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts",
    "are used in measuring local densities .",
    "first the projected distance @xmath62 to the third nearest neighbour within a radial velocity window of @xmath63 km s@xmath64 is measured .",
    "this is then converted into a surface density @xmath65 . to account for different sampling rates of the deep2 survey at different redshifts ,",
    "@xmath66 is divided by the mean surface density @xmath67 in slices of @xmath68 .",
    "this yields the relative overdensity @xmath69 , which is not affected by redshift - dependent incompleteness .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath70 is not denoted @xmath71 , but by @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath71 itself is the overdensity defined as @xmath72 .",
    "using @xmath73 is convenient for separating the sample into over- and underdense regions : if @xmath73 is positive , the galaxy is located in an overdense region , while a negative @xmath73 corresponds to an underdense area relative to the mean density at each redshift .    to minimize edge effects",
    ", we exclude galaxies closer than 1 @xmath2 mpc to a survey border . out of the 4101 galaxies in the spectroscopic redshift sample , 486 galaxies are within the 1 @xmath2 mpc border region and excluded from the further analysis . the sample used in the local density analysis",
    "then consists of 3615 galaxies .",
    "in addition to the nearest neighbour densities , which are expressed as relative overdensities , the absolute local density for each galaxy is calculated by counting neighbouring galaxies within a certain fixed radius ( or aperture ) , and a fixed radial velocity interval .",
    "this search radius is chosen to be 1 @xmath2 mpc , which gives the best correlation ( as we will show below ) between number of neighbours , their velocity dispersion and the parent dark matter halo mass based on the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "we show this by using a light - cone catalogue produced from the full simulation within a box of 500 @xmath2 mpc on each side .",
    "the dark matter haloes are populated with galaxies according to the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) models of @xcite .",
    "galaxy luminosities are computed according to the model described in @xcite .",
    "the light - cone catalogue is fully described in @xcite .",
    "it comprises positions , distances and magnitudes for 954,212 simulated galaxies down to an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath74 .",
    "the distances include the peculiar motions of the galaxies and are converted into radial velocities using the relative hubble constant @xmath75 , as it is used in the simulation .",
    "the number densities and galaxy velocity dispersion within different fixed apertures of 1 , 2 , and 5 @xmath2 mpc and a velocity window of @xmath761000 km  s@xmath64 is computed .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the relation between the measured velocity dispersion of all galaxies within the fixed aperture and velocity interval as a tracer of the halo mass and the halo mass from the simulation itself .",
    "the different apertures are shown as blue stars ( 5 @xmath2 mpc ) , green crosses ( 2 @xmath2 mpc ) and red squares ( 1 @xmath2 mpc ) .",
    "the errorbars show the @xmath77 dispersion in each bin . within an aperture of 5 @xmath2 mpc",
    "there is no relation between halo mass ( @xmath78 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath79 ) : @xmath79 has a value of around 500 km s@xmath64 at all halo masses . at 2 @xmath2 mpc @xmath79 starts to be sensitive to the halo mass , but the relation flattens off at @xmath80 and @xmath81 km s@xmath64 . using 1 @xmath2 mpc the relation becomes steeper and we are able to trace the parent dark matter halo mass down to @xmath82 or @xmath83 km s@xmath64 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the radial velocity interval within which neighbouring galaxies are included is set to @xmath84 km  s@xmath64 .",
    "this choice may sound arbitrary , however it is motivated by the distribution of galaxies in our survey : the vast majority of galaxies in the deep2 survey are either isolated or located in galaxy groups , not in clusters @xcite .",
    "a velocity of 1000 km  s@xmath64 corresponds to the escape velocity of a massive galaxy group with a velocity dispersion of @xmath85 km  s@xmath64 .",
    "and velocity dispersion @xmath79 computed within different circular apertures and a radial velocity interval of @xmath84 km  s@xmath64 .",
    "the results for the different apertures are shown as blue stars ( 5 @xmath2 mpc ) , green crosses ( 2 @xmath2 mpc ) and red squares ( 1 @xmath2 mpc ) .",
    "the errorbars give the @xmath86 dispersion in each bin .",
    "a small shift in @xmath78 is applied for a better visualization of the errorbars .",
    "[ fig2],scaledwidth=47.7% ]    from all galaxies found within the fixed aperture and velocity interval we then compute the following quantities :    1 .",
    "radial velocity dispersion @xmath79 and the virial mass @xmath87 as a halo mass estimator ; 2 .",
    "harmonic radius @xmath88 as a compactness estimator ; 3 .   crossing time @xmath89 as a dynamical state estimator ; 4 .   the offset in projection and velocity ,",
    "relative to the average , @xmath28 ; 5 .",
    "number of neighbours @xmath90 within 1 @xmath2 mpc as a richness estimator .",
    "the definitions of the above quantities are given in the following .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion of a group structure is defined as :    @xmath91^\\frac{1}{2 } \\\\\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is the radial velocity of each galaxy and @xmath93 is the mean velocity of all @xmath90 galaxies within the 1 @xmath2 mpc radius .",
    "the mean harmonic radius ( @xmath88 ) is a measure of the compactness .",
    "it gives the mean projected separation between all objects in a galaxy s environment , i.e. , the compactness of the environment .",
    "this is related to the local density , such that a galaxy in a high local density will have a small @xmath88 .",
    "however , also a low local density can result in a small @xmath88 , if the galaxy is part of an isolated close pair or triple .",
    "@xmath88 is calculated from the projected separations @xmath94 between the i - th and j - th galaxy :    @xmath95^{-1}\\ ] ]    from the velocity dispersion ( @xmath79 ) and the mean harmonic radius ( @xmath88 ) , the crossing time ( @xmath89 ) is computed following the definition of @xcite :    @xmath96    the crossing time describes how long it would take the average galaxy moving with the velocity @xmath79 to cross its local environment defined by @xmath88 .",
    "multiplying @xmath89 with h@xmath97 gives the crossing time in units of the age of the universe , independent of the choice of h@xmath97 .",
    "the inverse of this quantity then estimates how often the galaxy could have crossed its environment within the universe s lifetime .",
    "the crossing time is also an indicator of dynamical equilibrium : crossing times of about @xmath98 of a hubble time indicate that a structure is possibly virialized @xcite . + as an indicator of a galaxy s parent dark matter halo mass , the virial mass ( @xmath87 ) was computed following @xcite :    @xmath99    where g is the gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath87 is a straightforward and useful halo mass estimator , given that the structure is in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that calculated with a small number of objects the virial mass can be underestimated by a factor of 3 - 5 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28-parameter has been proposed by @xcite in order to facilitate the comparison between the distribution of galaxies in projection and in velocity space .",
    "it indicates the position of a galaxy relative to the average offset from the projected centre of space and velocity .",
    "it is defined as @xmath100    where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denotes the rms deviations in projected distance and peculiar velocity respectively of all galaxies within the 1 @xmath2 mpc radius . a galaxy with a large distance @xmath103 from the geometric centre or a large offset from the mean velocity @xmath104 will yield a large value of @xmath28 while an average galaxy should have @xmath105 .",
    "a small @xmath28 then indicates that the galaxy is closer to the centre in space and velocity than the average galaxy , which can be interpreted as being more likely at rest in ( or close to ) the centre of the potential well of the parent structure or dark matter halo .",
    "in the following we present our results in two ways , comparing the full sample ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 combined ) and for galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts only . the photometric redshifts are not suited to compute dynamical quantities , since the typical uncertainties of @xmath108 are much larger than the typical velocity dispersion of galaxy groups .",
    "however , for comparison reasons we plot the obtained values next to the ones obtained by using spectroscopic redshifts only in figures  [ fig4 ]  and  [ fig5 ] .",
    "as described in section  [ the sample ] our sample consists of galaxies down to a stellar mass of @xmath109 up to a redshift of @xmath48 . to avoid",
    "edge effects , galaxies with a distance from the border of the surveyed field of less than 1 @xmath2 mpc were excluded in the following analysis .",
    "first we compare the two local density estimators , @xmath90 and @xmath69 as described in section  [ character ] , then we describe the evolution of the environmental characteristics ( @xmath79 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath28 and @xmath90 ) and the rest - frame colours with cosmic time .",
    "we then investigate the correlation between colours and fraction of red , green and blue galaxies with local density , halo mass and stellar mass . and finally , to disentangle the influence of stellar mass and local density on galaxy colour , the sample is split in different bins of stellar mass and local density .      as described in section  [ character ] ,",
    "two different methods are used to estimate richness / density : the number of neighbours within a fixed aperture , @xmath90 , and the nearest neighbour density , @xmath69 , based on the distance to the @xmath110 nearest neighbour , measured by @xcite .",
    "the same population of galaxies is used to measure the two local density estimators . only galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts",
    "are used when comparing @xmath69 with @xmath90 .",
    "although the two values should roughly agree overall , they trace different things : @xmath90 is equivalent to an absolute co - moving density , while @xmath69 is a relative _ over-_density , i.e. , density normalized by the mean density in the galaxy s respective redshift interval ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the nearest neighbour density is an adaptive measurement that is well suited to characterize local galaxy concentrations on small scales , which might not be identified as density enhancements by the fixed aperture density .",
    "furthermore it gives a continuous range of densities , while the fixed aperture density can by construction only have discreet values , increasing the intrinsic uncertainty of the measurement . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath15-th nearest neighbour density is more sensitive to interlopers , since due to the variable area , the resulting density can change significantly due to the presence of a single object , especially when a small @xmath15 is used .",
    "we decided not to convert @xmath90 into units of mpc@xmath112 but to leave it in number of galaxies within the aperture .",
    "since the aperture is the same for all galaxies , this has no effect on the results , but allows us to easily determine how many galaxies our results are based upon .     and richness @xmath113 .",
    "the errorbars show the 1@xmath25 spread in each bin .",

    "is the slight redshift evolution of the density - stellar mass relation shown in figure  [ fig12 ] due to an evolution of stellar mass at a given density or a change in density at a given stellar mass ?",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows the redshift evolution of stellar mass at different local densities ( left panel ) and the redshift evolution of local density at different stellar masses ( right panel ) . the weak correlation between stellar mass and density is visible , however",
    ", the stellar mass at a given density does not evolve with time .",
    "the same is true for the evolution of densities at a given stellar mass , apart from the most massive galaxies which show a strong evolution of relative overdensity with time .",
    "their environments change from about average densities to more than ten times the average , overdense regions .",
    "the same increase is seen in the number of neighbours @xmath90 as discussed earlier ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this can be explained in terms of dynamical friction : since massive galaxies are more likely to be at the centre of their structure , neighbours are more likely to accumulate in their environment , increasing their local density over time . in our sample",
    "we indeed see evidence for the massive galaxies to be more likely located in the centre of mass and velocity of a galaxy association ( see discussion of the @xmath28 parameter in section  [ rparam ] ) .     and stellar mass @xmath181 in the three redshift bins .",
    "the errorbars represent the @xmath86 spread in each bin .",
    "[ fig12],scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "in the following we discuss the implications of the results presented above and compare them with results from the literature .",
    "overall , we do not find a relation between galaxy stellar mass and radial velocity dispersion of galaxies within the galaxy s environment , or mass of the dark matter halo ( as measured by @xmath87 ) .",
    "this may partly be caused by the high uncertainties in measuring virial masses , due to the intrinsic low number of galaxies in the structures we probe here , possible interlopers or the possibility that some structures are unvirialized .",
    "however , as illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , the velocity dispersions we measure are tracing halo masses in the millennium simulation down to @xmath224 .",
    "the lack of a ( strong ) correlation between stellar mass and virial mass is a challenge for models of hierarchical structure formation , since they expect more massive galaxies to be located in more massive structures ( or parent dark matter haloes ) .",
    "the environmental parameters do not change significantly with redshift , apart from @xmath88 , which decreases with redshift at all stellar masses , and @xmath28 , @xmath90 and @xmath69 for the most massive galaxies ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "we find that the most massive galaxies tend to be more likely central galaxies ( smaller @xmath28-parameter ) .",
    "they also move closer to the centre of mass and velocity of the structure , as suggested by decreasing @xmath28 with decreasing redshift .",
    "the most massive galaxies are located in higher absolute local densities ( @xmath90 ) as well as in higher relative overdensities @xmath69 and accrete more galaxies over time , both in absolute numbers ( @xmath90 ) and relative to the average ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this can be explained by dynamical friction and is in general agreement with the expectations of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the increase in local densities and number of companions might increase the rate at which merging is happening in these structures .",
    "@xcite measure the merger rates for galaxies in our sample from morphological parameters and do not find an increasing merger rate with redshift for massive galaxies .",
    "the fraction of distorted ellipticals , however , is increasing in the same redshift range , reaching a maximum of about 30% at @xmath225 @xcite , which could be connected to the increasing local densities .",
    "some of the environmental parameters are connected to intrinsic galaxy properties of colour and stellar mass : we find a correlation between colour and local density , overdensity and compactness , as well as between local density , compactness and stellar mass , as discussed in the following .",
    "there is a very strong correlation between galaxy colour and stellar mass ( @xmath226 significance ) at all redshifts .",
    "this colour - stellar mass relation evolves only slightly with redshift .",
    "the stellar mass where red and blue fractions cross over , i.e. , where there is an equal fraction of blue and red galaxies , occurs on average at @xmath227 and evolves slightly from @xmath228 at high @xmath12 to @xmath229 at low @xmath12 . in the local universe",
    "this transition occurs at lower stellar masses : using the sdss @xcite find a sharp transition from the dominance of blue to red galaxies at @xmath230 .",
    "our results also agree with the findings of a recent study by @xcite who investigate the relationship between colour , stellar mass and environment up to @xmath13 .",
    "they find a qualitatively similar strong dependence of the blue fraction on stellar mass in all environments studied ( groups , field and isolated galaxies ) .",
    "we find a weak correlation between colour and local density ( @xmath231 significance ) for the whole sample and also a weak correlation between density and stellar mass ( @xmath120 significance ) .",
    "the colour - density and density - stellar mass relations change in a similar way with redshift : both relations are most significant at intermediate redshifts , and they both disappear at high @xmath12 .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous similar studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a similar progressive disappearance of the colour - density relation with redshift , even though they use galaxy densities measured on much larger scales of 5 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "@xcite however find that a strong relation between colour and local density persists out to @xmath232 .",
    "this might partly be caused by their sample selection , which is rest - frame @xmath27-band luminosity limited .",
    "we can not confirm the colour - density relation at @xmath156 in our @xmath16-band selected sample .",
    "if the sample is split up in different stellar mass bins , the colour - density relation disappears completely for lowest and highest mass galaxies , remaining only in the stellar mass range @xmath4 , although at a lower significance than for the whole sample .",
    "we conclude that the overall colour - density relation is powered by these intermediate mass galaxies , as well as by the fact that there are more low - mass galaxies at lower densities and vice versa .",
    "stellar mass and relative overdensity are not strongly correlated , however , the correlation accounts for most of the colour - density relation seen in our sample . in other words ,",
    "the colour - density relation is a combination of a strong colour - stellar mass relation and a weak stellar mass - density relation .",
    "the strong colour - stellar mass relation is present at all local densities and it does not vary with density , apart from possibly in the lowest redshift bin of @xmath3 .",
    "the colours of galaxies at a given stellar mass are very similar at all local densities .",
    "these results are supporting the evidence emerging from previous studies using stellar mass limited samples , suggesting that the density dependence of galaxy colours is regulated mainly by stellar mass .",
    "the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies depend on the environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to the observed colour - density relation .",
    "the variations in relative numbers of red and blue galaxies can be explained in terms of variations of the stellar mass function with environment , which are present as early as @xmath11 and are becoming stronger towards lower redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite ( and similarly @xcite ) suggest the presence of a limiting stellar mass ( @xmath233 ) above which a galaxy s shape and colour is mainly correlated to its stellar mass rather than its environment .",
    "@xcite study the morphology - density relation at @xmath234 , using 207 galaxies from the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) down to @xmath235 and compare them to a similar mass selected sample from the sdss containing 2003 galaxies at @xmath236 .",
    "they find a strong morphology - density relation for massive galaxies which has remained constant since at least @xmath237 .",
    "however , they detect an increasing early - type fraction only above absolute densities of @xmath238 mpc@xmath112 ( their highest density ` field ' data point ) and in the two high density points representing the cluster environment .",
    "this might explain why we detect a relatively weak density dependence , since the deep2 survey does not cover the high density cluster environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the intermediate mass galaxies , which still show a colour - density relation , also show the most colour evolution with redshift , reddening substantially between @xmath6 and @xmath239 .",
    "interestingly , they also have the highest fraction of green valley galaxies , i.e. , galaxies possibly in transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "this suggests that in the redshift range we observe those intermediate mass galaxies are transiting from blue to red in environments of higher local densities .",
    "this is consistent with the results of a recent study of blue fractions in galaxy groups up to @xmath13 @xcite , who find that blue fractions of intermediate mass galaxies show an environmental dependence which is not seem for galaxies with higher and lower stellar mass .",
    "the mean colour of a galaxy s environment is as well sensitive to the galaxy s stellar mass : the most massive galaxies are surrounded by redder galaxies .",
    "the difference in the mean environment colour @xmath149 is however small with only 0.1 - 0.2 magnitudes between the lowest and the highest mass galaxies .",
    "we also find a correlation between colour and compactness of the group structure ( @xmath88 ) and perhaps between colour and crossing times @xmath89 , but only in the redshift range @xmath129 .",
    "the colour - compactness relation has a slightly lower statistical significance than the colour - density relation , but is still significant at @xmath155 in the redshift range @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath88 can be small also at low densities , this suggests that galaxy colour may be influenced by the presence of a close neighbour regardless of the local density .",
    "there is no significant correlation between galaxy colour and parent dark matter halo mass in our redshift range , however , there is a trend such that the most massive haloes are populated by bluer galaxies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "this is different to what was found at lower redshifts .",
    "@xcite investigate sdss group galaxies in a redshift range @xmath241 and find a weak correlation between colour and halo mass : high - mass haloes are populated by redder galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite use a different method to estimate the total group mass ( or halo mass ) : they use the integrated group light as a halo mass estimator .",
    "since there is a correlation between galaxy colour and galaxy luminosity , this approach may automatically lead to a correlation between galaxy colour and group halo mass .",
    "@xcite investigated the relation between morphology and group halo mass in the galaxy zoo sample and found no correlation between morphology and group mass , measured either by group velocity dispersion or integrated light . a correlation between colour and halo mass for",
    "_ central _ galaxies was found by @xcite , who argue that central galaxies in more massive haloes tend to have redder colours .",
    "what we investigate here is somewhat different from the results of @xcite : we investigate whether more massive haloes are inhabited by on average redder galaxies , taking into account all galaxies at the respective halo mass , not only the central galaxies .",
    "we do not find any significant differences between average colour and colour fractions of galaxies in haloes of different mass based on our virial mass measurements , apart from a weak trend at intermediate redshift that higher mass haloes have higher fractions of blue galaxies .",
    "the fact that the relation between colour and stellar mass is much stronger than the relation between colour and environmental parameters might be partly due to the fact that stellar masses can be measured more accurately than environment .",
    "the expected error of the stellar masses is about 0.3 dex , or about a factor of 2 , while the uncertainty of the virial mass due to low galaxy numbers is a factor of 3 - 5 , corresponding to 0.5 - 0.7 dex .",
    "the 1@xmath25 error of the nearest neighbour densities , estimated by comparison with deep2 mock catalogues @xcite , is 0.5 in units of @xmath242 , a factor of about 3 , similar to the uncertainty in the virial mass .",
    "there is the possibility that the high uncertainty in virial mass washes out any weak trends between galaxy colour , colour fractions and halo mass .",
    "however , the uncertainties in virial mass are similar to the uncertainties in local density and we do detect an overall colour - density relation in our sample .",
    "another issue is the range of environments sampled by the powir / deep2 survey : the survey contains hardly any massive galaxy clusters , i.e. systems with more than 10 members and velocity dispersions above @xmath243 km s@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the lack of this type of environment certainly influences the measured colour - density relation in our sample , since some of the processes that are density dependent and that most efficiently influence galaxy colours , like ram pressure stripping or galaxy harassment are only occurring in very massive structures : ram pressure stripping requires the presence of high velocities and a high density intra cluster medium , both retained by a deep potential well of a high - mass structure .",
    "equally galaxy harassment , defined as repeated high velocity encounters , can only occur in massive structures with a high velocity dispersion like galaxy clusters .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind , that galaxy clusters are not a very typical environment and that the evolution of an average galaxy does not involve the cluster environment .",
    "the lack of massive clusters in our sample is therefore not a significant bias for quantifying the environmental influence on the evolution of an average galaxy .",
    "the stellar mass limited full sample used in this study consists of 14,563 galaxies , @xmath244 of which ( 4101 galaxies ) have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "these numbers allow us to compare the results for the full and spec - z only sample and discuss the limitations of photometric redshifts in this context .    as discussed above the velocity related environmental characteristics are very sensitive to the inclusion of photometric redshifts , and need the accuracy of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the mean value of the velocity dispersion using the full sample is @xmath245 km s@xmath64 , which is the result of the velocity interval within which a neighbour galaxy is included ( @xmath84 km s@xmath64 ) .",
    "even very accurate photometric redshifts have errors much larger than this velocity interval , errors even much larger than the velocity dispersion of massive galaxy clusters .",
    "photometric redshifts with the currently available accuracy are therefore not useful for the calculation of dynamical properties of structures , such as velocity dispersion and virial mass .",
    "the density estimates are also sensitive to photo - z errors @xcite , although not as much as velocity related quantities .",
    "the use of photo - z s increases the number of interlopers and smears out information along the line of sight .",
    "the comparison between the full and spec - z only sample shows that the relation between colour and @xmath90 changes when galaxies with photo - z s are included : the correlation is still there , but at a lower significance of only @xmath173 ( compared to @xmath246 for spec - z s only ) .",
    "the same is seen for the correlation between colour and @xmath88 : it becomes weaker , but not as much as the colour - density relation .",
    "its significance drops from @xmath161 to @xmath247 .",
    "the intrinsic galaxy properties of colour and stellar mass are not as sensitive to the photo - z errors , since the random errors of the sed fitting and the photometry are already larger than the expected error introduced by using photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "the colour - stellar mass relation is very robust against inclusion of photo - z s .",
    "another issue is the incompleteness in the spectroscopic redshift sample .",
    "this sample is not stellar mass limited at @xmath248 .",
    "the completeness limit is redshift and colour dependent , due to the deep2 @xmath28-band magnitude cut - off at @xmath32 , leading to the loss of faint red galaxies at high @xmath12 .",
    "the correlations between colour , local densities , virial mass and stellar mass should not be affected by this bias however .",
    "the local densities are divided by the median in each @xmath249 redshift slice to account for the redshift dependent completeness limit .",
    "the colour bias could affect the colour - density relation at high @xmath12 if faint red galaxies at that redshift preferred a certain environment .",
    "however , since we do not see a colour - density relation in any stellar mass bin at high @xmath12 and low - mass red galaxies are not very numerous , this possible bias is unlikely to influence the overall colour - density relation .",
    "the colour - halo mass relation , based on the velocity dispersion , should also not be affected , since the velocity dispersion of a group is well sampled without including the complete group population and should not strongly depend on colour or mass of the sampled galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that red galaxy cluster members in the sdss have lower velocity dispersions than blue cluster galaxies , although the difference is marginal , of the order of a few percent .",
    "the colour - stellar mass relation is not influenced by the spectroscopic redshift incompleteness , since in this case we use the complete sample , i.e. , galaxies with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts .",
    "we investigate the correlations between galaxy environment , rest frame colour and stellar mass in a @xmath16-band selected , stellar mass limited sample with a high number of secure spectroscopic redshifts , and additional accurate photometric redshifts from the powir / deep2 surveys .",
    "the sample is complete down to a stellar mass of @xmath179 and up to a redshift of @xmath180 .",
    "different characteristics of ` galaxy environment ' are included in this study , including local galaxy overdensity , number of neighbours within a fixed aperture , their crossing times and mean harmonic radius , as well as their velocity dispersion and virial mass as an indicator of the structures parent dark matter halo mass .",
    "we then use these quantities to disentangle the effects of stellar mass and environment on galaxy colour . in the following",
    "we summarize our most important findings :    1 .",
    "average galaxy colour @xmath51 and the fraction of blue galaxies depends strongly on galaxy stellar mass ( see figures  [ fig8 ] and [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "there is a weak correlation of galaxy colour with local number density ( see figures  [ fig6 ] and [ fig10 ] ) . this correlation becomes weaker with higher redshift and is not detectable at @xmath6 .",
    "there is a weak correlation between stellar mass and local number density , such that higher mass galaxies are preferentially found in higher density environments ( see figure  [ fig9 ] and figure  [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "the stellar mass - density relation also disappears at @xmath6 .",
    "this is due to the fact that relative local densities of the highest mass galaxies are decreasing with higher redshift , and not due to an evolution of stellar mass at the highest local densities ( see figure  [ fig13 ] ) . in other words , at a given ( high ) stellar mass the relative overdensity increases with time , while at a given density the stellar mass of a galaxy does not evolve .",
    "when the sample is split up in different stellar mass bins , the colour - density relation largely disappears in all but the intermediate mass bin ( @xmath250 log  @xmath251 ) .",
    "the colour - stellar mass relation , however , is very strong at all local densities and is independent of local density ( see figure  [ fig10 ] and figure  [ fig11 ] ) . the overall colour - density relation is then powered by the relation between colour and stellar mass , and stellar mass and local density ( see figure  [ fig12 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the colour - density relation is a combination of a strong colour - stellar mass relation and a weak stellar mass - density relation .",
    "colour and local density are still related in intermediate mass galaxies ( @xmath250 log  @xmath251 ) at lower redshifts ( @xmath3 ) , possibly shifting towards higher stellar masses ( @xmath252 log  @xmath253 ) at higher redshifts ( @xmath137 , see figure  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the colour fractions @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the colour evolution with @xmath12 ( figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig8 ] ) suggest that these intermediate mass galaxies are moving onto the red sequence in higher density environments at redshifts of @xmath225 . by that redshift",
    "higher mass galaxies have mostly moved to the red sequence already , although there remains a fraction of blue galaxies of @xmath23 20% at @xmath215 .",
    "low - mass galaxies ( @xmath125 ) show a very high fraction of blue galaxies at all redshifts , with very little dependence on density .",
    "there is no significant correlation of galaxy colour or blue fraction with halo mass ( virial mass ) .",
    "however , we find that in low - mass haloes @xmath52 might decrease with cosmic time , while it stays roughly constant in high - mass haloes ( see figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "apart from an increase of the local density around the most massive galaxies , the local environment of galaxies does not change significantly from @xmath7 to @xmath254 .",
    "however , we do detect a trend for increasing compactness ( smaller harmonic radius @xmath88 ) with decreasing redshift , which is most significant in galaxies with high stellar mass ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "we have not detected a significant correlation between galaxy stellar mass and velocity dispersion or virial mass ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) , which might be partly due to the difficulty of measuring those quantities in galaxy structures with such few members .",
    "most structures are already in place by @xmath6 , and are not growing significantly after that , which might be expected in a universe dominated by a cosmological constant .",
