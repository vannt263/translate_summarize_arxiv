    "predicting the electronic properties of magnetic nanostructures is a challenging task as magnetism often manifests itself as a delicate interplay between spin ordering surface chemistry and finite size effects .",
    "@xcite nanoscale magnetism is at the heart of several proposals for molecular spintronic devices , highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of spin - related phenomena in these systems .",
    "one important and especially subtle example of this behavior is the kondo effect , arising from many - body spin interactions between a magnetic impurity and electrons in a metallic system.@xcite    at low temperatures , the kondo screening of the impurity s magnetic moment creates a sharp resonance at the fermi energy in the local density of states at / near the magnetic impurity , producing a zero - bias anomalous signal in transport experiments that probe the local structure .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has proved to be an outstanding tool to probe signatures of the kondo effect in magnetic adatoms on metallic surfaces .",
    "@xcite more recently , kondo - like signals have been reported in magnetic molecules adsorbed on metallic substrates , @xcite stimulating significant advances on the theory side.@xcite for both single magnetic atoms and magnetic molecules on metallic surfaces , the low - bias conductance measured by stm acquires a characteristic fano lineshape , from which the kondo temperature @xmath0 is usually inferred from fittings to well - known equations.@xcite such expressions , however , do not offer estimates for @xmath0 , and rather treat it as a phenomenological fitting parameter .",
    "in fact , as we discuss below , quantitative estimates of @xmath0 are not trivial to obtain in these systems with current theoretical approaches .    here",
    ", we address this issue by employing a combination of complementary numerical methods to calculate the kondo temperature and the density of states in the kondo regime for complex magnetic molecules using state - of - the - art theories and a minimum of information from experimental data .",
    "our approach relies on a combination of two powerful techniques : the first - principles gw method,@xcite one of the most advanced tools to describe the electronic structure of real materials ; and the numerical renormalization - group ( nrg),@xcite widely regarded as the most reliable numerical method to study kondo correlations .",
    "our main goals are ( i ) to identify the relevant microscopic model and obtain realistic microscopic parameters from the gw molecular electronic structure and ( ii ) to describe the kondo regime in a nonperturbative fashion , with no additional assumptions on the shape of the kondo resonance .",
    "the strength of this merging lies on the complementarity of these techniques .",
    "on the one hand , _ ab initio _ methods face formidable challenges in the kondo regime since the strongly - correlated kondo singlet state emerges at energy scales much smaller than the typical atomic or orbital energies and is beyond typical formulations of exchange and correlation effects .",
    "furthermore , the many - body kondo state is not well captured by perturbative approaches , which sometimes yield infrared divergencies at energy scales of order of @xmath1.@xcite on the other hand , nrg , which fully describes the kondo regime , relies on quantum impurity models to capture the microscopic low - energy features of the full system . in the case of organic complexes containing magnetic atoms",
    ", the presence of molecular states , additional degrees of freedom and charging effects further complicates the task of identifying the relevant low - energy microscopic model leading to the kondo effect .",
    "in fact , the comparatively high kondo temperatures ( @xmath2 ) reported in stm measurements involving porphyrin compounds with a magnetic atom @xcite indicate that extra , molecule- and surface - specific features play an active role in modifying the kondo state . in all , such complexity has hindered attempts to _ predict _ kondo temperature values from first - principle calculations , although recent work in nanocontacts is most promising .",

    "the molecule adsorbed on a cu(111 ) surface undergoes a planar - saddle deformation that reduces symmetry even more and breaks the remaining degeneracy .",

    "we use norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite for the interaction between valence and core electrons , including scalar relativistic effects .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional is calculated using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization.@xcite calculations are done using the parsec code .",

    "electron wavefunctions are set to zero outside a domain enclosing the molecule .",
    "the distance between the domain boundary and any atom is at least @xmath16 , thus removing any unwanted effects arising from the scattering of electrons off the boundary .",
    "the dft results are compatible with previous calculations on tbrpp - co@xcite and similar molecules.@xcite    in order to obtain accurate energies of electronic orbitals , we use the gw method.@xcite this approach is advantageous because it provides very accurate relative positions of localized @xmath17 orbitals _ and _ of more extended @xmath18 orbitals@xcite . more specifically ,",
    "most existing approximations used in dft underestimate the value of the coulomb gap , while the gw method typically yields a better value and predicts molecular orbitals with energy ordering in better agreement with experiments .",
    "the gw method is essentially a perturbative approach based on calculating the electron self - energy by summing only feynman diagrams with low order in the screened coulomb interaction @xmath19 . at lowest order ,",
    "the self - energy is simply @xmath20 , which explains the name of the approximation .",
    "@xmath21 here is the green s function of an effective non - interacting system , such as the kohn - sham ( dft ) system . at the next level of approximation",
    ", vertex corrections are added to the previous equation : @xmath22 .",
    "we use a simplified form of the vertex , built from the dft local density approximation .",
    "more details about the construction of the lda vertex and its impact on the electronic structure of confined nanostructures can be found in refs .   and references therein . after the self - energy is calculated , we diagonalize the quasi - particle eigenvalue equation , @xmath23 \\phi_i({\\bf r } ) + \\int { \\rm d } { \\bf r}^\\prime \\sigma ( { \\bf r } , { \\bf r}^\\prime , e_i ) \\phi_i ( { \\bf r}^\\prime ) = e_i \\phi_i ( { \\bf r } ) \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{eq_qp}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the sum of electron - ion potential ( replaced with a pseudopotential in our calculations ) and electrostatic potential created by electrons .",
    "self - consistency between the green s function and self - energy can be added by replacing @xmath21 with a green s function of the real system : @xcite @xmath25 , and repeating the calculations of self - energy , polarizability , and green s function until self - consistency among these quantities is found .",
    "we do not pursue full self - consistency because it is not clear how the vertex function should be updated during the process .",
    "instead , we perform only one self - consistency cycle and assume that self - consistency is usually obtained after a small number of iterations , if the starting electronic structure is similar enough to the converged electronic structure .",
    "@xcite the results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : densities ] and [ fig : z_int ] were obtained using the @xmath26 orbitals ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq_qp ] ) .    owing to the simplicity of the subsequent anderson model and to the fact that spin transport is dominated by interactions in the vicinity of the central atom , we carry out the gw calculations assuming that electronic screening in tbrpp - co originates predominantly from the surrounding porphyrin molecule , with very small contribution from the central cobalt atom .",
    "following this assumption , we compute the screened coulomb interaction @xmath19 of the non - magnetic molecule tbrpp - ca ( with calcium in the center of the porphyrin ring ) and use it in the calculation of tbrpp - co .",
    "several features of tbrpp - co justify this methodology : ( i ) cobalt @xmath7 orbitals are localized and polarize at an energy much higher than the other valence electrons in the molecule .",
    "this is a direct consequence of spatial localization of those orbitals and of small hybridization between co @xmath7 orbitals and orbitals of the tbrpp compound .",
    "( ii ) co @xmath7 orbitals retain most of their identity ( i.e. , have a high projection on atomic co @xmath7 orbitals ) even when surrounded by the non - magnetic tbrpp structure . from that , we infer that chemical bonds between nitrogen atoms and the central atom are weak .",
    "( iii ) the weight of @xmath7 orbitals in the overall screening of tbrpp - co is small as tbrpp has many more valence electrons than co. moreover , the properties of those electrons ( energy , spatial distribution , electric susceptibility ) are very robust with respect to the type of metallic atom used , as we have checked with dft - gga calculations for compounds of the series tbrpp - m ( m = mn , fe , co , cu , ca ) , which show similar electronic structure and also very similar static susceptibility . for tbrpp - ca , we computed the screened coulomb interaction within the time - dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) , @xcite summing 1875 virtual orbitals .",
    "the energy difference between the highest virtual orbital and the lumo is approximately 28 ev .    as shirley and martin reported,@xcite @xmath27 and @xmath28 orbitals correlate strongly with @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "thus , we built a pseudopotential for co that retains the orbitals @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the valence shell@xcite and used this configuration in all gw calculations . in the calculations of tbrpp - ca ,",
    "we use a grid spacing of @xmath29    fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] depicts the relative position of electronic orbitals of gas phase tbrpp - co , obtained from our first - principles gw calculations .",
    "several orbitals around the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) are strongly localized on the cobalt site and are easily identified with atomic @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "all of them are occupied except for the @xmath9 , which is completely empty , and the @xmath8 , which is populated by one unpaired electron .",
    "the @xmath30 direction is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule .",
    "the intrinsically molecular orbitals ( _ i.e. _ , orbitals with weak @xmath7 character ) are non - magnetic .",
    "the partially occupied orbital @xmath8 gives a net spin of one half , @xmath31 , to the molecule .",
    "this orbital , responsible for spin magnetization , is oriented along the direction perpendicular to the plane of the porphyrin ring , giving a strong coupling with both the surface and the stm tip .",
    "these two features confirm that the @xmath8 orbital is the origin of spin - dependent transport in stm experiments .",
    "we should emphasize the distinctions between the gw results presented in fig.[fig : levels ] and the corresponding calculation within dft - gga ( not shown ) .",
    "the most significant difference between the predictions of dft - gga and gw results are in the energy difference between occupied molecular orbitals and unoccupied molecular orbitals .",
    "this is a manifestation of the  band - gap underestimation \" , which is systematically observed when one compares these two theories . in tbrpp - co",
    ", dft - gga predicts the occupied orbitals to have energies much higher than the gw estimate . as consequence , the homo - lumo gap changes from 2.0 ev ( gw ) to 0.55 ev ( dft - gga )",
    "additionally , the value of the majority - minority splitting in the @xmath8 orbital is @xmath32 ev within dft - gga and @xmath33 ev within gw ( fig .",
    "[ fig : levels]).@xcite    our calculations indicate that , although the @xmath8 orbital is localized around the central atom , it would actually penetrate deep into the surface upon deposition ( see fig.[fig : densities ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the strong anisotropy of the @xmath17 orbital and its orientation perpendicular to the plane of the molecule .",
    "some non - magnetic orbitals around the fermi energy are also extended along the @xmath30 direction .",
    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : densities](a ) shows that the homo-1 ( second highest occupied orbital ) , homo and lumo extend in the out - of - plane direction over a similar range as the @xmath8 orbital , indicating a similar penetration depth into the surface .",

    "the monolayer was modeled as an hexagonal supercell with 81 cu atoms on the @xmath38 plane and @xmath39 separating one monolayer from its neighboring images .",
    "we observe that the system relaxes to a configuration where the molecule - surface hybridization is stronger for levels localized in the bromine rings , whose energies lie well below the fermi level . thus , the relative position of the energy levels involved in the kondo effect ( i.e. , those close to the fermi energy ) remains essentially unchanged once the molecule is adsorbed .",
    "these include the cobalt - like molecular levels and the homo / lumo pair depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : levels ] and [ fig : densities ] , for which the effect of charge transfer is chiefly a uniform shift of the fermi energy of the system ( as the chemical potentials of the molecule and the surface are aligned ) , while the relative energy positions of these molecular states and , most importantly , the net magnetization remains unchanged .",
    "we believe such a robustness of the magnetization arises from the relatively large separation in energy ( @xmath40 ev ) of the cobalt @xmath7 orbitals ( fig .",

    "using information from gw calculations , we construct a microscopic model with realistic parameters for the system and calculate the properties in the kondo regime using nrg . in stm experiments with the stm tip located on top of the cobalt atom , the typical width of the kondo signal corresponds to small surface - tip bias values as compared to the characteristic spacing of electronic levels in the molecule . in this regime ,",
    "electronic transport is dominated by elastic processes at energies close to the fermi energy , @xmath13 .",
    "this low - energy behavior can be captured by a model that includes both the singly - occupied @xmath8 level as well as a molecular orbital @xmath44 with a strong projection along the @xmath30 direction at the central position , and with energy closest to @xmath13 ( i.e. , the homo in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels]).@xcite    the hamiltonian for such an anderson - like model is written as : @xmath45 the first term describes the molecular levels involved in transport .",
    "for the description of the kondo regime , the geometry of the molecule+surface+tip configuration favors orbitals with strong @xmath30 projections which are either singly occupied ( giving the molecule an effective magnetic moment ) or with an energy relatively close to the fermi level ( contributing to electronic transport ) .",

    ", as follows .",
    "we consider two main contributions to the molecular level linewidths : an intrinsic broadening @xmath64 ( arising from electronic scattering processes within the molecule and obtained directly from the gw calculations ) and a contribution @xmath65 from the hybridization with both surface and bulk metallic states ( described by @xmath66 in eq.([eq : couplings ] ) ) .",
    "the key approximation involves writing @xmath67 , @xcite where the surface contribution @xmath65 is directly related to the hybridization matrix elements : @xmath68 in general , @xmath65 will depend on the details of the overlap integrals @xmath69 , particularly on the distance between molecule and surface . while such calculations are possible for single atoms,@xcite they are numerically very demanding for a molecule such as tbrpp - co .    instead , we take the following approach : we assume that the relevant important metallic ( bulk and surface ) states leading to the kondo effect have long wavelengths so that the surface can be replaced with an electron gas occupying the half - space @xmath70 .",

    "we write the hamiltonian given in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) as a single - channel anderson impurity model with an energy - dependent hybridization function@xcite that includes the information on the molecular orbitals .",
    "we used a nrg discretization parameter @xmath80 and kept up to 1000 states ( not including su(2 ) spin degeneracy ) on each iteration ; we use a wide - band approximation , which assumes @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the bandwidth of the continuum of metallic states ( which includes contributions from both surface and bulk states ) . to check this assumption ,",

    "we find that our _ ab initio _ treatment beyond dft is essential , as the contribution from dynamical correlations to the molecule parameters ( e.g. , @xmath50 , orbital energies and hybridizations ) are important .",
    "our first - principles gw calculations indicate that there are two kinds of orbitals in the vicinity of the fermi energy with a strong overlap with the surface : a spin - polarized @xmath8 orbital , which gives rise to the kondo effect , and non - polarized molecular orbitals .",

    "we find , not unexpectedly , that the kondo temperature and the dos features depend strongly on the interplay between two parameters : the position of the partially occupied spin - polarized orbital with respect to the fermi energy , which increases @xmath0 as it approaches that energy , and the wave function overlap between molecular orbitals and surface states , which decreases @xmath0 as it reduces ( increasing @xmath34 ) .",

    "the strength of @xmath50 depends crucially on the total magnetization of the molecule ( tbrpp - mn , for instance , has values of @xmath50 several evs larger than tbrpp - co ) and on the strength of the tbrpp molecular field .",
