    "this difference just comes from the definition of coupling constant @xmath110  @xcite .",

    "the mixing of the currents @xmath72 and @xmath73 does not improve the rate of the pole contribution .",
    "the small pole contribution suggests that the continuum contribution to the spectral density is dominant , which demands a very careful choice of the parameters of the qcd sum rule . in our numerical analysis , we require the extracted mass have a dual minimum dependence on both the borel parameter @xmath90 and the threshold parameter @xmath86 . in this way",

    "we have performed the qcd sum rule analysis for both @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the obtained results are quite similar .",
    "this is due to the similarity of the two correlation functions as shown in eq .",

    "we have also considered their mixing , which also give the similar result .",
    "the mass is predicted to be around @xmath133 gev in the qcd sum rule .",
    "in this section , we use the method of finite energy sum rule ( fesr ) . in order to calculate the mass in the fesr , we first define the @xmath134th moment by using the spectral function @xmath120 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) @xmath135 this integral is used for the phenomenological side , while the integral along the circular contour of radius @xmath86 on the @xmath136 complex plain should be performed for the theoretical side .",

    "( [ eq : moment ] ) for @xmath145 , or they have a very small contribution for @xmath146 , when the theoretical side is computed by the integral over the circle of radius @xmath86 on the complex @xmath136 plain",
    ". therefore , the spectral densities for @xmath72 and @xmath73 take the following form up to dimension 10 , @xmath147    the mass is shown as a function of the threshold value @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fesr ] , where @xmath134 is chosen to be 1 .",
    "we find that there is a mass minimum .",
    "it is around 2.3 gev for the current @xmath72 when we take @xmath148 gev@xmath115 , while it is around 2.2 gev for the current @xmath73 when we take @xmath149 gev@xmath115 . for the current @xmath72 ,",
    "the minimum point occurs at @xmath150 gev where the mass takes 2.3 gev , and the threshold value is slightly smaller than the mass , unlike the ordinary expectation that @xmath151 is larger than the obtained mass .",
    "however , the minimum point is on the very shallow minimum curve and the resulting mass is rather insensitive to the change in the @xmath151 value .",
    "therefore , we can increase @xmath151 slightly more , for example 2.45 gev , but the mass still remains at around @xmath152 gev , which is smaller than @xmath151 now .",
    "this fact is due to the uncertainty of our sum rule analysis as well as the negative part of the spectral densities .",

    "we show the second case in fig .",
    "[ fig : fesr_correct ] . the region @xmath154 gev@xmath115 is suitable for the qcd sum rule analysis , and the mass obtained is around 2.2 gev .",
    "therefore , considering the uncertainty of the qcd sum rule , we obtain the same result as the previous one .",
    "in this work we have studied the mass of the state @xmath0 with the quantum numbers @xmath1 in the qcd sum rule .",
    "we have constructed both the diquark - antidiquark currents @xmath155 and the meson - meson currents @xmath49 .",
    "we find that there are two independent currents for both cases and verify the relations between them .",
    "then using the two @xmath2 currents , we calculate the ope up to dimension twelve , which contains the @xmath156 condensates .",
    "the convergence of the ope turns our to be very good .",
    "we find that the ope s of the two currents are similar , and therefore , the obtained results are also similar . by using both the svz sum rule and the finite energy sum rule , we find that there is a mass minimum . for svz sum rule ,",

    "the minimum is in the region @xmath159 gev@xmath115 .",
    "considering the uncertainty , the mass obtained is around @xmath160 gev .",
    "the state @xmath0 can be accommodated in the qcd sum rule formalism although the central value of the mass is about 100 mev higher than the experimental value .",
    "we calculate the ope up to dimension twelve and include many terms , but still the accuracy is around 20% .",
    "this is the usual accuracy of the qcd sum rule . in our analysis",
    "it is partly due to the many omitted condensates such as @xmath161 etc .",
    "we have investigated the coupling of the currents to the lower lying states including @xmath5 and found that the relevant spectral density becomes negative , implying that the present four - quark currents can not describe those states properly .",
    "this fact indicates that the four - quark interpolating currents couple rather weakly to @xmath5 , which is a pure @xmath118 state .    we can test the tetraquark structure of @xmath0 by considering its decay properties .",
    "naively , the @xmath55 tetraquark would fall apart via @xmath162-wave into the @xmath163 pair , and would have a very large width .",
    "the experimental width of @xmath0 is only about @xmath164 mev , which seems too narrow to be a pure tetraquark state .",
    "we can discuss the decay of the @xmath0 by borrowing an argument based on a valence quark picture .",
    "the @xmath165 configuration for @xmath0 can be a combination of @xmath166 and @xmath167 , which may fall apart into two mesons of @xmath168 and @xmath169 in the @xmath170-wave . in the qcd sum rule the @xmath168 @xmath69 meson",
    "is well identified with @xmath5 , while the @xmath169 @xmath171 meson has a mass around @xmath172 gev and is hard to be identified with the observed @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , such a fall - apart decay would simply be suppressed due to the kinematical reason .",
    "the physical @xmath56 state may be a tetraquark state as discussed in the previous qcd sum rule study  @xcite .",
    "then the transition @xmath173 should be accompanied by a @xmath53 creation violating the ozi rule , as well as by an annihilation of one quanta of orbital angular momentum .",
    "these facts may once again suppress the decay of @xmath174 .",
    "this fact was studied in the recent paper by torres , khemchandani , geng , napsuciale and oset  @xcite .",
    "they studied the @xmath175 system with the faddeev equations where the contained @xmath176 form the @xmath56 resonance .",
    "the decay width they calculated is around @xmath177 mev , not far from the experimental value .",
    "the all above evidences would imply that the @xmath0 is a possible candidate of a tetraquark state .",
    "@xmath0 could be a threshold effect , a hybrid state @xmath178 , a tetraquark , an excited @xmath118 state or a mixture of all the above possibilities .",
    "because of its non - exotic quantum number , it is not easy to establish its underlying structure . clearly more experimental and theoretical investigations are required .",
    "one byproduct of the present work is the interesting observation that some type of four - quark interpolating currents may couple weakly to the conventional @xmath179 ground states .",
    "if future work confirms this point , we may have a novel framework to study the excited @xmath179 mesons using the four - quark interpolating currents , which is not feasible for the traditional @xmath179 interpolating currents .",
