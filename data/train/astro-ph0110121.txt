    "recombination lines of carbon originate either in regions adjacent to  regions ( classical  regions ) or in neutral components (  or molecular ) of the interstellar medium ( diffuse  regions ) .",
    "the diffuse  regions are identified through observations of carbon rls in absorption at frequencies below @xmath3 100 mhz and in emission above @xmath3 150 mhz @xcite . this paper concerns new extensive observations of the diffuse  regions in carbon rls at frequencies near 327 mhz .",
    "rl observations were made in the longitude range @xmath4 332@xmath1 89 , using the ort in two different angular resolutions ",
    "2@xmath5 2  and 2@xmath5 6@xcite . in the low resolution survey ,",
    "carbon rls were detected at almost all the positions in the longitude range @xmath0 0  to 20  and at a few positions between @xmath0 20  to 89 .",
    "the  diagram and the radial distribution , obtained from carbon rl emission near 327 mhz , show similarity with those obtained from hydrogen rls observed near 3 cm from  regions and `` intense ''  emission .",
    "this similarity indicates that the distribution of the diffuse  regions in the inner galaxy is similar to that of the spiral arm components .",
    "towards several positions in the inner galaxy , the central velocities of the observed ( 2  @xmath5 2  resolution ) carbon rls coincide with known  self - absorption features .",
    "self - absorption is observed when a cool ( @xmath3 20 k ) cloud appears in absorption against  emission from warmer gas behind it .",
    "the similarity of the central velocities suggests that the diffuse  regions in these directions coexist with the cool  clouds .",
    "the observed widths ( @xmath3 4 ) of the hi self - absorption features are , however , much narrower than the typical widths ( @xmath3 15 ) of the carbon rls . the difference in line widths may be due to : ( 1 ) there may be several cool  clouds with slightly different central velocities within the 2@xmath5 2  beam and most of them may produce carbon lines , which results in a broader rl .",
    "however , the  observations will detect only the coldest hi clouds and hence the line will have a narrow line width .",
    "( 2 ) alternatively , if `` warmer '' ( @xmath3 100 k ) , presumably more turbulent  gas is associated with cool  clouds then both `` warm '' and `` cool '' gas will emit carbon rls but only the cool  component will be observed in self - absorption ."
