    "the properties of the quark cooper pairs will be modified .",
    "in particular , we expect their size to become of the same order as the interparticle distance , @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , it was argued that , due to the strong coupling , the fluctuations of the diquark - pair field become large around the critical temperature @xmath8 @xcite and that they give rise to a pseudogap region in the normal phase above @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if the quark - quark interaction becomes strong enough before the quarks are confined at lower density , quark cooper pairs become small enough to be considered as diquark molecules which are tightly bound states of two quarks .",
    "the color - superconducting ground state of quark matter at low temperature turns into a bose - einstein condensed phase of diquark molecules @xcite .",
    "most likely , the transition happens continuously with the change of the density , just like the bcs - bec crossover in conventional condensed matter systems @xcite , see also refs .",
    "an interesting property of diquark molecules is that they can exist even above the critical temperature @xmath8 of bec , up to the dissociation temperature @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if such modes exist in quark matter , they will affect its properties and experimental observables .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the appearance of diquark molecules and their bec in the phase diagram of quark matter using a low - energy effective model .",
    "this model features an attractive quark - quark interaction with a constant coupling strength @xmath10 that is regarded as a free parameter of the model .",

    "@xmath8 , the strongest decay mode of diquarks is that into two quarks . since the excitation energy of a quark at rest is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the mass of the quark , the threshold energy for this decay process is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the average mass and chemical potential of the quarks in the diquark . recalling that the energy of the diquark excitations should be positive to ensure the stability of the system",

    "one thus expects that diquarks including a strange quark are more stable than those composed of up and down quarks .",
    "usually , bec is discussed using the canonical ensemble , i.e. , the particle number density is fixed as an external parameter . in this work , however , we employ the grand canonical ensemble and draw the phase diagram in the @xmath2 plane , as is usually done in the literature when exploring the qcd phase diagram @xcite . in order to decide whether bec of diquarks occurs in this ensemble , we regard the region of the superconducting phase satisfying eq .",

    "quark matter in compact stars , this is probably not a very good assumption , as the chemical potentials should be determined to satisfy the neutrality and beta - equilibrium conditions . it is known that a rich phase structure can appear under these conditions @xcite .",
    "however , as we shall see in the following , diquark excitations play an important role even at high temperatures and small chemical potentials in the range relevant for heavy - ion collisions . in this case , our assumption of equal chemical potentials for all quark flavors and colors is applicable to very good approximation .",
    "this statement warrants a few remarks .",
    "thermal model fits of hadron yields at chemical freeze - out show that , because of strangeness and isospin conservation , neither the strangeness chemical potential @xmath19 nor the isospin chemical potential @xmath20 are zero .",
    "the strangeness chemical potential is nonzero because of associated production channels in hadronic matter at nonzero baryon chemical potential . for quark matter , however , @xmath19 should be strictly zero if the system has zero strangeness , and we may neglect @xmath19 .",
