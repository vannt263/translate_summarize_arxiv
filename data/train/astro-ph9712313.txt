    "the exciting discovery of the planetary companion to 51 peg ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) marked a breakthrough in the search for extra - solar planets .",
    "after years of unfruitful searches , precise radial velocity ( rv ) surveys have uncovered several extra - solar planets since the 51 peg discovery ( butler et al .",
    "1997 ; cochran et al . 1997 ; noyes et al . 1997 ; butler & marcy 1996 ) .",
    "one of the more unexpected results of these surveys is the fact that giant , jovian - mass planets can exist in very short - period orbits around solar - type stars .",
    "although first received with skepticism ( primarily because it was so unexpected ) , planet formation theories can now provide a natural explanation for the occurrence of these peculiar systems ( boss 1995 ; lissauer 1995 ; lin et al .",
    "these systems , termed the  51-peg systems \" by butler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are characterized by planets with masses in the range of 0.5 - 4 @xmath7 and orbital periods of 3.314 days ( 0.05  0.1 au ) .",
    "members of this class include 51 peg , @xmath0 boo , @xmath8 cnc , and @xmath9 and .",
    "because rv measurements provide only an indirect means of detecting a planetary companion , one can never be absolutely certain that the rv signal is due to the reflex motion of the star .",
    "after all , pulsations , both radial and nonradial , as well as stellar surface structure can also produce rv variations which would mimic the signal caused by a planetary companion .",
    "it is for these reasons that ancillary measurements are needed to confirm all planetary discoveries made by rv measurements .",
    "photometric measurements of many of the 51 peg - like stars have established a constant light level to a limit of 0.4 mmag ( baliunas et al .",
    "these results provide strong support to the hypothesis that these are indeed planetary companions to the 51 peg - like stars .    recent work , however , has questioned whether a planet actually exists around the prototypical system , 51 pegasi . in a controversial paper , gray ( 1997 ) reported changes in the spectral line shapes ( as measured by the spectral line bisector ) of the fe i 6253  line with the same period as the rv variations in this star .",
    "gray & hatzes ( 1997 ) showed that both the changes in the line shapes and the rv variations for 51 peg could be modeled by nonradial pulsations without the need to invoke a planet .",
    "furthermore , the nonradial mode would have to be a g - mode oscillation which means that most of the atmospheric motion is in the horizontal direction .",
    "since these produce small distortions in the projected area of the star , the expected photometric amplitude would be well below detection levels .",
    "however , the spectral variability for 51 peg was recently refuted by hatzes , cochran , & bakker ( 1998 ) using higher quality data ; this star most likely has a planet .",
    "even though the dispute over the planet of 51 pegasi has been resolved , it is still worthwhile to confirm the other short - period extra - solar planet discoveries and a detailed examination of the spectral line shapes may provide the most stringent test for such a confirmation .    with a semi - amplitude of 469 and a period of 3.3 days the `` planet '' around @xmath0 boo",
    "is the most massive of the 51-peg systems ( @xmath3 sin @xmath10 = 3.7 @xmath11 ) .",
    "ca ii h and k measurements imply a rotation period of 3.4  4 days for the central star ( baliunas , sokolof , & soon 1996 ; baliunas et al .",
    "1997 ) , so there is some concern that the rv period may be due to rotational modulation .",
    "however , the low upper limit ( @xmath12 1 mmag ) to any photometric variability of this star argues against surface structure and possibly pulsations as a cause for the rv variations ( baliunas et al .",
    "there should also be a concern that this star is a nonradial pulsator .",
    "baade & kjeldsen ( 1997 ) found evidence for line profile variations in the star @xmath13 ara that were indicative of an m @xmath14 4 mode .",
    "the spectral type of @xmath13 ara , f6v , is uncomfortably close to that of @xmath0 boo ( f7v ) .",
    "the rv amplitude for @xmath0 boo , however , is so large that if it was due to nonradial pulsations then changes in spectral line shapes would be large and readily measurable . in this paper",
    "we analyze the spectral line shapes of @xmath0 boo in an effort to confirm or deny the planet hypothesis for this star .",
    "data were acquired using the 2-d coud spectrograph ( tull et al .",
    "1995 ) of the mcdonald observatory s 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope .",
    "this instrument is a cross - dispersed echelle spectrometer used with a tektronix 2048@xmath152048 ccd detector ( 24 @xmath16 m pixels ) and it can be operated in a `` low '' resolution ( @xmath17 @xmath14 60,000 ) focus with nearly complete wavelength coverage in the range 4000  ",
    "1 @xmath16 m , or in a `` high '' resolution focus with more limited and non - contiguous wavelength coverage ( @xmath2 400  ) .",
    "the detector was placed at the high resolution ( f1 ) focus for this study .",
    "a projected slit width of 2.4 pixels at the detector resulted in a working resolving power of 240,000 ( resolution = 0.026  ) .    shortly after commissioning of the 2-d coud we noticed that when using instrument in its high resolution mode the theoretical resolving power could not be achieved .",
    "furthermore , this limiting resolution seemed to degrade with time .",
    "tests with a pinhole aperture produced two images at the camera focus .",
    "most of the time these images fell on a line perpendicular to the dispersion which should not affect the instrumental profile ( ip ) when co - adding all ccd rows contained in a spectral order .",
    "however , there were instances when these two images were not aligned precisely perpendicular to the dispersion , and this would degrade the ip .",
    "further tests showed that by masking the top half of the spectrograph collimator we could isolate the one pinhole image which remained fixed with time .",
    "this also enabled us to recover the full resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "work is in progress to isolate and rectify the problem ( it is suspected that this effect is due to stresses imposed on the cross - dispersing prisms in their mount ) .",
    "all observations were made with the top half of the collimator masked .",
    "this is an investigation of subtle changes in the spectral line shapes which could be affected by changes in the ip .",
    "consequently , we chose to sacrifice photons at the expense of a stable ip .",
    "an examination of the thorium emission lines taken on the nights showed that the rms scatter of the full width to half maximum ( fwhm ) varied by no more than 10% ( 0.002  ) from observing run to run . considering that the fwhm of the spectral lines of @xmath0 boo is about 0.5 ",
    "such a small ip variability should not affect the spectral line shapes .",
    "table 1 lists the journal of observations which include julian day of the mid - exposure , exposure time , and rv phase .",
    "phases were computed according to the orbital ephemeris of butler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the phase of maximum radial velocity .",
    "spectral line bisectors , which consist of the locus of midpoints to horizontal line segments extending across the profile , provide sensitive measures of changes in the line shapes caused both by surface features ( toner & gray 1988 ) or nonradial pulsations ( hatzes 1996 ; gray & hatzes 1997 )",
    ". however , these types of measurements are less effective for stars with rapid rotation since the decreased slope and depths of the lines greatly increase the error of the bisector measurement .",
    "also , rapid rotation increases the likelihood for line blending . with a rotational velocity of 15 @xmath0 boo",
    "is a less than ideal candidate for bisector measurements .",
    "even so , an attempt was made to search for changes in the spectral line shapes using line bisectors .    for a spectral line to be a suitable candidate for bisector measurements",
    "it must be relatively strong and blend - free .",
    "the rapid rotation of @xmath0 boo obviously works against these criteria . in the spectral region covered by our observations",
    "there were only three lines suitable for bisector measurements .",
    "these are listed in table 2 .",
    "prior to computing the individual line bisector the spectra were smoothed with a gaussian having a full width at half maximum of 4 pixels .",
    "( due to the broad lines in @xmath0 boo we could afford to increase the overall signal - to - noise ratio at the expense of degraded resolution . )",
    "individual bisectors ( 24 ) from a given night were co - added to produce a nightly mean . figures  [ bisect1 ] and  [ bisect2 ] shows the line bisector variations for the fe i 6213 and ca i 6439  .",
    "( the line bisectors of fe i 6337  show comparable variations , or lack thereof , and are not shown .",
    "the velocity span measurements for this line , however , will be used in  3.3 ) .",
    "error bars are shown only for the bisector at phase 0.75 and these represent a typical value for the measurements .",
    "these were estimated using the noise level as measured in the continuum and the slope of the flux profiles ( gray 1988 ) .",
    "there appear to be no systematic variations with phase for the bisectors that is above the noise level . in ",
    "3.3 we quantify the possible changes in the bisector slopes .",
    "because of the line broadening in @xmath0 boo , spectral line bisectors may not be the best way to search for spectral variability in this star .",
    "the rapid rotation , on the other hand , may enable us to see directly the distortions in the spectral line profiles due to pulsations .",
    "it is well known that for stars with rapid rotation both nonradial pulsations and surface structure produce distortions that propagate through the spectral line profile .",
    "these are best seen in stars rotating at @xmath6 25 , but should still be visible in spectral line profiles with the same broadening as @xmath0 boo . a convenient means of measuring",
    "the amplitude of these distortions is through the line residuals ( e.g. kennelly et al .",
    "1992 ; baade & kjedsen 1997 ) .",
    "line residuals were computed by first co - adding all observations to produce a grand mean .",
    "prior to adding the spectra they were all aligned to the rest frame of the star .",
    "( again , all observations were smoothed by a 4-pixel gaussian prior to computing line residuals . )",
    "observations on a given night were than combined to produce a nightly mean .",
    "( the signal - to - noise ratio of these nightly means was @xmath2 400 per pixel . )",
    "the line residuals were taken as the difference between the nightly means and the grand mean .",
    "table 3 lists the spectral lines that were used to search for residual variations .",
    "figure  [ resids1 ] and figure  [ resids2 ] are representative residuals for the four spectral lines in the wavelength interval 6108   6117 and the fe i line 6224  .",
    "there appears to be no phase - dependent distortions across the spectral line profile and any distortions which may be present are at the level of the noise ( as indicated by the scatter of the residuals in the continuum ) .      at the present time",
    ", nonradial pulsations seems to be the only hypothesis , other than a planetary companion , that may provide an explanation for the rv variability of @xmath0 boo . even though the estimated rotational period for @xmath0 boo is near that of the rv period ,",
    "surface features ( spots , etc ) can be excluded as a possible hypothesis not only on the basis of the lack of photometric variations , but also from the lack of spectral distortions as evidenced in our bisector and line residual measurements .",
    "it is difficult for any surface feature to account for the large rv amplitude in @xmath0 boo without producing measurable changes in the line shapes .",
    "it is possible , however , for nonradial pulsations to produce significant rv variability without large variations in the spectral line shapes ( hatzes 1996 ) .",
    "the question is , whether these can produce the large rv amplitude seen in @xmath0 boo without measurable line distortions . in this section",
    "we place limits on any possible nonradial pulsation mode which may be present on @xmath0 boo .",
    "we considered all sectoral nonradial modes that were capable of producing the observed rv amplitude .",
    "furthermore , the shapes of the rv curves from nonradial pulsations are nearly sinusoidal , consistent with the nearly zero orbital eccentricity",
    ".    the expected line bisector and line residual variations from nonradial pulsations were calculated using the prescription outlined in hatzes ( 1996 ) .",
    "nonradial pulsations can be described in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the degree and @xmath3 the azimuthal order .",
    "only sectoral modes ( @xmath21 = @xmath3 ) were considered as these should produce the largest integrated rv amplitude . the pulsational amplitude for each mode",
    "was chosen such that the integrated rv amplitude from the oscillations was 469 , i.e. the observed rv amplitude in @xmath0 boo .    in calculating the local velocity field on the stellar surface due to",
    "nonradial pulsations one needs to know the ratio of the horizontal to vertical velocity amplitudes of the atmospheric motions .",
    "normally this is not a free parameter , but can be calculated by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the pulsation constant = @xmath24 .",
    "( @xmath25 is the pulsation period in days , @xmath26 is the mean density of the star , and @xmath27 is the mean density of the sun ) . for @xmath0 boo",
    "the appropriate value of k is @xmath14 1000 .",
    "however , there is a well know `` k - parameter problem '' where in modeling the line profile variations of known nonradial pulsators , the profiles can be better fit with low values of @xmath5 ( @xmath14 0 ) even though the pulsation period implies the need for much larger values of @xmath5 ( lee & saio 1990 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath5 was treated as a free parameter .    a convenient means of quantifying a line bisector is through its velocity span .",
    "due to the large errors in the bisector data we chose to measure this velocity span using a linear regression of all bisector points within two arbitrarily chosen flux points . as can be seen from figs .",
    "1 and 2 measuring the span using only two bisector points can result in grossly different velocity span measurements depending on which end points are chosen .",
    "the slope of the linear regression through all bisector points is less sensitive to the choice of end points .",
    "comparisons of this span to those predicted by nonradial pulsations were done in a consistent manner , i.e. the bisector from a synthetic spectral line profile having nonradial pulsations was computed and the velocity span was calculated using a linear regression through all bisector points within the specified flux values used in the data bisectors .",
    "the synthetic data , like the real data , were also smoothed by a gaussian having a fwhm of 4 pixels .",
    "figures  [ span1 ]  [ span3 ] show the bisector velocity span measurements for the fe  i  6213  , fe  i  6337  , and the ca  i  6439  lines , respectively .",
    "the averaged velocity span measurements are tabulated in table  [ spantable ] .",
    "the error was estimated by taking the standard deviation , @xmath28 , of the individual span measurements clustered around phase 0.45 .",
    "this @xmath29 was plotted as the error on each of the data points .",
    "superimposed on these figures are the predicted velocity span variations from nonradial modes having @xmath5=10 , @xmath3=1,2 and @xmath5=1.2 ( a canonical value for g - mode oscillations ) , @xmath3=1,2 .",
    "use of the predicted @xmath5 value ( @xmath5 @xmath2 1000 ) for @xmath0 boo resulted in span variations much larger than those shown in the figures .",
    "this was also true for sectoral modes with @xmath3 @xmath6 2 , regardless of the @xmath5-value .",
    "we can thus exclude those pulsation modes with @xmath3 @xmath6 2 and all modes with @xmath5 @xmath30 10 . only the @xmath3 = 1 with @xmath5 = 1.2 would produce bisector span variations which would be hidden by the noise in our data .",
    "the presence of an @xmath3 = 2 , @xmath5 = 1.2 mode is marginally possible and , in fact , the fe i 6213  bisector spans do show a hint of sinusoidal variations with an amplitude comparable to that expected for an @xmath3 = 2 ( albeit out - of - phase ) .",
    "however , we deem this to be merely noise as there are no obvious sinusoidal variations in the span measurements for the other two lines .    even though the phased bisector velocity span measurements show , for the most part , no obvious sinusoidal variations",
    ", a periodogram analysis was still performed these measurements ( table  [ spantable ] ) .",
    "there was no statistically significant power at the rv period of 3.31 days in any of the periodograms .",
    "the false alarm probability for any power at the rv period was 0.4 for the ca i 6439  line and 0.2 for the fe i 6337  line .",
    "power did appear near the appropriate frequency in the periodogram for the fe i 6213  span measurements with a moderately low false alarm probability of 0.02 .",
    "again , we do not deem this significant based on the lack of power at the appropriate period in the other periodograms .",
    "( we should point out that the best line for bisector measurements , the ca i 6439  , showed the highest false alarm probability . )",
    "nonradial pulsations should also be visible in the spectral line residuals .",
    "figure  [ nrpres ] shows the percent change in the model spectral line residuals for an @xmath3=2 , @xmath5=10 mode .",
    "the distortions have an amplitude of a few percent , much larger than the observed distortions in figure  [ resids1 ] and [ resids2 ] .",
    "( the amplitude of the distortions for the @xmath3 = 1 , @xmath5 = 1.2 mode are about 0.5% . )",
    "figure  [ sigma ] shows the standard deviation of the predicted spectral line residuals for various pulsation modes as a function of rv phase .",
    "the standard deviation was computed over the full width of the spectral line .",
    "the crosses represent the standard deviation of the line residuals of the actual data , again computed over the full width of the spectral line .",
    "individual measurements are shown as crosses while the solid dots represent a mean value for all seven spectral lines that were examined .",
    "part ( if not all ) of the rms scatter that was computed for the real data may be due to photon noise .",
    "in order to correct for this , the @xmath28 over an equivalent wavelength region in the continuum was calculated and subtracted in quadrature from the @xmath28 computed across the spectral line .",
    "it is not strictly correct to subtract the @xmath28 in the continuum since the signal - to - noise ratio in the spectral line decreases from the continuum value .",
    "for line depths of 1015% and @xmath1 @xmath2 150 , this effect should result in a value @xmath28 @xmath14 0.0015 for the residuals across the line profile .",
    "this is comparable to the mean level of @xmath28 for the line residuals as seen in figure  [ sigma ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the non - zero mean @xmath28 for the line residuals can be explained entirely by noise and is not due to intrinsic variability of the star .    in comparing the variation of @xmath28 for the line residuals with the pulsation models we can once again exclude all pulsations modes with @xmath3 @xmath4 and those with @xmath5 @xmath30 10",
    ". of the modes having the smaller horizontal scaler , only an @xmath3 = 1 is consistent with the apparent lack of line shape variations .",
    "an @xmath3 = 2 can be hidden in the residual variations for an individual line , but it seems to be excluded when using the residual variations averaged over all lines .",
    "our analysis of the spectral line shapes of @xmath0 boo , both through line bisectors and line residuals , indicate no variability above the noise of the measurements .",
    "this lack of spectral variability is consistent with recent findings for this star by brown et al .",
    "if @xmath0 boo is really a pulsating star , then the only pulsation mode it could possibly have is an @xmath3 = 1 , but with a low horizontal scaler ( @xmath5 @xmath2 1 ) , a value several orders of magnitude less than the predicted value .",
    "this mode and possibly an @xmath3 = 2 ( although less likely ) could account for the observed rv variations in this star and yet show no measurable changes in the spectral line shapes .",
    "one would think that these modes could be excluded on the basis of the low @xmath5 values , but this may not be the case in light of the @xmath5-parameter problem discussed earlier .",
    "a calculation of pulsations in a real stellar atmosphere along with the temperature variations may result in a much lower `` observed '' @xmath5-value .",
    "if the low @xmath5 values implied by this study do indeed represent a true ratio of the horizontal to vertical velocities , then the pulsational amplitude can be used to estimate the photometric amplitude for the oscillations . for both the @xmath3 = 1 and @xmath3 = 2 modes ( @xmath5 = 1.2 ) the pulsational amplitude is about 400 .",
    "buta & smith ( 1979 ) published expressions for estimating the photometric amplitude due to geometrical effects . these result in @xmath31v @xmath2 0.03 mag for the @xmath3 = 2 mode and @xmath31v @xmath2 0 mag for the @xmath3 = 1 mode .",
    "there may , of course , also be photometric variations due to temperature effects and for very long periods these may dominate the light curve ( buta & smith 1979 ) .",
    "the temperature variations can be estimated using @xmath32 is the adiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath33 is the rotational frequency , @xmath34 is the pulsational frequency , @xmath35 is the pulsational amplitude and @xmath36 is the rotational velocity ( lee & saio 1990 ) . for @xmath0",
    "boo , @xmath34 @xmath2 @xmath33 , @xmath35 = 0.4 , and @xmath36 = 15 . for the @xmath3 (= @xmath21 ) = 1 mode @xmath37 t @xmath2 170 k , and for the @xmath3 = 2 mode @xmath37 t @xmath2 300 k. these variations result in @xmath31@xmath38 @xmath2 0.1 and 0.2 mag , respectively , for the two modes , assuming that these temperature changes represent disk integrated quantities .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption given the low degree of the modes .",
    "the lack of photometric variations seems to exclude such large temperature variations .",
    "however , as pointed out by buta & smith , the temperature variations for very long period modes ( i.e. much greater than the period of the fundamental radial mode ) are difficult to calculate and these may have to include both non - adiabatic and non - linear effects .",
    "consequently , these approximate estimates , derived from linear theory , may not be appropriate for the hypothetical pulsation mode in @xmath0 boo .",
    "furthermore , buta & smith state that the light curve from temperature variations may be in - phase or out - of - phase with that due to the geometric variations .",
    "one could imagine a scheme where the geometric variations nearly cancel those due to temperature variations producing a net zero change in the light level .",
    "these may also conspire to produce small changes in the spectral line shapes , even if @xmath5 is large .",
    "clearly , a detailed analysis of pulsations in a stellar atmosphere is required to obtain better estimates of any predicted light curve . at face value , however , the photometry does seem to exclude the possibility of such low degree nonradial modes .    of course there is no reason to expect that the hypothetical pulsation modes are spheroidal in nature .",
    "one possibility is toroidal , or r - modes ( saio 1982 ) . because the atmospheric motions for these modes are purely horizontal , they should not be accompanied by photometric variations .",
    "it is not clear , however , if these modes could produce appreciable rv variations . for a star with intermediate inclination r - modes can produce spectral line distortions ( unno et al .",
    "1989 ) , but these are not seen in our spectral data .",
    "astrophysics , more than most sciences , has its level of uncertainty .",
    "this is primarily because the objects of our study are distant and can not be scrutinized in laboratories , or up - close in exquisite detail .",
    "the best we can do is collect high quality data and draw the `` most probable '' hypothesis that is consistent with that data .",
    "there will always be some probability , no matter how small , that the conclusions that are drawn are incorrect due to our ignorance of certain aspects of natural phenomena .",
    "this is especially true for extra - solar planet discoveries made with rv measurements since these are indirect detections and some unknown process may be the cause of any observed variability .",
    "one thing is certain , if we had found spectral variability in the line shapes of @xmath0 boo with the rv period , then this would almost certainly have killed the planet hypothesis . although our analysis shows no spectral variability in @xmath0 boo it does not prove beyond any doubt that this star has a planetary companion . however , our measurements certainly add to the considerable evidence weighing in favor of the planet hypothesis .",
    "it is still the simplest and most likely explanation for the rv variability in this star .    of the 5 short - period extra - solar planets , two",
    "have been confirmed using analyses of the spectral line shapes .",
    "although it seems highly likely that all the short - period systems have planets , it is still worthwhile to search for any spectral variability in these other stars .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining high resolution measurements for the other short - period planets in order to confirm the planet hypotheses for these stars .",

    "<S> an analysis is made of the spectral line shapes of @xmath0 bootis using high resolution ( 0.026  ) and high signal - to - noise ( @xmath1 @xmath2 400 ) data in an effort to confirm the planet hypothesis for this star . </S>",
    "<S> changes in the line shape are quantified using spectral line bisectors and line residuals . </S>",
    "<S> we detect no variations in either of these quantities above the level of the noise in the data . one spectral line , fe i 6213  , </S>",
    "<S> does show a hint of sinusoidal variations in the bisector velocity span when phased to the radial velocity period of 3.3 days , but this is not seen in the bisectors for two other lines , nor in the line residuals . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons of the data to the bisector and residual variations expected for nonradial pulsations indicate that we can exclude those sectoral nonradial modes having @xmath3 @xmath4 and all sectoral modes with @xmath5 @xmath6 1 , where @xmath5 is the ratio of the horizontal to vertical velocities for the pulsations . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of line shape variability and the 469 radial velocity amplitude is still consistent with nonradial sectoral modes @xmath3 = 1 , and possibly @xmath3 = 2 , but with @xmath5 @xmath2 1 , which is at least 3 orders of magnitude less than the predicted value given the 3.3 day period of @xmath0 bootis . </S>",
    "<S> such low values of @xmath5 can probably be excluded given the lack of photometric variations for this star . </S>",
    "<S> although the measurements presented here do not prove , without any doubt , that @xmath0 boo has a planetary companion , they do add significantly to the increasing body of evidence in favor of this hypothesis . </S>"
