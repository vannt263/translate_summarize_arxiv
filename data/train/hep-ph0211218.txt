    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak physics is a remarkable achievement .",
    "precision electroweak experiments have probed the sm at the level of quantum effects and have confirmed every feature of the theory . in particular , the set of precision electroweak ( ew ) data has tested the sm beyond one - loop level and no significant deviations from sm predictions have been observed .",
    "the symmetry breaking sector of the sm has been investigated through its virtual effects and precision measurements strongly prefer the existence of a weakly coupled higgs boson by constraining its mass to be @xmath5 gev at @xmath6 cl @xcite .",
    "this upper bound may be relaxed if certain classes of new physics contributions beyond the sm are present at the tev scale and compensate for the indirect effects of a heavier scalar sector @xcite .",
    "however , because of decoupling , models with an elementary higgs scalar typically yield small contributions to the electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "direct evidence for the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics has yet to be observed , and searches for higgs boson production have placed the compatible lower bound @xmath7 gev .",
    "the existence of a weakly coupled higgs sector generates the hierarchy problem , which is a long - standing puzzle in particle physics .",
    "few candidates exist for the mechanism which solves this problem .",
    "supersymmetry naturally stabilizes the hierarchy , as the quadratically divergent loop contributions to the higgs mass cancel between the fermion and boson contributions , provided the supersymmetry breaking scale is near a tev @xcite .",
    "novel theories with extra dimensions exploit the geometry of the higher dimensional spacetime to resolve the hierarchy @xcite and result in numerous phenomenological consequences at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry has the additional feature of remaining weakly coupled up to high scales , whereas quantum gravity becomes strong at the tev scale in these extra - dimensional models .",
    "experimental confirmation of either scenario has yet to occur .",
    "recently , another scenario has been developed which attacks the hierarchy problem in a new way , while maintaining a weakly coupled scalar sector .",
    "this scenario is known as the little higgs @xcite where the higgs is effectively a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "these theories are realizations of earlier attempts @xcite to stablize a higgs which arises as a pseudo - goldstone boson resulting from a spontaneously broken non - linear approximate symmetry .",
    "this approximate global symmetry protects the higgs vev relative to the uv cut - off of the theory , @xmath8 , which appears at a higher scale .",
    "the recent progress was attained in models of dimensional deconstruction @xcite , where the quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass were shown to cancel with contributions from new fields in non - trivial descriptions of theory space .",
    "the phenomenology of these models was examined in @xcite .",
    "the recent little higgs models have the advantage of not requiring a non - trivial theory space in order for the quadratic divergences to be eliminated .",
    "the novel feature of these cancellations , is that the divergent contributions from a particular particle are cancelled by a new particle of the _ same _ spin .",
    "hence , these theories predict the existence of new @xmath9 quarks , gauge bosons , and scalars , all with masses at the tev scale , in order to remove the relevant divergences .",
    "in addition , a small mass for the higgs boson , of order 100 gev , is naturally obtained from multi - loop corrections .",
    "the most economical model of this type to date , known as the littlest higgs @xcite , is based on an @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model .",
    "the uv cut - off of this theory occurs at @xmath10 tev , where the nonlinear sigma model becomes strongly coupled . here",
    "@xmath11 is the decay constant of the pseudo - goldstone boson and is necessarily of order a tev .",
    "the @xmath12 symmetry breaking is generated at the scale @xmath8 by strong interactions similar to technicolor which act only at the high scale @xmath8 and have no remnants at a tev .",
    "the 14 goldstone bosons remaining after this symmetry breaking yield a physical doublet and a complex triplet under @xmath13 ; the remaining fields are eaten by a higgs - like mechanism when the intermediate symmetry is broken .",
    "the one - loop contributions to the quadratic divergences from the electroweak gauge sector are removed by making use of the @xmath14 weakly gauged subgroup @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the divergent contributions must then involve couplings of both groups and hence first appear at two - loop order .",
    "this combination of gauge couplings breaks the global symmetries and generates a small mass of order 100 gev at the two - loop level for the scalar doublet field . at one - loop order ,",
    "the higgs mass is not sensitive to the effective high scale @xmath8 , and its mass is thus relatively stable assuming @xmath16 tev .",
    "the scalar triplet acquires a mass at the tev scale from one - loop gauge interactions .",
    "a massive vector - like @xmath13 singlet @xmath9 quark is responsible for canceling the one - loop divergences originating from the sm top - quark .",
    "the physical spectrum of this model below a tev is thus simply that of the sm with a single light higgs . at the tev scale four",
    "new gauge bosons @xmath17 ( an electroweak triplet and singlet ) appear , as well as the scalar triplet @xmath18 , and a single vector - like quark @xmath19 . for the quadratically divergent corrections to cancel naturally , and",

    "other models have been investigated @xcite and are based on the cosets @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of strongly interacting fermions at the scale @xmath8 .",
    "these cases differ from the littlest higgs in that they require the introduction of additional scalars , gauge bosons , and vector - like quarks at the tev scale , and sometimes extra light scalar fields can arise at @xmath27 gev .    in this paper , we examine the effects of the components of the little higgs on precision electroweak observables and in direct searches for new particles .",
    "we concentrate on the minimal model here , the littlest higgs @xcite , as it contains all the essential ingredients and provides a representative example of these types of theories .",
    "we would expect the more complicated scenarios listed above to be even further constrained by experiment in the absence of any fine - tuning due to the presence of the additional new particles at the tev scale .",
    "consistency with the global precision electroweak data set is a tough barrier for any new model to pass , and we find that the littlest higgs does not necessarily decouple quickly enough for most of the parameter space . a thorough examination of the parameter space reveals small regions where precision data , alone , allows for scales in the theory to take on their natural values , , @xmath28 tev .",
    "however , we find that the most stringent constraint arises from the direct search for new gauge bosons in drell - yan production at the tevatron @xcite and that this excludes these regions .",
    "together , the direct and indirect data samples place the constraints @xmath29 tev , and @xmath30 tev , indicating that significant fine - tuning is required if this scenario is to work .",
    "the outline for the remainder of this paper is as follows : in the next section we present the formalism for our analysis .",
    "we start with a description of the parameters in this theory and then give a derivation of the shifts that occur in the precision electroweak observables . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "we first examine the bounds obtained from direct searches for new gauge bosons at the tevatron .",
    "we then study the case where the new particles take on sm values for their coupling strengths and perform a fit to the electroweak data set and obtain tight constraints on the model .",
    "we then vary these couplings within natural ranges and demonstrate that there is a region of parameter space where the precision data bounds are relaxed , but is still excluded by the tevatron data .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "to begin our analysis , we follow the notation of arkani - hamed and generate the masses of the @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] gauge bosons through the leading two - derivative kinetic term for the non - linear sigma model @xmath31 where @xmath32 tev and the @xmath33 represents the goldstone boson fields .",
    "the fourteen fields @xmath34 include the sm weak iso - doublet @xmath35 , an isotriplet @xmath18 as well as the true goldstone bosons which are eaten in the breaking of the intermediate symmetry to the sm .",
    "we choose the normalization @xmath36 such that the normalization of the kinetic term above is in agreement with that in earlier work on the non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual higgs doublet vev , the triplet @xmath18 also acquires an @xmath13 breaking vev .",
    "we demonstrate in the appendix that including the contribution from the triplet vev to the precision electroweak observables only strengthens our conclusions ; here we adopt a conservative approach and neglect this piece in the following .",
    "we note that the presence of a scalar triplet is not a generic feature of little higgs models .",
    "the covariant derivative of @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where a sum over the index @xmath39 is understood and the ` charge ' ( @xmath40 ) and ` hypercharge ' ( @xmath41 ) matrices are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to proceed further in the calculation of the gauge boson masses it is useful to define the following combinations of the above @xmath15_k$ ] gauge couplings : @xmath42 inverting these relations yields @xmath43 and similarly for @xmath44 .",
    "to zeroth - order in the higgs vev , one linear combination of the gauge bosons obtains a mass at the tev scale when the intermediate symmetry is broken , while the second set remains massless .",
    "the massive neutral fields and their corresponding masses are given by @xmath45 the corresponding charged isospin partner of the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , obtains an identical mass : @xmath48 the orthogonal linear combinations @xmath49 together with the corresponding charged field , @xmath50 , remain massless at this order .",
    "they will play the roles of the sm fields and acquire masses through the usual higgs mechanism which are proportional to the higgs vev , @xmath51 .    in performing the comparison to precision electroweak and collider data",
    ", one must include the shifts in the sm - like gauge boson masses due to mixing with the heavier states , , the higgs vev induces a finite mixing between the states @xmath52 and the corresponding lighter fields . for the neutral fields , which form a @xmath53 mass matrix ,",
    "this mixing is most easily examined via a power series expansion in the ratio of the higgs vev relative to @xmath11 . for the charged fields ,",
    "since the mass matrices are now only @xmath54 , exact eigenvalues in a compact form can be easily found .",
    "the leading corrections to the masses of the lighter sm - like fields are of relative order @xmath55 so that , numerically , @xmath56 corrections can be safely neglected .",
    "when discussing the effects of the heavy gauge fields on precision measurements , we will consistently keep all terms of relative order @xmath57 . turning now to the light mass eigenstates , we define the zeroth - order weak mixing angle as follows : @xmath58 so that the physical @xmath59 and @xmath60 bosons become ( to @xmath61 ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 are defined below in eq . 15 .",
    "for the physical @xmath64 bosons we obtain @xmath65 which can easily be written in terms of the unmixed fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 note that the mixing between these states vanishes in the limit @xmath69 or , more specifically , when @xmath70 .",
    "the physical @xmath60 contains a small admixture of the heavy fields proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "these parameters , which define the mixing between the light sm - like @xmath60 and the heavy neutral gauge bosons , are given to order @xmath57 by : @xmath72 again we note that these mixing terms vanish in the symmetric limit when @xmath70 and @xmath73 .",
    "from this we see that _ all _ light - heavy gauge boson mixing vanishes in the symmetric case .",
    "this will have important consequences below .",
    "the masses of the physical @xmath74 and @xmath60 bosons are then given by ( to @xmath61 ) : @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the usual gauge boson masses that satisfy the tree - level sm relations : @xmath77 .",
    "these shifts in the masses of the gauge fields contribute to the deviation of the @xmath78-parameter from its sm value .",
    "these contributions alone yield @xmath79 note that as we might have anticipated the gauge contribution to @xmath80 vanishes in the symmetric limit , , when @xmath73 .",
    "this is expected as in this limit the @xmath81 and @xmath60 are just the usual sm fields . as we will discuss below",
    "there is an additional new contribution to @xmath80 beyond that arising from the tree level shifts of the gauge boson masses described here .",
    "this is due to the mixing of the top quark with the new vectorlike isosinglet field , @xmath19 .",
    "this contribution , which we denote by @xmath82 , arises from the new @xmath83 and @xmath1 quark loops that do not appear in the sm .",
    "as we will see , these mixing induced contributions can be numerically significant in some regions of the parameter space and must be included .",
    "the reason for their significance is that such terms can be parametrically enhanced by powers of @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( though correspondingly suppressed by powers of the @xmath86 mixing angle ) .",
    "note that even though the additional isosinglet quark is vector - like , since it mixes with the top quark it does not fully decouple , , it can lead to small but important corrections to @xmath80 via mixing over some parameter space regions - particularly those where the @xmath86 mixing angle is large .",
    "( here we do not mean that as the @xmath1 mass increases its contribution to @xmath80 does not go to zero , , the classical meaning of decoupling . )",
    "thus the complete new contribution to the shift in the @xmath78-parameter is the sum of @xmath82 and @xmath87 .    to proceed further with an analysis of precision data and collider constraints",
    ", we must examine how the sm fermions transform under the group @xmath88 with @xmath89_k$ ] .",
    "here we take the fermions to transform non - trivially only under @xmath90 .",
    "this choice is not unique and at least two other possibilities exist .",
    "the first alternative is when the fermions transform identically under both @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this possibility is excluded here since it would require a doubling of the number of fermions .",
    "a second somewhat convoluted alternative would have the fermions transform under , say , @xmath90 as well as the @xmath92 piece of @xmath91 . in this case , doubling of the number of fermions is not required , but such a possibility would allow for an additional free parameter in the fermion couplings to the @xmath60 .",
    "it would seem that our choice is more natural and economical and avoids the issue of fermion doubling .",
    "however , we will make some particular notes in our numerical analysis below of the dependency of the choice of fermion couplings to the heavy hypercharge gauge boson .",
    "the @xmath83 and @xmath1 quarks contribute at one - loop to @xmath93 as discussed above , as well as to @xmath94 , the ratio of the b - quark to total hadronic width of the @xmath60 . in order to compute these contributions",
    "we must examine the @xmath86 mass matrix which can be obtained from the yukawa couplings provided in @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of this matrix requires a bi - unitary transformation , which for real yukawa couplings implies that two separate rotations on the @xmath83 and @xmath1 fields , @xmath95 , must be performed . here",
    "@xmath95 rotates the left(right)-handed components of the quark fields .",
    "it is important to note that the rotation @xmath96 is actually unphysical since both @xmath97 and @xmath98 transform identically under @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath99 , however , is physical and leads to , , flavor violating @xmath100 couplings .",
    "since the mass matrix is a simple @xmath54 rotation , the matrix @xmath99 contains only a single parameter : a mixing angle @xmath101 . writing the ratio of the yukawa couplings as @xmath102 and",
    "recalling @xmath103 one finds @xmath104 from which it follows that @xmath105 since by definition @xmath106 , this immediately provides a bound on @xmath101 .",
    "we find that @xmath107 since @xmath108 is relatively small this greatly restricts the range of @xmath101 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath86 mass matrix are now easily obtained with the smaller one being identified with the physical top quark .",

    "( for simplicity we set @xmath116 in what follows . ) the couplings of the @xmath83 and @xmath1 to the @xmath81 and @xmath60 fields are altered by the presence of the mixing and are represented by the parameter @xmath101 , , ordinarily the isosinglet @xmath1 would not couple to the @xmath81 .",

    "note the presence of the flavor - changing coupling that we alluded to above .",
    "there are now five graphs which contribute to the vacuum polarization of the @xmath60 boson and two graphs for the @xmath81 ; the usual sm contribution must be subtracted from these new contributions to @xmath82 . to proceed",

    "the shift in @xmath174 depends only on the coupling of the fermions to the @xmath244 gauge bosons , and not on their coupling to the hypercharge bosons ; this will therefore remain true for other choices of fermion transformation assignments .",
    "we also see that while @xmath94 is not affected until @xmath243 , both @xmath175 and @xmath176 are very sensitive to the deviations predicted by the littlest higgs , and that the agreement between the predicted values for these observables and the experimental measurements is always worse than in the sm .    finally , we discuss the effect on the fit of the nutev measurement of the on - shell value of the weak mixing angle @xmath192 .",

    "we will assume both the central value and error determined by the nutev collaboration , and repeat our analysis including the nutev result . to demonstrate that the allowed range of @xmath11 is unaffected by the inclusion of the nutev measurement",

    "comparing these figures with those presented previously , we see that the constraint on @xmath11 is unchanged by the addition of the nutev data .",

    "the shifts induced by the littlest higgs model ( @xmath248 @xmath249 ) can not compensate for the large @xmath250 @xmath249 deviation of the sm prediction from the nutev results .    before concluding we note that we have not discussed the possible influence of measurements of atomic parity violation ( apv ) on the fits . until recently the experimental value of the weak charge , @xmath251 , differed from the predictions of the sm by about @xmath252 @xcite .",
    "after a series of detailed theoretical calculations including various atomic effects it now seems that experiment and theoretical predictions are in agreement @xcite .",

    "we have performed a thorough exploration of the parameter space of this model and have found that there are small regions allowed by the precision data where the parameters take on their natural values . when the additional limits provided by the tevaton are included , these regions are no longer permitted . by combining the direct and indirect effects of these new states",
    "we have constrained the ` decay constant'@xmath11 to rather large values @xmath253 tev ; similarly , to satisfy both sets of data @xmath4 tev which is far beyond the reach of direct searches at the lhc .",
