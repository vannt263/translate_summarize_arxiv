    "natural hamiltonian systems are the mathematical models of those physical systems for which the energy is constant , for example harmonic oscillators or the kepler system .",
    "often , as in the previous two examples , more quantities are constants of the motion ( or _ first integrals _ ) : angular momentum , laplace - runge - lentz vector , etc . usually , these constants are expressed by quadratic polynomials in the momenta or , for quantum systems , by second - order differential operators .",
    "hamiltonian systems with constants of the motion of degree higher than two are less common , nevertheless , some of them are of great interest , as for instance the three - body jacobi - calogero and wolfes systems .",
    "these systems represent the dynamics of three point - masses on a line under forces determined by the potential functions @xmath4 respectively ( we do not consider here the harmonic oscillator terms ) and they have essentially the same dynamics @xcite . both the resulting natural hamiltonians in @xmath5 admit one linear and one quadratic in the momenta constants of the motion , making the systems liouville - integrable and solvable by separation of variables ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other two independent constants of the motion do exist , one quadratic , due to the multiseparability of the hamiltonian , and one cubic .",
    "the systems are then maximally superintegrable ( ms ) , having a number of functionally independent constants of the motion equal to twice the degrees of freedom , minus one ( for quantum systems , the same number of algebraically independent symmetry operators ) .",
    "ms systems are of the greatest importance in mathematical physics , harmonic oscillators and kepler are ms and this makes them to satisfy bertrand s theorem . indeed , maximal superintegrability manifests itself , for classical systems , in the fact that all finite orbits of ms systems are closed while , for quantum systems , in the fact that the energy levels are totally degenerate @xcite .",
    "in recent years , several techniques made possible the construction of classical and quantum hamiltonian systems , ms and not , with first integrals of arbitrarily high degree @xcite whose study , still in development , produced remarkable results in special functions , quantum algebras , canonical quantization theories @xcite . in this note it is shortly introduced the work on the topic done by claudia chanu , luca degiovanni and the author ( in short cdr ) in several joint articles . in few words ,",
    "the extension procedure ( theorem [ teo0 ] ) adds one degree of freedom to some suitable hamiltonian @xmath6 in such a way an extra non trivial first integral , polynomial of degree @xmath7 , of the new hamiltonian do exist .",
    "the following theorem , stated in @xcite , defines and characterizes what we intend for `` extensions '' in the particular case of natural hamiltonians on cotangent bundles of riemannian manifolds ; for a more general definition , see @xcite .",
    "given an @xmath8-dimensional natural hamiltonian @xmath6 on the cotangent bundle of a ( pseudo)-riemannian manifold @xmath9 , let be @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath6 , then    [ teo0 ] let @xmath9 be a @xmath8-dimensional ( pseudo-)riemannian manifold with metric tensor @xmath13 . the natural hamiltonian @xmath14 on @xmath15 with canonical coordinates @xmath16 admits an extension @xmath17 in the form ( [ hamext ] ) with a first integral @xmath18 with @xmath19 given by ( [ u ] ) and @xmath20 , if and only if the following conditions hold :    1 .   the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hessian tensor of @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath26 the extended hamiltonian @xmath17 and",
    "the first integral @xmath27 are @xmath28 for @xmath29 the extended hamiltonian @xmath17 and the first integral @xmath27 are @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34    in @xcite it is proved that @xmath35 is functionally independent from @xmath17 , @xmath6 and any other first integral of @xmath6 in @xmath36 .",
    "the integrability conditions of ( [ hessteo ] ) are discussed in @xcite and it is found that their complete integrability requires @xmath37 , where @xmath31 is the constant curvature of @xmath9 . then , the function @xmath20 can depend linearly on up to @xmath38 parameters and the maximal number of parameters is attained on constant curvature manifolds only .",
    "however , non complete solutions can be found in non - constant curvature manifolds ( cdr to appear ) . from equation ( [ vteo ] ) , the expressions of the admissible potentials @xmath22 can be computed .",
    "several examples are given in @xcite .",
    "the particular form of @xmath19 makes possible to explicit any @xmath35 by expanding the @xmath39-th power of a binomial , obtaining @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41}{\\left ( \\begin{matrix } m \\cr 2k \\end{matrix } \\right ) \\gamma^{2k}p_u^{m-2k}\\left(-2m(cl+l_0)\\right)^k},\\ ] ] @xmath42}{\\left ( \\begin{matrix } m \\cr 2k+1 \\end{matrix } \\right ) \\gamma^{2k+1}p_u^{m-2k-1}\\left(-2m(cl+l_0)\\right)^k } , \\quad m>1,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] denotes the integer part and @xmath44 .",
    "we remark that first integrals of high degree obtained in other ways than by the extension procedure @xcite can be explicitly expressed only thanks to the fact that the dynamical equations are in these cases separated in some coordinate system .    as a first example of the extension procedure we consider the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xcite @xmath45 the geodesic term of the extended hamiltonian @xmath17 is @xmath46 where @xmath31 is here the constant curvature of the extended configuration manifold .",
    "the solutions of equations ( [ hessteo ] ) and ( [ vteo ] ) are @xmath47 where @xmath48 . when @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the configuration manifold of @xmath17 is the euclidean plane , the sphere @xmath51 and the pseudosphere @xmath52 respectively , while for @xmath53 and @xmath50 , the minkowski plane , the desitter and anti - desitter manifolds , respectively . after a rescaling of the coordinate @xmath54 , the parameter @xmath39 in @xmath17 passes into @xmath6 and @xmath55",
    "this makes evident that the extension procedure introduces some discrete symmetry into @xmath17 , in this case a dihedral symmetry of order @xmath56 , somehow connected with the extra first integral @xmath35 . in the euclidean plane ( i.e. @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath22 is associated with the jacobi - calogero potential or , equivalently , with the wolfes potential @xcite . indeed , in cylindrical coordinates of @xmath5 , @xmath60 , with axis @xmath61 parallel to @xmath62 w.r .",
    "to cartesian coordinates @xmath63 , we have @xmath64    the procedure of extension provides two new functionally independent first integrals to the extended hamiltonian @xmath17 : @xmath17 itself and @xmath27 .",
    "this fact is particularly relevant when the hamiltonian @xmath6 is ms . in this case , @xmath17 is ms too , admitting @xmath65 functionally independent first integrals . in @xcite this property of extended hamiltonians",
    "is studied in several cases .",
    "for example , let us consider    @xmath66    that is a particular case of the generalized tremblay - turbiner - winternitz system ( ttw ) @xcite for @xmath67 and @xmath68    defined on constant - curvature manifolds of curvature @xmath69 .",
    "this system is ms for any rational parameter @xmath70 and admits polynomial first integrals of degree related to @xmath70 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that @xmath6 always admits extensions of the form @xmath71 with @xmath72 , creating in this way new ms systems .",
    "similarly , harmonic oscillators in @xmath73 , isotropic or not , can be extended into harmonic oscillators in @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the assumption @xmath20 can be generalized to @xmath75 .",
    "this leads to important generalizations , introduced in @xcite , that will be developed in a paper in preparation ( cdr ) .",
    "the extension procedure can be in this case applied with @xmath39 substituted by any positive rational @xmath76 after a suitable definition of @xmath77 , so that the generalized ttw system of above , with @xmath78 , can be written as an extension for any rational @xmath70 .    to classical extended hamiltonians and their first integrals",
    "can be associated quantum hamiltonians and symmetry operators by some procedure of quantization , usually in form of laplace - beltrami operators .",
    "when the curvature of @xmath9 is not constant , the quantization requires additional terms ( quantum corrections ) in order to keep integrability or superintegrability . the quantum correction",
    "is then determined by the scalar curvature and by the weyl tensor @xcite . at least in the case",
    "@xmath79 , the simultaneous quantization of @xmath17 and @xmath80 is possible , allowing the preservation of maximal superintegrability of ms classical extended systems to the quantum limit .",
    "this will be shown in a paper in preparation ( cdr ) ."
