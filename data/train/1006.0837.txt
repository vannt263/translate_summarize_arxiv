    "the quantum characterization of physical systems has a fundamental interest in its own and represents a basic tool for the design of quantum protocols for information processing in realistic conditions .",
    "in particular , the full experimental reconstruction , at the quantum level , of optical systems opens the way not only to high fidelity encoding / transmission / decoding of information , but also to the faithful description of real communication channels and to precise tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite .    among the systems of interest for quantum information processing we focus on the class of bipartite optical states generated by parametric processes in nonlinear crystals .",
    "these are gaussian states and play a crucial role in quantum information processing with continuous variables @xcite . indeed ,",
    "using single- and two - mode gaussian states , linear optical circuits and gaussian operations , like homodyne detection , several quantum information protocols have been implemented , including teleportation , dense coding and quantum cloning @xcite . in particular , gaussian entangled states have been successfully generated in the laboratories by type - ii optical parametric oscillators ( opo ) below threshold @xcite . in these opo systems",
    "the parametric process underlying the dynamics is well described , at least not too close to the threshold , by bilinear hamiltonian , thus the output states are gaussian and they are completely characterized by the first and second moments of their quadratures , i.e. the covariance matrix .    in this paper",
    "we address characterization of bipartite gaussian states and review in details a scheme to fully reconstruct the gaussian output from an opo below threshold , which has been proposed in the recent years @xcite successfully implemented experimentally @xcite . in the present contibution",
    "we give a more accurate description of the experiment and data analisys and , in particular , we pay attention to advanced gaussianity test beyond the simple check of kurtosis .",
    "our method relies on a single homodyne detector : it provides the full reconstruction of the covariance matrix ( cm ) by exploiting the possibility of optically combining the two frequency degenerate opo signal and idler beams and then measuring suitable quadratures on the obtained auxiliary modes .",
    "once the cm is obtained one may retrieve all the quantities of interest on the state under investigation , e.g. energy and squeezing , including those not corresponding to any observable quantity like purity , entropy , entanglement , and mutual information .",
    "quantum properties are discussed in view of the possible use of these states in quantum communication protocols . in particular , we address the dependence of mutual information as a function of the bi  partite system total energy .",
    "of course , a bipartite state is fully characterized by its covariance matrix if and only if it is a truly gaussian one .",
    "usually one assumes that the state to be processed has a gaussian character because the interaction hamiltonians are approximated by bilinear ones and this is often an excellent approximation @xcite . in turn , the resulting evolution corresponds a gaussian operations . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that nongaussian dynamics may occur when the opo approaches the threshold @xcite and when phase diffusion @xcite is present during the propagation and/or the detection stages .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid any possible experimental issue @xcite , a preliminary check on the gaussian character of the signal is crucial to ensure that the actual measured cm fully characterizes the quantum state . for the first time , in this paper , cm data analisys includes advanced statistical tests to assess gaussianity @xcite of the state .",
    "the complete characterization strategy represents a powerful tool to study bipartite gaussians state from the generation stage to the detection one .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "s : chargs ] we introduce the formalism used throughout the paper and , in particular , we review two - mode gaussian states and their covariance matrix as well as the relations among the cm elements and some physical quantities of interest , such as the purity , the entropy and the entanglement . the method to reconstruct the cm",
    "is described in section [ s : rec ] , while section [ s : exp ] is devoted to the details of our experimental implementation .",
    "the analysis of the data and the results are discussed in details in sections [ s : gtest ] , [ s : tomo ] and [ s : results ] . in particular , test of gaussianity",
    "are illustrated in section [ s : gtest ] and results from full quantum tomography in section [ s : tomo ] .",
    "section [ s : concl ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "a @xmath0-mode state @xmath1 of a bosonic system is gaussian if its characteristic function @xmath2(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda } ) = \\mathrm{tr}[\\varrho d(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda})]$ ] has a gaussian form , @xmath3 being the @xmath0-mode displacement operator with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denoting single - mode displacement operators @xcite .",
    "gaussian states are completely characterized by the first and second statistical moments of the quadrature field operators , i.e. by the vector of mean values and by the covariance matrix ( cm ) . since in this paper",
    "we focus on two - mode gaussian states of the radiation field , in this section we review the suitable formalism to describe the system .",
    "we also assume , since this is the case in our experimental implementation , that the mean values of quadratures are zero . upon introducing the vector of canonical operators @xmath7 , in terms of the mode operators",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 the cm @xmath12 of a bipartite state is the real symmetric definite positive block matrix : @xmath13with @xmath14 being @xmath15 .",
    ", @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19 real matrices , representing respectively the autocorrelation matrices of mode @xmath20 and @xmath21 and their mutual correlation matrix .",
    "it can be observed that each block @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written as the sum of two matrices , one containing the product of mean values of @xmath22 and the other contain the mean value of products of operators @xmath23 .",
    "once the cm is known , all the properties of @xmath24 may be described and retrieved . as for example",
    ", the positivity of @xmath1 , besides positivity of the cm itself , impose the constraint @xmath25where @xmath26 is the two - mode symplectic matrix , given in terms of @xmath27 $ ] . inequality ( [ heisenberg principle ] ) is equivalent to the heisenberg uncertainty principle and to positivity , and ensures that @xmath12 is a _ bona fide _ cm .",
    "a relevant result concerning the actual expression of a cm is that for any two - mode cm @xmath12 , there exists a ( gaussian ) local symplectic operation @xmath28 that brings @xmath12 in its standard form , namely @xcite : @xmath29where @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 $ ] , with @xmath0 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 determined by the four local symplectic invariants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 , the matrix is called symmetric and represents a symmetric bipartite state where the energy is equally distributed between the two modes .    by using the symplectic invariants the uncertainty relation ( [ heisenberg principle ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath41it is useful to introduce the symplectic eigenvalues , denoted by @xmath42 with @xmath43 , which in terms of symplectic invariants read as follows @xcite @xmath44where @xmath45 . in this way ,",
    "the inequality ( [ heisenberg principle ] ) re - writes as : @xmath46a real symmetric definite positive matrix satisfying @xmath47 corresponds to a proper cm i.e. describes a physical state .      the purity of the two - mode gaussian state @xmath1 ,",
    "may be expressed as a function of the cm ( [ cm ] ) as follows @xcite : @xmath48 = \\left(16\\ , i_4\\right)^{-\\frac12}.\\ ] ] another quantity , characterizing the degree of mixedness of @xmath1 , is the von neumann entropy @xmath49 .",
    "if the state is pure the entropy is zero @xmath50 , otherwise it is positive @xmath51 and for two - mode gaussian states it may be written as @xcite : @xmath52 where the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath42 are given in ( [ eigenvalues sympletic ] ) the function @xmath53 .",
    "it is useful to recall that for a _ single mode _",
    "gaussian state the von neumann entropy is a function of the purity alone @xcite : @xmath54 whereas for a two - mode state all the four symplectic invariants are involved .",
    "for a two - mode state @xmath24 it is of interest to assess how much information about @xmath24 one can obtain by addressing the single parties .",
    "this is of course related to the correlation between the two modes and can be quantified by means of the quantum mutual information or the conditional entropies @xcite .",
    "given a two - mode state @xmath1 the quantum mutual information @xmath55 is defined starting from the von neumann entropies as : @xmath56where @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are the partial traces , i.e. the density matrices of mode @xmath60 , as obtained tracing over the other mode .",
    "@xmath61 can be easily expressed in terms of the blocks of @xmath12 and its symplectic eigenvalues .",
    "one has @xmath62where @xmath63 is reported above .",
    "the conditional entropies are defined accordingly as @xcite : @xmath64if @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) , the conditional entropy gives the amount of information that the party @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) should send to the party @xmath68 ( @xmath67 ) in order to allow for the full knowledge of the overall state @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) , the party @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) does not need to send any information to the other and , in addition , they gain @xmath71 or @xmath72 bits of entanglement , respectively .",
    "this has been proved for the case of discrete variable quantum systems @xcite and conjectured @xcite for infinite dimensional ones .",
    "a two - mode quantum state @xmath73 is separable if and only if it can be expressed in the following form : @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are single - mode density matrices of the two modes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "viceversa if the state is not separable , it is entangled . a general solution to the problem of separability for mixed",
    "state has not been found yet . for two - mode gaussian",
    "states there exist necessary and sufficient conditions to assess whether a given state is entangled or not .",
    "in particular , there are two equivalent criteria , usually referred to as duan criterion and peres - horodecki - simon criterion , which found an explicit form in term of the cm elements .",
    "the criteria provide a test for entanglement , whereas to assess quantitatively the entanglement content of a state one may use the logarithmic negativity or the negativity of the conditional entropies , as we see below .",
    "this criterion @xcite is based on the evaluation of the sum of the variances associated to a pair of epr - like operators defined on the two different subsystems . for any separable continuous variable state ,",
    "the total variance is bounded by twice the uncertainty product . for entangled states",
    "this bound can be exceeded and the violation provides a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement .",
    "the criterion leads to an inequality that can be expressed in terms of standard form cm elements : @xmath79with @xmath80 .",
    "a separable state will not satisfy the above inequality .",
    "the criterion raises from the fact that for an entangled state it is possible to gain information on one of the subsystems suitably measuring the other one .",
    "also phs criterion establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of bipartite gaussian states @xcite .",
    "given the cm @xmath12 , the corresponding two - mode gaussian state is not separable iff : @xmath81where @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 is the cm associated with the partially transposed density matrix .",
    "thanks to the symplectic invariants @xmath84 the inequality ( [ phs : crit ] ) can be written in a form that resembles the uncertainty relation ( [ heis rel .",
    "sympl invariant ] ) @xcite : @xmath85or , in terms of standard form cm elements , as : @xmath86or simply as : @xmath87where : @xmath88are the symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath89 and @xmath90 therefore , iff @xmath91 the gaussian state under investigation is entangled .",
    "for an entangled state a quantitative measure of entanglement can be given on the observation that the larger is the violation @xmath91 the stronger the entanglement , or more properly , the stronger the resilience of entanglement to noise @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic negativity for a two - mode gaussian state , is given by @xcite ( remind that @xmath92 ) @xmath93and it is a simple increasing monotone function of the minimum symplectic eigenvalue @xmath94 ( for @xmath91 ) : it thus represents a good candidate for evaluating entanglement in a quantitative way .",
    "it is worth to note that also the negativity of the conditional entropies ( [ cond12 ] ) and ( [ cond21 ] ) is a sufficient condition for entanglement @xcite .",
    "this way of assessing quantum correlations between two modes is named after the analogy with the epr correlation defined for a system undergone to a quantum nondemolition measurement ( qnd)@xcite . let us consider two subsystems @xmath20 and @xmath21 , qnd establishes , in principle , that measurement performed on subsystem @xmath21 , does not affect system @xmath20 .",
    "this criterion is equivalent to state that the conditional variance @xmath95 of a quadrature of beam @xmath20 , knowing beam @xmath21 , takes a value smaller than the variance @xmath20 would have on its own .",
    "the conditional variance can be expressed in terms of the unconditional variance @xmath96 of subsystem @xmath20 ( _ i.e. _ the variance that the same quantity has in the subsystem @xmath20 space ) and normalized correlation @xmath97 between the two @xcite : @xmath98 , an analogous relation holds for @xmath99 .",
    "a bipartite state is said to be epr correlated if it verifies the following inequality : @xmath100that can be rewritten in terms of standard form cm elements as follows : @xmath101 . if the inequality is satisfied in the system described by the cm the information on @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) extracted from a measurement on @xmath21 ( @xmath20 ) is sufficient for knowing its state with a precision better than the limit given by the variance for a coherent state . in turn ,",
    "epr correlations are stronger than entanglement @xcite , i.e. all epr states are entangled whereas the converse is not true and there are entangled states violating ineq .",
    "( [ correlation epr ] ) .",
    "in this section we describe in some detail the method we have implemented to experimentally reconstruct the cm given in eq .",
    "( [ cm ] ) and , thus , to fully characterize a bipartite gaussian state .",
    "as expected , each autocorrelation block , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , is retrieved by measuring only the single - mode quadratures of the concerned mode @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "diagonal terms of @xmath16 correspond to the variances of @xmath102 and @xmath103 and are directly available at the output of the homodyne detection .",
    "off - diagonal terms are instead obtained by measuring the two additional quadratures @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and exploiting the relation @xmath106 @xcite . the block @xmath17 is reconstructed in the same way from the quadratures of @xmath21 .",
    "elements of block @xmath18 involve the products of quadrature of modes @xmath20 and @xmath21 and can not be obtained by measuring individually the two modes .",
    "instead they are obtained by homodyning the auxiliary modes @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 and by making use of the following relations : @xmath111it is worth to note that since @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the measurement of the @xmath114-quadratures is not mandatory .",
    "as we will see in the following , our experimental setup allows one to mix the modes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , say the signal and idler , thank to the polarization systems at the opo output . at the same time , the quadratures @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 required for the entanglement measurement and for the reconstruction of the cm can be easily and reliably reconstructed from the pattern function tomography applied to data collected in a @xmath119 scan of the homodyne detector .",

    "the transmittivity of the cavity output mirror , @xmath125 , is chosen in order to guarantee , together with crystal losses ( @xmath126 ) and other losses mechanisms ( @xmath127 ) , an output coupling parameter @xmath128 @1064 nm of @xmath123 0.73 , corresponding to an experimental linewidth of @xmath129 mhz @1064 nm . in order to obtain a low oscillation threshold ,",
    "opo cavity geometry is set to warrant simultaneous resonance on the pump , the signal and the idler : pump resonance is guaranteed by servo - assisting the opo cavity with a drever pound hall system @xcite , while the resonance of other beams is induced by exploiting the natural birefringence of the ktp to tune the optical path of each beam inside the cavity , through a fine control of the crystal temperature and tilt @xcite .",
    "the opo is equipped with an handmade control system able to stabilise the non - linear crystal temperature up to 0.1mk .",
    "measured oscillation threshold is @xmath130 mw ; during the acquisition the system has been operated below threshold at @xmath12360% of the threshold power .",
    "the signal and idler modes are then sent to the covariance matrix measurement set - up : this consists in a preliminary polarisation system , that allows choosing the beam to be detected and a standard homodyne detector .",
    "the polarisation system is made of an half - wave plate ( @xmath131 ) followed by a polarising beam splitter ( pbs ) ; the different wave - plate orientations allow choosing the beam to be transmitted by the pbs : the signal ( @xmath20 ) , the idler ( @xmath21 ) or their combinations @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the other auxiliary modes @xmath134 and @xmath114 may be obtained by inserting before the pbs an additional quarter wave plate ( @xmath135 ) @xcite .",

    "once a beam is selected , it goes to a homodyne detector put downstream the pbs .",
    "this exploits , as local oscillator , the laser output @1064 nm , previously filtered and adjusted to match the geometrical properties of the opo output : a typical interferometer visibility is 0.98 .",
    "the lo oscillator phase @xmath136 is spanned thanks to a piezo - mounted mirror , linearly driven by a ramp generator which is , in turn , adjusted to obtain a @xmath119 variation in @xmath137 ms . the homodyne photodiodes ( pds , model _",
    "epitaxx etx300 _ ) have both nominal quantum efficiencies of @xmath1230.91 and each is matched to a low - noise trans - impedence ac ( @xmath138 few khz ) amplifier .",
    "the difference photocurrent is eventually further amplified by a low noise high gain amplifier ( _ miteq au 1442 _ ) .    in order to avoid low frequency noise ,",
    "the photocurrent is demodulated with a sinusoidal signal of frequency @xmath139=3 mhz and low - pass filtered ( @xmath17=@xmath140 khz ) , to be sent to a pci acquisition board ( gage 14100 ) that samples it with a frequency of @xmath141pts / run , with 14-bit resolution .",
    "the total electronic noise power of the acquisition chain is 16 dbm below the shot noise level , corresponding to the a snr @xmath12340 .",
    "since the covariance matrix contains the full information only for gaussian states , a preliminary check on the gaussian hypothesis is necessary in order to validate the entire approach . at first , in order to asses the gaussianity of our data set we have evaluated the _ kurtosis excess _ ( or fisher s index ) is calculated .",
    "then , once gaussianity is proved , a more sophisticate test is used to check the statistical quality of the collected data . in particular , the _ shapiro  wilk _",
    "@xcite test checks whether the collected data come from a truly random normal distribution , i.e. whether or not the data ensemble is a faithful replica of a gaussian statistical population .",
    "we underline the importance of gaussianity tests , which is usually assumed rather than actually verified experimentally on the basis of analysis of opo data .",
    "the kurtosis is the distribution fourth order moment , and can be seen as a sort of `` peakedness '' measurement of a random probability distribution . compared to the gaussian value of @xmath142 ( where @xmath143 is the standard deviation ) the kurtosis ",

    "@xmath150 gives an immediate check on the gaussianity of the data ensemble , whereas it can not say anything about accidental ( or systematic ) internal correlation between data .",
    "overall , the use of the kurtosis test only may not lead to a conclusive assessment of gaussianity .    for this purpose",
    "we adopt the _ shapiro - wilk _ ( sw ) tests , which is suitable to test the departure of a data sample from normality .",

    "the two tests verify two complementary aspects .",
    "even if the sw one is considered a faithful gaussianity test it can fail either for a non - gaussian or for non truly random distributions . once the gaussianity of the data is proved , by means of the kurtosis excess @xmath150 , the sw test is used as a test for the randomness of the data ensemble .",

    "calibration with respect to the shot noise is obtained by obscuring the opo output and acquiring the vacuum quadratures .",

    "accordingly , the error on blocks @xmath16 and @xmath17 elements is obtained by propagating the relative tomographic error . on the other hand , when dealing with , phase dependent , squeezed states , a small uncertainty in setting the lo phase @xmath136 can result in a non negligible indeterminacy on the quadrature variance used to reconstruct the relative @xmath207  element . as a consequence , when evaluating the errors on the elements of the block @xmath18 , one must take into account the noise properties of the involved modes and critically compare the tomographic error with the error due to the finite accuracy on @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath208 and @xmath209 are obtained as combinations of squeezed / anti  squeezed variances , which , are stationary points of the variance as function of @xmath136 , thus they are quite insensitive to @xmath136 fluctuations ; accordingly the overall tomographic error can be reliably used in this case . on the contrary @xmath210 and @xmath211",

    "this fact is not surprising : the state is rather robust ( the mean photon number of the system is @xmath1232.4 ) but the correlation , while ensuring the non  separability of the state , does not provide epr  like effect .",
    "such a state would not be useful in quantum protocols where epr is exploited whereas it is sufficiently correlated for enhancing the security of cv qkd .",

    "this reflects in a higher value for the mutual information @xmath234 carried by t he state .",

    "this effect is the well known polarization cross - talk .",
    "indeed , in the ideal case the opo output is in a twin - beam state @xmath235 , @xmath236 being the entangling two - mode squeezing operator : the corresponding cm has diagonal blocks @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 with the two diagonal elements of each block equal in absolute value . in realistic opos ,",

    "in addition , spurious nonlinear processes , not perfectly suppressed by the phase matching , may combine to the down conversion , contributing with local squeezings . finally , due to small misalignments of the nonlinear crystal ,",
    "a residual component of the field polarized along @xmath20 may project onto the orthogonal polarization ( say along @xmath21 ) , thus leading to a mixing among the modes @xcite .",
