    "massive stars play a key role in the evolution of the galaxy ; hence they are important objects of study in astrophysics . although their number is much smaller than the low mass stars , they are the principal source of heavy elements and uv radiation , affecting the process of formation of stars and planets @xcite and the physical , chemical and morphological structure of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "diverse studies show that massive stars are formed in the denser regions of giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) @xcite .",
    "the formation process of high - mass stars is , however , still under debate @xcite .",
    "observationally , recently formed massive stars can not be detected at optical wavelengths because they are embedded within regions with high dust extinction .",
    "another problem arises from theoretical considerations : a star with a mass larger than eight solar masses starts burning hydrogen during the accretion phase and the radiation pressure may halt or even reverse the infall process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to these difficulties , a paradigm that explains the formation of massive stars does not exist @xcite , contrary to the successful model accepted for low mass stars .",
    "understanding the physical process that dominates during the early stages of the formation of massive stars and its influence back on its harboring molecular gas requires a study of the physical conditions of the environment previous to the star formation or at very early stages .",
    "the object of our study is one of the most massive gmcs in the southern galaxy , at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , in the tangent region of the norma spiral arm @xcite .",
    "several observations have shown that the central region of this gmc harbors one of the most extended and luminous regions of massive star formation in the galactic disk .",
    "single dish radio continuum observations show the presence of an extended region of ionized gas ( ) , with an angular size of @xmath25(projected size 6.5 - 8.7 pc at a distance of 7.5 kpc ) , close to the peak co position of the gmc @xcite . from observations of the h109@xmath26 and h110@xmath26 hydrogen recombination lines",
    ",  @xcite determined that the line central velocity of the ionized gas is @xmath27 -89 , similar to the peak velocity of the gmc .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the region of ionized gas is @xmath28 years , and the rate of ionizing photons required to excite the  region is @xmath29 s@xmath14 .",
    "in addition , iras observations show the presence of an extended source , with an angular size similar to that of the ionized region and a fir luminosity of 3.6@xmath30 @xmath12 .",
    "while both the ionizing photon rate and the fir luminosity could be provided by a single o4 zams star , it is most likely that the ionization and the heating of the region is provided by a cluster of massive ob stars .",
    "this explanation is supported by _ midcourse space experiment _ and _ spitzer space telescope_-glimpse survey data , which show that there are several sites of massive star formation spread over a region of @xmath31 in diameter .",
    "@xcite showed that toward the @xmath32 galactic longitude , there is a peak in the number density of iras sources with colors of ultracompact ( uchii ) regions and associated with  emission , which are thought to correspond to massive star forming regions .",
    "evidence of active star formation in the  gmc is further provided by the detection of oh and methanol maser emission @xcite , as well as h@xmath33o maser emission ( caswell , private communication ) .",
    "hydroxyl masers are known to be excellent indicators of uchii regions , whereas methanol maser emission is a common phenomenon in regions of massive star formation @xcite and h@xmath33o maser emission is thought to be a probe of the earliest stages of massive star formation @xcite .",
    "also , within a radius of 4.5 centered on the peak position of   there are three objects from the red msx source ( rms ) catalog of massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) candidates @xcite , further indicating that the  central region is an active region of massive star formation .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed the presence of a compact , extremely high velocity molecular outflow in the  region , suggesting that it is driven by one of the most luminous and massive objects presently known .",
    "the  region is thus an ideal region to study extremely active massive star formation in gmcs .",
