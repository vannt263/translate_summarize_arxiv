    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum magnetism involves the study of materials with magnetic ions of low - spin state , @xmath0 = 1/2 or 1 , which are coupled magnetically along one crystallographic direction only . due to the rich nature of the low - temperature and field - induced phases in these materials , quasi-1d quantum magnets ( q1dqm ) and",

    "these values are substantially larger than those determined previously .",
    "@xcite within our extensive analysis , we succeeded in estimating the order of magnitude of the interchain couplings .",
    "the theoretical part of the present paper should be understood also as a step in the direction to fill the existing gap of the not fully explored @xmath38 model , beyond providing an assignment of the main exchange parameters for a specific material only .",
    "in particular , a precise knowledge of the main exchange parameters is one of the prerequisites to attack in a realistic manner rather complex and not yet fully understood phenomena such as multiferroicity @xcite and multipolar phases / spin nematics @xcite reported or suggested for the title compound , too .",
    "the single crystals of pbcuso@xmath1(oh)@xmath2 used in this study for the magnetization , nmr , and x - band esr measurements are natural minerals with their origin in california , usa ( _ origin 1 _ : blue bell mine , baker , san bernadino ) . a second set of naturally grown single crystals of smaller size ( _ origin 2 _ : siegerland , germany ) has been used for the esr measurements in a resonant cavity at a frequency of about 93ghz .",

    "note that due to hysteresis around the phase transitions observed for the 1.8k data , the sweep rate was significantly varied in these regions in order to check for sweep - rate dependent effects on the phase transitions . using quasi - static conditions ,",
    "the observed small hysteresis in the @xmath40 curves became negligible , as shown below .",

    "the determination of the interchain coupling is not unique and a ( sizable ) impurity contribution might mask weak antiferromagnetic interchain interactions .",

    "[ ] might be useful to achieve a more precise assignment of the details such as the principle nature of the interchain coupling in our compound .",
    "due to the increase of a possible , small impurity contributions with decreasing @xmath34 in our compound , the maximum positions of the impurity corrected susceptibilities are upshifted by a few tenths of a k. naturally the effect is largest for the @xmath5-axis susceptibility ( shift @xmath3 0.5k ) .",
    "nevertheless , a significant anisotropy remains also for these `` corrected '' susceptibilities which points together with the obtained largest exchange integral @xmath7 for the @xmath5 axis to a corresponding easy - axis assignment . to improve further the theoretical analysis",
    ", a detailed consideration of an anisotropic @xmath7-@xmath8 model would be desirable which , however , is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "for a first estimate see fig .",
    "16 and the short discussion given below .",
    "noteworthy , the quality of the fits can be improved without adopting a curie - weiss like impurity contribution , if instead a model with symmetric exchange anisotropy is applied . according to previous theoretical investigations of edge - shared cuprate chains with a ferromagnetic nearest neighbor exchange coupling , an easy - axis exchange anisotropy is expected .",

    "such an easy - axis exchange anisotropy affects significantly the low - temperature behavior of @xmath78 and the saturation field in the low @xmath18-region of interest .",
    "following ref .  , but ignoring weak anisotropy effects for the next - nearest neighbor exchange ( i.e. , setting @xmath225 ) , we rewrite the leading term in the expression for the 1d saturation field valid in the two - magnon case at weak interchain coupling as    @xmath226 \\right ) , \\label{hsataniso}\\ ] ]    and analogously in the one - magnon case : @xmath227 the effect of the easy - axis anisotropy under consideration on the in - chain exchange coupling @xmath7 is illustrated in fig .",

    "such a behavior is in accord with a similar effect found for the magnetic susceptibility data fitted by the isotropic and the aniosotropic model as shown in figs .",

    "<S> we present a detailed study in the paramagnetic regime of the frustrated @xmath0 = 1/2 spin - compound linarite , pbcuso@xmath1(oh)@xmath2 , with competing ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our data reveal highly anisotropic values for the saturation field along the crystallographic main directions , with @xmath3 7.6 , @xmath3 10.5 and @xmath3 8.5 t for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 axes , respectively . in the paramagnetic regime , this behavior is explained mainly by the anisotropy of the _ g_-factor but leaving room for an easy - axis exchange anisotropy . within the isotropic @xmath7-@xmath8 spin model </S>",
    "<S> our experimental data are described by various theoretical approaches yielding values for the exchange interactions @xmath7 @xmath3 -100k and @xmath8 @xmath3 36k . </S>",
    "<S> these main intrachain exchange integrals are significantly larger as compared to the values derived in two previous studies in the literature and shift the frustration ratio @xmath9 @xmath10 0.36 of linarite closer to the 1d critical point at 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> electron spin resonance ( esr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements further prove that the static susceptibility is dominated by the intrinsic spin susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the knight shift as well as the broadening of the linewidth in esr and nmr at elevated temperatures indicate a highly frustrated system with the onset of magnetic correlations far above the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath11 = 2.75(5)k , in agreement with the calculated exchange constants . </S>"
