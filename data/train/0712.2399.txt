    "although the basic weak interaction is relatively well known , there exist large uncertainties of the weak couplings of mesons and baryons at the hadron level relevant at low and intermediate energies up to about 1 gev , _",

    "for example the efforts to determine the parity nonconserving ( pnc ) couplings @xcite report uncertainties of the order of 100 % or more of the recommended `` best '' values .",
    "( for reviews see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in this situation even the signs of couplings may be suspect .    considering the weakness of the couplings their experimental determination is a big challenge and attempts often utilize nuclear structure to enhance pnc effects . however , the analysis of the basic couplings is then complicated by the environment . among few - nucleon systems",
    "also polarized photoreactions have been used with the deuteron .    in principle , the most direct way without external disturbances would be @xmath2 scattering . presently pnc @xmath6 scattering experiments are unlikely and even @xmath5 scattering experiments are scarce @xcite . among these of particular interest is the measurement of the parity violating spin observable @xmath7 in the triumf experiment e497 at 221.3 mev @xcite .",
    "the energy was chosen so that incidentally the strong interaction phases conspire to cause the @xmath8 contribution to cross zero @xcite .",
    "while in this amplitude both @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are equally important , the next @xmath11 parity mixing amplitude is strongly dominated by @xmath9 exchange enabling a drive towards pnc @xmath12 coupling .",
    "the above logic is based on the idea that the dominant pnc effect in @xmath5 scattering should be due to vector mesons , since long - ranged single pion exchange is forbidden by barton s theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem forbids in general neutral @xmath13 mesons to couple with nucleons in the pnc interaction because of the simultaneous violation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 symmetries .",
    "so in the pnc @xmath5 interaction at low energies only @xmath9- , and @xmath10-meson exchanges are expected to be significant and the two - pion exchange ( tpe ) is assumed negligible @xcite . with these assumptions the triumf experiment e497 @xcite would , in principle , result in the determination of the weak @xmath12 coupling constant @xmath16 from @xmath17 scattering .",
    "the lower energy experiments @xcite have already determined the independent combination of @xmath18+@xmath19 ( where @xmath20 ) and so both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are supposedly determined separately .    in view of such",

    "in fact , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath21-isobar excitation by weak @xmath9 and strong ( mainly ) pion exchange has a significant effect on @xmath7 at all energies and should also be considered . in spite of pnc single pion exchange being excluded in @xmath5 scattering ,",
    "crossed charged two - pion exchange is allowed .",
    "charged pions are also possible in two - pion exchanges involving the excitation of the @xmath22 resonance .",
    "the former was studied already in the early works @xcite , while calculations for the latter were performed above the pion production threshold in refs .",
    "however , the @xmath21 contribution extends also below this to low energies ( as shown with vector meson exchanges in ref .",

    "our aim in the present paper is to calculate this potential including realistic form factors and extending the calculation to the observable @xmath23 .",
    "further interest in tpe lies in the fact that it should be the longest ranged pnc effect in @xmath5 scattering , which might show up in energy dependence .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we evaluate numerically pnc tpe as a potential in the momentum representation assuming the baryons to be static .",
    "this potential can be well fitted by lorentz functions of the momentum transfer , which in turn can be expressed in terms of yukawa functions in the coordinate representation .",
    "it may be noted that the result will be local ( excluding relativistic corrections ) and a comparison with the local parts of vector meson exchanges is then straightforward .",
    "next we discuss non - static effects in three different kinematics and dynamics allowing kinetic energies for baryons .",

    "time orderings of parity nonconserving ( black spot ) two - pion exchange ( dashed line ) via nucleon ( solid line ) delta ( bar ) intermediate state .",
    "both the crossed and box graphs include the @xmath27 intermediate state while the @xmath2 intermediate state can appear only in the crossed graphs .",
    "the direction of time is upwards . ]    unfortunately , in literature choices of the signs in the above definitions vary , both overall and even in the @xmath24 _ vs. _ @xmath30 vertices . in purely strong interactions",

    "[ last ] . this kind of cusp structures arise in dynamical coupled channels calculations ( as isospin one `` dibaryon '' resonances in the case of @xmath57 thresholds giving rise to maxima e.g. in pion production ) , but the present one is somewhat sharper than the wide maximum seen in ref .",
    "however , there it was produced by pnc @xmath9 exchange interfering with the strong transition involving both pion and a destructive @xmath9 . in the present case , to be consistent with the tpe potential , we have exclusively the long ranged pion exchange in both transition potentials without damping other than the form factor .",

    "this additional contribution leads to an overestimate , but the newer ones @xcite can give a tolerable agreement ( though we do not include nonlocal pnc here ) especially , if non - static effects are included .",
    "however the ddh and fcdh `` best '' values for the @xmath61 might be too large in the light of the experimental restrictions given by the @xmath90f parity violating measurements @xcite , which bound the upper limit in the range @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "some theoretical predictions are also within this limit @xcite .",
    "further , one should note that the relative sign of the pion strong and weak coupling may be unknown in the vertex definitions ( [ h1])([h3 ] ) even if the weak magnitude were given .",
    "the knowledge of this coupling is essential , since the pions are more than five times lighter than the vector mesons and thus the pnc tpe presumably represents the longest range part of the weak interaction in @xmath5 scattering .    in particular relating to the triumf experiment at 221.3 mev we get at that energy the tpe contribution 0.48 to @xmath7 in the static model and in the nonstatic `` symmetric '' model 0.26 ( 0.28 in the `` asymmetric '' one ) .",
    "these may set rather realistic limits though the even larger result 0.70 using the coupled channels model should be noted .",
    "however , these are obtained using the older ddh coupling @xmath93 and can be easily scaled for the value from the fcdh analysis @xmath94 or any other .",
    "the long ranged ope transition potential produces also a manifest cusp peak at 600 mev in a coupled channels calculation . whether or not this will be diminished in the presence of vector mesons will be discussed in a subsequent work @xcite .",
    "there are two competing effects : destructive interference from the @xmath9 exchange in the strong transition potential and the contribution from the @xmath9 in the pnc transition as discussed earlier @xcite . in any case , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite an experimental point between the triumf and los alamos energies would be of interest ."
