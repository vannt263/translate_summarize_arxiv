    "the fabrication of monolayer graphene @xcite provides an opportunity to study the effect of sample topology on its electronic properties @xcite .",
    "the low energy excitations of the gapless graphene are described by a two dimensional massless dirac equation @xcite .",
    "these excitations are negatively charged and behave like electrons with the fermi velocity @xmath0 . in graphene , even a small external charge impurity @xmath1 can produce strong nonperturbative effects , since the effective coulomb interaction strength @xmath2 , where the dielectric constant @xmath3 .",
    "thus , graphene provides an ideal system to analyze the combined effects of topology and strong electric fields on its electronic properties .    the idea of a critical charge plays an interesting role in this context @xcite .",
    "it is well known that massless dirac fermions can tunnel through large external potentials , thereby avoiding trapping or formation of bound states .",
    "this phenomenon , known as klein tunneling @xcite , is possible in graphene due to the chiral nature of the dirac excitations @xcite .",
    "however , when the effective strength of the external charge exceeds a certain critical value @xmath4 , the low energy excitations can form quasi - bound states @xcite .",
    "for such states the wavefunctions oscillate rapidly near the position of the charge impurity , analogous to _ zitterbewegung _ in strong field qed @xcite .",
    "for planar graphene , the critical charge @xmath5 . the existence of such quasi - bound states and their effect on transport properties and local density of states ( ldos ) in planar graphene have attracted considerable attention @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore how a nontrivial topology of the sample may affect the critical charge and the corresponding strong field qed effects in graphene .",
    "we address this issue for graphene cones , which are obtained by introducing local defects in the hexagonal lattice structure , for example , in the form of a pentagonal ring @xcite .",
    "the conical topology manifests itself in the form of nontrivial holonomies for the pseudoparticle wavefunctions .",
    "such holonomies can be modelled through the introduction of a magnetic flux tube .",
    "thus an electric charge localized at the apex of the cone can be equivalently described by a suitable combination of electric charge and magnetic flux tube .",
    "we show that the critical charge @xmath4 depends on the angle of the graphene cone . for certain angle of the graphene cone ,",
    "the topological effects lead to the identification of the two fermi points @xcite .",
    "this leads to the surprising conclusion that for a certain value of the angle of the cone , the critical charge is zero .",
    "we discuss the effect of the conical topology on the scattering phase shifts , quasi - bound state energies and local density of states ( ldos ) in graphene .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we set up the dirac equation for gapless graphene cone with a point charge at the apex .",
    "this is followed by the analysis of the corresponding spectrum , where we obtain the scattering phase shits , quasi - bound state energies and local density of states ( ldos ) and show how these physical quantities depend explicitly on the sample topology .",
    "we also briefly comment on the rg flow of the strength of the charge impurity .",
    "we end this paper with some discussion and outlook .",
    "in this section we set up the dirac equation for a graphene cone with a coulomb charge at the apex of the cone .",
    "the low energy properties of the quasiparticle states near the dirac points in graphene can be described by the four component dirac wave function @xcite given by @xmath6 the pseudospin indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 label the two sublattices of the primitive cell of graphene and the valley indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 label the two inequivalent dirac points @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",

    "the pauli matrices @xmath18 and the identity matrix @xmath19 act on the pseudospin indices@xmath20 . the coulomb interaction strength @xmath21 .",
    "from now on we set @xmath22 . in a two dimensional plane , the angular boundary condition for a dirac spinor as it goes around a closed path is given by @xmath23    a cone is obtained from the two dimensional plane by introducing a topological defect , which modifies the angular boundary condition ( [ h1.2 ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , consider a cone , formed by removing the sector @xmath24 ( see fig.1a . ) and then identifying the edge @xmath25 , labeled by @xmath26 with the edge @xmath27 , labeled by @xmath28 .",
    "the sector @xmath24 subtends an angle @xmath29 at the centre @xmath30 . due to this identification",
    "the frame @xmath31 becomes discontinuous across the joining line .",
    "this problem can be solved by choosing a new set of frames given by @xmath32 which is rotated with respect to old frame @xmath33 by an angle @xmath34 in the counter clockwise direction , see fig.1b . to keep the form of the hamiltonian the same",
    ", the wave function has to be transformed by @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath36 sectors are removed from the plane where @xmath36 can take only discrete values @xmath37 , the wave function should be transformed as @xmath38 note that an additional negative sign appears in the boundary condition since we take the angular part of the wavefunction to be @xmath39 , @xmath40 being a half integer @xcite .",
    "[ ht ]     [ ht ]   from the plane sheet.,title=\"fig : \" ]    when n is odd , an additional phase change is required due to the breaking of the bipartite nature of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "it can be seen from the fig.([fig:2 ] ) , that the removal of a wedge of opening angle @xmath29 introduces a pentagonal defect .",
    "when the cone is formed by removing a single wedge of angle @xmath29 , the adjacent points on two sides of the identification line belong to the same sublattice .",
    "this feature is valid for all allowed odd @xmath41 and leads to a system with only one fermi point .",

    "note that for @xmath45 , the angular boundary condition for the planar graphene is recovered .",
    "for the allowed even values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , it can be seen from ( [ h1.8 ] ) that the matrix @xmath43 plays no role in the angular boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that for even @xmath36 , @xmath48 } = \\cos ( { \\frac { \\pm n \\pi}{2 } } ) =   e^{i \\pi [ \\frac { \\pm n } { 2}]}$ ] . for odd @xmath36 ,",
    "the two dirac points are identified and the energy eigenstates of the dirac equation are obtained by diagonalizing @xmath43 which mixes the valley indices in the wavefunction @xcite . since the eigenvalues of @xmath43 are @xmath49 , for all values of @xmath36 , we can replace the angular boundary condition ( [ h1.8 ] ) by @xmath50}\\psi(\\mathbf{r},\\theta=0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in subsequent analysis , we shall use the form ( [ h1.9 ] ) of the angular boundary condition assuming that for all allowed odd values of @xmath36 , the matrix @xmath43 acting on the valley indices has already been diagonalized .",
    "the effect of the angular boundary condition ( [ h1.9 ] ) on the wave function can be equivalently described by introducing a magnetic flux tube passing through the apex of the cone @xcite .",
    "the presence of a magnetic vector potential modifies the boundary condition on a dirac spinor as @xmath51 taking @xmath52 as a line element on the circumference of the cone at a distance @xmath16 from the apex , we have @xmath53 substituting ( [ h6 ] ) in ( [ h5 ] ) and assuming that @xmath54 is independent of the angle @xmath55 , we get @xmath56 comparing equation ( [ h1.9 ] ) and equation ( [ h7 ] ) we get @xmath57.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus the entire effect of the conical topology on the wavefunction can be described by introducing the vector potential ( 10 ) , which replaces the ordinary derivatives by the corresponding covariant derivatives in the hamiltonian ( [ h1.1 ] ) . in this effective description ,",
    "the hamiltonian for a graphene cone with a coulomb charge at the apex is given by @xmath58 where the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be obtained from the equation([h1.5 ] ) , which gives @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus the dirac equation ( [ h1.1 ] ) can be written as @xmath64 we use an ansatz for the wavefunction given by @xmath65 where the total angular momentum @xmath40 takes all half integer values . substituting ( [ h12 ] ) in ( [ h11 ] )",
    ", we note that the leading short distance behaviour of the wavefunction is given by @xmath66 from ( [ h16 ] ) it follows that when @xmath67 exceeds @xmath68 , @xmath69 becomes imaginary . as a result , the eigenstates @xmath70 and @xmath71 becomes wildly oscillatory and have no well defined limit as @xmath72 , which corresponds to the phenomenon of zitterbewegung in a strong coulomb electric field @xcite .",
    "the critical value of the coupling is denoted by @xmath4 and it is given by the minimum allowed value of @xmath68 .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 depends on @xmath40 and the number of sectors @xmath36 removed from a plane to form the graphene cone .",
    "hence we see that the critical coupling @xmath4 explicitly depends on the angle of the graphene cone .",
    "the values of the critical charge for different values of n are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".the values of critical charge @xmath4 i.e the minimum values of @xmath68 for different values of opening angle of the graphene cone i.e for different values of @xmath36 .",
    "the values of angular momentum @xmath40 for which we get the critical charge are also noted .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the maxima and minima of the oscillations occur at half - integral and integral multiple of @xmath74 respectively .",
    "the normalization constant of the wave function depends on the value of @xmath36 which decreases with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , though the nature of standing wave oscillation is similar for @xmath45 and @xmath75 , the amplitudes of the corresponding ldos decreases with the increase of @xmath36 .",
    "it is known that in the planar case , under the rg flow , a supercritical charge is driven to its critical value @xcite .",
    "while the full discussion of the rg flow requires a more detailed analysis , we can obtain some of its qualitative features from the quasi - bound state energies .",
    "to see this consider the real part of @xmath76 in ( [ gl16 ] ) which gives the energy .",
    "this part diverges as the cutoff @xmath77 . in order to study the rg flow ,",
    "we now promote the coupling constant @xmath78 as a function of @xmath79 and demand that as @xmath77 , the energy for any fixed level @xmath80 ( say @xmath81 ) remains independent of the cutoff @xcite . in the leading order , where @xmath78 is only slightly above the critical coupling",
    ", this prescription gives the @xmath82-function as @xmath83 thus we have an ultraviolet stable fixed point at @xmath84 or at @xmath85 .",
    "hence , for any given value of @xmath36 and @xmath40 , the coupling @xmath78 in the supercritical regime is driven to its critical value .",
    "we end this section with a comment for the case @xmath86 , which occurs for @xmath46 and @xmath87 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the first order dirac equations ( [ g5 ] ) and ( [ g6 ] ) completely decouple and the functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 become independent of each other . in this case , the critical coupling @xmath4 also vanishes .",
    "this means that any external charge , no matter how small , would lead to the supercritical regime .",
    "in this paper we use the fact that system of a graphene cone with an external coulomb charge at its apex can be equivalently described by the combination of the coulomb charge and a suitable magnetic flux tube passing through the apex .",
    "the above analysis has been done in the supercritical regime , where the external coulomb charge exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "the quantities of physical interest in this system include the scattering phase shifts , the ldos and the quasi - bound state energies .",
    "we have shown that all these physical quantities depend explicitly on the number of sectors removed from a planar graphene to form the cone .",
    "the existence of the quasi - bound states indicates the possibility of the localization of the wavefunctions in the presence of a supercritical charge .",
    "our analysis shows that the nature and extent of the localization depends on the spatial topology of the graphene sample .",
    "finally , we have given qualitative arguments which shows that under the rg flow and for @xmath90 , the supercritical charge in the graphene cone tends to its critical value .",
    "if this argument can be extended for @xmath86 , for which the critical charge vanishes , that would lead to complete shielding of the external charge .",
