    "the allowed continuous motions preserve the lengths and connectivity of the bars ( as in the finite framework case ) and ( this is the new addition ) _ symmetry with respect to the group @xmath0_. however , the representation of @xmath0 is _ not _ fixed and may change .",
    "figures [ fig : gam2graphtoperiodic ] and [ fig : gam4graphtoperiodic ] show examples .",
    "a crystallographic framework is _ rigid _ when the only allowed motions ( that , additionally , must act on the representation of @xmath0 ) are euclidean isometries and _ flexible _ otherwise .",
    "the topic of this paper is the following question : _ which crystallographic frameworks are rigid and which are flexible ? _ in its most general form , this question does nt seem computationally tractable : even for finite frameworks , the best known algorithms rely on exponential - time grbner basis computations .",

    "generically_and almost all crystallographic frameworks are generic  we can say more with theorem [ theo : main ] ( stated below in section [ sec : mainstatement ] ) : generic rigidity and flexibility depend on the _ combinatorial type _ of the framework , given by a _ colored graph _ , which is a finite , directed graph with elements of a group on the edges .",
    "moreover , theorem [ theo : main ] is a `` good characterization '' in that a polynomial time combinatorial algorithm can decide whether a colored graph corresponds to generically rigid crystallographic frameworks .    thus , theorem [ theo : main ] is a true analog of the landmark maxwell - laman theorem @xcite from rigidity theory , which characterizes generic rigidity and flexibility of finite frameworks in the plane .",
    "we stress that the genericity hypotheses made by theorem [ theo : main ] are _ on the geometry of the framework only _ , which is the same as genericity assumptions from the theory of finite frameworks .",
    "a @xmath0-crystallographic framework is given by the data @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an infinite graph , @xmath0 is a crystallographic group , @xmath3 is a free @xmath0-action with finite quotient on @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is an assignment of positive lengths to each edge @xmath6 . to keep the terminology in this framework manageable",
    ", we will refer simply to _ frameworks _ when the context is clear , with the understanding that the frameworks appearing in the paper are crystallographic .",
    "a _ realization _ @xmath7 of the abstract framework @xmath1 is defined to be an assignment @xmath8 of points to the vertices of @xmath4 and a representation @xmath9 of @xmath10 by euclidean isometries acting discretely and co - compactly , such that @xmath11 the condition says that a realization respects the given edge lengths , which appears in the theory of finite frameworks .",

    "this is a very important feature of the model : the motions available to the framework include those that deform the representation @xmath9 of @xmath0 , provided this happens in a way compatible with the abstract @xmath0-action @xmath3 .      the _ realization space _ @xmath14 ( shortly @xmath15 ) of an abstract framework is defined as the set of its realizations . motions of the framework are , then , continuous paths in the realization space . to factor out trivial motions , we define the _ configuration space",

    "( see section [ sec : continuous ] for a detailed treatment of these spaces . )",
    "we remark that the definition makes it clear that we are interested in what is sometimes called `` _ _ local rigidity _ _ '' in the literature : the configuration space may have multiple connected components , each with a different dimension .",
    "we are not concerned with the stronger notion of `` _ _ global rigidity _ _ '' , which requires that @xmath16 be a single point .",

    "the `` _ _ @xmath0-colored - laman graphs _ _ '' appearing in the statement are defined in section [ sec : gamma - laman ] ; genericity is defined in detail in section [ sec : infinitesimal ] , but the term is used in the standard sense of algebraic geometry : generic frameworks are the ( open , dense ) complement of a proper algebraic subset of the configuration space .",

    "a generic @xmath0-crystallographic framework @xmath20 is minimally rigid if and only if its colored quotient graph is @xmath0-colored - laman .",
    "an alternative interpretation of theorem [ theo : main ] is that it characterizes rigidity of finite frameworks in euclidean orbifolds with geodesic bars .",
    "the orbifold is obtained by taking the quotient @xmath21 , where @xmath0 is generated by translations and rotations .",
    "this is what is meant elsewhere in the literature when `` torus '' @xcite or `` cone '' @xcite frameworks are discussed . since we do nt work in this formalism",
    ", we leave the issue of an intrinsic theorem [ theo : main ] aside .      a particularly interesting simplification  that we will see as a `` warm up '' for theorem [ theo : main]is when the symmetry is given by a rotation around the origin through angle @xmath22 .",

    "the formalism is very similar to that for crystallographic frameworks , except everything is finite .",
    "a cone framework is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath2 is a finite graph , @xmath3 is a free @xmath23-action , and @xmath5 is an assignment of positive lengths to each edge @xmath6 .",
    "realizations @xmath26 of the abstract framework @xmath27 are point sets @xmath8 satisfying @xmath28 and the definitions of the realization and configurations spaces , and well as rigidity and flexibility are similar to the crystallographic case .",

    "we define a realization of a crystallographic direction network to be _ faithful _ if none of the edges of @xmath36 are realized with coincident endpoints .",
    "our second main result is an exact characterization of when a generic direction network admits a faithful realization , in the spirit of whiteley s parallel redrawing theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) .",
    "[ theo : direction ] let @xmath0 be a crystallographic group generated by translations and rotations .",
    "a generic realization of a @xmath0-crystallographic direction network @xmath30 has a faithful realization if and only if its associated colored graph is @xmath0-colored - laman .",
    "this realization is unique up to translation and scaling .",
    "the deduction of the rigidity theorem [ theo : main ] from theorem [ theo : direction ] uses the natural extension of our _ periodic direction network method _ from @xcite .",
    "briefly , the steps are :    * we reduce the problem of rigidity , as is standard in the field , to a linearization called _ infinitesimal rigidity_. ( this is defined in section [ sec : infinitesimal ] . ) * we then show that minimal infinitesimal rigidity of a colored graph @xmath29 coincides with generic direction networks on @xmath29 having a faithful realization up to translation and scaling .",
    "( this is done in section [ sec : main - proof ] . ) * theorem [ theo : main ] is then immediate from theorem [ theo : direction ] .",
    "although the steps in sections [ sec : continuous][sec : main - proof ] are , in light of @xcite somewhat routine , we remark at this point that the translation between infinitesimal rigidity and faithful direction network realizability _ does not _ go through when the symmetry group contains reflections .",
    "thus , this additional hypothesis is forced by our proof method .",
    "while , with some additional effort , we might be able to extend the direction network theorem [ theo : direction ] to all two - dimensional crystallographic groups , this improvement would not , by itself , give a more general rigidity theorem .",
    "most of the work in this paper is in the proof of theorem [ theo : direction ] , which proceeds in three parts :    * part [ chap : groups ] studies the crystallographic groups @xmath37 for @xmath38 , giving convenient coordinates to their representation spaces ( sections [ sec : repspace][sec : radical ] ) and developing a matroid on the @xmath37 ( proposition [ prop : mgammarank ] ) .",
    "* part [ chap : graphs ] contains the combinatorial part of the proof of theorem [ theo : direction ] , developing @xmath0-graded sparse graphs ( definitions are given in sections [ sec : gamma22 ] and [ sec : gamma - laman ] ) in terms of matroidal ( proposition [ prop : gamma11 ] ) and decomposition ( proposition [ prop : gamma22-decomp ] ) properties . *",
    "part [ chap : direction - networks ] then develops the theory of direction networks and links the combinatorics of colored graphs defined by sparsity conditions to the geometry of direction networks .",
    "the main result of part [ chap : direction - networks ] is theorem [ theo : direction ] , which is deduced from proposition [ prop : crystal - collapse ] .",
    "readers familiar with @xcite will notice that the broad strokes of the proof plan is similar , but that there is no `` natural representation '' step , in which dependence and independence in colored graph matroids are related to determinantal formulas .",
    "the reason for this is that , in the crystallographic case , the variables arising from direction network realization problems do not separate out as cleanly . thus",
    ", an alternative viewpoint of part [ chap : direction - networks ] is that it introduces new techniques for proving linear representability of sparsity matroids .",
    "the results of this paper are a direct extension of the theory we introduced in @xcite , and they stand on a similar foundation .",
    "our paper @xcite contains a detailed discussion from several historical perspectives .",
    "the general area of rigidity with symmetry has been somewhat active in the past few years , but the results here are independent of much of it . for completeness",
    ", we review some work along similar lines . a specialization of our ( * ?",
    "theorem a ) is due to ross @xcite .",
    "schulze @xcite and schulze and whiteley @xcite studied the question of when `` incidental '' symmetry induces non - generic behaviors in finite frameworks , which is a different setting than the `` forced '' symmetry we consider here and in @xcite .",
    "ross , schulze , and whiteley @xcite have studied the present problems , but they do not give any combinatorial characterizations . borcea and streinu @xcite have proposed a kind of `` doubly generic '' periodic rigidity , where the combinatorial model does not include the colors on the quotient graph .",

    "thus , to prove the theorem , we show that , for a colored graph @xmath29 with @xmath261 vertices and @xmath832 edges , the generic rank of the system [ eq : infinitesimal ] is @xmath386 if and only if @xmath29 is a @xmath0-colored - laman graph .",

    ", there is a non - collapsed realization of this direction network as well : it is simply @xmath19 rotated by @xmath590 . since this is not obtained by taking linear combinations of realizations where every edge is collapsed , the dimension of the space of infinitesimal motions is always at least @xmath837 the proposition follows by subtracting from @xmath838 and comparing to @xmath833 .",
