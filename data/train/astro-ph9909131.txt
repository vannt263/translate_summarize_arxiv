    "while it is known that hydrogen ( together with ) was ionized at redshift @xmath4 , given the presence of transmitted flux to the blue of the hydrogen ly@xmath2 wavelength in sources up to that redshift , the double ionization of helium can take place at a lower redshift .",
    "the reason is simple : even though there are only @xmath5 helium atoms for every 100 hydrogen atoms ,  recombines at a rate @xmath6 times faster than hydrogen .",
    "consequently , if a large number of recombinations for each helium ion take place , then the reionization will be delayed relative to the hydrogen reionization as long as the number of photons emitted to the intergalactic medium ( hereafter igm ) above @xmath7 ev is less than 0.44 times the number of photons emitted above @xmath8 ev .",
    "this condition is satisfied by the known sources of ionizing radiation ( quasars and galaxies ) . in practice",
    ", the mean number of recombinations of  may not be very large : for the uniform igm , the  recombination rate is @xmath9 times the hubble rate at @xmath10 , and then a somewhat softer emission spectrum is required for a delayed  reionization . however , the recombination rate is enhanced by the clumping factor of the ionized gas , which increases as progressively denser gas is reionized , as described recently in miralda - escud , haehnelt , & rees ( 1999 ; hereafter mhr ) .",
    "the present state of the observations of intergalactic  can be summarized as follows : at redshift @xmath11 , there is a  `` ly@xmath2 forest '' , with a flux decrement that is consistent with the hydrogen ly@xmath2 forest flux decrement , and a background spectrum produced by quasars , plus a possible contribution from galaxies to increase the ratio @xmath12 of intensities at the  and  ionization edges ( davidsen et al .",
    "1996 , miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 , bi & davidsen 1997 , croft et al .",
    "1997 ) . at @xmath13 ,",
    "the  ly@xmath2 spectra appear to be divided into two different types of regions : those where transmitted flux is still observed ( with a similar @xmath12 implied for the ionizing background ) , and those where the transmitted flux is undetectable or , at least , much smaller ( see heap et al .  1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the regions with greater transmitted flux occupy a small fraction of the spectrum at @xmath14 , and they have typical widths of @xmath15 .",
    "some of them can be attributed to the proximity effect of the source being observed ( e.g. , hogan et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "these observations are not yet conclusive in clarifying the ionization history of  in the igm .",
    "the reason is that the optical depth of a homogeneous medium with the mean baryon density of the universe , where all the helium is , is very large : @xmath16 therefore , if only a fraction @xmath17 of the average igm helium density is in the form of , the flux transmission can already be reduced to very low levels .",
    "even when the line of sight crosses a void with density @xmath18 ( about the lowest densities in the photoionized igm at @xmath19 according to numerical simulations of cold dark matter models ; see mhr and references therein ) , the void will still be optically thick to  ly@xmath2 photons if its  fraction is greater than @xmath20 .",
    "the implication is that even a very stringent upper limit to the  ly@xmath2 flux transmission does not imply that most of the  had not yet been reionized at the observed redshift .",
    "although the observations quoted earlier could be simply interpreted as revealing an igm with a patchy ionization of , with regions surrounding luminous quasars and a pure  igm filling the volume between the  regions , the correct picture is probably much more complicated . in the regions where no transmitted flux is detected ,",
    "the helium might also be doubly ionized over most of the volume , although with a much lower ionizing background intensity than in the regions near luminous quasars .",
    "the higher  fraction implied in the regions with low intensity , although still much smaller than unity , could be enough to completely absorb the ly@xmath2 photons .",
    "the presence of this low intensity , but widespread , background above the  edge is quite plausible , as discussed in mhr , if there is a modest contribution to the emissivity from sources of luminosity much lower than quasars .    a more direct observational probe to the mean fraction of  in the igm at different redshifts would be highly valuable to test models for the reionization history , which is in turn important for the history of galaxy formation owing to the strong heating of the igm gas produced by the  reionization ( e.g. , efstathiou 1992 ; miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) .",
    "it is shown in this paper that this new probe may be found in the soft x - ray continuum absorption spectra of high - redshift quasars .",
    "the distributed  in the igm should cause , in addition to the  forest absorption in ly@xmath2 and the other lyman series lines , the continuum absorption ( due to photoionization ) below a rest - frame wavelength @xmath21  .",
    "this continuum absorption should be very large near the edge , but the flux should recover at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we shall see that when most of the helium in the igm is , this recovery of the flux should occur at @xmath22 , or an observed frequency of @xmath3 at @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the mean fraction of helium in the igm in the form of  as a function of redshift .",
    "for the moment , we consider a homogeneous igm ( with a uniform fraction @xmath23 ) , but because we shall consider continuum absorption only , the results will be valid also for a clumpy igm , as long as the clumps have a large covering factor .",
    "the continuum absorption spectrum by  on a source at redshift @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the proper length element along the line of sight , @xmath27 is the mean primordial helium density extrapolated to the present epoch , @xmath28 is the photoionization cross section of , and @xmath29 is the observed frequency .",
    "if  is highly ionized at low redshift , most of the contribution to @xmath30 will be from high redshift , where we can use @xmath31 .",
    "we also define @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the frequency at the ionization edge of  ( the function @xmath34 varies only slowly with frequency and is plotted below in fig .  1 ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath35\\ , \\left ( 1+z_s \\right)^3 \\ , \\int_0^{z_s } { dz\\ , f(z ) \\over ( 1+z)^{5/2 } } \\ , { \\sigma_{\\he}[\\nu(1+z ) ] \\over \\sigma_{\\he}[\\nu ( 1+z_s ) ] } ~,\\ ] ] or , using @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 : @xmath40 \\over \\sigma_{\\he}(\\nu_{\\he } ) } \\ , \\int_0^{z_s } { dz\\ , f(z ) \\over ( 1+z)^{5/2 } } \\ , { \\sigma_{\\he}[\\nu(1+z ) ] \\over \\sigma_{\\he}[\\nu(1+z_s ) ] } ~. \\label{hzs}\\ ] ]    as an example , we consider the simple case of a sudden and complete reionization of  at @xmath41 : @xmath42 at @xmath43 and @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "the integral in the above equation is then well approximated as @xmath46 ( for small @xmath47 ) .",
    "for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , so the optical depth reaches unity at an observed frequency @xmath51 kev .",
    "any extragalactic source will also be absorbed in soft x - rays by galactic hydrogen and helium , with a hydrogen column density @xmath52 that can be determined from the  21 cm emission .",

    "this quantity is @xmath59 ( this is shown in detail below , in fig .  1 ) .    dividing the optical depth due to the high - redshift igm from ( [ hzs ] ) by the galactic optical depth in ( [ gals ] )",
    ", we obtain the ratio to be : @xmath60 \\over \\sigma_{\\he}(4\\nu ) } \\ , \\int_0^{z_s } { dz\\ , f(z ) \\over ( 1+z)^{5/2 } } \\ , { \\sigma_{\\he}[\\nu(1+z ) ] \\over \\sigma_{\\he}[\\nu(1+z_s ) ] } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",
    "this fiducial column density is around the lowest value that is usually reached at high galactic latitude ( e.g. , laor et al .",
    "1997 ) . using the same example as in  2 , where the integral is given by @xmath62 , we find @xmath63 \\simeq 1/(3 n_{\\hi,20})$ ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the absorption by high - redshift intergalactic helium should be smaller than the galactic absorption only by a factor @xmath64 when the galactic column density has the lowest value normally found in sources , @xmath65 .",
    "laor et al .  (",
    "1997 ) measured the galactic column densities in a sample of 23 low - redshift quasars from the absorption in soft x - rays . comparing the column densities they derived with those measured from the 21 cm emission , they show that there are no significant differences within observational error .",
    "in particular , the two quasars with the smallest error ( 10% ) in the column density determined from the soft x - ray spectrum by laor et al .  also agree with the 21 cm column density ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "provided that the galactic absorption can be subtracted from the measured x - ray absorption on a high - redshift quasar , given the column density measured from 21 cm emission , it should be possible to detect the continuum absorption of intergalactic helium in the soft x - rays .",
    "a natural question to ask here is if the shape of the absorption can be used to distinguish galactic absorption from the high - redshift absorption .",
    "unfortunately , the shape is almost identical in the two cases , as we shall now see . in figure 1 ,",
    "the solid line is the hydrogen cross section @xmath66 , multiplied by @xmath67 , and the dashed line is @xmath68\\ , ( \\nu/\\nu_{\\hi})^3 $ ] [ so the ratio of the dashed line to the solid line is @xmath57 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ gals ] ) ] .",
    "we have used the exact analytical expression for @xmath66 ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) , and the fit of verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for @xmath69 .",
    "the dashed line is therefore the expected shape of the galactic absorption , except for the fact that some of the ionized gas in the galaxy may not have the helium doubly ionized , and there could then be some additional  absorption at @xmath70 .",
    "this is shown by the dotted line , equal to @xmath71 , and we see that it has almost the same slope as the dashed line at energies @xmath72 kev",
    ".    the intergalactic  absorption should have the same shape as the solid line , at redshift @xmath19 ( because the  cross section is identical to the  cross section shifted to a frequency 4 times higher ) .",
    "notice from equation ( 4 ) that the frequency dependence of @xmath30 is basically the same as the redshifted cross section @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we see from fig .",
    "1 that the high redshift absorption has a slightly steeper cross section than the galactic one . in the range from @xmath73 kev to @xmath74 kev , the galactic cross section is @xmath75 , and the intergalactic helium cross section is @xmath76 . in practice , it will be extremely difficult to reach the high signal - to - noise required to distinguish between these two slopes ; moreover , the intrinsic emission spectrum of the source introduces an additional uncertainty .",
    "therefore , the high - redshift helium absorption can probably be detected only as an excess of absorption over that expected from the galactic column density derived from the 21 cm emission .",
    "in any realistic model , the reionization of all the  in the universe will take place over a substantial length of time , of the order of a hubble time . in the reionization model proposed in mhr ,",
    "the low - density gas is ionized earlier and reionization advances outside - in .",
    "the stage of reionization depends at every redshift on the gas overdensity @xmath77 up to which the helium is mostly ionized to . using results of numerical simulations for",
    "the density distribution and the photon mean free path in the igm , the model in mhr predicts the  ly@xmath2 flux decrement and the fraction of gas at overdensities greater than @xmath77 , assumed to be still in the form of .",
    "the observed flux decrement of @xmath78 at @xmath79 ( davidsen et al .",
    "1996 ) requires @xmath80 , and the fraction of  @xmath81 ( see figs . 2 and 9 in mhr ) . at the slightly higher redshift @xmath82 , a flux decrement as high as @xmath83 ( see heap et al .",
    "1999 ) requires @xmath84 , and the fraction of gas at greater overdensities increases only to @xmath85 , showing how a small increase in  ionization can result in a dramatic decline of the transmitted flux due to the effect that the most underdense voids rapidly become optically thick to the  ly@xmath2 photons .    as an example of a reasonable model matching the above conditions , where the  reionization takes place over an extended period of time",
    ", we consider the simple case @xmath86^{5/2}$ ] , where the first  sources would turn on at @xmath87 .",
    "for this case , equation ( 6 ) yields ( neglecting the ratios of the function @xmath34 ) @xmath88 ( for @xmath89 )",
    ".    it must be born in mind here that whatever contribution arises from low redshifts to the integral in equation ( 6 ) should originate mostly in dense systems , where the helium is self - shielded and remains in the form of  ( these are the observed lyman limit and damped absorption systems ) .",
    "when the mean free path between these absorption systems is not much smaller than the hubble length ( i.e. , when the absorbers do not have a large covering factor ) , the  column density on a particular line of sight will no longer be equal to the mean value , but will have large fluctuations : it will most often be smaller than the mean value , but it will exceed this mean value when a rare , strong absorption system is intersected .",
    "the presence of these rare absorption systems , which should dominate the total  content of the universe at low redshift only , can in principle be determined independently for every line of sight from observations of the  absorption spectrum . in practice , though , the lyman limit absorption from higher redshift systems , and the  ly@xmath2 absorption itself , will prevent the determination of the column density of any low - redshift absorber in a high - redshift source .",
    "the absence of strong metal lines can still be a good indication that a strong  absorber is not present .    in order for a low - redshift absorber to cause soft x - ray absorption comparable to that of the high - redshift igm",
    ", it must have a column density @xmath90 .",
    "only @xmath91 20% of the lines of sight have an absorber with this strength ( e.g. , storrie - lombardi , irwin , & mcmahon 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fluctuation in the low - redshift absorption will be an additional source of uncertainty ( especially if the low - redshift  ly@xmath2 absorption can not be measured ) , implying that the excess soft x - ray absorption will need to be detected in several sources before one can be sure that the effect of the helium in the low - density igm at high redshift has been detected .",
    "the fluctuations in the column density due to high - redshift absorbers of high column density are less important , because these absorbers do not contain a large fraction of the baryons . for example , at @xmath19 we need an absorber with @xmath92 to produce an absorption similar to the igm .",
    "these absorbers are rare , and they can also be readily identified in the  ly@xmath2 spectrum when their redshift is not much lower than the source redshift .",
    "soft x - ray absorption can be a new powerful tool to measure the fraction of helium in the form of  as a function of redshift .",
    "this direct determination of the  fraction provides a straightforward test of any model of reionization based on the observed emitting sources ( quasars and galaxies ) .",
    "although the observations of the  ly@xmath2 absorption spectra provide a much greater wealth of information , their interpretation is more complicated due to the complexities introduced by the highly inhomogeneous igm and the fluctuating intensity of the ionizing background .",
    "the main challenge in detecting this effect will be to find enough high - redshift , x - ray bright sources , and to accurately measure the 21 cm  column density to subtract the galactic contribution to the soft x - ray absorption .",
    "a systematic uncertainty that will be faced is the possible existence of some galactic  along the line of sight , which can also produce excess soft x - ray absorption not accounted for by the galactic  column density .",
    "in addition , extragalactic damped ly@xmath2 absorbers at low redshifts can also make a significant contribution , which may be difficult to correct for in high - redshift sources .",
    "these systematic uncertainties can be put under control once the effect is measured in many sources over a wide range of redshift ."
