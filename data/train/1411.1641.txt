    "after the observation of an 125 gev scalar particle at cern - lhc by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite , the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism has been experimentally stablished .",
    "now , one of the highest priorities of the lhc experiments is to measure precisely the strenghts of the couplings of the higgs boson to fermions and vector bosons @xcite , which will allow to look for new states associated with the breaking symmetry mechanism in models beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , family nonuniversal @xmath0 symmetry models have many well - established motivations .",
    "for example , they provide hints for solving the sm flavor puzzle @xcite , where even though all the fermions acquire masses at the same scale , @xmath2 gev , experimentally they exhibit very different mass values .",
    "these models also imply a new @xmath3 neutral boson , which contains a large number of phenomenological consequences at low and high energies @xcite .",
    "in addition to the new neutral gauge boson @xmath3 , an extended fermion spectrum is necessary in order to obtain an anomaly - free theory .",
    "also , the new symmetry requires an extended scalar sector in order to _",
    "i. ) _ generate the breaking of the new abelian symmetry and _ ii . )",
    "_ obtain heavy masses for the new @xmath3 gauge boson and the extra fermion content .",
    "another consequence of an extended higgs sector is that they may produce deviations of the higgs self - coupling , which could provide an interesting test for the sm higgs boson from future measurents at the lhc collider @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the nonuniversal @xmath0 extension of the type introduced by authors in references @xcite and @xcite , it was proposed an extended scalar sector with two scalar doublets and two singlets with nontrivial @xmath0 charges , where the lightest scalar singlet is taken as candidate for scalar dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "some phenomenological consequences of this model have been studied in the above references , with special emphasis in the neutral gauge and yukawa sectors .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to determine some constraints on the parameters of the higgs potential of the model , first by imposing theoretical bounds through unitarity and vacuum stability , and later by evaluating possible couplings of the observed higgs boson to an extra scalar sector using experimental data at cern - lhc .",
    "in particular , the signal strenght of higgs boson decays to diphotons offers a clean signal to constraint new physics associated to extra scalar sectors , where one loop contributions from the charged higgs bosons is taken into account . also , since the diphoton signal strenght depends on the branching ratio with the total higgs boson decay , it is possible to evaluate the effects of a light dm component as an invisible final state , where the scalar coupling to dm can be constrained . from these constraints and the limits from dm direct and indirect experiments ,",
    "we obtain new limits on the mass values for light dm .",
    "finally , we obtain the higgs self - coupling of the lightest higgs boson in order to evaluate deviations from the sm prediction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] is devoted to describe the spectrum and most important properties of the model .",
    "we also show the scalar couplings , including rotations into mass eigenvectors and trilineal interactions . in section [ sec : unitarity ] , we obtain constraints on the coupling constants of the higgs potential from unitarity and stability conditions , where we use the whole space of parameters in order to obtain the most general bounds . in section [ sec : diphoton ] , we obtain constraints in the space of parameters accessible to the observed decay of the higgs boson to diphoton . for simplicity , in this section",
    "some parameters are taken to be equal . in section [ sec : dm ] we discuss additional constraints from the dm direct and indirect experiments .",
    "deviations to the sm higgs self - coupling is evaluated in section [ sec : trilineal ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the particle content of the model @xcite is composed of ordinary sm particles and new exotic non - sm particles , as shown in tables [ tab : sm - espectro ] and [ tab : exotic - espectro ] , respectively , where column @xmath4 indicates the transformation rules under the sm gauge group @xmath5 , column @xmath6 contains the values of the new quantum number @xmath7 , and in the column labeled `` _ feature _ '' , we describe the type of field .",
    "some properties of this spectrum are as follows :    1 .",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry is nonuniversal only in the left - handed sm quark sector : the quark family @xmath8 has @xmath9 while families @xmath10 have @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   in order to ensure cancellation of the gauge chiral anomalies ,",
    "the model includes in the quark sector three extra singlets @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "they are quasichiral , i.e. chiral under @xmath6 and vector - like under @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   the most natural way to obtain massive neutrinos , according with the evidences of neutrino oscilations , is through a see - saw mechanism , which require the introduction of extra majorana neutrinos .",
    "thus , to obtain a realistic model compatible with massive neutrinos , we include new neutral leptons @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "an additional scalar doublet @xmath17 identical to @xmath18 under @xmath4 but with different @xmath6 charges is included in order to avoid massless charged fermions , and where the individual vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) are related to the electroweak vev through the relation @xmath19 .",
    "an extra scalar singlet @xmath20 with vev @xmath21 is required to produce the symmetry breaking of the @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "we assume that it happens at a large scale @xmath22 .",
    "another scalar singlet @xmath23 is introduced , which will be a dm candidate .",
    "thus , this scalar must accomplish the following properties",
    "@xcite : 1 .",
    "since @xmath23 acquires nontrivial charge @xmath6 , it must be complex in order to obtain massive particles necessary for dm .",
    "terms involving odd powers of @xmath23 induce decay of the dm , which spoils the prediction of the model for the dm relic density .",
    "thus , we demand the following global symmetry @xmath24 3 .   in order to avoid the above symmetry to break spontaneously or new sources of decay",
    ", @xmath23 must not generate vev during the evolution of the universe .",
    "thus , we demand @xmath25 . 7 .",

    "we see that eq .",
    "( [ trilineal - deviation ] ) exhibits another decoupling limit when @xmath237 .",
    "however , due to unitarity and stability , the parameter @xmath238 can not be larger than @xmath239 .    on the other hand , the deviation in ( [ trilineal - deviation ] )",
    "is function of four unknown parameters : @xmath240 .",
    "however , due to the analytical expression for the higgs mass in ( [ higgs - mass-2 ] ) , we can reduce the number of free parameters into three .",

    "we conclude that :    1 .   by combining the unitarity and stability conditions ,",

    "the observed diphoton higgs decay at lhc imposes phenomenological constraints on the above couplings as well as on other scalar parameters .",

    ", decays into dm is forbidden for masses above @xmath260 gev . by assuming that the lightest higgs boson corresponds to the observed one",
    ", we obtain very stringent bounds on the free parameters .",
    "in particular , small and negative values of the ratio @xmath238 is favoured , which implies that the mixing couplings between higgs doublets are suppresed as compared with the diagonal couplings .",
    "since the diagonal coupling @xmath165 must be positive because of the stability of the higgs potential , negative mixing couplings is favoured by the experimental data from diphoton decay . also",

    "we found allowed intervals consistent with lhc data on the diphoton decay in an scenary where invisible decay into a light dm candidate is possible .",
    "4 .   using the above diphoton constraints",
    ", we evaluate the allowed masses for dm compatible with the observable relic density of the universe . for the range @xmath264 from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we found allowed masses in the range @xmath208 gev @xmath265 gev for light scalar dm , with only a few allowed points around the resonance at @xmath266 gev .",
