    "the hyperbolic numbers ( called also split  complex , or perplex , or double numbers , etc . ) are known since long ago but they are not as popular as complex numbers or quaternions . at the same time",

    "consider the inequality @xmath2 ; it turns out that it has a well  defined set of solutions in @xmath0 and one can think of them as of the probabilities of some random events .",
    "this was a motivation of the present work : to test how this conjecture operates .",
    "first of all , we give a review of hyperbolic numbers making a special emphasize on the properties of non  negative hyperbolic numbers .",

    ". it is followed by a series of the immediate properties of such probabilistic measures .",
    "the last section 5  conditional probability \" introduces this notion , including the case of probabilities which are zero  divisors in @xmath0 , and presents the hyperbolic generalizations of several classic facts : multiplication theorem , independence of random events , law of total probability , bayes theorem .",
    "altogether , we have shown that the basic facts ( elementary but underlying ) of the classic probability theory extend onto the situation under consideration .",

    "hence , the hyperbolic probability has the following interpretation : one deals with a stochastic experiment which generates the necessity to endow the @xmath5algebra of the events with two probabilistic measures which are seen as @xmath4valued measures ; what is more , a rich multiplicative structure is introduced on the range of such measures .",
    "such situations may emerge in mathematical statistics in testing composite hypotheses .",
    "another example is provided by thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
    "consider a physical system which has two ( or more ) minima of free energy .",
    "if the system is in an equilibrium then it can be in any of these states with certain probabilities but it can not be known for sure in which of them ; this is exactly the situation we are interested in .",
    "we believe that our approach will be useful in treating such situations although in the present work we limit ourselves with considering the basics of purely mathematical theory .",
