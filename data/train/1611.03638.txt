    "the discovery of the isotope effect on the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 in metallic hg @xcite in the year 1950 provided the key experimental evidence for phonon - mediated pairing and leads to the subsequent formulation of the bcs theory .",
    "an involvement of the lattice degrees of freedom into the supercarrier formation is generally considered by measuring the isotope effect exponent on @xmath0 : @xmath6 ( @xmath2 is the isotope mass and @xmath7 is the mass difference ) and by further comparing it with the universal value @xmath8 as is predicted within the framework of bcs theory of electron - phonon mediated superconductivity .    in conventional phonon - mediated superconductors like simple metals , alloys , _ etc . _",
    "@xmath9 , typically , ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 , ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the only exceptions are ru and zr exhibiting zero isotope effect and pdh(d ) with @xmath10.@xcite the negative isotope effect of pdh(d ) is explained , however , by the presence of strong lattice anharmonicty caused by the double - well potential in the proton ( deuteron ) bond distribution.@xcite a similar finding exists in organic superconductors where the h(d ) isotope effect changes sign as compared , _",
    "e.g. _ , to @xmath11s , @xmath12c , and @xmath13n isotope replacements , ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "again , an unusually strong anharmonic lattice dynamics are attributed to this observation.@xcite recently the sine changed isotope effect was reported by stucky _",
    "et al._@xcite for @xmath14doped srtio@xmath15 which supposed to be purely phonon - mediated superconductor .",
    "it was observed that the substitution of the natural @xmath16o atoms by the heavier isotope @xmath17o causes a giant ( of the order of 50% ) enhancement of @xmath0 .",
    "also the magnetic critical field @xmath18 is increased by a factor @xmath19 . such a strong impact on @xmath0 and @xmath18 , with a sign opposite to conventional superconductors",
    "was assumed to be caused by strong coupling to the ferroelectric soft modes of srtio@xmath15 .",
    "the cuprate high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) are characterized by a vanishingly small but positive isotope effect exponent in optimally doped compounds which increases in a monotonic way upon decreasing doping.@xcite for the optimally doped cuprate hts the smallest value of the oxygen - isotope exponent @xmath20 was obtained for yba@xmath21cu@xmath15o@xmath22 and bi@xmath21sr@xmath21ca@xmath21cu@xmath15o@xmath23 , while it reaches @xmath24 for bi@xmath21sr@xmath25la@xmath26cuo@xmath27.@xcite in addition , it was demonstrated that in underdoped materials @xmath28 exceeds substantially the bcs limit @xmath29.@xcite    it is worth to emphasize here that the values of both , the oxygen and the copper isotope exponents in cuprate hts are _ always _ positive . similar tendencies , with the only few above mentioned exceptions , are also realized in a case of conventional phonon - mediated superconductors .",
    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in fe - based compounds few experiments to study the isotope effect on @xmath0 in this new class of materials were performed .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that the very controversial results for fe - ie on @xmath0 are caused by small structural changes occurring simultaneously with the fe isotope exchange . the fe - ie exponent on @xmath0 [ @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the isotope mass ] needs to be decomposed into two components with the one related to the structural changes ( @xmath3 ) and the genuine ( intrinsic one , @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of such decomposition is further confirmed by the fact that @xmath4 coincides with the fe - ie exponent on the characteristic phonon frequencies @xmath5 as is reported in recent exafs and raman experiments . </S>"
