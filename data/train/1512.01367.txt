    "rotation curves of nearby galaxies provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "they were first obtained using optical spectroscopy @xcite and soon thereafter radio observations in the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) revealed that rotation curves remain flat over many multiples of the optical radius .",
    "studies of the rotation curves of the inner parts of galaxies are important in discerning competing models of dark matter .",
    "the cuspy dark matter density profiles predicted from @xmath1cdm simulations require steeply rising rotation curves @xcite , while pseudo - isothermal halos representing a cored potential are seen observationally @xcite .",
    "these halo models show the largest differences in the centres of galaxies .",
    "it is hence essential that we form a better understanding of the kinematics in the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "the central parts of spiral galaxies , especially early - types , tend to have little or no hi , making it difficult to determine the central dynamics from observations of the hi alone .",
    "however , molecular gas is typically concentrated in the centres of galaxies , and co is an abundant tracer of the molecular gas ( @xmath2 ) content of galaxies .",
    "compared to hi , co is more easily observable at higher redshifts , which makes co an alternative tracer of the dynamics in studies of the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) .",
    "the five colleges radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) survey @xcite , the berkeley illinois maryland association survey of nearby galaxies ( bima - song , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the recent survey by @xcite are some of the most comprehensive surveys of the co content of spiral galaxies .",
    "more recently , the atlas-3d @xcite survey carried out observations of early type galaxies , and the nuclei of galaxies collaboration studied the molecular chemistry and dynamics of the inner parts of nearby active galaxies .",
    "pioneering studies of the kinematics of spiral galaxies with co observations were presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , concerted efforts have been made to map a representative sample of nearby galaxies in hi and co with the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the hera co line extragalactic survey ( heracles , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "these surveys , in combination with ancillary data at other wavelengths , provide a comprehensive view of the gaseous ism of nearby galaxies .    in this paper , we study the kinematics of the co in a sample of the things galaxies using the heracles data , and we extend the analysis of the dynamics performed in @xcite ( hereafter db08 ) , by including the contribution of the molecular gas .",
    "we compare our results to the analysis of the hi kinematics , aiming to address the following questions : how similar are the kinematics of the co and the hi ? how does the co - tfr compare with the hi - tfr for the same sample of galaxies ? what is the effect of adding molecular gas on the derived mass model parameters ?",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : the - data ] we describe the co and hi data ; in section [ sec : velfields ] we describe how we compute the velocity fields .",
    "the rotation curve derivations are described in section [ sec : rotcur - derivation ] . in section",
    "[ sec : rotcurs ] we present rotation curves . in section",
    "[ sec : tfr ] we present the tfr . in section [ sec : massmodels ] we outline the motivation and the method used in constructing mass models , and we present the results of the mass modelling in section [ sec : massmodelresults ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our study of the dynamics of the galaxies in our sample in section [ sec : discussion - summary ] .",

    "notable studies of the molecular gas content of ngc 3627 are @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the comparison of the hi and co data is shown in figure [ fig:3627-atlas ] .",
    "the heracles data shows that the co distribution is lopsided and although the co velocity fields shows a general velocity gradient , the iso - velocity contours and the _ pv _ diagram show signs of non - circular motions .",
    "the hi - co difference velocity field shows large differences in the centre of the galaxy , where the hi distribution shows signs of a depression .",
    "the presence of several different sources of perturbations which could lead to non - circular motions makes it difficult to determine a tilted - ring model for the co data .",

    "there is no systematic difference between the hi and co velocity fields in the region where they overlap .",
    "the tilted - ring parameters used to compute the co rotation curve were extrapolated from the tm by assuming a constant value inwards from the innermost point , since there is a central depression of hi .",
    "it was not possible to compute an independent hm model because of the low inclination .",
    "we plot the rotation curve in figure [ fig : all - tm - rotcurs ] .",
    "@xcite did a thorough investigation of the non - circular kinematics in ngc 4736 , solving for inflow and outflow models .",
    "their rotation curve shows the same features as ours , but the velocity that they find at the first maximum is higher than ours by approximately @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite studied ngc 4736 as part of a search for gas radial flows , which was based on the nuga survey .",
    "they used high - resolution observations of the @xmath19 and @xmath18 transitions of co to map the central molecular component .",
    "their rotation curve rises to @xmath34 within @xmath35 , which corresponds to a single beam of the heracles survey .",
    "the rotation curve that we derive rises steeply ( within @xmath36 ) , but the rise is not as steep as the rotation curve derived by @xcite , which could be due to differences in the beam sizes , since the synthesized beam of the plateau du bure is approximately @xmath37 .",
    "ngc 5055 is an sabc galaxy with extended co emission across the optical disk . the hi and co profiles are in good agreement with each other ( figure [ fig : hico - profiles ] ) .",
    "@xcite studied the morphology and kinematics of ngc 5055 in co. ngc 5055 has also been observed as part of the @xcite survey .",
    "we note a good agreement between the _ pv _ diagram and velocity field presented therein , and those presented in this work . in figure [ fig:5055-atlas ]",
    "we plot the hi and co velocity fields and _ pv _ diagrams for ngc 5055 .",
    "the velocity fields appear to be in good agreement , and the difference velocity field shows small amplitudes .",
    "the large difference in the centre of the galaxy is due to a combination of differential beam smearing ( the things and heracles beamsizes are slightly different ) and the difference in morphology between the hi and the co.    the major - axis _ pv _ diagram shows that the hi and co distributions are quite similar - we can thus expect that the hi and co rotation curves show similar features .",
    "the co distribution is sufficient to compute an independent hm rotation curve .",
    "the rotation curves for ngc 5055 are plotted in figure [ fig : all - hm - rotcurs ] .",
    "we also note that @xcite studied co and hi data for ngc 5055 ; the co rotation curve derived in their work ( computed from the bima - song data ) goes out to approximately @xmath38 , and is sufficient to trace the rising part of the rotation curve .    the hi and co rotation curves are in good agreement with each other , with the co rotation velocities being slightly higher ( the differences are within the error - bars and certainly less than about @xmath39 ) than that for the hi within @xmath38 .",
    "ngc 6946 is an sabcd galaxy and has historically been a popular target for co observations .",
    "the co morphology includes a bright nuclear structure and fainter spiral arms .",
    "the nuclear structure was the object of several detailed studies .",
    "there are various studies comparing the distribution and kinematics of different molecules , e.g. , different transitions of co , as in .",
    "ngc 6946 has also been observed as part of the @xcite survey .",
    "we note a good agreement between the _ pv _ diagram and velocity field presented therein , and those presented in this work . in figure [ fig:6946-atlas ]",
    "we plot the hi and co velocity fields .",
    "the low inclination of the co emission is at the limit of what can be modelled using a tilted - ring model .",
    "we therefore use the tm as the estimate of the kinematics , and we compute the rotation curve , which is plotted in figure [ fig : all - tm - rotcurs ] .",
    "@xcite derived rotation curves from high resolution plateau de bure interferometer observations of co @xmath18 and co @xmath19 in a manner very similar to that used in this work , i.e. , velocity field fitting using a tilted - ring model in ` rotcur ` .",
    "their rotation curves show a rapid rise to approximately @xmath40 within @xmath41 , which is well within a single beam of our observations .",
    "even at @xmath42 ( the resolution of heracles ) , our rotation curve predicts a rotational velocity @xmath43 , and only reaches @xmath40 at a radius of approximately @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite attribute the steep rise in the rotation curve to the response of the gas to the inner nuclear bar , which is unresolved in the heracles observations .",
    "ngc 7331 is an sab galaxy . in figure [ fig:7331-atlas ]",
    "we plot the hi and co velocity fields and _ pv _ diagrams .",
    "the hi is distributed in a disk with a central depression .",
    "the co emission is distributed across the extent of the optical disk and overlaps with the hi emission .",
    "the co emission is sufficient to compute an hm rotation curve , which is plotted in figure [ fig : all - hm - rotcurs ] .",
    "performed an in - depth analysis of ngc 7331 , which included simulations of the evolution of the spiral structure of the galaxy .",
    "they derive co @xmath19 and @xmath18 rotation curves , which are not inclination corrected .",
    "the shape of their rotation curve is consistent with the one derived in this work .",
    "they consider the velocities derived in their rotation curve as being lower than the real maximum velocity of the galaxy , due to the presence of molecular gas along the line of sight .",
    "the tilted - ring model explicitly accounts for the disk geometry , and our maximum velocity ( @xmath44 ) is indeed higher than their associated inclination corrected maximum velocity @xmath45 .",
    "following @xcite we fit the analytic expression described in @xcite :      where @xmath47 is the circular velocity at radius @xmath48 ( the rotation curve ) and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are parameters corresponding to the velocity and the scale length at which the rotation curve approaches flatness , respectively .",
    "we use a non - linear least - square algorithm to fit the analytic rotation curves to the co rotation curves presented in this work .",
    "the corresponding best fit values for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are presented in table [ tab : vflat - lflat ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : boissier ] we plot the best fit model rotation curves and the observed co rotation curves derived using the things model .",
    "we do not include the results for ngc 4736 , since the analytic model can not fit a declining rotation curve , by definition .",
