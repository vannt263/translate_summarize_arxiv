    "an elusive goal in electronic structure theory is to achieve a balanced description of dynamical and static correlation effects in a cost - effective manner .",
    "it is widely accepted that , while coupled - cluster theory@xcite ( cc ) has been remarkably successful in capturing accurate dynamical correlation , the use of traditional single - reference ( sr ) methods is an ill - posed route for static correlation.@xcite this is because a reference wave function , e.g. , hartree  fock ( hf ) , is inadequate for strongly correlated systems , and the exponential wave operator @xmath0 in sr - cc has to be improved by including higher excitation ranks , entailing a rapid increase in computational cost .",
    "this difficulty can be ameliorated by adopting some multiconfiguration ( mc ) _ ansatz _ , for which a complete active space self - consistent field@xcite ( casscf ) is widely employed ;",
    "however , the formulation of multireference ( mr)-cc is far less straightforward.@xcite    from this point of view , symmetry - projected hf ( phf ) presents an interesting paradigm,@xcite because its wave function @xmath1 holds an mr structure , but can simultaneously be viewed as an sr method by regarding the projection operator @xmath2 as some kind of propagator acting on a slater determinant @xmath3 . motivated by this observation , we have recently explored alternative paths to handle static correlation using spin - symmetry projected unrestricted hf ( suhf ) as a reference,@xcite a subset of phf that is equivalent to lwdin s spin - extended hf.@xcite the dynamical part of the correlation energy is then treated by either perturbation theory@xcite or configuration interaction ( ci).@xcite among these developments , it was shown that spin - extended ci with single and double substitutions ( ecisd ) can produce accurate results for systems where the static correlation plays an important role . the success of this method is a result of its effective mr - ci nature , which comes from the mc character of suhf .",
    "however , size - consistency and size - extensivity , which are of crucial importance in electronic structure theory,@xcite are both missing from ecisd ( and mr - ci ) as a consequence of the truncated ci . in both sr - ci and mr - ci , the introduction of size - consistent corrections by davidson @xcite and others@xcite",
    "partially mitigates the size - inconsistency error by approximating quadruple excitations.@xcite the generalization of the davidson correction to ecisd ( ecisd+q ) was shown to drastically improve the accuracy of ecisd ; nonetheless , ecisd+q is neither size - extensive nor variational with respect to the ci coefficients .",
    "the lack of the latter property is also troublesome , because the analytical gradient of ecisd+q is not straightforward to compute , hindering the geometric optimization and computation of molecular properties ( i.e. , density matrix).@xcite therefore , it is strongly desired that ecisd be extended such that ( 1 ) size - consistency and size - extensivity are established , and ( 2 ) analytical gradients remain readily available .",
    "this is the purpose of the present work .    to accomplish size - extensive results",
    ", one can resort to a diagrammatic analysis to remove unlinked diagrams , as is routinely practiced in sr methods.@xcite however , the nonorthogonality involved in the spin - projection of suhf poses a challenge , because a vacuum is not well defined ( a problem shared by the mr formalism ) . simply removing the unlinked terms in the resulting ecisd equations",
    "might guarantee the size - extensivity of the method , but in the presence of a projection operator , this task seems particularly difficult .    besides the diagrammatic approach as well as the davidson correction , in conventional electronic structure theory , several authors have modified the regular ci equations in an attempt to approximately cancel out the unlinked terms , retaining only the singles and doubles excitation manifold .",
    "the earliest methods in this spirit include coupled electron pair approximation ( cepa ) , which had been extensively developed in the sr paradigm until the advent of cc theory.@xcite although the accuracy of the sr - cepa methods is by no means inferior to ccsd,@xcite they have lost popularity .",
    "ccsd is a more `` complete '' theory , as it is hierarchically improvable to the full ci ( fci ) limit@xcite and is invariant with respect to the unitary rotation among the occupied space .",
    "however , cepa methods have attracted considerable attention for mr cases , because they are much simpler than mr - cc and a clearly better alternative to mr - ci , generically yielding a reliable description of dynamical correlation .    with these past developments in mind , in the present work , we extend ecisd by adopting cepa - like corrections for unlinked terms within the manifold of spin - projection .",
    "the proposed spin - extended cepa ( ecepa ) is an approximately size - consistent generalization of ecisd , and is thus expected to be more accurate .",
    "it is also considered to be an approximation whose accuracy lies between those of sr- and mr - cepa , as the reference suhf itself falls into the category of mc - scf with far lower computational demands than conventional approaches .",
    "the trade - off is that the obtained energy is no longer the upper bound of the fci energy . in this article",
    ", we will show how such a generalization may be realized within the overcomplete space of projected ci , and will report illustrative calculations to benchmark its performance .",
    "in addition , we will investigate the size - consistent and size - extensive properties using non - interacting be atoms , and demonstrate the improved performance of ecepa over ecisd and ecisd+q .",
    "note that , although ecepa is size - extensive in the sense that the correlation energy correctly scales with the number of electrons , the presence of a projection operator will not , in principle , permit exact size - consistency . while this could certainly limit the application range of ecepa ,",
    "we must stress that spin - projection is routinely applied in kohn ",
    "sham density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) through noodleman s approximation@xcite or yamaguchi s weighted - average approximation,@xcite both of which remove spin - contamination only at first order .",
    "these methods yield encouraging results in various cases,@xcite although it is easy to show that they are not size - consistent in general . from this perspective , while aiming for the same goal as these approximations , our methodology provides a more rigorous approach that is correct to the infinite order of @xmath4 . to this end",
    ", we will compare our method with yamaguchi s scheme in terms of the accuracy of singlet - triplet splitting gaps .",
    "it is shown that ecepa gives encouraging results when approximately spin - projected dft fails .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the theoretical foundation of ecepa in section [ sec : ecepa ] .",
    "we then introduce the concept of pair - energy and propose several size - consistent variants of ecisd in section [ sec : pair - energy ] , analogously to traditional cepa approaches .",
    "section [ sec : open - shell ] deals with open - shell cases , which require some treatment such that ecepa can be successfully reduced to sr - cepa in the no spin - projection limit .",
    "we investigate the numerical performance of ecepa on several test cases in section [ sec : results ] ; investigations include the potential energy curves of bond - breaking molecules ( [ sec : dissociation ] ) , singlet - triplet splitting gaps ( [ sec : st ] ) , hyperfine coupling constants ( [ sec : hfcc ] ) , and cr@xmath5 ( [ sec : cr2 ] ) .",
    "the connection between ecisd+q and ecepa , along with their size - consistent properties , is studied in section [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and outlook for future work in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the projected fci wave function as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the underlying determinant of suhf . by representing combinations of occupied and virtual orbital indices as @xmath8",
    ", the excitation operator @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ci coefficients and excitation operators , respectively .",
    "hereinafter , we use @xmath13 to denote occupied , @xmath14 to denote virtual , and @xmath15 to denote general spin - orbitals ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) . the spin - projected determinants ( @xmath17 ) are not mutually orthogonal , and therefore the projected ci space in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppsi ] ) is overcomplete . as such , @xmath18 is not intermediate - normalized ( we only assume the suhf wave function is normalized ) .",
    "the ci coefficients are usually determined by projecting the schrdinger equation with @xmath19 , or equivalently with @xmath20 , noting that @xmath21 and @xmath22 = 0 $ ] . however , in the following , we reformulate the ecisd equation such that its correlating subspace , spanned by the projected single and double configurations , is modified to restore the size - consistency and size - extensivity , while the reference space is unchanged . hence , we adopt the following projections : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the correlation energy and @xmath25 removes the reference state with @xmath26 although @xmath27 , the commutativity with @xmath28 is not satisfied",
    ". therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ec1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ciequation ] ) constitute a non - hermitian eigenvalue problem , but we emphasize that the resulting coefficients ( and thus energy ) remain exact .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec1 ] ) , the correlation energy is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as will soon become clear , it is convenient to express @xmath24 in the following self - dependent form : @xmath33    ecisd only takes single and double excitations in @xmath9 , and neglects higher excitation effects , which are responsible for size - consistency and size - extensivity . to include such effects approximately",
    ", we consider the projected cc wave function instead of fci : @xmath34 where @xmath9 is truncated at doubles for the present , but @xmath35 generates higher excitations .    in the presence of a spin - projection operator , @xmath36 can generally interact with any @xmath37 including triples and higher excitations .",
    "therefore , the projected ci equations ( eq .  ( [ eq : ciequation ] ) ) and the correlation energy ( eq .  ( [ eq : ec ] ) )",
    "are non - terminating . however , such interactions are expected to be sufficiently weak , and hence we will neglect the hamiltonian and overlap couplings between @xmath38 and @xmath37 when @xmath39 and @xmath40 differ by more than two electrons . the negative consequence associated with this approximation",
    "is assumed to be negligible compared to the expected improvement over ecisd gained by introducing the linked disconnected triples and quadruples , as well as that over spin - unrestricted sr methods by projecting them onto the correct symmetry space .",
    "although there are many disconnected contributions in ccsd because of several powers of @xmath9 , we follow the conventional cepa derivation , which only considers the quadratic contributions.@xcite for this term , we write @xmath41 where we have introduced the resolution of the identity and truncated at doubles in eq .",
    "( [ eq : st1 ] ) , and also removed the terms where neither @xmath42 nor @xmath43 fully coincides with @xmath44 . using the energy expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec ] ) , we have defined the residual contribution @xmath45 as @xmath46 which is dominated by the so - called exclusion - principle - violating ( epv ) term @xmath47 as suggested by its sr limit .",
    "it should be emphasized that it is possible to avoid the introduction of the epv terms by evaluating the matrix elements of the above quadratic contribution rigorously .",
    "however , not only will this treatment entail the derivation of higher - order coupling terms , but the resulting equation will also become nonlinear . this possibility is beyond our current scope and will be addressed in a forthcoming publication . in the present work , therefore , we explore the applicability of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ten1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rnu ] ) as a first step , thus retaining the simplicity of the working equations and as much similarity to both ecisd and conventional cepa as possible .    defining @xmath48 as some non - hermitian operator such that @xmath49 we find , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an effective wave function in the form of cisd expansion .",
    "( [ eq : ecepa ] ) is referred to as the ecepa equation .",
    "the necessity of using @xmath53 instead of @xmath19 should now be even clearer  without the @xmath54 projection , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecepa ] ) would contradict eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec1 ] ) because of the contribution of @xmath55 in @xmath19 .",
    "the ecepa equation is therefore formally similar to the ecisd equation ( eq .  ( [ eq : ciequation ] ) with @xmath56 ) , and is easily cast as a generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "importantly , however , the former is independent of @xmath24 , unlike the latter , which is manifested in the vast majority of unlinked diagrams being canceled out to reduce the size - inconsistency error in the former .",
    "finally , eq .  ( [ eq : ecepa ] ) rigorously reduces to the sr - cepa problem if @xmath57 , which we claim is an important property .      in this section ,",
    "we derive several variants for @xmath58 as formally defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rnu ] ) . in the following , for simplicity",
    ", we discuss the case where @xmath9 is composed of only double excitations . as in the standard cepa variants , it is convenient to introduce pair energies @xmath59 , which divide the correlation energy into the contributions of each electron pair@xcite : @xmath60 given eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec ] ) , our definition of the pair - energy is @xmath61 neglecting the dependence of virtual indices in @xmath45 , as in most regular cepa methods , the epv terms are approximated as @xmath62    we are now ready to set out several variants of cepa with different treatments of eq .",
    "( [ eq : epv ] ) , by analogy of the single reference methods .",
    "if all the epv terms @xmath63 are completely neglected , we obtain a large cancellation between the unlinked terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecepa ] ) .",
    "this is historically called cepa(0),@xcite and is equivalent to linearized cc theory ( lcc).@xcite hence , we will refer to this approximation as elcc . despite a crude approximation",
    ", lcc is known to be more accurate than full cc for some cases.@xcite it is worth noting , however , that elcc is not exact for two - electron systems , adding some nonzero correction to ecisd although the latter is already exact .",
    "one should deal with the epv terms appropriately to recover the exactness for two - electron systems .",
    "the resemblance between pair - energies in sr and spin - projected approaches permits us to introduce ecepa(1 - 3)@xcite :    @xmath64\\\\ & r_{ij}^{ab } = \\epsilon_{ij } , & \\rm [ ecepa(2)]\\\\ & r_{ij}^{ab } = \\epsilon_{ij } + \\sum_{k\\ne i , j }   ( \\epsilon_{ik } + \\epsilon_{kj } ) , & \\rm [ ecepa(3)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that these approximations are not invariant with respect to an orbital rotation among occupied orbitals .",
    "as such an orbital dependence precludes a straightforward derivation of the energy functionals and analytical gradients , we will not consider these approaches further in the present study .    to avoid the orbital dependence in ecepa(1 - 3 ) , we follow gdanitz and ahlrichs in averaging the pair energies.@xcite by partitioning the system into @xmath65 non - interacting electron pairs ( @xmath66 is the number of correlated electrons ) , the average of the pair energies becomes @xmath67 then , the so - called averaged coupled - pair functional ( acpf ) assumes that all epv pairs are approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : acpf]).@xcite meissner suggested a different averaging by considering the actual number of pairs , @xmath68.@xcite the averaged pair - energy in this case becomes @xmath69 szalay and bartlett employed eq .",
    "( [ eq : aqcc ] ) for mr calculations , and derived the averaged quadratic coupled - cluster ( aqcc).@xcite in accordance with these previous developments , we applied these averaging schemes to our ecisd generalization , giving eacpf and eaqcc , respectively",
    ".    the accuracy of these methods can only be assessed by actual calculations . however , as will be argued in section [ sec : results ] , it turns out that eacpf and eaqcc have different advantages and disadvantages .",
    "namely , the acpf parametrization is more accurate when it is stable , but can overestimate the higher excitation effects , whereas that of aqcc is generally more stable at the cost of slight underestimation of dynamical correlation effects .",
    "interestingly , exactly the same observation is made in conventional mr adaptations.@xcite hence , it is indicative that neither eq .  ( [ eq : acpf ] ) nor ( [ eq : aqcc ] ) is conclusive for the average treatment of epv terms . considering that these averaging schemes are themselves approximations to the orbital - dependent epv treatments ecepa(1 ) and ecepa(3),@xcite we also propose a compromised scheme by taking a linear combination as @xmath70 with an empirical parameter @xmath71 . in the following , we set @xmath72 , which was found to provide suitable compensation for the undesired errors in eacpf and eaqcc .",
    "we will refer to this scheme as eaqcc hybrid ( eaqcch ) .",
    "note that eacpf , eaqcc , and eaqcch are all exact for two - electron systems , reducing to ecisd .",
    "finally , we note that there can be redundancy terms in these methods , as in mr - cepa,@xcite arising from the overcompleteness of the projected ci space .",
    "however , such redundancy is completely removed by taking the metric into account .      for open - shell systems that include unpaired electrons , we also follow the treatment of the original acpf and aqcc approaches , so that eacpf and eaqcc coincide with their sr limits whenever @xmath57 . in this subsection",
    ", we will briefly discuss how we achieve this goal .    in both the sr and mr variants ,",
    "the orbital space is divided into three subspaces : doubly - occupied inactive , active ( open - shell for sr ) , and external orbitals . among all possible configurations considered in cisd ,",
    "cluster corrections are not needed for the internal configuration space , where external orbitals remain unoccupied . for the ecepa methods , similarly , we need to define an appropriate internal space to be removed from the epv treatment . here , as in the sr case , we define our internal space to include the reference suhf and the projected configurations that substitute electrons into open - shell orbitals , which can be uniquely identified by diagonalizing the reference density matrix.@xcite removing the internal space in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecepa ] ) guarantees that eacpf and eaqcc can be safely reduced to their original formulations for an rohf reference when no projection operation is carried out .",
    "evidently , this can be accomplished by generalizing @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) , but would formally require the inverse of the overlap matrix @xmath73 within the internal space ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that @xmath75 is easily shown to be _ diagonal _ in the corresponding - pair orbital ( co ) basis .",
    "therefore , instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) , we use @xmath76 note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ eq : generalq ] ) are identical to one another for closed - shell systems .",
    "as mentioned , the above ecepa approximations can be recast as an eigenvalue problem by shifting the hamiltonian matrix in the ecisd equation.@xcite the matrix representation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecepa ] ) is shown to be @xmath77 where @xmath78 the second term is the size - consistent correction that shifts the hamiltonian by @xmath79 under the metric of the projected manifold .",
    "for the averaged models introduced in section [ sec : pair - energy ] , including elcc , the unitary invariance with respect to orbital rotation permits us to define an effective ( total ) energy functional as @xmath80 = \\frac{{\\langle}\\tilde \\psi | \\hat h \\hat { \\cal p } |\\tilde \\psi{\\rangle}- \\zeta e_{\\rm suhf}{\\langle}\\tilde \\psi | \\hat{\\cal p}\\hat{q } |\\tilde\\psi{\\rangle}}{{\\langle}\\tilde \\psi |\\hat { \\cal p } |\\tilde \\psi{\\rangle}- \\zeta { \\langle}\\tilde \\psi|\\hat{\\cal p}\\hat{q}|\\tilde \\psi{\\rangle}},\\label{eq : fc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is a constant depending on the method ; @xmath82 , and @xmath83 for ecisd , elcc , eacpf , and eaqcc , respectively . * c * is variationally determined by minimizing @xmath84 $ ] ; one can easily show that requiring @xmath85/{\\partial}{\\bf c } = { \\bf 0}$ ] results in eq .",

    "size - extensivity is guaranteed because the residual correlation @xmath24 is known to be size - extensive in the sr and mr approaches , even though the correlation energy of suhf ( @xmath86 ) is not .",
    "however , size - consistency is not rigorously satisfied in general , but only for special cases , because of the presence of @xmath2 .",

    "however , the large difference between eacpf and eaqcc in cr@xmath5 demonstrates the limitation of these averaged treatments of the epv terms , as well as the possible inadequacy of suhf as a reference .",

    "<S> we propose a size - consistent generalization of the recently developed spin - extended configuration interaction with singles and doubles ( ecisd ) , where a ci wave function is explicitly spin - projected . </S>",
    "<S> the size - consistent effect is effectively incorporated by treating quadruples within the formulation of coupled electron pair approximation . as in coupled - cluster theory , </S>",
    "<S> quadruple excitations are approximated by a disconnected product of double excitations . despite its conceptual similarity to the standard single- and multireference analogues </S>",
    "<S> , such a generalization requires careful derivation , as the spin - projected ci space is non - orthogonal and overcomplete . </S>",
    "<S> although our methods generally yield better results than ecisd , size - consistency is only approximately retained because the action of a symmetry - projection operator is size - inconsistent . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on simple models where exclusion - principle - violating terms , which eliminate undesired contributions to the correlation effects , are either completely neglected or averaged . </S>",
    "<S> these models possess an orbital - invariant energy functional that is to be minimized by diagonalizing an energy - shifted effective hamiltonian within the singles and doubles manifold . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a straightforward generalization of the ecisd analytical gradients needed to determine molecular properties and geometric optimization . </S>",
    "<S> given the multireference nature of the spin - projected hartree  </S>",
    "<S> fock method , the proposed approaches are expected to handle static correlation , unlike single - reference analogues . </S>",
    "<S> we critically assess the performance of our methods using dissociation curves of molecules , singlet - triplet splitting gaps , hyperfine coupling constants , and the chromium dimer . </S>",
    "<S> the size - consistency and size - extensivity of the methods are also discussed . </S>"
