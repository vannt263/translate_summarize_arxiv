    "floquet topological insulators , a new kind of topological phase , have been attracting much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "these phases are produced by periodically time - dependent hamiltonians . by tuning the amplitude , phase , and frequency of the periodic drive myriad topological phases",
    "may be realized . among floquet topological insulators ,",
    "effective time - reversal breaking floquet chern insulators ( fcis ) have even been experimentally realized in cold - atoms  @xcite and optical wave - guides  @xcite .",
    "these states contain unique @xmath0 edge states that have no equivalent in a static system  @xcite .",
    "however , characterizing a driven system as topological is non - trivial , as the usual adiabatic arguments  @xcite for topological properties can not be applied .",
    "naively , the topological nature of these systems could be deduced by analyzing the ground state of the floquet hamiltonian  @xcite , which we call the `` floquet ground state '' ( fgs ) .",
    "however the fgs has no general connection to the non - equilibrium state realized in experiment , and therefore it can not be used to determine the existence of topological properties .    in this work ,",
    "we study the topological properties of fcis using the entanglement spectrum ( es ) @xcite .",
    "entanglement statistics have already been demonstrated to detect ground states  @xcite , critical states  @xcite , topological states  @xcite , and universal exponents  @xcite .",
    "the es in particular is known to have edge states for topological states that mimic the edge states appearing in the physical boundaries of the same system  @xcite . as",
    "the es is a function of the state of the system at a given time , it may be used to detect topological properties for a time - evolving state .",
    "we calculate the es for four different phases of the fci generated by a sudden turn on of the driving laser both numerically and analytically , and we complement these results with that for a slow turn on of the laser .",
    "we label states obtained this way , i.e. , via unitary time evolution , as physical or true states , and we compare the es of these states with the es of the fgs .",
    "we present three main findings .",
    "first , the es of the fgs correctly detects both the usual and @xmath0-edge states of the system .",
    "second , in the case of a resonant laser , the fgs is qualitatively different from the physical state obtained from unitary time - evolution .",
    "third , the es in the physical resonant state does not show all the expected edge states .",
    "therefore , the system driven by a resonant laser does not have the naively expected topological properties .",
    "these results do not depend on how rapidly the laser was switched because , unlike for an off - resonant laser , for a resonant laser there is no adiabatic limit  @xcite .",
    "we also explicitly show this lack of adiabaticity of the resonant laser via the properties of the es .    in ref .",
    "it was shown that a chern number constructed out of unitarily evolved states is conserved .",
    "thus if the initial state before the periodic drive was turned on had a zero chern number , it would stay zero always .",
    "however , this chern number is a property of the full density matrix and is not related to physical observables directly .",
    "rather , local physical observables probe a local spatial region and therefore a reduced density matrix for which the arguments of ref .   do not hold .",
    "evidence that the chern number of the full density matrix is not relevant also comes from the fact that that unitarily evolved states show a non - zero dc and ac hall conductivity even for an initial state with zero hall conductivity  @xcite , although this conductivity is smaller in magnitude than @xmath1 , as would be expected for the fgs .",
    "thus our result that the es of a unitarily evolved state reflects some of the topological properties of the fgs is consistent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec1 ]",
    "the model is presented , and the topological properties of the fcis of interest to us are summarized . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "the methods for obtaining the es are described , while the results are presented and discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "many details are relegated to the appendices .",
    "other than figure  [ fig : slowfastturnon ] , all other plots are for the sudden quench .",
    "appendix  [ app1 ] contains results for the es for the slow turn on of the laser .",
    "appendix  [ app2 ] gives the bulk occupation probabilities for the quench switch on protocol of the laser , as well as the projections of these occupation probabilities on the translationally invariant axis in order to highlight their relation to the bulk states of the es .",
    "plots showing edge states , their chiralities , and decay lengths in the es for fgs and the unitarily evolved states are given in appendix  [ app3 ] .",
    "a key equation whose solution yields the es is derived in appendix  [ app4 ] , while analytic solutions for the edge states in the es of the dirac model are given in appendix  [ app5 ] , and they help to provide physical intuition for the more complex es structure of the unitarily evolved state in the presence of the laser .",
    "we study the quench from the ground state of graphene at half - filling to a time - periodic hamiltonian corresponding to driving by a circularly polarized laser .",
    "the transport and optical properties following such a quench has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian before the quench is that of a half - filled infinite sheet of graphene , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the n.n .",
    "spacing , and @xmath4 . at @xmath5 , the hamiltonian",
    "is changed by substituting @xmath6 , so that the @xmath7 is now periodically time - dependent .",
    "a state @xmath8 of momentum @xmath9 evolves under this hamiltonian for @xmath10 according to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the initial state and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are periodic in time and given by the floquet - bloch equation @xmath15|a_k(t)\\rangle = 0 ; \\label{eq : floquetbloch}\\ ] ] and likewise for @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 are the two quasi - energies , which are only defined up to integer multiples of @xmath18 .",
    "we take them to lie between @xmath19 calling this range of @xmath17 and @xmath9 the floquet brillouin zone ( fbz ) .",
    "we take @xmath20 .",
    "the information of the initial state is encoded in the overlaps with @xmath3 and @xmath21 and may be quantified by the excitation density @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the occupation probability of the lower floquet band and likewise for @xmath24 .",
    "_ topology _  the wavefunctions at fixed @xmath25 and quasi - energies @xmath17 may be interpreted as the band - structure of some underlying hamiltonian , @xmath26 and we may define a  ground state \" of this hamiltonian by completely filling the lower band @xmath27 it is found that for some choices of parameters , the corresponding hamiltonian has a non - trivial chern number and is therefore topological . as in the static case , the chern number is related to the existence of edge bands  @xcite . in the fci , there are two kinds of edge states : `` conventional '' edges that disperse through @xmath28 and `` anomalous '' @xmath0 edges that disperse through @xmath29 . the chern number is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the difference between the number of left - moving and right - moving conventional ( anomalous ) edge modes .",
    "however , the natural physical question is whether the many - body state generically produced by experiment actually displays any topological properties .",
    "note that despite appearances , there is no reason for the fgs to be produced in a generic experiment . as @xmath32 is periodic , there is no notion of a lowest - energy state and hence no notion of relaxation to a ground state .",
    "in fact , it is believed that generic disorder and interactions cause a driven closed system to reach infinite temperature  @xcite .",
    "therefore we must consider the physical state as determined by time evolution under a reasonable experimental protocol , here a quench , both sudden and slow .",
    "having produced the physical state , we now must decide if it is topological . here",
    "several standard arguments fail .",
    "as the system is time - dependent , there is no good notion of adiabatic flux threading  @xcite .",
    "the application of a physical edge will qualitatively change the evolution of the system and therefore does not provide good information about the system in the absence of such an edge . as the application of generic disorder drives the system to infinite temperature , there is no notion of static localization .",
    "these problems are solved by using the entanglement spectrum ( es )  @xcite .",
    "the es is calculated by imposing a fictitious boundary on the density matrix at a particular time .",
    "the degrees of freedom outside the boundary are traced out , and the spectrum of the reduced density matrix is the es .",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath32 of this matrix lie between @xmath37 and @xmath38 with a value of @xmath37 or @xmath38 representing an unentangled or pure state mode and @xmath39 representing a maximally entangled mode .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we consider four representative phases ( @xmath45 ) of the fci summarized in table  [ tab : phases ] .",
    "the first phase @xmath46 is the simplest case with an off - resonant laser @xmath47 and a single conventional edge mode .",
    "the other three ( @xmath48 ) are for resonant laser frequencies of @xmath49 , where @xmath0 edge states may appear .",
    "@xmath50 has one conventional edge mode and two counter - propagating @xmath0 modes so that the total chern number is 3 .",
    "@xmath51 has a single conventional mode like @xmath46 but is produced by a high - amplitude resonant laser .",
    "finally , @xmath52 is an unusual topological phase where there are two conventional and two @xmath0 modes so that the total chern number is zero .",
    "the occupation of these edge states following the laser quench in a system with boundaries was recently discussed in ref .  .",
    "the occupation probabilities for the infinite system are discussed and plotted in appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "c    we compute the long - time behavior of the es and ee for the four phases @xmath53 .",
    "the time is fixed to be @xmath54 periods for the sudden quench , whereas the results are at non - stroboscopic times for the slow quench ( see appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "the floquet - bloch wave - vectors are computed by expanding eq .   in a finite number of fourier modes and solving the linear system .",
    "the result is used to construct @xmath55 .",
    "we take the entanglement boundary to be the zigzag edge of a strip of width @xmath56 sites so that the momentum @xmath57 along the strip remains a good quantum number .",
    "thus , @xmath55 may be diagonalized at fixed @xmath57 , and the results are plotted in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the results are compared with the es of the fgs    a single statistic that may be calculated from the es is the entanglement entropy , given by @xmath58,\\ ] ] the sum being taken over all eigenvalues . the results for the entropy are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for the fgs and the physical state",
    ".    the fgs state shows area - law scaling , @xmath59 .",
    "this is because the floquet state is the ground state of @xmath60 , which is local and gapped , and such states are known to show area law@xcite .",
    "however the physical state shows volume - law scaling ( @xmath61 ) as is expected of a generic state with ballistically propagating excitations .",
    "this behavior , therefore , does not provide detailed behavior about the phases .",
    "the full es for both states , namely the fgs and the physical state , for phases @xmath53 is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] for the sudden quench and figure  [ fig : slowfastturnon ] in appendix  [ app1 ] for the slow quench .",
    "the figure is symmetric around @xmath62 as a consequence of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "let us first discuss the es for the fgs .",
    "the es shows a bulk of bands clustered near @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with a gap between the two bands .",
    "additionally , there are a small number of bands that disperse through @xmath62 that appear suggestively like chiral edge states .    on comparing with table  [ tab : phases ] , one finds that the number of edge states that cross the gap in the es of the fgs is the same as the chern number .",
    "this means that when anomalous edge states appear , as in phases @xmath63 , the chiralities of the edge states in the es reverses in such a way that the chern number as calculated from the es agrees with the chern number of the phase .",
    "thus for @xmath50 , for example , there are 3 chiral right - movers in the es even though the anomalous modes are left moving at the physical edge",
    ". a similar reversal of chiralities is observed in @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the es `` understands '' that the @xmath0 modes contribute to the chern number with opposite sign .",
    "while the es is a snapshot at a particular time , at other times , the location of the edge states changes , but their number and chirality are maintained so as to preserve the chern number .",
    "thus the phase @xmath52 can show odd behavior due to the fact that it corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "this is highlighted in figure  [ fig : p4ent ] , where within a laser period , the edge - modes can appear with canceling chiralities ( @xmath5 in figure ) , and totally disappear ( @xmath65 in figure ) , both of these cases being consistent with @xmath64 .",
    "next we turn to the es of the physical state . in the off - resonant case @xmath46",
    ", the floquet and quench es generally agree . in the phases",
    "@xmath48 , the two appear drastically different .",
    "while the central crossing at @xmath66 and the gap remain intact , a continuum of eigenvalues that pass through @xmath39 appears in the quench case .",
    "these continua of states cover the region where the two edge states of @xmath50 located at @xmath67 appear in the fgs spectrum and completely cover the gap in @xmath52 .",
    "this picture qualitatively holds for a slow quench .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : slowfastturnon ] , the edge modes that are absent for the sudden quench continue to be absent for a slower quench . in the next section ,",
    "we explain these results .",
    "this behavior of the es may be explained as follows . in the long - time limit",
    ", the contribution to the correlation function @xmath55 of the overlap between the upper and lower bands oscillates as @xmath68 with @xmath69 . as @xmath70",
    ", @xmath71 changes rapidly with @xmath9 when @xmath72 and the overlap terms may be neglected .",
    "straightforward manipulation ( see appendix  [ app4 ] ) then gives @xmath73 where , @xmath74 if the size @xmath56 of the sub - region @xmath75 is taken to infinity , @xmath76 may be diagonalized by fourier transformation , and its eigenvalues may be read off from eq .",
    "as @xmath77 with eigenvectors @xmath78 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore we may think of @xmath79 as a hamiltonian with two bands , where the gap between the two bands is @xmath80 , and the wavefunctions have some topological properties .",
    "note that the smaller the quench - induced excitation density is , the larger is the gap @xmath80 in the es .",
    "the problem of finding the spectrum of @xmath79 at finite but large @xmath56 is then akin to the problem of finding the spectrum of a hamiltonian in a finite geometry .",
    "we expect two kinds of states : bulk states and edge states .",
    "the bulk states should have the `` energies '' , @xmath81 , but where @xmath9 is quantized in the finite direction .",
    "therefore , the `` bulk '' states can be produced by projecting the occupation number onto the @xmath82 plane ( the translationally invariant direction ) ; see figure  [ fig : proj ] in appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "in addition to these bulk states , there may be edge states .",
    "if the floquet bands are topological , that is , if the chern number is non - zero , _ and _ @xmath81 is non - zero , then the topological protection of edge modes of @xmath79 applies and there will necessarily be edge modes in the es .",
    "this property is topological in the sense that a small deformation of the state , which is equivalent to a deformation of @xmath81 and @xmath83 , can not change the net number of edge modes . for the fgs , where @xmath84 by definition , there will exist edge modes that agree with the chern number of the bands .",
    "this also appears to be the case in @xmath46 , where @xmath85 only at isolated points , and the edge modes of the fgs and physical states agree , although perhaps the issue is more delicate when the entanglement cut is very rough so that momentum @xmath57 is not conserved .",
    "that these states are indeed topological can be seen in the numerics .",
    "their number does not scale with @xmath56 and their crossings are not lifted by varying the phase of the driving laser .",
    "moreover , a direct analysis of the wavefunctions associated with the eigenvalues shows that they are chiral and located on the edge .",
    "figures  [ fig : edgef12 ] and  [ fig : edgef34 ] plot the wavefunctions for the edge states for the fgs , while figures  [ fig : edgeq12 ] and  [ fig : edgeq34 ] plot the same for the true state , and figure  [ fig : edgedecay ] highlights the decay length of the edge states .    if @xmath86 , then this is equivalent to a gap closing in the hamiltonian , and topological protection arguments no longer hold .",
    "indeed , we find that the edge states do not coexist with the bulk states in the numerics . since a resonant process will co - occur with a population inversion ( see figure  [ fig13 ] ) , we do not expect edge states to be protected in the resonant case .",
    "further , since @xmath85 precisely where the resonant laser causes band crossings , the resulting edge modes are not robust at all .",
    "indeed , this is what is seen in the phase @xmath50 where the two edge modes seen in the floquet bands at the boundary of the fbz do not appear in the es of the true state .",
    "this is not an artifact of the quench protocol , and similar population inversions appear in the slow turn on of the resonant laser ( see appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "although the edge modes lose topological protection when @xmath86 , there may still be non - protected edge states .",
    "since we study a perfectly clean system with translational invariance in the @xmath87 direction , an edge mode will appear under the much weaker condition that @xmath88 for the same @xmath57 at which the edge mode appears .",
    "therefore , we find that the central mode appears in @xmath50 and @xmath51 even though @xmath81 is zero over a large arc in the bz .",
    "we expect that this edge mode would disappear for other geometries . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the high - amplitude laser produces population inversions throughout the bz , and there are no edge states whatsoever in the physical state . for phase @xmath46 ,",
    "on the other hand , one has a robust gap , with gap closings only at some special points ( rather than large arcs ) .",
    "these excitations can be made even smaller for a slow laser switch on , as for the off - resonant case , an adiabatic theorem can hold .",
    "this provides a complete description of the entanglement spectrum at long times after a floquet quench .",
    "the key quantity that determines the applicability of the chern number calculation to the edge modes of the quench is the population difference @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to ask how the results of the es compare with physical observables . in ref .",
    ", the occupation of the edge states in a system with boundaries was studied , and it was found that the edge state for the off - resonant case @xmath46 was occupied at a low effective temperature .",
    "in contrast , only one set of edge modes in the phase @xmath50 was occupied at a low effective temperature , while the two new sets of @xmath0-edge modes appearing due to resonant band crossings were occupied at a high effective temperature and coexisted with bulk excitations . the dc conductivity for these phases",
    "was studied in ref .  , where it was found that the conductance was very close to the maximum , @xmath89 , for @xmath46 , and it persisted at this value for @xmath50 even though new edge modes appear for @xmath50 .",
    "this observation implies that the high effective temperature of the resonant edge modes prevent them from contributing much to transport , in contrast to the off - resonant edge mode .",
    "thus our results show that the study of the es is a useful way to understand the topological properties of a periodically driven system .",
    "an important direction of research would be to extend this analysis to interacting floquet topological insulators .",

    "de - sc0010821 .",
    "to generate occupation probabilities for the slowly turned on laser , the schrdinger equation at fixed @xmath57 is solved by implementing the commutator free exponential time method following ref .  .",
    "the occupation probabilities and entanglement spectrum are calculated from these wavefunctions . due to the computational cost of this procedure",
    ", the system width was taken to be @xmath90 sites .",
    "the results for the es shown in figure  [ fig : slowfastturnon ] , are in qualitative agreement with the quench protocol discussed in the body of the paper .",
    "band inversions appear near momenta where the laser is resonant with the band gap .",
    "these band inversions are accompanied by a high bulk excitation density , leading to a closing of the entanglement gap , and ruining the topological protection of edge states .",
    "figure  [ fig : slowfastturnon ] shows data for two different laser switch - on rates for the two resonant phases @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath50 has three pairs of chiral edge states in the ground state ( fgs ) of the floquet hamiltonian .",
    "however , we find that for all switch - on rates of the laser , two of the three pairs of edge states ( located at @xmath92 ) are absent from the es of the unitarily evolved states . only the central edge state located at @xmath66 survives .    for phase @xmath51",
    ", there is only one pair of chiral edge states in the floquet ground state , and this is visible in the es of all the unitarily evolved states as well .",
    "however this edge state coexists with bulk excitations that survive both for a fast and slow laser quench .",
    "paradoxically , a slower laser switch on creates more bulk excitations when the laser frequency is resonant .",
    "we understand this as follows .",
    "a large - amplitude laser can modify the band structure considerably , making the bands flatter .",
    "thus a resonant laser can become effectively off - resonant when the amplitude of the laser becomes too large .",
    "thus when a laser amplitude is switched on slowly , ( while its frequency is kept unchanged ) , since for a longer period the effective amplitude of the laser is smaller for a slower switch on than a faster switch on , more resonant excitations are created for the slower switch on as the resonance condition is obeyed for a longer duration of time . that is the reason why in figure  [ fig : slowfastturnon ] , there are more bulk excitations for the slower switch on than for the faster switch on .",
    "the only reason why the central edge state at @xmath66 is unaffected by these bulk excitations is because our entanglement cut is smooth and momentum @xmath57 is conserved .",
    "this prevents hybridization between the central edge state and the bulk excitations , since the latter are located at other values of @xmath57 .",
    "however a rough entanglement cut will wipe out even this central edge state .",
    "the occupation probabilities of the floquet bands for phases @xmath94 are shown in figure  [ fig : drhop12 ] , and those for the phases @xmath95 are shown in figure  [ fig : drhop34 ] . except for @xmath46 ,",
    "all the phases correspond to a resonant laser .    for @xmath46 ,",
    "the quasi - energy of the floquet hamiltonian is similar in appearance to static graphene with the important modification of becoming gapped at k and k. thus , the occupation probabilities follow intuitively from the static picture , and the sharp spikes in figure  [ fig : drhop12 ] correspond to excitations around the k and k points .",
    "the laser being off - resonant is equivalent to the statement that the periodicity of the quasi - energy does not play a role since corresponding boundaries in the fbz are far from the maximum and minimum of the bands .",
    "both @xmath91 have lasers of the same frequency , but the amplitude of the laser for @xmath51 is larger than that for @xmath50 . in @xmath50 there is a population inversion at @xmath96 in addition to the excitations at k and k. this is simply the resonance condition , as now the frequency of the laser is such that it connects the peak and trough of the static graphene bands . in the quasi - energy picture",
    ", this translates to the original static bands extending beyond the fbz and thus forming quasi - energy bands that avoid one another and bend away at the boundary of the fbz .",
    "a large amplitude laser modifies the effective band structure to such a degree that a resonant laser becomes effectively off - resonant .",
    "the bands are drawn toward the center of the fbz , away from the boundaries .",
    "it is for this reason that @xmath51 has fewer bulk excitations than @xmath50 , despite the two phases sharing the same laser frequency .",
    "the flattening of the bands explains the broadening of the excitations at the k and k points .    for phase @xmath51",
    ", even though the laser is resonant , the excitation density around @xmath66 , where the central edge mode in the es appears , is still fairly low .",
    "the laser creates pockets of excitations in regions symmetrically located around the central edge mode .",
    "momentum conservation prevents the central edge mode from mixing with these pockets of bulk excitations .",
    "the amplitude of the laser for @xmath97 is much larger than all the other phases , and its frequency is much smaller as well . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath52 phase is highly excited , with the two floquet bands being almost equally occupied .",
    "figure  [ fig : proj ] is the projection of the occupation probabilities onto the @xmath93 axis .",
    "these projections are generated by selecting constant @xmath98 slices of the occupation probabilities that correspond to the modes that satisfy the boundary conditions of the strip .",
    "these slices are then superimposed on top of one another to give the projection image .    as explained in the main text",
    ", these projected plots reproduce the bulk states of the es .",
    "there are some small discrepancies between the projection plot and the true spectrum .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig4 ] , the bulk excitations on either side of the central edge state in the quenched @xmath50 phase are smooth , but the analogous bands constructed from figure  [ fig : proj ] appear ragged and cross @xmath99 , where they do not in the former .",
    "we explain this difference below .    as the width",
    "is increased , we first expect the bulk excitation bands of the es to take on the rough appearance as predicted in the projection plot .",
    "the larger width will also lead to more bands coalescing towards @xmath39 .",
    "thus in the very large limit , we expect a continua of excitations on both sides of the central edge state of the quenched @xmath50 phase .",
    "the reason for the differing appearances in the large , but not extreme width limit is due to the bulk bands having residual knowledge of the edges and thus undergoing a smoothening and repulsion procedure , as one expects for perturbations .",
    "thus as the width is increased , this smoothening will diminish and bands from both figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig : proj ] will agree .",
    "the reason the repulsion argument does not extend to the edge states is precisely due to their local nature and exponentially small overlap .    in the @xmath51 phase ,",
    "@xmath98 projections originate from occupation probabilities that have a relatively smooth structure throughout the fbz , as seen in figure  [ fig : drhop34 ] .",
    "thus we do not run into this problem for the @xmath51 phase because the projection already creates a continuum that agrees with the spectrum in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "however , for the @xmath50 phase , the probability occupations have sharp , nearly vertical transitions that lead to discrete bands that single out and amplify this otherwise small feature .",
    "the continuum of excitations will only be created by the projection plot for @xmath50 if the strip width is so large that the spacing between @xmath98 states is narrow enough to allow for many states to be selected along the cliff faces ( see figure [ fig : drhop12 ] ) found in the occupation probability of the @xmath50 phase .",
    "the entanglement spectrum for phase @xmath52 is shown in figure  [ fig : p4ent ] .",
    "the floquet state shows the behavior expected of a @xmath64 floquet chern insulator .",
    "the `` bulk '' bands are clustered around @xmath28 and @xmath100 .",
    "there are edge states seen around @xmath39 , however these do not have a net chirality .",
    "this can be seen either from direct inspection of the wavefunctions in figure  [ fig : edgef34 ] , or by noting that the edge states do not connect with the bulk bands .",
    "therefore , these edge states are not topologically protected , and they should disappear under disorder .",
    "in fact figure  [ fig : p4ent ] shows that the edge states appear at certain times in the laser cycle , and they disappear for certain other times .",
    "this does not happen for phases @xmath46 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ; when probed at times away from an integer number of laser periods , the precise location of the edge states is shifted in the es , but the results for the number and chirality of the edge states that are visible remain the same .",
    "the true quench state for phase @xmath52 does not show any edge states , and the bulk bands approximately fill the space ( see figure in main text ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the occupation number difference shown in figure  [ fig : drhop34](b ) , which is found to vary widely between @xmath101 and @xmath38 and crosses @xmath37 on large arcs through the bz . from the perspective of the entanglement and occupation number , therefore , the true quench state for @xmath52 appears similar to a thermal state .",
    "the amplitudes of the edge states are shown in figures  [ fig : edgef12 ] ,  [ fig : edgef34 ] for the floquet ground state , and in figures  [ fig : edgeq12 ] ,  [ fig : edgeq34 ] for the true state . to be clear , by  state \" we mean the eigenvector of the correlation matrix @xmath102 .",
    "as discussed in the main text , we expect these edge states , at least for the floquet ground state , to behave as the usual edge states of a topological hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the states are highly localized to the edge with a decay length on the order of one lattice site .",
    "moreover , we can directly verify the chirality of the edge states by analyzing how the wavefunctions vary with momentum @xmath57 .",
    "in figures  [ fig : edgef12 ] ,  [ fig : edgef34 ] ,  [ fig : edgeq12 ] ,  [ fig : edgeq34 ] the two states with @xmath32 closest to @xmath62 are shown .",
    "the higher @xmath103 state - analogous to the higher energy state - is colored dark while the lower state ( @xmath104 ) is colored light . as can be seen at @xmath57 near the crossing point ,",
    "the edge states are well defined and localized on opposite edges . moreover , at the crossing , the high @xmath32 state switches with its counterpart .",
    "this is expected in a chiral edge because the two bands cross as @xmath57 is varied .",
    "therefore , by analyzing the pattern of switching , the chirality of the bands stated in the main text can be verified .    as an example of this analysis we consider the @xmath105 edge in figure  [ fig : edgef12 ] for the fgs of phase @xmath50 .",
    "we see a pattern of black to gray for all three crossings , which indicates that all the downward arching bands in figure  [ fig4 ] correspond to chiral edges that reside on the @xmath106 edge of the strip .",
    "the edge states corresponding to the downward trending bands at each crossing will be termed  left movers \" and the upward arching bands will be termed ",
    "right - movers \" .",
    "thus , by the same analysis , the @xmath107 edge is found to contain all right movers at each crossing .",
    "the same can be done for the fgs of the @xmath52 phase to verify the assignment of @xmath108 .",
    "both sides contain two crossings of both types , black to gray and gray to black .",
    "thus each side contains an equal number of left movers and right movers .",
    "note that these edge states vanish altogether at other times during the laser period , as pointed out in figure  [ fig : p4ent ] .",
    "in contrast , for all other phases with @xmath109 , the edge - states slightly shift their @xmath57 positioning in a periodic manner .",
    "figures  [ fig : edgeq12 ] ,  [ fig : edgeq34 ] contain states corresponding to @xmath32 near @xmath62 for the unitarily evolved system .",
    "these figures show that unlike the fgs , not all the states at this eigenvalue are edge states .",
    "while phase @xmath46 is similar to the fgs , for phases @xmath91 only one pair of edge modes exist , with a large fraction of states around @xmath110 being bulk states .    the decay of the edge states is shown in figure  [ fig : edgedecay ] .",
    "the decay lengths of the edge states are determined by the inverse of the entanglement gap , which is controlled by the bulk excitation density .",
    "thus @xmath46 which has few bulk excitations in the quenched state has a similar decay length to the fgs .",
    "in contrast , since the quenched state of @xmath51 has more bulk excitations , it shows a longer decay length than the edge state of the fgs .",
    "the surviving edge state of @xmath50 in the quenched state has a similar decay length as the fgs because , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , in the vicinity of this edge state the entanglement gap of the quenched state is almost the same as that of the fgs .",

    "generally , the correlation matrix is given by @xmath111,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 and likewise for @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is the initial state .",
    "we make the assumption that the third and fourth off - diagonal terms proportional to the exponential vanish at long times because of the rapidly varying phase .",
    "we emphasize that this is an acceptable assumption because we are considering @xmath35 to be restricted to a sub region of the lattice . for general @xmath35",
    "the stationary phase approximation implies that the exponentials will contribute in a region where @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the group velocity of the floquet dispersion .",
    "therefore , as long as we consider times that are much larger than @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is some characteristic velocity , we may neglect the oscillating terms .",
    "we have also checked the validity of our argument from the numerical results .",
    "we should mention that the order of limits here does not commute .",
    "the limit @xmath119 must be taken before width @xmath120 .",
    "physically this corresponds to only analyzing the interior of the light - cone .",
    "if we neglect these off - diagonal terms , we obtain @xmath121.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now employing @xmath122 from the completeness of the basis , and the fact that @xmath123 , we obtain the stated equation where we identify @xmath124 .",
    "before we discuss the es , let us review how edge states appear in the physical boundaries of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian in a semi - infinite geometry with a boundary at @xmath106 is , @xmath125 + m(x)\\sigma_z.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the boundary is controlled by the behavior of @xmath126 .",
    "we may write the eigenstate as @xmath127 , which should obey @xmath128 + m(x)\\sigma_z\\biggr)\\psi_k(x , y ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & = e_k\\psi_k(x , y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and implies the eigenvalue equation , @xmath129\\chi + v_f k_y \\sigma_y \\chi    = e_k \\chi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution is @xmath130 , @xmath131 . thus the eigenstate is , @xmath132 the above is an edge state with a decay length controlled by @xmath133 .",
    "now let us consider how edge states emerge in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "for this , we will consider a spatially uniform system ( @xmath134 ) with eigenstates , @xmath135 it is convenient to define @xmath136 where the correlation function in real space is @xmath137 for any generic state , be it one generated at long times after a quench when dephasing has set in , or a mixed state at finite temperature , we may write , @xmath138 we will assume the system to be at half - filling .",
    "note that since , @xmath139 , a filled band will give , @xmath140 the above corresponds to an unentangled product state with eigenvalues of the correlation matrix being @xmath38 .",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath141 is a matrix with eigenvalues @xmath142 .",
    "we write @xmath143 , where @xmath144 are pure states .",
    "since we are interested in the es of a semi - infinite geometry ( @xmath145 ) , we may study the @xmath57 fourier component of @xmath44 in the translationally invariant @xmath87 direction , @xmath146 note that the above correlation matrix is @xmath147 added to the fourier transform of @xmath148 times a matrix with eigenvalues @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , in the infinite system limit it has eigenvalues @xmath149 corresponding to plane - waves eigenvectors . in the presence of a boundary",
    "we expect some linear combinations of these plane waves to form extended scattering states .",
    "the boundary is now determined by the entanglement cut at @xmath106 , rather than @xmath126 .      if @xmath152 and smoothly varying around @xmath93 , we may approximate it by it s value at @xmath82 .",
    "this may then be pulled out of the integral . then using the fact that @xmath153 and",
    "since @xmath154 decays exponentially away from @xmath106 , this term can be replaced by a delta - function , @xmath155 .",
    "thus , @xmath156,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to terms which are higher order in derivatives . note that if @xmath157 the second term vanishes and @xmath44 is controlled by the higher order terms which will not generically have edge states .",
    "this is solved by the same ansatz as for the usual physical edge mode of the dirac hamiltonian , @xmath160 where , @xmath161 and the step function to explicitly impose the boundary conditions .",
    "the entanglement eigenvalues are , @xmath162 in particular this shows that the edge state with @xmath39 exists at @xmath163 , and it disperses linearly with @xmath57 about this point .",
    "now we return to the assumption we made that @xmath164 . if @xmath165 were to hold at some point in @xmath98 , then there would be an extended state with @xmath166 . as this extended state , and edge mode ,",
    "both have equal @xmath57 momentum , and the same eigenvalue under @xmath44 , we expect them to mix . therefore , in this case expanding around @xmath82 is not valid , the argument above does not hold , and we do not expect edge states .",
    "while this analytic argument was shown for the dirac model , and the floquet chern insulator is far more complicated , especially for large chern numbers , yet we find that the same principles apply .",
    "for example figure  [ fig13 ] shows how @xmath167 varies along @xmath98 for the @xmath50 phase .",
    "we have chosen @xmath168 which coincides with the edge mode in the es of the floquet eigenstate that is located to the left of the central edge mode ( see figure [ fig4 ] ( b ) in main text ) .",
    "this particular edge mode is absent in the true wavefunction .",
    "the reason now is clear .",
    "figure [ fig13 ] shows that @xmath169 vanishes at two points in @xmath98 , implying extended states with the same energy as the edge state .",
    "these extended and edge states can now mix , resulting in the absence of the edge state at @xmath170 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the resonant laser results in a rather precise location of the vanishing of @xmath81 relative to the avoided band crossings of the upper and lower floquet bands .",
