    "even though there is ample observational evidence that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating @xcite , there is still no convincing theoretical model that can explain the observations .",
    "the simplest model in agreement with the data is the cosmological constant .",
    "however , it suffers from size and coincidence problems .",
    "in addition , it is likely that an earlier phase of accelerated expansion happened that was not due to a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this period , inflation , is normally modeled as being due to a scalar field .",
    "the same basic mechanism can explain the dark energy , and is often called quintessence in this context @xcite .",
    "scalar field dark energy is often employed to model a general equation of state @xmath2 , although one can also build a perfect fluid with exactly the same first order perturbations @xcite .    over the last few years",
    "it has become clear that @xmath3 alone is not sufficient to distinguish between different models explaining the dark energy , and that the perturbations induced by the dark energy constitute a complementary probe @xcite .",
    "the contribution of dark energy fluctuations to the perturbation dynamics is generally small and can be very difficult to measure . in a recent paper some of us derived theoretical approximations to the perturbations generated in scalar field dark energy models @xcite . in this paper , we will use these expressions to investigate how two cosmological probes that will be of great importance in the future , weak lensing ( wl ) and the full galaxy power spectrum , can be used to measure the typical features that appear in such models , specifically the existence of a sound horizon . exploiting the advantage of analytical approximations , we will try to isolate in some detail where the signal comes from .    anticipating the conclusion ,",
    "we will show that even a full sky , tomographic , deep redshift and imaging survey can not constrain significantly the sound speed of the dark energy unless it is smaller than , roughly , 0.01@xmath1 denotes the speed of light , and in the rest of the paper we will use units so that @xmath4 . ] .",
    "small values of @xmath5 are not compatible with a scalar field description with standard kinetic term and require extensions like k - essence @xcite but are in general not forbidden : we will show that even with @xmath6 , dark energy , although `` cold '' , remains much less clustered than dark matter and will not develop non - linearities by the present time .",
    "the special case of @xmath7 has some additional attractive features , in that such models can cross @xmath8 @xcite and can act as unified models of dark energy and dark matter @xcite ( but are also subject to the `` dark degeneracy '' @xcite ) . for such extreme cases",
    "however dark energy becomes non linear along with dark matter and appropriate non - linear corrections are needed , especially for the weak lensing probe .",
    "the sound speed of the dark energy could be measured also by other effects , like the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , either on the cmb or cross - correlated with large - scale structure . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the cmb isw tail can put a lower limit to @xmath9 , while @xcite finds that @xmath10 is actually favored by the wmap 3-year data .",
    "the isw is complementary to the probes we consider here since it is sensitive to perturbations on larger scales .    as in @xcite",
    "we set the anisotropic stress of the dark energy to zero , which is appropriate for scalar field dark energy and in general for standard gravity models . in order to investigate more general cases , for example modifications of general relativity",
    ", a non - zero anisotropic stress would have to be taken into account @xcite , but this is left for future work .",
    "in detail , the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by discussing the main results obtained in @xcite .",
    "we then use these results to study the impact of the scalar field dark energy perturbations on the weak lensing signal and on probes of galaxy clustering , paying special attention to whether the presence of a sound horizon can be detected ( by measuring the sound speed @xmath9 ) .",
    "we also discuss which aspect of these probes are most sensitive to the perturbations .",
    "we finally investigate constraints on the integrated deviation from the poisson equation , which we call @xmath11 , which may be useful to quantify the power of probes beyond the conventional , @xmath3-based figure of merit used by the dark energy task force @xcite .",
    "in this section we define our notation and present a short discussion of the perturbation equations and the approximate analytical solution of @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper ( and citations therein ) for more details .      in the following",
    ", the dots will refer to the derivatives with respect to the conformal time @xmath12 which is related to the universal time @xmath13 by @xmath14 .",

    "this expression implies that we limit ourselves to a flat universe which is filled with matter ( designated by a subscript @xmath17 ) and a general fluid with average pressure @xmath18 . in general the equation of state parameter @xmath3",
    "is a function of time , but we will take it to be constant later on",
    ".    we will consider linear perturbations about this spatially - flat background model , defined by the line element : @xmath19.\\label{pert_newton_ds}\\ ] ] as is apparent from the line element , we use the conformal newtonian ( longitudinal ) gauge and retain only scalar perturbations .",
    "the perturbation equations for a dark energy fluid with sound speed @xmath5 and parameter of state @xmath3 are : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a measure of the velocity perturbation , @xmath22 is the density contrast , and the prime here means the derivative with respect to the scale factor @xmath23 .",
    "we parameterize the pressure perturbation as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the adiabatic sound speed and @xmath9 is the sound speed in the rest - frame of the dark energy fluid . as already mentioned , we assume that the parameter of equation of state @xmath3 stays constant so that @xmath26 .",
    "we also assume a vanishing anisotropic stress @xmath27 as is the case for quintessence and k - essence models , and therefore we have @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the gravitational potential can be found with the help of the einstein equations , @xmath29      if the universe is perfectly matter dominated , then @xmath30 is a constant . in @xcite",
    "we used this result to derive analytical solutions to the perturbation equations for dark energy in different limits :    * * scales larger than the sound horizon . *",
    "the modes larger than the sound horizon are found for @xmath31 . in this case , we neglect all terms containing the sound speed in eq .",
    "( [ vp ] ) and then in eq .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) , effectively setting @xmath32 . neglecting a decaying solution for which @xmath33",
    "we find : @xmath34 * * scales smaller than the sound horizon . * for modes smaller than the sound horizon , @xmath35 ,",
    "we consider only the terms containing @xmath36 .",
    "we find that the density perturbations become constant and that the velocity perturbations decay : @xmath37    in these equations , the factor @xmath38 sets the overall scale of the perturbations , chosen so that the matter perturbations are @xmath39 on sub - horizon scales .",
    "in addition , the dark energy perturbations depend on their present density fraction ( equal to @xmath40 since the universe is taken to be flat ) but only through the combination @xmath41 , the equation of state parameter @xmath3 and the sound speed @xmath9 .",
    "they are a function of both scale @xmath42 and scale factor @xmath23 .",
    "let us quickly compare dark energy and dark matter fluctuations . for large scales the dominant term in eq .",
    "( [ desolsmallsubfull ] ) is the term containing @xmath42 .",
    "dark matter has a similar solution except that @xmath43 ; the ratio of the squares ( i.e. the power spectrum ratio ) for large scales then will be : @xmath44 if @xmath45 .",
    "however , for small scales ( but still larger than @xmath46 ) , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ desolsmallsubfull ] ) dominates ; in this case the ratio is : @xmath47 the dark energy perturbations are thus always suppressed relative to the dark matter perturbations , even for a very low sound speed ( note that the solution eq .",
    "( [ desolsmallsubfull ] ) was obtained assuming @xmath32 ) .    for the forecasts of this paper",
    ", it is important to know whether we have to worry about non - linear effects : the non - linear clustering of dark energy models is still badly understood and may depend on the precise action of the model , and it is not clear what corrections we would need to apply . outside the sound horizon , the dark energy perturbation track those in the dark matter by the factors given above . these are roughly upper limits as @xmath48 is at the upper limit of what is still allowed , and values of @xmath3 closer to @xmath49 will lead to smaller dark energy perturbations . if @xmath6 the sound horizon at the present is of the order of @xmath50 . on these scales",
    "dark matter fluctuations are still linear and therefore dark energy fluctuations are safely below the non - linearity threshold . on sub - sound - horizon scales ,",
    "dark energy perturbations stop growing and become quickly negligible relative to the dark matter perturbations . if @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath51 then the dark energy will behave much like dark matter on the cluster scales and an appropriate non - linear correction would be needed , especially on the small scales probed by weak lensing ( the small scale cut - off in the galaxy clustering safely excludes non linear scales ) .",
    "therefore we do not extend our analysis to such small sound speeds ; we include however for completeness the extreme case @xmath7 , for which we assume that we can apply the same non - linear correction as for the dark matter  whether this is acceptable may in general depend on the precise action of the field .",
    "in this section we discuss the effect of dark energy clustering on the galaxy and weak lensing probes . we derive approximate analytical expressions that show how the relevant quantities change with the sound speed .",
    "this will help understanding qualitatively the numerical results of the next section .",
    "matter domination was a necessary ingredient to derive the solutions given above .",
    "however , dark energy comes to dominate eventually , and then the potential starts to decay and the perturbations grow more slowly or start to decrease .",
    "it is difficult to capture this behavior accurately .",
    "a way around this problem can be found by looking at the variable @xmath53 which we introduced in @xcite to describe the change of the gravitational potential due to the dark energy perturbations .",
    "@xmath52 is defined through @xmath54 if the dark energy or modification of gravity does not contribute to the gravitational potential ( for example if the dark energy is a cosmological constant ) then @xmath55 .",
    "otherwise @xmath52 will deviate from unity , and in general it is a function of both scale and time .",
    "introducing the comoving density perturbation @xmath56 , we can write @xmath57 we neglect radiation in this paper as we are interested in observational tests at late times where it is subdominant .",
    "then @xmath52 is defined as @xmath58 using simply the solution for the perturbations during matter domination , as discussed in the previous paragraph , we find that the resulting expression for @xmath52 is surprisingly accurate even at late times .",
    "the reason is that both fluids , dark energy and matter , respond similarly to the change in the expansion rate so that most of the deviations cancel .",
    "we find that the sub - soundhorizon expression below is accurate at the percent level , while on larger scales there are deviations of about 10 to 20% by today ( depending on @xmath3 ) .",
    "the latter can be corrected `` by hand '' in order to obtain a more precise formula , but the expressions are sufficiently accurate for our purposes and we keep them as they are .    as we have set the anisotropic stress to zero , the perturbations are fully described by @xmath52 . in @xcite",
    "we provided the following explicit expression for the @xmath59 which captures the behavior for both limits ( above and below the sound horizon ) : @xmath60 here we used @xmath61 which we defined through @xmath62 so that @xmath63 counts how deep a mode is inside the sound horizon .",
    "we see that during matter domination ( used in the first expression for @xmath63 ) a @xmath42 mode moves ever more deeply inside the sound horizon as @xmath23 grows , which is of course no surprise .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qdef3 ] ) we see that the deviation of @xmath52 from @xmath64 depends on the ratio of the energy density of the dark matter and the dark energy , and on the relative amount of perturbations .",
    "the former scales as @xmath65 for a constant @xmath3 and the latter behaves as discussed in the last section . for @xmath66 and @xmath48",
    "we have that @xmath67 on scales that are larger than the sound horizon , @xmath68 .",
    "this is not a negligible deviation today , but it decreases rapidly as we move into the past , as the dark energy becomes less important .",
    "as a scale enters the sound horizon , @xmath69 grows with one power of the scale factor slower ( since @xmath70 stops growing ) , suppressing the final deviation roughly by the ratio of horizon size to the scale of interest . in the observable range , @xmath71 . therefore if @xmath72 , @xmath73 and the dependence on @xmath5 is lost .",
    "this shows that @xmath52 is sensitive to @xmath5 only for small values , @xmath74 .",
    "we can characterize the dependence of @xmath52 on the main perturbation parameter @xmath9 by looking at its derivative , a key quantity for fisher matrix forecasts : @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( with the last expression being for @xmath48 ) . for the values we are interested here , this derivative has a peak just inside the sound horizon , the exact position is @xmath77^{1/4 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] today the sound horizon is given by @xmath78 .",
    "it lies in the observable range of @xmath42 for sound speeds of the order of @xmath79 .",
    "we plot the derivative as the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : der - g - q - b - p0-ink ] , there and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qdercs ] ) we can see that the shape is basically proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath9 ( instead of @xmath81 ) contains an additional factor of @xmath82 which means that it will be boosted by several orders of magnitude for small sound speeds .",
    "we will later forecast how well the deviation of @xmath52 from @xmath64 due to the dark energy perturbations can be measured by future cosmological surveys .      in the @xmath84cdm model of cosmology , the dark matter perturbations on sub - horizon scales grow linearly with the scale factor @xmath23 during matter domination . during radiation domination",
    "they grow logarithmically , and also at late times , when dark energy starts to dominate , their growth is suppressed .",
    "it is well known that in @xmath84cdm the growth factor can be expressed as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is called the growth index .",
    "there are two ways to influence the growth factor : firstly at background level , with a different hubble expansion .",
    "secondly at perturbation level : if dark energy clusters then the gravitational potential changes because of the poisson equation , and this will also affect the growth rate of dark matter .",
    "all these effects can be included in the growth index @xmath83 and we therefore expect that @xmath83 is a function of @xmath3 and @xmath9 ( or equivalently of @xmath3 and @xmath52 ) .    according to @xcite , the growth index depends on dark energy perturbations ( through @xmath52 ) as @xmath87 where @xmath88 however , dark energy perturbations ( hence @xmath52 ) are difficult to measure at least if the dark energy has a very low sound speed .",
    "the growth index factor seems to be a more promising parameter and several experiments are planned to measure this quantity .",
    "furthermore , we can invert eq .",

    "( [ eq : q - gamma ] ) becomes : @xmath91.\\label{eq : q - gamma-1}\\ ] ] if we are dealing with the cosmological constant then we have the expected result of @xmath92 . however ,",
    "if @xmath93 then we can evaluate the corresponding value of @xmath52 ; for instance , if @xmath48 then we have @xmath94 , which is a positive number . however , this value is fairly big for dark energy perturbations , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , for non - phantom models the quantity @xmath69 is always positive due to the relative increase of dark energy perturbations and the @xmath95 factor ; let us remind the reader that if the anisotropic stress is set to zero then @xmath52 fully describes the evolution of dark energy perturbations ; so , we can think to rephrase the sentence as : if @xmath96 which @xmath83 can we reach ?",
    "setting eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - gamma ] ) positive we have @xmath97 which sets a sort of upper bound to @xmath83 ; moreover , this is the limit we have if dark energy perturbations are set to zero ( which can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - q ] ) ) .    in general we can say that if the anisotropic stress is zero then dark energy perturbations always decrease the value of the growth index .",
    "if we want to allow for perturbations in the dark energy sector while increasing at the same time the growth index then we need a non zero anisotropic contribution ; this is the case for the dgp model ( treated as an effective dark energy perturbations , see @xcite ) where @xmath98 .",
    "let us also consider the derivative of @xmath99 with respect @xmath9 to gain an idea of how strongly the growth factor depends on sound speed , and thus on the characteristics of the dark energy perturbations : @xmath100 we can see more clearly the dependence on the parameters by noting that the quantity @xmath101 can be approximated as @xmath102 for @xmath103 close to unity ( we use however the exact expressions in the calculations below ) .",
    "eq.([eq : dg - dcs ] ) then reads : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a constant during matter domination ( the value of @xmath106 today ) .",
    "we first consider two different limits    * @xmath107 ( sub - sound horizon regime ) : @xmath108 * @xmath109 ( super - sound horizon regime ) : @xmath110    both of these derivatives , like the one of @xmath52 discussed further above , have a strong dependence on the sound speed .",
    "as before , the peak location is near the sound horizon , and again the derivative with respect to @xmath9 adds an additional @xmath82 factor so that small sound speeds will lead to much larger values of the derivative .    the numerical factor ( including the @xmath3 dependence )",
    "is @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we also notice that the first limit does not depend on @xmath69 like the derivative @xmath52 , but on @xmath113 as it is an integral .",
    "the growth factor is thus not directly probing the deviation of @xmath52 from unity , but rather how @xmath52 evolves over time .",
    "this is similar in the second limit , except that we probe the evolution of @xmath114 .",
    "we can find a unified formula which accounts for both regimes :    @xmath115}{\\left(1 - 3w\\right)\\left(q - q_{0}\\right)-\\left(1 + 3w\\right)\\left[\\left(q-1\\right)x-\\left(q_{0}-1\\right)x_{0}\\right]}\\label{eq : gdercs - union}\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are evaluated at @xmath118 .",
    "the derivative is shown as the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : der - g - q - b - p0-ink ] .",
    "just as the @xmath52 derivative , the @xmath119 derivative peaks close to the sound horizon , but is smaller than the one of @xmath52 at this redshift .",
    "it grows however with growing redshift due to its integral nature , while the other derivatives decrease .      in order to quantify the impact of the sound speed on the matter power spectrum we proceed in two ways",
    ": we first use the camb output @xcite ( which contains the full information on dark energy perturbations ) and then we consider the analytic expression from eisenstein & hu @xcite ( which does not include dark energy perturbations , i.e. does not include @xmath5 ) .    as anticipated , we find here that the impact of the derivative of the matter power spectrum with respect the sound speed on the final errors is only relevant if high values of @xmath9 are considered ; for instance if @xmath120 then the errors on the sound speed increase by about @xmath121 times when the analytic formula in ref .",
    "@xcite is considered instead of the camb output . by decreasing the sound speed ,",
    "the results are less and less affected , and are completely unchanged when @xmath122 .",
    "the reason is that for low values of the sound speed other parameters , like the growth factor , start to be the dominant source of information on @xmath123 , see fig .",

    "more recently constraints on the velocity perturbations from redshift space distortions became an important probe for dark energy phenomenology , since their combination with weak lensing allows to disentangle the two potentials , which in turn allows to put limits on the anisotropic stress of the dark sector @xcite .",
