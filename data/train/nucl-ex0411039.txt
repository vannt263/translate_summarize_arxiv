    "in the recent years the na49 experiment has collected data on pb+pb collisions at beam energies between 20 to 158with the objective to cover the critical region of energy densities where the expected phase transition to a deconfined phase might occur in the early stage of the reactions . in this contribution the energy dependence of @xmath0- and rapidity - distributions , as well as the production rates of strange particles are reviewed .",
    "na49 is a fixed target experiment at the cern sps and consists of a large acceptance magnetic spectrometer equipped with four tpcs as tracking devices and a forward calorimeter for centrality selection .",

    "[ rapall ] shows a compilation of the rapidity distributions of @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the shapes of these distributions are generally well described by a gaussian . only the @xmath5-distributions exhibit a strong variation of the shape .",
    "while at 30  they are still gaussian - shaped , a clear plateau develops with increasing beam energy .    , @xmath7 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4  in central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions as a function of @xmath8 .",

    "this is also true for the other particle types having a gaussian - like distribution , with a clear hierarchy in the widths : @xmath9 .",
    "however , this seems to break down at lower energies , where the widths of the kaons apparently approach the ones of the pions .        the dependence of the rms - widths on the particle mass at sps energies is shown in fig .  [ rmsmass ] .",
    "an approximately linear mass dependence is observed , which appears to have the same slope for all sps - energies .",
    "this mass dependence can be interpreted as a result of the thermal spectrum of hadrons superimposed on the longitudinal collective expansion .",

    "since the kaon @xmath0-spectra  in contrast to the ones of the lighter pions or the heavier protons  have to a good approximation an exponential shape , the inverse slope parameter provides in this case a good characterization of the spectra . for other particle species , however , the local slope of the spectra depends on @xmath0 .",

    "however , the introduction of an energy dependent strangeness under - saturation factor @xmath15  is needed @xcite , in order to capture the structures in the energy dependence of most particle species ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 ) .    .",

    "a smooth cross over is expected .",

    "the open symbols schematically indicate possible initial parameters of the reaction systems , which then might evolve along paths as depicted by the vertical lines.,height=283 ]    the results of the na49 energy scan program have revealed a variety of interesting features . among these",
    "are a clear change in the energy dependence of the @xmath0-spectra and a maximum in the strangeness to pion ratio around 30 .",
    "both are difficult to explain in a hadronic scenario , but can be understood as a reflection of a phase transition @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of the phase diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , is the fact that the line of the first order phase transition ends in a second order critical point @xmath32 ( for a review of the current theoretical situation see @xcite ) .",
    "its position is subject to large theoretical uncertainties , but recent lattice calculations @xcite with physical quark masses indicate that it might be around @xmath33  mev .",
    "if this estimate holds , it might be possible to access the critical endpoint with heavy ion reactions at sps energies .",
    "since the above described results on the energy dependence of hadronic observables might indicate that the phase transition is already reached at beam energies of 30 , where the chemical freeze - out happens at @xmath34  mev .",
    "this would imply that at this energy the first order transition line is crossed ( see vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] ) , while at the top sps energy the evolution passes through the rapid crossover region .",
    "therefore , a careful scan of this region of beam energy , accompanied by an additional variation of the system size , might allow to experimentally identify the position of the endpoint .",
    "an indication for the endpoint would possibly be a strong increase of fluctuations in e.g. transverse momentum , particle ratios or multiplicities .",
    "so far , only limited attempts of systematically studying these effects in the interesting energy range have been made .",
    "significant non - statistical fluctuations of the kaon to pion ratio at low sps energies are reported in @xcite . also , large multiplicity and @xmath35fluctutions in collisions of small systems at 158have been observed @xcite",
    ". however , these effects are still far from having a clear connection to the critical point .",
    "future measurements that would scan the interesting energy range and the system size more closely , might have a chance of seeing stronger evidence for its existence .",
