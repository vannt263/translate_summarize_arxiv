    "the detection of a broad component of h@xmath4 with no h@xmath8 counterpart ( ward et al .",
    "1980 ; shuder 1980 ) implied an intermediate seyfert type classification , suggesting the existence of an obscured broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "this was confirmed later by the infrared detection of a broad pa@xmath4 line ( rix et al .",
    "1990 ; goodrich , veilleux & hill 1994 ) . the optical image of ngc  2992 ( ward et al . 1980 ) shows a prominent dust lane extending along the major axis of the galaxy and crossing the nucleus .",
    "the optical extinction , measured from the balmer decrement of the narrow h@xmath4 and h@xmath8 components , is @xmath9 ( ward et al .",
    "finally , evidence for coronal lines of [ fevii ] and [ fex ] have been found in the optical spectrum by shuder ( 1980 ) and winkler ( 1992 ) .    the x  ray flux and spectrum were observed to vary during 16 years of observations performed with different satellites . as noted by weaver et al .",
    "( 1996 ; hereafter we96 ) , since the time of heao1 observations in 1978 ( mushotzky 1982 ) , the 210 kev flux of ngc  2992 decreased by a factor of @xmath10 until the asca observations in 1994 , when it reached the lowest value . a similar decrease was also observed in the soft x ",
    "rays ( we96 ) . before asca , the spectral shape exhibited some variations but on average it could be described as an absorbed ( @xmath11 @xmath3 ) power law with photon index @xmath12 and an iron k@xmath4 line .",
    "the asca spectrum was however much different , with a very flat slope ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these spectral variations have been interpreted by we96 as the evidence for radiation reprocessed by an optically and geometrically thick gaseous medium , e.g. the molecular torus invoked by unified models ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "we96 measured a time lag between the fe line and the continuum of 10@xmath144 years , from which they estimate a distance of the torus from the central engine ( @xmath15 pc , that however is still model - dependent ) .",
    "flux variability in the infrared was found by glass ( 1997 ) , who in particular remarked a fading of the source from 1978 to 1996 apart from a strong outburst in 1988 .",
    "all of this evidence suggests that before bepposax observed ngc  2992 in 1997 and 1998 , the agn in the center was turning off .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of new bepposax observations of ngc  2992 which show that the agn is back to its previous high level of activity observed in 1978 .",
    "the x  ray data are also complemented with optical and near  ir spectra obtained in a followup observation .",
    "the results of our analysis are compared with previous data in the literature .",
    "we assume @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 yielding a distance of 46 mpc for ngc  2992 .",
    "the four co  aligned narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on board the italian  dutch satellite bepposax ( boella et al . 1997a ) span the broad x  ray energy range from 0.1 to 200 kev .",
    "the nfi include the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ; parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) and the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ; boella et al .",
    "1997b ) , which both consist of a mirror unit plus a gas scintillation proportional counter and have imaging capabilities .",
    "the lecs instrument covers the energy range 0.110 kev with a spatial resolution of about @xmath18 arcmin and a spectral resolution of 8% at 6 kev .",
    "the mecs instrument operates in the 1.810 kev band with the same spatial and spectral resolution of the lecs , but is two times more sensitive in the overlapping spectral range .",
    "the other nfi are a high pressure gas proportional counter ( hpgspc ; manzo et al .",
    "1997 ) and a phoswich detector system ( pds ; frontera et al . 1997 ) , which are direct  view detectors with rocking collimators .",
    "the hpgspc ( 4120 kev ) has better energy resolution but is less sensitive than the pds ( 13200 kev ) . in this paper",
    "we will only take advantage of the lecs , mecs and pds data . errors , unless otherwise stated , will be given at the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "ngc  2992 was observed by bepposax in 1997 ( from december 1 to december 3 ) and in 1998 ( from november 25 to november 27 ) .",
    "the 1997 data and the 1998 data will be referred to as sax1 and sax2 , respectively . for the sax1 observation",
    "we will not take into account the lecs data due to poor statistics .",
    "table  [ obs_log ] shows exposure times and net count rates ( i.e. background subtracted ) for both bepposax observations .",
    "the mecs spectra for sax1 and sax2 , and the lecs spectrum for sax2 have been extracted with an aperture radius of 4 arcmin .",
    "the background subtraction files have been extracted with the same apertures from blank sky fields .",
    "the spectral data have been binned in order to have at least 20 counts per channel to validate the use of the @xmath20 statistics .",
    "a possible source of contamination in the x  ray spectrum detected by bepposax could be ngc  2993 , which lies at about 2.9 arcmin from its companion ngc  2992 .",
    "ngc  2993 has an optical magnitude comparable to that of ngc  2992 ( @xmath21 ) and also shows optical narrow emission lines and radio emission ( ward et al .",
    "1980 ) . on the basis of the optical lines , ngc  2993",
    "has been classified as a liner ( durret 1990 ) . due to the uncertain nature of liners , which could host both thermal and non - thermal activity ,",
    "ngc  2993 could contribute to the flux measured by bepposax .",
    "however , since at 1415 mhz ngc  2993 is four times less luminous than ngc  2992 ( ward et al .",
    "1980 ) , and radio emission should not suffer from absorption , ngc  2993 should be intrinsically less luminous than ngc  2992 and its contribution to the observed x  ray spectrum should be small in every x  ray energy band from lecs to pds .",
    "also , the rosat pspc data show that in the soft x  rays the flux of ngc  2993 is less than 5% of the ngc  2992 flux ( we96 ) , and an analysis of the asca sis image of the ngc  2992 field has revealed that the emission of ngc  2993 is negligible also in the 210 kev band . therefore , we consider the x ",
