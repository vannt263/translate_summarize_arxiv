    "t tauri stars are low - mass stars with an age of a few million years at most , still contracting down their hayashi tracks towards the main sequence . many of them , the so - called classical t tauri stars , show signs of accretion from a circumstellar disk ( see , e.g. , mnard & bertout 1999 for a review ) . understanding the accretion process in young solar type stars is one of the major challenges in the study of t tauri stars .",
    "indeed , accretion has a significant and long lasting impact on the evolution of low mass stars by providing both mass and angular momentum while the evolution and ultimate fate of circumstellar accretion disks have become an increasingly important issue since the discovery of extrasolar planets and planetary systems with unexpected properties . deriving the properties of young stellar systems , of their associated disks and outflows",
    "is therefore an important step towards the establishment of plausible scenarios for star and planet formation .",
    "strong surface magnetic fields have long been suspected to exist in tts based on their powerful x - ray and centrimetric radio emissions ( montmerle et al .",
    "1983 , andr 1987 ) .",
    "surface fields of order of 1 - 3 kg have recently been derived from zeeman broadening measurements of ctts photospheric lines ( johns krull et al . 1999 , 2001 ; guenther et al . 1999 ) and from the detection of electron cyclotron maser emission ( smith et al .",
    "these strong stellar magnetic fields are believed to significantly alter the accretion flow in the circumstellar disk close to the central star . based on models originally developped for magnetized compact objects in cataclysmic binaries ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) and _ assuming _ that t tauri magnetospheres are predominantly dipolar on the large scale , camenzind ( 1990 ) and knigl ( 1991 ) showed that the inner accretion disk is expected to be truncated by the magnetosphere at a distance of a few stellar radii above the stellar surface for typical mass accretion rates of 10@xmath0 to 10@xmath1m@xmath2yr@xmath3  in the disk ( basri & bertout 1989 ; hartigan et al .",
    "1995 ; gullbring et al .",
    "disk material is then channeled from the disk inner edge onto the star along the magnetic field lines , thus giving rise to magnetospheric accretion columns .",
    "as the free falling material in the funnel flow eventually hits the stellar surface , accretion shocks develop near the magnetic poles . the basic concept of magnetospheric accretion in t tauri star is illustrated in figure  [ cam ] .",
    "the successes and limits of current magnetospheric accretion models ( mams ) in accounting for the observed properties of classical t tauri systems ( ctts ) are reviewed in section 2 , while in section 3 we discuss recent results which suggest that the interaction between the star s magnetosphere and the inner disk is a highly dynamical and time dependent process .",
    "the magnetospheric accretion scenario makes clear predictions regarding the existence of an inner ( magnetospheric ) cavity with a radial extent of a few stellar radii , magnetic accretion columns filled with free falling plasma , and localized accretion shocks at the surface of ctts .",
    "observational support for these various predictions is reviewed in this section .",
    "disk truncation radii of typically 3 - 8r@xmath4 , as predicted by mams , are required to reproduce the near - ir spectral energy distribution of some ctts ( bertout et al .",
    "1988 ) and to account for the properties of ctts infrared excess on a statistical basis ( meyer et al .",
    "however , recent near - infrared monitoring studies of accreting t tauri stars have revealed large variability of some systems occurring on short timescales at these wavelengths ( eiroa et al . 2002 ) which are not easily accounted for by static mams and probably points to time variable accretion in the inner disk .",
    "moreover , the near - ir veiling measured in classical t tauri systems is often larger than predicted by standard disk models ( folha & emerson 1999 , johns - krull & valenti 2001 ) which suggests that the inner disk structure is significantly affected by its interaction with the stellar magnetosphere and departs from flat disk models .",
    "observational evidence for an inflated inner disk edge has been reported by bouvier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and is thought to result from the interaction between the disk and an _ inclined _ stellar magnetosphere ( lai 1999 , terquem & papaloizou 2000 ) .",
    "the common occurrence of inverse p cygni profiles in the higher balmer lines of ctts spectra , with redshifted absorption components reaching velocities of several hundred km s@xmath3  , points to gas being accreted onto the star at free fall velocity from a distance of several stellar radii ( edwards et al .",
    "the relative success of mams in reproducing the shape and strength of optical and near ir emission line profiles of some ctts provides additional support to the formation of at least part of the line emission in accretion columns ( hartmann et al .",
    "1994 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "2001 ; for a more critical view see ardila et al . 2002b , alencar & basri 2000 , folha & emerson 2001 ) .",
    "statistical correlations between line fluxes and mass accretion rates predicted by these models have been reported in samples of tts for a variety of emission lines in the uv , optical , and near ir range ( e.g. beristain et al .",
    "2001 , johns - krull et al .",
    "2000 , alencar & basri 2000 , folha & emerson 2001 , muzerolle et al .",
    "correlations have also been reported between mass loss rate and mass accretion rate ( e.g. , ardila et al .",
    "2002 ) as expected from mams which predict that part of the accretion flow is diverted into the wind by the magnetic field ( e.g. shu et al .",
    "1994 , ferreira 1997 ) .    in a few ctts ,",
    "synoptic studies have revealed periodic variations of the line profiles intensity and shape over a rotation timescale .",
    "the rotational modulation of line flux and radial velocity has been interpreted as resulting from the changing visibility and projected geometry of an _ inclined _ magnetosphere interacting with the disk ( johns & basri 1995 , petrov et al . 1996 , 2001 , oliveira et al .",
    "2000 , batalha et al .",
    "finally , two doppler imaging studies of ctts ( unruh et al . 1998 , johns - krull & hatzes 1997 ) have reported the existence of localized spots at the surface of ctts whose maximum visibility was found to coincide with the developement of high velocity redshifted absorptions in emission line profiles , as expected from mams when the line of sight to the accretion shock intersects the accretion column .",
    "all these observational results thus tend to support the existence of ( _ tilted _ ) magnetospheric accretion columns in ctts . to be fair , however",
    ", one must stress that the modulation of inflow and outflow signatures in line profiles has been reported so far for only a few ( well studied ) systems .",
    "moreover , even in these cases , multiple periods are sometimes observed and their relationship to the stellar rotation period is not always clear ( e.g. alencar & batalha 2002 , oliveira et al .",
    "in addition , some of the basic predictions of mams , e.g. correlated time variations of line flux ( from the accretion columns ) and continuum excess flux ( from the accretion shocks ) are not always observed ( ardila & basri 2000 , batalha et al .",
    "2002 ) . and",
    "some of the statistical correlations expected from mams for ctts samples are not always fulfilled ( johns - krull & gafford 2002 ) .",
    "hence , while several key properties of ctts emission line profiles are consistent with mams predictions and a few systems indeed appear to behave as qualitatively expected from these models , additional processes are likely present which blur the clear spectral signatures of steady state magnetospheric accretion and associated mass loss .",
    "the occasional failure to observe some of the basic predictions of static mams may result at least in part from the intrinsically unstable nature of the magnetospheric accretion process as we discuss in the section 3 .",
    "further observational support for mams comes from the detection of the rotational modulation of ctts luminosity by bright surface spots .",
    "modelling the periodic light variations observed on a timescale of the stellar rotation period suggests hot spots covering of order of one percent of the stellar surface .",
    "the localized hot spots are thus identified with the accretion shocks expected to develop near the magnetic poles at the base of magnetic accretion columns ( bouvier & bertout 1989 ; vrba et al . 1993 ) .",
    "continuum flux excesses from the uv to the optical range are expected to be associated with the accretion shock and , at least in some cases , correlated variations between the system s brightness and veiling or excess flux supports this expectation ( e.g. chelli et al . 1999 ) .",
    "accretion shock models predict the formation of high excitation lines in the shock region ( calvet & gullbring 1998 , lamzin 1995 ) and empirical evidence is consistent with the formation of narrow line profiles in the postshock gas ( e.g. hei , beristain et al .",
    "2001 ) while broader profiles would arise from the preshock region ( e.g. gomez de castro & lamzin 1999 ) .",
    "however , the width , strength and kinematics of high excitation uv lines have so far eluded model predictions being broader ( @xmath5200 km / s , ardila et al",
    ". 2002a ) , stronger ( lamzin & kravtsova , this volume ) and exhibiting lower centroid velocities ( ardila & johns - krull , this volume ) than expected from models .",
    "solving the discrepancies between mams predictions and observed line profiles may require the inclusion of a turbulent component in the accretion flow ( ardila et al .",
    "2002b , alencar & basri 2000 ) .",
    "turbulence may additionally provide a heating source for the plasma in the funnel flow , up to values deduced from the observations ( @xmath610@xmath7k ) which non turbulent models hardly reach ( e.g. martin 1996 ) .",
    "thus , turbulence could conceivably generate magnetic waves whose damping in the accretion column would contribute to the heating of the plasma ( see vasconcelos et al .",
    ", this volume ) . clearly , improved shock models are required to yield a self - consistent description of the physical conditions in the magnetic accretion region of ctts .",
    "t tauri stars have surprisingly low rotation rates considering that they accrete high angular momentum material from their disk . in the magnetospheric accretion framework ,",
    "the lever arm provided by extended magnetic field lines threading the disk outside the corotation radius allows the star to tranfer angular momentum outwards with a net braking effect ( collier cameron & campbell 1993 ; armitage & clarke 1996 ; shu et al .",
    "this possibly accounts for the slower rotation rates of accreting t tauri stars compared to non accreting ones , as originally reported by bouvier et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and edwards et al .",
    "recent and more complete studies of tts rotation rates have however failed to reveal the expected correlation between low rotation and disk accretion , at least for very low mass t tauri stars ( see stassun et al .",
    "1999 ; herbst et al .",
    "nevertheless , evidence has been accumulating that low mass pre - main sequence stars evolve down their hayashi tracks without accelerating ( rebull et al .",
    "2002 ) , thus confirming the apparent paradox that the central star loses large amounts of angular momentum during the accretion phase .",
    "many of the expected signatures of magnetically mediated accretion have thus been observed in ctts .",
    "evidence , however , comes mostly from snapshot studies and it is only recently that the stability of the phenomenon has started to be addressed .",
    "time dependent modelling of the interaction between the inner disk and the stellar magnetosphere requires heavy numerical simulations and observational clues can only be obtained through long term monitoring studies combining high resolution spectroscopy and multi band photometry . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review model predictions regarding the temporal evolution of the process and recent observational results which seem to indicate that it is highly time dependent indeed .",
    "most mams assume that the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk close to the corotation radius , i.e. , the radius in the disk where the keplerian angular velocity of the disk material equals that of the star .",
    "field lines threading the disk at this radius thus corotate with the central object .",
    "however , due to the finite radial distance over which the stellar magnetosphere interacts with the inner disk , the footpoints of most field lines rotate differentially , one being anchored into the star , the other into the keplerian disk .",
    "recent numerical simulations indicate that magnetic field lines are thus substantially distorted by differential rotation on a timescale of only a few keplerian periods at the inner disk .",
    "one class of models predict that differential rotation leads to the expansion of the field lines , their opening and eventually their reconnection which restores the initial ( assumed dipolar ) magnetospheric configuration ( e.g. aly & kuijpers 1990 ; goodson et al .",
    "1997 ; goodson & winglee 1999 ) .",
    "inflation cycles _ are thus expected to develop and to be accompanied by violent episodic outflows as field lines open and reconnect as well as time dependent accretion rate onto the star ( hayashi et al .",
    "1996 ; romanova et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the most recent 3d mhd simulations of disk accretion onto an inclined stellar magnetosphere are presented in romanova et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and illustrate well the extreme complexity of the process .",
    "other models , however , suggest that the field lines respond to differential rotation by drifting radially outwards in the disk , leading to magnetic flux expulsion ( bardou & heyvaerts 1996 ) .",
    "the response of the magnetic configuration to differential rotation mainly depends upon the magnitude of magnetic diffusivity in the disk , a parameter of the models which is poorly constrained from basic principles .      due mostly to the lack of intense monitoring of ctts on proper timescales ,",
    "the observational evidence for a time dependent interaction between the inner disk and the stellar magnetosphere is at present limited .",
    "episodic high velocity outbursts , possibly connected with magnetospheric reconnection events , have been reported for a few systems based on the slowly varying velocity of blueshifted absorption components in emission line profiles on a timescale of hours to days ( alencar et al .",
    "2001 ; ardila et al .",
    "possible evidence for magnetic field lines being twisted by differential rotation has been reported for su aur by oliveira et al .",
    "these authors measured a time delay of a few hours between the appearance of high velocity redshifted absorption components in line profiles formed at different altitudes in the accretion column .",
    "they interpreted this result as the crossing of an azimuthally twisted accretion column on the line of sight .",
    "another possible evidence for magnetic field lines being twisted by differential rotation and leading to quasi - periodic reconnection processes has been reported for the embedded protostellar source ylw 15 based on the observations of quasi - periodic x - ray flaring ( montmerle et al . 2000 ) .",
    "large scale synoptic studies of a handful of ctts have been performed in the last years and provided new insight into the magnetospheric accretion process and its temporal evolution .",
    "two of these have targetted the ctts aa tau which proved to be ideally suited to probe the inner few 0.01 au of the disk - magnetosphere interaction region . due to its high inclination ( @xmath875@xmath9 ,",
    "see bouvier et al .",
    "1999 ) , the line of sight to the star intersects the region where the stellar magnetosphere threads the disk . the peculiar orientation of this otherwise typical ctts maximizes the variability induced by the modulation of the magnetospheric structure and thus provides the strongest constraints on the inner disk and the magnetospheric cavity .    a first monitoring campaign , whose results are reported in bouvier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , led to the discovery of recurrent eclipses of the central object with a period of 8.2 days .",
    "the eclipses were attributed to a non axisymmetric warp of the inner disk edge which periodically obscures the the central star as it orbits it at keplerian speed .",
    "such an inner disk warp is expected to develop as the disk encounters an _",
    "inclined _ magnetosphere ( terquem & papaloizou 2000 ; lai 1999 ; romanova et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a second campaign which combined photometry and high resolution spectroscopy and whose results are reported in bouvier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) was performed in 1999 .",
    "the spectroscopic variability provided evidence for accretion columns and associated hot spots with signatures ( redshifted absorptions , continuum excesses ) modulated on the rotation timescale of the system .",
    "in addition , a time delay of about 1 day was reported between the flux variations of lines forming at a different altitude in the accretion column , from h@xmath10 near the disk inner edge to hei close to the stellar surface .",
    "the measured time delay is consistent with accreted gas blobs propagating downwards along the accretion column at free fall velocity from a distance of about 8 r@xmath4 , the radius at which the stellar magnetosphere disrupts the inner disk .",
    "these line flux variations indicate non steady accretion along the magnetic funnel flows onto the star on short timescales .    on longer timescales , of order of one month",
    ", line and continuum excess flux variations were also observed , indicative of a smoothly varying mass accretion rate onto the star .",
    "simultaneously , a tight correlation was observed between the radial velocity of the blueshifted and redshifted absorption components in the h@xmath10 emission line profile ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "since the former is a wind diagnostics while the latter forms in the accretion flow , this correlation provides additional evidence for a physical connection between ( time dependent ) inflow and outflow in ctts .",
    "bouvier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argued that the associated flux and radial velocity variations can be consistently interpreted in the framework of _ magnetospheric inflation cycles _ , as predicted by recent numerical simulations of the star - disk interaction .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "as magnetic field lines expand due to differential rotation between the star and the inner disk , the radial velocity of the accretion ( resp .",
    "wind ) flow decreases ( resp .",
    "increases ) due to projection effects on the line of sight . at the same time",
    ", the loading of disk material onto inflated field lines becomes increasingly difficult owing to the large angle field lines make relative to the disk plane .",
    "this results in a reduced accretion rate onto the star , as deduced from the depressed line and continuum fluxes observed at this phase .",
    "the last synoptic campaign on aa tau thus yields the first evidence for global instabilities developping on a timescale of a month in the large scale structure of the magnetosphere , a result which provides support to the predictions of time dependent models of magnetospheric accretion .",
    "whether these magnetospheric instabilities are cyclic , being driven by differential rotation as predicted by numerical models , will require additional monitoring lasting for several months .",
    "observational evidence for magnetospheric accretion being instrumental in classical t tauri stars has accumulated in recent years .",
    "several key properties of these young stars are naturally accounted for by assuming that the stellar magnetic field governs the accretion flow close to the star .",
    "the strong variability of ctts on all timescales , from hours to months ( and possibly years , bertout 2000 ) , further suggests that the magnetically mediated interaction between the accretion disk and the central object is a highly dynamical and time dependent process .",
    "the implications of the non steadiness of magnetospheric accretion in ctts are plentiful and remain to be fully explored .",
    "they range from the evolution of their angular momentum ( agapitou & papaloizou 2000 ) , the origin of inflow / ouflow short term variability ( woitas et al . 2002 , lopez - martin et al . 2003 ) , the modelling of the near infrared excess of ctts and of its variations both of which will be affected by a non standard and time dependent inner disk structure ( carpenter et al .",
    "2001 , eiroa et al .",
    "2002 , johns - krull & valenti 2003 ) , the origin of ctts variability which is expected to be a complex combination of modulation by hot and cold spots and variable circumstellar extinction ( e.g. dewarf et al .",
    "2003 ) , and possibly the halting of planet migration close to the star ( lin et al ."
