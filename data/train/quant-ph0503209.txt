    "recent advances in quantum information science have shown that , on one hand , photons are ideal carriers of quantum information , and on the other hand , atoms represent reliable and long - lived storage and processing units . in recent years",
    "quantum light storage is one of the extensively studied tasks of quantum optics .",
    "basic idea of light storage is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency is a coherent interaction process in which a coupling laser field is used to made the optical dense media transparent for the probe field . since its discovery , a number of new effects and techniques for light - matter interaction have appeared [ 2 - 6 ] .",
    "most notably , from the point of view of the work presented here , particular attention has been devoted to ultraslow light propagation and light storage techniques [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "the key concept of eit is the dark state and population trapping arrimon .",
    "the dark state is a specific coherent superposition state which does not contain excited short - living atomic level due to  destructive interference between two interaction paths .",
    "the dark - state is eigenstate of the light ",
    "atom interaction hamiltonian , so the atom prepared in a dark - state can not be excited and can not leave the dark - state if the interaction is adiabatic ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the population trapping via applying strong coupling leads to the adiabatic formation of the dark - state . since the interaction is realized by the light pulses the infuence of nonadiabatic corrections may become important @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this infuence has been studied e.g. in @xcite . in particular",
    ", the first nonadiabatic correction connects the dark state and the bright state , so the depletion of the bright state , because of optical pumping , can affect the dark state .",
    "despite of large amount of experimental and theoretical papers concerning light storage ( see @xcite  and citations there ) , and applications in quantum information science , the influence of decoherence level width on information carried by stored light is studied insufficiently .    in this work we present theoretical study which discusses and explains influence of all relaxations on probe propagation both analytically and numerically ( it is essential in especially , solid state systems @xcite ) .",
    "the goal is to study comprehensively how the depletion of bright state will affect the pulse propagation in an eit  media and light storage in particular .  by solving the coupled system of maxwell and density matrix equations to the first order of the nonstationary pertrubation theory with respect to nonadiabaticity and decoherence we obtain analytical solution which completely describes the probe pulse propagation and",
    "is consistent with the recent light storage experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the basic equations are written down and the probe pulse propagation equation is derived and analyzed . in section iii and appendixes the analytical solution for counterintuitive pulse switching order and for matched pulses are obtained and the asymptotic solutions discussed .",
    "section iv deals with the physical consequences of the obtained solution , namely the necessary conditions of the pulse storage and retrieving , also the numerical results are demonstrated . in section",
    "v we consider the transverse relaxation of the coherence induced in the medium .",
    "section vi concludes the paper .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the atomic system in the eit basis : media of three level atoms interacting with two laser pulses @xmath0 ( probe)and @xmath1 _ _  _ _ ( coupling ) .",
    "the probe field resonantly connects the state @xmath2 to the state @xmath3 and the coupling field connects @xmath4 to @xmath5where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the respective rabi frequencies , @xmath8 are the atomic transition operators , @xmath9 @xmath10 is the detuning of the pulse frequencies from the upper level and @xmath11 ( @xmath7 ) are the dipole moments of corresponding transitions .",
    "we assume  that : ( i ) the probe field is weak as compared to the coupling pulse field @xmath12 ; ( ii ) the interaction is adiabatic ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the interaction duration ) .",
    "then , the atomic density matrix equation may be written as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the width of the upper level which is the sum of the spontaneous decay and transverse relaxations rates .",
    "it is supposed that interaction is fast enough to neglect the decoherence between metastable levels ( sec .",
    "iii , iv ) , or to take it into account to the first order ( sec .",
    "the propagation of the pulses is governed by the maxwell equation for slowly varying amplitudes,@xmath17where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the atomic number density .",
    "system of equations ( [ bloch ] ) can be reduced to one equation for @xmath20@xmath21where @xmath22 is the common used notation for the so called mixing angle .",
    "influence of the first two terms in ( dens ) can be neglected if we confine to  only first terms with respect to the nonadiabaticity ( i.e. @xmath23 is neglected ) .",
    "influence of the fourth term in ( [ dens ] ) is essential parameter only under the assumption@xmath24the meaning of the condition ( [ largeg ] )  is obvious : under the condition of complete adiabaticity relaxation does not affect the pulse propagation ( dark - state ) , but taking into account first nonadiabatic correction , has essential influence .",
    "the relaxation can be neglected when @xmath25 .",
    "finally , by substituting the maxwell equation ( [ prop ] ) into ( [ dens ] ) one gets pulse propagation equation in wave variables @xmath26 , @xmath27,@xmath28    where notation @xmath29 is used . in this connection",
    "the coherence dynamics is governed by the following equation:@xmath30    thus @xmath31 is the coherence decay rate , or width of eit  resonance , due to applied coupling . under the condition@xmath32equation ( [ coh_dyn ] ) has the well known quasi - stationary solution @xmath33 @xcite , and the equation ( [ probe_prop ] ) passes to the dark state polariton propagation equation . the condition ( [ bright ] )",
    "means , that width of eit  resonance exceeds the spectral width of the probe .",
    "the obtained probe pulse propagation equation ( [ probe_prop ] ) is solved by the method presented in @xcite .",
    "since ( [ probe_prop ] ) is linear in @xmath34 and @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 , it can be solved by using the laplace transform with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "the solution of ( [ probe_prop ] ) for @xmath34 s laplace image can be found easily:@xmath37where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is an integration constant that is determined by the initial condition , @xmath40 . if pulses are switched in counterintuitive sequence ( coupling turns on earlier than the probe does ) then @xmath41 , since @xmath42 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "space time evolution of the probe pulse is obtained by implementing the reverse laplace transform in ( [ image_sol]).@xmath43    where @xmath44 is propagation distance normalized to linear absorption factor and , for convenience , the notation @xmath45 is used .  by using the condition @xmath46 one can substitute the modified bessel function by its asymptote , so the solution ( [ solution ] )  reduces to the following :    @xmath47    depending on optical propagation distance @xmath48 two simple asymptotes for ( gauss )",
    "can be obtained ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the first is the case where@xmath49@xmath50 is the maximal value of @xmath51 ( see also @xcite ) . under condition ( [ polariton_cond ] ) , solution ( [ solution ] )",
    "reduces to the dark - state polariton propagation solution with correction in ( [ bright]):@xmath52where @xmath53 is the non - linear time determined by @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "note , that turning off the coupling @xmath35 does not reduce @xmath55  to zero , since @xmath53 retards from @xmath56 . in this case , as it will be shown below , the information stored in the medium can be well retrieved ( see sec .",
    "iv ) .    in the case of condition reversed to ( [ polariton_cond]),@xmath57the _ _  _ _ solution ( [ solution ] ) reduces to @xmath58where @xmath59 is the maximal value of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and does not depend on time .",
    "we emphasize that for propagation distances meeting the condition ( bluring_cond ) , the obtained pulse loses all the information about its initial temporal shape , since the right hand side in ( [ bluring ] ) does not contain time dependent @xmath62 .",
    "in this section the probe pulse propagation dynamics obtained from the analytical solution ( [ solution ] ) is presented .",
    "first of all we consider the case of constant coupling field . shape of the initial pulse is chosen to be double - humped in order to visualize the propagation dynamics .",
    "for the small propagation distances when the condition ( [ polariton_cond ] )  is met influence of @xmath16 is negligible ( fig.2a ) .",
    "when the condition ( polariton_cond ) is violated , the influence of upper level width becomes essential as one can see from figs . 2b , c .",
    "thus influence of @xmath16 breaks the adiabaton propagation regime .",
    "as it was mentioned above , propagation over very long distances ( bluring_cond ) leads to the lost of the information on the initial pulse temporal shape .",
    "this can be seen in fig 3 , where propagation over the same distance of two pulses with different temporal shapes but with the same initial area is depicted . by propagating over very long distance ( bluring_cond )",
    "they lose any information about their initial temporal shapes .    in fig .",
    "4 we show that the increase of @xmath31 suppresses the smearing of the probe .",
    "this is caused by the decrease of the bright state population and hence leads to the decrease the influence of @xmath16 on pulse propagation .",
    "note , that in the dark - state propagation regime the pulse temporal shape does not depend on coupling field amplitude or on unstable level width .    summarizing presented results",
    "one can see that to minimize the pulse smearing during its propagation one has to either increase @xmath31 or decrease the propagation distance @xmath48 .",
    "the situation changes dramatically for the light storage and retrieving process ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is known , that pulse can be completely stored and retrieved from the medium if the medium length and @xmath31 meet the condition ( see for example @xcite):@xmath64    for efficient storage and retrieving the condition ( [ polariton_cond ] ) also has to be met . combining this two nonequalities",
    "one gets that to completely store and well retrieve the light pulse , @xmath31 has to meet the following condition:@xmath65@xmath66    therefore , influence of the second term in ( [ polariton ] ) is insufficient when the condition ( [ good_storage ] ) is met .",
    "storage and retrieving of the light pulse for different propagation distances under the condition ( [ good_storage ] ) is depicted in fig 5 . for small propagation distances when the condition ( [ fitting ] ) is violated only the falling edge of the pulse is stored and can be retrieved ( fig .",
    "5a ) , because when this edge enters the medium , the leading edge emerges already . for larger propagation distances when the condition ( [ fitting ] ) is satisfied",
    "the whole pulse can be stored and then well retrieved by turning on the coupling field .",
    "let us now consider the case when the condition ( [ good_storage ] ) is not met ( fig .",
    "6 ) . for small propagation distances",
    "when the condition ( polariton_cond ) is satisfied but ( [ fitting ] )  is not , only the falling edge of the pulse can be stored and retrieved .",
    "propagation over longer distances brings to satisfying of ( [ fitting ] )  and violation of ( polariton_cond ) .",
    "thus the whole pulse can be stored but the retrieved pulse temporal shape is smeared .",
    "we present finally comparison of the experimental results with our analytical solution . in fig 7a",
    "the experimental data of storage and retrieving of light pulse from @xcite are presented .",
    "curve in fig 7b is plotted from our analytical solution ( [ solution ] ) : all parameters correspond to the conditions of the experiment .",
    "one can see good consistency between experimental data and our analytical solution ( note that the storage in case of experiment ( ) is incomplete as was discussed above ) .",
    "in this sections we take into acount the quantity @xmath68 in first order .",
    "this leads , instead of ( [ bloch ] ) , to the equations .",
    "@xmath69    thus , probe pulse propagation equation is written as follows:@xmath70    where @xmath51 now is@xmath71    as results from ( [ v_3 ] ) , to completely stop the light in the medium @xmath72 one should turn off the coupling field @xmath73 at the rate @xmath16 ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) .    by performing the stated above laplace transform procedure",
    "one obtains analytical solution of the equation ( [ v_2 ] ) in the form@xmath75where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "more detailed analysis of the expression ( [ v_2 ] ) will be performed in a subsequent publication .",
    "we have considered the propagation , storage and retrieving of the light pulse in eit media by taking into account all dephasing rates . from coupled system of maxwell and density matrix equations",
    "we derive the probe pulse propagation equation , which in particular case passes into the dark - state polariton propagation equation .",
    "we find an analytical solution and analyzed its physical consequences .",
    "we derived a simple asymptotes of the solution , and showed strong dependence of light pulse temporal shape on optical propagation distance in the presence of relaxations .",
    "we demonstrated that an efficient storage of light is possible by choosing appropriate coupling intensities and optical propagation distances .",
    "finally , we compared our solution with experimental data and showed that our solution is well consistent with the recent experiments",
    ".          from this equation one obtains @xmath79 , and the solution can formally be written as @xmath80 .",
    "this can be simplified by taking into account that there is no dipole moment induced before the interaction is turned on ( @xmath81),@xmath82          the integrand function in ( [ gauss ] ) is the product of two time dependent bell - shaped functions .",
    "this kind of integral is evaluated easily when the temporal width of one function is much larger than the width of the other one .",
    "then by the first order saddle - point technique the narrow function can be approximated by delta function .",
    "on the one hand , if the condition ( [ polariton_cond ] ) is met , the integration of ( [ gauss ] )  gives the well known dark - state polariton solution ( [ polariton ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the condition ( bluring_cond ) is satisfied , integration of ( [ gauss ] )  by the saddle - point technique brings to the asymptote ( [ bluring ] ) .",
