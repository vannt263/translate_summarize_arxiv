    "geometrical frustration in the charge degrees of freedom of the cuo double chains of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 has provided an interesting opportunity for studying anomalous metallic states realized in quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) electronic conductors .",
    "experimentally , it has been reported  @xcite that the system shows metallic conductivity along the chain direction down to 2k and that it shows insulating conductivity along the directions perpendicular to the chain above @xmath3140 k. the system may thus be regarded as a quasi-1d correlated conductor except at low temperatures .",
    "below @xmath3140 k , the conductivity of the system shows a 2d behavior within the crystallographic @xmath4-@xmath5 plane ,  @xcite indicating that the coupling between the chains is not negligible .",
    "anomalous behaviors in prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 have been observed in particular in its charge degrees of freedom . a nuclear - quadrupole - resonance ( nqr ) experiment  @xcite showed that the temperature dependence of the spin - lattice ( @xmath6 ) and spin - spin ( @xmath7 ) relaxations is anomalous , indicating the presence of very slow fluctuations of charge carriers . a polarized optical spectrum for @xmath8 ( electric field @xmath9 parallel to the @xmath4 axis ) demonstrated that the cuo@xmath0 planes of this material maintain the charge - transfer ( ct ) insulating state with a ct gap of 1.4 ev ,  @xcite which is typical of that of cuprates , but the spectrum for @xmath10 ( chain direction ) exhibits a broad peak structure at @xmath11 mev with a very small but nonzero drude weight ( @xmath32% of the total weight ) .",
    "@xcite tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) behavior was also suggested ; from the power - law dependence dominating in the higher - energy part of the optical conductivity , the exponent @xmath12 was estimated to be @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite moreover , an angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) study of zn - doped prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 showed a power - law behavior of the spectral function near the fermi level , which is indicative of a tll state , and a value @xmath14 was estimated .",
    "@xcite such a small value of @xmath12 suggests that the long - range coulomb interaction between charge carriers should be very strong .",
    "it was also reported that the system of the cuo double chains is near quarter filling of holes .",
    "@xcite a good opportunity has thus been provided for studying the anomalous charge dynamics of strongly correlated 1d electron systems such as charge ordering ( co ) , charge fluctuation , and charge frustration .",
    "a few theoretical studies have so far been made on the cuo double chains of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 . using lanczos exact - diagonalization technique on small clusters , seo and ogata",
    "@xcite studied similar models and proposed possibility of the appearance of a metallic phase due to geometrical frustration ; the system sizes used were however very small , so that whether the first charge excitation is gapped or gapless in the thermodynamic limit was not clear .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated a spinless fermion model at half filling , which corresponds to a quarter - filled extended hubbard model in the limit of large on - site repulsion @xmath15 , and found that a metallic state is realized due to the effect of frustration among fermions when long - range repulsive interactions among them compete .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the optical conductivity spectrum in the mean - field theory and showed that it agrees well with experiment only when the stripe - type co is present ; they thereby argued that the observed anomalous optical response may be due to the presence of the stripe - type fluctuations of charge carriers in the cuo double chains .    motivated by such development in the field",
    ", we here investigate the ground state of the extended hubbard model at quarter filling , an effective model for the cuo double chain of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "an isolated double - chain system is considered in this paper because to clarify its nature is essential before the ` dimensional crossover ' is taken into account .",
    "we use the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite for calculating the ground and low - energy excited states of the model , as well as its charge and spin correlation functions .",
    "we will show that our model in its ground state has the co phases with stripe - type and in - line  type patterns in the parameter space , and in - between , there appears a wide region of vanishing charge gap ; the latter phase is characteristic of either a tll or a metallic state with a spin gap .",
    "the spin gap remains open unless the filling deviates largely from a quarter .",
    "we will then consider possible experimental relevance of our results .",
    "we will in particular argue that the low - energy electronic state of the cuo double chains of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 should be in the metallic state with a possibly small spin gap .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a single - band hubbard model defined on a 1d lattice for the cuo double chain of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and give some numerical details of the dmrg method used . in sec .",
    "iii , we present calculated results for the charge gap , phase diagram , spin correlations , charge correlations , and luttinger parameters , and discuss anomalous properties of the liquid phase of our system . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize the results obtained and discuss their possible experimental relevance .",
    "the structural element of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 that we consider is the cuo double chain with unit cell cu@xmath0o@xmath1 ,  @xcite the geometry of which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the relevant orbitals on the cu and o sites are the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals , respectively . from the antibonding band of these two orbitals",
    ", we may extract an effective model , i.e. , a single - band extended hubbard model for low - energy electronic states of the cuo double chains ( see fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) , where the o ions are no longer explicitly present .",
    "such reduction of dimensionality allows us to carry out detailed numerical studies .",

    "we assume a value of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath15 as @xmath33 , which is somewhat larger than a typical value for cuprate materials ; by using this value , however , we can investigate interesting features of our model with a wide range of @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "we believe that this choice does not change the essential features of our results .",
    "the filling of holes in the cuo double chains is reported to be @xmath34 ,  @xcite ; we therefore restrict ourselves to the case at quarter filling unless otherwise indicated , i.e. , @xmath35 corresponding to a density of one hole per two cu sites . note that the repulsions @xmath28 and @xmath30 are frustrating interactions for the charge degrees of freedom of the system in the sense that two holes can choose to sit on two of the three sites of a triangle of the lattice in mutually competing energy scales @xmath28 and @xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "if we assume the intersite coulomb repulsions to be inversely proportional to the intersite distance , we have the relation @xmath36 , which is not far from the line @xmath37 where the two repulsions @xmath28 and @xmath30 exactly compete at @xmath38 .",
    "we use the dmrg method ,  @xcite a powerful numerical technique for a variety of 1d systems , whereby we can obtain very accurate ground - state energies and expectation values for very large finite - size systems .",
    "we study the chains with up to 128 sites .",
    "the open - end boundary conditions are used ; when we calculate local quantities , they are actually the ones averaged over the chain and when we show correlation functions , they are the ones measured from the midpoint of the chain .",
    "we use up to @xmath39 density matrix eigenstates to build the dmrg basis .",
    "one needs to keep relatively large values of @xmath40 to obtain sufficient accuracies in our system because the long - range hopping term increases the truncation error rapidly ; this is in particular the case when @xmath41 . extrapolating the dmrg ground - state energies calculated for different @xmath40 values to an energy for vanishing discarded weight ,",
    "@xcite we obtain the ground state energy and excitation gap which are accurate to parts in @xmath42 .",
    "although the largest source of errors in our calculations are finite size effects , we are able to extrapolate a number of gap values measured for different system sizes to a value for an infinite system - size chain .    in the following , we first present calculated results for the charge gap in order to show that the geometrical frustration indeed induces the metal - insulator ( mi ) phase transition ; the ground - state phase diagram is shown in the parameter space of the inter - site coulomb interactions .",

    "another is the tll phase where neither spin gap nor charge gap is present and the @xmath69-cdw fluctuation is dominant .    for a lucid discussion , let us now assume the case @xmath165 and consider some limiting cases .",
    "when @xmath166 , the @xmath68-cdw transition occurs at @xmath167 . if the system can be regarded as two separate @xmath29-chains due to very small @xmath86 , this transition would be equivalent to the @xmath69-cdw transition of the quarter - filled spinless hubbard chain with the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath29 and the next - nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath30 , where the critical value of @xmath52 is expected to be 2 , which is consistent with our results .",
    "when @xmath46 , the @xmath69-cdw transition occurs around @xmath168 .",
    "we can estimate this value from comparison between the energies of the metallic and insulating solutions .",
    "first , the metallic solution may be obtained as follows .",
    "consider the system consisting of two independent quarter - filled @xmath29-chains .",
    "then , if we assume the coulomb repulsion between the @xmath29-chains , the total ground - state energy may roughly be evaluated as @xmath169 here @xmath170 is the ground - state energy of a spinless - fermion model defined on a single chain at quarter filling with the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath29 , and @xmath171 is the average coulomb interaction .",
    "next , the insulating solution may readily be obtained because it corresponds to the @xmath69-cdw state , i.e. , one of the @xmath29-chains is at half filling and another @xmath29-chain is empty , whereby we obtain the ground - state energy to be almost zero .",
    "hence , the condition for emergence of the @xmath69-cdw state is that the value of eq .",
    "( [ metal-4kf ] ) is larger than zero .",
    "if we use an estimation @xmath172 made from the lieb - wu equations,@xcite the critical interaction strength can be obtained as @xmath173 .",
    "we should note that , because we have used a small but finite value of @xmath86 , the actual critical values of the interactions calculated are rather larger than the above estimation .",
    "next , we turn to the case where both @xmath65 and @xmath52 are nonzero . naturally , the system is metallic for small @xmath28 and @xmath30 ( @xmath174 ) , and the metallic phase becomes narrower as the long - range coulomb interactions increase along the line @xmath73 .",
    "for very large values of @xmath28 and @xmath30 , the boundary between the @xmath68-cdw ( the @xmath69-cdw ) and the sgl ( tll ) phases becomes parallel to the line @xmath73 , and the distance between the two phases remains to be of the order of @xmath29 ( @xmath27 ) even in the limit of @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "even if there is no hybridization , i.e. , @xmath38 , the charge mode is gapless on the line @xmath73 .",
    "this means that the effects of @xmath28 and @xmath30 are precisely cancelled out on that line . now ,",
    "if finite values of @xmath27 and/or @xmath29 are introduced , the energy gain due to moving holes expands the width of the line .",

    "we have shown that the model has the co phases with the stripe - type and in - line  type patterns in the parameter space and between the two co phases there appears a wide region of vanishing charge gap , which is due to geometrical frustration of the long - range coulomb interactions .",

    "finally , let us discuss consistency between our numerical results and available experimental data on prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "comparable experimental features are the appearance of the tll behaviors and estimation of the value @xmath193.@xcite we can explain such a small value of @xmath12 only by assuming that the system is in the @xmath68-cdw state or in the sgl state near the @xmath68-cdw phase boundary . in these two phases of our phase diagram , however , a small but finite spin gap clearly exists except at @xmath88 .",
    "we have also confirmed that the spin gap remains open even if the system is doped slightly away from quarter filling .",
    "thus , the phase is not tll unless @xmath88 , which is apparently not consistent with experiment .",
    "one possibility for reconciliation may be that the cuo double chain system has a very small value of @xmath27 , so that experiments performed with finite resolution can not detect the effects of the spin gap .",
    "another possibility is that the optical and arpes spectra observed in relatively high energies are insensitive to the opening of the spin gap . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have calculated the optical conductivity of our model with the dynamical dmrg method  @xcite and confirmed that the shape of the higher energy part ( @xmath194 ) of the conductivity does not depend on the existence of small values of @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we show an example of the @xmath27-dependence of the optical conductivity calculated for a possible set of parameters .",
    "we find that the spectra for @xmath195 and @xmath196 are almost the same and the power - law decay can be seen at @xmath197 . from a fit of the results to the form @xmath198 , we estimate the value @xmath199 , which corresponds to @xmath200 .",
    "this value is very close to the value obtained experimentally .",
    "here we point out that the long - range cdw ground state can not reproduce the experimental spectrum but a small hole doping of only a few % changes the shape of spectrum largely leading to the power - law decay of the spectra at high energies .",
    "we therefore suggest that the actual material is located in the sgl phase near the @xmath68-cdw phase or in the @xmath68-cdw phase with slight doping .",
