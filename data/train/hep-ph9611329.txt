    "in this note we will present a variety of important topics related to differential distributions in semihadronic @xmath9 decays .",

    "we have used @xmath18 in specific cases , there are various simplifications .",
    "if the two mesons are two pions , @xmath19 , then the vector current is conserved and the scalar form factor vanishes , @xmath20 for @xmath21 . in the three pion case , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , bose symmetry relates @xmath24 to @xmath25 , via @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 parity conservation requires @xmath28 for @xmath21 , and pcac requires @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "so we have seen the the hadronic matrix element for two ( three ) mesons in the final state is characterized by two ( four ) complex functions of one ( three ) hadronic invariants . for experimental analyses , it turns out to be very useful to trade the two ( four ) complex functions for four ( sixteen ) real valued `` structure functions '' @xmath31 , which are defined from the hadronic tensor @xmath32 in the hadronic rest frame @xcite , @xmath33 for the precise definitions , the reader is referred to @xcite , the main points are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tabsf ] .",
    "the differential decay rate is given by @xcite : @xmath34 note that @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 alone determine @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( almost ) all structure functions can be determined and disentangled from each other by studying angular correlations of the hadronic system , for details see @xcite .",
    "* tau decays into three pions involve hadronic invariant masses @xmath41 from threshold @xmath42 up to @xmath43",
    ". therefore theoretical predictions are difficult , and one has to resort to phenomenological models . however , for @xmath41 below about @xmath44 , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite allows to calculate the hadronic matrix elements in a systematic expansion in external momenta and quark masses .",
    "this is interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , this calculation allows to understand the complicated three pion dynamics systematically in a small corner of phase space , which can be used to test and improve phenomenological models .",
    "second , the small @xmath3 region could become accessible experimentally in future at @xmath45 and @xmath9-charm factories .    here",
    "we want to emphasize a few new and interesting features arising from the one loop calculation in chpt .",
    "we will explain their origin in detail , and claim that they should be seen by the new high statistics experiments .",
    "sometimes it is useful to parametrize the hadronic matrix element using conventions which differ from the notation introduced in sec .  2 .",

    "this general matrix element can be projected on a physical matrix element in a trivial manner : isospin symmetry allows to relate the matrix element of the different decay channels .",
    "we have calculated them in the framework of chpt to one loop .",
    "the complete analytic results and a very detailed analysis are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we would like to discuss some interesting features of this decay as predicted by chpt at the level of structure functions , showing how they derive from basic properties of the form factors .",
    "we will consider only four structure functions @xmath31 , the ones related only to the spin 1 part of the matrix element .",

    "the @xmath58 chiral prediction for the branching ratio for @xmath67 is of the order of @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this shows that experimental tests in the low energy region are difficult but not hopeless .",
    "moreover , some of the qualitative features of the structure functions , which the chiral expansion allows to understand in detail , will also have consequences at higher energies and so can be tested experimentally more easily .",
    "q^2[^2 ]    the first feature , which the chiral expansion predicts , is that @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the four plots can not be distinguished from each other within the resolution of fig .",
    "[ figwa ] .",
    "the equality of the structure functions for the two charge modes indicates that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are dominated by the [ 210 ] partition @xcite .",
    "we have explicitly verified that this is the case .",
    "the near equality of @xmath73 and @xmath74 at low energies can be understood algebraically . in eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) we read that @xmath75 @xmath47 vanishes at tree level according to ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "thus the difference starts as the _ square _ of a quantity of @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47 is kinematically suppressed at low energies , because it vanishes for @xmath77 .",
    "therefore @xmath78 should be valid even at energies well above those where one would trust a one loop chpt calculation .    in fig .",
    "[ figwa ] we also compare to the prediction from the vector meson dominance model ( vmd ) in @xcite .",
    "below @xmath41 of about @xmath79 , where we would trust chpt , we find very good agreement between the vmd model and the one loop chiral prediction .",

    "[ figwd ] and [ figwe ] we plot @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these are much smaller than @xmath73 , and correspondingly more difficult to be measured .",
    "a measurement of them in the low energy region can only be considered at a @xmath45 or @xmath9-charm factory .",
    "the behaviour of these structure functions is rather interesting .",
    "the one loop predictions from chpt differ strongly for the two charge modes .",
    "the origin of this sign difference can again be understood in detail : neglecting @xmath82 that as discussed above is tiny near threshold , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the real and imaginary part of the same function : @xmath85 the leading contribution to this function comes from the interference of the tree level part of @xmath59 and the one loop part of @xmath47 . at tree level",
    "@xmath59 exhibits a simple sign difference for the two charge modes : @xmath86 since @xmath47 does not change sign between the two charge modes the same sign difference as in @xmath59 at tree level is reproduced in the two structure functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in our numerical calculation",
    "the sign difference remains up to @xmath87 , where large corrections to this calculation are already expected .",
    "note that chpt predicts @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which should be correct near threshold . however , experimental data are available for @xmath90 @xcite , which indicate @xmath91 and @xmath92 . thus ,",
    "unless the higher orders in the chiral expansion completely change the chpt result , somewhere between threshold and @xmath93 there must be a zero for both structure functions in the @xmath94 mode .",
    "this feature is absent in all the phenomenological models in the literature of which we are aware .",
    "we can not predict from the chiral expansion , whether these zeros will occur at very low energies or only a little below @xmath95 .",
    "we suggest a careful experimental examination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from @xmath96 downwards .",
    "let us summarize our main results .",
    "first , we predict that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are very similar at threshold .",
    "this has already been noted in phenomenological models , but we have shown that @xmath97 is actually a low energy theorem of qcd , which receives corrections only at next - to - next - to leading order .",
    "so the symmetry structure of qcd requires @xmath78 well beyond the very low energy region .",
    "second , near threshold we find a sign difference between the two charge modes for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . taking into account also the available experimental data in @xmath94 channel we conclude that in this channel both structure functions should have a zero somewhere between threshold and @xmath98 .",
    "this feature is absent in any of the phenomenological models of which we are aware , and its experimental verification would be the first evidence for the presence of the [ 300 ] partition state @xcite in tau decays into three pions .    with the same method we can calculate also the scalar part of the matrix element close to threshold .",
    "it turns out that , compared to the one loop prediction from chpt , this scalar part is underestimated , if present at all , in phenomenological models .",
    "a detailed analysis of this and other topics , such as the application of chpt to decays into two pions , is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "* @xmath99 final states .",
    "there are some discrepancies between experimental data and predictions using the `` chirally normalized vector meson dominance '' , or `` cn - vmd '' model for @xmath8 final states @xcite .",
    "prompted by this , we have started to systematically _ test _ the assumptions of the cn - vmd model , beginning with the simplest mode , i.e.the two pion final state .    a completely general ansatz for the relevant form factor @xmath100 is @xmath101 where the @xmath102 may indicate both higher resonances ( @xmath103 ,  ) and possible non - resonant contributions .",
    "we use breit - wigner resonance factors normalized to @xmath104 , @xmath105 the on - shell values of the various couplings can ( approximately ) be determined from experimental data , @xmath106 if we _ assume _ that the meson couplings are approximately constant from @xmath107 up to the relevant resonance masses , we find @xmath108 here we have used the experimental knowledge about the negative relative phase between the @xmath109 and the @xmath110 contributions . note that no reliable error estimates are possible here . for the value @xmath111 we get an error of @xmath112 from the uncertainty in @xmath113 , but",
    "the uncertainty from @xmath114 is unknown and might potentially be larger .",
    "we will now compare these results with the cn - vmd model .",
    "if we dominate with the @xmath109 only , we get @xmath115 compared to ( [ eqnfv ] ) , we find a @xmath116 discrepancy in the strength of the @xmath109 contribution .",
    "this has already been observed in @xcite .",
    "if , however , we include the first two resonances , we get @xmath117 where we have taken @xmath118 from the fit @xmath119 in @xcite , and with three resonances , we get ( fit @xmath120 in @xcite ) @xmath121 these numbers show that the cn - vmd model compares reasonably well with ( [ eqnfv ] ) , if the first two or three @xmath109 like states are included .",
    "this gives us some confidence that the cn - vmd model is indeed a good approximation .",
    "a more detailed study is in preparation @xcite .",
    "@xmath122 final states .",
    "there are two such final states , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which are related by isospin . due to",
    "@xmath125 , both @xmath126 and @xmath127 may contribute @xcite .",
    "relevant resonances with the correct quantum numbers are : @xmath128 in @xcite , we have constructed a model with includes both the @xmath129 and the @xmath130 .",
    "the relative strength @xmath131 of the @xmath129 in the vector channel was estimated from @xmath132 ( note that @xmath133 , which is consistent with @xmath134 flavor symmetry expectations ) , and the strength of the @xmath130 by matching to @xmath58 chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we found that the @xmath129 and the @xmath135 contribute with comparable strength ( both about 5% to the rate ) .",
    "thus one has to disentangle them using angular distributions , i.e.   by measuring @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath137 final states .",
    "some important tasks in these final states are to establish the presence of a scalar contribution and to measure its size , and to put upper limits on the @xmath110 contribution in two pion subresonances .",
    "@xmath138 and @xmath8 final states .",
    "as opposed to the case of the @xmath137 , here both the vector and the axial vector currents can contribute ( i.e.  both the @xmath139 and the @xmath110 , or both the @xmath140 and the @xmath141 ) .",
    "theoretical predictions for their ratio @xmath142 vary considerably @xcite .",
    "thus it should be measured , using angular distributions .",
    "understanding these decay modes may turn out to be very useful for measurements of possible non standard model cp - violation @xcite .",
    "this is because suitable interference terms between the vector and the axial vector contribution can be measured without polarized taus , and without knowledge of the @xmath9 rest frame ; and because the two interfering amplitudes ( vector and axial vector ) may have comparable strengths .",
    "another interesting issue regarding the @xmath8 final states are the two axial resonances with strangeness , the @xmath143 and the @xmath144 , which both can contribute here .",
    "we believe that there are good reasons to suspect that the @xmath140 widths given in the particle data book @xcite might be considerably too small @xcite .",
    "these reasons are : ( i ) otherwise the @xmath145 within the cn - vmd model turn out to be about a factor of @xmath146 too large . of course",
    ", the obvious thought is that this might be due to a failure of the cn - vmd model .",
    "however , due to the fact that most of the other predictions of the model for three meson final states agree reasonably well with data , and due to the various symmetry relations between the different three meson final states , we are actually unable to find any other natural explanation . this led us to suspect that indeed the true @xmath140 widths might be larger .",
    "( ii ) given that @xmath147 , the @xmath140 widths in @xcite appear unnaturally small .",
    "( iii ) experiments on which the numbers quoted in @xcite are based , have made the same assumptions for the parametrization of background amplitudes , which in the past yielded very small values for @xmath148 , and which subsequently were superseded by cleaner measurements of @xmath148 using @xmath9 decays .",
    "thus our conclusion is that one should _ measure _ the @xmath140 resonance parameters in @xmath149 . in fig .",
    "[ figk1 ] we show that indeed @xmath150 is very sensitive to the @xmath140 parameters .",
    "these issues will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "let us conclude by making some suggestions to experimentalists about what we believe to be interesting and feasible measurements .",
    "first , let us consider decays with three pions .",
    "we would suggest to measure @xmath1 and @xmath2 for both charge modes , @xmath94 and @xmath60 .",
    "these two structure functions might very well be different for the two modes .",
    "this would be the first evidence for the [ 300 ] partition class , which decays differently into @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "furthermore , we would like to urge to measure @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath3 less or nearly equal to @xmath153 for the @xmath151 charge mode .",
    "there is most probably a zero and a change of sign both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 in this mode , somewhere between @xmath154 .",
    "we also suggest to measure the scalar contribution via @xmath155 , and to try to put limits on the @xmath110 contribution in the two - pion subresonances .",
    "secondly , regarding @xmath149 , we suggest to measure the parameters of the @xmath140 resonances using this @xmath9 decay mode .",
