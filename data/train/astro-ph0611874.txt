    "recent studies of the multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) have demonstrated that the origin of small scale interstellar turbulence might be attributed to the thermally unstable nature of the ism itself @xcite . until recently , most theoretical work on interstellar turbulence has assumed that the ism is isothermal ( see for recent reviews , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this approximation has been imposed mainly because quiescent gas evolves almost isothermally at 10k as a result of the thermal balance between radiative heating and dust emission cooling where external uv radiation is well - shielded @xcite , and partly because of limited computational ability .",
    "detailed analyses of the one - dimensional collapse due to thermal instability can be found in , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the situation has changed since @xcite first pointed out that the thermally unstable nature of multi - phase ism is able to maintain the turbulent flows . since then , various attempts have been made to examine the properties of the multi - phase turbulent ism @xcite .",

    "tiny , cold and dense clumps were seen to move in the surrounding warm diffuse medium subsonically with respect to the warm medium , but supersonically to the sound speed in the cold clumps . in this article , we refer to this model as the `` two - phase model '' where two thermal states , i.e. , cold clumps and warm medium , are generated by thermal instability .",
    "similar conclusions have also been reached by other authors . among them",
    ", @xcite performed three dimensional simulations of a multi - phase medium and examined the evolution of kinetic energy of the resulting turbulence .",
    "@xcite simulated a two - dimensional converging flow , where the post - shock thermally unstable gas is continuously provided by the two shock waves that confine the post - shock gas .",
    "they showed that complex structures similar to those of @xcite are formed , and discussed their evolution by comparing cooling length , fragment scale of the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) , field length , and the typical size of the shocked layer . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have followed this line of work and discussed the observational signature as well . while the calculations above focus mainly on neutral atomic gas , @xcite examined molecular gas of much higher density ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) .",
    "they concluded that the gas is kept isothermal due to the fast reformation of the coolant molecules behind shock waves in the dense molecular clouds .    in this article , we concentrate on more diffuse gas ( @xmath9 @xmath8 ) , which is warmed by mild uv photoelectric heating , and focus on observational characteristics of the two - phase medium .",

    "in addition to existing telescopes equipped with submillimeter receivers , such as submillimeter array ( sma ) and atacama submillimeter telescope ( aste ) , the highly sensitive instruments of atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) will be available before long . we thus examine how a characteristic feature of the two - phase turbulence model should appear in observational quantities .",
    "we try to find and propose unambiguous and robust observational indicators for the two - phase turbulence model . for this purpose ,",
    "we perform hydrodynamical simulations of two - phase turbulent flows , and then calculate line emission of atomic carbons and co molecules . based on the synthetic emission maps , our results are more suitable for direct comparison with observation than the density or temperature distributions , which are provided by previous hydrodynamical simulations .",

    "we do not introduce the physical viscosity , which affects the saturation level of turbulent motions , because we are more interested in characteristic features in radiation field rather than detailed arguments on the mechanism for maintaining the turbulent motion .",

    "this explains the behavior of the isobaric line in figure [ fig : cii_co10_p ] , which turns downward with increasing density .      in this subsection",

    "the dependence of line ratios on rotational quantum number @xmath42 is surprisingly different for these two turbulent flow models .    in the one - phase model , the line ratios @xmath100 decrease with increasing @xmath42 , while this trend reverses in the two - phase model up to @xmath101 : in the one - phase model , although the co@xmath102 line is almost as strong as co@xmath69 line ( @xmath103 ) , higher @xmath42 lines become progressively weaker . on the other hand , in the two - phase model",
    ", the line ratio @xmath104 is as large as 2 and @xmath105 and @xmath106 become even larger .",
    "this can be explained by the following argument : since density is lower or at most marginally higher than the critical density ( @xmath107 ) in our snapshots , here we consider the low - density limit .",
    "in other words , we discuss the cases where the radiative decay from each level dominates all the collisional transitions both into and from this level , except the collisional excitation from the ground state . under this assumption , the equations of the detailed balance for the optically thin lines can be approximately described as @xmath108 for the ground level ( @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 for levels @xmath111 .",
    "the collisional excitation rate @xmath54 is written as in equation ( [ eq : cij ] ) . from these equations , we obtain @xmath112 equation ( [ eq : radrate ] ) implies that all the co molecules that are collisionally excited to the state @xmath42 cascade down to lower levels by spontaneous emission with @xmath113 .",

    "the [ ] line ratio becomes close to unity in the two - phase model , while it is significantly smaller than unity in the one - phase model .",
    "this behavior can be understood in a similar way to the argument for co rotational lines (  [ sect : coratio ] ) .",
    "again , we consider the low - density limit . in the following we call levels @xmath141 , @xmath140 , and @xmath139 levels 0 , 1 , and 2 , respectively . since the radiative transition from level 2 to 0 is negligible compared with that from level 2 to 1 , the equations for statistical balance read @xmath144 for level 1 , and @xmath145 for level 2 . from these equations and relations",
    "( [ eq : cij ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , the line ratio is given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 where we consider only collision with neutral hydrogen as for the excitation partner for numerical evaluation .",
    "the above expression clearly expresses that the line ratio becomes close to unity for @xmath148 ( as in the two - phase model ) , while for lower temperature ( as in the one - phase model of @xmath149k ) it decreases exponentially .",
    "we have demonstrated in this subsection that the intensity ratio @xmath150 of lines of high - transition energy ( @xmath151 100k ) and low - transition energy ( @xmath152 10k ) is as high as unity in the two - phase model , while @xmath150 is much smaller than unity in the 10k isothermal model .",
    "this feature is quite robust and is independent of the species of emitting particles ( atomic carbon or co molecule ) and the nature of transitions ( fine - structure transitions or rotational transitions ) .",
    "discussion in ",
    "[ sect : coratio ] explains the trend in line ratios in terms of the level population in low - density gas .",
    "the level populations are determined by collisional excitation and radiative de - excitation by spontaneous emission . in this case the number of particles that have enough energy for level excitation is proportional to @xmath153 , and then the level population reflects the ratio of transition energy and kinetic energy , @xmath154 .",
    "in other words , our results show that simultaneous observation of both high- and low - energy lines from the diffuse atomic / molecular transition region will reveal the thermal structures of the gas .",
    "if the high line ratio is observed in such regions in future , we can confirm the existence of two - phase turbulent flows . in the following section",
    ", we discuss the implications of our results for the co line ratio in more detail .",
    "we have assumed uniform abundance distribution both temporally and spatially for all the species .",
    "this assumption appears too artificial if we consider complex chemical reactions in the temperature range @xmath155k .",
    "actual chemical abundances in diffuse clouds will evolve both in space and time , reflecting the environments of the clouds and their evolutionary history , that is , the development of the multi - phase medium . in particular , whether co is present in such a diffuse environment is quite uncertain .",
    "since line intensity is proportional to the abundance of emitting species in an optically thin medium , the lack of co in the warm gas would reduce the co line intensity . in figure",
    "[ fig : linemapf_0012]a , one can see that warm ( @xmath156k ) gas occupies a large fraction of volume in the two - phase medium . in evaluating the co line intensity by integrating the emissivity along the line of sight ( or the @xmath75 axis in our analysis ) , we need to take into account the possible deficiency of co molecules in the warm phase .    to assess the extent of this effect on our results , we perform the following simple experiments : although formation and destruction rates of co molecules are dependent on various thermal factors , e.g. , density and temperature , the degree of depletion onto dust grains and so on in a complex fashion , it is plausible to assume that the abundance of co , @xmath157 increases with decreasing temperature and increasing density . in our two - phase model ,",
    "the whole region is approximately in pressure balance .",
    "thus higher density means lower temperature , and co abundance can be regarded as a function only of temperature , as long as chemical reactions of co are in equilibrium . as the simplest example , we assume that co is completely destroyed above a threshold temperature @xmath158 . namely , the co abundance @xmath157 is taken as a step function of temperature @xmath68 ; @xmath159 we take @xmath158 as a free parameter and examine the effect of different values @xmath158 on the line ratios . figure [ fig : th_eqf ]",
    "shows that the medium is thermally unstable in the range of 300k @xmath160 5000k .",
    "therefore the spread of temperature grows as large as this range in our two - phase flow calculations ( 50k @xmath160 3,700k ) .",
    "we study four cases of @xmath158 = 100k , 400k , 1000k , and 3000k , which correspond to @xmath161 , 10 , 4 , and 1.3 @xmath8 , respectively , under the saturation pressure @xmath162 k @xmath8 .",
    "we repeat the same analyses as in  3 for each of @xmath158 .    in figure [",
    "fig : co_ratio_tcut ] , we show the co(@xmath163)/co@xmath69 line ratios for different values of @xmath158 . with a decrease in @xmath158 ,",
    "the volume occupied by the warm phase ( where @xmath157 is set to be 0 ) drastically increases .",
    "radiation is emitted only from surviving cold clumps . in spite of a drastic increase in volume of the warm phase",
    ", the line ratios do not change significantly ( figure [ fig : co_ratio_tcut ] ) .",
    "this result is supported by our discussion in  [ sect : coratio ] that the line ratio of co rotational transitions depends only on the ratio of the excitation energy of the line @xmath164 , and the kinetic temperature of the gas @xmath165 , as long as density is low ( @xmath166 ) . as depicted by the isothermal lines in figure [ fig : th_eqf ] ,",
    "after the system settles onto a constant pressure around the saturation pressure @xmath167 , the lowest temperature of the two - phase model is as high as 50k in our calculation .",
    "this lowest temperature assures @xmath168 for @xmath169 ( @xmath170 55k ) , so that even in the coldest region in our two - phase model the line ratios @xmath100 exceed ( or are close to ) unity .",
    "since co molecules are preferentially formed in the dense strongly shielded clumps ( see also discussion in this section below ) , the temperature inside the cnm of the two - phase ism can be lower than our results owing to the resultant co cooling .",
    "in fact , according to @xcite , the thermal equilibrium temperature in cnm is as low as @xmath6 20k .",
    "the condition for high line ratio @xmath171 becomes more difficult to be satisfied in colder cnm : the line ratio is accordingly lowered .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath100 of higher @xmath42 is reduced , while @xmath104 stays the same as our results except in strongly shielded molecular clouds of 10k owing to the very low excitation energy only 16.5k . in this case",
    "we should use the line ratio @xmath100 of low @xmath42 lines to study the thermal structure of the cnm .",
    "the increase in the threshold temperature @xmath158 is accompanied by an increase in the average temperature @xmath68 in the emission region .",
    "since the line ratio @xmath100 grows larger as the average temperature @xmath68 increases (  [ sect : coratio ] ) , the shift of the threshold temperature @xmath158 does not alter the trend toward the averaged @xmath172 as long as @xmath173 .",
    "note that our simple experiments include two extreme cases of high- and low- @xmath157 values in the warm phase .",
    "thus we conclude that , as long as we are concerned with the line - ratio analysis presented in this article , the result is not significantly affected by complicated chemical evolution . in other words , the line ratio , not the intensity of each line , is a good observational tool for understanding the thermal structure of turbulent interstellar medium .",
    "since the chain reaction for formation of co molecules starts with a reaction involving h@xmath25 , the presence of h@xmath25 is a necessary condition for co formation .",
    "molecules are formed via association of two hydrogen atoms on the surface of dust grains .",
    "the formation timescale of h@xmath25 molecules is described as @xmath174 years ( @xcite ) .",
    "the formation timescale becomes on the order of @xmath175 years in the dense cold clumps , where @xmath176 @xmath8 .",
    "then if the dense clumps survive as long as @xmath175 years , co molecules can form inside .",
    "there are some arguments supporting the existence of co molecules in tenuous warm ism .",
    "recently , @xcite emphasized the importance of gas flows ( i.e. evaporation ) from cold phase to warm phase .",
    "if molecules are abundant inside the cold clouds , they will be dispersed into the warm phase .",
    "the efficient evaporation of co from cold clumps enables the supply of co molecules to the warm gas on a relatively short timescale , although the chemical timescale is much longer than other relevant timescales in the warm phase . of course ,",
    "if the uv radiation is as intense as in average diffuse ism , such co molecules would be photodissociated immediately .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative model for cold molecular clouds that possess warm gas deep inside . in this picture",
    ", co molecules can avoid photodissociation within such warm neutral medium ( wnm ) because external uv radiation is blocked by the surrounding cold molecular gas . in this scenario ,",
    "the condition @xmath177 is satisfied for co molecules in wnm .",
    "here we discuss two possible evolutionary scenarios for co abundance in diffuse ism .",
    "first , we consider the case of relatively strong interstellar uv radiation , stronger than the adopted value ( @xmath178 in our article ) .",
    "if there were a large number of fuv photons , co molecules would be easily photodissociated .",
    "the shielding of uv photons by atomic and molecular hydrogen and dust grains would result in selective destruction of co molecules in the tenuous warm medium , but co molecules in dense , cold clumps , surrounded by a warm medium , would be protected against uv penetration .",
    "another possibility is that a strong uv field might thermally stabilize the medium at a single warm phase @xcite . in this case , however , co molecules would not be able to survive photodissociation and co line emission would be very weak , even though there are some turbulent flows .",
    "the survey observations of molecular clouds in the galactic plane suggest that the number of regions of high - line ratio @xmath179 is small @xcite .",
    "these results might be interpreted as a signature of the lack of initial co molecules by photodissociation .",
    "if this is the case , more refractory molecules must be used as tracers of the two - phase medium . in order to examine",
    "what transitions can be better tracers , it is necessary to include greater detail of chemical evolution in our hydrodynamical simulations , as well as of the evolution of the main cooling and heating sources . ) describes the cooling rate of [ ] 158 @xmath3 m line , the major coolant in tenuous ism with which we are concerned in this article .",
    "] second , we consider the case of weak uv irradiation as we have considered in this article . in our two - phase models",
    ", the temperatures do not exceed @xmath180 5000k , and co molecules once formed are not subject to the collisional dissociation . in this case ,",
    "our experiments in this subsection are straightforwardly applicable and the ratio of rotational transitions of co molecules is a good probe of thermal structure in the turbulent ism .",
    "the effective cooling function we adopted ( equation [ eq : fitting ] ) was calculated under the condition of small visual extinction , @xmath181 .",
    "this environment corresponds to the periphery of molecular clouds where the composition of carbon changes from atomic to molecular form .",
    "@xcite found peculiar structures in the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram around @xmath182 in their observations of co@xmath69 in taurus hcl2 , which spans over a wide range of @xmath183 .",
    "tiny clumps with sharp velocity gradients of radius @xmath184pc suddenly appeared when @xmath183 fell below unity in all of three observed strips .",
    "they speculated that these structures were cold dense clumps formed by thermal instability since this instability under mild uv heating occurred approximately around @xmath185 . in figure",
    "[ fig : co_pv ] we display the synthetic p - v diagram of co@xmath69 line from the snapshots of the simulations at 3 myr .",
    "the two - phase model shows that velocity of clumpy structures spreads over a wide range ( @xmath186 5 km sec@xmath23 ) .",
    "indeed , our synthetic p - v diagram of the two - phase model looks quite similar to that of @xcite at @xmath1871 . since our simulations do not consistently include the spatial variation of uv shielding in modeling periphery of molecular clouds , direct comparison with these observational results should be done with caution .",
    "this similarity is , however , quite encouraging for confirming our two - phase model driven by uv photoelectric heating .",
    "iram observations of starless molecular clouds also suggest the possibility that tiny gas clumps are filling the beam @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "in more diffuse regions in the galactic plane , iso observations of h@xmath25 rotational lines suggest the existence of collisionally heated warm gas ( @xmath155k ) within the cold diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "although both of the observed regions are denser than our calculations , their structures might be roughly consistent with the two - phase medium models generated by uv photoelectric heating @xcite or dissipative heating of alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "we can clarify the nature of the multi - phase ism by making comparisons with line - emission calculations like ours and such detailed observations of diffuse ism as described above .",
    "despite our conclusion that the two - phase medium has a high line - ratio @xmath188    @xmath189 1.0 , observations have found that regions of high line - ratio @xmath190 @xmath191 @xmath192 1.0 are of limited fraction @xcite and usually only appear close to hii regions .",
    "our results of high @xmath104 values are in part due to the assumption of small optical thickness ( @xmath193 1 ) .",
    "if we included the effect of finite optical thickness , the line ratio @xmath104 averaged over the simulation box would become smaller .",
    "however , as for the peripheral regions , which are optically thin , our treatment is still valid and our conclusions should not be altered .",
    "discrepancy between existing observations and our prediction is probably due to the fact that observations tend to be strongly biased to clouds with high co intensity , thus having higher average density compared with the transition regions we discussed .",
    "to observationally examine the atomic / molecular transition regions , we must take care not to include both high and low co intensity regions in a single observing beam in resolving the spatial gradient of @xmath183 .",
    "for this purpose , observations not only with high angular resolution but also with high sensitivity are needed for achieving high s / n observation of faint transition regions , avoiding contamination of high intensity regions .",
    "we hope that future instruments will provide a good information for the two - phase scenario of ism turbulence .    here",
    "we discusss some of the characteristics of the cold clumps analyzed in this paper and future observation .",
    "the typical size of the cold clumps is determined by the maximum growth wavelength in thermally unstable medium @xmath194 @xcite , where @xmath195 is the field length , and @xmath196 is the cooling length , respectively . numerically these values are    @xmath197    where @xmath198 is cooling rate per particle , and the normalizations are taken from typical values in our calculation .",
    "if tiny cold clumps reside at the distance of nearby molecular clouds @xmath199 140pc , the angular size of a clump of radius @xmath200au is @xmath201 . from figures [ fig : co_ratio ] , [ fig : ci_ratio ] and equation ( [ eq : integ ] ) intensities of co(@xmath202 ) and [ ] lines of the two - phase medium",
    "are @xmath203 erg sec@xmath23 @xmath36 str@xmath23 in our calculations ( where @xmath80 is the total length scale of the two - phase medium along the line of sight ) .",
    "this intensity value corresponds to the brightness temperature @xmath204k ( @xmath205)k , and is too weak to be detected with alma telescope unless the line - of - sight length of the cloud is sufficiently large ( alma sensitivity calculator ) , even though its high angular resolution is sufficient for resolving each tiny clump .",
    "this might suggest that we should target near - by clouds such as some of the high latitude clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition to the weak average intensity , the volume filling factor of the tiny cnm clumps of which intensity dominates , is much less than unity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linemapf_0012 ] ) . taking into account of these difficulties",
    ", we should be careful in the interpretation of the observations for the tiny cnm clumps in the diffuse two - phase ism even with alma .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : co_pv ] shows that the tiny clump - like structures are assembled into larger structures of @xmath206 0.1 pc when integrated along a line of sight in the p - v diagram .",
    "the flux density of such assembly is @xmath207 which might be observable with a future telescope equipped with highly sensitive receivers . for better evaluation of the intensity",
    ", we need to study the global structure of the atomic / molecular transition region which supposedly consists of the tiny clump - like structures appeared in our simulations .",
    "such a global modelling is beyond the scope of this paper , but should be included in future simulations .    when future highly sensitive multi-@xmath42 line observations of `` peculiar '' structures with typical size @xmath6 0.1pc detected in the strip - scanned co(@xmath202 ) data ( @xcite ; see  4.2.1 ) are available , they will greatly improve our understandings of their origin and identity . in those rims of molecular clouds with @xmath208",
    ", even smaller structures might be found with future deep observations .",
    "small ( @xmath206 0.1 pc ) structures with high - line ratio in imaging observations would be the best verification of the two - phase ism turbulence models and of the formation scenarios of molecular clouds based on the multi - phase turbulence models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed observations using forthcoming powerful instruments will reveal the thermal structure in diffuse interstellar medium , as well as in dense molecular clouds .",
    "we hope our calculation of the carbon line ratio would be a prototype to study the nature of ism using forthcoming high quality observational data .",
    "we examined observational characteristics of the two - phase turbulence model by combining hydrodynamical simulations and radiation calculations .",
    "we modeled the diffuse interstellar medium irradiated by uv radiation of @xmath10 , attenuated with an average visual extinction of @xmath209 . in our model settings ,",
    "the two - phase structures are formed by photoelectric heating , and therefore our model corresponds to the atomic / molecular transition region at the periphery of dense molecular clouds . in order to examine such transition regions ,",
    "we calculated line intensities based on nonlte level populations for three species of carbon , c@xmath1 , c@xmath33 , and co. by comparing two line intensities of high- and low- temperature tracers , we found that the line ratio @xmath150 distinctly reflects the thermal structure of the medium .",
    "the results of our analyses showed that , in the two - phase model , higher transition energy lines can be stronger than those of lower energy as long as @xmath177 .",
    "our argument on the level population in low - density limit ( @xmath166 ) demonstrated that the line ratio of high- and low- temperature tracers are determined by the ratio of transition energy and gas kinetic energy , @xmath154 .",
    "in addition to uniform abundance calculations , we also analyzed cases where co is dissociated above a threshold temperature , or equivalently , below a threshold density .",
    "our analyses showed that abundance distribution of co molecules in the warm phase does not significantly affect the high line ratio that characterize the two - phase model , as long as co molecules are not completely photodissociated .",
    "this is because , even in the coldest regions in our two - phase model , the temperature is as high as 50k ( @xmath210 , the energy level of @xmath211 of the co rotational transition ) , and satisfies @xmath177 . by seeking these features in the diffuse atomic / molecular transition regions",
    ", we will be able to confirm the existence of two - phase interstellar turbulence by using the high angular resolution and high sensitivity of future instruments .",
    "we greatly appreciate k. tomisaka , k. wada , and s. miyama for their useful comments on the performance of our analyses , and s. sakamoto for discussions about observations of diffuse interstellar clouds .",
    "we also thank k. sakamoto for his helpful comments on interferometer observations .",
