    "the richardson - gaudin ( rg ) exactly solvable models @xcite can be traced back to the exact solution of the bcs hamiltonian given by richardson in the early 1960 s @xcite and to the integrable spin model developed by gaudin in the seventies @xcite .",
    "they are diagonalizable by bethe ansatz techniques and are the so - called classical limit of two dimensional vertex models .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , where the connection between the rg models and the inhomogeneous xxx vertex model with twisted boundary conditions is established in detail for the case of the rank-1 su(2 ) algebra .",
    "previously , in @xcite it was shown that the solution of the gaudin models [ those without linear term in the integrals of motion , cf.([integ ] ) below ] associated with more general lie algebras , can be used to get a solution of the corresponding classical yang - baxter equations ( cybe ) .",
    "this connection has been largely exploited to diagonalize the rg models ( see @xcite for some examples ) . in practice",
    "this method consists of using the already known solutions of the general - lie - algebra yang - baxter equations ( obtained by using the quantum inverse scattering method ) to obtain the corresponding solution of the rg models by taking the classical limit of the respective bethe equations . from a conformal field theory context , asorey , falceto and sierra @xcite obtained the integrals of motion and respective eigenvalues of the rational rg models for any simple lie algebra as a limiting case of the chern - simons theory .",
    "here we follow an alternative and more direct approach to diagonalize the rg models .",
    "though essentially equivalent , it differs in practice .",
    "this approach , where no reference to the ybe is necessary , is similar to the presented by ushveridze @xcite for the rational case .",
    "the method is based on the introduction of an infinite dimensional algebra ( the gaudin algebra ) associated with the lie - algebra of a simple group . by taking a casimir - like operator in the gaudin algebra ,",
    "one gets the transfer matrix of the ybe approach and , consequently , a set of independent quadratic integrals of motion . in @xcite",
    "this formalism was extended to the trigonometric and hyperbolic cases for the rank-1 algebras su(2 ) and su(1,1 ) . in this contribution",
    "we extend the gaudin algebra to the trigonometric and hyperbolic cases for any simple lie algebra .    as an application of the method",
    ", we work out in detail the rg models associated with the rank-2 su(3 ) algebra .",
    "most of the physical applications of the rg models presented so far are based on the rank-1 algebras su(2 ) or su(1,1 ) .",
    "they cover a wide variety of physical problems ranging from pairing hamiltonains for fermion or boson systems @xcite , to spin models or generalized tavis - cumming models @xcite .",
    "recently , some applications to physical problems of rg models based on higher rank algebras have been published .",
    "the detailed derivation of the exact solution was considered for the so(5 ) algebra of proton - neutron pairing in @xcite and with more generality including numerical applications in @xcite . in @xcite the rg model based on the non - compact so(3,2 ) algebra is used in the context of the interacting boson model ii , which describes the interaction between two different species of bosons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) for each non - degenerated level . in @xcite the su(4 )",
    "rg models are used to describe the interaction between two superconducting systems . here",
    "we discuss different physical scenarios of potential interest , associated with the su(3 ) rg models .",
    "they include dipole - dipole interactions between three level atoms , isospinorial pairing and generalized tavis - cummings models of three level atoms interacting with two different bosonic modes @xcite .",
    "contrary to rank-1 rg models , in higher rank algebras the number of independent integrals of motion is not exhausted by those obtained from the quadratic casimir - like operators .",
    "more integrals of motion can be obtained by considering higher degree operators .",
    "unfortunately , as it was shown in @xcite , the casimir - like analogy to obtain integrals of motions is valid up to degree - three casimir operators .",
    "more general formulae are needed to get integrals of motion of degree greater than three @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since the su(3 ) algebra has two independent casimir operators of degree two and three respectively , the casimir - like analogy can be used to obtain the complet set of integrals of motion . in this contribution",
    "it is verified that , for the rational su(3 ) rg models , the number of independent integrals of motion coincides with the number of quantum degrees of freedom as defined in @xcite . for other higher - rank algebras , which have at least quartic casimir operators , the more general formulae of @xcite are needed to obtain the complete set of integrals of motion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section two , the general gaudin algebra and quadratric",
    "casimir - like operators are introduced .",
    "a particular realization of the gaudin algebra in terms of a direct product of @xmath2 lie algebra copies and complex valuated functions is introduced .",
    "the conditions to be satisfied by these functions are established , which are a generalization of the gaudin conditions of the su(2 ) case .",
    "three particular solutions to the gaudin conditions are found ( rational , trigonometric and hyperbolic ) and it is shown how to obtain the corresponding sets of quadratic integrals of motion from the casimir - like gaudin operator .",
    "special interest is paid to the introduction of a linear term in the integrals of motion through the addition of a constant shift to the cartan members of the gaudin algebra .",
    "explicit formulae for the quadratic integrals of motion and their eigenvalues are given .",
    "in section three , focusing on the su(3 ) algebra , we apply the formalism of section two to obtain closed expressions for the quadratic integrals of motion and their eigenvalues in the more general scenario of arbitrary su(3 ) irreducible representations . as discussed above , in order to satisfy the condition of integrability more integrals of motion are needed , which must be at least cubic in the generators . for the rational version we present new sets of integrals of motion coming from the casimir - like gaudin operator of degree three , and it is verified that the total number of quantum constants of motion coincides with the number of quantum degrees of freedom . in section four , the physical meaning of the variables appearing in the integrals of motion and eigenvalues",
    "is discussed for different su(3 ) physical realizations .",
    "additionally , the limit of infinite degeneracy for a copy of the su(3 ) algebra is used to get a family of integrals of motion related to a generalized tavis - cummings model for three level atoms interacting with two species of bosonic excitations .",
    "conclusion are given in the last section .",

    "this model is derived from the trigonometric version of the previous section in two steps : first we take the bosonic mapping of one copy of the su(3 ) algebra ( let us say the copy @xmath210 ) , and then we let the degeneracy @xmath211 of this bosonized copy go to infinite .",
    "we assume the su(3 ) irrep @xmath212 for the copy to be bosonized . in this case",
    "the bosonic mapping for the su(3 ) algebra is @xcite :    @xmath213    where @xmath214 and @xmath215 are boson operators .",
    "this mapping is hermitic , therefore the mapping of the operators @xmath216 with @xmath90 can be obtained by conjugating the previous ones . in the limit @xmath217 the previous mapping",
    "is reduced to : @xmath218 where the imaginary factor @xmath219 is introduced for future convenience .",
    "we consider now the trigonometric integrals of the rg model ( [ integsu3tr ] ) for a system of @xmath220 copies of the lie algebra : @xmath221 .",
    "then we bosonize the copy with the `` 0 '' label using ( [ mapbos ] ) . in order to avoid divergences in taking the limit @xmath217",
    ", we define a new set of variables @xmath222 by using the freedom we have to choose the parameters @xmath20 .",
    "these new variables are defined through : @xmath223 from this definition and the trigonometric identity ( @xmath224 , it is easy to show that in the limit @xmath225 : @xmath226 by substituting these results in the trigonometric integrals @xmath227 and @xmath48([integsu3tr ] ) , we obtain : @xmath228 where we have rescaled the operators @xmath227 and @xmath48 ( @xmath229 @xmath230 @xmath231 and @xmath232 @xmath230 @xmath233 ) , dropped the terms with inverse powers of @xmath234 , and defined new variables : @xmath235 the constants in the integrals of motion ( [ bosinteg ] ) are @xmath236 and @xmath237 .    to obtain the eigenvalues of the previous operators , we take the eigenvalues ( [ evaluesu3 ] ) , with @xmath238 and @xmath239 substituted by cotangent functions , and then the limit @xmath217",
    "before performing this limit we introduce , as we did in ( [ defa ] ) , two new sets of variables associated with the parameters @xmath148 and @xmath240 : @xmath241 the same trigonometric identity that yields ( [ defa2 ] ) allows us to write the limit @xmath217 of the following functions : @xmath242 where we have used the definition ( [ defa ] ) . with the limit values of the previous cotangent functions , the eigenvalues ( [ evaluesu3 ] )",
    "become : @xmath243 which are the eigenvalues of the operators ( [ bosinteg ] ) .",
    "note that the term @xmath244 , that diverges in the limit @xmath217 , appears explicitly both in the operator and its eigenvalue , then we can easily get rid of it .",
    "@xmath222 are free parameters and the variables @xmath245 and @xmath246 are solutions of the richardson - bethe equations in the limit @xmath217 . to derive them",
    ", we consider the richardson - bethe equations in the trigonometric case , which can be read from equations ( [ richeqsu3-a ] ) and ( [ richeqsu3-b ] ) with @xmath247 substituted by cotangent functions .",
    "then , using ( [ newset ] ) we obtain : @xmath248 note that the resulting richardson - bethe equations are identical to those in the rational case except by the linear term in the first line .",
    "the integrals of motion ( [ noverall ] ) are now : @xmath249 the physical meaning of the dynking labels @xmath180 and @xmath250 is not modified by the introduction of the bosons , and it is the same already discussed above . the number of parameters @xmath245 and @xmath246 ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) in the richardson - bethe equations ( [ richeqsbo ] ) can be obtained from the general formula ( [ limitesu3 ] ) , by extending the sum to the bosonized copy , and noting that the young labels associated with it are @xmath251=[\\omega_0,0,0]$ ] .",
    "one of the simplest hamiltonian that can be derived from the previous integrals of motion , is obtained by considering just one non - bosonized copy of the su(3 ) algebra .",
    "therefore @xmath252 and we have 2 integrals of motion : @xmath227 and @xmath253 . by taking a linear combination of these integrals",
    "we arrive to : @xmath254 where @xmath216 are the generators of the non - bosonized copy .",
    "the parameters of the hamiltonian are related to the rg parameters by : @xmath255 and the constants @xmath256 and @xmath257 are : @xmath258 with @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "the previous hamiltonian describes the interaction between a set of @xmath261 identical three level atoms and two modes of the electric field in the so called rotating - wave - approximation @xcite , and is a generalized version of the tavis - cummings model for three level atoms .",
    "if we write the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltc ] ) in the particle - particle representation , we obtain the interaction between a doublet of pairs and a doublet of bosons : @xmath262 where we have redefined the bosons @xmath263 , @xmath264 , and the scalar product , @xmath265 , is @xmath266 .",
    "more complex hamiltonians can be derived from the integrals ( [ bosinteg ] ) , but we will not discuss them here .",
    "in this contribution we introduced a gaudin algebra valid for any simple lie algebra in the rational , trigonometric , and hyperbolic cases . with this algebra",
    ", we derived the complete set of quadratic rg integrals of motion , and found their respective eigenvalues . focusing this formalism on the rank - two su(3 ) algebra",
    ", we worked out in detail the rg models . for the rational case ,",
    "expressions for the integrals of motion of degree three were obtained , and it was verified that their number is the necessary to match the number of integrals of motion with the number of degrees of freedom of the quantum model .",
    "some physical applications of the su(3 ) models were discussed .",
    "the physical meaning of the variables in the rg formalism were discussed for two different representations of the su(3 ) algebra , namely , the particle - hole representation and the particle - particle one . by taking the trigonometric version of the models",
    ", we derived a new family of integrable models which are related to a generalization of the tavis - cummings model to three level atoms and two bosons .",
    "it was out of the scope of this contribution to explore all the possible physical applications of the su(3 ) rg models , some examples were given and others are expected to come .",
    "we think that we have put the ground for more detailed studies , such as numerical studies of the solutions and comparison with approximative techniques in physical scenarios beyond the limits of traditional diagonalization methods .",
    "the formalism presented here can be easily applied to other lie algebras .",
    "some physically relevant examples are the su(4 ) and so(5 ) versions in the description of high temperature superconductors @xcite , the so(8 ) version for isovector - isoscalar pairing @xcite , and the su(n ) versions which include generalized tavis - cummings models for @xmath179-levels atoms interacting with @xmath267 different bosonic modes .",
    "the formalism can likewise be extended to the elliptic rg models , where no linear term in the quadratic integrals of motion is allowed .",
    "another interesting extension of the present contribution is to derive more general solutions to the gaudin conditions ( [ gaud1 ] ) , using the very well studied solutions to the classical yang - baxter equations @xcite . finally , the higher rank rg models can be useful to shed some light in the non completely well established definition of number of degrees of freedom in finite quantum systems . in this contribution",
    ", the definition of integrability coming from the yang - baxter equation was linked to the one coming from the equality between the number of quantum degrees of freedom and the number of independent integrals of motion .",
    "this latter definition , initially supposed to be exclusively related to dynamical symmetric models , can be extended , as shown in this contribution , to the rg models , which are not necessarily dynamical symmetric .",
