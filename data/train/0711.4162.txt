    "in the forthcoming years , energies ranging from several hundreds gev to few tev s are expected to become accessible at the particle accelerators , a progress which will facilitate testing various fundamental theoretical concepts . in particular , it is quite possible that some of the elementary high - spin particles predicted by supersymmetric- , or , excited - lepton theories could be observed either as gauge fields to some still unknown non - abelian groups , or , as matter fields .",
    "additional effects may or may not come from the more recently developed respective theories of large extra dimensions , non - commutative space - time etc . in view of the theoretical uncertainties it appears quite important indeed to single out the impact of the first principles underlying the space - time on the properties of the elementary high - spin fields and in first place on their electromagnetic properties . as an example one may think of the value of the gyromagnetic factor , @xmath3 . in recent time , voicing universality of the @xmath4 value for particles of any spin becomes stronger ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for a recent review ) .",
    "an indirect indication in favor of @xmath4 is provided already by the drell - hearn - gerasimov sum rule @xcite ( generalized by weinberg @xcite to any spin ) which assigns to strong interactions the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon in terms of the @xmath8 difference .",
    "ferrara , porrati and telegdy made the point @xcite that unitarity of the amplitude of compton scattering off a target of _ any spin _",
    "@xmath9 demands for the universal value of @xmath4 .",
    "specifically for spin-@xmath10 , they showed that @xmath4 also allows to avoid the pathology of acausal propagation @xcite of such particles within an electromagnetic environment as suffered by the rarita - schwinger formalism .",
    "however , the resolution of this so called velo - zwanziger problem was obtained at the cost of the introduction of _ non - minimal _ electromagnetic couplings .",
    "in contrast to the ferrara , porrati and telegdy approach , in the recently proposed covariant projector formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , spin-@xmath10 causal propagation and @xmath4 were achieved by means of a lagrangian containing _ only minimal _ couplings but of _ second order _ in the momenta .",
    "the latter formalism treats high - spins as appropriate sectors of finite - dimensional multi - spin valued hlg representations that behave as invariant eigensubspaces of the two casimir operators of the poincar group , the squared four momentum , @xmath11 , and the squared pauli - lubanski vector , @xmath12 .",
    "it is the goal of the present study to apply the covariant projector formalism to fields residing in the @xmath13 irreducible representation of the hlg , the massive vector fields , and explore consequences on their electromagnetic couplings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we briefly review the covariant projector framework of ref .",
    "@xcite with the emphasis on the @xmath1 representation of the hlg and work out the electromagnetic interactions . in section iii",
    "we calculate the cross section for compton scattering off a vector target . in section",
    "iv we discuss our results within the light of the abelian and non - abelian contributions to the tree level electromagnetic couplings of arbitrary gauge fields .",
    "the paper ends with brief conclusions and has one appendix .",
    "vector fields , @xmath14 , have been previously studied by several authors with the emphasis on their electromagnetic properties .",
    "recently , it was pointed out in @xcite that @xmath4 is required to avoid appearance of divergent @xmath15 terms in the radiative decay interferences for polarized vector mesons , with @xmath16 standing for the photon energy . on the other side , proca s theory goes with a fixed @xmath17 value and it is not very clear how to reconcile it with @xmath4 except for the @xmath18 boson , the gauge particle of the electroweak @xmath19 group .",
    "the construction of the interacting @xmath20 lagrangian is quite intricate indeed .",
    "the minimally gauged proca lagrangian is complemented by a lagrangian of the same proca form but based on the non - abelian field tensor @xcite .",
    "the contribution of @xmath17 of the former is then enhanced precisely by the required one unit through the latter after @xmath21 spontaneous symmetry breaking , to give @xmath4 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a textbook presentation ) . here , @xmath22 stands for the electromagnetic gauge group . in this manner",
    ", the gyromagnetic ratio of the @xmath18 boson is equally partitioned into abelian and non - abelian contributions .",
    "such a symmetrical partition is not likely to be universal , although in the special case of the @xmath18 boson some unification theories seem to preserve it @xcite .",
    "however , for different vector gauge bosons , the new non - abelian theories throughout may provide larger or lesser non - abelian contributions to @xmath3 . within this context",
    ", it is desirable to have a scheme for the description of vector fields that goes beyond proca s formalism and allows to end up with a @xmath4 for any vector particle irrespective of its nature , abelian or non - abelian .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in the present work we derive such a scheme and prove that the electromagnetic couplings at tree level of _ any _ massive elementary vector particle are completely fixed by the three fundamental principles of ( i ) poincar symmetry of space time , ( ii ) @xmath23 gauge symmetry , and ( iii ) unitarity . modifications to this picture can arise only at one loop level due to electromagnetic corrections or diagrams involving interactions with other fields .",

    "one then needs additional physical input . as such we consider compton scattering off a vector target and demand finite total cross section in the high - energy limit in order to respect the unitarity bounds .",
    "taking this path allows us to completely fix the electromagnetic couplings of any elementary vector particle at tree level .",
    "in fact , there is no freedom left any more in the lagrangian designed to account for all possible terms containing @xmath28 anti - commutators , terms that are notoriously missed by the proca theory .      in ref .",

    "in this way the so called velo - zwanziger problem of superluminal propagation of spin-@xmath10 fields within an electromagnetic environment as suffered by the rarita - schwinger formalism @xcite was resolved and the solution related to the value of the gyromagnetic factor .",
    "also in this case , the nature of the particle , abelian versus non - abelian , was irrelevant to the solution .",
    "on the other side , it is well known that non - abelian gauge theories contain `` non - minimal '' electromagnetic interactions ( see @xcite and references therein ) which contribute to the net electromagnetic couplings of gauge bosons . in order to understand our results within the latter context",
    "let us consider the case of the electroweak @xmath110 bosons for which the partition of its gyromagnetic ratio into abelian and non - abelian contributions is well known @xcite .",
    "in that regard it is important to recall that the photon field , @xmath111 , is not among the four gauge bosons , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , of the @xmath114 group but partakes both @xmath113 and @xmath115 according to @xmath116 in standard notations .",
    "as long as the abelian field @xmath113 belongs to @xmath117 , while the non - abelian isovector field @xmath118 is associated with @xmath119 , the abelian contribution to the electromagnetic interactions of the @xmath18 take their origin from @xmath117 gauging while the non - abelian ones arise from the @xmath119 gauging , both in combination with @xmath120 ( @xmath121 stands for the universal electroweak coupling ) .",
    "the three physical massive gauge bosons @xmath110 , and @xmath122 emerge only after spontaneous @xmath123 breaking and it is only at this level that one can identify their corresponding electromagnetic interactions . what one observes is a partition of the gyromagnetic ratio in two sectors , the non - abelian one , @xmath124 , as provided by the non - abelian field tensor , and the abelian one , @xmath7 , coming from the abelian @xmath117 gauging .",
    "the @xmath125 value required by the specifics of the electroweak gauge group coincides by chance with the one provided by proca theory , so that using proca s lagrangian in the standard model is of no harm .",
    "however , for any other gauge group , that provides a @xmath126 , this concept will necessarily collapse . for a general non - abelian theory , based on a group , call it @xmath127 , and different from the electroweak one ,",
    "@xmath23 will manifest itself only after the spontaneous @xmath128 breaking at low energies . concerning physics beyond the standard model both aspects are completely unknown , so far .",
    "apparently , the respective @xmath6 value will depend both on the @xmath23 embedding in @xmath127 and on the details of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and can be lesser or bigger than @xmath0 .",
    "it is obvious that proca s theory is not applicable to this case .",
    "instead , one can make use of the lagrangian with the free @xmath3 parameter as defined by eqs .",
    "( [ gammag ] ) and ( [ lagg ] ) and employ it , this time at the level _ before _ the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "fixing @xmath129 to @xmath7 guarantees @xmath130 for any needed partition of the net gyromagnetic ratio at the final stage .    what after all should be abundantly clear is that whatever the unknown group @xmath127 , the @xmath22 embedding in it , or the mechanisms for the spontaneous symmetry breaking might be , with the lagrangian defined by eqs .",
    "( [ gammag ] ) and ( [ lagg ] ) one can always end up with a net gyromagnetic ratio of @xmath131 for a vector gauge boson . at any rate",
    ", the three first principles mentioned above must be respected by the final form of the interaction of the vector particle with the electromagnetic field and the respective electromagnetic properties concluded here will always hold valid .",
    "in this work we studied the structure of the lagrangian of an elementary vector particle ( massive particle transforming in the @xmath132 representation of the hlg ) interacting with an electromagnetic field .",
    "the lagrangian s derivation was based on the three fundamental principles of ( i ) poincar invariance of space - time , ( ii ) @xmath23 gauge symmetry of electromagnetism , and ( iii ) unitarity bounds for the compton scattering cross section .",
    "the first two principles lead to a general lagrangian depending on two free parameters , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 , both required in the definition of the four electromagnetic multipoles characterizing a vector particle . requiring the total cross section for compton scattering off a vector target to respect the unitarity bounds in the high - energy limit",
    "allows to fix the free parameters to @xmath4 , @xmath5 and thereby to determine the tree level electromagnetic properties of _ any _ vector particle , be it abelian or non - abelian .",
    "it must have a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath99 ( a gyromagnetic ratio of @xmath4 ) , an electric quadrupole moment of @xmath100 , and vanishing electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments at tree level .",
    "modifications to this picture can arise only at one - loop level either through higher order electromagnetic effects , or , through electromagnetic corrections induced by interactions with other particles . for gauge vector bosons",
    "the electromagnetic couplings are partitioned into non - abelian ( @xmath6 ) and abelian ( @xmath129 ) contributions obeying the restriction , @xmath130 .",
    "the specific respective @xmath129 , and @xmath6 values depend on the gauge group @xmath127 , the embedding of @xmath23 in it , and the details of the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath133 at low energies .",
    "the results obtained here are valid for elementary vector particles , i.e. , massive spin-@xmath0 particles transforming in the @xmath134 representation of the hlg as is the case of the @xmath18 boson .",
    "this is certainly not the only possible hlg representation for the description of spin-@xmath0 though the one of the widest spread , and it would be interesting to check validity of the concepts presented here for spin-@xmath0 fields transforming in other representations such as the totally anti - symmetric second rank tensor , @xmath135 , ( considered in @xcite ) , or , the totally symmetric one , @xmath136 ( considered , among others , in  @xcite ) .",
    "although we expect the calculation to evolve similarly to the one presented here , the new problems need to be worked out anew , a task that is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "finally , another challenge for future research would be to explore within the context of the covariant projector formalism the link between @xmath4 and the renormalizability of an effective field theory as found in ref .",
