    "solutions with degenerate metric were a subject of a long - standing discussions starting probably with the paper by einstein and rosen@xcite . in spite of",
    "some difficulty interpreting solutions with degenerate metric in classical theory of gravitation , the prevailing view was that they have physical meaning and must be included in the path integral@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "as it was shown in refs.@xcite,@xcite , in the first order formulation of an appropriately extended general relativity , solutions with @xmath10 can describe changes of the space - time topology .",
    "similar idea is realized also in the ashtekar s variables@xcite,@xcite .",
    "there are known also classical solutions@xcite-@xcite with change of the signature of the metric tensor .",
    "the space - time regions with @xmath11 can be treated as having _",
    "metrical dimension _ @xmath12 ( using terminology by tseytlin@xcite ) .",
    "the simplest solution with @xmath11 is @xmath1 while the affine connection is arbitrary ( or , in the einstein - cartan formulation , the vierbein @xmath13 and @xmath14 is arbitrary ) .",
    "such solutions have been studied by dauria and regge@xcite , tseytlin@xcite ) , witten@xcite , horowitz@xcite , giddings@xcite , baados@xcite ; it has been suggested that @xmath1 should be interpreted as essentially non - classical phase in which diffeomorphism invariance is unbroken and it is realized at high temperature and curvature .",
    "now we would like to bring up a question : whether the equality @xmath11 really with a necessity means that the dimension of the space - time manifold in a small neighborhood of the point @xmath15 may become @xmath12 ? at first sight",
    "it should be so because the volume element is @xmath16 note that the latter is the `` metrical '' volume element , and the possibility to describe the volume of the space - time manifold in this way appears after the 4-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath17 is equipped with the metric structure . for a solution with @xmath18 , the situation with description of the space - time becomes even worse .",
    "however , in spite of lack of the metric , the manifold @xmath17 may still possess a nonzero volume element and have the dimension @xmath19 .",
    "the well known way to realize it consists in the construction of a differential 4-form build for example by means of four differential 1-forms @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 .",
    "each of the 1-forms @xmath20 may be defined by a scalar field @xmath23 .",
    "the appropriate volume element of the 4-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath17 can be represented in the following way @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the volume measure independent of @xmath6 as opposed to the case of the metrical volume measure @xmath4 . in order to emphasize the fact that the volume element ( [ dv ] ) is metric independent we will call it a _ manifold volume element _ and the measure @xmath26 - a _ manifold volume measure_.    if @xmath27 one can think of four scalar fields @xmath23 as describing a homeomorphism of an open neighborhood of the point @xmath15 on the 4-dimensional euclidean space @xmath28 .",
    "however if one allows a dynamical mechanism of metrical dimensional reduction of the space - time by means of degeneracy of the metrical volume measure @xmath4 , there is no reason to ignore a possibility of a similar effect permitting degenerate manifold volume measure @xmath26 .",
    "the possibility of such ( or even stronger , with a sign change of @xmath26 ) dynamical effect seems to be here more natural since _ the manifold volume measure @xmath26 is sign indefinite _ ( in measure theory , sign indefinite measures are known as signed measures@xcite ) .",
    "note that the metrical and manifold volume measures are not obliged generically to be simultaneously nonzero .",
    "the original idea to use differential forms as describing dynamical degrees of freedom of the space - time differentiable manifold has been developed by taylor in his attempt@xcite to quantize the gravity .",
    "taylor argued that quantum mechanics is not compatible with a riemannian metric space - time ; moreover , in the quantum regime space - time is not even an affine manifold . only in the classical limit",
    "the metric and connection emerge , that one allows then to construct a traditional space - time description .",
    "of course , the transition to the classical limit is described in ref.@xcite rather in the form of a general prescription .",
    "thereupon we would like to pay attention to the additional possibility which was ignored in ref.@xcite .",
    "namely , in the classical limit not only the metric and connection emerge but also some of the differential forms could keep ( or restore ) certain dynamical effect in the classical limit . in such a case , the traditional space - time description may occur to be incomplete . * our key idea",
    "* is that one of such lost differential forms , the 4-form ( [ dv ] ) survives in the classical limit as describing dynamical degrees of freedom of the volume measure of the space - time manifold , and hence can affect the gravity theory on the classical level too .    if we add four scalar fields @xmath23 as new variables to a set of usual variables ( like metric , connection and matter degrees of freedom ) which undergo variations in the action principle in the tmt dynamics , see the end of sec.ii . ]",
    "then one can expect an effect of gravity and matter on the manifold volume measure @xmath26 and vice versa .",
    "we will see later in this paper that in fact such effects exist and in particular classical cosmology solutions of a significant interest exist where @xmath26 vanishes and changes sign .",
    "as is well known , the 4-dimensional differentiable manifold is orientable if it possesses a differential form of degree 4 which is nonzero at every point on the manifold .",
    "therefore two possible signs of the manifold volume measure ( [ phi ] ) are associated with two possible orientations of the space - time manifold .",
    "the latter means that besides a dimensional reduction and topology changes on the level of the differentiable manifold , the incorporation of the manifold volume measure @xmath26 allows to realize solutions describing _ dynamical change of the orientation of the space - time manifold_.    in the light of existence of two volume measures , the simplest way to take into account this fact in the action principle consists in the modification of the action which should now consist of two terms , one with the usual measure @xmath4 and another - with the measure @xmath26 , @xmath29 where two lagrangians @xmath30 and @xmath31 coupled with manifold and metrical volume measures appear respectively .",
    "according to our previous experience@xcite-@xcite in two measures field theory ( tmt ) we will proceed with an additional basic assumption that , at least on the classical level , the lagrangians @xmath30 and @xmath31 are independent of the scalar fields @xmath23 , i.e. the manifold volume measure degrees of freedom enter into tmt only through the manifold volume measure @xmath26 .",
    "in such a case , the action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) possesses an infinite dimensional symmetry @xmath32 where @xmath33 are arbitrary functions of @xmath34 ( see details in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one can hope that this symmetry should prevent emergence of the scalar fields @xmath23 dependence in @xmath34 and @xmath35 after quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "note that eq.([sec-2-s - modif ] ) is just a convenient way for presentation of the theory in a general form . in concrete models studied in the present paper",
    ", we will see that the action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) can be always rewritten in an equivalent form where _ each term in the action has its own total volume measure and the latter is a linear combination of @xmath26 and @xmath4_.    in the next section it will be shown that the space - time geometry described in terms of the original metric and connection of the underlying action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) is not generically riemannian .",
    "however by making use a change of variables to the einstein frame one can represent the resulting equations of motion in the riemannian ( or einstein - cartan ) space - time .    in our previous investigations",
    "we have shown that tmt enables radically new approaches to resolution of the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ( for an alternative approach see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "intrinsic features of tmt allow to realize a scalar field dark energy model where all dependence of the scalar field appears as a result of spontaneous breakdown of the dilatation symmetry .",
    "solutions of this model formulated in the einstein frame satisfy all existing tests of general relativity ( gr)@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a new sort of dynamical protection from the initial singularity of the curvature becomes possible@xcite .",
    "it also allows us to realize a phantom dark energy in the late time universe without explicit introducing phantom scalar field@xcite .",
    "in contrast to all our previous investigations of tmt , _ the purpose of the present paper _ is to study the dynamics of the metric @xmath6 and the manifold volume measure @xmath26 ( used in the underlying action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) ) in a number of tmt models .",
    "the main attention is concentrated on the analysis of the amazing features of `` irregularity '' of @xmath6 and @xmath26 ( involving change of orientation of the space - time manifold ) in the course of transitions to a ground state and in the phantom dark energy .",
    "it is very important to note immediately that in the einstein frame the metric tensor has regularity properties exactly as in gr .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following .",
    "in sec . ii we discuss general features of classical dynamics in tmt . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the pure gravity model . in secs .",
    "iv and v , in the framework of a simple scalar field model i , we analyze in detail the behavior of two volume measures in the course of transition to the ground state with zero cc . in sec .",
    "vi we study a ( generically broken ) intrinsic tmt symmetry which is restored in the ground states ; the relation of this symmetry restoration to the old cc problem@xcite is also analyzed ; a discussion of this effect is continued in sec.viii .",
    "in sec.vii we shortly present the scalar field model ii with spontaneously broken global scale invariance@xcite studied in detail in ref.@xcite . in the framework of such class of models , an interesting dynamics of the metric and the manifold volume measure in the course of transition to ground states",
    "is analyzed in sec.viii . in section",
    "ix we reveal that a possibility to realize a phantom dark energy without explicit introducing a phantom scalar field ( demonstrated in @xcite ) has the origin in a sign indefiniteness of the manifold volume measure ( [ phi ] ) . finally , since one can not check directly whether a tiny / zero cosmological constant is fine - tuned or not , in sec.x we discuss the new physical effects which arise from this theory and in particular a strong gravity effect in high energy physics experiments .",
    "varying the measure fields @xmath36 , we get @xmath37 where @xmath38 . since @xmath39 it follows that if @xmath40 the constraint @xmath41 must be satisfied , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a constant of integration with the dimension of mass",
    ". variation of the metric @xmath44 gives @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scalar field build of the scalar densities @xmath26 and @xmath4 .",
    "we study models with the lagrangians of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 stands for affine connection , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "dimensionless factor @xmath52 in front of @xmath53 in @xmath30 appears because there is no reason for couplings of the scalar curvature to the measures @xmath26 and @xmath4 to be equal .",
    "we choose @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the newton constant .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the matter lagrangians which can include all possible terms used in regular ( with only volume measure @xmath4 ) field theory models .",
    "since the measure @xmath26 is sign indefinite , the total volume measure @xmath59 in the gravitational term @xmath60 is generically also sign indefinite .",
    "variation of the connection yields the equations we have solved earlier@xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the christoffel s connection coefficients of the metric @xmath6 and @xmath63    if @xmath64 the covariant derivative of @xmath6 with this connection is nonzero ( nonmetricity ) and consequently geometry of the space - time with the metric @xmath6 is generically non - riemannian .",
    "the gravity and matter field equations obtained by means of the first order formalism contain both @xmath65 and its gradient as well .",
    "it turns out that at least at the classical level , the measure fields @xmath66 affect the theory only through the scalar field @xmath65 .    for the class of models ( [ l1l2 ] ) , the consistency of the constraint ( [ varphi ] ) and the gravitational equations ( [ g - mu - nu - varying ] ) has the form of the following constraint @xmath67 which determines @xmath68 ( up to the chosen value of the integration constant @xmath69 ) as a local function of matter fields and metric .",
    "note that the geometrical object @xmath68 does not have its own dynamical equation of motion and its space - time behavior is totally determined by the metric and matter fields dynamics via the constraint ( [ constr - original ] ) .",
    "together with this , since @xmath65 enters into all equations of motion , it generically has straightforward effects on dynamics of the matter and gravity through the forms of potentials , variable fermion masses and selfinteractions@xcite-@xcite .    for understanding the structure of tmt it is important to note that tmt ( where , as we suppose , the scalar fields @xmath66 enter only via the measure @xmath26 ) is a constrained dynamical system .",
    "in fact , the volume measure @xmath26 depends only upon the first derivatives of fields @xmath66 and this dependence is linear .",
    "the fields @xmath66 do not have their own dynamical equations : they are auxiliary fields .",
    "all their dynamical effect is displayed only in the following two ways : a ) in generating the constraint ( [ varphi ] ) ( or ( [ constr - original ] ) ) ; b ) in the appearance of the scalar field @xmath65 and its gradient in all equations of motion .",
    "let us start from the simplest tmt model with action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) where @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 are constants . note that @xmath73 can not have a physical contribution to the field equations ( in this model - only gravitational ) because @xmath74 is a total derivative .",
    "nevertheless we keep @xmath71 to see explicitly how @xmath71 appears in the result .",
    "@xmath75 would have a sense of the cosmological constant in the regular , non tmt , theory ( i.e. with the only measure @xmath4 ) .",
    "following the procedure described in sec.ii we obtain the gravitational equations ( [ g - mu - nu - varying ] ) and the constraint ( [ constr - original ] ) in the following form : @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath69 is the constant of integration that appears in eq.([varphi ] ) and we have assumed that the total volume measure in the gravitational term of the action is nonzero , that is @xmath78 .    since @xmath79 the connection @xmath80 , eq.([gam2 ] ) , coincides with the christoffel s connection coefficients of the metric @xmath6 .",
    "therefore in the model under consideration , the space - time with the metric @xmath6 is ( pseudo ) riemannian .",
    "it follows from eqs.([grav.eq.pure ] ) and ( [ constr.pure ] ) the resulting einstein equations @xmath81    constancy of @xmath68 on the mass shell , eq.([constr.pure ] ) , means that for the described solution the manifold and metrical volume measures coincide up to a normalization factor .",
    "however , this is true only on the mass shell ; if we were try to start from this assumption in the underlying action the resulting solution would be different completely .",
    "the model possesses a few interesting features in what it concerns the cc :    \\(1 ) the effective cc @xmath82 appears as a constant of integration ( as we noticed above , the parameter @xmath71 has no a physical meaning and it can be absorbed by the constant of integration ) .",
    "the effective regular , non tmt , gravity theory provides the same equations if the cosmological constant is added explicitly .",
    "\\(2 ) the effective cosmological constant @xmath82 does not depend at all on the cc - like parameter @xmath72 ( which should describe a total vacuum energy density including vacuum fluctuations of all matter fields ) .",
    "the latter resembles the situation in the unimodular theory@xcite,@xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) note that @xmath82 becomes very small if the integration constant is chosen such that @xmath83 is very small .",
    "the latter is equivalent to a solution with @xmath84 . in the limit where the metrical volume measure @xmath85 while the manifold volume measure @xmath26 remains nonzero , we get @xmath86 .",
    "thus a @xmath5 state is realized for a solution which involves a reduction of the metrical dimension to @xmath87 and at the same time the dimension of the space - time as a differentiable manifold remains @xmath88 .",
    "\\(4 ) in the limit where the free parameter @xmath89 , the gravitational term in the underlying action ( eqs.([sec-2-s - modif ] ) and ( [ l1l2pure ] ) ) with coupling to the manifold measure @xmath26 approaches zero ; then tmt takes the form of a regular ( non tmt ) field theory , but the effective cosmological constant @xmath82 becomes infinite . if we wish to reach a very small value of @xmath82 keeping the integration constant arbitrary , one should take the opposite limit where @xmath90 . then in the underlying action , the weight of the gravitational term with coupling to the manifold volume measure @xmath26 increases with respect to the regular one with coupling to the metrical measure @xmath4 .",
    "the above speculations can be regarded as a strong indication that tmt possesses a potential for resolution of the cc problem . in the next sections we will study this issue in more realistic models .",
    "let us now study a model including gravity as in eqs.([l1l2 ] ) and a scalar field @xmath91 .",
    "the action has the same structure as in eq.([sec-2-s - modif ] ) but it is more convenient to write down it in the following form @xmath92 \\label{s - model - scalar.f.}\\ ] ] the appearance of the dimensionless factor @xmath93 is explained by the fact that without fine tuning it is impossible in general to provide the same coupling of the @xmath91 kinetic term to the measures @xmath26 and @xmath4 .",

    "therefore the space - time with the metric @xmath6 is non - riemannian . to see the physical meaning of the model we perform a transition to a new metric @xmath98 where the connection @xmath80 becomes equal to the christoffel connection coefficients of the metric @xmath99 and the space - time turns into ( pseudo ) riemannian",
    "this is why the set of dynamical variables using the metric @xmath99 we call the einstein frame .",

    "it is interesting to see the role of the manifold volume measure in the resolution of the cc problem .",
    "we accomplish this now in the framework of the scalar field model i of previous section .",
    "the @xmath65-dependence of @xmath111 , eq.([veff1 ] ) , in the form of inverse square like @xmath112 has a key role in the resolution of the old cc problem in tmt .",
    "one can show that if quantum corrections to the underlying action generate nonminimal coupling like @xmath113 in both @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the general form of the @xmath65-dependence of @xmath114 remains similar : @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is a function .",
    "the fact that only such type of @xmath65-dependence emerges in @xmath111 , and a @xmath65-dependence is absent for example in the numerator of @xmath111 , is a direct result of our basic assumption that @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the action ( [ sec-2-s - modif ] ) are independent of the manifold measure fields @xmath66 .",

    "in such a case solving the constraint ( [ constraint2 - 1 ] ) for @xmath65 and substituting into eqs.([tmn-2])-([phief ] ) we obtain equations for scalar - gravity system which can be described by the regular gr effective action with the scalar field potential @xmath120 } \\label{veff3}\\ ] ] for an arbitrary nonconstant function @xmath94 there exist infinitely many values of the integration constant @xmath69 such that @xmath121 has the _ absolute minimum _ at some @xmath122 with @xmath123 ( provided @xmath124-v_2(\\phi)>0 $ ] ) .",
    "this effect takes place as @xmath125 * without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions*. note that the choice of the scalar field potential in the gr effective action in a form proportional to a perfect square like emerging in eq.([veff3 ] ) would mean a fine tuning .    for illustrative purpose",

    "also there is no problem with singularity of @xmath44 in the underlying action since @xmath149 the metric in the einstein frame @xmath99 is always regular because degeneracy of @xmath6 is compensated in eq.([gmunuein ] ) by singularity of the ratio of two measures @xmath150 .",

    "an example of such type of effects we have seen in sec.ix : the total volume measure of the dilaton scalar field kinetic term in the underlying action can change sign from positive to negative in the course of dynamical evolution of the late time universe . in the einstein frame , this transition corresponds to _ the crossing of the phantom divide of the dark energy_.    we have found out that in all studied models , the transition to the ground state is _ always accompanied by a certain degeneracy _ either in the metric ( e.g. , in @xmath8 or in all components ) or in the manifold volume measure @xmath26 , or even in both of them .",
    "this result differs sharply from what was expected e.g. in refs.@xcite-@xcite where degenerate metric solutions have been associated with high curvature and temperature phases .",
    "one should only take into account that degeneracy of @xmath6 and/or @xmath26 in the ( transition to ) ground state takes place only when one works with the set of variables of the underlying tmt action . in the einstein frame",
    ", we deal with the effective picture where the measure @xmath26 does not present at all and the metric tensor @xmath99 ( see eqs.([gmunuein ] ) or ( [ ct ] ) ) has the same regularity properties as in gr .",
    "the regularity of @xmath99 results from the singularity of the transformations ( [ gmunuein ] ) or ( [ ct ] ) ) : degeneracy of @xmath6 in a discrete set of moments is compensated by a singularity of @xmath65 .      tmt provides two different possibilities for resolution of the cc problem : one which guarantees zero cc without fine tuning ( see however the end of sec.vi and appendix b ) ; another which allows an unexpected way to reach a tiny cc . which of these possibilities is realized depends on the sign of the integration constant @xmath69 , @xmath42 .",
    "we are going now to discuss these two issues .",
    "this case is of a special interest for two reasons .",
    "first , as it was shown earlier@xcite , the conditions of the weinberg s no - go theorem@xcite fail and a transition to a zero cc state in tmt can be realized without fine tuning .",
    "this becomes possible for example if @xmath328 and the integration constant @xmath329 .",
    "second , as we have shown in sec.v , in the course of transition to a zero cc state , @xmath6 and @xmath26 oscillate synchronously around zero and they cross zero each time @xmath330 ( @xmath331 ) when the scalar field @xmath91 crosses the ( zero ) absolute minimum of the potential ( [ veff3 ] ) ( or of the potential ( [ eff - l - ala - mukhanov - potential ] ) for the model of sec.vii with @xmath332 , see @xcite ) .",
    "one should recall that @xmath68 does not have its own dynamics : its values at the space - time point @xmath15 are determined directly and immediately by the local configuration of the matter fields and gravity through the algebraic constraint , which is nothing but a consistency condition of equations of motion .",
    "@xmath68 does not possess inertia and therefore it changes together and synchronously with changing matter and gravity fields .",
    "this notion is very important when trying to answer the natural question : can oscillations of @xmath68 be a source for particle creation ?",
    "the answer is - no , it can not .",
    "in fact , there is a coupling of @xmath65 with fermions .",
    "but the structure of this coupling in the einstein frame has very surprising features which we will shortly review in the next subsection .",
    "here we are only formulating the conclusion : emergence of even a tiny amount of fermionic matter immediately yields a rearrangement of the vacuum in such a way that @xmath65 instantly ceases the regime of oscillations and rapidly enters into a regime of monotonous approach to a nonzero constant .",
    "it is interesting to note that the latter effect may explain why the present day cosmological constant most likely is tiny but nonzero , in spite of the existence of a fine tuning free classical solution described a transition to the @xmath5 state .",
    "an overall change of sign of @xmath6 in the course of these oscillations means a change of the signature from @xmath333 to @xmath334 and vice versa , while oscillations of the sign of @xmath26 describe the change of orientation of the space - time manifold .",
    "the latter means that the arena of the gravitational dynamics should contain two space - time manifolds with opposite orientations .",
    "the discrete set of changes of the orientations happens in the form of a _ smooth _ dynamical process in the course of which the space - time passes _ the `` degenerate '' phase where both the metrical structure and the total 4d - volume measure disappear_. the latter means also that the term `` orientation of the space - time manifold '' loses any sense at moments @xmath330 ( @xmath331 ) .",
    "we conclude therefore that two 4d differentiable manifolds with opposite orientations ( described by means of a sign indefinite volume 4-form ) equipped with connection and metrical structure still are not enough to describe the arena of the gravitational dynamics : the complete description of the space - time dynamics requires also the mentioned degenerate phase .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar to that discussed in introduction : first - order formulation of gr where the degenerate phase with @xmath335 should be also added@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; see e.g. the recent discussion by baados@xcite where the limiting process @xmath336 is analyzed .    a new interesting feature of ground states in tmt we have revealed in the present paper concerns the so - called global einstein symmetry ( ges ) , eqs.([les1])-([linear - trans ] ) , which turns out generically to be explicitly broken in all models with non - trivial dynamics .",
    "the surprising result we have discovered here on the basis of a number of models is that _ the ges is restored in the course of transitions to the ground state _ in all models considered .",
    "hence its subgroup of the sign inversions of @xmath6 and @xmath26 , eq.([reflection ] ) , is also restored .",
    "therefore the oscillations of @xmath6 and @xmath26 around zero in the course of transition to a @xmath5 ground state provoke a wish to compare this _ dynamical effect _ with the attempts to solve the old cc problem developed in refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main idea of these approaches is that the field theory or at least the ground state@xcite should be invariant under transformations of a discrete symmetry . according to refs.@xcite-@xcite",
    "it might be either an invariance under the metric reversal symmetry or under the space - time coordinate transformations with the imaginary unit @xmath337 : @xmath338 .",
    "in contrast with these approaches , in tmt there is no need to postulate such exotic enough symmetries .",
    "nevertheless we have seen that sign inversions of @xmath6 emerge as a dynamical effect in the course of the cosmological evolution and this effect has indeed a relation to the resolution of the old cc problem .      in the scalar field models of dark energy , an interesting feature of tmt",
    "consists in a possibility to provide a small value of the cc .",
    "if in the model of sec.viii.b , the parameter @xmath339 and @xmath340 then the cc can be very small without the need for @xmath127 and @xmath196 to be very small . for example , if @xmath341 is determined by the energy scale of electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath342 and @xmath343 is determined by the planck scale @xmath344 then @xmath345 .",
    "along with such a seesaw mechanism@xcite , @xcite , there exists another way to explain the smallness of the cc applicable in all types of scenarios discussed in secs.viii.b-viii.d ( see also appendix a ) . as one can see from eqs.([lambda ] ) , ( [ a - phi - exact - bv1equal2v2 ] ) and ( [ minveff ] ) , the value of @xmath82 appears to be inverse proportional is proportional to @xmath195 ] to the dimensionless parameter @xmath195 which characterizes the relative strength of the manifold and metrical parts of the gravitational action . if for example @xmath347 then for getting @xmath348 one should assume that @xmath349 .",
    "such a large value of @xmath223 ( see eq.([l1l2 ] ) ) permits to formulate _ a correspondence principle_@xcite _ between tmt and regular ( i.e. one - measure ) field theories _",
    ": when @xmath350 then one can neglect the gravitational term in @xmath30 with respect to that in @xmath31 ( see eq.([l1l2 ] ) or eq.([s - model - scalar.f . ] ) or eq.([totaction ] ) ) .",
    "more detailed analysis shows that in such a case the manifold volume measure @xmath351 has no a dynamical effect and tmt is reduced to gr .",
    "this happens e.g. in the model of sec.viii.c where the late time evolution proceeds in a quintessence - like manner : the energy density decreases to the cosmological constant , eq.([lambda - bv1equal2v2 ] ) , and @xmath352 , eq.([zeta - asympt - delta=0 - 1 ] ) .",
    "another example is the model of sec.viii.d where @xmath353 in the ground state , eq.([zeta - in - minveff ] ) , while @xmath4 is finite .",
    "however generically @xmath354 is not small , as it happens for example in the quintessence - like scenario of the late time universe in the model of sec.viii.b ( see eq.([zeta - asympt - delta=0 ] ) )",
    ".        it would be interesting to find out other possible physical manifestations of the sign indefiniteness of the manifold volume measure .",

    "note that the fermion equation in the einstein frame has a canonical form but the mass of the fermion turns out @xmath65 dependent @xmath363    the constraint ( [ constraint3 ] ) describes the local balance between the fermion energy density and the scalar field @xmath91 contribution to the dark energy density in the space - time region where the wave function of the primordial fermion is not equal to zero . by means of this balance",
    "the constraint determines the scalar @xmath68 .    in the case of dust as a phenomenological matter model , the r.h.s . of the constraint ( [ constraint3 ] )",

    "the wonderful feature of these models in the einstein frame consists of the exact coincidence of the following three quantities : a ) the noncanonical ( in comparison with gr ) terms in the energy - momentum tensor ; b ) the effective coupling `` constant '' of the dilaton @xmath91 to the matter ( up to the factor @xmath369 ) ; c ) the expressions in the r.h.s . of the above mentioned constraints ( [ constraint3 ] ) and ( [ rhs - dust ] ) for fermionic matter and dust",

    "then the mentioned three quantities simultaneously become extremely small . besides for the matter in normal conditions",
    "the gravitational equations are reduced to the canonical gr equations .",
    "the practical disappearance of the dilaton - to - matter coupling `` constant '' for the matter in normal conditions which occurs without fine tuning of the parameters allows us to assert that in such type of models the fifth force problem is resolved@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it does not mean however that matter does not interact with the dilaton at all .",
    "when the matter is in states different from normal , the effect of dilaton - to - matter coupling may yield new very interesting phenomena .",
    "one of such effects appears when the neutrino energy density decreases to the order of magnitude close to the vacuum energy density .",
    "the latter can happen due to spreading of the neutrino wave packet .",
    "then the cold gas of uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos causes a reconstruction of the vacuum to a state with @xmath373 and as a result the neutrino gas rapidly transmute into an exotic state called neutrino dark energy(see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",

    "there exists however another solution if one allows a possibility that in the core of the support of the fermion wave function the local dark energy density may be much bigger than the vacuum energy density .",

    "recall that for simplicity we have chosen here @xmath357 .",
    "but if one do not to imply this fine tuning then one can immediately see from eqs.([gef1])-([veff2 ] ) that in the einstein frame the regime of the strong gravity dictated by the dense fermion matter is manifested for the dilaton too .",
    "the coupling constant in eq.([selfinter ] ) is dimensionless and depends exponentially of the dilaton @xmath91 if one can regard @xmath91 as a background field @xmath380 .",
    "but in a more general case eq.([selfinter ] ) may be treated as describing an anomalous dilaton - to - fermion interaction very much different from the discussed above case of interaction of the dilaton to the fermion matter in normal conditions where the coupling constant practically vanishes .",
    "such an anomalous dilaton - to - fermion interaction should result in creation of quanta of the dilaton field in processes with very heavy fermions .",
    "the probability of these processes is of course proportional to the newton constant @xmath381 .",
    "but the new effect consists of the fact that the effective coupling constant of the anomalous dilaton - to - fermion interaction is proportional to @xmath382 .",
    "if the dilaton is the scalar field responsible for the quintessential inflation type of the cosmological scenario@xcite then one should expect an exponential amplification of the effective coupling of this interaction in the present day universe in comparison with the early universe .",
    "one can hope that the described effect of the strong gravity might be revealed in the lhc experiments in the form of missing energy due to the multiple production of quanta of the dilaton field ( recall that coupling of the dilaton to fermions in normal conditions practically vanishes and therefore the dilaton will not be observed after being emitted ) .",
    "_ dark matter as effect of gravitational enhancement .",
    "_ in the case of dust as a phenomenological matter model , the constraint ( [ constraint3 ] ) with the r.h.s .",
    "( [ rhs - dust ] ) is the fifth degree algebraic equation with respect to @xmath383 .",
    "there are some indications that in a certain region of the parameters a solution of the constraint exists which could provide a very interesting effect of an amplification of the gravitational field of visible diluted galactic and intergalactic dust or / and neutrinos .",
    "such an effect might imply that the dark matter is not a new sort of matter but it is just a result of a so far unknown enhancement of the gravitational field of low density states of usual matter .",

    "a natural mechanism was suggested by de angelis , mansutti and roncadelli@xcite in order to resolve this puzzle .",
    "the idea is to suppose that there exists a very light spin - zero boson coupled to the photon : @xmath384 where @xmath385 is a mass parameter . in the context of quintessential scenario such",
    "a coupling was studied by carroll@xcite .",
    "then @xmath386 oscillations emerge which explain@xcite the observed transparency of the universe to gamma rays in a natural way if mass of the spin - zero boson @xmath387 .",
    "the crucial feature of this boson is that no other coupling of this scalar to matter exists . in the standard quintessence models this feature seems to be a real problem .",
    "but in tmt , as we already mentioned ( see also refs.@xcite,@xcite ) the dilaton playing the role of quintessence field decouples from matter in normal conditions .",

    "_ a theoretical attempt by farhi , guth and guven to describe a creation of a universe in the laboratory@xcite runs across a need to allow vanishing and changing sign of @xmath4 . in ref.@xcite , this need is naturally regarded as a pathology . if similar approach to the problem of creation of a universe in the laboratory could be formulated in the framework of tmt then instead of @xmath4 there should appear a linear combination of @xmath26 and @xmath4 which , as we already know , is able to vanish and change sign . in recent",
    "paper@xcite by guendelman and sakai a model of child universe production without initial singularities was studied . to provide the desirable absence of initial singularity",
    "a crucial point is that the energy momentum tensor of the domain wall should be dominated by a sort of phantom energy .",
    "a possible way to realize this idea is to apply the dynamical brane tension@xcite obtained when using the modified volume measure similar to the signed measure @xmath26 of the present paper .",

    "note finally that for the matter in normal conditions the model does not impose essential constraints on the parameters of the model ( such as @xmath195 , @xmath93 , @xmath365 , @xmath118 , @xmath360 ) .",
    "but the appropriate constraints should appear when more progress in the study of the listed and another possible new effects will be achieved .",

    "we also thank m. duff for explaining us his approach and m. baados for useful conversations .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee whose constructive remarks assisted us in the improvement of this paper .",
    "let us consider the scalar field model i ( eqs.([s - model - scalar.f . ] ) and ( [ v12model ] ) ) with @xmath136 where we now choose a positive integration constant ( @xmath198 ) and the parameters @xmath389 , @xmath390 .",
