    "the global pattern of the solution remains qualitatively similar , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - m : mp0 - 1200 ] . only @xmath148 and @xmath152 move to higher temperatures . inspecting the low - temperature region in more detail , cf",
    "[ fig - zm : mp0 - 1200 ] , we see that a new metastable solution , which ends already at rather low temperature , appears .",
    "this new solution has a nonzero field ( fig .",
    "[ fig - f : mp0 - 1200 ] ) but violates the ng theorem .",
    "in addition the metastable solution , which before started at @xmath125 , now begins at zero temperature , since at @xmath158 1.2 gev we have already @xmath159 , cf .",
    "( [ tc ] ) .",
    "if we take a low value for the scale @xmath3 , the structure of the stable solution becomes more involved , see figs .",
    "[ fig - m : mp0 - 300][fig - p : mp0 - 300 ] . in the broken - symmetry sector",
    "we still have a massless pion and a nonzero field , see fig .",
    "[ fig - f : mp0 - 300 ] .",
    "however , at higher temperatures the metastable branch , displayed by the dotted line , reveals back - bending .",
    "this back - bended part of the branch turns out to be the most stable one , see fig .",
    "[ fig - p : mp0 - 300 ] . as a result",
    "we arrive at a complicated structure for the stable solution , where even the pressure turns out to be discontinuous .",
    "a common feature for all scales is that the point of the first phase transition , @xmath149  mev , is approximately @xmath3-independent and has about the same value as that in the naive renormalization scheme @xcite . at the same time , the point of the second phase transition , @xmath148 , and the end point of the stable solution , @xmath152 , are essentially @xmath3-dependent .      in the case of explicitly broken symmetry ( @xmath140  mev ) , the structure of solutions at various @xmath3 scales is similar to that described above for the chiral limit .",
    "even the behavior of metastable branches remains similar .",
    "we illustrate the changes on the example of @xmath146  mev , see figs .",
    "[ fig - zm : mp139 - 600][fig - f : mp139 - 600 ] which looks the most physically appealing and is close to results of the naive renormalization @xcite .",
    "the main difference from the @xmath139 case is that the sequence of two phase transitions is transformed here into a smooth cross - over transition .",
    "we have studied a renormalized version of the gapless @xmath0-derivable hf approximation to the @xmath2 theory with spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry , proposed in ref .",
    "this ghf approximation simultaneously preserves all the desirable features of @xmath0-derivable approximation schemes ( i.e. , the validity of conservation laws and thermodynamic consistency ) and respects the ng theorem in the phase of spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "this is achieved by adding a correction @xmath37 to the conventional @xmath0 functional .",
    "the nature of this correction can be understood as follows .",
    "the conventional @xmath0-derivable hf approximation cuts off an infinite series of diagrams , among which are those providing the ng theorem in the phase of spontaneously broken symmetry . by introducing the @xmath37 correction to the hf approximation",
    "we take into account a part of those omitted diagrams ( at the level of the actual approximation ) , which restores the ng theorem .",
    "an advantage of the ghf approximation is that it allows for scale - independent renormalization in the vacuum , unlike the conventional hf approximation  @xcite .",
    "the scale independence in the vacuum is a direct consequence of the ng theorem , which makes the equations for the pion self - energy and classical field degenerated .",
    "however , even in the ghf approximation , only renormalization scales higher than a certain value ( @xmath110 , cf . eq .",
    "( [ mu-0 ] ) ) are allowed , in order to ensure stability of the renormalized approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the scale dependence still persists at finite temperatures .",
    "the violation of renormalization - scale independence of @xmath0-derivable approximations was shown in  @xcite from the point of view of the renormalization - group @xmath160 function . there",
    "the @xmath160 function , evaluated from the @xmath0-functional formalism , was shown to deviate from its perturbative expansion , beginning at orders in the expansion parameter , higher than that explicitly taken in the @xmath0 functional .",
    "the reason is the violation of `` crossing symmetry '' in the sense of  @xcite : solving the self - consistent equations of motion corresponds to a partial resummation of diagrams to any order in the expansion parameter ( e.g. , the coupling constant @xmath102 or @xmath161 , i.e. , the order of loops in perturbative feynman diagrams ) which is necessarily incomplete for any truncation of the @xmath0 functional .    within our renormalization scheme ,",
    "it becomes clear that the renormalization - scale dependence at finite temperatures originates from the subtraction of the `` hidden subdivergence '' of the four - point function inside the self - consistent tadpole loop .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , this four - point function consists of a resummation in only one channel , and thus the @xmath160 function of this resummed four - point function deviates from the correct one at orders higher than contained in the approximation of the @xmath0-functional , i.e. , to @xmath162 .    at large scales ( @xmath163 )",
    "the chiral phase transition proceeds similar to that in the naive renormalization scheme @xcite . in the case of the exact @xmath1 symmetry",
    ", it proceeds through a sequence of two second - order phase transitions rather than a single one . in the first transition the mean field vanishes but the meson masses still remain different .",
    "the temperature of this phase transition , @xmath149  mev , is approximately @xmath3-independent and has approximately the same value as that in the naive renormalization scheme @xcite . in the second transition",
    "also the masses become equal , and the @xmath1 symmetry is completely restored . the corresponding temperature , @xmath148 ,",
    "turns out to be essentially @xmath3-dependent .",
    "when the @xmath1 symmetry is explicitly violated , the sequence of two phase transitions is transformed into a smooth cross - over transition .",
    "moreover , at @xmath164 the results are even qualitatively close to those obtained with the naive renormalization @xcite . at small scales ( say @xmath165 ) , the phase structure becomes very complicated , however still respecting the ng theorem in the phase of spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "another result concerns both the conventional renormalized hf and ghf approximations , which in fact are identical in the phase of restored @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "there exists an end point of the solution , i.e. , a temperature @xmath152 above which there are no solutions to the gap equations .",
    "the occurrence of such an end point in the hf approximation was first pointed out by baym and grinstein  @xcite and is caused by the dominant role of @xmath166 terms in the gap equations , which originate from the renormalization procedure .",
    "the dominant behavior of the @xmath167 terms signals a breakdown of the hf approximation and the need to include higher - order corrections into the @xmath0 functional  @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is whether one can find a renormalization - group improved @xmath0-derivable approximation to cure this problem .",
    "we have found that at low scales ( like @xmath165 ) , the end point appears at rather low temperatures , leaving almost no room for the hf ( as well as ghf ) approximation in the phase of restored @xmath1 symmetry . at the same time , at ( @xmath168 ) , the end point moves to rather high energies @xmath169  gev , hence allowing this approximation at least at @xmath170  gev .    summarizing , we have found that the ghf approximation is certainly advantageous as compared to the conventional hf one , since it respects the ng theorem and allows scale - independent renormalization in the vacuum .",
    "these properties are closely interrelated .",
    "they both require that the set of equations of motion are degenerate in the phase of spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , there still are serious problems with the renormalization of @xmath0-derivable approximations for a theory with a spontaneously broken symmetry . at finite temperatures the predictions of renormalized ghf approximations essentially depend on the renormalization scale , contrary to the case of the renormalized perturbation theory . in this respect ,",
    "the ghf approximation becomes similar to the leading - order @xmath107-approximation , where also both the ng theorem and scale - independent renormalization in the vacuum hold true  @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the medium - independent renormalization performed in accordance with refs .",
    "@xcite , this scale - dependence at finite temperatures can not be already interpreted as an artifact of temperature - dependent counter terms .",
    "it may turn out that this scale dependence is a consequence of triviality of the @xmath2 theory  @xcite which , when it is renormalized , therefore requires an external scale to serve for a scale , below which it can be used as an effective field theory to describe the low - energy phenomenology .",
