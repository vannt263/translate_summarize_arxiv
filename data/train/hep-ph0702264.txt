    "the study of various flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes has been shown to be very useful .",
    "in particular , as the heaviest fermion in the standard model ( sm ) , the top quark may play a special role in fcnc phenomenology . in the sm the fcnc interactions of the top quark are extremely suppressed by the gim mechanism , so that no fcnc top quark rates can reach an observable level at current or future colliders @xcite .",
    "thus , the observation of any fcnc top quark process would be a robust evidence for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "due to its heaviness , the top quark is very sensitive to new physics . indeed",
    ", several models beyond the sm often predict much larger fcnc top quark interactions @xcite .",
    "such fcnc interactions can induce various top quark production and decay channels , which can be explored in future collider experiments @xcite and serve as a good probe for new physics .",
    "so far , much effort has been spent on the exploration of the fcnc top quark interactions . on the experimental side ,",
    "the tevatron cdf and d0 collaborations have reported interesting bounds on the fcnc top quark decays from run 1 experiment and will tighten the bounds from the ongoing run 2 experiments @xcite . on the theoretical side , various fcnc top quark decays and top - charm associated productions at high energy colliders were extensively studied in the sm @xcite , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite and other new physics models @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that the sm predictions for such processes are far below the detectable level .",
    "however , some new physics can enhance them by several orders of magnitude , which makes them potentially accessible at future colliders .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will be a powerful machine for studying the top quark properties such as its fcnc interactions since it will produce top quarks copiously .",
    "analysis @xcite showed that some fcnc top quark rare decays with branching ratios as low as @xmath2 could be accessible at the lhc . due to its high energy and high luminosity",
    ", the lhc will be the main utility for exploring fcnc top quark production channels @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a leading candidate for new physics beyond the sm and its consequences will be extensively explored at the lhc . in this paper , we throughly investigate various top quark fcnc processes in the framework of the mssm .",
    "a characteristic feature of the model is that , in addition to the fcnc interactions generated at loop level by the ckm mixing matrix in the sm , it predicts fcnc interactions from soft susy breaking terms @xcite .",
    "these additional fcnc interactions depend on the squark flavor mixings , and for the case of top quark , they are sensitive to the potentially large mixings between charm squarks ( scharms ) and top squarks ( stops ) .    in this paper , we will examine six production channels , which proceed through the parton - level : @xmath3 and five fcnc top quark decay modes : @xmath4    among these , the decays @xmath5 and the production @xmath6 have already been studied in the mssm before @xcite , while the others have not been studied so far .",
    "here we perform a comprehensive study of all these processes in the mssm for the following purposes :    * since in the mssm all these processes are induced mainly by scharm - stop mixings and each of them involves the same set of susy parameters , they are correlated .",
    "although some of them have been studied in the literature , they were treated individually in different papers .",
    "even though a combined analysis has been done in @xcite within the framework of effective lagrangian where the coefficients of all fcnc interactions are independent , such analysis is missing in an explicit model .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive and comparative study of all these processes in an explicit model is necessary . * through a comparative study of all these channels , we could determine the relative size of their rates .",
    "this is useful since the lhc experiments can in principle measure each of them and the pattern of relative rates can be tested . only by considering all these processes together ,",
    "we might know which one has the largest rate and will hopefully be discovered at the lhc , if the mssm is the correct framework . * by scrutinizing the dependence of the rates of these transitions on the relevant susy parameters , one can determine the most sensitive parameters of the model and then discuss how the future lhc measurements could possibly bound them . * performing the scan over the whole parameter space , subject to all the direct and indirect current experimental constraints on the scharm - stop flavor mixings @xcite , the maximal rate for each process can be determined and , in this way , we can pinpoint which ones are hopefully observable at the lhc .",
    "of course , this does not mean that one should give up searching for those low - rate processes at the lhc . as stated above , the lhc measurements can readily place bounds on the sensitive susy parameters and such bounds are complementary to the current experimental constraints , most of which are indirect constraints .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the possible sources of flavor violation in the mssm and give the fcnc interaction lagrangian relevant to our calculations . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce a method to calculate various top quark fcnc processes .",
    "this method , as will be shown , can greatly simplify our calculations .",
    "the predictions of the rates are given in sec .",
    "iv , with emphasis on illustrating the characteristics of their dependence on the relevant susy parameters . in sec .",
    "v we consider various experimental constraints on the sources of flavor violation and scan the parameter space to find the maximal rates at the lhc .",
    "we draw our conclusion in sec .",
    "finally , we give the expressions for the loop results in the appendix .",
    "there are two sources of flavor violation in the mssm @xcite .",
    "the first one arises from the flavor mixings of up - quarks and down - quarks , which are described by the ckm matrix ( inherited from the sm ) .",
    "the second one results from the misalignment between the rotations that diagonalize the quark and squark sectors due to the presence of soft susy breaking terms .",
    "this source can induce large top quark fcnc processes and is the focus of investigation in this paper .    in the super - ckm basis with states ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) for up - squarks and ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) for down - squarks , the @xmath19 squark mass matrix @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) takes the form @xcite @xmath22 where the soft mass parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath26 matrices in flavor space , @xmath27 stands for the unit matrix",
    ", @xmath28 is the diagonal quark mass matrix , @xmath29 for up - squarks and @xmath30 for down - squarks , and @xmath31 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields . in general , the soft mass parameters are flavor non - diagonal . since the low energy experimental data , such as @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 mixings , require the flavor mixings involving the first generation squarks to be negligibly small @xcite , we only consider the flavor mixings of the second and third generations and parametrize the soft mass parameters as @xmath35 for up - type squarks .",
    "similarly , for down - squarks we have @xmath36 due to @xmath37 gauge invariance , @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 note that the mixing parameters , @xmath40 in the down sector defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta-lr ] ) are independent of @xmath41 in the up sector defined in eq .",

    "( [ up squark ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ delta-lr ] ) , we only kept the terms of third - family squarks , since we adopted the popular assumption that they are proportional to the corresponding quark masses .",
    "it is clear that the mixing parameters in the squark mass matrices affect both the squark mass and its interactions .",
    "for example , in the presence of flavor mixings , squark - quark interactions are given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the interaction in squark mass - eigenstates , @xmath45 is that in the interaction basis , @xmath46 may be gluino , neutralino or chargino , and @xmath47 is the unitary matrix which diagonalizes the squark mass matrix . for the convenience in the following discussions ,",

    "although each of the above interactions contributes to the top quark fcnc transitions by gaugino mediated loops , the contributions could be of quite different magnitude .",
    "since both the neutralino and gluino contributions depend on the same parameters in the up - type squark mass matrix , their different coupling strength indicate that the neutralino contribution is much smaller than the gluino contribution , except for a very massive gluino and light neutralino scenario . noting that b - physics requires small @xmath62 @xcite , the fcnc interactions induced by charginos are in general not large .",
    "recently , these three types of contributions to @xmath63 at the lhc were simultaneously calculated in @xcite , and it was shown that both the neutralino and the chargino contribution are several orders of magnitude smaller than the gluino contribution for most susy parameter space . since we are mostly interested in the parameter regions with large predictions for fcnc processes , in this paper we consider only the gluino - mediated contributions .    even if only the gluino - mediated loops are considered in calculating the top quark fcnc interactions ,",
    "the model has still a large parameter set . beside the gluino mass , there are nine soft mass parameters in the scharm - stop mass matrix , which complicates our analysis . in order to simplify our calculations , we neglect the charm quark mass .",
    "then the amplitude squared for any top quark fcnc mode / channel considered in this paper can be decomposed as @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is the amplitude squared with a left - handed ( right - handed ) charm quark , as either an external state or internal state in feynman diagrams . furthermore , by using the mass insertion method@xcite , one can easily find that @xmath66 ( @xmath67 vanishes if there is no left - handed ( right - handed ) scharm mixings with stop , and that these amplitudes have a weaker dependence on right - handed ( left - handed ) scharm mixings than on the left - handed ( right - handed ) scharm mixings .",
    "these features , verified numerically by our calculations , motivate us to consider the case with only left - handed scharm mixings in top quark fcnc processes . in this case , the relevant soft mass parameters are reduced to seven , since we set @xmath68 and @xmath69 is irrelevant to our calculation ( see eq .",
    "( [ up squark ] ) ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we always consider this case , but we note that for those transitions not involving @xmath70 bosons , the results for @xmath71 can be applied to @xmath72 with the substitutions @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "another reason for considering only left - handed scharm mixings with stops is that these are well motivated in popular flavor - blind susy breaking scenarios , such as the msugra model @xcite and gauge - mediated susy - breaking models @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the sfermion - mass matrices are flavor diagonal at the susy - breaking scale , but the yukawa couplings can induce flavor mixings when evolving the matrices down to the electroweak scale .",
    "estimates of these radiatively induced off - diagonal squark - mass terms indicate the magnitude for left - handed flavor mixings are proportional to bottom quark mass , while those for the right - handed scharm are proportional to charm quark mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , in phenomenological studies of scharm - stop mixings , one usually assumes the existence of left - handed scharm mixings .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that although we make use of the parametrization in eqs.(12 - 14 ) , which is widely used in the literature for the calculations by mass insertion approximation , our calculations are the full computation in the mass eigentsate basis of squarks ( that is we first diagonalize the squark mass matrices and then perform the loop calculations in the mass eigentsate basis ) .",
    "such a treatment , unlike the mass insertion method @xcite which makes sense only for @xmath75 , can allow for @xmath76 ( as will be shown in sec .",
    "v , in some cases @xmath76 can be permitted by all experimental constraints because we use non - universal squark mass parameters , that is @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are not degenerate ) .",
    "note that although all our numerical results are obatined from such full computation in the mass eigenstate basis , we will utilize the mass insertion method when we try to qualitatively explain the behaviors of some results .",
    "we introduce a method which can greatly simplify our calculations since it avoids repetition of the evaluation of a same loop - corrected vertex in different places , or in different processes .",
    "all results in this paper were obtained by this method , and some of them were cross - checked by other tools such as formcalc @xcite .",
    "the key point of our method is the so - called  effective vertex \" . to illustrate this method we consider @xmath80 as an example .",
    "the feynman diagrams for this process are shown in fig .",
    "[ general ] .",
    "the susy - qcd contributions to the @xmath81 transition and the vertex @xmath82 , as well as the box diagrams , are given in fig .",

    "1(a ) can be split into two terms , one containing a charm quark propagator , and the other containing a top quark propagator @xmath83 we collect the first term together with fig .  1(e , f ) , and combine the second term together with fig .",
    "1(g , h ) . after this arrangement",
    ", we can define a momentum dependent effective @xmath84 interaction as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the penguin diagram contribution to the effective interaction and @xmath87 is the usual qcd vertex .",
    "then the calculation of fig .",
    "[ general](a - h ) is equivalent to the calculation of the  tree \" level transition depicted in fig .",
    "[ effective](a - c ) , which obviously has a simpler structure . by following this method ,",
    "our calculations can be greatly simplified , since the effective @xmath84 interaction appears in many processes , and the effective @xmath84 interaction is the same for all channels considered in the paper .    of course ,",
    "the effective vertex @xmath84 is model - dependent since its components @xmath88 and @xmath89 are model - dependent .",
    "we obtained their expressions in susy qcd analytically .",
    "we retain the tensor loop functions rather than expanding them in terms of scalar loop functions as usual @xcite .",
    "this method makes our results quite compact and also simplifies our fortran codes which will be discussed below .",
    "the effective vertex @xmath90 in eq .  ( [ eff ] ) is a 4-component lorentz vector and also a @xmath91 matrix in dirac spinor space . in its realization in fortran coding",

    "we also use arrays to encode other quantities such as lorentz vectors , dirac spinors , lorentz tensors and dirac @xmath95 matrices .",
    "the steps to calculate the effective interaction in fortran code can be then summarized as follows :    * input the matrices @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for any other matrices encountered in the calculation",
    ", we use @xmath95 algebra to generate its elements .",
    "* use the mass splitting method@xcite to generate events with momentums for the initial and final particles . * for a generated event with fixed momenta , the components of any tensor loop function can be calculated numerically and stored in arrays . *",
    "generate the @xmath99 matrices @xmath100 and contract its lorentz indices with those of tensor loop functions and those of quark momenta to obtain the effective vertex .    to calculate the amplitude of @xmath101 , we also need to calculate box diagrams .",
    "such calculations are usually tedious if the four - point tensor loop functions are expanded in terms of scalar loop functions .",
    "since we choose to retain the tensor loop functions and contract the indices numerically , our results are quite compact , as shown for @xmath6 in the appendix .",
    "the general expression for a box diagram is the sum of fermion chain of the form @xmath102 and its numerical value is calculated by the following steps    * input the wave functions for fermions and define the multiplication of @xmath95 matrix with the wave function . *",
    "generate the tensor , say @xmath103 , and contract its indices with those of loop functions @xmath104 and those of vectors involved , to get the value of each term in the amplitude .    with the method introduced above",
    ", we can also easily calculate other fcnc interactions .",

    "these interactions are needed to obtain the effective top fcnc interactions .",
    "we know , from the discussion in section ii , that the calculations of the susy - qcd contributions induced by the flavor mixings between left - handed scharm and stop , depend on the parameters @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in this section",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the numerical results on these parameters .",
    "we first show the results for top quark rare decays .",
    "these decay modes occur only via one effective interaction and thus their dependence on the parameters is relatively simple .",
    "we perform a comparative study and plot the results for these decays together , to illustrate their dependence on a given set of parameters . after analyzing the features of the top quark",
    "rare decays , we extend the study to the fcnc top quark productions .",

    "12 ) , we adopt the so - called @xmath122 scenario @xcite which is widely discussed in higgs physics , and which assumes that all the soft mass parameters are degenerate @xmath123 and that all the trilinear couplings are also degenerate , @xmath124 , with @xmath125 . in investigating the processes",

    "for example , for the three body decay @xmath134 we require that the energy of each decay product be larger than @xmath135 gev and the separation of any two final states be more than @xmath136 in the top quark rest frame . for the top quark production channels , we require that the transverse momentum of each produced particle be larger than @xmath135 gev and their pseudo rapidity be less than 2.5 in the laboratory frame .",
    "moreover , for @xmath137 followed by @xmath138 , we do not require the top quark exactly on mass shell and instead we require the invariant mass of bottom quark and w boson in a region of @xmath139 ( @xmath140 is the top quark width ) .",
    "this requirement was once used in @xcite to investigate the observability of this channel at hadron colliders in the effective lagrangian framework .",

    "these figures show some common features of all the gauge boson decay modes .",

    "the second is that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ decay5 ] , the branching ratios increase with the increase of @xmath150 .",
    "this is because @xmath150 affects the squark mass splittings and could alleviate the cancellation between different loop contributions .",
    "the third feature is that the branching ratios increase rapidly with the flavor mixing @xmath118 and @xmath119 , because the flavor mixings can not only enhance the coupling strength of squark flavor changing interactions , but also enlarge the squark mass splittings .",

    "these last two effects combined make the branching ratios very sensitive to the flavor mixing parameters .    by comparing the case @xmath151 with the case @xmath152 throughout figs .",

    "for the effective @xmath177 interaction , with both the top and the charm quarks on - shell , the general expression is @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a form factor emanating from the loop calculation .",
    "this interaction , like the effective @xmath90 interaction , also involves both flavor change and chirality flip .",
    "so in some aspects , the behavior for @xmath176 should be similar to @xmath180 .",
    "but its dependence on @xmath150 is more complicated than other decay modes .",
    "the reason may be that @xmath150 not only affects the masses and mixings of squarks , but also affects the higgs boson mass and its mixing angles , and , further , it enters the interaction of @xmath181 .    an interesting feature , shown in figs .",
    "[ decay1]-[decay7 ] is that the branching ratio of @xmath182 is always smaller than the higher order decay @xmath113 .",
    "this was observed in the sm @xcite and the mssm @xcite , and it indicates that the qcd corrections to @xmath153 may be important .",
    "two reasons may account for this behavior .",
    "one is that the qcd factor in the amplitude - square for @xmath183 is much larger than that for @xmath107 .",

    "top decays comparatively , we now consider the fcnc top quark production channels . at the lhc the production proceeds through the six parton - level processes shown in eqs .",
    "( [ pro-1]-[processes ] ) , among which only @xmath63 has been extensively studied in the mssm@xcite . in calculating the cross section for each channel",

    "[ product1]-[product7 ] .",
    "these figures exhibit the same features as the fcnc top quark decays in fig .",
    "[ decay1]-[decay7 ] .",
    "thus we do not repeat drawing attention to the same features , and we only point out three remarkable points of these diagrams .",
    "the first is that the rate of @xmath186 is generally larger than that for @xmath63 .",
    "this is possible because the charm quark in the parton distributions mainly comes from the splitting of a gluon @xcite and thus @xmath0 can be seen as @xmath63 with the final charm quark going along the beam pipe . analyzing the signal versus background @xcite , it seems that @xmath187 provides a better opportunity for the observation of top production .",
    "the second point is that the rate of @xmath188 is comparable to @xmath101 in most cases .",
    "this coincides with the results in @xcite where both modes were studied in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "since the two processes have the same signals at colliders , namely single top plus one light - quark jet , one should combine these two when searching for the fcnc top production events .",
    "the third point is that in most cases the cross section for @xmath189 is one order of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath101 .",
    "the reason is that although @xmath190 can proceed either through @xmath111 interaction or @xmath191 interaction , the two interactions interfere destructively and thus the combined contributions are suppressed .",
    "as shown above , in most of parameter space the rates are expected to be quite small at the lhc . in order to study the observability of such rare processes ,",
    "it is necessary to scan the whole parameter space to figure out the maximum value that each process can reach .",
    "we call the ` favorable region ' the part of parameter space which gives the maximum value for the rate of an individual channel .",
    "of course , such favorable region is process - dependent . in what follows",
    "we take @xmath101 as an example to carry out such a parameter scan explicitly . in the next section ,",

    "if @xmath149 is fixed , @xmath150 value is related to @xmath118 .",
    "since both @xmath150 and @xmath118 are the off - diagonal elements in squark mass matrix , a large @xmath150 will correspond to a small @xmath118 and vice versa . then from eq .",

    "we see that the maximal cross section values increases with @xmath149 , and for non - zero @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , case i ( ii ) gives the largest prediction for the cross sections .",

    "firstly , since the mixing terms appear as the non - diagonal elements of squark mass matrices , they can affect the squark mass spectrum , especially by enlarging the mass splitting between squarks .",
    "therefore they should be constrained by the squark mass bounds from the direct experimental searches . at the same time , since the squark loops affect the precision electroweak quantities such as @xmath209 and the effective weak mixing angle @xmath210@xcite , such mixings could also be constrained by precision electroweak measurements . as shown in@xcite , to a good approximation",

    "<S> we systematically calculate various flavor - changing neutral - current top - quark processes induced by supersymmetry at the large hadron collider , which include five decay modes and six production channels . to reveal the characteristics of these processes , we first compare the dependence of the rates for these channels on the relevant supersymmetric parameters </S>",
    "<S> , then we scan the whole parameter space to find their maximal rates , including all the direct and indirect current experimental constraints on the scharm - stop flavor mixings . </S>",
