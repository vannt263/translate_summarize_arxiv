    "a long - standing problem of galaxy formation and evolution has been understanding the relation between gas surface density ( @xmath1 ) and star formation rate ( sfr ; i.e. , the star formation law ) . in the last half century",
    ", significant efforts have been undertaken to clarify this subject .",
    "empirical correlations have been found between the disk surface density of star formation , @xmath3 , and the gas surface density , @xmath1 either total , neutral or molecular ( usually based on co ) .",
    "examples of these are @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the average angular velocity of the gas in the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "data are often compatible with more than one correlation at a time , a situation that does not help to clarify what processes really drive star formation rates ( e.g. , turbulence , large scale shocks , gravitational instabilities , shear , pressure ) .    the sfr is often measured through the emission in the h@xmath10 line , that is due to the reprocessed ionizing photons produced by o or early b - type stars , or via the non - ionizing far ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux dominated by b - type stars . in order to infer the sfr in this way , then , the relation between the mass in massive stars and the rest , i.e. , the initial mass function ( imf ) , has to be known .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found that , on average , for large samples of galaxies , the sfrs inferred , respectively , from the h@xmath10 line and the fuv flux are not consistent with a universal imf .",
    "instead , the ratio between h@xmath10 and fuv seems to decline with galaxy luminosity or galaxy mass or sfr or sfr per area .",
    "@xcite conclude that none of the following factors can cause this trend if acting alone : uncertainties in stellar evolution and atmospheres , effects of different metallicities , variations of star formation histories , photon leakage , extinction , and stochasticity of massive star formation .",
    "one particular case of the mismatch between the h@xmath10 and the fuv emissions occurs in the outer regions of disk galaxies .",
    "historically , the h@xmath10 cut - off there led to the concept of a gas surface density threshold , below which star formation activity was inhibited , and the relationships shown above between @xmath1 and sfr broke down @xcite . recently",
    "available uv data , however , show that there is no corresponding  fuv cut - off \" , and that star formation also goes on in outer spiral disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose the _",
    "local _ integrated galaxial imf [ ( l)igimf ] theory , that is able to explain both the h@xmath10 cut - off in galaxy disks , and the trend in the ratio of h@xmath10 to fuv fluxes with galaxy mass .",
    "the ( l)igimf theory deals with surface densities ( e.g. , the local imf and sfr densities ) , and is an outgrowth of the igimf theory @xcite .",
    "the igimf theory is based on the simple concept that star formation , in the form of embedded clusters , occurs in molecular cloud cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although most of these embedded clusters do not survive as bound star clusters the expulsion of their residual gas , the determination of the stellar imf of the whole galaxy or of a part of it at a given time reduces to adding the stellar imfs of all newly formed embedded clusters . on the other hand , the embedded cluster maximum mass , @xmath12 , seems to be a function of the total sfr @xcite , and the stellar upper mass limit of each cluster s imf is a function of the total star cluster mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting igimf , then , depends on the sfr , which itself depends on the gas density . in order to account for",
    "the h@xmath10 cut - off in exponential gas disks , @xcite adopt the ansatz @xmath13 .",
    "another correlation between maximum cluster mass and sfr surface density has been proposed by @xcite , based on the star formation law , and assuming the ambient interstellar medium and the cluster - forming cloud cores are in pressure equilibrium . in this scenario , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "the first value is expected in the case of equal ( volume ) density clusters @xcite , while the second would occur if clusters have equal sizes @xcite , as is supported by the very weak birth radius - cluster mass relation @xcite .    in view of the limited availability of sufficiently accurate cluster mass determinations",
    "a decade ago , the relationship between maximum cluster _ luminosity _ and @xmath3 was investigated by @xcite using _ hst _ data of 6 spiral galaxies .",
    "he concluded , however , that the effects of random sampling statistics in determining the brightest observed cluster luminosities would make it hard to unveil the connection between physical processes and maximum star cluster mass , and that a study performed with masses , not luminosities , would be much better to establish how maximum cluster mass depends on galaxy properties . at present , the widely held understanding is that the most massive object in an ensemble of clusters scales with the sample size as a result of statistical variations . on the other hand , if there is a physical link between the most massive clusters and the sfr , then a potentially very powerful new method of measuring star formation histories of galaxies is opened up @xcite .    here , we test the environment dependent igimf ansatz versus the stochastic sampling ansatz .",
    "we make a direct comparison between cluster mass and gas surface density in m  33 , using data from the literature , with the aim of investigating whether @xmath1 has a role in determining maximum cluster mass .",
    "we will from now on refer to maximum cluster mass as @xmath0 exclusively .",
    "@xcite have recently published a study of 648 clusters younger than 10@xmath16 yr in the disk of m  33 , out to @xmath17 16 kpc of the galaxy center , selected from the spitzer 24 @xmath18 m image of the galaxy @xcite . @xcite",

    "we extracted the masses and galactocentric radii of the clusters from fig .  13 in @xcite using the tool dexter @xcite .",
    "owing to different surface brightness and crowding characteristics , the completeness limit varies with radius , and goes from 800 - 1000 @xmath28 within about 0.6 @xmath19 to @xmath29 beyond @xmath19 . in what follows",

    "1.20 @xmath19 , and 1.28 @xmath19 , with masses , respectively , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are out of the figure , to the right .",
    "] we constructed 7 bins covering the range with both neutral and molecular gas data , i.e. , between the galactic center and 0.8 @xmath19 , each one 4@xmath5004 ( 1 kpc , @xmath51 ) wide .",

    "the median of the five most massive clusters in the same bins ( or the third most massive cluster in each bin ) , and a linear fit to the median are displayed as red filled circles and a solid line ; the error bars represent the interquartile range .",
    "since the uncertainty in the measurement of any individual mass is typically a factor of 2 - 3 , fits to the mean and the median of the 5 most massive clusters in each bin should in general be more robust indicators of any existing trend ( in every bin there are always more than 5 clusters more massive than the completeness limit ) .",
    "using this mean or median is even more necessary in this case , since we intend to compare cluster masses , not with the gas surface densities at their position , but with azimuthal averages at their galactocentric distance .",
    "the rms azimuthal variations are always below 5% of the co and mid - ir emission , and below 2% of the hi and hi+co emission .    from the weighted fit to the mean , we obtain : @xmath54 the fit to the median yields : @xmath55    we note that there is an extremely massive cluster at @xmath56 , almost at the edge of the available h@xmath31 data and beyond the published radial profiles of @xmath57 and @xmath3 .",
    "this cluster , the most massive in the galaxy with @xmath58 , sits over one of the brightest spots in the co j=1 - 0 map , while there is very little emission detected from the rest of the galaxy at the same galactocentric distance ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 2 . ) .",
    "the region is also quite bright at 21 cm , and is the brightest location between 24 and 170 @xmath18 m @xcite .",
    "hence , the azimuthally averaged emission of the corresponding annulus would not be representative of the star - forming conditions at the location of the cluster .",
    "this cluster has , instead , formed in a local major instability in the interstellar medium .",
    "the sfr and gas surface densities @xcite , and our linear fits to the data are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fm33rad ] .",
    "the x - axes of both panels in the figure are the same , whereas the y - axes have the same dynamic ranges , so that the slopes of fits to gas surface densities and cluster masses are directly comparable .",
    "the fits to the available gas are : @xmath59 for m  33 , then , both the mean and the median of the 5 most massive clusters yield : @xmath60 ; @xmath61 ; @xmath62 .",
    "we discard here the possibility that the change in mean and median maximum cluster mass with radius is a statistical effect , due to the number of clusters in each equal sized bin decreasing with increasing radius . if clusters are drawn purely randomly , or stochastically , from the same mass distribution function that declines with mass , and that has a constant upper truncation mass @xmath63 , the probability of picking a massive cluster decreases with the size of the sample , i.e. , with the number of clusters in the sample .",
    "we demonstrate in the following that the change in maximum mass is due to physical causes instead .",
    "figure  [ m33_sos ] shows fits to the median mass clusters in bins , each one containing an equal number of objects from the subsample of 258 clusters with @xmath46 detected by @xcite in m  33 ; the total number of bins increases from 3 ( upper left panel ) to 6 ( lower left panel ) .",
    "the number of clusters in each bin is indicated , and the maximum and median masses are shown , respectively , with black empty triangles and red filled circles .",
    "two fits to the medians are performed : one including all the bins in each panel ( red dashed line ) , and one omitting the last bin ( blue solid line ) ; this bin includes a radial range for which there is no molecular gas data , and always contains the most massive cluster in m  33 ( see above ) , an object whose characteristics do not seem to correlate with the average star - forming conditions at its galactocentric radius .",
    "the fits have the form : @xmath64 and their coefficients and their uncertainties are listed , respectively , in the top and bottom of table 1 . when the last bin is included , the slopes @xmath65 of these fits get slowly steeper , as the number of bins increases ( see top of table 1 ) and the relative importance of the last bin progressively diminishes . if , on the other hand , we exclude the last bin , we find that the slope of the fits to the median cluster mass is @xmath66 ( see table 1 , bottom ) , regardless of the number of bins .",

    "we note here , though , that for large samples ( for example , of a few hundred clusters ) the mass of the 90@xmath79 percentile point might already be one or two orders of magnitude below that of the most massive clusters , and hence would not be a good estimator for this particular problem .    in order to convince the reader that the intrinsic mass distribution of clusters changes as a function of radius ,",

    "whose formation environment is certainly not represented by the average conditions across the galaxy at its galactocentric distance , and for the lack of gas data beyond this same radius , we find exactly the same results as before , regardless of the width of the bins .",
    "a k - s test on the mass distributions in these bins suggests that the two bins closest to the galaxy center are different from the two most external ones , i.e. , that the mass distribution function changes with radius .    the significant decrease of @xmath93 with radial distance in m  33 , as a power law with index @xmath94 , and despite there being the same number of clusters per radial bin , rules out random sampling with extremely high confidence .",
