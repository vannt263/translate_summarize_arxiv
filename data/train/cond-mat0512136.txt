    "the earth s solid outer crust , about 20 kilometers in average thickness , rests on the tectonic shells . due to the high temperature - pressure phase changes and the consequent powerful convective flow in the earth s mantle ( a fluid of very high density ) , at several hundreds of kilometers of depth , the tectonic shell , divided into a small number ( about ten ) of mobile plates , has relative velocities of the order of a few centimeters per year @xcite . over several tens of years",
    ", enormous elastic strains develop on the earth s crust when sticking ( due to the solid - solid friction ) to the moving tectonic plate .",
    "when sudden slips occur between the crust and the tectonic plate , these stored elastic energies are released in ` bursts ' , causing the damages during the earthquakes .",
    "earthquakes occur due to fault dynamics in the lithosphere . a geological fault is created by a fracture in the rock layers , and is comprised of the rock surfaces in contact .",
    "the two parts of the fault are in very slow relative motion which causes the surfaces to slide . because of the uniform motion of the tectonic plates , the elastic strain energy stored in a portion of the crust ( block ) , moving with the plate relative to a ` stationary ' neighboring part of the crust , can vary only due to the random strength of the solid - solid friction between the crust and the plate .",
    "a slip occurs when the accumulated stress exceeds the resistance due to the frictional force .",
    "the potential energy of the strain is thereby released , causing an earthquake .",
    "as mentioned before , the observed distribution of the elastic energy release in various earthquakes seems to follow a power law .",
    "the slip is eventually stopped by friction and stress starts developing again .",
    "strain continues to develop till the fault surfaces again slip .",
    "this intermittent stick - slip process is the essential characteristic feature of fault dynamics .",
    "the overall distribution of earthquakes , including main shocks , foreshocks and aftershocks , is given by the gutenberg - richter law @xcite : @xmath0 where , @xmath1 denotes the number ( or , the frequency ) of earthquakes of magnitudes @xmath2 that are greater than a certain value @xmath3 .",
    "the constant @xmath4 represents the total number of earthquakes of all magnitudes : @xmath5 and the value of the coefficient @xmath6 is presumed to be universal . in an alternative form , the gutenberg - richter law is expressed as a relation for the number ( or , the frequency ) of earthquakes in which the energy released @xmath7 is greater than a certain value @xmath8 : @xmath9 for the number density of earthquakes , where @xmath10 .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath11 is generally observed to be around unity @xcite ; see also http://web.cz3.nus.edu.sg/`~`chenk/gem2503_3/notes7_1.htm .",
    "one class of models for simulating earthquakes is based on the collective motion of an assembly of connected elements that are driven slowly , of which the block - spring model due to burridge and knopoff @xcite is the prototype . the burridge - knopoff model and its variants @xcite",
    "have the stick - slip dynamics necessary to produce earthquakes .",
    "the underlying principle in this class of models is self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "another class of models for simulating earthquakes is based on overlapping fractals , which will be discusses in details in the next sections .",
    "a fractal is a geometrical object that displays self - similarity on all scales . for random fractals ,",
    "the object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales , but the same ` type ' of structures appear on all scales .",
    "for example , the black sea coastline measured with different length rulers will show differences : the shorter the ruler , the longer the ` length ' measured but not exactly following the ratio of the inverse of the lengths of the rulers ; greater than that !",
    "this is because more structures come into play at lower length scales ; or in other words , the coastline is not really a ` line ' but rather a fractal having dimension greater than unity .",
    "looking at smaller and smaller length - scales , one can find self - similar structures ( see fig .",
    "[ deadsea ] )",
    ".    one can easily construct such regular fractals as carpets or gaskets ( see fig . [ gasket ] ) . in fig [ gasket ] , a basic unit of equilateral triangle with an inner triangle obtained by joining the mid - points of each side and keeping the inner space void ,",
    "one constructs a gasket . at each step , as the length of each side changes by a factor @xmath12 , the mass of the fractal changes by a factor @xmath13 , giving therefore the fractal dimension of the object to be @xmath14 .",
    "this object in fig .",
    "[ gasket ] of course represents a non - random fractal .",
    "however , a random fractal ( as in fig . [ deadsea ] ) can be easily constructed if the void is not always at the center but at any of the @xmath15 triangles at random for each generation ; the ( mass ) dimension @xmath16 remain the same .",
    "a similar fractal of dimension @xmath17 can be constructed as the cantor set shown in fig .",
    "[ cantor ] . starting from a set of all real numbers from @xmath18 to @xmath19",
    "one removes the subset from the middle third , so that for each @xmath20 , the mass ( size ) of the set @xmath21 and hence the dimension as @xmath22 .",
    "this void subset can again be randomly chosen , giving a random cantor set , with same @xmath16 .",
    "overlapping fractals form a whole class of models to simulate earthquake dynamics .",
    "these models are motivated by the observation that a fault surface , like a fractured surface @xcite , is a fractal object @xcite .",
    "consequently a fault may be viewed as a pair of overlapping fractals .",
    "fractional brownian profiles have been commonly used as models of fault surfaces @xcite . in that case",
    "the dynamics of a fault is represented by one brownian profile drifting on another and each intersection of the two profiles corresponds to an earthquake @xcite . however the simplest possible model of a fault @xmath23 from the fractal point of view @xmath23 was proposed by chakrabarti and stinchcombe @xcite .",
    "this model is a schematic representation of a fault by a pair of dynamically overlapping cantor sets .",
    "it is not realistic but , as a system of overlapping fractals , it has the essential feature . since the cantor set is a fractal with a simple construction procedure , it allows us to study in detail the statistics of the overlap of one fractal object on another .",
    "the two fractal overlap magnitude changes in time as one fractal moves over the other .",
    "the overlap ( magnitude ) time series can therefore be studied as a model time series of earthquake avalanche dynamics @xcite .",
    "the statistics of overlaps between two fractals is not studied much yet , though their knowledge is often required in various physical contexts .",
    "it has been established recently that since the fractured surfaces have got well - characterized self - affine properties , the distribution of the elastic energies released during the slips between two fractal surfaces ( earthquake events ) may follow the overlap distribution of two self - similar fractal surfaces @xcite .",
    "chakrabarti and stinchcombe @xcite had shown analytically by renormalization group calculations that for regular fractal overlap ( cantor sets and carpets ) the contact area distribution @xmath24 follows a simple power law decay : @xmath25 study of the time ( @xmath26 ) variation of contact area ( overlap ) @xmath27 between two well - characterized fractals having the same fractal dimension as one fractal moves over the other with constant velocity , has revealed some features which can be utilized to predict the ` large events ' @xcite .",
    "bhattacharyya @xcite has recently studied this overlap distribution for two cantor sets with periodic boundary conditions and each having dimension @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown , using exact counting , that if @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the generation number ) then the probability @xmath30 to get an overlap @xmath31 is given by a binomial distribution @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] . expressing therefore @xmath34 by @xmath35 near the maxima of @xmath30",
    ", one can again rewrite ( [ binomial ] ) as @xmath36 noting that @xmath37 , we find @xmath38 , @xmath39 , as in ( [ eq : gr ] ) as the binomial or gaussian part becomes a very weak function of @xmath31 as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that this exponent value @xmath39 is independent of the dimension of the cantor sets considered ( here @xmath17 ) or for that matter , independent of the fractals employed .",
    "it also denotes the general validity of ( [ eq : gr ] ) even for disordered fractals , as observed numerically @xcite .",
    "identifying the contact area or overlap @xmath31 between the self - similar ( fractal ) crust and tectonic plate surfaces as the stored elastic energy @xmath8 released during the slip , the distribution ( [ eq : gr ] ) , of which a derivation is partly indicated here , reduces to the gutenberg - richter law ( [ eq : g - r - power - law ] ) observed .",
    "we introduce here the two - fractal overlap model of earthquake where the average distribution of the overlaps between the surfaces , as one fractal ( here , cantor set ) moves over the other gives the gutenberg - richter like distribution ( [ eq : gr ] ) , with @xmath39 exactly in the model .",
    "we note that this is an exactly solvable model of earthquake dynamics and the result for the distributions compare favorably with the observations .",
