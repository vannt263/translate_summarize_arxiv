    "toral automorphisms or _ cat maps _ , by which we mean the action of matrices @xmath1 on the @xmath2-torus @xmath3 , are a widely used and versatile class of dynamical systems , see @xcite for some classic results in the context of ergodic theory . of particular interest are the hyperbolic and quasi - hyperbolic ones , which are characterised by having no root of unity among their eigenvalues .",
    "all periodic orbits of such automorphisms lie on the rational ( or finite ) invariant lattices @xmath4 , which are also known as the @xmath5-division points .",
    "one can encode the possible periods of a toral automorphism @xmath6 on @xmath3 via the dynamical zeta function in a systematic way , which is always a rational function @xcite .",
    "the literature on classifying periodic orbits of toral automorphisms when @xmath7 is vast ( compare @xcite and references therein ) . an extension beyond @xmath7 is difficult due to the fact that the conjugacy problem between integer matrices is then much harder because ( unlike @xmath7 ) no complete set of conjugacy invariants mod @xmath5 is known .",
    "therefore , our focus will also be on @xmath7 , with occasional extensions to higher dimensions .",
    "the larger ring @xmath8 of toral endomorphisms ( which includes integer matrices without integer inverses ) has received far less attention @xcite , particularly those in the complement of @xmath9 .",
    "note that the resulting dynamics induced by @xmath10 on a finite lattice @xmath11 may or may not be invertible . in the latter case , beyond periodic orbits",
    ", there exist _ eventually periodic _ orbits which possess points that lead into a periodic orbit .",
    "we call these points and the periodic point to which they attach the ` pretails ' to the periodic orbit ( see eq .   for a formal definition ) .",
    "the action of @xmath6 induces a directed graph on @xmath12 ( e.g.  see our three figures below ) .",
    "alternatively , the pretails can be combined to form a rooted _ tree _ which is a characteristic attribute to any pair @xmath13 .    as well as their interest from a mathematical viewpoint , toral automorphisms",
    "also have been well - studied from a physics perspective , in particular as quantum cat maps ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here , the action of the integer matrix on a rational lattice @xmath11 , for some @xmath5 , is all - important as quantum cat maps and their perturbations are built from ( classical ) cat maps and their perturbations _ restricted to a particular rational lattice _",
    "( called the wigner lattice in this instance ) .",
    "there has been recent interest in dealing with so - called pseudo - symmetries of quantum cat maps that are manifestations of local symmetries of cat maps restricted to some rational lattice @xcite .",
    "although , in the context of quantisation , matrices from the group @xmath14 play the key role , we prefer to work with the larger group of unimodular integer matrices and consider the former as a special case .",
    "the main aims of this paper are twofold :  ( i ) to elucidate the orbit structure of toral endomorphisms on rational lattices , equivalently the periodic orbits together with the related pretail tree structure ; ( ii ) to further characterise the nature of symmetries or ( time ) reversing symmetries of toral automorphisms , these being automorphisms of the torus ( or of a rational lattice ) that commute with the cat map , respectively conjugate it into its inverse .",
    "we expand a little on our results , where we refer to the actual formulation below in the paper .",
    "the results are readable without the surrounding notational details .",
    "with respect to aim ( i ) , section [ sec : orbit ] characterises the splitting of @xmath11 into periodic and eventually periodic points under a toral endomorphism @xmath6 .",
    "every periodic point has a pretail graph isomorphic to that of the fixed point @xmath15 ( corollary [ coro : p - tree ] ) , which is trivial if and only if @xmath6 is invertible on @xmath11 . in general ,",
    "the pretail tree codes important information on the action of @xmath6 .",
    "one question in this context is whether all _ maximal _ pretails have the same length , for which we give a partial answer via a sufficient condition on @xmath16 in proposition [ prop : pre - length ] . given @xmath6 , the lattice @xmath11 can be decomposed into into 2 invariant submodules , one of which captures the invertible part of @xmath6 and the other the nilpotent part . this way , we are able to characterise the dynamics that is induced by @xmath6 on @xmath11 in the case of @xmath17 , @xmath18 prime , in corollary [ c : blockdiagonal ] and lemma [ l : mipodecomp ] .",
    "our contribution towards aim ( ii ) continues the investigations from @xcite . the key quantity for integer matrices of dimension @xmath0 is the @xmath19 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : mgcd - def ] below ) , and one consequence of ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) is that @xmath20 is always conjugate to its inverse on @xmath11 , for each @xmath21 . the conjugating element  called a reversing symmetry or reversor  is an integer matrix that has an integer matrix inverse on @xmath11 , which typically depends on @xmath5 . in this way ,",
    "any @xmath22 matrix that fails to be conjugate to its inverse on the torus ( e.g.@xmath23 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ) is still conjugate to its inverse on every rational lattice . in @xcite",
    ", we did not consider the nature of the reversor on the lattice .",
    "theorem [ thm : local - rev ] of section [ sec : revsym ] establishes that it is an orientation - reversing involution , what is called an anticanonical ( time - reversal ) symmetry in the language of @xcite . section [ sec:4.2 ] uses normal forms of @xmath24 to characterise the symmetries and possible reversing symmetries of such matrices ; the underlying structure of the conjugacy classes of @xmath24 is summarised in table  [ tab : finite - field ] .",
    "the symmetry structure has some extensions to higher dimensions ( section [ sec:4.3 ] ) and to general modulus @xmath5 ( section [ sec:4.4 ] ) . section [ sec:4.5 ] presents some results for the case when @xmath25 has a root in the same group .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : prelim ] summarises some properties of integer matrices that we use later in the paper , with some reformulations or slight generalisations that we find useful . in particular , throughout the paper , we formulate the results for arbitrary dimension whenever it is possible without extra complications , though this is not our main focus .",
    "as described , section [ sec : orbit ] addresses aim ( i ) above , while section [ sec : revsym ] deals with aim ( ii ) . in the appendix",
    ", we briefly discuss two classic examples of toral automorphisms for @xmath7 and some aspects of their dynamics .",
    "the purpose of this section is to summarise important properties of and around integer matrices that are needed later on , with focus on those that are not standard textbook material . at the same time",
    ", we introduce our notation . for general background on integer matrices and their connections to algebraic number theory",
    ", we refer to the classic text by taussky @xcite .",
    "the most important lattices on the torus @xmath26 , which is a compact abelian group , consist of the @xmath5-division points @xmath27 with @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath11 are invariant under toral endomorphisms ( with the action of the representing matrices taken mod @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is sometimes easier to replace @xmath12 by the set @xmath29 , with the equivalent action of @xmath6 defined mod @xmath5 .",
    "this also applies to various theoretical arguments involving modular arithmetic .",
    "consequently , we use @xmath12 ( with action of @xmath6 mod @xmath28 ) and @xmath30 ( with action mod @xmath5 ) in parallel .",
    "our discussion will revolve around the residue class ring @xmath31 with @xmath21 , which is a principal ideal ring , but not a domain , unless @xmath32 is a prime . in the latter case",

    "formula follows from the corresponding one for @xmath17 via the chinese remainder theorem , while the simpler prime power case is a consequence of the observation that each element of a non - singular matrix @xmath6 over @xmath43 can be covered ( independently of all other matrix elements ) by @xmath18 elements in @xmath44 without affecting its non - singularity .",
    "let us finally mention that @xmath45 , the subgroup of matrices with determinant @xmath28 , is a normal subgroup ( it is the kernel of @xmath46 ) .",
    "the factor group is @xmath47 and thus has order @xmath48 .",
    "the orbit statistics of the action of a matrix @xmath49 on the lattice @xmath12 is encapsulated in the polynomial @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the number of @xmath52-cycles of @xmath6 on @xmath12 .",
