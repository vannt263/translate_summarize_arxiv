    "the astrometry for both the _ galex _ and sdss surveys is sufficiently accurate that the typical astrometric errors are much smaller than the average source separation ; this significantly simplifies the matching algorithm .",
    "we began by correlating the _ galex _ source positions with positions in the sdss catalog , taking a @xmath1 matching radius .",

    "of matched _ galex _ sources have more than one sdss counterpart .",
    "this is consistent with random matching , based on the mean separation between two sdss sources of @xmath2@xmath63 . in these cases , we simply take the closest match for evaluating sample completeness , and limit the matching radius to @xmath64 when studying colors of matched sources in  4 ( for this matching radius , less than 1% of _ galex _ matches have more than one sdss counterpart )",
    ".    a closer look at the matches  and especially the non  matches , those _ galex _ objects without an sdss counterpart  shows clear structure in the pattern of matching ( see the lower left panel in fig .",
    "[ onsky ] ) .",
    "objects along the edges of the _ galex _ field of view are far more likely not to have an optical counterpart .",
    "this is due mainly to distortions in the _ galex _ fields and to problems in the flat  fielding along the field edges ; as a result , many spurious sources are detected by the _",
    "data analysis pipeline ( t.  wyder 2004 , private communication ) . to avoid this contamination , we select an inclusion distance from the _ galex _ field center of r  @xmath65 , which defines the size of the effective area of each of the three fields overlapping with sdss .",
    "we then have @xmath66 _ galex _ sources with sdss counterparts , and only @xmath67 without a match within @xmath1 , or @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , of the total number of _ galex _ sources within the area defined above .",
    "further cuts are then applied to the data to obtain the highest quality sample of _ galex_/sdss sources .",
    "we determined the _ galex _ faint completeness limit from a histogram of the @xmath31 magnitudes of _ galex _ sources with an sdss counterpart and within @xmath70 of their respective field centers ( fig .",

    "we require that the optical counterpart be a unique detection and not saturated in sdss ( for details see stoughton et al .",
    "we also require that the _ galex _ artifact flag be set to zero for both the near  uv and far  uv detections .",
    "bright star halos appear to be one of the major sources of artifacts in both the nuv and fuv _ galex _ data sets , while other problems ( dichroic ghosts or detector hot spots , for example ) tend to affect preferentially one set of detections or the other for a full description of _ galex _ image artifacts . ] .",

    "we note that eliminating matches based on the _ galex _ nuv / fuv flags strongly impacts the spatial distribution of acceptable matches , so that there now seems to be a dearth of clean sources near the edges of the r  @xmath75 disks .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the _ galex _ flags are in fact too conservative , and that we are losing good matches in these regions .",

    "the magnitude difference normalized by the expected error has an rms scatter of 1.4 , and 1.9 at the bright end .",
    "this demonstrates that the photometric errors are computed fairly accurately by the _ galex _",
    "photometric pipeline , and that systematic errors at the bright end are not very large .",
    "in this section we first compare the optical properties of matched sources to the full sdss sample , and then extend our analysis by combining uv , optical , and ir data from the _ galex _ , sdss , and 2mass surveys .",

    "we find that the observed range of the @xmath168 color can be explained by a small contribution of agn  like emission to an otherwise normal ( `` old red and dead '' ) elliptical galaxy .",

    "that is , the @xmath123 color is dominated by the agn contribution and becomes 0.30 ( with @xmath173 ) .",
    "the addition of such a low  level agn emission would likely go undetected in sdss spectra .",

    "when the snr cutoff is imposed on other lines needed to construct the bpt diagram ( baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ) , such agn emission is practically unnoticeable in sdss spectra , although it dominates the _ galex _ flux measurements !",

    "it should be noted that it is not obvious what exactly the @xmath123 color measures .",
    "for example , seibert et al .  ( 2005b ) tested the canonical uv color  attenuation ( irx@xmath178 ) relation for starburst galaxies with a sample of _ galex _ and _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) galaxies , and found that it consistently overestimates the attenuation they derive from their sample by half a magnitude . while @xmath123 is certainly expected to be affected by dust attenuation ( e.g. , kong et al .  2004 , buat et al .",
    "2005 ) , the distribution of galaxies in the @xmath161 vs @xmath123 diagram implies that the ages of the dominant stellar populations and the corresponding star ",
    "formation rates must play a significant role in determining the color of a galaxy ( as opposed to simply reflecting a varying degree of reddening of one and the same intrinsic stellar population in different galaxies ) .    finally , models have some difficulties producing @xmath123 colors at the extreme blue edge @xmath179 ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "while this discrepancy could of course point to suspect observations ( e.g. , non  gaussian photometric errors ) , the modeling of far  uv colors of galaxies is notoriously difficult due to the unknown spatial distribution of dust and to the poorly constrained dust opacity in this wavelength range .",
