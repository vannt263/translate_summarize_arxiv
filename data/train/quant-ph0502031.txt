    "two quantum mechanical observables are called complementary if and only if precise knowledge of one of them implies that all possible outcomes are equally probable when measuring the other , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the principle of complementarity was introduced by bohr  @xcite in 1928 , and it had a profound impact on the further development of quantum mechanics .",
    "a recent application is the quantum key exchange protocol by bennett and brassard  @xcite that exploits complementarity to secure the key exchange against eavesdropping .",

    "the complementarity of @xmath5 and @xmath6 implies that if a quantum system is prepared in an eigenstate @xmath10 of the observable @xmath6 , and @xmath5 is subsequently measured , then the probability to find the system after the measurement in the state @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 .",

    "precisely when @xmath12 holds for all @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "thus the eigenbases of non - degenerate complementary observables are mutually unbiased .",
    "conversely , we can associate to a pair of mutually unbiased bases a pair of non - degenerate complementary observables .",
    "there is a fundamental property of mutually unbiased bases that is invaluable in quantum information processing .",
    "suppose that we want to determine the density matrix @xmath15 of an ensemble of quantum systems using as few non - degenerate observables as possible .",
    "we assume that it is possible to make a complete measurement of each observable @xmath16 , meaning that the statistics @xmath17 is known for each eigenvalue @xmath18 in the spectral decomposition .",
    "ivanovi showed in @xcite that complete measurements of at least @xmath0 observables are needed to reconstruct the density matrix .",
    "he also showed that this lower bound is attained when @xmath0 non - degenerate pairwise complementary observables are used .",
    "a simple example is provided by the pauli spin matrices @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "a complete measurement of these three observables allows to reconstruct a @xmath22 density matrix , a fact apparently known to schwinger  @xcite .",
