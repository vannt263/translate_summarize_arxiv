    "modern cosmological research rests heavily on observational data .",
    "any theoretical model should be corroborated with observation for understanding the viability of that model .",
    "present cosmological picture , emerging out of this theory - observation combination , reveals that , the total energy - density of the universe is dominated by two dark components , viz .",
    ", dark matter and dark energy .",
    "observational evidence from various independent sources including sn ia@xcite suggest that the cosmic expansion is speeding up , i.e. accelerating .",
    "this acceleration is supposed to be caused by a yet unknown exotic energy , termed as dark energy .",
    "a special feature of dark energy is that it exerts negative pressure which acts as a repulsive force initiating the observed acceleration .",
    "not only that , it is now well - accepted that about two - third of the total energy - density comes in terms of dark energy while the remaining one - third is contributed by matter , both visible and dark@xcite .",
    "now , dark matter played a significant role in the early universe during structure formation because it clumps in sub - megaparsec scales .",
    "but , the exact composition of dark matter is still unknown . since small density perturbation ( @xmath4 at @xmath5 ) measured by cobe and cmb experiments@xcite rule out baryonic dark matter and hot dark matter like light neutrinos do not support hierarchical structure formation @xcite , so most of the dark matter must be cold and non - baryonic . on the other hand , clustering of cold dark matter on small scale@xcite supports the hierarchical structure formation .",
    "moreover , after introduction of the idea of accelerating universe , the previous standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) models have fallen out of grace@xcite and is replaced by @xmath0-cdm or lcdm model for including dark energy as a part of the total energy density of the universe .",
    "@xmath0-cdm model is found to be in nice agreement with various sets of observations@xcite .",
    "an advantage of @xmath0-cdm model is that it assumes a nearly scale - invariant primordial perturbations and a universe with no spatial curvature .",
    "these were predicted by inflationary scenario@xcite .",
    "now , a problem with @xmath0-cdm model is that the acceleration of the universe can not be a permanent feature starting from the big - bang . because , an accelerating universe is not favorable for structure formation .",
    "this problem can be removed if one assumes that the acceleration of the universe is a recent phenomena .",
    "in fact , some recent works@xcite show that the present accelerating phase was preceded by a decelerating one and observational evidence@xcite also supports this idea .",
    "the present work is done with this background in mind .",
    "phenomenological approach is one of the several ways of searching such dark energy . in a recent work@xcite",
    ", the equivalence of three phenomenological variable @xmath0 models have been shown .",
    "the behaviour of the same three forms of @xmath0 have been studied when both @xmath6 and @xmath0 vary@xcite .",
    "but , in both those works the equation of state parameter @xmath2 was considered as a constant because , due to inability of current observational data in separating a time - varying @xmath2 from a constant one@xcite , in most of the cases a constant value of @xmath2 is used .",
    "however , @xmath2 , in general , is a function of time@xcite .",
    "it has already been commented by ray et al.@xcite that for a more accurate result , an investigation regarding time evolution of @xmath2 may be taken up for searching better physical features .",
    "in fact , the statefinder diagnostic , used for distinguishing various dark energy models , can be applied if the equation of state of scalar potential has a direct relationship with the hubble parameter and its derivative@xcite .    with those features of @xmath3 and @xmath2 in mind , an investigation about the @xmath0-cdm universe",
    "is done by selecting a specific time - dependent form of @xmath0 , viz .",
    ", @xmath7 .",
    "this particular time - varying @xmath0 model was studied by reuter and wetterich@xcite for finding a mechanism which would explain the present small value of @xmath0 as a result of the cosmic evolution . in the present work ,",
    "the same @xmath0 model is used for investigating a time evolving equation of state parameter @xmath2 along with a possible signature flip of the deceleration parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this change of sign is very important for @xmath0-cdm cosmology .",
    "the einstein field equations are given by @xmath8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cosmological term @xmath0 is time - dependent , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the velocity of light in vacuum , is assumed to be unity .",
    "let us consider the robertson - walker metric @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , the curvature constant , assumes the values @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for open , flat and closed models of the universe respectively and @xmath16 is the scale factor .",
    "for the spherically symmetric metric ( 2 ) , field equations ( 1 ) yield friedmann and raychaudhuri equations respectively given by @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath6 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the gravitational constant , matter energy density and pressure respectively and the hubble parameter @xmath21 is related to the scale factor by @xmath22 . in the present work",
    ", @xmath6 is assumed to be constant .",
    "the generalized energy conservation law for variable @xmath6 and @xmath0 is derived by shapiro et al.@xcite using renormalization group theory and also by vereshchagin and yegorian@xcite using a formula of gurzadyan and xue@xcite .",
    "vereshchagin and yegorian@xcite have presented a phase portrait analysis of the cosmological models relying on the gurzadyan - xue type dark energy formula as mentioned above .",
    "a novel interpretation of the physical nature of dark energy and description of an internally consistent solution for the behavior of dark energy as a function of redshift are provided by djorgovski and gurzadyan@xcite based on the vacuum fluctuations model by gurzadyan and xue@xcite .",
    "the conservation equation for variable @xmath0 and constant @xmath6 is a byproduct of the generalized conservation law and is given by @xmath23 let us consider a relationship between the pressure and density of the physical system in the form of the following barotropic equation of state @xmath24 where @xmath2 is the barotropic index which has been considered here as time - dependent .    using equation ( 6 ) we get from ( 5 ) @xmath25    differentiating ( 3 ) with respect to @xmath26 we get for a flat universe ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28    as already mentioned in the introductory part , equivalence of three phenomenological @xmath0-models ( viz .",
    ", @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) have been studied in detail .",
    "so , similar type of variable-@xmath0 model may be investigated for a deeper understanding of both the accelerating and decelerating phases of the universe .",
    "let us , therefore , use the _ ansatz _ , @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a proportional constant .",
    "using equations ( 6 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) we get from ( 4 ) @xmath35    if we put @xmath36 , then equation ( 10 ) reduces to @xmath37    to arrive at fruitful conclusions , let us now solve equation ( 11 ) under some specific assumptions .",
    "@xmath38 implies via equation ( 9 ) , @xmath39 . in this case equation",
    "( 11 ) reduces to @xmath40 solving equation ( 12 ) for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 we get @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "it may be mentioned here that the above expressions for @xmath41 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 can be recovered from the corresponding expressions of ray et al.@xcite for @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a parameter for the model @xmath51 considered there .",
    "this means that the results ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) can be obtained either for constant @xmath0 ( as in the present case ) or for null @xmath0 as in the case of ray et al.@xcite .",
    "the essence of this is that , a null @xmath0 or constant @xmath0 will provide equivalent result .",
    "it may also be mentioned here that by abandoning @xmath0 , einstein obtained the expanding universe while the same expanding universe was obtained by de sitter for constant @xmath0 .    again , using equation ( 14 ) we can find the expression for the deceleration parameter @xmath3 as @xmath52    from equation ( 16 ) we find that for an accelerating universe , @xmath53 .",
    "but , from equation ( 13)-(15 ) it is clear that @xmath2 can not be equal to @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the present value of @xmath3 lies near @xmath54@xcite which can be obtained from equation ( 16 ) by putting a value of @xmath2 which is equal to @xmath55 .",
    "the sought for signature flipping of @xmath3 can be obtained from equation ( 16 ) if one considers @xmath2 as time - dependent .",
    "if @xmath56 and @xmath57 be the present values of @xmath21 and @xmath26 , then from equation ( 14 ) we can write , @xmath58    putting @xmath59 in equation ( 17 ) and assuming @xmath60 kms@xmath61mpc@xmath61 we find that the present age of the universe comes out as @xmath62 gyr . which fits very well within the ranges provided by various sources ( for a list of data provided by various sources one may consult ray et al .",
    "@xcite . in this context",
    "it may be mentioned that for stiff - fluid ( @xmath63 ) ray et al.@xcite obtained the present age of the universe as @xmath64 gyr . under the ansatz @xmath65 .      by the use of the above substitution eq . ( 11 ) becomes @xmath67    solving equation ( 18 ) we get @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath71 @xmath72\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is a constant and @xmath74 .    for physically valid @xmath21 ,  @xmath75 .",
    "( 23 ) implies that for a positive @xmath76 , @xmath2 must be less than @xmath13 as in the case of phantom energy . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath77 , then @xmath2 can be greater than @xmath13 as well .",
    "similar type of trigonometric solutions have been obtained by mukhopadhyay and ray@xcite for polytropic equation of state with constant @xmath2 in non - dust case under the _ ansatz _ @xmath30 .",
    "simple trigonometric solution for the scale factor was also obtained by banerjee and das@xcite in scalar field model .",
    "but , they obtained their solution by making a special assumption on the deceleration parameter while the present solution is a result of a supposition on the equation of state parameter @xmath2 .",
    "again , using equation ( 20 ) we get @xmath78.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from equation ( 24 ) we find that , a signature flipping of @xmath3 is possible if @xmath77 .",
    "so , the merit of this case lies the fact that the same change of sign of @xmath3 can be obtained here by using a time - dependent form of @xmath2 and not making any special assumption on @xmath3 directly as was done by banerjee and das@xcite .",
    "this once again shows that the equation of state parameter is a key ingredient of cosmic evolution .      with the above assumption , eq . ( 11 ) becomes @xmath80 solving equation ( 25 ) we get our solution set as @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an integration constant .",
    "thus , we find that in this case the scale factor admits a power law solution , @xmath21 varies inversely as @xmath26 and @xmath19 as well as @xmath0 follow the well known inverse square law with @xmath26 .",
    "this type of solution was obtained by ray et al.@xcite for @xmath87 , @xmath30 and @xmath88 models . for physical validity @xmath89 . but , in this case @xmath90 for real @xmath34 and hence represents an attractive force .",
    "however , @xmath0 can be a repulsive force as well if @xmath34 is a complex number .",
    "now , a complex @xmath34 means a complex scale factor .",
    "so , this particular case can be thought of as a phenomenological version of spintessence model of banerjee and das@xcite where a complex scalar field of the form @xmath91 is used to search for the cosmic acceleration .",
    "but , in that case @xmath2 is a constant .",
    "also , for @xmath92 if we take the present value of the hubble parameter as @xmath60 kms@xmath61mpc@xmath61 then , from equation ( 27 ) the present age of the universe comes out as @xmath62 gyr . which agrees very well with the estimated value@xcite .",
    "now , for @xmath92 we have @xmath93 and the scale factor grows linearly with time .",
    "again , in this case @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( 31 ) shows that for a positive @xmath34 , the universe expands with a constant acceleration . for @xmath92",
    "the amount of acceleration is @xmath95 .",
    "so , in this case of the phenomenological model @xmath7 , the deceleration parameter @xmath3 does not show any change in sign during cosmic evolution .",
    "the main objectives of the present work were to search for a signature flip of @xmath3 and to find time - dependent expression for the equation of state parameter . in that respect , this work in general has fulfilled its goal . by selecting a time dependent form of the cosmological parameter @xmath0 , through some analytical study , it has been possible to show that a change in sign of the deceleration parameter can be achieved under some special assumptions ( sec .",
    "it has also been possible to derive time dependent expressions for the equation of state parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is found that @xmath2 can be less than @xmath13 as well which is compatible with sn ia data@xcite and sn ia data with cmb anisotropy and galaxy - cluster statistics@xcite .",
    "it would be worthwhile to mention here that in the present work the parameter @xmath34 plays a vital role for studying the cosmic evolution of various phases of the universe .",
    "for instance , a null @xmath34 presents us a case of constant @xmath0 ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) whereas positive and negative @xmath34 show the possibility of @xmath96 ( phantom energy ) or @xmath97 respectively ( sec .",
    "the well deserved signature flipping of @xmath3 is also possible for @xmath98 ( sec . 3.2 ) .",
    "a possibility of a complex @xmath34 is provided in sec .",
    "3.3 which has similarity with the work of banerjee and das@xcite . for a specific value of @xmath34 the age of the universe and the value of @xmath3",
    "are calculated also ( sec .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar type of case study for the cosmic evolution has been done by khachatryan@xcite using a parameter @xmath99 for null , positive and negative values of it .",
    "so , whether there exists any internal physical relationship between the present work and that of khachatryan@xcite may be a subject matter of future investigation .",
    "determination of the present value of the hubble parameter through analysis of cmb data from wmap and hst key project suggests that value of the equation of state parameter for dark energy models should be less than @xmath54 at the @xmath100 confidence level@xcite .",
    "so , in some cases a big rip may not be impossible .",
    "for @xmath0-cdm models , the statefinder diagnostic satisfies the condition @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102 can be expressed in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , so it is easy to verify that first ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) and third ( sec .",
    "3.3 ) cases satisfy the above condition prescribed by the statefinder diagnostic for @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath0-cdm universe with @xmath107 , where the sine hyperbolic form of the scale factor can reflect both matter dominated past and accelerated expansion in future@xcite , can not be achieved through this model .",
    "equation ( 11 ) shows that for @xmath107 , @xmath21 grows linearly with time which does not fit with the present cosmological scenario .",
    "however , through the present model , it has been possible to provide some interesting situations which were obtained earlier by different researchers and are already discussed in respective sections .",
    "some awkward cases , such as constant energy density ( which can be obtained by putting @xmath108 in equation ( 11 ) ) can be found in the work of ray@xcite in relation to electromagnetic mass in @xmath109 dimensional space - time .",
    "some other works@xcite also admit constant matter distribution in their solutions .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the present work is done making @xmath0 variable and keeping @xmath6 constant .",
    "so , it may be an interesting study when the present model is combined with a variable @xmath6 and obey the generalized energy conservation law derived by shapiro et al.@xcite and vereshchagin and yegorian@xcite .",
    "that can be a subject matter of our future investigation .",
