    "globally coupled dynamical systems form an important class of models in nonlinear dynamics . the all - to - all nature of the coupling may be regarded as an idealization of long - range coupling or an approximation to a short - range coupling high - dimensional lattice .",
    "such systems are useful in modeling diverse phenomena such as josephson junction arrays@xcite , multimode laser@xcite , charge - density wave@xcite , evolutionary dynamics@xcite , biological information processing and neurodynamics@xcite .",
    "a simplifying assumption is often made that the coupling strength is uniform over all coupled pairs .",
    "this makes the theoretical treatment much easier compared with systems with short - range interaction@xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study globally coupled maps ( gcm ) introduced by kaneko @xcite .",
    "they form a dynamical system of @xmath0 local mappings which are under a common internal field .",
    "the system is thus a mean - field version of coupled map lattices ( cml ) @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of gcm we will work with is given by @xmath1 here @xmath2 represents a discrete time step , @xmath3 the index of the elements ( @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 the coupling constant .",
    "it is assumed that the map @xmath6 gives rise to chaotic dynamics .",
    "we specifically consider a tent map @xmath7 with parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the piesewise linearity of the map simplifies the analysis considerably as we see later .",
    "the range of @xmath9 of each map is given by @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the coupling is only through the mean field @xmath11 there are a great variety of phenomena generated by such globally coupled maps , and they seem to be due to two conflicting natures involved in the dynamics @xcite . on one side , the presence of a common driving force coming from the mean field favors mutual synchronization . on the other side , unstable growth of the difference in @xmath12 between any pair of elements",
    "tends to destroy such synchrony .",
    "if the coupling constant @xmath5 is sufficiently large , mutual synchronization will be complete , all elements behaving identically .",
    "then the collective motion is described simply by the single map @xmath6 . on the contrary , if @xmath5 is sufficiently small , the system will be `` turbulent '' where the elements are scattered and behave chaotically in time . in the present model there also appear band structures for intermediate coupling strengths .",
    "the state of perfect coherence loses stability at @xmath13 , while the transition between turbulent and two - band states occurs at @xmath14 .",
    "a phase diagram was obtained by kaneko@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall confine our analysis to turbulent and two - band states .",
    "the limit of large @xmath0 is of our particular concern .",
    "some unexpected features of collective quantities such as the mean field have been found recently .",
    "for instance , the mean square deviation of such quantities dose not tend to zero as @xmath15 but saturates to a finite value .",
    "this suggests the existence of nontrivial collective behavior @xcite .",
    "for a very large system size , direct numerical simulation of ( [ maps - defn ] ) requires enormous computer capacity .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of long transients may complicate the analysis of stationary states and other asymptotic states .",
    "for these reasons , an alternative approach seems desirable .",
    "statistical states of an ensemble of maps governed by ( [ maps - defn ] ) can be characterized by its density distribution @xmath16 where @xmath17 is dirac s delta function .",
    "the evolution of @xmath18 obeys the frobenius - perron equation @xcite @xmath19 where the effective map @xmath20 depends on the mean field @xmath21 through @xmath22 the mean field @xmath21 is calculated from the density ( [ density ] ) as @xmath23 equation ( [ nfpe - int ] ) is called the nonlinear frobenius - perron equation ( nfpe ) @xcite . in the limit of large system size the density ( [ density ] ) becomes a `` sufficient continuous '' function .",
    "nfpe is completely analogous to the nonlinear fokker - planck equation . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the initial condition is given by a uniform distribution @xmath24 , that is , the elements of the original gcm are distributed in a completely random fashion .",
    "owing to the linearity of the two branches of the tent maps , ( [ nfpe - int ] ) is simplified as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the two preimages of the same @xmath9 , i.e.@xmath28 .    in the following ,",
    "we propose an expansion form of nfpe in order to facilitate the analysis of the model .",
    "figure [ fig : density ] shows snapshots of @xmath18 for two parameter conditions .",
    "the density distributions for a turbulent state and a two - band state are displayed in figs.[fig : density]a and [ fig : density]b , respectively .",
    "we assume that the density distribution is a piecewise constant function , which is due to the piecewise linearity of the tent map .",
    "then , one may simplify ( [ nfpe ] ) by using a technique adopted to analyze a one - dimensional tent map @xcite .",
    "the density distribution is expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a step function @xmath31 in the above equation , @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the height and the location of the jumps in @xmath18 , respectively . since the initial condition for the density distribution is assumed uniform , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by @xmath36 for @xmath37 , the number of jumps in the density @xmath18 , which is denoted by @xmath38 , equals two , and increases with @xmath2 as @xmath39 . with the use of ( [ nfpe ] ) ,",
    "the evolutional equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by @xmath40 this set of equations gives an alternative representation of nfpe ( [ nfpe ] ) .",
    "note the identity @xmath41 which results from the requirement @xmath42 . by using ( [ density ] )",
    "along with ( [ rho ] ) , the mean field @xmath21 is calculated as @xmath43 equations ( [ f ] ) , ( [ expansion1 ] ) and ( [ expansion2 ] ) constitute a closed set of exact nonlinear equations equivalent to nfpe , and ( [ init ] ) specifies the initial condition .",
    "the dimension of the dynamical system ( [ expansion1 ] ) is potentially infinite ( @xmath44 ) because the number of jumps in @xmath18 increases indefinitely with @xmath2 .",
    "we now approximate this by a finite number .",
    "we expect that the jumps of sufficiently large @xmath45 hardly contribute to the collective behavior , so that we may ignore such minor jumps .",
    "indeed , the third equation in ( [ expansion1 ] ) means that the height of the jumps is given by @xmath46 thus , @xmath32 approaches 0 exponentially as @xmath47 , provided @xmath48 .",
    "we now focus on this incoherent regime .",
    "note that in the opposite case , i.e.  @xmath49 , @xmath18 becomes a delta function since all elements are in perfect synchrony , so that the breakdown of the above approximation is apparent .",
    "our approximate method seems more convenient than those employed previously @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we restrict the maximum number of the jumps to 50 @xcite .",
    "the mean field behavior calculated with this approximation turns out consistent with our direct numerical simulation .",
    "we investigate stationary solutions i.e.  fixed points of nfpe which are however not the fixed points of gcm ( [ maps - defn ] ) .",
    "the fixed points of nfpe are determined by @xmath50 . from the expansion ( [ expansion1 ] ) in the last section , this condition",
    "is given by @xmath51 where the map @xmath52 evaluated at the fixed point @xmath53 is given as @xmath54 the above equations constitute a set of self - consistent equations . for the time - being ,",
    "we regard @xmath55 in ( [ f2 ] ) as an input field @xmath56 , and distinguish it from @xmath55 in ( [ fixed2 ] ) which we regard as an output field @xmath57 .",
    "we can easily calculate @xmath58 and @xmath59 from ( [ fixed ] ) and the normalization condition for the density @xmath60 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 thus obtained , the static field @xmath57 is given by ( [ fixed2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath57 is obtained as a function of @xmath56 , i.e.@xmath61 , which is called a `` static mapping '' @xcite .",
    "the fixed points of this mapping give the stationary solutions of our system .",
    "the mapping actually has some fixed points in most of the parameter region under consideration .    numerical stability analysis of the stationary states is now presented .",
    "we first linearize ( [ expansion1 ] ) about a stationary state ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) corresponding to the density @xmath62 , and consider a small density deviation from it . noting that @xmath20 in ( [ expansion1 ] ) depends on @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we have a set of linear maps given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the set of equations above can be expressed with a coefficient matrix @xmath66 as @xmath67 the eigenvalues of @xmath66 determines the stability of the stationary solution .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ matrix ] ) that @xmath66 has the form @xmath68 thus , the eigenvalues of @xmath66 are given by those of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and they are generally complex numbers . in fig.[fig : eigen0 ] , we show the eigenvalues of @xmath66 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for which a stationary state exists stably .",
    "they include real numbers and complex - conjugate pairs , and their distribution is roughly given by two concentric circles .",
    "the inner and outer circles correspond to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the normalization condition for @xmath18 requires that one of the eigenvalues is always unity @xcite .",
    "if all of the remaining eigenvalues lie within the unit circle , the stationary solution remains stable .",
    "it loses stability in the following two ways .",
    "the first case is due to band splitting .",
    "this occurs at @xmath73 @xcite . in the unstable region ,",
    "period - two motion appears , and then the density @xmath18 has a two - band structure as shown in fig.[fig : density]b . an infinite number of period - two solutions exist and a particular state is selected out by imposing a specific initial condition . therefore , it is expected that their stability is marginal .",
    "figure [ fig : eigen]a shows the eigenvalues under the condition that stationary state is stable ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the moduli of all eigenvalues except for one with vanishing argument are smaller than unity .",
    "figure [ fig : eigen]b shows the eigenvalues after band splitting ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath69 has two eigenvalues with moduli 1 , while their arguments are given by to @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( the eigenvalues are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively ) . in fig.[fig : eigen2 ] , we plotted the eigenvalue @xmath80 with argument @xmath77 as a function of @xmath5 . as is seen from fig.[fig : eigen2]a , @xmath81 approaches unity as @xmath5 increases up to the band - splitting point @xmath82 under fixed @xmath8 at @xmath83 . for this value of @xmath8",
    ", the band splitting is seen for @xmath84 , and @xmath81 is kept at unity over this range of @xmath5 .",
    "the results of the stability analysis agree with our observation from direct numerical simulation . in order to investigate the nature of this instability in some detail",
    ", we make a log - log plot near the band - splitting point .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : eigen2]b . as is seen from fig.[fig : eigen2]b , @xmath81 approaches unity linearly with @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the band - splitting point can be determined accurately from this kind of analysis .",
    "there is another type of instability .",
    "this is associated with a hopf bifurcation , and occurs even in the region where the band splitting is not seen ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : eigen]c shows the distribution of the eigenvalues in the unstable regime .",
    "@xmath81 is smaller than unity and the matrix @xmath70 has an eigenvalue with modulus larger than unity .",
    "the argument of this eigenvalue is about @xmath86 . in this region ,",
    "the collective behavior of the original system is found quasiperiodic .",
    "the evolution of the corresponding mean field @xmath21 is displayed in fig.[fig : h ] , and its power spectrum is given in fig.[fig : power ] .",
    "the latter has some sharp peaks , and the frequency of the highest peak is about @xmath87 .",
    "this value is consistent with the results of our stability analysis .",
    "the piecewise - linearity of the map allows us to make an expansion of nfpe in term of the height and location of the jumps in the density distribution .",
    "we analyzed the stability of stationary solutions by using this expansion .",
    "linearization of the expansion is expressed with two matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the band - splitting instability is associated with the eigenvalues of @xmath69 .",
    "stability analysis predicts the band - splitting point accurately .",
    "the band splitting results in marginally stable period - two states .",
    "there is also a region where quasi - periodic motions appear .",
    "the corresponding instability is essentially a hopf bifurcation , and associated with the eigenvalues of @xmath70 .",
    "higher order band splitting is also seen . at the critical parameter values @xmath90 , @xmath91-band structure appears .",
    "the period of this state is @xmath91 .",
    "if the population in some bands is zero , the number of bands can be smaller than @xmath91 ."
