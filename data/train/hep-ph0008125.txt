    "<S> the loop induced coupling of an intermediate mass higgs boson to two photons is a sensitive and unique measure for precision tests of physics beyond the standard model . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we summarize recent results on the expected precision of the partial @xmath0 width at the @xmath1 option of a future linear collider . </S>",
    "<S> heavy particles do not decouple in general and differences between the sm and mssm predictions or 2hd - models can differ in the percentile regime . </S>",
    "<S> large non - sudakov dl corrections need to be resummed and consistency requirements demand the use of the sterman - weinberg jet definition in order to avoid additional dl terms from three jet final states . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the well understood background process @xmath2 allows for a @xmath3(2% ) determination of @xmath0 using conservative collider parameters . </S>",
    "<S> recent improvements in the expected @xmath1 luminosity suggest that the precision for the diphoton partial higgs width can be further improved and is dominated by the error in br(@xmath4 ) from the @xmath5 mode , which is presently estimated to be in the one percent regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the partial diphoton higgs width @xmath6 , measured at the @xmath1 compton - backscattered option of a future linear @xmath5 collider , is a very important physical quantity @xcite . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was found that the mssm and sm predictions can differ in the percentile regime for large masses of the pseudoscalar higgs @xmath7 , depending mainly on the chargino - masses . </S>",
    "<S> the sm with two higgs doublets ( 2hdm ) and all other higgs particles heavy differs by about 10% @xcite . at the plc one </S>",
    "<S> measures the product @xmath8 and it is assumed that the branching ratio can be measured in the @xmath5 mode via @xmath9 } { \\sigma ( zh)}$ ] with a 1 % accuracy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently demonstrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that using conservative assumptions an accuracy of 2% is feasible for the diphoton partial width at a plc . there has been considerable progress in the theoretical understanding of the bg to the intermediate mass higgs boson decay into @xmath10 recently . </S>",
    "<S> the born cross section for the @xmath11 channel is suppressed by @xmath12 relative to the @xmath13 which means that by ensuring a high degree of polarization of the incident photons one can _ simultaneously _ enhance the signal and suppress the background . </S>",
    "<S> qcd radiative corrections can remove this suppression , however , and large bremsstrahlung and double logarithmic corrections need to be taken into account . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the exact one loop corrections to @xmath14 were calculated and the largest virtual correction was contained in novel non - sudakov double logarithms . </S>",
    "<S> for some choices of the invariant mass cutoff @xmath15 even a negative cross section was obtained in this approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite elucidated the physical nature of the novel double logarithms and performed a two loop calculation in the dl - approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the results restored positivity to the physical cross section . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , three loop dl - results were presented which revealed a factorization of sudakov and non - sudakov dl s and led to the all orders resummation of all dl in form of a confluent hypergeometric function @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the general form of the expression is @xmath17 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was demonstrated that at least four loops on the cross section level are required to achieve a converged dl result . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the scale of the qcd - coupling is still unrestrained and differs by more than a factor of two in - between the physical scales of the problem , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty was removed in ref . @xcite by introducing a running coupling @xmath20 into each loop integration , where @xmath21 denotes the perpendicular sudakov loop momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the rg - improvement lead to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective scale , defined simply as the one used in the dl - approximation which gives a result close to the rg - improved values , depends on @xmath23 , however in general is rather much closer to @xmath18 than @xmath19 @xcite . on the signal side </S>",
    "<S> , the relevant radiative corrections have long been known up to nnl order in the sm @xcite and are summarized including the mssm predictions in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for our purposes the one loop corrections to the diphoton partial width are sufficient as the qcd corrections are small in the sm . the important point to make here and also </S>",
    "<S> the novel feature in this analysis is that the branching ratio br ( @xmath24 ) is corrected by the same rg - improved resummed qcd sudakov form as the continuum heavy quark background @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessary in order to employ the same two jet definition for the final state . </S>",
    "<S> since we use the renormalization group improved massive sudakov form factor @xmath25 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we prefer the sterman - weinberg jet definition @xcite schematically depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jet ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is also necessitated by the fact that for three jet - topologies new dl corrections would enter which are not included in the background resummation of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also use an all orders resummed running quark mass evaluated at the higgs mass for @xmath26 . for the total higgs width , we include the partial higgs to @xmath27 and @xmath28 decay widths with all relevant radiative corrections .    we begin with a few generic remarks concerning the uncertainties in our predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the signal process @xmath29 is well understood and nnl calculations are available . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical error is thus negligible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two contributions to the background process @xmath30 which we neglect in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the so - called resolved photon contribution was found to be a small effect , e.g. @xcite , especially since we want to reconstruct the higgs mass from the final two - jet measurements and impose angular cuts in the forward region . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the good charm suppression also helps to suppress the resolved photon effects as they give the largest contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the second contribution we do not consider here results from the final state configuration where a soft quark is propagating down the beam pipe and the gluon and remaining quark form two hard back - to back - jets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect this contribution here due to the expected excellent double b - tagging efficiency and the strong restrictions on the allowed acollinearity discussed below . a good measure of the remaining theoretical uncertainty in the continuum background is given by scanning it below and above the higgs resonance . for precision extractions of @xmath31 the exact functional form for resonant energies </S>",
    "<S> is still required , though . in terms of possible systematic errors , </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious effect comes from the theoretical uncertainty in the bottom mass determination . </S>",
    "<S> recent qcd - sum rule analyses , however , reach below the 2% level for @xmath32 @xcite including the effect of a massive charm @xcite . for quantitative estimates of expected systematic experimental errors </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly too early to speculate at this point . </S>",
    "<S> the philosophy adopted henceforth is that we assume that they can be neglected at the 1% level and concentrate purely on the statistical error . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here not on specific predictions for cross sections , but instead on the expected statistical accuracy of the intermediate mass higgs signal at a plc . as detailed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , due to the narrow higgs width , the signal event rate is proportional to @xmath33 , while the bg is proportional to @xmath34 . to quantify this , we take the design parameters of the proposed tesla linear collider @xcite , which correspond to an integrated peak @xmath1-luminosity of 15 fb@xmath35 for the low energy running of the compton collider . </S>",
    "<S> the polarizations of the incident electron beams and the laser photons are chosen such that the product of the helicities @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures high monochromaticity and polarization of the photon beams @xcite . within this scenario </S>",
    "<S> a typical resolution of the higgs mass is about 10  gev , so that for comparison with the background process @xmath37 one can use @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath390.5 fb@xmath35/gev . the number of background events is then given by @xmath40 .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was demonstrated that in order to achieve a large enough data sample , a central thrust angle cut @xmath41 is advantageous and is adopted here . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume a ( realistic ) 70% double b - tagging efficiency . for the charm rejection rate </S>",
    "<S> , however , it seems now possible to assume an even better detector performance . </S>",
    "<S> the improvement comes from assuming a better single point resolution , thinner detector modules and moving the vertex detectors closer to the beam - line @xcite . with these results in hand we keep @xmath41 fixed and </S>",
    "<S> furthermore assume the @xmath42 misidentification rate of 1% @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we vary the cone angle @xmath43 between narrow ( @xmath44 ) , medium ( @xmath45 ) and large ( @xmath46 ) cone sizes for both @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper row of fig . [ fig : ssig ] demonstrates that for the former choice of the energy cutoff parameter we achieve the highest statistical accuracy for the large @xmath49 scenario of around 2% . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize , however , that in this case also the missing @xmath50 bremsstrahlung corrections could become important . </S>",
    "<S> the largest effect is obtained by effectively suppressing the background radiative events with the smaller energy cutoff of @xmath48 outside the cone ( the inside is of course independent of @xmath23 ) . here the lower row of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ssig ] demonstrates that the statistical accuracy of the higgs boson with @xmath51 gev can be below the 2% level after collecting one year of data . </S>",
    "<S> we should mention again that for this choice of @xmath23 we might have slightly enhanced the higher order ( uncanceled ) cutoff dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the photon - photon polarization degree is visible but not crucial . </S>",
    "<S> we also conclude that the good charm misidentification rate is important for @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> together with the expected uncertainty of 1% from the @xmath53 mode determination of br@xmath54 , we conclude that a measurement of the partial width @xmath55 of 2% precision level is feasible for the mssm mass range from a purely statistical point of view . with the aforementioned possible luminosity increase by a factor of 15 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this number could come down by a factor of two and would be dominated by the error on br@xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this level of accuracy could significantly enhance the kinematical reach of the mssm parameter space in the large pseudoscalar mass limit and thus open up a window for physics beyond the standard model . in summary , using realistic and optimized machine and detector design parameters , we conclude that the compton collider option at a future linear collider can considerably extend our ability to discriminate between the sm and mssm or 2hdm scenarios . </S>"
