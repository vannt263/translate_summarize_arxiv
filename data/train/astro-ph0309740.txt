    "pulsars release their rotational kinetic energy via relativistic winds , with `` spin - down luminosities '' typically in the range @xmath1  ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "pulsars also have high space velocities , typically @xmath3  , meaning that they are almost always moving supersonically through surrounding gas .",
    "we can therefore conclude that most pulsars drive bow shocks in the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "pulsar bow shocks are potentially a very powerful probe of interstellar gas .",
    "the precision of pulsar timing means that we usually have very accurate measurements of a pulsar s @xmath4 , its position , its proper motion , and its distance ( via either parallax or the dispersion of the pulses ) .",
    "thus in a pulsar bow shock , the only remaining unknowns are the density / structure of the ism , plus the inclination of the pulsar s velocity vector to the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , pulsars typically have ages of @xmath5  years , so that they are usually well - removed from star - forming regions and are thus a relatively unbiased tracer of the ism .",
    "the pulsar / ism interaction generates two shocks , a forward shock ( the bow shock ) and a reverse shock ( the pulsar wind termination shock ) , separated by a contact discontinuity .",
    "the fundamental size scale of the system is the distance along the symmetry axis between the pulsar and the contact discontinuity .",
    "this `` stand - off distance '' , @xmath6 , is set by ram - pressure balance : @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 is the solid angle of the outflow in the pulsar wind , and @xmath9 is the ambient density .",
    "the shape of the bow shock surface has an analytic solution , as shown by [ 1 ] .",
    "we observe two distinct types of emission from bow shocks .",
    "the forward shock is often seen in h@xmath10 , resulting from collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen , plus charge exchange with protons behind the shock .",
    "we also see radio / x - ray synchrotron emission , produced by relativistic particles accelerated at the termination shock . only around psr  b1957 + 20 ( fig  [ fig ] , left ) have we as yet seen both h@xmath10 and synchrotron emission in the same source [ 2 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath6 can be directly estimated from an image of a bow shock . if we assume that @xmath11 , and derive @xmath4 and @xmath12 from pulsar timing and dispersion , we can use pressure balance to determine @xmath9 .",
    "this calculation is complicated by the unknown inclination angle and other effects , but overall , it can be shown that the known bow shocks are all consistent with ambient densities @xmath13  @xmath14 , as expected for the warm neutral ism [ 3 ] .",
    "the morphology of the bow shock powered by psr  j04374715 is well described by the idealised form derived by [ 1 ] , allowing one to derive the inclination angle of the pulsar s velocity vector to the line of sight [ 4 ] .",
    "however , the recently discovered bow shocks around psrs j2124358 [ 5 ] and b074028 [ 6 ] show asymmetries , kinks and other features in their h@xmath10 emission ( fig  [ fig ] , centre & right ) . these deviations from the analytic solution can be used to infer the presence of a density gradient and/or relative flow velocity in the ambient ism [ 5 , 7 ] .",
    "a pulsar moving at 500  at a distance of 1  kpc has a proper motion of 100  mas  year@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting bow shock motion is easily detectable in a few years with modern optical facilities .",
    "for example , if a pulsar is moving into a region of increasing density , one expects the head to narrow and the stand - off distance to shrink .",
    "this is indeed what has been observed in the `` guitar nebula '' powered by psr  b2224 + 65 , between two epochs separated by 7 years [ 3 ] .",
    "such changes suggest fluctuations at the level of @xmath15  @xmath14 on scales @xmath16  pc .",
    "further such measurements of density variations may may provide a useful `` missing link '' between the density fluctuations seen in  at scales @xmath17  pc ( e.g.  [ 8 ] ) and the `` tiny scale atomic structure '' at scales @xmath185100  au seen toward pulsars and through vlbi ( e.g. ) .",
    "we are now planning a number of further avenues of investigation : multi - epoch imaging to better characterise the time - variability of these sources ; deep spectroscopy to identify high - velocity h@xmath10 emission and thus probe the post - shock flow ; modelling of variations in brightness and thickness seen around the shock ; searching for uv lines from bow shocks to probe pulsars embedded in ionised gas ; modelling of x - ray and radio data from shocked pulsar winds ; and deeper optical searches with magellan to increase the sample beyond the six optical bow shocks currently known .",
    "it is important to realise that the number of promising targets to search is rapidly increasing  the number of known pulsars has doubled in the last five years , and probably will do so again in another five years . while we are only just beginning to explore their potential , all these considerations argue that pulsar bow shocks are emerging as an exciting new probe of the ism .",
