    "recently , the study of unstable nuclei is one of the hot subjects . in the light unstable nuclei ,",
    "the experimental informations near the drip lines increase rapidly and many interesting phenomena are found .",
    "the exotic structures such as the halo , the skin structures , and the clustering structures are suggested in some light unstable nuclei .",
    "are the features of the clusters in unstable nuclei similar to those in the stable nuclei ?",
    "the shift of the magic number and the deformations of unstable nuclei are the concerned problems .",
    "our aim is to research on the excited states of unstable and to study systematically the various structures of unstable nuclei .",
    "we apply a theoretical method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) .",
    "the method of variation after projection(vap ) in the framework of amd has been already proved to be useful to investigate the excited states of light unstable nuclei @xcite as well as stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "amd is a powerful approach which is applicable to the excited states of general nuclei .",
    "the wave function of amd can represent various clustering structures as well as shell - model - like structures , because there is no inert core in the framework .    in the previous study on the excited states of @xmath1be with amd @xcite",
    ", we found that the molecule - like structures may coexist in the low - energy region with the ordinary shell - model - like states .",
    "the data of the transitions such as @xmath2 and gamow - teller transitions are so helpful to classify the excited levels into rotational bands .",
    "the reader is referred to the paper @xcite for the detailed discussions .",
    "in this section we explain the formulation of amd for the study of the nuclear structure of the excited states .      the wave function of a system is written by amd wave functions , @xmath3 an amd wavefunction of a nucleus with mass number",
    "@xmath4 is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets ; @xmath5,\\\\ \\chi_{\\xi_i}= \\left(\\begin{array}{l } { 1\\over 2}+\\xi_{i}\\\\ { 1\\over 2}-\\xi_{i } \\end{array}\\right ) , \\end{array}\\right . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath6th single - particle wave function @xmath7 is a product of the spatial wave function , the intrinsic spin function and the iso - spin function .",
    "the spatial part @xmath8 is presented by complex parameters @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , of the centers of gaussians , and @xmath12 is the intrinsic spin function parameterized by @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the iso - spin function which is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) in the present calculations .",
    "thus an amd wave function is parameterized by a set of complex parameters @xmath15 which determine the centers of gaussians of the spatial parts and the directions of the intrinsic spins for all single - particle wave functions .",
    "if we consider a spin - parity eigen state projected from a amd wave function , the total wave function is linear combinations of slater determinants , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a parity projection operator .",
    "the integrations for the euler angles are numerically calculated by a summation of mesh points on @xmath18 .    in principal",
    "the total wave function can be a superposition of independent amd wave functions , @xmath19      we make variational calculations to find the state which minimizes the energy of the system ; @xmath20 by the method of frictional cooling @xcite , one of the imaginary time methods .",
    "the time development of the wave function @xmath21 is given by the equations , @xmath22 @xmath23 with arbitrary real numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is easily proved that the energy of the system decreases with time . after sufficient time steps of cooling",
    ", we obtain the optimum parameters for the minimum - energy state .      in order to obtain the wave function for the lowest @xmath26 state , we perform the energy variation for the spin parity eigenstates projected from an amd wave function . in this case",
    "the trial function is @xmath27 . for the preparation of vap calculations ,",
    "first we make variational calculations before the spin projection in order to choose an initial wave function for each parity and an appropriate @xmath28 quantum for each spin - parity state . then we perform vap calculation for @xmath29 with the adopted @xmath28 quantum from the initial state . in the vap procedure , the @xmath30-axis of euler angle in the total - angular momentum projection",
    "is not necessarily same as the principal @xmath31-axis .",
    "the direction of the intrinsic deformation in the body - fixed frame is automatically determined in the energy variation depending on the adopted @xmath28 quantum . however , in many cases , the approximately principal axis @xmath31 obtained by a vap calculation is found to be almost equal to the @xmath30-axis .      as mentioned above , with the vap calculation for @xmath32",
    ", we obtain the set of parameters @xmath33 which presents the wave function for the first @xmath26 state . to search the parameters @xmath34 for the higher excited @xmath26 states",
    ", we make the energy variation for the orthogonal component of a spin - parity projected amd wave function to the lower states by superposing the wave functions .",
    "if the amd wave functions for the higher excited states have energetically local minimums , we do not need orthogonalization in vap calculations .",
    "after vap calculations for various @xmath35 states , we obtain many intrinsic states @xmath36 , @xmath37,@xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "finally we improve the wave functions by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix @xmath40 ) for all the intrinsic states and ( @xmath41 ) . in comparison with the experimental data ,",
    "the theoretical values are calculated with the final states after the diagonalization .",
    "we calculate the excited states of @xmath42be and @xmath43be .",
    "the adopted interactions are the mv1 case3 ( the finite two - body and the zero - range three - body interactions @xcite ) for the central force , and g3rs for the spin - orbit force @xcite . the coulomb interaction is approximated by a sum of seven gaussians . in the present calculations ,",
    "we adopt the majorana parameter @xmath44 and omit the bartlett and heisenberg terms in the two - body central force . as for the strength of the spin - orbit force , we try two cases of the parameter , @xmath45=3700 mev and @xmath45=2500 mev .",
    "the resonance states are treated as a bound - state approximation in amd , because the restriction of the gaussian forms of the wave functions makes an artificial barrier for outgoing particles .",
    "the energy levels of @xmath42be are displayed in figure [ fig : be12spe ] .",
    "the theoretical results are calculated with the stronger spin - orbit force as @xmath46 mev which can reproduce the abnormal parity of the ground @xmath47 state in @xmath43be .",
    "many excited states are seen in the low - energy region .",
    "even though the @xmath42be has the neutron magic number 8 , it is surprising that the calculated ground state is not the ordinary state with the neutron closed @xmath48-shell , but a 2 particle 2 hole state with the developed clustering structure . as the evidence of the breaking of the closed @xmath48-shell ,",
    "the calculations reproduce well the small value of the gamow - teller(gt ) transition strength from @xmath42be(@xmath49 ) to @xmath42b(@xmath50 ) .",
    "the experimental @xmath51 is about one third as small as the value expected for the closed @xmath48-shell @xmath42be(@xmath49 ) . in other words ,",
    "the weak gt transition is one of the proofs for the disappearance of the neutron magic number 8 in neutron - rich be isotopes .",
    "it is consistent with the shell model analysis by t. suzuki et al .",
    "we also find many excited states with the developed molecule - like structures which construct the rotational bands @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the low - energy region .",
    "since the ground state has the large deformation in the present calculations , the predicted @xmath55 in the ground band is 14 e@xmath56@xmath57 and is much larger than the value 7 e@xmath56@xmath57 of @xmath58 in the second @xmath59 band which consists of the closed @xmath48-shell states .",
    "= 12 cm      in this subsection , we discuss the excited states of @xmath43be . in fig",
    "[ fig : be11spe ] , the calculated energy levels are shown with the experimental data .",
    "we use the rather strong spin - orbit force in case ( 1 ) and the weaker ls force in case ( 2 ) .",
    "the binding energies are underestimated as 58 mev in case ( 1 ) and as 54 mev in case ( 2 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to fit to the experimental binding energy by choosing a smaller value for the majorana parameter .    in the case",
    "( 1 ) with the stronger ls force , the abnormal spin - parity @xmath47 state comes down lower than the normal negative parity states , which is consistent with the experimental data . in both cases , we found some rotational bands @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , although the order of the levels depends on the adopted interaction .",
    "the @xmath62 band has a large moment of inertia and reaches to the high spin states .",
    "the highest spin is @xmath63 in case(1 ) and @xmath64 in case ( 2 ) .",
    "it is expected that the @xmath62 band may reach to the further high spin such as a @xmath65 state in the calculations with a smaller value of the majorana parameter .",
    "next we analyze the intrinsic wave functions of the obtained rotational bands . in the results of @xmath43be ,",
    "2@xmath0 clustering structures appear very often in many states .",
    "the schematic figures are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : be11int ] .",
    "two alpha cores are found in the states of the lowest negative parity band @xmath60 ( fig.[fig : be11int](a ) ) . in the positive parity states ,",
    "one neutron is in the @xmath66 orbit and the 2@xmath0 clustering develops ( fig.[fig : be11int](b ) ) .",
    "we think that one of the reason of the energy gain of the positive parity states is considered to be the clustering development .",
    "the interesting point is that the @xmath62 band comes from the well - developed molecule - like structure with 2 neutrons in the @xmath66 orbit ( fig.[fig : be11int](c ) ) .",
    "the large moment of inertia results from the largely deformed intrinsic structure . at about 10 mev",
    ", we found another characteristic state where one of the 2 @xmath0-clusters completely breaks ( fig.[fig : be11int](d ) ) . in this state the intrinsic spins of 2 protons couple up to be totally a unit .",
    "as mentioned above , various structures coexist in the low energy region in @xmath43be .",
    "it is expected that the valence neutrons play important roles in these excited states .",
    "we discuss the gamow - teller(gt ) transitions in order to analyze the level structures of @xmath43be .",
    "first we consider @xmath67 decay from @xmath43b .",
    "the experimental data of gt - type transitions from the ground state of @xmath43b are deduced from the @xmath68 cross sections of the charge exchange reactions @xcite . comparing the calculated log ft values with experimental data ( fig.[fig : be11beta ] ) , the observed three levels",
    "well correspond to the excited states in the lowest @xmath60 band .",
    "it is natural that the gt transitions from @xmath43b to these levels are reasonably strong because both the parent and the daughter states are ordinary @xmath48-shell states .",
    "the beta decays from @xmath43li are shown in fig.[fig : be11beta ] .",
    "we notice that the ideal 2@xmath0-cluster structures in the daughter @xmath43be states forbid any gt transitions from @xmath43li because of the pauli forbidden . in other words ,",
    "the gt transitions from @xmath43li are allowed only if the daughter states of @xmath43be have the component with the breaking of the @xmath0 clusters .",
    "the calculations well agree with the experimental log ft values . according to the calculated results ,",
    "the lowest @xmath69 and @xmath70 states in the @xmath60 band have the more than 10 % breaking of the clusters .",
    "one of the reason for the weak gt transition to the lowest @xmath71 state is the clustering structure of @xmath43be .",
    "another reason is suggested by suzuki et.al @xcite as the halo structure of the parent @xmath43li state , which may not be described enough in the present amd calculations . in the calculations , transitions for the higher excited states in the @xmath62 band",
    "are suppressed because of the @xmath0 clusters in the developed molecule - like structures . the strong transition to the excited state at 8 mev well fits to the calculated @xmath69 state ( @xmath7210 mev ) where one of the two @xmath0 clusters completely breaks .    as for the @xmath73 transitions ,",
    "the @xmath74 of the present calculations is much smaller than the experimental data .",
    "we should describe the wave function more precisely to reproduce the strength @xmath75 .",
    "we studied the structure of the excited states of @xmath42be and @xmath43be and analyzed the level structure with the help of the data of gamow - teller transitions .    in @xmath42be",
    ", it is found that the ground state has the developed clustering structure instead of the neutron @xmath48-shell closed state .",
    "the main component of the ground state is the @xmath76-@xmath77 state in terms of a simple shell model .",
    "that is to say the neutron magic number 8 disappears in @xmath42be .",
    "it is consistent with the small gt strength to @xmath42be .",
    "many molecule - like states make rotational bands in low energy regions .    in the case of @xmath43be ,",
    "various structures are seen in the excited states . in the results rotational bands with the the developed clustering states",
    "are suggested .",
    "we discuss the gamow - teller transitions comparing the amd calculations with the experimental data .",
    "the experimental data of gt transitions from @xmath43b well agree with the theoretical results of the decay to the ordinary @xmath48-shell states of @xmath43be . with the help of the log ft values for the transitions from @xmath43li , we can estimate the dissociation of @xmath0 clusters in the daughter @xmath43be nucleus .",
    "the observed strong gt transitions from @xmath43li to @xmath43be at 8 mev comes from the breaking of the one of the 2 @xmath0 clusters in the excited state of the daughter nucleus @xmath43be .",
