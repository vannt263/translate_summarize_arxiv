    "a major motivation for the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments@xcite is to shed light into the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "as the lep precision measurements favour a relatively light higgs boson , its decay into a pair of photons is a prominent search channel which deserves intense consideration from the theoretical side .",
    "the inclusion of qcd radiative corrections is mandatory not only for the signal but also for the background if one is aiming towards reliable predictions . in this respect",
    "it is important to note that especially at lhc , but also at the tevatron , prompt photon signals  photons which do not stem from mesonic decays  are in general contaminated by @xmath7 events .",
    "the photon pairs from the mesonic decay which are very collimated , if the pions have a high momentum compared to the pion mass , may appear as single ( fake ) photons inside the detector .",
    "this background is especially worrisome in collider experiments , such as the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) @xcite and d0 @xcite experiments at the fermilab tevatron , where the pions can not all be reconstructed event by event . at the lhc @xmath0 and @xmath8 production represent an important fraction of the reducible background to the search of neutral higgs bosons in the channel @xmath9 in the intermediate mass range 80140 gev .",
    "since the jet - jet cross section is about eight orders of magnitude larger than the expected higgs boson signal for a standard model higgs boson , this reducible background is overwhelming before any selection cut is imposed .",
    "regarding both issues of prompt diphoton production and higgs boson search , various cuts , especially isolation cuts in transverse energy have to be imposed to the candidate events , in order to reject most of this background . yet , the actual fraction of this background which passes these cuts is not negligible , and it is not well known . up to now",
    "its estimations rely on monte carlo simulations encoding the partonic subprocesses at the leading logarithmic ( ll ) accuracy only .",
    "we may thus worry about large higher order corrections which may be not accurately reproduced by parton showers .",
    "furthermore , the hadronisation models matched with the partonic ingredients in these simulations are tuned to describe correctly the bulk of pion production , but they may not be accurate in the kinematical region relevant for the pions which pass the cut .",
    "a tentatively quantitative study of isolated @xmath0 and @xmath8 production , confronted to a careful analysis of data collected at the tevatron could improve this situation .",
    "the motivation of this article is to provide a study of full next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy , based on the computer code _",
    "diphox _ as an attempt in this direction .",
    "the computer program _",
    "diphox _ on which our study relies is a monte carlo code of partonic event generator type .",
    "this code has been designed to describe the production of pairs of particles in hadronic collisions , accounting for all contributing partonic processes at full nlo accuracy .",
    "these particles can be prompt photons or hadrons , in particular neutral pions .",
    "this code is flexible enough to accommodate various kinematic or calorimetric cuts .",
    "especially , it allows to compute cross sections for isolated @xmath0 and @xmath8 pairs , for any infrared and collinear safe isolation criterion which can be implemented at the partonic level .",
    "the physical content and schematical description of _ diphox _ has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we have concentrated on the case of diphoton production @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we recalled briefly how to use this code also in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , and we focused on the phenomenology of dipion production at fixed target energies , with a comparison to the data of the e706 experiment @xcite at the tevatron .",
    "a similar study was also presented in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the comparison was to confront the theoretical framework on which _ diphox _ relies to existing dipion data in order to validate this framework before transporting this knowledge to collider energies @xcite using the factorisation property of perturbative qcd .",
    "the main goal of the present article is to provide a nlo prediction for the reducible background to higgs boson searches in the mass range 80140 gev at the lhc . in section 2",
    "we present estimates for distributions which are of interest regarding the higgs boson search , such as the distributions of invariant mass and transverse momentum of a pair . in section 3",
    "we will extensively discuss the uncertainties of our next  to  leading order approach induced by severe experimental cuts .",
    "finally section 4 gathers our conclusions and some outlook .",
    "in this section we discuss nlo predictions for the @xmath0 and @xmath8 reducible background to the neutral higgs boson search channel @xmath12 in the intermediate mass range 80140 gev at the lhc .",
    "all nlo curves where computed with the _ diphox _ code , version ( 1.2 ) .",
    "for all figures we are using the mrst2 @xcite parton distribution functions , and , if not stated differently , the kkp fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "for all plots given below the following cuts on the transverse momenta , pseudo rapidities of the photons / pions and their invariant mass were applied : @xmath13 in addition , isolation cuts are imposed to reject events which are accompanied by a certain amount of hadronic energy , as this is typically not the case for photonic higgs decay .",
    "a photon is said to be isolated if , in a cone in rapidity and azimuthal angle about the photon direction , the amount of deposited hadronic transverse energy @xmath14 is smaller than some value @xmath15 fixed by the experiment : @xmath16 the actual experimental criteria , which are defined at the detector level , are much more complicated than the simple one given by eq .",

    "the topic of isolation of photons based on the above criterion is extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we stress that there is a subtle interplay between higher order corrections and the experimental cuts .",
    "these subtleties will be discussed in the next section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_all_et00 ] we show the invariant mass spectra of @xmath17 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 pairs for a very loose isolation criterion of @xmath18 gev in a cone of @xmath19 at nlo .",
    "note that the fully inclusive case would be plagued by uncertainties stemming from the low@xmath3 regime of the pion fragmentation functions ( see discussion below ) . to avoid this source of uncertainty we do not present figures showing the inclusive rate .",
    "the plot shows the importance of the reducible @xmath20 , @xmath11 backgrounds before isolation cuts . the @xmath20 component is more than an order of magnitude above the @xmath17 background .",
    "the @xmath11 background is of the order of several hundreds of pb / gev .",
    "tightening the isolation requirement by imposing @xmath21 gev changes the production rate of these components .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_all_et10 ] .",
    "we remind that the very narrow higgs signal will be a sharp peak  its width is determined by the detector resolution of around 1 gev  ranging from 50 to 100 fb / gev in the given mass window @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 background is reduced considerably whereas the @xmath10 background is still of the order of the irreducible diphoton background .",
    "concerning the prompt photon pairs , the used isolation criterion reduces its rate by about a factor of two , because the fragmentation component of the prompt photon pair is vetoed by isolation cuts .",
    "note that for the given isolation criteria not only direct photon pairs remain .",
    "for @xmath22 gev almost 20 per cent of the total rate still come from fragmentation in the given plot for the scale choice used .",
    "[ fig : lhc_gg_mgg_isol ] shows the suppression of the irreducible diphoton background when isolation is imposed . to suppress photons from fragmentation more efficiently harder isolation cuts than the ones shown in the plot have to be imposed .",

    "these corrections have been computed recently @xcite but are not yet implemented in _",

    "[ fig : lhc_pg_mpg_isol ] . due to",
    "the collinear fragmentation model used the hadronic energy is mainly located along the fragmenting particle .",
    "this leads to the fact that there is no significant @xmath24 dependence present .",
    "only genuine higher order @xmath25 matrix elements can induce such a dependence and we only state that they are on the per cent level . in the case of photon  pion production two mechanisms for the production of the photon are possible .",
    "the photon can be produced directly in a hard interaction or through fragmentation . in the case of isolation",
    "the latter component is reduced by an order of magnitude as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_mgp_dir_vs_fra ] . for completeness we provide with the plot for the invariant mass distribution of pion pairs , fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pp_mpp_isol ] . in a realistic experimental situation the pion rates can be suppressed further . in the relevant @xmath26 range , an extra reduction factor of 2 to 3 per pion",
    "can be expected in fine - grained detectors with recognition of isolated @xmath7 as two overlapping showers @xcite .",
    "another spectrum of relevance is the transverse momentum distribution of the pair produced particles , @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_qt_do ] this distribution is shown for two isolation criteria .",
    "recall that the full pion photon rate is built up out of the direct component and the fragmentation component . at colliders which operate at lower energies",
    "the fragmentation component is typically only a fraction of the full rate . through isolation",
    "the fragmentation component dies out quickly .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_qt_isol ] gives an idea of the suppression factors due to isolation .",
    "note that this theoretical curve is not reliable in the first few bins , as multiple soft gluon emission alters the divergent behaviour of the fixed order calculation .",
    "near @xmath28 the partonic cross section diverges logarithmically .",
    "this divergence is diluted by convoluting the partonic cross section with the pion fragmentation function .",
    "also at @xmath29 there is a critical point inside the physical spectrum ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the large bin width prevents from observing this singular behaviour . to deal with these issues in a rigorous way",
    "is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "hard isolation cuts test fragmentation functions at high @xmath3 values , where current parametrisations are not at all constrained by experimental data .",
    "this problem is visualised in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_mpg_kkp_bkk ] where we show the photon  pion invariant mass distribution calculated with both , the kkp @xcite and the older bkk @xcite fragmentation functions .",
    "the kkp parametrisation leads to a higher prediction than the bkk one .",
    "the ratio of the two curves ( kkp / bkk ) is about 3/2 . for dipion observables",
    "the situation is much worse . in fig .",
    "[ fig : frag_pi_50 ] the discrepancy between the bkk and kkp parametrisations in the critical region is shown .",
    "one observes that at high @xmath3 values the fragmentation gluon  to  pion is strongly suppressed .",
    "focusing on the quark  to  pion fragmentation , one sees that for high @xmath3 values the parametrisations differ considerably .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "we have to comment now on the remaining theoretical uncertainty due to higher order corrections . as will be pointed out below the large @xmath3 region",
    "is dangerous for the predictive power of nlo calculations because terms are produced which are divergent as @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_mpg_nlo_lo ] , we plot lo and nlo predictions for the invariant mass distribution of the photon ",
    "pion pair for several isolation criteria .",
    "note that the ratio of both curves is pretty stable with decreasing @xmath31 .",
    "the ratio of both curves lies around 1.7 , a typical value for a nlo correction .",
    "we just mention that the situation worsens as @xmath31 is reduced further which indicates the presence of large nlo contributions induced by pressing @xmath3 to one . as will be pointed out below there are two reasons for that .",
    "phase space regions which are excluded at lo are populated at nlo and become dominant , and large logarithms of @xmath32 are introduced . to have a proper control on the latter fixed order effect",
    ", a resummation of the relevant contributions is needed . for the isolation criteria used in the given plots we conclude from the nlo to lo ratios that these effects are not yet dominant .",
    "still , for harder isolation criteria the predictivity of our fixed order approach has to be critically investigated .",
    "as the isolation cuts spoil compensations between scale dependent lo and nlo contributions the scale dependence remains important .",
    "to give an idea of the uncertainties we have plotted the variation of the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath20 pairs under the change of renormalization ( @xmath33 ) , factorisation ( @xmath34 ) and fragmentation scale ( @xmath35 ) for a strict isolation criterion in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_mpg_scaledep ] . by multiplying our standard scale choice by 1/2 and 2",
    "one finds variation of about + 40 per cent to 30 per cent .",
    "this variation is reduced if one uses less restrictive experimental cuts .",
    "the importance of nlo calculations is best visible in distributions which are restricted by lo kinematics .",
    "no lo parton shower can provide for a correct description of events far away from the lo kinematics .",
    "a relevant observable to exemplify this point is the @xmath36 distribution of a photon ",
    "pion pair .",
    "increasing the isolation criterion , suppresses the lo phase space more and more , such that finally the whole tail of the distribution is a pure nlo effect , see fig .",

    "[ fig : lhc_pg_qt_isol ] . for a comparison of the shape of our _ diphox _",
    "prediction to pythia see @xcite .",
    "to understand the reliability of the presented predictions it is necessary to discuss the interplay between experimental cuts and theoretical nlo results .",
    "qcd cross sections are stabilised by the inclusion of higher order corrections , as scale dependencies are reduced .",
    "this works generally the better the more inclusive the observables are . yet",
    ", the collider experiments at the tevatron and the forthcoming lhc do not perform inclusive photon measurements .",
    "the experimental selection of prompt photons requires isolation cuts .",
    "we always use the cone isolation criterion introduced in eq .",
    "( [ isol ] ) . for the hadronic energy propagating into the isolation cone two sources can be distinguished in an experimental setup .",
    "first there is a component which stems from the actual partonic , hard reaction which may be mapped to certain feynman diagrams  this component is calculable inside a qcd calculation to a given order . and second there is a component coming from multiple - interactions and other events in the same particle bunch ( pile  up ) .",
    "one has to be aware of the fact that an experimentally used @xmath15 is thus always bigger than a partonic value used in our study .",
    "it is even so that the experimental values @xmath15 are so small that a large fraction of the allowed hadronic transverse energy accompanying the candidate photon may come from such events .",
    "this leaves not much phase space for partonic fragmentation reactions . in the following we mean with @xmath15 only the hadronic energy stemming from the hard interaction .",
    "the sensitivity on @xmath15 defined in eq .",
    "( [ isol ] ) is best seen by looking at the fragmentation variable @xmath3 , which is the momentum fraction of a hadron , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , and its parent parton @xmath26 . at",
    "lo the kinematical constraints on this variable are induced by the experimental cuts through the collinearity assumption in the fragmentation model , @xmath39 .",
    "one finds @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the experimental cut on @xmath37 .",
    "evidently , the variable @xmath3 is pressed towards one , as the ratio @xmath42 decreases , means for hard isolation . at nlo , where extra radiated partons are present ,",
    "this bound is even more severe as the veto is more easily fulfilled .",
    "the bulk of the pions which are produced in collider events correspond to values of @xmath3 substantially smaller than 1 .",
    "hard isolation tests only the very end of the @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "the question is , wether we can reliably estimate the production rate of these high@xmath3 pions , and especially of hard @xmath0 and @xmath1 pairs .",
    "we find three aspects important in this respect , which are discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "the usual fixed order perturbative qcd calculations of hadro production ",
    "as e.g. the one coded in _",
    "diphox _  rely on a model of independent collinear fragmentation through fragmentation functions of a parton of species @xmath43 ( quark of any flavour , or gluon ) into a pion , @xmath44 , @xmath3 is defined above .",
    "let us first comment on the uncertainties at small @xmath3 , where this treatment is questionable .",
    "in particular the fixed order calculations do not resum the @xmath45 arising order by order in perturbation theory , which become large in the small @xmath3 region .",
    "the latter are associated with coherence effects in the multiple emission of soft gluons , which control the inclusive production of small @xmath3 pions @xcite .",
    "therefore this usual framework is notoriously inadapted to account for the production of these small @xmath3 pions .",
    "moreover the dominant @xmath3 values at colliders are smaller than for fixed targets , as a consequence of scaling violations .",
    "therefore the erroneous treatment of the fragmentation process at small @xmath3 will plague the estimates of inclusive dipion observables at colliders .",
    "this is the reason why the fits of independent fragmentation functions @xmath46 to experimental data presented in the literature @xcite , and which we use in this work , start above some minimum value for @xmath3 , e.g. @xmath47 .",
    "the independent fragmentation framework is expected to account correctly for the production of pions with larger @xmath3 values .",
    "the requirement of a loose isolation criterion such as , for example @xmath48  100  gev for pions with @xmath49  25  gev imposes that @xmath50 over the whole @xmath51 range of interest . to avoid uncertainties due to small @xmath3 values , as was pointed out already",
    ", we do not provide estimates for inclusive observables , but only for observables corresponding to pions submitted to isolation cuts .",
    "the behaviour near the end point , @xmath52 , is responsible for most of the uncertainties that plague the present study .",
    "indeed , the use of very tight isolation cuts such as those used by the collider experiments select the vicinity of the elastic boundary @xmath53 . for example , in the run ib of the tevatron , for prompt photon measurements , cdf required @xmath54 gev in a cone @xmath55 . for @xmath56",
    "gev , this means @xmath57 .",
    "the value @xmath54 gev required by the cdf experiment includes also the deposition of hadronic transverse energy coming from underlying events , while the latter are ignored in our partonic calculation as noted above .",
    "consequently , the actual effective value of @xmath15 which should be used in a partonic calculation should be even smaller , the effective @xmath58 would be even larger .",
    "however the fragmentation functions @xmath59 are fitted to data corresponding essentially to @xmath60 , i.e. much below the relevant region for the present study .",
    "moreover , the data used in @xcite concern hadronic final states in @xmath61 annihilation .",
    "the gluon  to  pion fragmentation function is poorly constrained at moderate and large @xmath3 by this process because the subprocesses involving gluons in @xmath61 annihilation appear at higher order in the perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath62 , while subprocesses involving outgoing gluons contribute at lowest order in hadronic collisions .",
    "although the contributions from gluon fragmentation are not expected to dominate , large uncertainties on their magnitude may still affect quantitative predictions . in order to illustrate",
    "how poor the present - day control over the large @xmath3 region is , it is instructive to compare the extrapolations of the kkp and bkk sets of parton - to-@xmath63 fragmentation functions .",
    "the kkp set is the most recent one , and it is constrained by more data , especially the lep1 data at the @xmath64 peak , in the region @xmath65 .",
    "these two sets use different analytic anstze .",
    "these different anstze do not differ very much in the @xmath3 range in which they are most constrained by the @xmath61 data of course , but their respective extrapolations turn out to differ substantially from each other above @xmath66 , especially between @xmath67 and 1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frag_pi_50 ] .",
    "this is true for the gluon , but also , though to a lesser extend , for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 fragmentation functions .",
    "this translates into a large uncertainty for the predictions of the reducible higgs boson background in the channel @xmath2 in the mass range 80140 gev .",
    "clearly a determination of fragmentation above @xmath66 from data sensitive to this range is required for any further accurate prediction .",
    "such an experimental input could in principle be provided by data on inclusive @xmath7 production at fixed target energy @xcite , as well as measurements of isolated pions by the collider experiments cdf and d0 , in association with their prompt photon measurements .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the present inaccuracy of the description of fragmentation at large @xmath3 is not only a problem confined to the type of perturbative qcd calculations which are discussed in this article .",
    "they also potentially affect the fragmentation stage of the  full hadronic event generators \" such as pythia @xcite and herwig @xcite as well .",
    "indeed , the respective fragmentation ingredients of these event generators have been tuned to describe accurately the bulk of the data , especially at lep , whereas the tails of the distributions near the end point have , to our knowledge , never been analysed in detail .",
    "in addition , the parton showers implemented in these event generators provide an effective summation of the soft gluon effects near @xmath53 at a leading logarithmic accuracy ; on the other hand they miss a part of the higher order corrections to the partonic hard subprocesses which may be large .",
    "the respective approximations in the  partonic calculations \" on one hand , the full event generators on the other hand , being different , it would be instructive to compare the results given by both approaches@xcite .      as the production of isolated pions at colliders and",
    "the one of inclusive pions at fixed target experiment , deal with @xmath3 values near the end point @xmath70 , the theoretical calculation of the partonic subprocesses is confronted with the appearance of powers of large logarithmic terms @xmath71 to any fixed order in perturbation theory .",
    "these large logarithms have in principle to be summed to all orders in order to improve  if not restore  the predictive power of the partonic calculation .",
    "the general framework to resum infrared logarithms in hadronic collisions has been settled in @xcite , however further work is needed to treat the endpoint summation in the case of one particle production , even more for pair production , where the kinematics is more constrained . in the present study , we investigate what can be done without such summations , relying on the extrapolations of the fragmentation functions available in the literature , and examining critically the limitations of our approach .    to be explicit let us consider the process @xmath72 in detail .",
    "the photon can be either direct or from fragmentation .",
    "the second case is considerably suppressed if one imposes severe isolation ; thus we deal with the direct process only . at leading order",
    "there are two types of partonic processes : @xmath73 stands for quark or antiquark .",
    "] , @xmath74 . at small @xmath75 values typical for the lhc",
    "the first is dominant .",
    "radiative corrections give rise to initial state and final state singularities .",
    "only the latter are of relevance for the point to be made here .",
    "they arise from the splitting of the outgoing parent quark into a quark and a gluon . both may fragment into a pion but , again , for severe isolation one may focus on the dominant @xmath76 fragmentation only .",
    "thus we are looking at the case where a collinear gluon is radiated of a hard quark , indicated by the subscript @xmath77 , which subsequently fragments into a pion .",

    "note that outside the bracket , up to the factor @xmath96 , one has just the approximation for the leading order contribution .",
    "this means that the bracket itself times this factor could be taken as a good approximation for the higher order part of a @xmath97 factor factor depends on the experimental cuts applied and on the scale choice .",

    "@xmath98\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in here a factor of two is included from the second process with initial partons @xmath99 .",
    "to get a feeling for the typical scales in the case of isolation one may try to choose @xmath35 such that the large logarithms compensate for a @xmath100 .",
    "this can be achieved by a ( optimal ) scale choice @xmath101 plugging in @xmath102 gev . for asymmetric",

    "the fact that the optimal scale in eq .",
    "( [ opti - scale ] ) goes to zero , as @xmath109 goes to zero indicates that the cone isolation criterion is not infrared safe in this limit . in other words , if the experimental value of @xmath109 is already saturated by events from the hadronic environment such that there is no phase space left for the hard parton , fixed order calculations are not applicable .",
    "it should be stressed that the whole discussion was neglecting constant terms and sub - leading logarithms .",
    "thus it should only give a rough idea of the much more involved , complete situation .",
    "using the same approximations the exercise can be worked through keeping also non  leading terms .",
    "the result is that one encounters in realistic situations additive contributions which are of the same size as the considered ones .",
    "all this deserves further investigations especially in the light of a possible resummation of the large logarithms and the role of these terms .      in lhc studies concerning higgs boson search the used @xmath26 cuts are commonly asymmetric .",
    "we want to make the point here that this jeopardizes the predictive power of nlo calculations .",
    "the interplay between such asymmetric cuts and hard isolation criteria leads at lo to vetoed phase space regions which are filled by nlo processes only . the effect is visualised in fig .

    "one observes that the lo component is suppressed for low @xmath26 values .",
    "this can be understood as follows : + due to transverse momentum conservation , one has @xmath113 where the pion 1 is assumed to have higher @xmath26 than pion 2 .",
    "this means for the transverse momentum of the pair , @xmath36 that @xmath114 and because @xmath115 (= 40 gev in our case ) @xmath116 this means that in the case of @xmath117 one has a phase space restriction coming from the isolation criterion .",
    "note that a saturation of the bound , @xmath118 is only possible if @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "but in this limit the fragmentation function goes to zero and suppresses the cross section additionally .",
    "this will not happen in the case of photon  pion production where the same formulas apply with @xmath121 .",
    "( [ ptbound ] ) is also true and leads to a restriction of the phase space but there is no additional suppression .",
    "the problem aggravates for lower @xmath122 values but becomes less relevant when @xmath123 and vanishes in the case of symmetric cuts @xmath124 .",
    "the hole in the @xmath26 spectrum will be filled with events from higher order corrections . as the low @xmath26 region is energetically preferred , one gets numerically important nlo contribution to the cross section in the dipion case .",
    "the ratio between lo and nlo can become very big due to this effect . as pointed out , in photon ",
    "pion production the lo order contribution is less suppressed and the effect is milder . in the @xmath36 distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_qt_isol ] , one observes that only the first bin contains the lo contribution due to the same kinematical restriction mentioned above . on the other hand the nlo contribution is basically zero there ( even below the plotted range ) .",
    "this is because pions with @xmath26 s as large as the photon @xmath26 are disfavoured .",
    "the steep fall of the quark  to  pion fragmentation functions makes it very unlikely to find a photon ",
    "pion pair with @xmath125 gev which is needed to have @xmath126 .    from the discussion",
    "one sees that symmetric cuts are preferable from theoretical side for processes which have to be suppressed by isolation . whereas this effect is for sure important for dipion production",
    "the effect is numerically sizable in the photon ",
    "pion case only for isolation criteria which are harder than the ones given in the presented figures .",
    "as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_pg_mpg_nlo_lo ] , the ratio of the nlo to lo curves does not explode because the discussed phase space effect is not yet numerically sizable .",
    "still we want to make the point that our nlo analysis suggest to choose symmetric transverse momentum cuts as theoretical higher order predictions tend to be more reliable in that case .",
    "we have presented a full next to leading order study of the production of @xmath127 as well as @xmath128 pairs with a large invariant mass relying on the computer code _ diphox_. we have presented estimates for invariant mass and transverse momentum of the pair ( @xmath36 ) distributions taking into account realistic experimental cuts .",
    "the nlo corrections are large .",
    "theoretical calculation improves the scale dependences in the case of inclusive observables . on the other hand ,",
    "the results remain plagued by large uncertainties even in the nlo approximation , if realistic isolation criteria are applied .",
    "one source of large uncertainties is our poor present knowledge of the parton  to  pion fragmentation functions at large @xmath3 .",
    "the estimates which we have presented here rely on extrapolations of analytical anstze for these fragmentation functions for values of @xmath3 above 0.8 , i.e. outside the region where they were fitted to the data .",
    "the spreading of the extrapolations of different sets of parametrisations available in the literature for @xmath3 above 0.8 illustrates this fact .",
    "experimental information may be provided by inclusive measurements of single pions and pions pairs at fixed targets , e.g. as performed by the e706 experiment @xcite , as well as by measurements of isolated pions at colliders , as could be performed by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite experiments .",
    "apart from this more experimental issue we pointed out that our next - to - leading order approach is still plagued by relatively large uncertainties due to phase space effects related to the different lo and nlo kinematics and also the presence of potentially large logarithms @xmath129 , if severe isolation cuts are imposed . concerning the phase space effect",
    ", we discussed that symmetric @xmath26 cuts for the pions / photons are preferable from theoretical side .",
    "otherwise nlo corrections are magnified in phase space regions vetoed at lowest order .",
    "our predictions for @xmath10 production seems still reliable , up to scale variations of around 40 per cent , for the used isolation cuts . the same can not be said for @xmath11 production .",
    "the region @xmath30 is probed in a more critical way in this case .",
    "further , predictions are very sensitive to the unconstrained part of fragmentation functions .",
    "we have to conclude that the uncertainties for this component of the reducible background for higgs searches are not under control from theoretical side even at the next  to  leading order level .",
    "we only quote that we find large k factors and large scale variations , factors of 3 to 4 respectively , if we use the same isolation cuts as was done for the isolated @xmath10 production case .",
    "fortunately this component to the diphoton background can be suppressed experimentally by separating pions from photons by distinguishing the shapes of the corresponding electromagnetic showers .",
    "reduction factors of 2 to 3 per pion are possible and compensate somewhat the poor knowledge of the pion rates .",
    "still , a more satisfactory theoretical knowledge of the dipion and pion / photon rates at lhc requires a better understanding of fragmentation functions near @xmath130 , the resummation of large endpoint logarithms of @xmath32 , together with the use of experimental cuts which do not destabilise compensations between lo and higher order contributions .    from the discussion above",
    "it should be clear that it is a delicate issue to make definite predictions for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 component of the @xmath131 background .",
    "all statements depend strongly on the experimental cuts .",
    "especially severe isolation cuts restrict the predictivity of our result . to make some explicit statements we just want to remind how the @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 rates compare to the irreducible @xmath17 background for a definite isolation criterion , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_all_et10 ] . as the higgs boson of the standard model",
    "is already restricted by the lep experiments to have a mass of @xmath132 gev , the @xmath10 rate is about a factor of two below the irreducible @xmath17 background .",
    "uncertainties due to fragmentation functions and scale variations may be factors of around two .",
    "on the other hand additional experimental capabilities based e.g. on calorimetric studies indicate that the rejection factor of pions w.r.t isolated photons can be improved by at least a factor two @xcite .",
    "these numbers suggest a conservative upper bound on the ratio of the @xmath10 , @xmath17 rates of @xmath133 .",
    "if one tightens the isolation criterion this will be further reduced , though one has to keep in mind that the theoretical uncertainty is getting more important . in this respect",
    "we note that a comparison with pythia distributions shows that our rates are lower if compared to default pythia settings @xcite . though we want to stress the relevance of a next  to",
    " leading order analysis , from our discussion one may not expect that the @xmath10 process becomes a dangerous background . as already noted above the uncertainties from fragmentation functions and scale variation for the @xmath11 rate",
    "are substantial . to be conservative factors as big as ten should be considered .",
    "assuming again a reduction factor of two per pion from pion  photon separation would lead in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_all_et10 ] to a @xmath11 to @xmath17 ratio of around 1/3 for @xmath134 gev .",
    "more severe isolation will suppress this ratio considerably again with the price of even increased uncertainties .",
    "note that the given numbers should only give an idea of the situation , as they depend strongly on the experimental settings .",
    "we can tentatively conclude that next  to  leading order corrections should not change the qualitative statement that the @xmath11 , @xmath20 backgrounds are sufficiently under control at the lhc , although a couple of interesting qcd issues plaguing them still deserve to be addressed .",
