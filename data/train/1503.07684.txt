    "recently the coherent dynamics of spin excitations in semiconductor heterostructures has attracted considerable interest , motivated in particular by the observation of long electron spin relaxation and coherence times  @xcite , one of the main prerequisites for a system to be suited for quantum information technologies . to obtain access to these times ,",
    "optical techniques have proofed to be an effective measurement tool .",
    "generally , the phenomenon of optical orientation is used to create the initial spin orientation  @xcite .",
    "it involves two processes : the photogeneration of spin - oriented carriers by absorption of circularly polarized light and the possible spin relaxation with the characteristic time @xmath4 during the lifetime @xmath5 of these carriers  @xcite . in order to determine absolute values of these times",
    "one often uses an `` internal clock '' of the system : the periodic larmor precession of the electron spins about an external magnetic field with the frequency @xmath6 can be used as such a clock . here",
    "@xmath7 is the bohr magneton and @xmath8 is the land factor of the electrons .",
    "one of the common methods to study spin lifetimes @xmath9 in atoms  @xcite and in solid state systems  @xcite is the measurement of the hanle effect .",
    "the hanle effect analyzes the decrease of the carrier spin polarization ( typically via the circular polarization degree of photoluminescence ) in a transverse magnetic field so that it also employs the clock defined by the larmor precession . for relatively strong magnetic fields ,",
    "for which the spin lifetime @xmath10 is long compared to the time scale determined by the larmor precession frequency @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , the electron spins perform many revolutions during their lifetime  @xcite . thus , the spin polarization along the direction of observation decreases with increasing transverse magnetic field .",
    "the hanle curve describes this behavior .",
    "its half - width at half maximum is given by @xmath13 ) , so the spin lifetime @xmath10 can be obtained by measuring the hanle curve , if the @xmath14 factor is known  @xcite .",
    "any hanle effect - based method is based on the relaxation time approximation , in which the dynamics is described by one or a few exponents .",
    "it is a fair approximation , if the relaxation is caused , for example , by processes with short correlation times ( markovian processes ) since these short correlation times lead to dynamic averaging over magnetic fields of different origin , acting on the electron .",
    "however , this approximation is violated for strongly localized electrons , when the dwell time of the electron on the donor exceeds the precession period of the electron spin in the hyperfine field of the nuclei .",
    "the width of the hanle curve for donor - bound electron spins is determined by the relatively rapid precession in static nuclear fields  @xcite , i.e. by the spin dephasing time @xmath15 , and not by the longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath0 , which can be much longer than the precession period in the frozen nuclear field .",
    "precession in static fields is reversible and to eliminate their effect the spin - echo method can be used  @xcite . however",
    ", this leads to a complication of experiments on the irreversible spin dynamics , designed to determine the @xmath0 time .",
    "we propose a different approach to measure the spin lifetime , which does not rely on the precession of the spins in a magnetic field applied in the voigt geometry .",
    "this method uses an external clock instead of an internal one , namely the periodic polarization modulation of the exciting light with the modulation frequency @xmath16 , and exploits the inertia of the spins : when switching the helicity of the light the steady - state value of the electron spin polarization is reached within a characteristic time @xmath10 . at low modulation frequencies",
    "@xmath17 , compared to the time scale given by the spin lifetime , the electron spin polarization can overcome the spin inertia and reach its steady - state value for a particular laser polarization period . for high modulation frequencies @xmath18 , on the other hand , the electron spin polarization remains reduced since it can not reach its steady - state value within a duty cycle with fixed circular polarization .",
    "the fall or rise of the spin polarization in dependence on the modulation frequency corresponds to the spin lifetime . with this method",
    "one can measure the spin lifetime in a weak magnetic field , when the dynamics of the average spin is determined by relaxation processes in random fields that are not subject to dynamic averaging , i.  e. , when the method based on the hanle effect can not provide the time @xmath10 .",
    "a similar method was used by akimov et al .",
    "@xcite to study the electron spin dynamics in epitaxial cdse / znse quantum dots .",
    "the method combines time- and polarization - resolved measurements of the emission from the trion singlet ground state with helicity modulation of the exciting light .",
    "however , the spin polarization was not measured in dependence of the modulation frequency by akimov et al .",
    ", so our method can be seen as an advancement . fras et al . performed differential transmission measurements of inas",
    "/ gaas quantum dots using the optical pump - probe technique  @xcite . here , in addition to time - resolved measurements a technique called dark - bright time scanning spectroscopy was used , where the intensity of the exciting beam was modulated to measure in the frequency domain .",
    "fluorine doped znse recently emerged as a promising material system in the field of solid - state quantum information technologies .",
    "so far indistinguishable single - photon - sources and optically controllable electron spin qubits were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "current efforts focus on gaining a detailed understanding of the electron and nuclear spin dynamics in this material .    here",
    ", using the spin inertia method we investigate the spin dynamics of the strongly localized , donor - bound electrons in fluorine - doped znse epilayers in a wide range of magnetic fields , temperatures , and pump densities . the paper is organized as follows .",

    "discussion of the spin relaxation mechanisms is done in section  [ sec : discussion ] in combination with assessments on the applicability of the spin inertia method to various spin systems .",
    "we study two fluorine - doped znse epilayers with different doping concentrations .",
    "the samples consist of three layers grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on ( 001)-oriented gaas substrate .",
    "a thin znse buffer layer reduces the strain induced by the ii - vi on iii - v heteroepitaxy .",
    "the znse layer is followed by a 20-nm - thick zn@xmath19mg@xmath20 barrier layer , which prevents carrier diffusion into the substrate .",
    "the fluorine - doped , 70-nm - thick znse epilayer is grown on top of this barrier layer .",
    "sample # 1 has a fluorine concentration of about @xmath21 @xmath22 , while the doping of sample  # 2 is approximately three orders of magnitude higher ( @xmath23 @xmath22 ) . for the optical properties of these samples and for information on the electron spin dephasing",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the samples are placed in a vector magnet system consisting of three superconducting split - coils oriented orthogonally to each other @xcite .",
    "it allows us to switch the magnetic field from the faraday geometry ( magnetic field @xmath24 parallel to the sample growth axis and the light wave vector ) to the voigt geometry ( magnetic field @xmath25 perpendicular to the sample growth axis and the light wave vector ) .",
    "the switching can be performed by using the respective pairs of split coils and does not require any changes of the optical alignment . therefore we can measure in different magnetic field geometries with exactly the same adjustment of the pump and probe beams on a particular sample position .",
    "the measurements are performed at low temperatures with the samples either immersed in pumped liquid helium at @xmath26  k or cooled with controlled helium gas flow ( up to 45 k ) .",
    "photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra for sample characterization are excited using a continuous - wave ( cw ) laser with photon energy of 3.05  ev and detected with a si - based charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera attached to a 0.5-m spectrometer .",
    "we use the pump - probe technique to study the electron spin dynamics by time - resolved kerr rotation ( trkr ) .",
    "the electron spin coherence is created by circularly - polarized pump pulses of 1.5  ps duration ( spectral width of about 1  mev ) emitted by a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser operating at a repetition frequency of 75.7  mhz ( repetition period @xmath27  ns ) .",
    "the induced electron spin coherence is measured by linearly - polarized probe pulses of the same photon energy as the pump pulses ( degenerate pump - probe scheme ) .",
    "a mechanical delay line is used to scan the time delay between the probe and pump pulses .",
    "the photon energy is tuned into resonance with the donor - bound heavy - hole exciton ( d@xmath28x - hh ) at about 2.80  ev . to obtain this photon energy a beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal",
    "is used to double the frequency of the light generated by the ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the pump helicity is modulated between @xmath29 and @xmath30 polarization by an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) , so that on average the samples are equally exposed to left- and right - circularly - polarized pump pulses .",
    "the modulation frequency is varied between 10  khz and 700  khz .",
    "the photogenerated spin polarization results in a rotation of the polarization plane of the reflected , initially linear - polarized probe pulses due to the magneto - optical kerr effect .",
    "the kerr rotation ( kr ) angle is measured by a 10  mhz balanced photoreceiver with adjustable gain and bandwidth , connected to a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the pump density is varied in the range @xmath31  w/@xmath32 and the probe density ( @xmath33 ) is about one order of magnitude smaller than the pump density .",
    "we use three different implementations of the pump - probe kerr rotation method :    \\(1 ) the time - resolved kerr rotation configuration , where the kerr rotation angle is measured in dependence of the time delay between the pump and probe pulses with the magnetic field applied in the voigt geometry . in this case",
    "the larmor precession of the electron spin polarization around the magnetic field axis results in a signal which is a periodic function of the time delay and whose amplitude decreases with increasing time delay . using this configuration one can determine the @xmath14 factor of the carriers and the inhomogeneous spin dephasing times @xmath34 in the limit @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the resonant spin amplification ( rsa ) configuration  @xcite is used to determine @xmath34 when this time is comparable to or greater than the laser repetition period @xmath36 . here",
    "the time delay between pump and probe is fixed at a small negative value ( @xmath37  ps ) and one measures the kr angle in dependence of the magnetic field applied in the voigt geometry in the range from @xmath38 to @xmath39  mt . at certain magnetic fields the electrons spins precess in phase with the laser repetition frequency and one observes an increased kerr rotation signal .",
    "thus , the rsa signal consists of a symmetrical set of equidistant peaks , whose amplitude decreases with increasing magnetic field .",
    "\\(3 ) in the polarization recovery ( pr ) configuration the electron spin polarization is detected as well at a small negative time delay .",
    "the kr signal is measured in dependence of the magnetic field applied in the faraday geometry .",
    "the electron spin polarization , which is photogenerated along the magnetic field direction , does not exhibit larmor precession then .",
    "still it decreases by the nuclear hyperfine fields , if the external magnetic field is small compared to these fields .",
    "the effect of the hyperfine fields is suppressed with increasing external magnetic field . as a result",
    ", the electron spin polarization has its minimum at zero external magnetic field and increases with magnetic field .",
    "by varying the pump helicity modulation frequency one can measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath0 of the electrons .",
    "we will mostly use this implementation to study the spin dynamics of the donor - bound electrons .",
    "note that the measurement of the kr signals at negative time delay , prior to the pump pulse , as done in the rsa and pr configurations greatly simplifies the interpretation of the signal origin .",
    "these signals can only arise from long - living spins , whose lifetime exceeds @xmath40  ns .",
    "this is typically much longer than the exciton recombination time , so that the measured signals can originate only from resident electrons , which are bound to donors at low temperatures .",
    "in addition , we also perform pump - probe experiments using a cw pump and a pulsed probe . for these measurements a cw ti : sapphire laser with intra - cavity second harmonic generation is used as the pump , and the probe pulses are generated from the laser system described above .",
    "this configuration allows us to set the pump and the probe laser at different photon energies , i.e. to perform two - color nondegenerate pump - probe measurements .",
    "thereby we measure the pr and the suppression of the kr signal in the voigt geometry ( the hanle curve ) , to investigate possible influences of pulsed excitation on the spin relaxation .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the pl spectra of the two studied samples , measured at zero magnetic field for a temperature of @xmath41k .",

    "the observed oscillations reflect the larmor precession of the electron spin polarization .",
    "note that these oscillations are long - living and do not fully decay during the time interval @xmath40  ns between subsequent pump pulses , as can be seen from the considerable signal amplitude at negative time delays .",
    "the exciton lifetime in znse is shorter than 250  ps @xcite , which allows us to conclude that the long - living trkr signal originates from the coherent spin precession of the localized donor - bound electrons .",
    "the relatively large binding energy to these donors of 29  mev @xcite provides strong electron localization and makes the spin coherence robust even at elevated temperatures up to 40  k @xcite .",

    "the same value of @xmath53 is measured for sample  # 2 .",
    "due to the long decay of the trkr signal amplitude it is difficult to evaluate the electron spin dephasing time @xmath34 by fitting the amplitude decay in these measurements .",

    "[ fig:2](b ) by the blue line .",
    "the pr curve has a minimum at zero magnetic field , increases with increasing @xmath24 and saturates at fields exceeding 20  mt . obviously , the polarization recovery is caused by suppression of the depolarization of the electron spin along the magnetic field direction .",
    "we tentatively relate the depolarization around zero field to the effect of the fluctuating nuclear hyperfine fields , more details will be given in the discussion below .    as shown in figure  [ fig:2](b )",
    ", the amplitude of the zero rsa peak is a little smaller than the amplitude of the neighboring peaks .",
    "this may be due to the following factors : 1 ) a small , additional magnetic field component perpendicular to @xmath25 can lead to a reduction of the zero rsa peak amplitude @xcite .",

    "while in the first case ( @xmath110 , red line ) @xmath117 is equal to @xmath118 almost during the whole modulation period except for a small decrease , when the sign of the polarization is switched , the modulus of the spin polarization is strongly decreased during the whole modulation period for @xmath83 . ]",
    "investigation of the carriers spin dynamics by the spin inertia effect can be performed at zero as well as finite external magnetic fields . in magnetic field",
    "the evaluated spin relaxation time @xmath119 corresponds to the longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath0 .",
    "it is also valid for samples in which the electron spins are affected by randomly oriented hyperfine fields from the nuclear spin fluctuations  @xcite , namely , when the spin dephasing time @xmath34 caused by the nuclear fluctuations is considerably shorter than @xmath0 .",
    "note , that in this case the method based on the hanle effect is limited to measurements of the @xmath34 time , and not the @xmath0 time , we discuss this in more detail in sec .",
    "v.    for example , in our fluorine - doped znse samples the donor - bound electrons are strongly localized .",

    "@xcite : @xmath123 here @xmath124 .",
    "the term @xmath122 describes the precession of the spins in the frozen nuclear field with subsequent averaging over the gaussian distribution of these fields  @xcite . here one averages over an isotropic distribution of nuclear fields .",
    "thus , the generated electron spin polarization decreases to one third of its initial value  @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the width of the hanle curve is determined by the shortest characteristic time @xmath34",
    "however , the cutoff frequency on the spin inertia effect is still determined by the spin lifetime @xmath10 , which originates from the @xmath0 time . due to",
    "the hyperfine fields the initial spin @xmath114 in eq .",
    "depends on the sum of the external magnetic field and the hyperfine field averaged over the realizations of randomly oriented nuclear fields ( see ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "we interpret the decrease of the pr amplitude for increasing modulation frequency , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) and [ fig:3](a ) , as a decrease of the electron spin polarization due to the spin inertia effect .",
    "the red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) are fits to the data according to eq .   for sample  # 1 .",
    "from these fits we obtain spin lifetimes of @xmath125 and 1.0@xmath126s for low and high pump density , respectively .",
    "the pump density dependence of @xmath62 is described by eq .  .",
    "keeping in mind that @xmath78 , one sees that for vanishing pump rates @xmath79 the term @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "in fact , the spin relaxation time of donor - bound electrons is weakly dependent on the donor concentration , which is not very surprising keeping in mind the strong localizing potential of the fluorine donors in znse and that the highest donor concentration we examine is approximately @xmath23  @xmath22 , i.e. the average distance between neighboring donors is about 10 nm .    the evaluated spin relaxation time @xmath4 in dependence on the magnetic field is shown in fig .",

    "furthermore , the results presented in figs .  [ fig:4](a ) and",
    "[ fig:4](c ) let us conclude that the spin lifetime @xmath10 and , correspondingly , the spin relaxation time @xmath4 do not depend on @xmath24 in the whole range from zero up to 2.5  t. note , that this is a rather unexpected result as commonly the carrier spin relaxation time is sensitive to the application of magnetic fields .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] demonstrates another surprising observation , namely that the spin relaxation time does not depend on the temperature in the range from 1.8 to 45  k. we will discuss in sec .",

    "let us turn to the results recorded for cw pump , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](a ) . here",
    "the spin polarization of donor - bound electrons is reduced in transverse magnetic field @xmath25 , showing the known behavior for the hanle effect .",
    "the common interpretation of the hanle effect , when only an external magnetic field acts on the electron spin , is as follows .",
    "the external field @xmath25 induces larmor precession of the electron spins around the magnetic field direction ( @xmath135-axis ) .",
    "the frequency of this precession is given by @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "for relatively strong magnetic fields , for which the spin lifetime @xmath62 is long compared to the time scale determined by @xmath137 , the electron spins perform many revolutions during their lifetime .",
    "this precession reduces the projection of the spins on the initial direction ( @xmath85-axis ) .",
    "the behavior is described by a lorentz curve ( the hanle curve , see eq .",
    "( 50 ) in ref .",
    "@xmath138 here @xmath139 is the characteristic field corresponding to the hwhm of the hanle curve .    for localized electrons in semiconductors , the hyperfine fields of the nuclear spin fluctuations can also contribute to the hanle curve . in the limit of a long dwell time of the electrons on the donors",
    "@xmath140 the half width of the hanle curve will be controlled by the hyperfine field , @xmath141 , and the respective time is the spin dephasing time @xmath142 . here",
    "@xmath143 is the correlation time of an electron and a donor . using eq . to fit the experimental data by fig .",
    "[ fig:6](a ) we determine @xmath75  mt . in combination with @xmath144 for the donor - bound electron",
    "we obtain @xmath145 .",
    "alternatively , information on @xmath34 can be obtained from the pr data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) .",
    "the observed increase of the electron spin polarization for higher magnetic fields can be interpreted as a suppression of the influence of the nuclear spin fluctuations by the external magnetic field .",
    "the width of the observed dip of the pr curve can be used as a direct measure of these fluctuations , which are characterized by an average hyperfine nuclear field @xmath146",
    "the respective field dependence of the pr amplitude can be described by @xmath147 , \\label{e8a}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 is the kerr rotation angle , and @xmath149 is its value at zero magnetic field .",
    "the fit to the pr data with eq .   shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) yields @xmath150  mt . from this value one calculates @xmath34 according to the following equation @xcite : @xmath151 this calculation yields @xmath152 , which is in good agreement with the dephasing time evaluated from the hanle curve .",
    "additional arguments for the validity of our interpretation come from the comparison of the rsa and pr signals measured under the same experimental conditions , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) . there",
    "the pr amplitude ( c ) and the rsa peak amplitude at zero magnetic field ( d ) exhibit a ratio of about 2:1 .",
    "this ratio is in good agreement with the conclusions of ref .",
    "the kerr rotation signal is a direct measure of the spin polarization along the direction of observation ( @xmath85-axis ) . for weak or zero external magnetic fields the components of the nuclear field @xmath146 oriented perpendicular to the direction of observation ( i.e. , the @xmath135- and @xmath153-components ) depolarize the electron spins , while the components parallel or antiparallel to this axis ( @xmath85-component ) do not alter the spin polarization . due to the isotropic nature of the nuclear fluctuations each of these three components of @xmath146 has equal strength or probability , so that the spin polarization of the electron interacting with @xmath146 is reduced to one third of its maximum value at zero external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "in this section we compare the characteristic times of the electron spin dynamics determined by the various techniques and discuss the spin relaxation mechanisms which can describe the measured properties of electron spins bound to fluorine donors in znse . comparing the results of the different techniques we find that @xmath154 , i.e. the characteristic time determined from the hanle curve @xmath34 and the irreversible spin relaxation time @xmath4 determined from the spin inertia method strongly differ .",
    "this can be explained by broadening of the hanle curve by the nuclear spin fluctuations : the strongly localized , donor - bound electrons in the fluorine - doped znse epilayers interact with the nuclear hyperfine field of the same nuclei for a long time ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the resulting larmor precession in the nuclear hyperfine field broadens the hanle curve , so that the spin lifetime @xmath10 obtained from the hanle measurement is limited by this reversible effect and much shorter than the time for the irreversible spin relaxation @xmath4 determined from the spin inertia method .",
    "every mechanism of irreversible spin relaxation can be interpreted as the effect of temporally fluctuating magnetic fields on the electron spin .",
    ".   is valid in the case of short correlation times of the random magnetic field @xmath156 , when dynamical averaging takes place . in a strong magnetic field",
    "the relaxation times of the longitudinal and transverse components @xmath0 and @xmath157 are different .",
    "the time @xmath0 describes the decay of the spin component along the magnetic field .",
    "this time can depend considerably on the magnetic field , since the spin - flip requires the transfer of the energy @xmath158 to the lattice . on the contrary",
    ", the time @xmath157 describes the decoherence time , which is not related to energy transfer to the lattice .",
    "they become equal to each other @xmath159 in a weak magnetic field  @xcite . the spin relaxation time @xmath4 that we determine with the spin inertia method with the magnetic field applied in faraday geometry",
    "is the @xmath160 time .    for sufficiently strong longitudinal magnetic fields one would expect a dependence of the spin relaxation time on the magnetic field",
    "however , we do not observe any dependence of @xmath4 on the magnetic field from zero up to 2.5 t for the donor - bound electrons and only small variations within the accuracy of our method in the temperature range from 1.8 up to 45  k. this imposes severe restrictions on the fluctuating magnetic fields , which can be used to describe the spin relaxation process .",
    "calculating the zeeman splitting of the electron states at an external magnetic field of @xmath161 t we can deduce that the fluctuations of the random magnetic field describing the underlying relaxation mechanism must have a wide frequency range @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the correlation time of the corresponding fluctuating field must be shorter than 3 ps .",
    "the following , almost instantaneous processes can be considered : ( i ) scattering between free and donor - bound electrons ( the exchange interaction between the electrons is responsible for the electron spin flip ) , ( ii ) jumping of electrons between different donors ( hyperfine and spin - orbit interaction ) , ( iii ) scattering of phonons by donor - bound electrons ( spin - orbit interaction ) , and ( iv ) charge fluctuations in the environment of the donors ( spin - orbit interaction ) . all of them will be discussed in the following .    the process ( i ) is unlikely , because the localized states are excited resonantly and the donor ionization process should depend on temperature in the range from 30 to 50 k , which does no reflect the experimental observations .",
    "the process ( ii ) can be provided by two mechanisms : electron spin flip - flop transitions , which are induced by the scalar exchange interaction between electrons on neighboring donors , and electron jumps of donor - bound electrons to unoccupied donors .",
    "calculations according to ref .",
    "@xcite for the parameters of the fluorine donor in znse yield a jump time much longer than the estimated 3 ps .",
    "thus , we discard option ( ii ) as a possible mechanism .",
    "we also discard the process ( iii ) , since we do not observe any temperature dependence of the spin relaxation time @xmath4 , which we would expect for a phonon - mediated process .",
    "the only possible mechanism left is the process ( iv ) - charge fluctuations in the environment of the donors , which e.g. might occur during the 1.5 ps duration of the laser pulse illumination .",
    "we test this possibility by changing the pulsed pump beam to cw excitation .",
    "however , the determined spin relaxation time still does not depend on magnetic field or on temperature in the specified range .",
    "according to this check we can exclude a direct influence of the pulsed excitation on the spin relaxation .",
    "however , we can not completely disregard any illumination induced mechanism , as charge fluctuations can be produced also by cw laser excitation in combination with carrier recombination during tens of picoseconds  @xcite .",
    "still , there is no clear evidence for this so that we suggest that there may be a different , new mechanism , which determines the spin relaxation time in this system with strong electron localization .",
    "we have suggested a method based on the spin inertia effect to measure the longitudinal spin relaxations time @xmath0 of carriers .",
    "it exploits optical orientation of the carrier spins and their polarization recovery in magnetic field in the faraday geometry , measured for different modulation frequencies of the laser helicity .",
    "the validity of this method is demonstrated for electrons bound to fluorine donors in znse .",
    "an electron spin relaxation time of @xmath163  @xmath1s is measured for sample # 1 in the temperature range @xmath2  k. this time remains constant for magnetic fields varied from zero to 2.5  t and depends only weakly on the donor concentration .",
    "measurements of the spin dephasing time @xmath164  ns by the rsa and hanle techniques , and comparison of pulsed and continuous - wave excitation allow us to conclude that the spin relaxation of the donor - bound electrons is caused by perturbations that cover a broad spectral range . the question about the origin of this perturbation has remained open so far and needs further investigations .",
    "the obvious advantage of the suggested polarization recovery technique based on the spin inertia effect is that it is suitable for measuring the longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath0 in the whole range of magnetic fields starting from zero field .",
    "contributions of different spin relaxation mechanisms may be distinguished by their different onsets in the modulation frequency dependence .",
    "this distinction is possible when the generated carrier spin polarization is not fully destroyed by a faster relaxation mechanism .",
    "a requirement for the suggested technique is the finite optical orientation of carriers ( at least of about few percent that can be comfortably detected ) .",
    "the photoinduced carrier spin polarization can be detected by various methods , e.g. by kerr or faraday rotation or by the circular polarization degree of photoluminescence .",
    "the main limitation of the technique comes from the condition that the pump helicity modulation period shall be tuned to a time shorter than the spin lifetime @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the technique can be applied well for measuring long relaxation times , e.g. of resident carriers , but it is less suited for fast decaying excitons , for example , whose typical recombination time is shorter than a nanosecond , as it would require a modulation frequency exceeding 1  ghz .    *",
