    "different particles have different neighborhoods and consequently different dynamics .",

    "the most striking observation is the spread in the data which strongly increases with increasing temperature .",
    "whereas for @xmath2 the @xmath0 of the 5% fastest particles is approximately five times the @xmath3 of the 5% slowest particles , this grows to a factor of approximately fifty close to the glass transition temperature .",
    "thus , heterogeneities are present in the glassy state for all temperatures and become increasingly more pronounced as the glass transition temperature is approached from below .",
    "our goal is to characterize these heterogeneities quantitatively .",
    "obviously the mean of the vibrational amplitudes is not conclusive and we therefore investigate instead the full distribution of vibrational amplitudes to characterize the local dynamics .",
    "we compute this distribution and show that , in the vicinity of the glass transition , it approximately obeys scaling .",
    "we furthermore compare it to a mean field calculation for a different amorphous solid @xcite , the gel , and find surprisingly good agreement .    to further characterize dynamic as well as time persistent heterogeneities we use various definitions to identify mobile and immobile particles .",
    "we identify clusters of immobile and mobile particles where particles are defined to be connected if their relative distance is smaller than the position of the first minimum of the pair correlation function . to quantify the shape of these clusters",

    "we determine the average size of the clusters , the average coordination number and the spatial extent as measured by the radius of gyration .",

    "ix of @xcite we equilibrate the system at constant temperature @xmath26 to obtain ten independent configurations which are at least @xmath27 time units apart . the temperature is kept constant by replacing the velocities of all particles by new velocities drawn from the corresponding boltzmann distribution every 50 time steps .",

    "we study heterogeneities below the glass transition and focus on how the particles are increasingly frozen in as the temperature is lowered . even though the system is obviously very inhomogeneous ( see sec .",

    "one possibility is to study the extremes , the most mobile and the most immobile particles . in most of this paper",
    "we concentrate on the immobile ones ; we study their organization into clusters and the size and shape of these clusters .    using four different definitions of immobility we are able to test if the resulting dynamical behavior is dependent on the precise definition of immobility . for two of the definitions we characterize the mobility of a particle by its vibrational amplitude @xcite @xmath44 where the bar denotes a time average over the whole simulation run .",
    "our first definition of immobility ( i ) defines every particle @xmath5 to be immobile for which @xmath45 the second definition of immobility ( ii ) @xcite identifies as immobile particles a fixed percentage of a particles and separately a fixed percentage of b particles with the smallest @xmath46 .",
    "this allows us to similarly study the most mobile particles with the largest @xmath46 .",

    "the smallest cutoff @xmath53 corresponds to the lindemann criterion and gives rise to significant deviations in the results for @xmath51 as compared to the other definitions of immobility .",
    "apparently the frozen structure can be sustained with a considerable fraction of particles whose vibrational amplitude is larger than suggested by the lindemann criterion , e.g. roughly @xmath57 of the a - particles at @xmath58 .",
    "this is consistent with the broad scatter of vibrational amplitudes in the glassy phase that we shall discuss below .",
    "the qualitative behavior is the same for all definitions of immobility and in particular the temperature where @xmath56 goes to zero is rather insensitive to the details of the definition of immobile particles ( unless the cutoff is chosen too small , see above ) .",
    "hence @xmath56 serves as a good indicator for @xmath59 .",
    "similarly the history of the simulation runs has a quantitative influence on @xmath51 : larger initial temperature ( @xmath31 ) results in fewer immobile particles , consistent with fig .  22 of @xcite . the qualitative behavior , however , is not only independent of the precise definition of immobility but also independent of the history of the simulations runs .",

    "<S> the distribution of vibrational amplitudes obeys scaling and compares reasonably well with a mean field theory for the amorphous solid state . to investigate correlations among the immobile and mobile particles we identify clusters and analyze their size and shape . for a fixed number of immobile particles we observe that the immobile particles cluster </S>",

    "<S> the clustering is most pronounced at small temperatures , indicating that mobility at low temperatures can only be sustained in cooperative motion . </S>"
