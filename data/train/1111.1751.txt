    "though numerical calculations , including the pebble game @xcite , have provided much of our knowledge about the properties of random elastic networks , effective medium theories ( emts ) @xcite have provided complementary analytical descriptions of cf networks that are simple and at minimum qualitatively correct .",

    "this lattice has bending and stretching forces modeled on those of biopolymer networks of filamentous semi - flexible polymers , characterized by one - dimensional stretching and bending moduli @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , respectively .",

    "when diluted , it exhibits a second - order rigidity transition from a state with bending - dominated nonaffine shear response to a state with no rigidity .",
    "as dilution decreases , rigidity is still controlled by @xmath10 , but response becomes less nonaffine .",
    "filamentous networks in two - dimensions are often described by the mikado model @xcite in which semi - flexible filaments of a given length @xmath42 are deposited with random center - of - mass position and random orientation on a two - dimensional plane and in which the points where two filaments cross are joined in frictionless crosslinks . as in our model",
    ", there is no energy cost for the relative rotation of two rods about a crosslink , but there is an energy cost for bending the rods at crosslinks .",

    "all filaments traverse the sample , and the system has finite , @xmath10-independent shear and bulk moduli : there is effectively a cf rigidity transition at @xmath47 when @xmath48 is decreased from infinity .",
    "there is a transition at @xmath49 from a floppy to a rigid state with nonaffine response  @xcite , and there is a wide crossover region between @xmath50 and @xmath51 in which the shear modulus changes from being bend dominated , nonaffine , and nearly independent of @xmath9 at small @xmath48 to being stretch dominated , nearly affine , and nearly independent of @xmath10 at large @xmath48 .",
    "our emt applied to the kagome lattice @xcite , whose maximum coordination number like that of the mikado model is four , captures these crossovers .",
    "interestingly , @xmath52 lattices composed of straight filaments with @xmath53 exhibit similar behavior  @xcite . when filaments are bent , however , elastic response in one case at least @xcite is more like that of the diluted diamond lattice with the shear modulus vanishing with @xmath10 even at at large @xmath54 or @xmath3 near @xmath55 .    external tensile stress ( i.e. , negative pressure ) can cause a floppy lattice to become rigid @xcite .",
    "random internal stresses can do so as well in a phenomenon called tensegrity @xcite .",
    "thus a lattice with internal stresses may have a lower rigidity threshold than the same lattice with out internal stresses @xcite .",
    "systems such as network glasses can exhibit two rigidity transitions @xcite : a second - order transition from a floppy to a rigid but unstressed state followed closely by a first - order transition to a rigid but stressed state .",

    "the derivation of the discretized stretching energy is straightforward : associated with each node @xmath68 is a longitudinal displacement @xmath79 and with each bond @xmath68 an energy @xmath80 the total stretching energy of a filament is the sum of these bond energies .",
    "the discretized equations of motion arising from this inhomogeneous discrete model agree with those arising from a continuum model in the continuum @xmath81 limit .",

    "<S> we present an effective medium theory that includes bending as well as stretching forces , and we use it to calculate mechanical response of a diluted filamentous triangular lattice . in this lattice , bonds are central - force springs , and there are bending forces between neighboring bonds on the same filament . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the diluted lattice in which each bond is present with a probability @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a rigidity threshold @xmath1 which has the same value for all positive bending rigidity and a crossover characterizing bending- , stretching- , and bend - stretch coupled elastic regimes controlled by the central - force rigidity percolation point at @xmath2 of the lattice when fiber bending rigidity vanishes . </S>"
