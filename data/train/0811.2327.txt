    "many recent studies on the stellar population in the vicinity of active galactic nuclei ( hereafter agn ) report an excess of young to intermediate age stars in the inner few hundred parsecs when compared to non - active galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this excess supports the existence of the so - called agn - starburst connection @xcite , which can be understood as due to the fact that both circumnuclear star formation and nuclear activity feed on gas inflowing towards the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "the gas infllow , if massive enough , in its way to the centre , may trigger circumnuclear star formation , and , reaching the nucleus , also the nuclear activity . alternatively , there may be a delay in the triggering of the nuclear activity , which would be fed via mass loss from the evolving stars . the agn - starburst connection is consistent and somewhat expected within the presently favored scenario of co - evolution of galaxies and their nuclear supermassive black holes ( smbh ) , supported by the m@xmath18 relation @xcite : if the bulge grows via the formation of new stars ( starbursts ) , and the smbh grows via mass accretion from its surroundings , one could expect a relation between the nuclear mass accretion rate and the star - formation rate in circumnuclear starbursts .",
    "the mechanism through which the gas makes its way from the circumnuclear regions of star formation  which in many cases have a ring - like morphology  to the agn are nevertheless still elusive . in @xcite , using optical images obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) of the inner few hundred parsecs of both active and non - active galaxies , the authors concluded that there is a strong correlation between the presence of dusty structures ( spirals and filaments ) and nuclear activity in early - type galaxies , proposing that these structures trace the material in its way in to feed the active nucleus .",
    "recently , this was shown to be the case for at least two low - activity agn with circumnuclear rings of star - formation : ngc1097 @xcite and ngc6951 @xcite . in these two galaxies ,",
    "the authors have observed streaming motions along nuclear spirals in the h@xmath19 emitting gas .",
    "another similar case is the seyfert galaxy ngc4051 where @xcite found streaming motions along a nuclear spiral in molecular gas emitting the h@xmath202.1218@xmath15 m line .",
    "inflows towards agn are difficult to observe , particularly in ionized gas , due the predominance of emission from outflowing gas in the vicinity of the active nucleus .",
    "the inflow probably occurs mostly in `` cold '' gas , while the outflows are seen in ionized gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies aimed to investigate the kinematics and flux distributions of the molecular and ionized gas in the near - infrared ( hereafter near - ir ) bands indeed reveal that the h@xmath17 emitting gas usually has a distinct kinematics and distribution from that of the ionized gas .",
    "the h@xmath17 kinematics seems to be `` colder '' and , together with the flux distribution , suggest that the molecular gas is more restricted to the galactic plane , while the ionized gas seems to extend to higher galactic latitudes and has a `` hotter '' kinematics @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that the feeding of agn is dominated by inflow of cold molecular gas , while the ionized gas constributes mostly to its feedback via the outflows .",
    "this work is aimed at investigating the relation between circumnuclear star formation and nuclear activity , as well as to look for the mechanisms of feeding and feedback in the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc7582 , which has a hubble type sbab and has a distance of 21.6mpc ( for @xmath21 from @xcite , with 1@xmath220 corresponding to @xmath3  105pc at the galaxy , adopting @xmath23 ) .",
    "this galaxy is an ideal candidate for this study because it has both circumnuclear star formation @xcite and a nuclear outflow observed by @xcite using the taurus fabry - perot spectrometer .",
    "the outflows , observed in the [ oiii ] emission line are oriented approximately perpendicular to the galactic plane , with velocities of up to @xmath24 , and are co - spatial with an ionization cone observed in an [ oiii]@xmath25 narrow band image @xcite .",
    "besides mapping the [ oiii ] outflow , @xcite also reported the presence of a kpc - scale rotating disc in the plane of the galaxy , observed in h@xmath19 . @xcite",
    "have studied the star formation in the circumnuclear disc using [ neii]12.8@xmath15 m narrow band images , and report the presence of embedded star clusters claiming that there are no counterparts detected at optical or near - ir wavelengths .",
    "they calculate the mass of the smbh as 5.5@xmath110@xmath26m@xmath5 using high resolution mid infrared spectroscopy .",
    "we use k - band spectroscopic observations obtained with the integral field unit ( ifu ) of the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) to map the stellar and gaseous flux distributions and kinematics of the inner few hundred parsecs of ngc7582 .",
    "the k - band spectra allow the mapping of the stellar kinematics via the co@xmath272.3@xmath15 m absorption feature , the ionized gas flux distribution and kinematics via the br@xmath7 emission line and the molecular gas flux distribution and kinematics via the h@xmath17 emission lines .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    "we present the two - dimensional flux distributions and kinematics for both the emitting gas and stars .",
    "the results are discussed in section 4 , and in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "the data were obtained at the gemini south telescope with the gnirs ifu @xcite in 2005 nov 10 as part of program gs-2005b - q-65 , and comprise four individual exposures of 900s centred at @xmath27=2.24@xmath15 m . the 111 l / mm grating with the short blue camera ( 0@xmath2215/pixel ) was used , resulting in a nominal resolving power of r=5900 .",
    "the gnirs ifu has a rectangular field of view , of approximately 3@xmath222@xmath14@xmath228 , divided into 21 slices . at the detector ,",
    "the slices are divided along their length into 0@xmath2215 square ifu elements . the major axis of the ifu was oriented along position angle pa=203@xmath28 , in order to partially cover the ionization cone observed in the [ oiii]@xmath29 narrow - band image by @xcite .",
    "two sets of observations were obtained , one centred at 1@xmath222 from the nucleus along pa=23@xmath28 and another centred at 0@xmath2275 from the nucleus along pa=203@xmath28 , the small offset being required to fill in the gaps between the slices .",
    "the observing procedure followed the standard object ",
    "sky  sky ",
    "object dither sequence , with off - source sky positions since the target is extended .",
    "conditions during the observations were stable and clear , with image quality in @xmath30-band , in the range 0@xmath2245 - 0@xmath2255 , as obtained for the full width at half maximuum ( fwhm ) of the stellar profiles .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution , measured from the fwhm or the emission lines of the arc calibrations is @xmath32.9 .",
    "the data reduction was accomplished using tasks in the gemini.gnirs iraf package as well as generic iraf tasks .",
    "the reduction procedure included trimming of the images , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength calibration and s - distortion correction .",
    "the telluric bands were removed and the frames flux calibrated by interpolating a black body function to the spectrum of the telluric standard star , observed immediatelly after the galaxy .",
    "the final ifu datacube contains 840 spectra covering the spectral range from 2.14@xmath31 m to 2.33@xmath31 m , each spectrum corresponding to an angular coverage of 0@xmath2215@xmath10@xmath2215 , which translates to 16@xmath116pc@xmath2 at the galaxy .",
    "the total observed field of view 6@xmath223@xmath13@xmath220 ( obtained by mosaicing the two set of observations ) corresponds to a region of projected dimensions 660pc@xmath1315pc at the galaxy .",
    "in the top - left panel of figure[large ] we present a large scale optical @xmath32-band image of ngc7582 from @xcite , obtained with the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 1.5 m telescope .",
    "the top - right panel presents a continuum image observed with the hst wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) using the filter f606w obtained from the hst archive ( program 8597  pi : regan , m. ) .",
    "we have overlaid on the hst image the contours ( in green ) of the narrow - band [ oiii]@xmath29 image from @xcite , which maps the ionization cone .",

    "these clusters delineate an elongated ring of recent star formation , with semi - major axis of @xmath33 , which was almost entirely covered by our observations .    in the bottom - left panel ,",

    "centred on the location corresponding to the peak flux in the continuum ( position n in the br@xmath7 intensity map ) , and spectra from two locations at 17 nw ( position a ) , and at 17 se of the nucleus ( position b ) , located in the star - forming ring .",
    "the spectra of the latter regions present emission lines of br@xmath35 m , h@xmath36 m and h@xmath37 m , used to map the gaseous kinematics and flux distributions , and the stellar absorption band of @xmath38co(2,0)@xmath39 m , used to obtain the stellar kinematics .",
    "the nuclear spectrum is redder than those from the ring , with a flux in the continuum 10@xmath4015 times higher than in the ring , and shows a narrow br@xmath7 emission line , on the top of what seems to be a broad component of the line .",

    "the magenta filled circles indicate the position of the embedded star clusters observed by @xcite .",
    "the black circles surrounding the nucleus in the br@xmath7 flux map represent the apertures used to extract the spectra shown in fig.[fitting ] and the green dashed lines show the orientation of the pseudo - slits used to construct one - dimensional cuts shown in fig.[cut ] . ]    flux distributions in the emission lines were obtained directly from the datacube by integrating the flux under each emission - line profile and subtracting the continuum contribution using images obtained in windows adjacent to the emission line .",
    "we have also adjusted gaussian profiles to the emission lines in order to measure the gas radial velocity ( from the central wavelength of the line ) and velocity dispersion ( from the width of the line ) .",
    "the fitting of each emission - line profile was obtained using the splot iraf task , and resulted also in an integrated flux for each line , from which we also obtained flux distributions .",
    "a comparison of the flux distributions obtained via the fitting of gaussians to the flux distributions obtained directly from the datacube showed that , although both flux distributions agree with each other within the uncertainties , the ones obtained via gaussian fitting are less noisy away from the nucleus .",
    "these flux distributions are shown in figure[flux ] for the br@xmath7 ( top panel ) and h@xmath36 m ( middle panel ) emission lines with mean uncertainties of 6% and 11% , respectively .",
    "the br@xmath7 emission is extended along the major axis of the galaxy ( pa@xmath42 ) and show flux enhancements in an arc shaped structure which approximately trace the star clusters observed by @xcite , shown again by the magenta circles .",
    "two strong br@xmath7 emission peaks in the ring are located at @xmath33nw and @xmath33se of the nucleus , and are encircled by the green contours in fig.[flux ] which correspond to the limits within which the flux in each pixel is higher than 50% of the peak flux in the region .",
    "we note that each of our encircled regions include two of the clusters identified by @xcite . while the br@xmath7 flux distribution show intensity variations and enhacements in the position corresponding to the star clusters , mapping the ring of star - formation , the h@xmath17 flux distribution ( middle panel of fig.[flux ] ) is more uniform througouth the nuclear region , showing no enhancements at the star clusters .",
    "the black regions correspond to pixels for which the s / n ratio was too low to allow a reliable measurement of the emission line .",
    "the bottom panel of figure[flux ] shows the @xmath41 m continuum image obtained from interpolation between two continuum windows adjacent to the br@xmath7 profile .",
    "the iso - intensity contours in the continuum image are assymetric , being more extended to the w ",

    "the observed spectra are shown in black , the fitted template in red and the residuals in green.,title=\"fig : \" ]        in order to obtain the stellar line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) we fitted the @xmath38co(2,0 ) stellar absorption bandhead at 2.2935@xmath15 m in the @xmath30-band spectra using the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite .",
    "the algorithm finds the best fit to a galaxy spectrum by convolving template stellar spectra with a given losvd .",
    "this procedure outputs the stellar radial velocity , velocity dispersion and higher - order gauss - hermite moments for each spectrum fitted .",
    "the ppxf method allows the use of several stellar templates , and also to vary the relative contribution of the different templates to obtain the best fit , thus minimizing the problem of template mismatch . for this study , we have selected as template spectra those of the gemini spectroscopic library of late spectral type stars observed with the gnirs ifu using the grating 111 l / mm in the _ k_-band @xcite . in @xcite , we describe some properties of this library and discuss the problem of template mismatch using the co absorption bandheads with the ppxf method .    in figure[fit ]",
    "we show the resulting fit for positions a ( top ) and b ( bottom ) marked in fig.[large ] .",
    "for the regions where the signal - to - noise ( hereafter s / n ) ratio was lower than @xmath43 we replaced the spectrum of each single pixel by an average including the 9 nearest pixels . even adopting this procedure , we could obtain measurements of the stellar kinematics only for the central @xmath44 region , as the s / n ratio of the spectra close to the borders of the ifu field becomes too low to obtain a reliable fit .",
    "for this same reason , we could not obtain stellar kinematic measurements also very close to the nucleus ( radius@xmath4503 ) , as the co bandhead feature becomes diluted by dust and line emission .    in figure[stel ] we present 2d maps of the stellar kinematics .",
    "black pixels in this figure correspond to the masked regions where we did not obtain a reliable fit .",

    "although the are similarities between the velocity fields observed for h@xmath17 and br@xmath7 , there are also differences in the detailed kinematics for the two gas phases , as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the small but systematic excess blueshift in the h@xmath17 emitting gas along pa@xmath178 , suggests there could be an inflow of molecular gas along a nuclear bar , as discussed above .",

    "[ slices_br ] and [ slices_h2 ] also support a larger contribution from outflowing gas to the br@xmath7 than to the h@xmath17 emission , since the blueshifted emission in br@xmath7 reaches larger velocity values and is found farther away from the line of nodes than in the h@xmath17 emitting gas .",
    "previous studies have also found that the h@xmath17 traces less disturbed kinematics than the ionized gas in the circumnuclear region of seyfert galaxies @xcite , leading to the suggestion that the molecular gas , orbiting in the plane , traces the feeding of the active nucleus via inflow of cold gas , while the ionized gas traces its feedback via the outflows . in @xcite",
    "we could trace streaming motions in the h@xmath17 emitting gas towards the nucleus along a nuclear spiral arm . in the present observations ,",
    "there is also some evidence of inflow along a nuclear bar .",
    "the compactness and high inclination of the circumnuclear ring of star - formation does not favor the detection of possible additional streaming motions between the ring and the nucleus .",
    "the h@xmath17 flux distribution shows that the molecular gas is not concentrated in the star - forming ring , but is distributed over the whole nuclear region , indicating the presence of similar density of molecular gas at the ring and between the nucleus and the ring",
    ". this molecular gas could be the material which is feeding and probably will continue to feed the active nucleus for some time in the future .      the total mass of hot h@xmath17 in the nuclear region of ngc7582 can be estimated as @xcite : @xmath181 where we assume a vibrational temperature of @xmath182k , which implies a population fraction @xmath183 @xcite , and a transition probability @xmath184s@xmath10 @xcite . integrating the flux of the h@xmath185 m emission line over the wole ifu field we obtain @xmath186 and thus @xmath187 .",
    "the above value is the mass of hot h@xmath17 emitting gas , which is probably only the `` hot skin '' of the molecular gas available in the nuclear region to feed the active nucleus .",
    "the total mass of molecular gas should be much higher , as it should be dominated by cold gas , which has been estimated to be 10@xmath188 to 10@xmath189 times that of the hot gas in galaxies for which both hot and cold molecular gas have been observed @xcite .",
    "thus , there should be plenty of molecular gas , not only to feed the agn but also to give origin to the recent bursts of star - formation in the ring .",
    "the molecular gas accumulated in the nuclear region was probably the fuel which gave origin to the nuclear ring of star formation , as well as to the present episode of nuclear activity .",
    "although both the star formation and nuclear activity could have been triggered simultaneously , there is also the possibility that the star formation was triggered first , and then the mass loss from stellar winds and supernova explosions in the cnsfrs have been the source of fuel for the smbh .",
    "it is thus instructive to estimate the available mass to feed the smbh under the above assumption . for solar metallicity and an age of 5myr ,",
    "the total mass loss for the two cnsfrs is in the range @xmath310@xmath190m@xmath5 @xcite . assuming a value of 10@xmath191m@xmath5 , and that the duration of this process is a few 10@xmath192yr",

    "this timescale alows for the coexistence of the nuclear activity and star - forming regions of 5myr under the hypothesis that the nuclear activity has been triggered by mass accretion originated from mass loss of young stars formed in the circumnuclear ring .",
    "alternatively , the triggering may have happened during a previous burst of star - formation in the ring .",
    "the presence of such previous starburst is supported by the partial ring of low @xmath50 observed in the stellar kinematics .",
    "in addition , as pointed out in sec.[nuclear ] , the extranuclear spectrum does not differ significantly from those of the star - forming ring , suggesting that there may be regions of recent star formation even closer to the nucleus , which may be contributing to the smbh feeding as well .",
    "finally , we quantify the agn - starburst connection in ngc7582 by comparing the mass accretion rate to the smbh with the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the circumnuclear region .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the m@xmath18 relation implies that the mass of the smbh in galaxies grows in proportion to the growth of the bulge .",
    "if the bulge grows via star formation episodes , the mass accretion rate to the smbh should be proportional to the sfr . which should be the ratio between the mass accretion rate and the sfr ?",
    "the same as the between the mass of the smbh and the mass of the host galaxy bulge , which was first obtained by @xcite , and today known as the magorrian relation @xcite , which has been revised to a ratio of 0.1% between the mass of the smbh and that of the bulge .",
    "assuming that the total sfr can be represented by that of the ring , we get for ngc7582 a ratio of 0.26% between the mass accretion rate and the sfr , a number which is close to that of the magorrian relation , considering the uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties include , in particular , a possible underestimate of the sfr in the nuclear region , as our observation misses the top border of the star - forming ring , and a possible contribution of a starburst included within the nuclear aperture .",
    "two - dimensional near - ir @xmath0band spectroscopy from the inner 660@xmath1315pc@xmath2 of the seyfert galaxy ngc7582 , obtained with the gemini gnirs ifu at a spatial resolution of @xmath195pc@xmath2 and spectral resolution of @xmath33 , was used to map the molecular and ionized gas emission - line flux distributions and kinematics as well as the stellar kinematics .",

    ", it can be concluded that the total mass of h@xmath17 gas ( which is dominated by cold h@xmath17 ) can be 10@xmath19810@xmath26 times larger . *",
    "the stellar velocity field shows a distorted rotation pattern whose centre appears to be displaced up to 50pc from the nucleus ( identified as the peak of the continuum emission ) .",
    "the distortion could be associated to a nuclear bar and a nuclear spiral previously seen in mid - infrared images .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the bulge is @xmath138 , implying in a mass of @xmath199 for the smbh , in good agreement with previous determinations .",
    "immersed in this bulge , there is a partial ring of lower @xmath50 ( @xmath52 ) , which is close to the star - forming ring but displaced @xmath350pc inwards .",
    "as the velocity dispersion is similar to that of the molecular gas , this ring can be interpreted as due to stars recently formed from cold gas , although in a previous burst ( age@xmath1210@xmath26yr ) , still keeping the gas kinematics as they did not have time yet to `` thermalize '' with the stars of the bulge .",
    "* the radial velocity field of the ionized gas is similar to that of the stellar component to the n  nw , while to the s  sw there is an additional blueshifted component ( @xmath200kms@xmath10 ) , which we attribute to outflows along the ionization cone ( previously observed in a narrow - band [ oiii ] image ) which is partially covered by our observations .",
    "velocity channel maps along the br@xmath7 emission - line profile show even higher blueshifts , reaching @xmath201kms@xmath10 in the outflow , while the maximum redshift observed is @xmath202kms@xmath10 .",
    "the velocity dispersion is enhanced in the region of the outflow . * the mass outflow rate in the ionized gas",
    "is estimated to be @xmath13 , which is an order of magnitude larger than the accretion rate to feed the agn , a ratio which is similar to those found in other agn .",
    "this large ratio indicates that the outflowing gas does not originate in the agn , but is instead the circumnuclear gas from the host galaxy being pushed away by a nuclear outflow . *",
    "the kinematics of the hot molecular gas , traced by the h@xmath17 emission , shows smaller blueshifts along the outflow as well as lower velocity dispersions , which suggests that most of the molecular gas is in the galactic plane .",
    "an excess blueshift along pa@xmath16 , where a nuclear bar has been observed , can be interpreted as an inflow towards the nucleus .",
    "we thus conclude that the h@xmath17 kinematics traces the feeding of the agn , while the ionized gas kinematics traces its feedback via the outflows .",
    "* the estimated mass loss rate from the evolving stars in the circumnuclear ring is @xmath203m@xmath5yr@xmath10 , which is @xmath35 times the nuclear accretion rate .",
    "as the estimated time for this mass to reach the nucleus is a few 10@xmath192yr , this material could be the fuel which just triggered the nuclear activity . nevertheless ,",
    "as there is also a previous burst of star formation almost co - spatial with the ring , the fuel may have been available previously ( e.g. @xmath204yr ) .",
    "in addition , previous data suggest that there may be also recent star formation inside the ring , closer to the nucleus . *",
    "we conclude that the agn ",
    "starburst connection in ngc7582 may have occurred in two ways : ( 1 ) there is a large molecular gas reservoir in the nuclear region which gave origin to both the star - formation in the circumnuclear ring and nuclear activity ; ( 2 ) the molecular gas has given origin first to circumnuclear star formation and the mass loss from the evolving stars have then triggered the nuclear activity . *",
    "the ratio between the mass accretion rate and the sfr in the circumnuclear region , of 0.26% is close to the value implied by the magorrian relation between the mass of the smbh and the mass of the bulges of the host galaxies .",
    "this result shows that a growth of the smbh proportional to the growth of the bulge can proceed via circumnuclear star formation around agn .",
