    "the boundedness of @xmath2 on other function spaces is of considerable interest and it has deep connections with the geometry of the domain .",

    "if the operator @xmath2 is bounded on all @xmath9-sobolev spaces @xmath10 for @xmath8 then any biholomoprhic map from a smooth @xmath0 to another smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain extends smoothly to the closure of domains @xcite .",
    "the bergman projection preserves holomorphic functions in @xmath3 and hence the holomorphic @xmath9-sobolev space at each scale .",
    "therefore , one can not expect any gain in the sobolev scale under @xmath2 .",
    "however , in two recent papers @xcite and @xcite the authors have shown that @xmath2 gains derivatives in certain directions on smoothly bounded domains that satisfy condition r. a domain @xmath0 satisfies condition r if @xmath2 maps the space of functions smooth up to the boundary @xmath11 to itself . out of a few different formulations of this gain , we highlight the following version .",

    "this follows from @xmath18 forming an orthonormal basis for @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , not only is @xmath13 smooth up to the boundary , it is , in fact , holomorphic on a larger domain ( actually holomorphic on @xmath1 ) .",
    "this example suggests that @xmath2 may have a further smoothing property and we indeed prove such a result on a family of reinhardt domains .",

    "in contrast to the result of herbig , mcneal , and straube , the above theorem describes a new phenomenon on a different class of domains . even on smooth reinhardt domains which satisfy condition r ( see @xcite )",
    ", our result draws a stronger conclusion . note that on any smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain there exists a holomorphic function that is smooth up to the boundary and",

    "our main tool in proving theorem [ thm : main ] is observing it in the special case of a product of annuli in @xmath1 .",

    "we conclude with some further remarks in the last section .",
    "in this section , we focus on bounded reinhardt domains . let @xmath0 be a bounded reinhardt domain in @xmath26 ; that is , if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then @xmath29 . we denote the hilbert space of square integrable functions with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath30 by @xmath3 .",
    "the subspace of holomorphic functions in @xmath3 is called the bergman space and it is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "it follows from the mean value property of holomorphic functions that @xmath4 is a closed subspace of @xmath3 .",

    "we refer to @xcite for more on the basics of the bergman projection .",
    "originally defined only on @xmath3 , it is known that @xmath2 is a bounded operator on other function spaces under various geometric conditions .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a survey of results on sobolev spaces and to @xcite and the references therein for a sample of results on @xmath5 spaces .",
    "we begin by studying a motivating example - an annulus in @xmath37 .",

    "since , the @xmath9 norms on @xmath67 and @xmath68 agree , the bergman projections on @xmath69 and @xmath70 agree and we have @xmath71 a constant .",
    "the following example of the hartogs triangle , in which the origin is in the closure of the domain , however , presents a much subtler picture . the global version of the main theorem fails to hold whereas the local version holds everywhere except at the origin .",
    "this highlights the importance of the assumption that @xmath21 not intersect the coordinate axes in theorem [ thm : main ] .    [ eg : hartogstri ] consider the hartogs triangle @xmath72 .",
