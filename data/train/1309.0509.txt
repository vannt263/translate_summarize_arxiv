    "in ( * ? ? ? * lwb12 hereafter ) , we carried out source type classifications of 4330 sources from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , which is the largest x - ray source catalog ever produced , containing 353,191 x - ray source detections for 262,902 unique x - ray sources from 4953 pointed observations made by  @xcite .",
    "for about one third of these 4330 sources we obtained reliable source types from the literature .",
    "they mostly correspond to various types of stars , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and compact object ( co ) systems containing white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars ( nss ) , and stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "these sources show different source properties in terms of the x - ray spectral shape , x - ray variability , and the multi - wavelength cross - correlation , based on which we came up with a method to classify the rest of the sources into the above three main categories , i.e. , stars , agns , and compact object systems . in brief , we first identified star candidates as those with low x - ray - to - ir flux ratios and/or frequent x - ray flares and then identified compact object system candidates from the remaining sources as those with properties hardly seen in agns , such as soft x - ray spectra and large long - term variability .",
    "the compact object system candidates identified in this way could inevitably include exotic objects with high science value , such as very soft agns like @xcite and tidal disruption events ( tdes ) , in which stars approaching a supermassive bh ( smbh ) is tidally disrupted and subsequently accreted @xcite .",
    "about 200 strong compact object system candidates were found .",
    "some of them were poorly studied in the literature .",
    "because these objects are important targets for studies of dense matter and accretion physics in extreme environment and they are also a treasure for discovery of objects with high science value , we have planned a series of companion papers on these poorly studied compact object system candidates in order to shed new light on their nature . while the other companion papers focus on single sources ( e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , here we present a relatively large sample ( 18 in total ) , which were selected because they exhibited interesting properties of periodicity , very soft spectra , and/or large long - term variability .",
    "some of their general properties from lwb12 are given in table  [ tbl : dercat ] , including the number of source detections in the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , the number of the  observations , the 0.24.5 kev flux variation ( @xmath8 ) , etc . throughout the paper ,",
    "we generally use the unique source index from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog ( column srcid ) to refer to the sources ( table  [ tbl : dercat ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate primarily on  x - ray observations",
    ". we only present those that best demonstrate the source properties based on considerations of data quality , sampling of spectral states , etc .",
    "some sources are also observed by other x - ray observatories , especially the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( cxo ) .",
    "we mostly refer to the _ chandra _ source catalog ( csc , release 1.1 , * ? ? ? * ) for their behavior as observed with _",
    "chandra _ , except for one observation , which was analyzed to show the period of source # 150140 . in section",
    "[ sec : reduction ] , we describe the analysis of the selected  and _ chandra _ observations of the sources . in section  [ sec : res ] , we present the results and discuss the possible nature of each source .",
    "the conclusions of our study are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . throughout the paper , we assume a flat universe with the hubble constant @xmath9=73 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and the matter density @xmath10=0.27 .",

    "the source has a candidate sdss point - like counterpart ( table  [ tbl : sdssmat ] ) , which appears very red , probably caused by strong absorption .",
    "the maximum 0.310 kev absorbed luminosity would be between 2@xmath84@xmath165 and @xmath7 erg  s@xmath5 if the source distance is within 18.5 kpc . similar to our discussion for source # 165335 above , this source might be a cv , a vfxt with a bh or ns as the accretor , or a star with an extremely energetic stellar flare .",
    "we have studied 18 sources from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog that were poorly studied in the literature but show interesting properties of periodicity , very soft spectra and/or large long - term variability in x - rays in order to investigate their nature .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "two sources have been persistently detected with hard spectra ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "one of them ( source # 150140 ) was detected on the outskirts of the young open cluster ngc 6231 and showed a 1.62 hr periodicity in six  observations and one _ chandra _ observation separated by nearly four years .",
    "there is also a @xmath02.1 hr period candidate in the other source ( # 122979 ) , but it needs to be confirmed with future long observations .",
    "both sources are good magnetic cv candidates .",
    "2 .   seven very soft sources ( @xmath101 kev ) are probably in other galaxies , which would imply the luminosities ranging from about @xmath3 to @xmath4 erg s@xmath5",
    ". some of them might be coincident with galactic nuclei and best explained as ultrasoft agns or tdes , while the others are probably off - nuclear and could be cool thermal disk emission from accreting imbhs or edge - on viewing of optically thick cool outflows from supercritical accretion .",
    "one source ( # 107102 ) is an agn candidate and showed an intermittent qpo at about 3.8 hr , i.e. , in two observations in 2005 december but not in one observation in 2003 july .",
    "3 .   six highly variable sources with spectra harder than the above very soft sources appear in nearby rc3 galaxies and probably have luminosities above @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 , making them great candidates for extragalactic x - ray binaries .",
    "one source ( # 222148 , in m 31 ) has remained x - ray bright and hard in 0.310 kev since it was discovered to enter an outburst on 2007 july 31 and thus is probably a new - born persistent source .",
    "three highly variable hard sources appear at low galactic latitudes and have maximum luminosities below about @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 if they are in our galaxy .",
    "they could be cvs , vfxts with a bh or ns as the accretor , or stars with extremely strong flares .    although most of our sources still require future optical spectroscopic observations and/or long - term x - ray monitoring to finally pin down their nature , it is clear that our sample contains a variety of objects with all kinds of spectral behavior .",
    "some of them belong to rare classes that still have relatively small numbers of sources known , such as very soft x - ray sources , very faint transient and new - born persistent sources , and our discovery of new objects for these classes is thus important for our understanding of them .",
    "we found their properties mostly consistent with previous studies , but some new results were also obtained .",
    "focusing on the seven very soft x - ray sources , we found the existence of both supersoft and quasisoft x - ray sources and the possibility that some of them are the same class of objects because supersoft and quasisoft spectra can be observed in a single source ( see source # 8085 ) , consistent with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , we also observed some evidence that they displayed various kinds of spectral evolution behavior ( being transient or persistent with either small or large long - term variability and displaying state transition ) often seen in x - ray binaries .",
    "it is not clear whether this is completely because our sample might include several classes of objects .",
    "our discovery of some unique objects is also significant , especially source # 107102 , as an agn candidate with very soft spectra and a strong qpo in x - rays @xcite .",
    "there is only one other agn known to show similarly weak hard x - ray emission ( , @xcite ) and only two other galactic nuclei with qpos significantly detected ( , @xcite ; , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> three highly variable hard sources appear at low galactic latitudes and have maximum luminosities below @xmath0@xmath7 erg s@xmath5 if they are in our galaxy , thus great candidates for cataclysmic variables or very faint x - ray transients harboring a black hole or neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> our interpretations of these sources can be tested with future long - term x - ray monitoring and multi - wavelength observations . </S>"
