    "it follows that the non - invertibility of a chord diagram can be checked on the level of the universal enveloping algebra : if the @xmath49-image of a diagram is not @xmath61-invariant , then the diagram itself is not invariant under @xmath36 .",

    "another , yet simpler , reformulation of the invertibility problem , can be given in terms of colored _ jacobi _ diagrams .",
