    "currently there are two hipparcos++ missions in preparation : usno leads a collaboration to build fame , a midex type mission to be launched in 2004 , and germany is planning the diva mission .",
    "these spacecraft will extend the reach of astrometry to about two kpc from 100 parsec .",
    "space interferometry is the next step , with the ultimate goal to detect and characterize earth - like planets around nearby stars ( nasa s tpf and esa s darwin missions ) . before that , nasa s space interferometry mission ( sim ) can determine the distances to virtually any star in the milky  way with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "many important problems in milky way research can be solved with micro - arcsecond astrometric data .",
    "sim will also contribute significantly to the field of cosmology .",
    "globular clusters play an important role in cosmology in that they contain the oldest stars known to mankind .",
    "however , precise age determinations are currently hampered by the lack of accurate distances .",
    "sim will provide such distances , and will hence establish a firm lower limit to the age of the universe .",
    "sim would contribute more directly to cosmology if its data could be used to establish the parallax of nearby spirals and hence provide a calibration of the zero - point of the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is one of the tools to measure the expansion rate ( h@xmath2 ) of the universe .",
    "a sim - based determination of the zero - point of the tf relation would thus directly yield a determination of h@xmath2 with an accuracy of several percent , an order of magnitude improvement over the current state of affairs .",
    "unfortunately , sim s phenomenal precision is still not quite good enough to achieve this .",
    "however , other , only slightly less direct methods can be applied . in this paper",
    "we describe one of those techniques : the rotational parallax method .",
    "imagine a nearby spiral galaxy at distance , @xmath3 ( in mpc ) , inclined with respect to the line of sight ( by @xmath4 degrees ) that has a rotational speed of @xmath5 @xmath6 . the andromeda galaxy ( m  31 , ngc  204 ) is such a galaxy ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "its rotational speed ( @xmath8 ) induces a proper motion of @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is a constant that arises from the choice of units , and @xmath11 if @xmath3 is measured in mpc and  in micro - arcsec per year .",
    "such proper motion is easily resolvable with an instrument such as sim .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fo_geometry ] we present a sketch of how a typical nearby spiral might appear on the sky ( bottom panel ) . in the plane of the galaxy ( top panel ) we use two",
    "coordinate systems : rectangular ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and polar ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "projected on the plane of the sky , the @xmath12 and @xmath16 coordinates axes coincide with the major and minor axes , respectively .",
    "the @xmath16 coordinate is the foreshortened @xmath13 coordinate .    in this section",
    "we will discuss the simplified case that all stellar orbits are circular , more realistic situations are discussed in ",

    "the following elementary relations between the coordinates and the various projections of the orbital speed @xmath17 are derived with the aid of fig .",
    "[ fig : fo_geometry ] : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the projections of @xmath17 on the @xmath12 and @xmath13 axes .",
    "the angle @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath20 equals @xmath23 for circular orbits .",
    "@xmath24 is the radial velocity along the line of sight and @xmath25  and @xmath26  are the components of @xmath17 along the apparent major and minor axes .",
    "the requirement that velocities are positive in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions leads to @xmath29 for counter - clockwise rotation , and @xmath30 for clockwise motions .",
    "the observable proper motions along @xmath12 and @xmath16 are symbolized by @xmath31  and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the derivation of distances from observed proper motions and radial velocities is a well established practice in astronomy ( e.g. orbital parallax ) , and are among the most reliable distance measures available .",
    "since the proper motion is the ratio of a velocity ( in @xmath6 ) and the distance , the latter can be determined from observations .",
    "a common problem is that the angle between the space velocity and the line - of - sight is typically not known , so that the distance is determined modulo @xmath33 . for external galaxies ,",
    "the inclination is well established from the axis ratio of the image and/or from the analysis of  or h  @xmath34 radial velocity fields .",
    "the principal axis method is particularly appealing for the case of circular orbits .",
    "for elliptical orbits we have to introduce two additional a priori unknown angles : the angle @xmath35 between the orbital velocity ( @xmath36 ) and the tangent to a circular orbit at the major axis , and the angle between a circular and an elliptical orbit at the minor axis , @xmath37 .",
    "these two angular differences are related to the eccentricity ( @xmath38 ) and position angle ( @xmath39 ) of the elliptical orbit . before proceeding in the derivation of the distance , it is profitable to re - write equations  ( [ eqn : v_r])-([eqn : vpar ] ) for stars located on the principal axes : @xmath40 \\mu_{m } & = & { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}(\\cos\\theta=\\pm1 ) & = &              \\frac{{\\ensuremath{v_{y'}}}}{\\kappa d } \\phantom{\\sin } & = &               s_\\omega \\frac{v_o \\cos\\delta\\theta_m \\cos{i}}{\\kappa d }     \\\\*[3 mm ] \\tan\\delta_{\\theta_m } & = & \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}(\\cos\\theta=\\pm1)}{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}(\\cos\\theta=\\pm1 ) }     & & & &     \\\\*[3 mm ] \\mu_m & = & { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}(\\sin(\\theta)=\\pm1 ) & = & \\frac{v_x}{\\kappa d } & = - &            s_\\omega \\frac{v_o \\cos\\delta\\theta_m}{\\kappa d } \\ , \\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the radial and proper motion on the major axis and @xmath43 equals the proper motion on the minor axis . with an assumed inclination the first two equations of ( [ eqn : eqns_mm ] ) can be solved for the `` major - axis '' distance @xmath44 [ eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : d_m ] ) below ] .",
    "further simplifications can be made in case the orbits are circular , so that the @xmath45 and @xmath46 terms in ( [ eqn : eqns_mm ] ) equal unity .",
    "@xmath44 and the `` minor - major axes '' inclination and distance are given by : @xmath47 d_{mm } & = & \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mid v_{r , m } \\mid}}}{\\kappa \\sqrt{\\mu^2_m - \\mu^2_m } }     \\ , \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : d_mm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a clear advantage of the  method is that the systemic motion of the galaxy as a whole can be taken out easily by considering points symmetric with respect to the center of the galaxy .",
    "rotation - induced proper motions at symmetric points have opposite sign , while the radial and planar components of the systemic velocity ( @xmath48 ) have the same orientation and magnitude .",
    "the rotation - induced proper motion component can thus be easily computed .",
    "for example , when taking out the systemic motion , @xmath49 and @xmath41 in equations ( [ eqn : d_m])-([eqn : d_mm ] ) should be replaced by @xmath50 $ ] and similar relations for @xmath24 and @xmath42 .",
    "the primed relations indicate the observed motions that include the projection of the systemic motion .    one potential disadvantage of this principal axes or @xmath51 method [ cf .",
    "( [ eqn : d_mm ] ) ] is that the measurements of @xmath43 and @xmath42 are to be taken at the same galactocentric radius , or from radii with the same circular velocity and inclination . in the discussion above we",
    "did not consider the possibility that the actual distances to the target stars may differ significantly , which may be the case for the nearest galaxies ( up to 5% for m  31 & m  33 ) .",
    "however , application of the major - axis method ( [ eqn : d_m ] ) is unaffected by this problem .",
    "we present a more general distance solution in later sections .",
    "another potential disadvantage of the  method is that the available surface area in the galaxy for suitable stars is relatively small , since the target stars are limited to regions close to the principal axes and because suitably bright targets are quite rare .",
    "fortunately , other rotational parallax varieties exist , and we discuss their merits below .    in fact , we can determine the distance of a single stars if we neglect , for now , the systemic motion of the galaxy and the random motions of the stars . using some of the relations ( [ eqn : for_x])-([eqn : vpar ] ) , we solve for the inclination of the stellar orbit : @xmath52     \\cos^2{i } & = & \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}}{-{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{x } } } } \\frac{y'}{x } \\ , \\ , ,        \\label{eqn : cos2i_circ}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eqn : cosi_ellipt ] ) holds for any type of orbit , circular or elliptical .",
    "further , if the orbit is circular we can equate @xmath15 and @xmath21 and arrive at equation  ( [ eqn : cos2i_circ ] ) . the orbital speed can be computed from the radial velocity [ eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : v_r ] ) ] : @xmath53 . this equation can be re - written for the elliptical and circular orbit cases with the aid of eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : cos_theta_ell ] ) and ( [ eqn : cos2i_circ ] ) , respectively : @xmath54 in the last equation we expressed the trigonometric terms in the primary observables",
    ".    a rotational parallax distance can now be obtained by combining the radial velocity and either the proper motion perpendicular or parallel to the major axis . as was the case for the principal axis method",
    ", we need to make a distinction between the case of elliptical and circular orbits .",
    "if the orbit is elliptical , the distance must be calculated from @xmath24 and @xmath32 , and depends _ only _ on the assumed inclination . in the circular orbit case",
    "the expressions obtained from the @xmath31  and @xmath32  are identical and can be re - written in terms of observable quantities only .",
    "for the two single - star distances we find : @xmath55     d_{pp } & = & \\frac{v_r}{\\kappa }       \\sqrt{- \\frac{y'/{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}}{x{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}+ y'{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y ' } } } } }        \\label{eqn : d_pp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will refer to distances calculated from the perpendicular and parallel proper motions of individual stars [ eqn.([eqn : d_pp ] ) ] as ``  distances . ''",
    "it is instructive to estimate the attainable errors using sim astrometry .",
    "this is most easily done for the case of circular orbits .",
    "below we present the expressions for the errors in the inferred distance , inclination and circular velocity , where we express all trigonometric terms in the primary observables :    @xmath56 \\frac { \\delta d_{mm } } { d_{mm } } & = &     \\sqrt { \\left(\\frac{\\delta   v_r } { v_r}\\right)^2 +             \\left(\\frac{\\mu_m \\delta \\mu_m}{\\mu^2_m -\\mu^2_m}\\right)^2 +             \\left(\\frac{\\mu_m \\delta \\mu_m}{\\mu^2_m -\\mu^2_m}\\right)^2    }     \\label{eqn : delta_mm } \\\\*[3 mm ] \\frac { \\delta \\cos{^2i } } { \\cos{^2i } } & = &     \\sqrt { \\left(\\frac{\\delta { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}}\\right)^2 +             \\left(\\frac{\\delta { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}}\\right)^2 }     \\label{eqn : delta_cos2i } \\\\*[3 mm ] \\left ( \\frac { \\delta v_c } { v_c } \\right)^2 & = &     \\left ( \\frac{\\delta   v_r } { v_r } \\right)^2 +         \\left (   \\frac{y'}{2 } \\ ,                \\frac{x ( { \\ensuremath{\\mu^2_{x}}}-{\\ensuremath{\\mu^2_{y ' } } } ) + 2 y ' { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y ' } } } }                    { ( x { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}+ y ' { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y ' } } } ) ( x { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}- y ' { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x } } } ) }        \\right)^2 \\times \\nonumber \\\\*[1.5 mm ] & & \\phantom {   \\left ( \\frac{\\delta   v_r } { v_r } \\right)^2 + }      \\left ( \\left ( \\frac{\\delta { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{x } } } } \\right)^2 +              \\left ( \\frac{\\delta { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y ' } } } } \\right)^2      \\right )     \\label{eqn : delta_mper } \\\\*[3 mm ] \\left ( \\frac { \\delta d_{pp } } { d_{pp } } \\right)^2   & = &     \\left(\\frac{\\delta v_r } { v_r}\\right)^2 +      \\frac{1}{4 ( x { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}+ y ' { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}})^2 } \\times \\nonumber \\\\*[1.5 mm ] & & \\phantom { \\left(\\frac{\\delta   v_r } { v_r}\\right)^2 + }      \\left ( ( x { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}})^2 \\left ( \\frac{\\delta { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{x } } } } \\right)^2 +             ( x { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{x}}}+ 2 y ' { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}})^2   \\left ( \\frac{\\delta { \\ensuremath{\\mu_{y'}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mu_{y ' } } } } \\right)^2     \\right )     \\label{eqn : delta_pp } \\ ] ]    at large inclination , where @xmath57 , the errors on @xmath5 and  simplify to + @xmath58 .",
    "typical values for proper motions may be @xmath59 @xmath60(40 for m31 ) , @xmath61 @xmath60 , while the radial velocity uncertainty would be less than 10 @xmath6 .",
    "for m31 , the fractional errors in the radial velocity and the proper motions equal about , 4% , @xmath62% and @xmath63% , for @xmath24 , @xmath32 , and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the total fractional errors on @xmath5 and @xmath64 are of order 15 , 15 , and 25% , respectively .",
    "these values compare well with the exact values presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : m31_4mmas ] .",
    "these considerations indicate that proper motion errors dominate the final uncertainty in the derived distances .",
    "the  distance can have substantially smaller errors .",
    "also note that , in the pure circular motion case , the  distance estimate requires astrometry for two stars , while the  distances can be obtained for one star only so as to compare the distance errors per target ( i.e. per unit integration time ) . ] .",
    "we compare the distance error budgets in figures  ( [ fig : m31_4mmas])-([fig : m81_ast_acc ] ) , for m  31 , m  33 and m  81 for a range of plausible astrometric errors .",
    "these figures illustrate an important aspect of the single - star method : the attainable distance and inclination errors are not very sensitive to the galactic azimuth @xmath15 . as a result",
    ", targets from all over the galaxy can be incorporated in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , because of its proximity and large rotation speed , m  31 clearly offers the best opportunity for reliable rotational parallax measurements , followed by m  33 and m  81 .",
    "the same figures indicate that the  method works best at low inclinations and that the  method is superior at large inclinations .",
    "the latter fact can be understood as follows : for a strongly inclined galaxy , the proper motion perpendicular to the major axis is small ( @xmath65 ) , so that the @xmath42 term in equation  ( [ eqn : d_mm ] ) for @xmath66 goes to zero . in that case @xmath67 ) . as a result ,",
    "the third error - term in equation ( [ eqn : delta_mm ] ) becomes negligible .",
    "for the  method however , both proper motions are required to derive the distance , so that the proper motion error comes in twice .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m31_errcnt ] we present the dependence of the distance errors on both radial velocity and proper motion errors for m  31 . in that figure we contour , from top to bottom , the fractional errors on @xmath64 , @xmath68 and @xmath66 . for the local group galaxies it will pay off to decrease the radial velocity errors to as low values as possible .",
    "as expected , proper motion errors dominate the error budget for distant galaxies such as m  81 ( @xmath69 mpc , not shown ) .",
    "naively , one might expect that of our three distance estimators , @xmath64 would be determined most accurately .",
    "after all , for this calculation we _ assume _ an inclination and we use only _ one _ proper potion , while @xmath66 and @xmath68 require an additional proper motion measurement .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : m31_errcnt ] ) shows that ( for @xmath70 ) this is not always the case .",
    "in fact , the actual expected errors are complex functions of location in the galaxy , inclination , rotation speed and distance . for distant galaxies ,",
    "the errors are dominated by proper motion errors , so that all three methods are equivalent ( not shown ) . for m  33 all methods yield approximately equally well determined distances , while distance errors for m  31 are minimized if we can use the principal axes method .    for @xmath71 @xmath60  and @xmath72 @xmath6 , the errors on the inferred distance equal about 6 , 15 , and 10% for m  31 , m  33 and",
    "m  81 , respectively . for the local groups galaxies the random motions of stars introduce additional uncertainties . assuming a dispersion of 10 @xmath6 , the effective proper motion accuracies are about 2.5 @xmath60  at 0.8 mpc .",
    "the internal dispersion at the distance of m  81 is about five times smaller and insignificant with respect to the likely measurement errors that sim can attain in `` reasonable '' integration times .",
    "in section  [ sec : the_principal_axes_method ] we have seen that systematic motions induced by the space motion of the galaxy ( @xmath73 ) can be corrected for rather easily in the principal axes method .",
    "likewise , a global fit to the observed proper motions and radial velocities would allow for the determination of @xmath73  in the  method .",
    "for example , the radial velocities of m  31 , m  33 and m  81 equal -300 @xmath744 , -200 @xmath746 and -34 @xmath744 @xmath6 .",
    "these velocities are comparable to their internal velocities of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath6",
    ". we will discuss this issue in later subsections .",
    "it is known from radial velocity observations that , for most galaxies , the inclination gradually changes as a function of radius .",
    "this so - called `` warping '' is most pronounced beyond the optical disk @xcite .",
    "although such inclination changes are hard to detect inside the optical disk , some galaxies are known to warp in the the outskirts of the optical disk , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "these authors measured the warps at a distance ( @xmath78 ) where the b - band surface brightness is roughly 25 magnitudes per square arcseconds .",
    "this surface brightness is reached at radii of approximately 90 and 31 arc - minutes in m  31 and m  33 , respectively @xcite .",
    "cursory inspection of large - scale optical pictures of the andromeda galaxy suggests that the plane of the galaxy is warped in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the orientation of the outer isophotes starts changing an indication of a warp beyond about 90 arc - minutes from the center @xcite .",
    "also , an analysis of the spiral structure and  radial velocity field of m  31 suggests that the inclination is about 60  at 10  from the center . due to the almost linear warping of @xmath79 per kpc ,",
    "an inclination of 80  is reached at a radius of 100  @xcite .",
    "braun s determination of the radial inclination gradient is based on the association of  with spiral arms , but does not self - consistently include the non - axisymmetric velocity component that is likely to be induced by the spiral density wave .",
    "it thus may be that the actual warp is less severe than claimed by braun .",
    "similarly , an analysis of the optical spiral arms in m  33 suggests that the inclination of m  33 changes from forty to sixty - three degrees across the disk @xcite , although this result is disputed @xcite . on the other hand , the  warping of m  33 @xcite sets in around @xmath78 ( i.e. , 30 arcmin , or 8.2 kpc at 0.84 mpc ) .",
    "non - circular orbits , or more generally , streaming motions with respect to the simplified picture of the circular orbit might significantly complicate the determination of rotational parallaxes . streaming motions induced by spiral density waves can reach tens of kilometers per second , depending on the galaxy , and the locations of the target with respect to the spiral arms .",
    "to first order , such deviations would induce systematic errors in the inferred distances that equal the systematic velocities induced by spiral density waves , or about @xmath80% .",
    "the theory of spiral arm density waves has been developed extensively [ e.g. @xcite ] . applications of this theory to radial velocity fields of external galaxies show that streaming motions of the order of 20 - 50 @xmath6  [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "the analysis of the spiral structure of m  31 by @xcite indicates streaming motions of 40 @xmath6  for radii smaller than 40@xmath81 , of 20 @xmath6  between 30@xmath81 and 75@xmath81 and of order 10 @xmath6  in the outermost parts .",
    "m  31 exhibits a well developed two - armed spiral pattern with a small , but radially varying pitch angle @xcite . in the inner region , @xmath82",
    ", the spiral has a larger pitch angle ( @xmath83 ) than in the outer region ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "stars will respond to the potential induced by the spiral density wave .",
    "if the pattern is logarithmic , the radial and tangential velocities [ @xmath85 and @xmath86 induced by the perturbation can be found analytically .",
    "these perturbation velocities vary with ( extra )  galactocentric radius @xmath14 .",
    "so do the pitch angle and the spiral phase ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "@xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath39 and @xmath87 can be calculated from the rotation curve , the stellar velocity dispersion , and the pattern - speed and amplitude of the perturbation , where the last three properties are not well established observationally for our target galaxies .",
    "this procedure has been followed for the milky way @xcite , and can be readily generalized to external galaxies .",
    "it is also possible that the spiral structure is generated in response to a bar or nearby companions .",
    "for the andromeda galaxy , the companions , m  32 and ngc  205 , have estimated peri - centers between 13 and 35 kpc [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "in fact , radial velocities and sim - based proper motions can conceivably be used to _ determine _ the parameters of the spiral pattern , and allow for detailed tests of various theories of spiral structure .    however , these spiral - structure theories have a large number of parameters . in the density - wave theory ,",
    "almost all factors that determine the spiral pattern depend on galactocentric radius , so that these `` factors '' are really _ functions _ with many more unknowns .",
    "further , on small scales , the details of spiral structure may deviate from the large - scale @xmath90-armed spiral .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that the large star - formation complex ngc  206 in andromeda resulted from the recent interaction between two spiral - arm segments , moving with relative velocity of about 30 @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the often seen bifurcations in the spiral patterns of spiral galaxies may arise from the superposition of spiral modes with different multiplicity .",
    "the milky way may be an example of two - plus - four armed spiral galaxy @xcite .",
    "clearly , we would like to avoid the complications that arise due to streaming motions on small and large scales .",
    "we will discuss the effects of non - axisymmetric streaming motions in more detail in section  [ sec : practical_implementation ] .",
    "in the previous sections we discussed the case of circular orbits and alluded occasionally to the case of elliptical orbits .",
    "a complication of elliptical orbits is that the angle between the orbital velocity and the line - of - sight ( @xmath21 ) can not be deduced from the position of the target and the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "that is to say , @xmath91 [ c.f . eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : tan_theta ] ) and ( [ eqn : cos_theta_ell ] ) ] .",
    "this means that predicting the orbital motion ( velocity and direction ) at point ( @xmath92 ) given measurements at ( @xmath93 ) becomes significantly more complicated , even if these points lie at the same galactocentric radius .",
    "knowledge of the ellipticity and position angle of the orbit are required to solve this problem .",
    "furthermore , due to the intrinsic dispersions of the target population , additional velocity vectors are added to the motions of the targets .",
    "all these parameters are likely to depend on galactocentric distance .",
    "and finally , the systemic motion of the galaxy needs to be determined and its effects subtracted from on the individual radial velocities and proper motions .",
    "here we extend on the procedure to determine the @xmath64 distance [    [ sec : the_single_star_method ] , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : d_yp ] ) ] and make use of the fact that the radial velocity and the @xmath26 velocity are two orthogonal components of the _ total _ space velocity in the @xmath95 plane ( @xmath96 , see figure  [ fig : so_vels ] ) . like in equation  ( [ eqn : d_yp ] )",
    ", the distance then follows from the observed radial velocity and @xmath16 proper motion : @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the angle between @xmath96 and the plane of the sky . generally speaking",
    ", @xmath98 differs from the geometric inclination of the galaxy .",
    "for example , @xmath98 will lie between @xmath4 and 90  if random motions are unimportant and the systemic motion is due to hubble flow only .",
    "we illustrate the various contributions to @xmath96 in figure  [ fig : so_vels ] . from this figure",
    "we deduce the following relations for the observed @xmath16 proper motion and the radial velocity : @xmath99 v_{obs , r } & = &     \\left ( v_{c , y } + v_{e , y } + v_{\\sigma , y } \\right ) \\sin i      + v_{sys , ry ' } \\sin i_s - v_{\\sigma , z } \\cos i      \\label{eqn : vobs_r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 represents the angle between the systemic motion and the plane of the sky .",
    "the orbital velocity in the @xmath13-direction ( @xmath101 ) comprises both a circular orbit term ( @xmath102 ) and a contribution for the ellipticity of the orbit ( @xmath103 ) .",

    "in general , neither the true inclination and distance , nor the correct elliptical streaming field will be used in the empirical determination of the rhss of the @xmath158 equations .",
    "thus , higher order @xmath15 modulations will be observable in the rhss of the @xmath158 equations .",

    "with @xmath163 we find : @xmath164 at the inclination of the andromeda galaxy , the @xmath165 modulations have an amplitude of about @xmath166 percent of the @xmath160 amplitudes , or several @xmath6 .",
    "we find that , with a sufficient number targets , such effects are easily detectable .",
    "in fact , if we expand the rhss of the @xmath158 equations in fourier series , their @xmath165 coefficients can be used to calculate new estimates for the inclination : @xmath167 and @xmath168 with @xmath169 and @xmath170 the measured fourier coefficients of the @xmath171 , and @xmath172 modulations .",
    "significant @xmath165 coefficients can occur in two cases : 1 ) the correct elliptical streaming was determined but the estimated inclination is wrong , and 2 ) the right inclination was determined , but the wrong @xmath165 components was fitted for the elliptical streaming field .",
    "the observed @xmath165 terms can only be used to arrive at a better inclination estimate in case the correct @xmath151  has been subtracted . generally speaking ,",
    "that can not known to be the case . however , in both cases , the presence of significant @xmath165 terms indicate that the model used is inadequate and that a better solution is possible .",
    "further , the ambiguity of the meaning of any detected @xmath165 modulation also illustrates the necessity of a multiple non - linear regression technique .",
    "so far , the invisible component remains undetectable , even when the @xmath165 constraints are included , and even if a multiple non - linear regression technique has been used . as it turns out ,",
    "the lowest order ( @xmath160 ) fourier coefficients of the expansion of the @xmath158 equations provide powerful additional constraints on the invisible elliptical streaming components .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath143  is non - existent , in that case , the @xmath173 and @xmath174 coefficients of the cosine and sine modulations should be identical and equal to the rotation speed of the galaxy . if @xmath143  is non - zero , @xmath173 will not be equal to @xmath174 .",
    "unfortunately , equations  ( [ eqn : vc_inf_x ] ) and ( [ eqn : vc_inf_r ] ) are not sufficient to determine the three unknowns contained in the two equations .",
    "however , it is not necessary to know the values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 separately .",
    "only the algebraic sum of the two invisible components , @xmath175 , occur in equations  ( [ eqn : mu_tot_xr ] ) and ( [ eqn : mu_tot_xyp ] ) .",
    "thus , in these two equations , @xmath176 can be replaced by @xmath177 . in a multiple regression technique ,",
    "the circular velocity thus becomes a to - be - fitted parameter . as a result",
    ", the @xmath158 equations will also allow for the determination of both invisible components of the elliptical streaming field .",
    "the arguments presented above show that , with the additional constraint that the @xmath158 equations only show a @xmath15 modulations , all parameters of the model can be determined .",
    "because even the `` invisible '' components of the elliptical streaming field can be determined experimentally , the inferred distance , inclination rotation speed and galaxian space motion can be measured without significant systematic errors .      in the sim book",
    "it is suggested one - hundred targets are observed in both m  31 and m  33 and twenty - five in m  81 .",
    "our discussion above indicate that systematic errors will be unimportant so that the final attainable distance error is inversely proportional to the square - root of the number of target stars . with such a moderate number of targets and a proper motion uncertainty of 4@xmath60 ,",

    "it should be kept in mind that these considerations neglect several important aspects that will be subject of future study .",
    "first , systematic effects _ internal _ to the galaxies such as spiral arm streaming motions or runaway stars will reduce the final achievable results . on the positive side",
    ", it will be possible to identify `` deviant '' objects using the single star method so that they can be eliminated from the target list .",
    "further , it may very well be possible that a global fit to the proper motions and radial velocities of the targets will produce significantly tighter results if we impose smoothness criteria for the radial variation of rotation speed and inclination .",
    "it might also be possible to use external information on the radial gradients of the inclination and rotation curve from the  velocity field to further decrease the errors .",
    "this too will be investigated in the near future .",
    "we have generated numerical models that describe the stellar motions in three potential sim targets : m  31 , m  81 and m  3 .",
    "the stellar disks of these model galaxies are inclined by 77 , 56 , and 57  with respect to the line - of - sight , respectively .",
    "the motions of the stars have circular velocity components of 270 , 213 and 97.3 @xmath6 , while we add a random component to the targets of 10 @xmath6 in all three directions .",
    "we computed several models with either fixed inclinations or a small inclination gradient .",
    "we also varied the elliptical streaming component , from non - existent to strong ( approximately 20% of the circular velocity ) , where we tried several angular dependencies consistent with the toy model described in section  [ sec : non_circular_motions ] ( i.e. , @xmath15 components only ) .",
    "our method of analysis of this model data is described by the poor - man s approach of section  [ sec : the_works ] .",
    "we ran six different models with 100 - 600 targets .",
    "each of these models were `` observed '' @xmath180 times where for each try we added random terms to the stellar space motions to simulate observational errors . to the radial velocity we added random errors from 2.5 to 10 @xmath6 , in steps of 2.5 @xmath6 , while we used a large range of proper motion errors ( between 1 and 50 @xmath60 ) .",
    "the results for the three galaxies are summarized in figures  [ fig : m31_mod_res]-[fig : m81_mod_res ] .",
    "each of these three figures contain three rows and four columns .",
    "the results for the smallest number of targets are displayed in the top row , those for the largest number of stars in the bottom panels . in the left two columns we plot",
    "the inferred rms and systematic distance errors , respectively .",
    "the two systemic error flags ( sefs ) are plotted in the two right columns . for m  31 , for which the observed proper motions are largest , the rms errors are encouragingly small , even for a small number of targets .",
    "the inferred systematic errors are also small , which is confirmed by the small sef values . for the other two galaxies , significant systematic errors result from the poor - man s approach .",
    "this is probably a result of the fact that these galaxies have smaller rotational proper motions . on the positive side ,",
    "the sefs are also clearly raised , indicating that the poor - man s solutions are erroneous .",
    "if the systemic velocity is zero , the systematic variation of of the distancew @xmath3 ^ 2 + [ r\\cos\\theta]^2}$ ] ] along an annulus will introduce a deviation from the linear behavior of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mu_yp_ab ] ) . however , the deviation due to the `` proximity effect '' , @xmath181 , is rather small : @xmath182 and @xmath183 @xmath184  for the lmc , m  31 , m  33 and m  81 , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath185 in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : mu_yp_ab ] ) has a distance dependence as well so that the systemic velocity terms will also contribute to @xmath181 .",

    "however , for `` reasonable '' values of the systemic velocity , @xmath181 will be still be rather small .    with the possible exception of the magellanic clouds",
    ", we do not expect that it will be possible to determine the proximity effect with sim data , in part due to the small number of stars that sim can measure . recall that a velocity dispersion of 10 @xmath6  corresponds to about 3 @xmath184 , or about twenty times the proximity effect , at the distance of m  31 . assuming",
    "that measuring @xmath181 at ten @xmath94  positions would suffice to determine the proximity effect , we estimate that at least @xmath187 targets are required .",

    "<S> , it becomes possible to determine an accurate zero - point for the tully - fisher relation , one of the tools to measure distances throughout the universe . </S>",
    "<S> precision cosmology will become possible once the hubble constant has been accurately determined from a sim - based calibration of the tully - fisher relation . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational parallax method employs the common motions of a number of stars to determine the distance to the group as a whole . if we assume that a given target star in an external galaxy is on a circular orbit around the center of that galaxy , three observables the two proper motions and the radial velocity suffice to determine the three unknowns : the inclination of the orbit , the rotational velocity and the distance . </S>",
    "<S> several factors complicate the application of this simple technique to real galaxies : 1 ) the target galaxy may have substantial space - motion , 2 ) stars in real galaxies are not on circular orbits ( e.g. due to spiral - arm streaming motions or induced by random motions ) , 3 ) stars in the galaxy are at significantly different distances from the sun ( the near side of m  31 is @xmath15% closer than the far side ) , 4 ) target stars might have large z - heights or velocities ( `` run - away '' stars ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show how one - percent distances can be obtaind for the nearest spirals , even in the presence of the complications mentioned above . </S>"
