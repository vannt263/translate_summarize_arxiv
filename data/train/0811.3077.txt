    "the hubbard model is a simplified lattice model used to describe electrons with short - range interactions @xcite .",

    "a lot of work has been done on finding exact eigenvalues for the hubbard model and for similar models . in most cases",
    "only the one dimensional models can be solved analytically .",
    "we refer to the one dimensional hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions as the hubbard ring .",
    "most analytic results for the hubbard ring are found using the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "however , also other methods have been used to analyse these models @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of the hubbard ring is that one observes crossings between the energy levels which seemingly violate the wigner - von neumann noncrossing rule @xcite .",
    "one can use the symmetries of the hamiltonian to explain such violations @xcite .",
    "here , we give an explanation which does not rely on the integrability of @xmath0 but rather on that of some reference hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the latter was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this approach is more general in the sense that @xmath0 does not need to be integrable and @xmath1 can have a much simpler spectrum than @xmath0 .",
    "we elaborate the method of @xcite by introducing a hierarchy of equations .",
    "although we will only use this hierarchy to find solutions for the @xmath2 hubbard ring it should be noted that such a hierarchy always exists .",
    "overview of the paper . in section 2",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is defined and some notations are introduced . in section 3",
    "the hierarchy is introduced and the general theorems are proven .",
    "section 4 contains the analytical eigenvalues for the @xmath2 hubbard ring .",
    "we use our theorems to classify these eigenvalues .",
    "section 5 gives an overview of the results and conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard ring is @xcite @xmath3 we consider this model on a lattice with four positions and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore we assume that only nearest neighbour hopping is possible and that the band is half filled .",
    "this means there are two electrons with spin up and two with spin down and the coefficients @xmath4 satisfy @xmath5 .",
    "thus the only parameter on which the eigenvalues of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) depend is @xmath6 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the counting operator , here denoted @xmath7 , is defined as @xmath8 it counts the number of sites with double occupation . however , the choice of counting operator is never unique .",
    "it turns out to be advantageous also to consider additional counting operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which differ from @xmath7 by adding , respectively , subtracting 1 , whenever a doubly occupied site is flanked by to singly occupied sites . in formulas , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the orthogonal projection onto the space @xmath13 spanned by the configurations where two spins on the same site are surrounded by sites with a single occupancy .",
    "it can easily be verified that @xmath14,m_i],m_i]=[h , m_i]$ ] for @xmath15 .",
    "then @xcite there exist operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath18 with @xmath17 and @xmath16 satisfying @xmath19&=&0\\nonumber\\\\ \\left[r_i , m_i\\right]&= & r_i\\label{commutation}\\\\ h_{\\rm ref , i}^\\dagger&=&h_{\\rm ref , i}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the choices ( [ m1operator ] ) and ( [ m2operator ] ) , the corresponding reference hamiltonians @xmath16 coincide .",
    "the extra index @xmath20 will be omitted in the following , this is , @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath22 does not equal @xmath23 .",
    "the method to construct explicit expressions for @xmath1 en @xmath17 can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , in general , the eigenvalues of @xmath24 are of the form @xmath25 for some constants @xmath26 . in the @xmath2 hubbard ring with two spin up and two spin down electrons",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath24 are @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "to simplify the notation we will in this section omit the index @xmath20 .",
    "all results hold for any of the @xmath24 . in this section",
    "we derive a hierarchy of equations which is equivalent with the eigenvalue equation .",
    "this hierarchy will later be used to analyse the spectrum of the @xmath2 hubbard ring .",
    "however , the theorems in this section are much more general .",
    "the only condition for these theorems to hold is that the hamiltonian can be written as ( [ decomposition ] ) , satisfying ( [ commutation ] ) . to simplify the calculations",
    "we will also assume that the spectrum of @xmath30 is of the form @xmath31 for some @xmath32 , as is the case for the hubbard ring .",
    "however , the theorems can be generalized for models where this is not the case .",
    "an eigenvector @xmath33 of @xmath0 can be decomposed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 . here ,",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are both non zero , @xmath38 can be finite or infinite and @xmath39 can be both zero or non zero . without loss of generality",
    "we will prove our theorems for @xmath40 . using this decomposition of the eigenvector the eigenvalue equation @xmath41",
    "can also be decomposed into the following hierarchy of equations @xmath42 if @xmath43 , then ( [ eigenvalue ] ) simplifies to @xmath44 now assume that @xmath45 .",
    "the first equation of the hierarchy then becomes @xmath46 if @xmath38 is finite there is also a last equation in the hierarchy which reads @xmath47 from ( [ commutation ] ) it is clear that @xmath30 and @xmath48 commute .",
    "thus it is possible to find simultaneous eigenstates for @xmath30 and @xmath48 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath30 and @xmath1 .",
    "however @xmath1 does not commute with @xmath48 . while this means",
    "there is no basis in which both operators are diagonal it is still possible that there are some simultaneous eigenstates . if such states exist they can be used to construct special eigenstates of @xmath0 according to the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath49 be an eigenstate of @xmath30 , @xmath48 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 with eigenvalues @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath27 and @xmath27 .",
    "assume the states @xmath49 and @xmath54 are both eigenstates of @xmath1 with eigenvalues @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath57 with @xmath58 are eigenstates of @xmath0 which have @xmath59 and eigenvalue @xmath60 .    calculating @xmath61 gives @xmath62 from this it follows that @xmath33 is an eigenstate of @xmath0 if @xmath63 this condition is satisfied if @xmath58 . from ( [ heq ] )",
    "follows that @xmath60 . because @xmath64 it is straightforward to prove that @xmath59 . in the case of the @xmath2 hubbard ring with two spin up electrons and two spin down electrons both @xmath65 and @xmath66 equal zero",
    "however , if an electron is added to ( or removed from ) the model there are states of this form for which @xmath66 does not vanish .",
    "a similar construction can be done for @xmath67 states .",
    "however , the constant @xmath68 then becomes a solution of higher order equations which means there are not always analytical expressions for the eigenvalues . for the @xmath2 hubbard ring",
    "the highest order equation that occurs in these constructions is a cubic equation",
    ".    the following theorem about the @xmath59 case can now be proven ( a more general form of this theorem , not using the hierarchy , can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath33 is an eigenstate of @xmath0 for which @xmath59 , then @xmath69 is also an eigenstate of @xmath0 for some @xmath70 , with a different eigenvalue .",
    "because @xmath33 has @xmath59 it can be written as @xmath71 .",
    "clearly @xmath49 can then be decomposed as @xmath72 with @xmath73 . from theorem 1",
    "then follows that also @xmath74 .",
    "therefore @xmath75 hence , @xmath49 is an eigenstate of @xmath0 iff @xmath76 thus @xmath77 from which @xmath78 can be calculated .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath79 and @xmath80 of two states which are connected in the sense of theorem 2 satisfy @xmath81 with @xmath53 defined as in theorem 1 .    in the formulation of the third theorem we use the following notion . the hierarchical decomposition ( [ eigenvector ] ) of the eigenvector @xmath33",
    "is said to be _ minimal _ if none of the sums @xmath82 with @xmath83 is an eigenvector of @xmath0 .    if @xmath49 and @xmath33 are eigenstates of @xmath0 with the same eigenvalue @xmath84 .",
    "assume that the hierarchical decomposition of @xmath33 is minimal and that there exists a function @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath52 such that @xmath87 .    in the case",
    "that @xmath43 nothing has to be proved .",
    "hence assume that @xmath88 .",
    "writing ( [ lowest ] ) for both @xmath33 and @xmath89 gives ( to simplify the notation we assume @xmath90 ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the eigenvalues of @xmath30 .",
    "from this pair of equations follows @xmath93 note that @xmath94 implies that @xmath36 is an eigenvector of @xmath0 .",
    "but this is not possible because of the assumption that the hierarchical decomposition of @xmath33 is minimal .",
    "hence , one concludes that @xmath95 .",
    "the proof now continues by induction .",
    "assume that @xmath96 has been proved for some @xmath83 and let us show that this assumption also holds for @xmath97 increased by 1",
    ". from ( [ eigenvalue ] ) follows @xmath98 using the assumption that @xmath99 these equations imply that @xmath100 now , @xmath101 implies that @xmath102 is an eigenvector of @xmath0 .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that the hierarchical decomposition of @xmath33 is minimal .",
    "hence one concludes that @xmath103 .    by induction",
    "one concludes that all @xmath104 are equal .",
    "this finishes the proof of the theorem .",
    "the theorem implies that two eigenvectors @xmath49 and @xmath33 of @xmath0 , belonging to the same multiplet and connected by the operator @xmath105 , can not have the same eigenvalue .",
    "this property is expected because of the wigner - von neumann noncrossing rule .",
    "because @xmath30 commutes with @xmath1 there will be some degeneracies in the spectrum of @xmath1 which disappear when a perturbation @xmath106 is added to @xmath1 .",
    "the noncrossing rule states that those eigenvalues which are degenerated for @xmath107 do not cross each other for any other value of @xmath108 .",
    "now , @xmath108 equals one in the hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the two eigenvalues of @xmath0 , which for @xmath107 are degenerate , must not coincide for @xmath109 .",
    "note however that a multiplet of @xmath0 must not necessarily originate from a degenerate multiplet of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the result of the theorem is not an immediate consequence of the wigner - von neumann noncrossing rule .",
    "analytical expressions for the eigenvalues as functions of the parameter @xmath6 have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "they can also be found using the symbolic software package maple .",
    "the eigenvalues are given in table 1 together with their corresponding degeneracies .

    "it can be seen that there are several crossings between energy levels .",
    "the crossings at @xmath139 are explained by the higher symmetry of the hamiltonian without interaction",
    ". however , there are also some crossings for @xmath140 .",
    "this is similar to the observations of @xcite",
    ".     hubbard ring .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath84 are in arbitrary units .",
    "notice the crossings between the levels .",
    "most crossings occur for @xmath139 but there are also some crossings for other values of @xmath6.,height=321 ]    using ( [ eigenvector ] ) the hilbert space @xmath141 of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be decomposed into subspaces @xmath142 , where each @xmath24 gives a slightly different decomposition . @xmath17 and @xmath143 act as creation and annihilation operators between the subspaces mapping @xmath142 to @xmath144 . in the case of the @xmath2 hubbard ring , the @xmath24 have three eigenvalues ( 0 , 1 and 2 ) so there are three different subspaces . the eigenvalues are then classified by indicating the subspaces @xmath145 on which which the eigenstates have a non - vanishing orthogonal projection .",
    "the first three eigenvalues in table 1 correspond to the states which fall in one of the @xmath145 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates can easily be constructed .",
    "for example the eigenvalue @xmath113 corresponds to @xmath146 with the notation @xmath147 .",
    "this eigenvector falls in @xmath148 , the eigenvector for which @xmath149 falls in @xmath150 and the others in @xmath151 .",
    "the next six eigenvalues , the @xmath114 , @xmath117 and @xmath120 pairs , correspond to the states that for some @xmath152 fall within @xmath153 .",
    "the three pairs each form a doublet of the form discussed in theorem 2 . note that there are no eigenstates in @xmath154 .",
    "the reason for this is that if @xmath155 , then @xmath156 .",
    "thus the hierarchy reduces to the single equation ( [ simple ] ) and the eigenvalue falls into one of the first three classes .",
    "the remaining eigenvalues correspond to triplet states .",
    "the only cases where @xmath9 and @xmath10 give different results is for the triplets @xmath131 and @xmath135 .",
    "using the hierarchy derived from @xmath9 one can not construct the states from the @xmath135 triplet and from @xmath10 one can not construct the @xmath131 triplet .    in figure 2b",
    "it can be seen that within each doublet there are no crossings between energy levels . in figure 2c and 2d",
    "it can be seen that this is also true for the triplets .",
    "this was predicted by theorem 3 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for some models theorem 2 can be generalized in the sense that from one eigenstate @xmath49 others can be constructed by defining a function @xmath105 such that @xmath157 is also an eigenstate .",
    "theorem 2 is a special case where @xmath158 . in @xcite also",
    "an example model was given for which there exists triplets of states that are connected to each other by such functions and thus the corresponding eigenvalues do not cross each other .",
    "this is also the case here for the triplets in the @xmath2 hubbard model although we do not know the explicit expressions for these functions .",
    "using the decomposition of the hamiltonian as described in @xcite , we derive a hierarchy of equations which is equivalent to the eigenvalue equation .",
    "this hierarchy simplifies the calculation of the eigenstates .",
    "its most important feature , however , is that it gives a natural classification of the eigenstates in terms of multiplets .",
    "the first two of our theorems give a method for constructing doublet states which are orthogonal to all but two of the subspaces of @xmath159 . in theorem 1",
    "a method is given to construct the states of such a doublet and theorem 2 gives an expression for the function connecting those states .",
    "a construction similar to the one of theorem 1 can also be done for other states , although for the most general case the calculations may need to be done numerically .",
    "however in the @xmath2 hubbard ring there exist only singlets , doublets and triplets which we could all identify .",
    "finally , theorem 3 states that two eigenvalues belonging to the same multiplet never cross ( for the doublet states this can also easily be seen from ( [ relation ] ) ) .",
    "in conclusion we use an alternative way to define multiplets without using the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "instead we use operators commuting with a reference hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "future work also needs to be done on generalizing our theorems to triplets and more general multiplets .",
