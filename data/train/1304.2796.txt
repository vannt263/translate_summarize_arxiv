    "a discussion of the decay of the false vacuum was began in two pioneer papers by coleman and , callan and coleman @xcite .",
    "_ `` the fate of the false vacuum '' _ was discussed there , namely the unstability of a physical system in a state which is not an absolute minimum of its energy density , and which is separated from the minimum by an effective potential barrier .",
    "it was shown , in those papers , that even if the state of the early universe is too cold to activate a `` _ thermal _ '' transition ( via thermal fluctuations ) to the lowest energy ( i.e. _ `` true vacuum '' _ ) state , a quantum decay from the false vacuum to the true vacuum may still be possible through a barrier penetration via macroscopic quantum tunneling . not long ago",
    ", the decay of the false vacuum state in a cosmological context has attracted renewed interest , especially in view of its possible relevance in the process of tunneling among the many vacuum states of the string landscape ( a set of vacua in the low energy approximation of string theory ) .    since the work of khalfin @xcite it is known that for long times compared to the characteristic decay time of an unstable state ( when the decay law has an exponential form ) , the survival probability of such states is no longer described by an exponential function of time @xmath2 but it decreases as @xmath3 more slowly than any exponential function of @xmath2 .",
    "krauss and dent analyzing a false vacuum decay @xcite pointed out that in eternal inflation , even though regions of false vacua by assumption should decay exponentially , gravitational effects force space in a region that has not decayed yet to grow exponentially fast .",
    "this effect causes that many false vacuum regions can survive up to the times much later than times when the exponential decay law holds . in the mentioned paper by krauss and",
    "dent the attention was focused on the possible behavior of the unstable false vacuum at very late times , where deviations from the exponential decay law become to be dominat . in our paper",
    "the attention will be focussed on properties of decaying false vacuum states from the point of view of the quantum theory of unstable states evolving in time and decaying .",
    "it will be shown that at late times the instantaneous energy of the false vacuum states tends to the energy of the true vacuum state as @xmath0 for @xmath1 .",
    "this means that in the case of such false vacuum states the cosmological constant becomes time depending .",
    "next effective cosmological model with obtained decaying lambda term will be studied in details .",
    "if @xmath4 is an initial unstable state then the survival probability , @xmath5 , equals @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the survival amplitude , @xmath8 , and @xmath9\\,|m\\rangle$ ] , @xmath10 is the total hamiltonian of the system under considerations .",
    "the spectrum , @xmath11 , of @xmath10 is assumed to be bounded from below , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    from basic principles of quantum theory",
    "it is known that the amplitude @xmath7 , and thus the decay law @xmath14 of the unstable state @xmath4 , are completely determined by the density of the energy distribution function @xmath15 for the system in this state @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 . from this last condition and from the paley ",
    "wiener theorem it follows that there must be ( see @xcite ) @xmath20 $ ] , for @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the decay law @xmath14 of unstable states decaying in the vacuum can not be described by an exponential function of time @xmath2 if time @xmath2 is suitably long , @xmath24 , and that for these lengths of time @xmath25 tends to zero as @xmath26 more slowly than any exponential function of @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis of the models of the decay processes shows that @xmath27 $ ] , ( where @xmath28 is the decay rate of the state @xmath29 ) , to an very high accuracy at the canonical decay times @xmath2 : from @xmath2 suitably later than the initial instant @xmath30 up to @xmath31 and smaller than @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the crossover time and denotes the time @xmath2 for which the non  exponential deviations of @xmath7 begin to dominate .    in general , in the case of quasi ",
    "stationary ( metastable ) states it is convenient to express @xmath7 in the following form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the exponential part of @xmath7 , that is @xmath36 $ ] , ( @xmath37 is the energy of the system in the state @xmath4 measured at the canonical decay times , @xmath38 is the normalization constant ) , and @xmath39 is the non  exponential part of @xmath7 . for times",
    "@xmath41 ,    the crossover time @xmath33 can be found by solving the following equation , @xmath42 the amplitude @xmath39 exhibits inverse power  law behavior at the late time region : @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , the integral representation ( [ a - spec ] ) of @xmath7 means that @xmath7 is the fourier transform of the energy distribution function @xmath44 .",
    "using this fact we can find asymptotic form of @xmath7 for @xmath26 .",
    "results are rigorous .",
    "let us consider @xmath45 having universal and general form .",
    "namely let @xmath46 be of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and it is assumed that @xmath49 and derivatives @xmath50 , ( @xmath51 ) , exist and they are continuous in @xmath52 , and limits @xmath53 exist , @xmath54 for all above mentioned @xmath55 , then @xmath56           = a_{non}(t ) .              \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the amplitude @xmath7 contains information about the decay law @xmath14 of the state @xmath4 , that is about the decay rate @xmath28 of this state , as well as the energy @xmath57 of the system in this state .",
    "this information can be extracted from @xmath7 . indeed if @xmath4 is an unstable ( a quasi ",
    "stationary ) state then @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "so , there is @xmath59 in the case of quasi  stationary states .    taking the above into account",
    "one can define the `` effective hamiltonian '' , @xmath60 , for the one  dimensional subspace of states @xmath61 spanned by the normalized vector @xmath4 as follows @xmath62 in general , @xmath60 can depend on time @xmath2 , @xmath63 .",
    "one meets this effective hamiltonian when one starts with the schrdinger equation for the total state space @xmath64 and looks for the rigorous evolution equation for the distinguished subspace of states @xmath65 .",
    "details can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "thus , one finds the following expressions for the energy and the decay rate of the system in the state @xmath4 under considerations , to be more precise for the instantaneous energy @xmath66 and the instantaneous decay rate , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the real and imaginary parts of @xmath72 respectively .    using ( [ h ] )",
    "one can find that @xmath73 , @xmath74 , i. e. , there is @xmath75 at the canonical decay time .",
    "starting from the asymptotic expression ( [ a - eta ] ) for @xmath7 and using ( [ h ] ) after some algebra one finds for times @xmath43 that @xmath76 where @xmath77 ; ( coefficients @xmath78 depend on @xmath79 ) .",
    "this last relation means that @xmath80 ( here @xmath81 ) .",
    "these properties take place for all unstable states which survived up to times @xmath43 . from ( [ e(t ) ] ) it follows that @xmath82 .",
    "krauss and dent in their paper @xcite mentioned earlier made a hypothesis that some false vacuum regions do survive well up to the time @xmath33 or later .",
    "let @xmath83 , be a false,@xmath84  a true , vacuum states and @xmath85 be the energy of a state corresponding to the false vacuum measured at the canonical decay time and @xmath86 be the energy of true vacuum ( i.e. the true ground state of the system ) . as it is seen from the results presented in previous section ,",
    "the problem is that the energy of those false vacuum regions which survived up to @xmath33 and much later differs from @xmath85 , ( see @xcite and references one can find therein ) .",
    "going from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory one should take into account among others a volume factors so that survival probabilities per unit volume per unit time should be considered .",
    "the standard false vacuum decay calculations shows that the same volume factors should appear in both early and late time decay rate estimates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the calculations of cross  over time @xmath33 can be applied to survival probabilities per unit volume . for the same reasons within the quantum field theory the quantity @xmath66 can be replaced by the energy per unit volume @xmath87 because these volume factors appear in the numerator and denominator of the formula ( 10 ) for @xmath88 .",
    "now , if one assumes that @xmath89 then one has for the energy of the false vacuum state that at @xmath43 , @xmath90 this property of the false vacuum states means that @xmath91    the basic physical factor forcing the wave function @xmath92 and thus the amplitude @xmath7 to exhibit inverse power law behavior at @xmath43 is a boundedness from below of @xmath93 .",
    "this means that if this condition takes place and @xmath94 , then all properties of @xmath7 , including a form of the time  dependence at @xmath43 , are the mathematical consequence of them both .",
    "the same applies by ( [ h ] ) to properties of @xmath88 and concerns the asymptotic form of @xmath88 and thus of @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath43 .",
    "note that properties of @xmath7 and @xmath88 discussed above do not take place when @xmath95 .",
    "the late time behavior of the energy of the system in the false vacuum state , @xmath96 or , of the energy density @xmath97 : @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 ) , is the pure quantum effect following from the basic principles of the quantum theory .",
    "the standard relation is @xmath100 .",
    "let us take into account properties of the false vacuum described by the last relations and let us consider the cosmological model which is homogeneous and isotropic ( possesses the robertson - walker metric ) in which energy density of dark sector is given by the relation which consists of the bare cosmological constant @xmath101 and the term depending on the cosmological time @xmath2 @xmath102 as it is well know the friedmann - robertson - walker model has a first integral which does not depend on the pressure @xmath103 and is given in the form called the friedmann equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the hubble parameter , @xmath2 is the cosmological time and @xmath106 is a scale factor .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that space is flat and matter is in the form of dust ( @xmath107 ) , so @xmath108 describes a dependence of the energy density of the matter on a scale factor or a redshift @xmath109 .",
    "therefore ( [ rho - de ] ) and ( [ f - eq ] ) give @xmath110 next we introduce the state variables ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath72 ) defined as @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the quantities @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath72 has the cosmological sense of density parameters for a matter , the cosmological constant and for the which mimics time dependence of the false decaying vacuum .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath101 is assumed to be positive . above variables , of course ,",
    "satisfy the constrain @xmath116 . using this constrain after some algebra we obtain for state variables @xmath117 dynamical system in the phase space @xmath118 , ( i.e. on the unit sphere ) , having the following form : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and the cosmological time @xmath2",
    "is reparametrized to the new time parameter @xmath121 which is a monotonic function of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "the above system has three 2d invariant submanifolds : @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and the following critical points :    1 .",
