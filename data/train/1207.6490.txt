    "polynomial optimization problems have been widely studied in various fields such as nonlinear algebra , semidefinite programming , and operations research , with extensive applications in production planning , location and distribution , engineering design , risk management , water treatment and distribution , chemical process design , pooling and blending , structural design , signal processing , robust stability analysis , design of chips , and much more ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ due to the nonconvexity , traditional direct methods for solving polynomial optimization problems are usually very difficult , or even impossible .",
    "for example , the algebraic method for the task is to find all of the critical points firstly and then to identify the global minimizer(s ) among all these critical points .",
    "this approach becomes inefficient when there exist numerous local minima .",
    "also , linearization and relaxation techniques were used to compute an approximate optimal solution of the primal problem .",
    "however , the approximate optimal solution was not guaranteed to be the actual global optimum @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the so - called z - eigenvalue methods were proposed to solve the best rank - one approximation problem , but they can be applied only for third - order polynomials .",
    "besides these deterministic methods , stochastic techniques have also made significant contributions to the optimization applications of this kind @xcite .",
    "for example , the evolutionary computation method , could solve general problems in low dimension , but it failed to do well for large scale ones @xcite . generally speaking , due to the lack of a theory for",

    "+ the canonical duality theory was originated in the late 1980s by gao and strang , and has developed significantly in recent years , both theoretically and practically @xcite .",

    "was completely solved by the canonical duality theory . in @xcite ,",
    "the theory was used to solve a special 8__th _ _ order polynomial minimization problem . recently , canonical dual solutions to sum of fourth - order polynomials minimization problems have also achieved @xcite .",
    "this paper aims to solve some general polynomial benchmark problems by using a generalized canonical duality theory .",
    "experimental results show that these polynomial benchmark problems can be solved completely by the canonical duality theory .",
