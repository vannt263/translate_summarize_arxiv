    "correlation femtoscopy @xcite is a tool to study the spatiotemporal structure of particle emission in nucleus - nucleus , proton-(anti)proton and proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "this structure is correlated with the dynamics of the collision processes @xcite which can hence be studied with interferometry tools .",
    "the corresponding femtoscopic patterns can be presented in different forms .",
    "one is the @xmath4-momentum dependence of the interferometry radii @xmath5 , that results from a 3d gaussian fit in @xmath6 of the two - particle correlation function @xmath7 , defined as a ratio of the two - particle spectrum to the product of the single - particle ones .",
    "the other one is the source function @xmath8 reflecting the dependence of the pair production on the distance @xmath9 between the two emitted particles in the rest frame of the pair .",
    "both patterns supplement each other , and a reliable model should describe / predict all the mentioned types of the femtoscopic observables , if it contains a detailed space - time picture of the collision process .",
    "it is important to note that the correlation function behavior depends also on the particle species .",
    "the detailed behavior of this dependence can can be used to discriminate between different scenarios of the matter evolution and particle emission in the collision processes .",
    "for example , the hydrodynamic picture of a+a collisions for the particular case of negligible transverse flow leads to the same @xmath10 behavior of the longitudinal radii @xmath11 for identical pions and kaons , and even gives the complete @xmath12-scaling in the case of common freeze - out @xcite is the transverse mass of the particle pair . ] . in simple analytical models",
    "a deviation from such a scaling can be a signal of enhanced transverse flow @xcite and/or different ( effective ) freeze - out times , e.g. , because kaons are less affected by the decay of resonances than pions at the afterburner stage .",
    "the last factor could , in principle , also affect differences in femtoscopic scales between charged identical kaon pairs and @xmath2 , and corresponding theoretical estimates and comparison with experimental data are to the point here .",
    "note that , in spite of analytical approximations , in realistic hybrid or hydrokinetic models many factors act simultaneously and the results can be obtained only by time - consuming numerical calculations .",
    "the hydrokinetic model ( hkm ) @xcite was developed to describe simultaneously a wide class of bulk observables in a+a collisions at top rhic and lhc energies , to predict pion , kaon , proton , as well as all charged , particle spectra for all centralities , @xmath13 coefficients and pion femtoscopy scales @xcite .",
    "also the pion and kaon source functions at the same initial conditions were well described at top rhic energy , and predictions for lhc were done @xcite .",
    "in addition , hkm well describes pion interferometry radii in p+p collision at lhc ( @xmath14 tev ) energy if one incorporates the quantum uncertainty principle into a quasi - classical event generator @xcite .    in this work",
    "we apply hkm to workout and predict different kaon femtoscopy scales at lhc energy in pb+pb ( @xmath1 tev ) collisions at the same parameter values as those used in @xcite .",
    "the predictions for kaon and pion interferometry radii at full lhc energy ( @xmath15 tev ) are demonstrated also .",
    "the kaon and pion femtoscopy analysis gives the possibility to clarify whether the resulting spatiotemporal structure of emission functions for different particle species , that describe well the bulk observables at lhc , is self - consistent and reliable .",
    "then this picture of particle emission will serve as a reference point no matter how much advanced future models will be developed .",
    "the hydrokinetic model @xcite was developed to simulate the evolution of matter formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the full process proceeds through stages  a high density medium expansion , described in the ideal hydrodynamics approximation , then gradual system decoupling , described in the hydrokinetic approach .",
    "the final stage is a hadronic cascade within urqmd . at the first stage matter",
    "is assumed to be in local chemical and thermal equilibrium .",
    "here we use a lattice - qcd inspired equation of state for the quark - gluon phase @xcite , matched via a cross - over type transition with the hadron resonance gas , consisting of all 329 well - established hadron states made out of u , d , s quarks .",
    "as the system expands and cools down , it reaches the second stage , which begins at the chemical freeze - out isotherm @xmath16  mev @xcite mev @xcite for lhc energy @xmath17 tev in thermal model that ignores inelastic processes at afterburner stage except decays of resonances . ] . at temperatures @xmath18 system gradually falls out of both chemical and thermal equilibrium , and the particles",
    "begin to continuously escape from the medium . in the hybrid model version ( hhkm )",
    "@xcite the hydrokinetic description of the second stage is switched to the urqmd hadron cascade on a space - like hypersurface , situated behind the hadronization phase .",
    "another option is a direct switching to the cascade just from the hydrodynamic stage , at the hadronization hypersurface @xmath16  mev .",
    "we use this particular variant in the current analysis , relying on the result of @xcite , where the comparison with data of one- and two - particle spectra , calculated at both types of matching hydro and cascade stages , showed a rather small difference between them in the considered case of top rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the reason for the similarity is that , for the utilized event - averaged initial conditions , the contribution from the loss of particles crossing non - space - like sectors which match the hydro - urqmd hypersurface is quite small , @xmath19  percent .",
    "this is related to the very high velocities ( @xmath20 ) of the fluid elements crossing non - space - like parts of the chemical freeze - out isotherm .",
    "then the number of the particles that move inside the fluid belongs to a tail of the relativistic ( boltzmann ) spectra and their negative contributions in the cooper - frye formula @xcite are negligible .    at the switching hypersurface a set of particles is generated according to the chemical freeze - out distribution function @xcite using either cooper - frye prescription @xcite ( for sudden switching from hydro to urqmd ) or using the technique of boltzmann equations in integral form @xcite ( if hydrokinetics is involved ) .",
    "this set serves as input for urqmd @xcite , within which particles rescatter and decay .",
    "the final model output is again a collection of particles , characterized by their momenta and the points of their last collisions .     and @xmath21 interferometry radii @xmath22 on @xmath4 for @xmath17  tev pb+pb lhc collisions , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25  gev/@xmath26.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we work in the central rapidity slice and assume longitudinal boost - invariance .",
    "this is well fulfilled at lhc energy @xcite .",
    "early thermalization at proper time @xmath27 fm / c is assumed . in the transverse plane",
    "we use glauber monte carlo initial energy density profile generated in the glissando code @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the initial conditions tilt in each event the principal axes of the ellipse of inertia and shift the center of mass relative to the reaction - plane coordinate system . to account for this effect , we superimpose the principal axes by rotation and recentering of each initial distribution and after that take averages over the ensemble of events ( so - called variable geometry analysis , also implemented as an option in the glissando code ) .",
    "so we use event - averaged initial conditions . we assume zero and small but non - zero initial transverse flow which is taken linear in transverse radius @xmath28 @xcite : @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the system s homogeneity length in @xmath31-direction , we take it as the r.m.s . @xmath32 along the azimuthal angle @xmath31 .",
    "such a small initial flow mimics shear viscosity effects during the system hydrodynamic evolution as well as effects of event by event fluctuating hydro - solutions @xcite .",
    "the maximal initial energy density @xmath33 is chosen to reproduce the experimental ( or predicted for full lhc energy ) mean charged particle multiplicity .",
    "thus , @xmath33 and the coefficient @xmath34 are the only fitting parameters of the model which are attributed to the initial time 0.1 fm / c .",
    "we take the parameters from @xcite that provide the best fit for the charged particle multiplicity , pion , kaon and proton spectra and pion interferometry data , @xmath35  gev/@xmath36 and @xmath37  fm ( the maximal initial transverse velocity at the very periphery of the system is then 0.05 ) .",
    "we also demonstrate the results with no initial transverse flow .     and @xmath21 parameter @xmath38 on @xmath4 for @xmath39  gev pb+pb lhc collisions , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25  gev/@xmath26.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "at the initial conditions described in the previous section we calculate within hkm the interferometry radii @xmath22 for charged and neutral kaon correlation functions @xmath40 where @xmath4 is the absolute value of half - momentum of the pair .",
    "the kaon pairs are generated in central @xmath41 lhc pb+pb collisions at the energy @xmath17  tev .",
    "the particles with transverse momentum in the range @xmath25  gev/@xmath26 and pseudorapidity @xmath24 were chosen for the analysis .",
    "the results of the gaussian fits , @xmath42 , are presented in fig .",
    "one can see there also the interferometry radii for the case without initial transverse flow , @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath44 is a non - gaussian function , the parameter @xmath38 is small comparing with the intercept of the correlation function and it decreases with @xmath4 as one can see in fig .",
    "[ lam1d ] .",
    "we demonstrate in addition the @xmath4-behavior of @xmath38 when there is no initial transverse flow and also for the artificial case when the resonances @xmath45 and @xmath46 decay just on the hypersurface of the chemical freeze - out",
    ". as one can see such an `` exclusion'' of the resonances almost does not affect the femtoscopy scales .",
    "that is the main reason why the interferometry radii for charged and neutral kaons practically coincide .",
    "and @xmath21 3d interferometry radii @xmath47 on @xmath4 for @xmath39  gev pb+pb lhc collisions , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25  gev/@xmath26.,scaledwidth=108.0% ]    -dependencies for @xmath48 , @xmath21 and @xmath49 parameter @xmath50 for @xmath17  tev pb+pb lhc collisions , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25  gev/@xmath26.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ kk3d ] we show plots of the @xmath4-dependence of 3d @xmath47 interferometry radii and of the ratio @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "these radius parameters are extracted from gaussian fits to @xmath48 and @xmath21 correlation function histograms calculated in the hydrokinetic model .",
    "the dependence on @xmath4 of the kaon suppression parameter @xmath50 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ kklam ] in comparison with the corresponding result for pions .",
    "opposite to the case of kaons , the contribution of pions from long - lived resonance decays is significant , so the suppression parameter @xmath50 is significantly less for pions and it noticeably grows with @xmath4 since the contribution from these resonances is reduced with @xmath4 because of kinematics .",
    "in addition , in fig . [ k - pi ] we compare the @xmath12 behavior of @xmath47 for charged identical kaons with that the model gives for identical charged pions .",
    "we see that the hydrokinetic model does not result in @xmath12-scaling for the pion and kaon _",
    "side- _ interferometry radii , with kaon radii larger than values for pions at the same @xmath12 .",
    "the deviation from the scaling behavior is especially significant in the _",
    "long- _ direction that is a consequence of strong transverse flow @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ k - pi2 ] we demonstrate the hkm predictions for full lhc energy @xmath53  tev in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the maximal initial energy density @xmath33 is chosen to reproduce the predicted mean charged particle multiplicity , taken from @xcite .",
    "the initial flow is absent , @xmath43 .",
    "the presented interferometry radii of kaons and pions demonstrate @xmath4-scaling for pion and kaon interferometry radii that starts from @xmath54 gev for _ long_-radius and takes place for @xmath55 gev for @xmath56- and @xmath57- directions .",
    "the scaling is predicted also for pb+pb collisions at @xmath17  tev , but corresponding radii values are @xmath58 lower for kaons and @xmath59 lower for pions than for full lhc energy .",
    "the predictions of the hydrokinetic model are presented for the 1d and 3d interferometry radii of neutral and charged kaons in @xmath0 collisions at the lhc current energy @xmath1 tev and at the planning full energy @xmath60 .",
    "the magnitude of interferometry radii for charged and neutral kaons is very similar .",
    "the correlation functions do not have a purely gaussian shape , especially for the 1d case resulting in the `` suppression '' parameter @xmath50 being less than the intercept of the correlation functions and even in a decrease with transverse momentum of the pairs in the 1d case . partially because of this the parameter and radii practically are not sensitive to effects of @xmath61 and @xmath31 decays as was confirmed by an analysis assuming the artificial exclusion of the decays . a small contribution from these decays",
    "also sheds light on the near coincidence of the results for neutral and charged kaons .",
    "another feature of the predictions of the hydrokinetic model is absence of @xmath12- scaling for pion and kaon interferometry radii .",
    "there is a significant violation of the scaling for the _",
    "long- _ projection of the interferometry radii , that is caused , most likely , by strong transverse flow @xcite .",
    "however in the region of transverse pair momentum @xmath62 gev the @xmath4-scaling is predicted by hkm .",
    "this is the result of the interplay of many different factors in the model , including the particular initial conditions",
    ".    it will be very instructive to compare our predictions to data from alice experiment .",
    "the final aim is a quantitative characterization of the expansion and freeze - out dynamics of the fireball formed in central @xmath0 collisions at the lhc .",
