    "although we only work with the beurling transform and its iterations , we begin by considering the question for more general caldern - zygmund singular operators .",
    "let @xmath12 be a smooth homogeneous caldern - zygmund singular integral operator on  @xmath13 with kernel @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a homogeneous function of degree 0 whose restriction to the unit sphere @xmath16 is @xmath17 and satisfies the cancellation property @xmath18 @xmath19 being the normalized surface measure in @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the principal value convolution operator @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the truncated operator at level @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 for @xmath25 , the limit in exists for almost all @xmath26 .",
    "one says that the operator @xmath12 is even ( or odd ) if the kernel is even ( or odd ) , that is , if @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "let @xmath30 be the maximal singular integral @xmath31 the classical cotlar s inequality ( e.g.  @xcite ) asserts that @xmath32 where @xmath5 denotes the hardy  littlewood maximal operator . in @xcite",
    "one proved the pointwise inequality @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the beurling transform of @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 @xmath37 denoting the 2-dimensional lebesgue measure . the work @xcite addresses the issue of characterizing even smooth homogeneous caldern  zygmund operators for which the inequality is true .",
    "in particular , it shows that @xmath38 , @xmath39 , if and only if @xmath40 , @xmath41 . the analogous question for odd operators",
    "is treated in @xcite , showing that @xmath42 , @xmath39 , if and only if @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "( see @xcite for an @xmath43 version of these results . )    in the definition of the truncated operator @xmath22 we are taking the kernel @xmath44 outside a ball of radius @xmath8 .",
    "we also could define a truncation outside a cube of sidelength @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the cube , with sides parallel to axis , centered at @xmath26 of side length @xmath8 and define @xmath46 and consider the associated maximal singular integral @xmath47 by simple geometry one checks that @xmath48 and therefore @xmath49 consequently , from the @xmath43-theory point of view , the maximal operators @xmath30 and @xmath50 are equivalent . on the other hand , we wonder if there is any pointwise inequality that relates @xmath51 with @xmath52 like in .",
    "in this note we provide an answer for the beurling transform defined in and for its @xmath53th iteration @xmath54 .",
    "the fourier multiplier of @xmath2 is @xmath55 , or in other words , @xmath56 and then @xmath2 is an isometry on @xmath57 .",
    "the kernel @xmath58 of @xmath59 may be computed explicitly , for instance via a fourier transform argument @xcite , and one obtains @xmath60 similarly we get that the kernel of the inverse operator , @xmath61 , is precisely the conjugate kernel : @xmath62 .",
    "a.   if @xmath53 is odd , then @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a constant depending on @xmath53 and @xmath10 the iterated maximal operator . b.   if @xmath53 is even , for any positive constant @xmath64 , for any @xmath1 and for any positive integer @xmath65 there exists a function @xmath35 in @xmath66 such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath65th iteration of @xmath5 .",
    "notice that in the right hand side of there is the maximal operator , but in  ( a ) of the theorem the iteration of @xmath5 appears .",
    "the reason is that @xmath69 is a bounded function with compact support , but @xmath70 is an unbounded bmo function without compact support .",
    "we also provide an example to show that in part ( a ) of the above theorem for @xmath71 we can not replace the iterated hardy  littlewood maximal operator @xmath72 by @xmath5 .",
    "we believe that similar examples should also give optimality for the case @xmath73 .",
    "property ( b ) of the theorem is also satisfied for the cauchy transform on a lipschitz graph when the graph is not a line ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we adhere to the usual convention of denoting by @xmath64 a positive constant , independent of the relevant parameters involved , and which may vary from an occurrence to another .",
    "our notation and terminology are standard .",
    "for example , @xmath74 means that the two quantities @xmath75 and @xmath2 satisfy the relation @xmath76 , for some constant @xmath77 .",
    "we proceed as in @xcite . by translating and dilating one",
    "reduces the proof to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the truncated integral at level 2 . denote the square @xmath80\\times [ -1,1]$ ] by @xmath81 . as usual",
    ", @xmath82 denotes the characteristic function of the set  @xmath83 .",
    "the idea is to obtain an identity of the form @xmath84 for some function @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath59 is an invertible operator , we have @xmath86 and so @xmath87 . we claim that if @xmath53 is odd we have the decay estimate @xmath88 before proving the claim we show how it yields ( a ) of the theorem .",
    "we argue as in @xcite . for any @xmath89",
    "we have @xmath90 where , as usual , @xmath91 . to estimate the term @xmath92 we use the generalized hlder s inequality and the pointwise equivalence @xmath93 ( @xcite ) to get @xmath94 clearly , @xmath95 finally , from the decay of @xmath85 we obtain @xmath96 by using a standard argument which consists in estimating the integral on the annuli @xmath97",
    ". therefore we get and part ( a ) of the theorem is proved .",
    "now we turn to the proof of the claim .",
    "we express @xmath85 as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the dirac delta at the origin .",
    "we have to determine the decay of @xmath100 when @xmath101 : @xmath102 on the one hand , since @xmath103 we obtain @xmath104 on the other hand , we will check in the next lemma that when @xmath53 is odd @xmath105 .",
    "then @xmath106 and so we get .",
    "let q be any square , with sides parallel to axis , centered at @xmath107 . then    a.   @xmath108 . b.   @xmath109 .",
    "c.   @xmath110 if @xmath53 is odd , and @xmath111 if @xmath53 is even .",
    "it is easy to check ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "just consider the symmetry of the domain with respect to conjugation and with respect to rotation of angle @xmath112 : @xmath113 and @xmath114 from ( b ) , when @xmath53 is odd , we have @xmath115 and so @xmath110 . to get @xmath111 when @xmath53 is even we have to work a little more .",
    "set @xmath116 and by simplicity let @xmath117 be the square @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "the second equality follows from the cancellation of the kernels and the third one from @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , making the change to polar coordinates @xmath121 , with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , we have @xmath125 expressing @xmath126 in terms of @xmath127 and @xmath128 and replacing @xmath129 and @xmath130 we write @xmath131 & = \\frac{-4}{\\pi}\\sum_{m=0}^{2j-1 } ( -1)^m \\binom{4j}{2m+1 }   \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{2m+2}}{(x^2 + 1)^{2j+1}}\\ , dx \\\\*[5pt ] & : =   \\frac{-4}{\\pi } \\int_{0}^{1 } f_j(x ) \\ , dx . \\end{split}\\ ] ] integrating by parts as many times as necessary , one easily obtains , for some @xmath132 , @xmath133 although each factor in is non - zero , there still might be a cancellation in the sum on @xmath134 .",
    "we will check that @xmath135 proving that a primitive of @xmath136 is some rational function @xmath137 with integer coefficients minus @xmath138 .",
    "thus we will have @xmath139 because @xmath140 will be a rational number .",
    "given @xmath141 , we define @xmath142 it is not necessary to fix the constant of the primitive because we will value a definite integral .",
    "integrating by parts we have @xmath143 iterating the procedure we obtain @xmath144 where @xmath145 is some rational function defined on @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "given @xmath148 one easily gets @xmath149 now , from together with and , @xmath150 performing some computations ( see the appendix ) , we get exactly what we wanted , @xmath151 that is , @xmath152    let us prove assertion ( b ) of the theorem .",
    "recall that now @xmath53 is even . by one",
    "has @xmath153 if and only if @xmath154 by , when @xmath101 , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is a non - zero constant that depends on @xmath53 . consequently , holds if and only if @xmath157 since that @xmath59 is invertible in @xmath158 , this is equivalent to @xmath159 but is false .",
    "indeed , let @xmath160 be a function with compact support and @xmath161 .",
    "obviously , @xmath162 .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath163 does not belong to @xmath164 , we can make the left - hand side of as big as we want .",
    "this section is devoted to prove that condition ( a ) in the theorem is sharp for @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , we will prove that there exists a function @xmath35 such that for each constant @xmath165 there exists a point @xmath166 satisfying @xmath167    we choose @xmath168 . for @xmath169 one",
    "has @xmath170 .",
    "so , in order to get inequality it is sufficient to prove that , for some @xmath171 , one has @xmath172    for @xmath173 ( for instance , @xmath174 ) ,",
    "take @xmath175 , set @xmath176 and consider the truncated operator @xmath177 by definition @xmath178 and then we will have if we prove @xmath179 the idea is to decompose @xmath180 as a sum of certain terms .",
    "all terms , except one , can be bounded by @xmath181 and the exceptional term will be of order @xmath182 .",
    "we begin by writing the equality @xmath183 where @xmath83 is the set @xmath184 . from the pointwise inequality   the fisrt term",
    "is bounded by @xmath185 and we just care about the second one . set @xmath186 where ( see figure 1 ) @xmath187     + figure 1    thus @xmath188 on the set @xmath2 we have @xmath189 and then @xmath190 so , to get it remains to prove that @xmath191 for any @xmath192 we write @xmath193 by the mean value property , the last integral in the above equality is bounded by  @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , an easy computation gives @xmath195 consequently , inequality holds if and only if @xmath196 notice that , by the symmetry of the sets , @xmath197 if and only if @xmath198 .",
    "thus the integral in can be written as @xmath199 set @xmath200 , @xmath201 and let @xmath202 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 2    first of all we prove that the integral over @xmath203 is bounded by @xmath185 . using a change of variable in the integral over @xmath204",
    ", one can see that the integral over @xmath205 is @xmath206 we are going to estimate @xmath207 and @xmath208 by @xmath185 .",
    "indeed , @xmath209 where in the first inequality we have used that @xmath210 , and in the second one that @xmath211 .",
    "using similar computations for the second term we get @xmath212 so , only remains to compute the integral over @xmath213 , which we split again into two terms , @xmath214 + \\int_{d}\\frac{1}{w^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{(z - w)^2}-\\frac{1}{(z - i\\overline{w})^2}\\right)\\ , dw & : = iii+iv .",

    "for @xmath215 ( see figure 3 ) we write @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "so , @xmath223",
    ". then we have @xmath224 & = -2\\int_{d}\\frac{(\\cos2\\theta(w)+i\\sin2\\theta(w))}{r^2(w)}\\frac{\\operatorname{im } w^2}{|w|^4}\\ , dw .",

    "note that the lebesgue measure of @xmath233 is comparable to the lebesgue measure of @xmath213 .",
    "finally , using polar coordinates we get @xmath234 which yields and the counterexample .",
    "in this section we will prove , for the sake of the reader s convenience , identity . to get it we will write the term in the left hand side of in another way .",
    "that is , @xmath235 & \\hspace{3.5cm}=\\frac{(4j)!}{(2j)!(2j-1)!2^{4j-1}}\\sum_{m=0}^{2j-1}(-1)^m\\binom{2j-1}{m}\\frac{1}{4j-2m-1}\\\\*[5pt ] & \\hspace{3.5cm}:= \\frac{(4j)!}{(2j)!(2j-1)!2^{4j-1 } } \\ ; s , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the last identity defines @xmath236 .",
