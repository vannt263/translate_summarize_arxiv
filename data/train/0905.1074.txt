    "with the upcoming start of the lhc in mind , we consider the possibility of looking for @xmath1 violation in high energy processes involving the production and decay of top quarks .",
    "there are many observables suitable for this purpose that have been studied before in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider @xmath0 odd triple product correlations of the sort first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we keep our study as model independent as possible by considering a scenario in which only the standard model ( sm ) particles are relevant and the @xmath1 violation is parametrized by anomalous top - quark couplings affecting both the production and decay vertices @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 production process is modified relative to the sm by the interaction @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath6 is the usual gluon field strength tensor .",
    "this interaction results in a modification to the @xmath7 vertex as well as in an additional , `` seagull '' , @xmath8 vertex . for the decay process",
    "@xmath9 we write the most general decay vertex ( and the corresponding one for @xmath10 decay ) , @xmath11 u(p_t ) .",
    "\\label{ftilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this vertex can be derived from a dimension five effective lagrangian as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but unlike the case of eq .",
    "[ dtilde ] , the effective lagrangian does not generate other vertices that affect this calculation .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we will use @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 as in the sm , and allow for new physics only through the coupling @xmath16 which is the only one that can interfere with the sm to produce @xmath0-odd correlations.to generate @xmath0-odd observables the coupling @xmath16 must have a phase but this phase does not have to be @xmath1 violating .",
    "we thus write @xmath17 using @xmath18 to parametrize a @xmath1 violating phase due to new physics and @xmath19 a @xmath1 conserving phase arising from real intermediate states at the loop level .",
    "some of these @xmath1 violating couplings have also been studied in the context of a future linear collider  @xcite .",
    "our study in this paper corresponds to the numerical implementation of the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where comparisons to the previous literature were made @xcite .",
    "we start from eqs .  10  and  32 of ref .",
    "@xcite which give the spin and color averaged matrix element squared containing the @xmath0 odd triple product correlations for the process @xmath20 .",
    "for convenience we collect the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the appendix .",
    "numerical studies similar to ours have been carried out before for a subset of the observables we consider here , and we compare our results to the most recent ones in the literature @xcite .",
    "the numerical studies are performed with the aid of madgraph @xcite .",
    "@xcite three independent correlations were identified to test @xmath1 violation in @xmath3 production . here we rewrite them with a small modification : we have reshuffled factors of @xmath21 between the form factors and the correlations to ensure that both the form factor and the correlation are even under the interchange of the two initial protons .",
    "we concentrate initially on @xmath22 decaying into muons , for which the @xmath0-odd correlations are with the sign convention @xmath23",
    ". we also use @xmath24 to refer to the parton level mandelstam variables for @xmath25 . ] : @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the difference and sum of the incoming parton momenta .",
    "the spin and color averaged matrix element squared that contains these correlations is given by , @xmath29 where the form factors @xmath30 were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we reproduce them in the appendix for convenience .",
    "we begin by studying each of the three terms in eq .",
    "[ formfactors ] separately , considering the lab frame distributions @xmath31 for the three correlations . in each case",
    "we isolate the @xmath1 odd form factor @xmath32 by constructing the integrated counting asymmetry @xmath33    the observables used to construct the @xmath34 are not realistic in that not all the momenta appearing in them can be reconstructed . to address this issue we replace those observables assuming that for each event it is only possible to reconstruct the momenta of the two muons @xmath35 , the two @xmath36 jets , and the beam direction .",
    "the correlations under this assumption can be obtained from eq .",
    "[ prodco ] with the substitutions @xmath37 we have defined a four - vector @xmath38 , as the difference between the two beam four - momenta . the factor @xmath21 could get modified by writing it as @xmath39 with the substitutions implied by eq .",
    "[ repls ] .",
    "however , all one needs is a factor linear in @xmath38 so we choose the simpler form @xmath40 .",
    "all this results in the correlations @xmath41 , @xmath42 and their associated counting asymmetries @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that the correlation @xmath44 gives rise to both @xmath45 and @xmath46 . from the experimental perspective , @xmath47 is most desirable as it is the only one that does not require distinguishing between the @xmath48 and @xmath49 jets .",
    "when @xmath1 violation occurs in the decay vertex , the spin and color averaged matrix element squared containing the @xmath0-odd correlations was written in ref .  @xcite as   and @xmath19 are reversed . ]",
    "@xmath50 all the terms in eq .",
    "[ asymcpdec ] contain three four - momenta from one of the decay vertices so the correlations @xmath51 defined previously may not be the best to measure these couplings .",
    "guided by the form of eq .",
    "[ asymcpdec ] , we define the following three correlations for this purpose @xmath52 these three correlations explicitly show that in order to test for @xmath1 violation in the decay vertex it is necessary to compare the decay of the top quark with that of the anti - top quark .",
    "this is accomplished in eq .",
    "[ decayco ] with the use of the linear combinations of @xmath53 as well as @xmath54 .",
    "these constructions are @xmath1-odd , and as such they isolate the phase @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ asymcpdec ] . later on we discuss alternative constructions to isolate the phase @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , after we use the substitutions of eq .",
    "[ repls ] to account for the fact that the top four - momenta can not be reconstructed completely , no new correlations are needed : both @xmath55 become proportional to @xmath56 and @xmath57 becomes proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "we start from the standard model process @xmath59 implemented in madgraph according to the decay chain feature described in ref .",
    "this decay chain feature is chosen for consistency with the approximations in the analytical calculation of the @xmath1 violating interference term presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the narrow width approximation is used for the intermediate top quark and @xmath22 boson states .",
    "the expressions from ref .",
    "@xcite are then added to the spin and color averaged matrix element squared for the sm ( which madgraph calculates automatically ) and the resulting code is used to generate events .",
    "this code is then missing the terms that are completely due to new physics : those proportional to the anomalous couplings squared .",
    "this approximation is justified because those terms do not generate @xmath0-odd correlations .",
    "in addition , as long as the conditions that allow us to write the new physics in terms of anomalous couplings remain valid , their contribution to the total cross - section is small .",
    "for event generation we use the default madgraph cuts requiring the top quark and @xmath22 boson intermediate states to be within 15 widths of their mass shell , the @xmath60 of both muons to be larger than 10  gev and @xmath61 .",
    "we also use sm parameter values as in madgraph , except for @xmath62 ; and we use the cteq-6l1 parton distribution functions . furthermore , we only include the gluon fusion initiated parton processes .",
    "this procedure leads to a cross - section @xmath63 , which is independent of the anomalous top - quark couplings @xmath64 .",
    "the total cross - section does not depend on @xmath64 because we are only keeping deviations from the sm that are @xmath0 odd .",
    "these terms are also @xmath65 odd , and as such they integrate to zero .",
    "the 4.3  pb cross - section we obtain underestimates the known theoretical cross - section by almost a factor of two .",
    "the latter is derived by multiplying the next - to leading order ( nlo ) total cross - section for @xmath3 production at the lhc with the @xmath66 branching ratios : @xmath67 . about @xmath68 of this difference",
    "arises from the nlo corrections and most of the rest from our decay chain approximation .",
    "we expect the asymmetries we compute to change slightly when the decay chain approximation is relaxed and nlo corrections are included .",
    "numerically we have checked that the asymmetry increases with the cross - section as we relax the decay chain approximation .",
    "we can not quantify rigorously this increase because our starting ( analytic ) formula was computed in the narrow width approximation . in addition , since the asymmetry is an interference effect between the new physics and the sm amplitude , we expect it will get modified by about @xmath69 by nlo qcd corrections .",
    "we first estimate the counting asymmetries of eq .",
    "[ asym ] by generating @xmath70 events for each of the four cases : @xmath71 ; @xmath72 ; @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "these cases correspond to @xmath1 violation in the production vertex , @xmath1 violation in the decay vertex , strong phases in the decay vertex and the lowest order sm respectively . according to our discussion in appendix  [ a : stat ] , we require that the signals be larger than the @xmath75 level for statistical fluctuations , @xmath76 .",
    "asymmetries found to be at this level or below , are estimated once again by increasing @xmath77 or @xmath78 by factors of ten , to @xmath79 .",
    "if the results scale linearly with @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) , they are treated as true @xmath1-odd asymmetries and entered into table  [ t : basic ] .",
    "otherwise they are treated as zero and examined further in appendix  [ a : stat ] by increasing the number of generated events and/or the size of the coupling .",
    "all the zero entries in table  [ t : basic ] satisfy our a - priori expectations .",
    "all the observables @xmath80 are truly @xmath1 odd , so they do not get contributions from the sm ( @xmath81 ) nor from the final state interactions ( @xmath82 but @xmath83 ) .",
    "the case of @xmath84 as induced by @xmath85 is not clear cut as seen in appendix  [ a : stat ] , but we do not pursue it further since there are larger , more promising , asymmetries to constrain this coupling .       these results appear to show that these asymmetries are not zero but rather very small .",
    "the expected linear scaling with the size of the anomalous coupling is not satisfied perfectly leading us to think that statistical fluctuations are not completely under control in this case . as stated in the main text , however , there are better asymmetries to measure this coupling so we do not pursue the issue further .      * by generating event samples of different sizes ranging from @xmath89 to @xmath90 for different values of @xmath91 and @xmath78 , we have verified that the asymmetries scale linearly with the respective anomalous coupling and that the statistical error scales as the square root of the number of events . * using the form factors corresponding to @xmath1 violation due to a higgs boson we have reproduced the asymmetry in ref .",
    "@xcite . * for the case of @xmath77 and asymmetry @xmath92 we have verified that we are in substantial agreement with the much more detailed analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . * for the case of strong interaction phases induced by qcd corrections we have checked that we are in rough agreement with the estimates in ref .",
