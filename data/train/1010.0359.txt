    "time - discrete dynamical systems on a finite state space play an important role in several different contexts",
    ". examples of such systems include boolean networks , cellular automata , agent - based models , and finite state machines , to name a few .",
    "this modeling paradigm has been used with great success to model natural and engineered systems such as biological networks , social networks , and engineered control systems .",
    "it has the advantage of being intuitive and models can be easily simulated on a computer in most cases .",
    "a disadvantage of discrete models of this type is that few analytical tools beyond simulation are available .",
    "the motivation for this paper is to develop such tools for the analysis of models in biology , but the results are of independent mathematical interest .",
    "some theoretical results have been proven for boolean networks and are reviewed in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors study conjunctive boolean networks , that is , boolean networks for which the future state of each node is computed using the boolean and operator .",
    "it is shown that the dynamics of such networks is controlled strongly by the topology of the network .",
    "the current paper shows that the results in @xcite are valid much more broadly .",
    "we briefly describe the main results in @xcite .",
    "a boolean network @xmath0 on @xmath1 nodes @xmath2 can be viewed as a time discrete dynamical system over the boolean field @xmath3 : @xmath4 where the _ coordinate functions _",
    "@xmath5 are the boolean functions assigned to the nodes of the network .",
    "we can associate two directed graphs to @xmath0 .",
    "the _ dependency graph _ ( or wiring diagram ) @xmath6 of @xmath0 has @xmath1 vertices corresponding to the variables @xmath7 of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a directed edge @xmath8 if the function @xmath9 depends on @xmath10 ( i.e. there is an instance where changing the value of @xmath10 changes the value of @xmath9 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath6 encodes the variable dependencies in @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 is encoded by its _ phase space _ , denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "it is the directed graph with vertex set @xmath12 and a directed edge from @xmath13 to @xmath14 if @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the graph @xmath6 encodes part of the structure of @xmath0 and the graph @xmath11 encodes its dynamics .",
    "the results in @xcite relate these two graphs , deriving information about @xmath11 from @xmath6 , in the case where each @xmath5 is a conjunction of the variables @xmath16 for which there is an edge @xmath17 in @xmath6 .",
    "these networks were called _ conjunctive _ networks in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the graph @xmath11 has the following structure .",
    "its connected components consist of a unique directed cycle , a _ limit cycle _ , with directed  trees \" feeding into the nodes of the cycle , representing the transient states of the network , each of which eventually maps to a periodic point . if the graph @xmath6 is strongly connected , that is , there is a directed path from any vertex to any other vertex , then it is shown in @xcite that there is a precise closed formula for the number of limit cycles of any given length .",
    "this formula depends on a numerical invariant of @xmath6 , its loop number .",
    "if @xmath11 is not strongly connected , then there is a sharp lower bound and an upper bound on the number of limit cycles , in terms of the loop numbers of the strongly connected components of @xmath11 and the antichains in the poset of strongly connected components .",
    "these two bounds agree for the number of fixed points of @xmath0 , so that one corollary is a closed formula for the number of fixed points of a general conjunctive network .",
    "the current paper shows that these results hold in much broader generality , namely for time discrete dynamical systems over any finite set @xmath18 : @xmath19 such that the @xmath5 are constructed from an operator @xmath20 , which has the property that it endows @xmath18 with the structure of a semilattice , that is , @xmath21 is commutative , associative , and idempotent .",
    "we will call such functions @xmath5 _ semilattice functions_. that is , any semilattice @xmath18 gives rise to a dynamical system to which the formulas and bounds for limit cycles hold .",
    "it is shown furthermore that they hold precisely for the class of semilattice networks .",
    "it is important to mention that since semilattice networks are not linear ( see example [ eg : linear ] ) , our results complement those for linear systems in @xcite .",
