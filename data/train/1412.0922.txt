    "in the last 30 years organic electronics have evolved to a point that commercial devices are now a part of our lives in the form of , for example , organic light emitting diodes and lightening applications . nevertheless , there are still many issues that need a fundamental understanding and further development.@xcite pentacene is one of the most studied small molecule organic semiconductors and find use in field effect transistors.@xcite among the many factors that affect the performance of an ofet are the charge transfer at the metal electrode / organic semiconductor interface and the mobility of the charges in organic semiconductor film.@xcite both of these factors are in turn , directly or indirectly , correlated to the structure and morphology of the organic film on the metal electrode to a certain extent .",
    "hence electronic and structural properties of pentacene films on metal surfaces have been investigated intensively both experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite    since gold is the choice of electrode material in many devices , pentacene on au surfaces have attracted particular interest.@xcite by means of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( nexafs)@xcite several groups have reported similar full coverage monolayer structures with pentacene molecules lying flat on the au ( 111 ) surface if not with a small tilt angle ( nexafs results indicate an average tilt angle of 13@xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "these structures which will be referred to as `` b '' and `` c '' are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and have packing density of about 1.1 x 10@xmath4 molecules/@xmath5 .",
    "recently we have performed a helium diffraction study of the pen / au(111)@xcite system and observed a commensurate 6 @xmath0 3 monolayer structure which we had also observed on ag(111 ) surfaces@xcite this monolayer phase which has a slightly lower packing density of 0.8 @xmath0 10@xmath4 molecules/@xmath5 is also shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] and will be referred to as `` a '' . at higher coverages",
    "( starting with 2nd ml ) pen molecules still had their long axis parallel to surface but with a higher tilt angle resulting in multilayers structures similar to b - c face of the bulk pen crystal .",
    ", width=313 ]    recently several density functional theory ( dft ) studies of pen / au(111 ) have been performed focusing mostly on the electronic properties such as work function change of the au surface upon pentacene adsorption.@xcite in these studies either isolated pen molecules or one monolayer films were considered on au(111 ) surface@xcite or on au clusters@xcite , without a systematic search for the best adsorption site / geometry and/or the crystal structure .",
    "instead the electronic calculations were performed by using a chosen pentacene unit cell which were different then the experimentally determined ones described above .",
    "nevertheless the calculated work function changes were in good agreement with the experimental value ( 0.95 ev  @xcite ) regardless of the functionals , methods or the unit cells used when the calculations were made on the au(111 ) surfaces . in the cluster calculations of dahnovsky",
    "et al.@xcite , however , who studied the potential energy surface of pentacene and found a very a smooth landscape , the calculated work function change was much lower than the experimental value .",
    "long range van der waals interactions were considered in three of these studies with different approaches .",
    "morikawa et al.@xcite employed dft - d@xcite and vdw - df@xcitemethods and found that while the former method well reproduces the pen - substrate distance , the latter method well reproduces the binding energies .",
    "dahnovsky et al . on the other hand",
    "employed cam - b3lyp@xcite , wb97 and wb97x@xcite long range correlated functionals and found the latter two functionals to reproduce the experimental binding energies accurately",
    ". finally , ortega et al.@xcite who employed lcao - s2-vdw@xcite formalism for geometry optimization could achieve electronic structure results comparable to the experimental values .",
    "here we have systematically studied structural and electronic properties of pentacene on flat and vicinal au(111 ) surface as a function of coverage by means of van der walls density functional theory ( vdw - df ) calculations .",
    "we first studied isolated molecules to determine the most preferred adsorption site and the potential energy surface .",
    "then we have examined different monolayer structures which were reported in the literature .",
    "finally we have investigated higher coverage films up to four monolayers . by this way we were able to monitor the evolution of the electronic and structural properties of the pen films as a function of film thickness and unit cell structure .",
    "in order to describe the morphology and the electronic structures of pen multilayers on flat and vicinal au(111 ) surfaces , we performed van der waals ( vdw ) density functional theory ( dft ) calculations based on projector augmented waves ( paw)@xcite method available in vasp.@xcite a self - consistent implementation of the vdw - df method of dion _ _ et al.__@xcite was used as a non - local correlation functional which accounts for the dispersion interactions .",
    "the exchange part was treated with optb86b functional which is optimized for the correlation part . for the prediction of material properties",
    ", the optb86b - vdw approach has been recently shown to improve over standard and revised exchange - correlation ( xc ) schemes like pbe , revpbe and pbesol.@xcite    four layer slab models were constructed from the bulk phase of gold to represent the flat and vicinal au(111 ) surfaces .",
    "the ionic positions were optimized by minimizing the hellmann - feynman forces until a threshold value of 0.01 ev /  was reached on each atom .",
    "after a full relaxation of the slab geometries , the displacement of the atoms from their bulk positions remained to be less than @xmath6  . therefore the slab thickness is found to be sufficient to represent au(111 ) surface properties .",
    "then , in order to speed up the calculations we only kept the au atoms at the bottom layer of the slabs frozen to their bulk positions .",
    "isolated pen molecules were considered on the 5@xmath08 flat slab to accommodate sufficiently large separation between their periodic images .",
    "all possible adsorption configurations were taken into account as shown in fig .",
    "single and multi layer pen coverages were modeled on the flat au(111)-3@xmath06 supercell .",
    "we considered different pen monolayer phases as seen in fig.[fig1 ] several probable adsorption configurations were built for the pen mono- and multilayers similar to the isolated case .",
    "for the vicinal au(111 ) surface , an au(455 ) supercell was built with a terrace size of @xmath719.8  along [ @xmath811 ] .",
    "a vacuum space with a height of least 13  was introduced to prevent any unphysical interaction between the periodic images of the slabs .",
    "all calculations were performed both at the standard dft level with pbe xc functional and at the vdw - df level with optb86b - vdw approach .",
    "the interactons between the ionic cores and the valence electrons have been treated within the paw method using plane waves up to a cutoff energy of 370 ev .",

    "the density of states ( dos ) calculations have been carried out with doubly denser @xmath9-point meshes .",
    "these parameters were tested and optimized to get well converged total energies of the physical structures considered in this work .",
    "we estimated the binding energies of pen molecules on au(111 ) surface by , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the total energies of the pn / au(111 ) combined system , of the bare au(111 ) slab and of a single pn in a big box , respectively .",

    "crystal structure having a space group symmetry of fm@xmath14 m ( 225 ) with a bulk lattice constant of 4.078 .@xcite standard pbe overestimates it leading to a value of 4.160  due to the inherent tendency of the lda to distribute charge uniformly which is not the case especially in metals .",
    "the vdw - df method better predicts the lattice constant to be 4.125  through the formulation of the long ranged dispersive effects the correlation part and the optimization of exchange energy , so called the optb86b functional .",

    "have been considered to optimize a full pen monolayer coverage on the vicinal surface using both the standard and vdw corrected dft .",
    "these involve tilted , flat and flat2 cases .",
    "the tilted case corresponds to the model where all molecules are tilted with respect to the surface normal about their major axes . in the flat one",
    ", every pen lays parallel over the surface as that on the planar au(111 ) case .",
    "the flat2 model was constructed such that the molecules lie planar on the terrace and tilted at the step edge .    , width=317 ]    the minimum energy geometry of a full pen monolayer on the vicinal au surface with the standard dft ( pbe ) turns out to be the tilted configuration as shown in figure  [ fig7]a .",
    "the tilting angle is about 22.8@xmath3 .",
    "apparently , this result is different from the case of 1 ml on the flat au(111 ) surface .",
    "although the binding energy of a tilted pen at the step edge is underestimated by pbe , the molecules on the terrace follow this tilting since intermolecular coupling is relatively stronger than the metal - molecule interaction at this level of theory .",
    "however , the vdw - df calculations ( optb86b - vdw ) favor the flat2 case ( figure  [ fig7]b ) as a result of the inclusion of the dispersive forces self - consistently .",
    "this improves the description of organic molecule - metal surface interaction .",
    "for instance , when started from the tilted model as the initial geometry , the vdw calculations ends up with the flat2 configuration .",
    "moreover , as presented in table  [ table4 ] , the height of the adlayer from the terrace gets slightly larger than the separation of a single isolated molecule from the surface , mimicking the role of molecular orbital overlap .",
    "the pbe xc functional follows the same trend and optimizes 2 ml pen into tilted - tilted configuration ( figure  [ fig7]c ) .",
    "the interaction between the pen films and the gold surface estimated by the standard dft is weaker than what is experimentally observed .",
    "this shortcoming of lda parametrization of long range correlations is also implied by the calculated layer heights from the surface being unreasonably large .",
    "for instance , for the 1 ml case , pbe results in a pen layer which stays 3.92  above the surface in the tilted geometry . this distance is predicted to be 3.18  in the flat2 model relaxed using the optb86b - vdw approach .",
    "moreover , at the pbe level , the presence of the step does not seem to cause significant disorder in the formation of thin pentacene films on gold . on the contrary ,",
    "tilted pentacene at the step edge acts as a mediator of molecular tilting throughout the first and the second adlayers . indeed , when we start with the flat2-tilted initial configuration , the geometry optimization with pbe xc functional resulted in the tilted - tilted model structure as indicated in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the vdw - df theory of the van der waals interactions leads to a relatively less ordered flat2-tilted formation ( figure  [ fig7]d ) .",
    "furthermore , optb86b - vdw relaxes the tilted - tilted configuration , which is favored by pbe , to flat2-tilted model as the minimum energy structure .",
    "when one compares the 2 ml pen adsorption results on the flat au(111 ) and on the vicinal au(455 ) surface , the effect of the step becomes vital in the formation of thin film formation . especially , vdw corrected dft indicates disorder to a certain extent in the vicinity of the step edge .",
    "electronically , we computed the dos structures of the thin pen films up to 2 ml coverage using the optb86b - vdw approach .",
    "the densities of states of the bare and a single pen adsorbed au(455 ) surfaces are depicted in the bottom two panels of figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "an isolated pen at the step exhibits significant electronic contribution at and around the fermi energy as a result of the formation of four strong bonds with the au atoms at the edge .",
    "the homo level of tilted pen at the step is identified as @xmath17 ev while its lumo lies 0.35 ev above the fermi energy .",
    "core molecular orbitals strongly resonate with the deeper lying gold states .",
    "the positions of the homo and the lumo levels of pen with respect to the fermi energy in the vicinal au(455 ) surface case ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) are significantly red shifted relative to those in the flat au(111 ) surface case ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this level shift is approximately 0.4 ev .",
    "moreover , pen shows a larger dispersion of molecular orbitals over au(455 ) states .",
    "these results indicate an enhanced charge carrier transport at the pen - gold interface in favor of the vicinal surface .",
    "we have performed density functional theory calculation of pentacene films with and without dispersion corrections and investigated the evolution of crystal and electronic structure of the films as a function of coverage and surface steps . to study the effects of dispersion interactions",
    "we have used a self - consistent implementation of the vdw - df method of dion _ et al . _ as implemented in vasp and compared the results with those obtained by the standard pbe functional .",
    "while for isolated molecules both methods yield the same adsorption site as the most preferred one for a lying down molecule , the binding strength was observed to be higher with dispersion correction as expected .",
    "the energy difference between the different binding sites were very small resulting in a smooth potential energy surface for an isolated pentacene on au(111 ) .",
    "three different experimentally observed unit cell structures were investigated and ( 6x3 ) was found to be the most stable one , though the binding energies for all three were very close to each other , the difference being less than 8 kj / mol .",
    "these results in fact explain why pentacene has so many monolayer phases / structures forming simultaneously on the au(111 ) surface .",
    "while dispersion corrected results favor a flat lying first layer for all the coverages on the ( 111 ) surface , the pbe results indicate a tilting of the molecules about their long axis which is not more than 10 degrees .",
    "these results are also in agreement with the experimental findings regarding pentacene monolayer films on au(111 ) which report the molecules to be either flat or to have a very small tilt angle . in case of the vicinal ( 455 ) surface ,",
    "an isolated pentacene molecule was found to be strongly bound to the step edge which also causes significant contribution to the density of states at and around the fermi energy .",
    "dispersion corrected projected dos calculations indicate that for the multilayer films pentacene states are significantly shifted and dispersed on the ( 455 ) surface when compared with the ( 111 ) surface , which can result in an enhanced charge transfer at the pen - gold interface . in summary ,",
    "our results underline the importance of the dispersion corrections for the loosely bound systems like pentacene on gold and the role played by step edges in determining the multilayer film structure and charge transfer at the organic molecule - metal interface .",
