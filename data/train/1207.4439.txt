    "the phenomena of integer and fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effects have motivated remarkable developments . of particular significance in this context",
    "is the topological interpretation of these effects .",
    "thouless , kohmoto , nightingale and den nijs @xcite considered electrons in a periodic lattice exposed to a magnetic field , and showed that the hall conductance of a filled band is related to the first chern number @xmath0 . specifically , the bloch wave function for a magnetic unit cell has the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the wave vector in the first brillouin zone , and @xmath3 is the band index .",
    "one defines the non - abelian berry connection as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the shorthand notation for @xmath6 .",
    "the berry curvature @xmath7 is then defined as @xmath8\\ ] ] thouless _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the hall conductance is given , in units of @xmath9 , by the berry curvature integrated over the brillouin zone : @xmath10 = c\\ ] ] where the trace is over the occupied bands .",
    "the chern number is a topological index provided the sum is over filled bands and the fermi level lies in a gap .",
    "if there is only one occupied band , as we will assume below in this paper , the above expressions simplify to @xmath11 ref .",
    "[ ] thus gave a topological interpretation of the quantized hall conductance and also clarified that the essential property of a landau level that distinguishes it from an ordinary band is its nonzero chern number .",
    "subsequently , haldane @xcite showed that a uniform magnetic field is not required to produce bands with nonzero chern numbers .",
    "for this purpose he constructed an explicit model of an electron hopping on the honeycomb ( graphene ) lattice , with complex hopping matrix elements ; this model has no _ net _ magnetic field ( although it has staggered magnetic field ) but produces bands with nonzero chern numbers in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "this system has integrally quantized hall conductance in the absence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "systems with bands of nontrivial topology ( nonzero chern number ) in the absence of a uniform magnetic field are now called  chern insulators , \" to distinguish them from the landau levels that occur in the presence of a uniform magnetic field . a number of other models have been proposed for chern insulators , some of which have nearly flat bands @xcite .",
    "the next natural question is whether chern bands can also support fqh - like states ; that is incompressible states in a partially filled chern band with a fractionally quantized hall conductance .",
    "such states will obviously require interactions , and have been dubbed fractional chern insulator ( fci ) states .",
    "exact numerical diagonalizations have demonstrated fci states at filling factors @xmath12 ,  @xcite @xmath13 ,  @xcite @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite for fermions , and @xmath13 ,  @xcite @xmath16 ,  @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite for bosons .",
    "these states require specific forms of interaction , and sometimes fine tuning of parameters .",
    "trial wave functions for fcis have been proposed @xcite .",
    "flat - band models with @xmath18 have also been constructed and produce strongly - interacting topological states @xcite .",
    "while the fci states appear similar to the fqh states found in the lowest landau level , no direct connection between them has yet been established .",
    "it remains unclear why some fractions occur while others do not , and what is the role of lattice symmetry and the type and range of the interaction in establishing various fci states .",
    "it also remains unclear to what extent the extensive physics of the fqh effect and composite fermions is possible in chern insulators .",
    "progress in this direction has been made by murthy and shankar @xcite , who exploit the modified algebra of the density operator projected into the lowest chern band to motivate composite fermion physics .",
    "we address below this issue by demonstrating an adiabatic continuity between the ordinary quantum hall states in a landau level and the corresponding states in a chern insulator .",
    "because the latter are defined on a lattice , we work with a lattice model of electrons in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "this problem of bloch electrons in a magnetic field was studied in a number of papers , including those by peierls ,  @xcite harper ,  @xcite wannier ,  @xcite , azbel ,  @xcite , and hofstadter ,  @xcite , with the last article presenting the band structure in a pictorially appealing form that is now known as the hofstadter butterfly . for",
    "appropriately chosen flux per plaquette , the low - lying bloch bands of this system are essentially landau levels ; they approximate landau levels of the continuum very accurately for a sufficiently fine lattice .",
    "we call them  hofstadter bands , \" and the filled band states",
    " hofstadter insulators . \" for a given hofstadter lattice , not all fqh states of the continuum will occur , and which ones survive is an interesting problem in its own right , but will not be addressed in this article ( some work along these lines can be found in the literature @xcite ) . however",
    ", we can certainly construct a hofstadter lattice that approximates the continuum arbitrarily closely , by taking the flux per plaquette to be sufficiently small , and thus it produces all of the quantum hall states seen in continuum .",
    "( strictly speaking , the electrons in gaas quantum wells are not in a continuum but feel the periodic potential of the lattice . )",
    "we will study a possible adiabatic connection between the quantum hall states on a hofstadter lattice and the corresponding states in a chern insulator .",
    "an intuitive understanding for why an adiabatic connection between a chern and a hofstadter lattice may exist can be gained by noting that a hofstadter insulator in a _ uniform _ magnetic field can be transformed into a chern insulator in zero _ net _ magnetic field by a simple gauge transformation . for a hofstadter lattice ,",
    "the total magnetic field passing through each magnetic unit cell is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is an integer ) . here and below , one flux quantum is defined as @xmath21 in units with @xmath22 .",
    "let us now insert a @xmath23 flux at an arbitrary point in each magnetic unit cell to produce a new problem , called hofstadter@xmath24 (  hofstadter prime \" ) .",
    "the insertion of the @xmath23 flux in a tight - binding model , however , is simply a gauge choice that has no physical consequence , and hence leaves all properties of the system unchanged : the energy bands of the hofstadter lattice are identical to those of the original hofstadter lattice , and the eigenfunctions of the two are related by a gauge transformation . in particular , the bands of the new lattice continue to have nonzero chern numbers . at the same time , if we treat the ( enlarged ) magnetic unit cell as our unit cell , then the total magnetic field through it is zero .",
    "the hofstadter lattice is thus a chern insulator .",
    "( in fact , this chern insulator has flat bands and uniform berry curvature . )",
    "every hofstadter insulator thus has a corresponding chern insulator with identical properties .",
    "this implies that all of the physics of fqh effect and composite fermions is , in principle , possible for chern insulators , provided that we allow chern insulators with a sufficiently complex unit cell .    for simple chern lattices ,",
    "not all fqh states occur . in what follows",
    ", we consider certain previously introduced chern insulator models , construct for each a hofstadter lattice whose magnetic unit cell coincides with the unit cells of the chern insulator , and show , using exact numerical methods , that the familiar fqh states at filling factors @xmath25 and @xmath13 of the hofstadter model adiabatically evolve into the corresponding fci states in the presence of appropriate repulsive interactions .",
    "( because hofstadter lattice is trivially related to the hofstadter lattice , we will dispense with the prime below . )",
    "we show that not only does the ground state evolve in this manner , but so do the quasiholes and the entanglement spectra , lending further credence to such an adiabatic relationship .",
    "this demonstrates that the origin of these states is governed by the same underlying physics . furthermore",
    ", this adiabatic connection also enables us to investigate the role of the berry curvature distribution in the momentum space .",
    "we find that nonuniformity in the distribution of the berry curvature weakens , and can even destroy , fqh states .",
    "our results show that such nonuniformities effectively translate into an enhancement of the residual interaction between composite fermions , and as a result can eliminate states of the sequence @xmath26 with relatively small gaps ( all these fractions would occur for noninteracting composite fermions ) .",
    "nonetheless , several fqh states are surprisingly robust to nonuniformities of the berry curvature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present two single - particle tight - binding models with topologically nontrivial lowest bands in sec .",
    "the fqh states on these lattice models , with appropriately chosen interactions , are studied in sec .",
    "iv concludes with a discussion of the implications of our results .",
    "since the posting of the first version of this work as arxiv:1207.4439v1 , some new results  @xcite have appeared , which are also discussed in sec .",
    "we consider two popular models for chern insulators : the checkerboard and the kagome lattices . in either case ,",
    "our goal is to write a more general model that extrapolates between a hofstadter lattice and a chern insulator lattice . for this purpose",
    "we add many more lattice sites to the chern insulator lattice to create a hofstadter lattice , and arrange the flux per plaquette so that the hofstadter lattice has the same magnetic unit cell as the chern insulator being considered , and also has a net zero magnetic field passing through the magnetic unit cell . with this arrangement both",
    "the lattices have the same symmetries ( although they have different numbers of bands , because they have different numbers of lattice sites in a unit cell ) and it is sensible to envision an adiabatic evolution from one to the other .",
    "we first study the single - particle band structures to demonstrate an adiabatic connection between a landau level and a chern band for the two lattice models mentioned above .    , and the star marks the plaquette where a @xmath27 flux is inserted.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      the checkerboard lattice model was considered in refs .   and  .",
    "it supports a topologically nontrivial band in the presence of nearest - neighbor , next - nearest - neighbor , and next - next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms , with the nearest neighbor hopping carrying a nonzero phase . by appropriate choice of parameters",
    ", the lowest band can be made very nearly flat , which is an important consideration for the discussion of the fci states , which require that the interaction energy dominate the kinetic energy .",
    "the checkerboard lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ latticebandchecker](a ) by the encircled dots , with its two sublattices marked by blue and red rectangles .",
    "the checkerboard hamiltonian @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the phase acquired during hopping between nearest neighbors @xmath31 , the @xmath32 is positive ( negative ) for next - nearest - neighbor hoppings between sites encircled by blue ( red ) rectangles , and @xmath33 denotes next - next - nearest neighbors .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ latticebandchecker](a ) , we embed the checkerboard lattice inside a square hofstadter lattice ( all black dots ) with only nearest neighbor hopping . it is assumed that each square of this lattice has a magnetic flux @xmath34 passing through it ( @xmath35 for fig .

[ squarelatticephase ] ) which has an additional @xmath36 flux passing through it in the opposite direction ( so the net flux is @xmath37 through this plaquette ) , so as to make the total flux through the magnetic unit cell equal to zero .",
    "( in other words , the lattice is what we had called hofstadter@xmath24 . )",
    "the hopping matrix elements are complex , with our choice of phases shown in fig .",
    "[ squarelatticephase ] .",
    "the phases are chosen to obey periodic boundary conditions , but that does not fix them uniquely ; we further impose the convention that the phase coming up to a site is the same as the phase going out of it toward right , as shown in the figure .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the phases correspond to a flux of @xmath38 through each square , except for the starred one which has an additional flux of @xmath27 through it .",
    "the hamiltonian of this hofstadter model on square lattice is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "we note that we could have taken a finer lattice with a larger number ( @xmath3 ) of squares per unit cell ; landau levels are recovered in the weak lattice limit of @xmath40 . for our purposes",
    "the current choice with 16 squares in a magnetic unit cell will suffice , as seen below in the explicit numerical calculations .",
    "it is also noteworthy that if we only had the hofstadter lattice ( no checkerboard lattice ) , then we could have chosen a linear magnetic unit cell with 16 sites along a single line ; this magnetic unit cell arises naturally in the landau gauge , and was the choice made by hofstadter .",
    "however , our objective of matching the hofstadter problem to the checkerboard problem forces us to choose identical unit cells for both of them .",
    "we are not able to explicitly write a real space gauge potential that would produce the desired phases for the hopping matrix elements , but an appropriate gauge choice is made directly at the level of the phases of the hopping matrix elements .",
    "having defined the checkerboard and the hofstadter hamiltonians separately , we now define an interpolating hamiltonian @xmath41 which evolves continuously from hofstadter to checkerboard as @xmath42 increases from @xmath43 to @xmath16 .",
    "this interpolation scheme selects one specific path in the parameter space connecting the hofstadter and the checkerboard hamiltonians .",
    "we shall see that this path will suffice for demonstrating adiabatic continuity for many situations . by fourier transformation ,",
    "the above hamiltonian can be converted into its momentum - space form @xmath44 and the nonzero components of @xmath45 are given in the appendix , where @xmath46 .",
    "diagonalization of this 16 @xmath47 16 hamiltonian produces the eigenstates and eigenvalues for the 16 bands as a function of the two - dimensional wave vector @xmath2 over the entire brillouin zone .",

    "[ latticebandchecker ] ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) show the band structure at these @xmath42 values .",

    "a peak of @xmath167 emerges at the @xmath171 point while its value near the @xmath168 point goes to zero .",
    "although the integrated berry curvature in the whole brillouin zone remains constant ( @xmath36 times the chern number ) , its fluctuations become nearly as large as its mean value as @xmath42 approaches unity .",
    "this change in the distribution of the berry curvature has a direct correlation with the many body properties . as a quantitative measure of the deviation of the berry curvature from its average value @xmath98 , we define the standard deviation of berry curvature as @xmath172 with @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the area of the brillouin zone .",
    "we now argue that this quantity determines the robustness of the fqh states .",

    "[ gapberryratio ] that the spectral gaps for the ground and quasihole states at different fillings follow the same trend , changing rapidly for @xmath175 and then saturating at @xmath176 .",
    "these many - body gaps have a strong ( anti)correlation with @xmath177 , indicating its important role in the fci states .",
    "while the topological properties remain intact over a wide range of @xmath97 , an increase in @xmath97 reduces the size of the gap and thus the robustness of the fci states .",
    "essentially , the variations in @xmath178 enhance the residual interactions between composite fermions , as we see from the increase in the bandwidths of the quasihole and quasiparticle states , which causes a weakening of the fci states .",

    "this is physically understandable .",
    "the moore - read pfaffian state is the exact zero - energy state of a short - range three - body interaction in the lowest landau level , but adding longer - range components weakens , and even eliminates , this state  @xcite .",
    "a smaller exponent in @xmath133 means a longer - range interaction in the hofstadter limit , which renders the @xmath13 fqh states weaker .",
    "the equivalence of the fqh and fci states has been studied from the perspective of density algebra ,  @xcite based on the observation that the commutators of momentum - space density operators have the same form in the long - wavelength ( small - momentum ) limit and for flat berry curvature .",

    "the hofstadter models that we construct have nearly flat berry curvature and thus the folding rule is almost exact .",
