    "the coalescence model is based on the simple assumption that ( hyper)nuclei are formed if ( anti-)nucleons and/or ( anti-)hyperons are close in the coordinate as well as in the momentum phase space . in the thermal model , the abundance of particles is determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions . since the baryo - chemical potential ( ) is close to zero at lhc energies , the thermal model predicts the dependence of the particle yields on the chemical freeze - out temperature ( @xmath2 ) by the relation d@xmath3/d@xmath4  @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
