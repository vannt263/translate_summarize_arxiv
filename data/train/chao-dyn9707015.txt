    "the aim of this paper is to present a general scheme for the calculation of the scaling exponents characterizing the statistical quantities that arise in the description of fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "these statistical quantities are various averages computed from the fundamental field in hydrodynamics , the velocity field of the fluid .",
    "denote the eulerian velocity field as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a point in @xmath4-dimensional space ( usually @xmath5 or 3 ) and @xmath6 is the time .",
    "statistical quantities that have attracted years of experimental and theoretical attention @xcite are the structure functions of velocity differences , denoted as @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for a suitably defined ensemble average .",
    "it has been asserted for a long time that the structure functions scale as a function of the separation @xmath10 according to @xmath11 where @xmath0 are known as the scaling exponents of the structure functions .",
    "it is assumed here that the separation @xmath10 lies in the so - called  inertial range \" , i.e. @xmath12 with @xmath13 the inner viscous scale and @xmath14 the outer integral scale of turbulence .",
    "one of the major questions in fundamental turbulence research is whether these scaling exponents are correctly predicted by the classical kolmogorov 41 theory in which @xmath15 , or if these exponents manifest the phenomenon of  multiscaling \" with @xmath0 a nonlinear function of @xmath1 , as has been indicated by physical and numerical experiments @xcite .    in an attempt to develop a consistent theory of turbulence",
    "one may define statistical quantities that depend on many spatial and temporal coordinates . defining the velocity difference @xmath16 as @xmath17 one considers the @xmath1-rank tensor space - time correlation function @xmath18 the simultaneous correlation function @xmath19",
    "is obtained from @xmath20 when @xmath21 . in statistically stationary turbulence",
    "the equal time correlation function is time independent , and we denote it as @xmath22 one expects that when all the separations @xmath23 are in the inertial range , @xmath24 , the simultaneous correlation function is scale invariant in the sense that @xmath25 and the exponent @xmath0 is numerically the same as the one appearing in eq .",
    "( [ scalelaw ] ) .",
    "one of the major difference between the study of statistical turbulence and other examples of anomalous scaling in physics ( like critical phenomena ) is that there is no theory for the simultaneous correlation functions ( [ deff ] ) that does not involve the many time correlation functions ( [ defft ] ) . _ turbulence is a truly dynamical problem _ , and there is no free energy functional or a boltzmann factor to provide a time - independent theory of the statistical weights .",
    "the theory for the simultaneous quantities ( [ deff ] ) involves _ integrals over the time variables of the many time quantities _ ( [ defft ] ) .",
    "one must therefore learn how to perform these time integrations properly .",
    "we propose here a point of departure from all previous attempts to compute the anomalous exponents @xmath0 from first principles , based on the understanding that these functions are not scale invariant in their time arguments ; this allows us to build a new approach .",
    "naively one could assume that the scale invariance property extends to the time correlation functions in the sense that @xmath26 with a dynamical scaling exponent @xmath27 which can be @xmath1 dependent .",
    "we have shown @xcite that this is not the case , and in this paper we explain that using an adequate representation of the time dependence _ leads to a calculation scheme for the scaling exponents_. we will reiterate that even in fully resummed theories , if we assume scale invariance in time we lose the availability of anomalous scaling in favor of k41 scaling .",
    "full respect to the dynamical nature of the problem is required in order to proceed in understanding anomalous scaling .",
    "our strategy in developing a scheme of computation of the scaling exponents can be described as follows : the first step is to transform the navier - stokes equations using the belinicher - lvov transformation @xcite , see eqs.([a2])-([newbl ] ) .",
    "the resulting velocity field is denoted @xmath28 , and the correlation function over these velocity fields is denoted @xmath29 , see eq .",
    "( [ defftime ] ) .",
    "next we construct the infinite hierarchy of equations that relate the rate of change of the @xmath1th order correlation function @xmath29 to a space integral over a vertex convolved with the ( @xmath30)th order correlation function @xmath31 .",
    "this hierarchy is given by eqs.([balt]),([baltver ] ) below and it is exact .",
    "next we explain , using the fusion rules @xcite that govern the asymptotic properties of the correlations functions when groups of their spatial arguments coalesce together , that the spatial integrals converge both in the uv and the ir limits .",
    "this result allows us to show that if eq .",
    "( [ tscaleinv ] ) were true , the hierarchy of equations could be studied by power counting , and the only solution would be linear ( i.e. @xmath0 linear in @xmath1 ) rather than anomalous scaling",
    ". we will show that eq .",
    "( [ tscaleinv ] ) is not true , and that the many - time correlation functions must be  multiscaling \" in their time representation .",
    "this fact means that the hierarchy of equations can not be studied by power counting .",
    "the next step is to represent the space and time dependent correlation functions in a way that exposes their multiscaling characteristics @xcite .",
    "this form ( [ repres ] ) is a convenient form that makes use of the  multifractal \" representation , which was found useful before in the context of the simultaneous objects @xcite",
    ". this representation amounts to saddle point integrals over correlation functions that respect the exact symmetry of the euler equation , i.e. the symmetry of rescaling according to @xmath32 using this representation we will see that the hierarchy of equations for the correlation functions is satisfied in the sense of power counting for any value of @xmath33 , cf .",
    "( [ greater ] ) .",
    "the information about the scaling exponents is hidden in the coefficients of the equation but can not be read from power counting .",
    "we are still faced with an infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "this is not accidental ; the calculation of infinitely many anomalous exponents in turbulence does indeed necessitate a calculation of infinitely many renormalized objects .",
    "nevertheless we want to achieve a finite , approximate calculation of lower order exponents ( i.e @xmath0 with for the first integer values @xmath1 ) .",
    "to this aim we need to truncate the infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "the way to achieve an intelligent truncation can be seen from the study of renormalized perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "perturbative theories of turbulence have fallen into some ill - repute since the problem of turbulence does not have any small parameter that guarantees convergence of perturbative expansions . to increase our confidence in this approach , we first prove that the content of fully resummed perturbation theory is identical to the exact hierarchy of equations for @xmath1-order correlation functions and green s functions .",
    "this important result , which is demonstrated here for the first time , allows us to proceed safely in using partially resummed perturbation theory to guide our truncation of the hierarchy of exact equations .",
    "the clue is that we want to preserve the invariance of the theory under the rescaling ( [ ressym ] ) .",
    "we outline how to do this in section 8 and appendix a of this paper .",
    "the actual analysis of the method of truncating while preserving the symmetry , and an approximate calculation of the low order exponents will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite . here",
    "we present the conceptual steps and technical issues .",
    "in order to derive anomalous exponents it is essential to develop a theory that is nonperturbative . in addition",
    ", one needs to deal with the effect of the sweeping of small scales by large scale motions .",
    "this effect is only kinematic , but it can mask the inherent time scales associated with nonlinear interactions , and therefore has to be carefully taken into account . to this aim",
    "we start this section with a short review of the equations of motion in the belinicher - lvov representation ( subsection a ) , followed by the introduction of the statistical quantities of interest , which are @xmath1-order space time correlation functions and green s functions in subsection b. in subsection c we derive the exact hierarchy of equations satisfied by these quantities , the main results being eqs .",
    "( [ balt ] ) ( [ baltver ] ) and ( [ balgn ] ) .      the analytic theory of turbulence is based on the navier - stokes equation for the eulerian velocity field @xmath2 . in the case of an incompressible fluid they read @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath36 is the pressure , and @xmath37 is some forcing which maintains the flow",
    ". since we are interested in incompressible flows , we project the longitudinal components out of the equations of motion .",

    "applying @xmath40 to eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) we find @xmath41 this equation has been used as a starting point for a field - theoretic perturbation theory , in which the nonlinear term acts as a  perturbation \" on the linear part of the equation .",
    "such an approach is fraught with difficulties simply because the natural statistical objects which appear in the perturbation expansions@xcite of the navier - stokes equation are correlation functions @xmath42 of the velocity field @xmath2 itself : @xmath43 the problem is that the correlator @xmath44 is not universal , since it is dominated by contributions to @xmath45 which come from the largest scales in the fluid flow , and these are determined by the features of the energy injection mechanisms .",
    "this physical fact is reflected in the theory as infra - red divergences that have plagued the development of analytic approach for decades . indeed , all the early attempts to develop a consistent analytic approach to turbulence , notably the well known theories of wyld@xcite and of martin , siggia and rose@xcite , shared this problem .",
    "one needs to transform eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) such that the statistical objects that appear naturally will be written in terms of velocity differences which can be universal .",
    "we like to use the belinicher - lvov ( bl ) transformation for this purpose , but any other transformation that reaches the same goal is equally acceptable .",
    "we will stress that the results that we obtain below do not depend on the details of the transformation , and we employ the bl transformation because it is particularly straightforward .",
    "the equation of motion that is obtained from the bl - transformation is exact , and there is no approximation involved in this step . in terms of the eulerian velocity @xmath2 belinicher and lvov defined the field",

    "the field @xmath52 is simply the eulerian field in the frame of reference of a single chosen material point @xmath53 .",
    "the observation of belinicher and lvov @xcite was that the variables @xmath54 defined as @xmath55 exactly satisfy a navier - stokes - like equation in the incompressible limit .",
    "consequently one can develop a diagrammatic perturbation theory in terms of these variables @xcite .",
    "the resulting theory is free of the two related problems that we discussed above : the @xmath56 correlators are universal for @xmath57 in the inertial range , and the theory is free of infra - red ( and ultra - violet ) divergences resulting from sweeping .",
    "it can be also shown @xcite that kolmogorov 1941 scaling is an order by order solution of the resulting theory .",
    "this formulation has two important properties .",
    "( i ) the simultaneous correlators of @xmath58 are @xmath59-independent and identical to the simultaneous correlators of @xmath60 .",
    "the reason is that for stationary statistics the simultaneous correlators of an arbitrary number of factors of @xmath61 does not depend on @xmath6 , and in particular one can take @xmath51 .",

    "this will serve as a guidance for the new ideas that pave the route that is taken in the rest of this paper .",
    "the first serious attempt to derive the scaling exponents of the statistical objects was due to kraichnan @xcite , who introduced the  direct - interaction approximation \" ( dia ) . in the context of our presentation",
    "this approximation means truncating the set of exact equations by replacing the dressed vertex a by its bare counterpart , and by equating the dressed vertices b and c to their bare value which is zero .",
    "this approximation leads to closed equations in terms of the second order correlation functions and green s function .",
    "kraichnan was the first to understand that after an appropriate transformation of the velocity field ( he chose lagrangian , but belinicher and lvov showed that their transformation amounted to the same result ) the space integrals in the dia converge at both ends . as a result of this  locality \" of the integrals , neither an inner nor an outer scale appears in the bulk of the inertial interval . in addition , kraichnan assumed that the space - time correlation functions are scale invariant in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ tscaleinv ] ) .",
    "this assumption , together with the property of locality , lead to the existence of scaling relations connecting the exponents @xmath233 and @xmath177 : @xmath234 of course , the solution is k41 , i.e. @xmath235 .",
    "it should be understood at this point that this disappointing result will continue to hold not just at the dia level , but at any finite order in the dressing of the vertex via the perturbative scheme . since it was shown that _ every _ diagram exhibits locality , the scaling relations are reproduced by any finite truncation of the line resummed perturbation theory .",
    "whenever we have a set of linear scaling relations , k41 can be the only solution .",
    "it is always a solution by dimensional reasoning , and therefore it must solve any set of scaling relations .",
    "the linearity of the scaling relations is then the end of the story .",
    "one way out would be to assert that a full dressing of the vertex may result in a new scaling exponent for that object .",
    "we still have a linear set of two scaling relations , but now three exponents to determine .",
    "the extra freedom allows deviations from k41 .",
    "however , this is _ not the case _ as long as we believe that the scale invariance as assumed in the form eq .",
    "( [ tscaleinv ] ) indeed holds .",
    "it was shown by lvov and lebedev @xcite that under that assumption the exponent of the vertex is unchanged from its bare value of @xmath236 .",
    "accordingly , k41 seems a deeper trap than ever .",
    "is there a way out ?",
    "our contention is that the fundamental fallacy is the assumption eq .",
    "( [ tscaleinv ] ) .",
    "one could think that there is a fundamental problem with renormalized perturbation theory since the problem lacks a small parameter . to show that this is not the case we develop the theory further , and",

    "we will then argue that _ finite _ resummations of the perturbation theory up to a given order will give successive approximations which are useful for the solution of the fundamental equations ( [ greater ] ) .",
    "the student of fluid mechanics who is not familiar with field theoretic methods may find the diagrammatic expansion discussed in section 5 somewhat foreboding .",
    "the student of field theories , on the other hand , may find them suspicious since the problem does not have a small parameter .",
    "it is important therefore for general understanding , and also crucial for the further development of our theory , to show that the fully resummed equations discussed above are equivalent to hierarchies of equations that can be derived exactly from the navier - stokes equations .",

    "when it is attached to one of the dressed vertices a , b or c one needs to use their exact representation as shown in figs.[f6]c . in all the other contributions we can leave the dressed vertices a , b and c unchanged . at this point",
    "we can collect all the terms , and find 60 terms ( counting each one with a factor 1/2 once and with a factor 1 twice ) .",
    "one may then substitute the exact representation for the dark 4th order vertices as a sum of four contributions , like those shown in fig .",
    "[ f13]b in appendix a. this will reduce the number of contributions to 15 , all with dark 4th order vertices .",
    "this is precisely the right number of contributions needed to reproduce the exact result which is the empty circle vertex @xmath107 integrated against the 15 contributions in @xmath230 shown in fig .",
    "this completes the derivation of the second equation in the hierarchy shown in fig .",
    "exactly the same procedure ( but with fewer terms ) provides the derivation of the second equation in the hierarchy of the green s function @xmath117 shown in fig .  [ f3 ] etc .",
    "this derivation can be repeated at any order , showing the exact correspondence of the fully resummed diagrammatics and the hierarchic equations . since the proof calls for the introduction of additional graphical notations we present it in the appendix for the consideration of the dedicated reader .",

    "if we replace at this point the triple vertex by its bare value we will generate the direct interaction approximation . in the next step of resummation",
    "we have 2nd and 3rd order objects in fully resummed form .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that by deferring the closure approximation to higher and higher order steps of the resummation we may find better and better answers for the lower order objects . in the next section we will discuss several possibilities of making intelligent closures .",

    "consider then the three point vertices a , b and c. we have for each of these vertices an infinite series in terms of themselves and the lower order 2-point correlation functions and green s functions , see figs.[f6]b .",
    "of course , taking all the infinite contributions is impossible , and we need a criterion to choose partial series of contributions as the approximation for the 3rd - order vertices .",
    "one traditional approximation that one could use is the so - called ",
    "triangular approximation \" @xcite ; this means that we take all the triangular diagrams like the first four contributions after the bare vertex in fig .",

    "in fact such an approximation is not suitable for our needs . in the forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "we will show that this approximation reintroduces power counting to the hierarchy ( [ greater ] ) .",
    "on the other hand we will show that the approximation that is obtained by taking _ only the skeleton contributions _ and _ neglecting the fully irreducible contributions _ is appropriate , since it does not reintroduce power counting . in other words",

    "as shown above , the skeleton contributions to the 4th order vertices consist of two triple vertices and those for the 5th order vertices have contributions of two types .",
    "those with full triple vertices connected by two propagator bridges and one full triple vertex with one irreducible 4th order vertex connected by one propagator bridge .",
    "we do not present here the skeleton contributions to 6th order vertices .",
    "there are four types of them : 1 ) four black triangles on a line , connected via three propagator bridges , 2 ) four black triangles in a star configuration with one central triangle connected via three bridges with three other triangles , 3 ) two irreducible 4th order vertices ( empty squares ) connected by a propagator , and 4 ) a triple vertex ( black triangle ) connected via a propagator to a 5th order irreducible vertex .",
    "some of the confusing aspects of the analysis described above , and in particular the developments leading to eq .",
    "( [ greater ] ) became much clearer due to discussions with victor belinicher to whom we offer thanks .",

    "<S> we propose a scheme for the calculation from the navier - stokes equations of the scaling exponents @xmath0 of the @xmath1th order correlation functions in fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is nonperturbative and constructed to respect the fundamental rescaling symmetry of the euler equation . </S>",
    "<S> it constitutes an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations that are obeyed identically with respect to scaling for any set of scaling exponents @xmath0 . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the scaling exponents are determined by solvability conditions and not from power counting . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that in order to achieve such a formulation one must recognize that the many - point space - time correlation functions are not scale invariant in their time arguments . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of full scale invariance leads unavoidably to kolmogorov exponents . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the determination of of all the scaling exponents @xmath0 requires equations for infinitely many renormalized objects . </S>",
    "<S> one can however proceed in controlled successive approximations by successive truncations of the infinite hierarchy of equations.clues as to how to truncate without reintroducing power counting can be obtained from renormalized perturbation theory . to this aim </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fully resummed perturbation theory is equivalent in its contents to the exact hierarchy of equations obeyed by the @xmath1th order correlation functions and green s function . in light of this important result </S>",
    "<S> we can safely use finite resummations to construct successive closures of the infinite hierarchy of equations . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents the conceptual and technical details of the scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the high - order closure procedures which do not destroy the rescaling symmetry and the actual calculations fwork4or truncated models will be presented in a forthcoming paper in collaboration with v. belinicher .    </S>",
