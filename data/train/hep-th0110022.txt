    "an important question in the supersymmetric standard model is how supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in the low - energy world .",
    "this question has been mainly addressed in the context of four - dimensional effective theories with limited success , but recently the idea of extra dimensions has allowed for new possibilities  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the extra dimensional framework is particularly interesting because it provides a new geometrical perspective in understanding some of the problems of conventional theories . in particular , the nonlocal nature of communicating supersymmetry breaking across the compact bulk from one boundary to another",
    "can soften the divergences of the soft mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the horava - witten scenario  @xcite provides the prototype model in which to study the transmission of supersymmetry breaking via an extra dimension . in this model",
    "the transmission of supersymmetry breaking can become quite involved , and to calculate boundary soft masses one requires the bulk / boundary couplings .",
    "however , the essential features can be captured by studying a simpler five - dimensional super - yang - mills theory coupled to chiral matter on the boundary  @xcite . in this toy model",
    "the couplings between five - dimensional supermultiplets and four - dimensional boundary fields are obtained by working with off - shell supermultiplets and including the auxiliary fields . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite the dimensional reduction of bulk fields leads to new couplings between bulk and boundary fields which are required for consistency .",
    "in particular this allows for the construction of realistic low - energy models with bulk gauge fields in flat  @xcite and warped space  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study brane - world supersymmetry breaking in the case where only gravity propagates in the bulk while the chiral matter and gauge fields are confined to the four - dimensional boundaries .",
    "we assume that due to brane dynamics supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by effective brane superpotentials .",
    "this causes the tree - level gravitino mass spectrum to shift by a constant amount depending on the values of the brane superpotential  @xcite . at",
    "tree - level boundary chiral matter and gauge fields are massless but due to their gravitational interactions with the bulk gravitinos they will receive a supersymmetry breaking mass at one loop . just like the bulk gauge field case , one can use an off - shell formulation to study the bulk gravitational case as well .",
    "supersymmetric brane - world scenarios from off - shell supergravity have been formulated in refs  @xcite .",
    "we will predominantly use the results in ref .",
    "@xcite to study an off - shell formulation of supergravity in the context of supersymmetry breaking with brane superpotentials .",
    "in particular , we will show that after integrating out the auxiliary fields of the off - shell supergravity multiplet there are new couplings between bulk and boundary fields . just like the bulk gauge field case these couplings are required in order to obtain a consistent supersymmetric limit .",
    "the one - loop mass spectrum will continuously depend on the brane superpotential parameter , and due to the nonlocal nature of the supersymmetry breaking the masses will be finite .",
    "in fact we will see that one particular limit of our mass spectrum is the familiar scherk - schwarz limit  @xcite",
    ". actually depending on the size of the extra dimension our one - loop results can be of order the anomaly - mediated contributions  @xcite which arise from the one - loop rescaling anomalies .",
    "thus , although we do not discuss this issue in detail , our results could be relevant in solving the tachyonic slepton mass problem  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , after briefly reviewing the bulk vector multiplet case we consider the off - shell supergravity multiplet coupled to boundary fields . in particular we show that after integrating out auxiliary fields there are new couplings between boundary gauge fields and bulk supergravity fields .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is considered in section 3 , where we derive the unitary matrix responsible for diagonalising the kaluza - klein gravitino mass spectrum .",
    "this is important for determining the couplings between the boundary and bulk fields . as a further check , the same results",
    "will also be derived more directly using an explicit five - dimensional calculation . in section 4",
    "we calculate the one - loop gaugino and scalar masses for arbitrary values of the brane superpotential .",
    "we comment on the cancellations that are required for consistency and are satisfied by the new couplings . again , for completeness we will present the calculation of the soft mass spectrum using both the kaluza - klein sum in four dimensions , and the direct five - dimensional calculation .",
    "finally , our conclusion and comments will be presented in section 5 .",
    "we start from a pure @xmath4 five - dimensional poincar supergravity @xcite , compactified on an orbifold @xmath3 .",
    "our model will assume that only gravity propagates in the bulk whereas chiral matter and gauge fields will be confined to the 4d boundaries .",
    "thus all supersymmetry breaking effects will be transmitted by gravity and in particular the gravitino mass spectrum will shift . in order to study the transmission of supersymmetry breaking effects between the 4d boundaries it is necessary to work with an off - shell formulation of supergravity  @xcite . in this way all bulk - boundary couplings can be derived .",
    "a similar procedure for gauge fields and hypermultiplets in the bulk was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . before launching ourselves into the more involved case of supergravity coupled to boundary chiral and vector multiplets ,",
    "we briefly summarize the procedure and results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a @xmath5 bulk vector multiplet which is coupled to a chiral matter multiplet on the boundary .",
    "this will allow us to emphasize some key features which will also be present in the supergravity case .",
    "the five - dimensional @xmath5 multiplet with coupling constant @xmath6 contains a vector field @xmath7 , a real scalar field @xmath8 , and a gaugino @xmath9 .",
    "the five - dimensional yang - mills multiplet is then extended to an off - shell multiplet by adding an @xmath10 triplet @xmath11 of real - vauled auxiliary fields .",
    "here capitalized indices @xmath12 run over 0,1,2,3,5 , lower - case indices @xmath13 run over 0,1,2,3 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are internal @xmath10 spinor and vector indices , with @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "we now compactify the theory on @xmath0 and assign even @xmath18parity to the fields ^1_l , a^m , _",
    "l^1 , x^3 , and odd @xmath18parity to the fields ^2_l , a^5 , , _",
    "l^2 , x^1 , x^2  , where @xmath19 is the supersymmetry parameter of the @xmath20 supersymmetry transformations on the boundary at @xmath21 .",
    "a simple inspection of the supersymmetry transformations reveals that the fields @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 transform as the vector , gaugino , and the auxiliary @xmath25-field of a 4d @xmath20 vector multiplet @xcite .",
    "it is then obvious how to couple the five - dimensional gauge multiplet to a 4d dimensional chiral multiplet @xmath26 on the boundary .",
    "one writes the lagrangian as @xmath27 where the sum includes the walls at @xmath28 .",
    "the bulk lagrangian @xmath29 is the standard one for a 5d super - yang - mills multiplet , and the boundary lagrangian has the standard form of a four - dimensional chiral model built from the chiral multiplet and with the gauge fields @xmath30 replaced by the boundary values of the bulk fields @xmath31 .    to determine the couplings of the boundary chiral matter to the bulk vector multiplet one has to integrate out the auxiliary fields .",
    "integrating out the auxiliary field @xmath32 gives a boundary lagrangian of the form @xmath33~ ,   \\label{dofz}\\ ] ] and one finds new interaction terms at the boundaries ( apart from the usual ones in @xmath20 4d yang - mills theory coupled to chiral multiplet ) involving the scalar components of the chiral multiplet and the odd field @xmath8 @xcite .    by including the kinetic term of the field @xmath8 , the singular terms can be rearranged into a perfect square @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{-1}{2g_5 ^ 2 } \\int d^5x \\left[\\partial_5\\phi+g_5 ^ 2\\phi^\\dagger          \\phi \\,\\delta(x_5)\\right]^2 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] varying this action with respect to @xmath8 , one finds that the background expectation value of @xmath8 is given by @xmath35 substituting this solution into the lagrangian ( [ five ] ) one finds that the various singular terms @xmath36 cancel and one is left with the usual @xmath25-term interaction @xmath37 where @xmath38 . to summarize",
    ", we have learned that starting from an off - shell formulation of five - dimensional yang - mills theory compactified on @xmath0 which is coupled to chiral matter on the boundaries , new singular interaction terms appear after integrating out the auxiliary fields .",
    "the origin of these terms is clear : they are due to the presence of the physical propagating odd field @xmath8 in the effective auxiliary @xmath25-term on the boundary . at the level of the effective 4d theory ,",
    "the singular terms disappear after we substitute in the lagrangian the solution of the classical equation of motion for the odd field @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing though that the singular terms play a crucial role at the quantum level since they provide counterterms which are necessary in explicit computations to maintain supersymmetry  @xcite . in particular , the role of the interaction term proportional to @xmath36 is to cancel the singular behaviour induced in diagrams where the @xmath8-field is exchanged .",
    "we now want to extend the analysis of the previous subsection to the case of supergravity .",
    "the on - shell supergravity multiplet contains the fnfbein @xmath39 , the symplectic majorana gravitino @xmath40 , and the graviphoton @xmath41 .",
    "the five - dimensional bulk lagrangian reads  @xcite _ bulk & = & - 12 m_5 ^ 3 e_5 r_5 - 14 m_5 e_5 f_mn f^mn - 1 6 ^mnopq f_mn f_op a_q + & & + i m_5 ^mnopq |_o _ pq d_m _ n - i e_5 f_mn |^m ^n + & & + i ^mnopq f_mn |_o _ p _ q + 4 - fermion terms , [ lbulk ] where the five  dimensional coordinates are @xmath42 ; @xmath43 is the five  dimensional planck mass ( we will set it equal to one from now on unless otherwise stated ) ; @xmath44 ; @xmath45 is the five  dimensional scalar curvature ; @xmath46 , where the latter are the components of the fnfbein with four - dimensional indices ; finally , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the smallest five - dimensional off - shell supermultiplet contains 48 bosonic and 48 fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "this decomposes into a minimal multiplet with ( 40 + 40 ) components , containing the fnfbein , gravitino , graviphoton and several auxiliary fields which include an isotriplet scalar @xmath50 , an antisymmetric tensor @xmath51 , a gauge field @xmath52 , a spinor @xmath53 , and a scalar @xmath54 .",
    "in addition one has to introduce a compensator multiplet with ( 8 + 8 ) degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the compensator multiplet allows for the breaking of the gauged @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "there exist several possibilities for the compensator multiplet and we will assume that it is given by the tensor multiplet containing an isotriplet scalar @xmath56 , a spinor @xmath57 , a scalar @xmath58 and a vector @xmath59 ( which can be expressed as a supercovariant field strength of a three - form @xmath60 ) .",
    "the @xmath55 symmetry is gauged by the auxiliary field @xmath52 , and the gauge is fixed by requiring y= e^u(0,1,0)^t  , where @xmath61 is a scalar field .",
    "thus after gauge fixing the field content of the five - dimensional theory is given by ( e_m^a , _",
    "m , a_m , , v_ab , v_m,,c , u,,n , b_mnp )  .",
    "note that in flat space the choice of the tensor multiplet for the remaining ( 8 + 8 ) components is not unique .",
    "however , it is advantageous to use the tensor multiplet because it allows a straightforward generalisation to warped spaces .",

    "thus , the total contribution to the scalar mass - squared is given by @xmath282\\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\frac{-1}{12\\pi^2 ( \\pi r)^5 m_5 ^ 3 } \\int_0^\\infty dx\\ , x^4         \\left[\\coth(x ) - \\frac{\\sinh(2x)}{\\cosh(2x )           -\\cos(2\\pi \\delta)}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\frac{-1}{8\\pi^6 r^4 m_4 ^ 2 } \\left\\{\\zeta(5)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ { \\rm li}_5\\left(e^{-2\\pi",
    "i\\delta}\\right)+ { \\rm li}_5\\left(e^{2\\pi i\\delta}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this agrees with the result obtained from the kaluza - klein sum ( [ finalfinal ] ) .",
    "notice that we obtain a finite result because the leading divergences cancel in the integral ( [ 5dint ] ) , and the remaining part is exponentially suppressed .",
    "when matter is located on the brane at @xmath175 this cancellation no longer happens because the gravitino propagator ( [ gravproppir ] ) contains a cosine factor which depends on @xmath129 . only in the supersymmetric limit @xmath190",
    "does the cancellation in ( [ 5dint ] ) occur .",
    "this is just the 5d interpretation of the result ( [ infkk ] ) that we obtained earlier from the kaluza - klein summation .",
    "in this paper we have considered a supersymmetric five - dimensional brane - world scenario where the fifth dimension is compactified on @xmath0 . in our set - up chiral matter and gauge fields",
    "are restricted to live on the boundaries while gravity propagates in the bulk .",
    "we have assumed that supersymmetry is broken at the orbifold fixed points and that supersymmetry breaking is parametrized by a constant boundary superpotential .",
    "the bulk gravitino mass spectrum is consequently shifted relative to the bosonic bulk supergravity fields .",
    "integrating out the supergravity auxiliary fields allows one to derive the couplings between the boundary chiral matter or gauge fields and the bulk supergravity fields .",
    "if chiral matter or gauge fields live on a brane different from the one where supersymmetry breaking occurs , the latter is communicated to our observable world by gravitational interactions .",
    "we have computed the contribution to the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar and gaugino masses for generic values of the brane superpotential and the radius of compactification .",
    "the one - loop computation of the mass splittings generically provides a hierarchy of soft masses at the tev scale with nonvanishing scalar masses and zero gaugino masses .",
    "the nonvanishing superpotential on the boundaries and the relative shift in the bulk gravitino mass spectrum parametrize various possible sources of supersymmetry breaking at the fixed - points coming from fayet - iliopoulos @xmath25- and @xmath101-terms inducing nonvanishing brane superpotentials to keep the branes tensionless . in this paper",
    "we have assumed that these terms are coupled to the bulk only through supergravity .",
    "in addition for certain values of the radius @xmath148 the anomaly - mediated contributions of scalar masses will be of roughly the same order .",
    "it may be that a combination of brane supersymmetry breaking and the anomaly - mediated contribution can solve the well - known slepton mass problem .",
    "on the other hand since the one - loop gaugino masses vanish , the anomaly - mediated gaugino mass contributions will dominate .    in deriving the results of this paper we have worked with the components of the supermultiplets . in principle",
    "the same results can also be more simply derived using the @xmath20 superfield calculus , such as that considered in refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of bulk vector fields .",
    "this would require writing the @xmath4 supergravity lagrangian in terms of @xmath20 superfields , and then repeating the procedure already done for the bulk gauge fields .",
    "one should note that the supersymmetry breaking mechanism respects the tensionlessness of the branes even though we have added matter on the branes .",
    "this is because the goldstino is a bulk field . of course ,",
    "a brane tension may eventually be generated due to gauge symmetry breaking ( or even other forms of brane supersymmetry breaking ) .",
    "this may require considering more general warped bulk backgrounds .",
    "since we have used the tensor multiplet it is straightforward to generalize the procedure used here for warped geometries .",
    "in particular one could obtain the gravitational analogue of the warped soft mass spectrum calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , even if the branes remain tensionless , the vacuum energy is nonzero  @xcite and the radius is not stabilized .",
    "thus , one is likely to require the addition of further fields in the bulk in order to stabilize the radius  @xcite .",
    "these fields will arise when one embeds the brane - world setup in a more fundamental theory , such as string theory , and deserves further study .",

    "the evaluation of the infinite sum is only slightly more involved because of the presence of the factor @xmath249 . in this case",
