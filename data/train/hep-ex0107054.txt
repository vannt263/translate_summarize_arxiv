    "one of the most important goals of the l3 experiment at the lep collider was to find the higgs boson .",
    "in the standard model this particle is associated to the higgs field  @xcite , expected to provide mass to all the observed elementary particles .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson , , is not predicted by the theory . before the advent of lep",
    ", there was no solid experimental information about the higgs mass .",
    "the l3 experiment has carried out the search for the higgs boson at lep in very large data samples collected at the z resonance  @xcite and at ever increasing centre - of - mass energies and luminosities  @xcite greatly extending the higgs mass range investigated .",
    "a fit that includes l3 electroweak precision measurements results in an upper limit on of 133  @xcite at the 95% confidence level .",
    "previous l3 direct searches for the standard model higgs boson excluded the mass range up to 107  @xcite .",
    "similar results were also reported by other lep experiments  @xcite .",
    "results of the standard model higgs search obtained shortly after the end of the lep data taking in the year 2000 were also published by l3  @xcite and by the other lep experiments  @xcite .",
    "the standard model higgs boson is produced at lep mainly via the higgs - strahlung process .",
    "the processes of and fusion contribute , with smaller rate , to the higgs production in the and channels , respectively .",
    "the largest sources of background are four - fermion final states from and pair production , as well as quark pair production .    in this letter , the final results of the standard model higgs search performed on the data collected by l3 at lep at a centre - of - mass energy , , up to about 209are reported .",
    "these results include the full luminosity collected in the year 2000 and the corrected lep beam energies . in the year 2000",
    "lep was run at several values of .",
    "the slight beam energy adjustments significantly affect the signal expectation at the highest higgs masses , close to the kinematic limit for hz production , @xmath1 , where is the z boson mass .",
    "the effect of the z width in the higgs mass reconstruction close to the hz kinematic limit is also taken into account .",
    "final calibrations of all subdetectors are applied .",
    "the signal and background expectations are evaluated on a finer grid of values , with larger samples of simulated events , thus reducing statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "therefore , the results reported in this letter are affected by total uncertainties smaller than in reference  .",
    "the data were collected by the l3 detector  @xcite at lep during the year 2000 at several centre - of - mass energies .",
    "the total collected luminosity amounts to 217.3 .",
    "the data are grouped into seven samples corresponding to average centre - of - mass energies between 202.8and 208.6 .",
    "the integrated luminosities corresponding to these samples are given in table  [ table : lumi ] .",
    "the higgs production cross sections and branching ratios are calculated using the hzha generator  @xcite .",
    "efficiencies are determined using monte carlo samples of higgs events , generated with pythia  @xcite .",
    "since the higgs production cross sections and efficiencies depend strongly on , in particular for close to the hz kinematic limit , samples of higgs events are simulated at each centre - of - mass energy shown in table  [ table : lumi ] .",
    "higgs events are generated with between 105 and 120 , in steps of 1 .",
    "for each mass and each search channel , between 2000 and 10000 events are generated .",
    "the standard model background estimates rely on the following monte carlo programs : kk2f  @xcite for , koralw  @xcite for , phojet  @xcite for two - photon processes ( ) and excalibur  @xcite for other four - fermion final states .",
    "the number of simulated events for the dominant backgrounds is at least 100 times the number of events expected for such processes .",
    "the response of the l3 detector is simulated using the geant program  @xcite , taking into account the effects of multiple scattering , energy loss and showering in the detector .",
    "hadronic interactions in the detector are modelled using the gheisha program  @xcite .",
    "time dependent detector inefficiencies , as monitored during the data taking period , are also simulated .",
    "the search for the standard model higgs boson is based on the study of four distinct event topologies : , , ( @xmath2 ) and . + in the following they are denoted as , , and , respectively . with the exception of the decay mode",
    ", all the analyses are optimised for the @xmath3 decay .",
    "this mode represents about 80% of the higgs branching fraction in the mass range of interest .",
    "all the search channels are analysed in three stages .",
    "first , a high multiplicity hadronic event selection is applied to reduce the large background from two - photon processes , while preserving most of the higgs signal . in a second stage ,",
    "topological and kinematical variables together with b - tag variables are either used to construct an event likelihood or fed into a neural network , to further discriminate between signal and background events .",
    "a b - tag variable is calculated for each hadronic jet using a neural network  @xcite which exploits three - dimensional decay lengths , properties of semileptonic b decays and jet - shape variables .",
    "the tracking and b - tagging performance in the monte carlo simulation are tuned using 4of calibration data collected at @xmath4 in the year 2000 . the b - tagging performance for the high - energy data",

    "the expectation from the standard model monte carlo describes the data within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the neural network b - tag variables are combined into an event b - tag variable .",
    "first , the probability is calculated for each jet to be compatible with the distribution for light quarks determined from monte carlo .",
    "then , the event b - tag variable is defined as the negative log - likelihood of these probabilities .",
    "the last part of the analysis is the construction of a final discriminant for each topology .",

    "each given , the value of the log - likelihood ratio in the data is compared to the expected distributions of @xmath13 in a large number of simulated experiments under the `` background - only '' and the `` signal+background '' hypotheses . the results for each search channel are then presented in terms of @xmath13 for the data compared to the expected median values for the two hypotheses , as a function of .      the analysis aims to select and study events with four jets , two of which contain b hadrons , while the other two must be consistent with the decay of a boson .",
    "background from standard model processes comes mainly from final states with hard gluon radiation , and events , especially those where one of the bosons decays into b quarks .    after a high multiplicity hadronic preselection ,",
    "the events are forced into four jets with the durham algorithm  @xcite and a kinematic fit requiring four - momentum conservation is performed .",
    "several discriminating variables , @xmath14 , are combined into a single likelihood which is then used to select the final sample . in this combination ,",

    "for each class , probability density functions @xmath17 are derived from monte carlo .",
    "the probability for an event to belong to the event class @xmath15 , based on the value of the variable @xmath14 , is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 runs over all classes .",
    "the individual probabilities are combined into a likelihood : @xmath20 , where @xmath7 runs over all variables considered and @xmath19 over all event classes .",
    "ten variables are used to calculate the likelihood .",
    "they are :    * the number of tracks , * the event b - tag , * the maximum energy difference between any two jets , * the minimum jet energy , * the parameter of the durham algorithm for which the event is resolved from three jets into four jets , * the maximal triple - jet boost , defined as the maximum three - jet boost obtained from the four possibilities to construct a one - jet against three - jet configuration in a four - jet event , * the minimum opening angle between any two jets , * the event sphericity , * the mass from a 5c kinematic fit imposing energy and momentum conservation and equal dijet masses , @xmath21 , * the absolute value of the cosine of the production polar angle , @xmath22 , assuming the production of a pair of bosons .",
    "the distributions of the event b - tag , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the events selected in the search channel with @xmath24 , compared to the expectation for standard model processes , are shown in figure  [ fig : qqqqvari ] .",
    "events are selected into the final sample if the value of @xmath23 exceeds a threshold optimised for each centre - of - mass energy and each higgs mass hypothesis .",

    "a final discriminant is constructed . at first , the events are classified into three categories depending on the values of the b - tag of the two jets assigned to the higgs boson .",

    "a neural network is used for the analysis , very similar to the one previously reported  @xcite . however , tighter cuts on radiative photons and on the jet polar angle are applied to reduce the background and ensure the best jet energy and b - tag measurements .",
    "the signal efficiency is slightly reduced by a few percent relative but the search performance is not significantly modified .",
    "in addition , the neural network is trained with the final , high statistics , signal and background monte carlo samples , at each value , to maximise the sensitivity of the analysis .    in the first step of the analysis ,",
    "high multiplicity hadronic events are selected and forced into two jets using the durham algorithm .",
    "the dijet invariant mass must exceed 40 .",
    "these requirements reduce contributions from two - photon interactions , while retaining a significant fraction of hadronic events from and -pair production .",
    "these backgrounds are then reduced by requiring the visible mass to be less than 140and the mass recoiling against the hadronic system to lie between 50and 130 .",
    "events from are further suppressed by requiring the longitudinal missing energy to be less than @xmath34 and the missing momentum vector to be at least @xmath35 away from the beam axis .",
    "the energy in the forward luminosity calorimeter is required to be below 20 .",
    "the acollinearity is required to be smaller than 65@xmath36 .",
    "the distribution of the event b - tag after the above cuts is shown in figure  [ fig : qqnnvari ]  a. a loose cut requiring the event b - tag to be larger than 0.5 is then applied , without further loss of signal efficiency .",
    "after this set of cuts , there are 123 events in the data , while 130 are expected from background processes with 4.3 and 1.3 events expected for @xmath31 and 115 , respectively .",
    "a kinematic fit imposing four - momentum conservation and requiring the missing mass to be consistent with is performed to compute the reconstructed higgs mass from the two jets .",
    "the output of a mass independent neural network  @xcite is then combined with the reconstructed higgs mass to build the final discriminant .",
    "the distributions of the reconstructed higgs mass , the missing mass and the neural network output for the events selected in the search channel with @xmath24 , compared to the expectation for standard model processes , are shown in figure  [ fig : qqnnvari ] .",
    "general agreement between the data and the expected contributions from standard model processes is observed in all the distributions .",
    "the signatures for the and processes are a pair of high energy electrons or muons with an invariant mass compatible with and two hadronic jets with b quark content . in events",
    "the tau pair invariant mass must also be compatible with . for these events , the mass resolution is worse than in the other channels due to the missing neutrinos from the tau decays .",
    "events with higgs decaying into tau leptons , , have similar signature to the events , with the difference that the hadronic jet mass must be compatible with and that the b - tag content of the event is reduced .",
    "the analyses are very similar to those described in reference  .",
    "the selections require high multiplicity events . in the and analyses two well identified electrons or muons",
    "are also required . in the tau analyses , tau leptons",
    "are identified either by their decay into electrons or muons , or as an isolated low - multiplicity jet with one or three tracks and unit charge .",
    "the identified leptons must have a large opening angle and must be well isolated from the hadronic jets . for all selections , the invariant mass of the leptons after a kinematic fit imposing four - momentum conservation must be consistent with within a mass range depending on the dilepton mass resolution . in the selection the mass of the two hadronic jets after kinematic fit must be consistent with .",

    "these results are used to evaluate confidence levels for the `` background - only '' and the `` signal+background '' hypotheses .",
    "the confidence level for the `` background - only '' hypothesis , @xmath37  @xcite , is the probability of observing in a large sample of simulated `` background - only '' experiments a more signal - like value of the log - likelihood ratio than is actually observed .",
    "the distribution of @xmath37 in a large sample of `` background - only '' experiments is uniform between 0 and 1 , thus its median expected value is 0.5 .",
    "an observed value of @xmath37 lower than 0.5 indicates an excess of events in data compared to the expected background .",
    "similarly , the `` signal+background '' confidence level cl@xmath38 is defined as the probability in a sample of `` signal+background '' experiments of observing a less signal - like value of the log - likelihood ratio than is actually observed .",

    "in addition , a systematic uncertainty on the background , which affects mostly the search region close to the hz kinematic limit in the and channels , is included depending on . thus the systematic uncertainty on the number of background events",
    "is estimated to be from 6% up to 15% for close and beyond the hz kinematic limit . the systematic uncertainty on the number of signal events is estimated to be between 3% and 6% , for close to and beyond the hz kinematic limit , to take into account the spread of values in the different data samples .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is uncorrelated from bin to bin in the final discriminant distributions and has little effect on the confidence level .",
    "bins of the final discriminant distributions with a @xmath12 ratio below 0.05 are not considered in the calculation of the confidence levels , as they degrade the search sensitivity once systematic uncertainties are included in the calculation .",
