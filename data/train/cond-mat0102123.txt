    "recently , zaanen brought up a problem of ` quantum string ' @xcite , which is a line - like object subjected to line tension , and it wonders owing to quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations .",
    "central concern is to estimate the interaction between adjacent strings as it wonders quantum - mechanically and undergoes entropy - reducing ` collisions ' with their neighbors .",
    "statistical mechanics of quantum - string gas would be relevant to the low - energy physics of the so - called stripe phase observed experimentally in doped cuprates @xcite . in particular , one is motivated to gain insights how the stripe pattern formed in cuprates acquires stability .",
    "actually , a good deal of theoretical analyses had predicted tendency toward stripe - pattern formation @xcite .",
    "however , first - principle simulations on the @xmath4-@xmath5 model still remain controversial about that issue @xcite .",
    "the aim of the aforementioned recent analysis @xcite is to shed light , particularly , on the role of the quantum fluctuations and the entropy - reducing collisions at the expense of disregarding microscopic ingredients of quantum string .    in the path - integral space - time picture ,",
    "quantum string spans a world sheet as time evolves @xcite .",
    "hence , one may wonder that physics of quantum string might bear resemblance to that of membrane , and so quantum string is readily understood through resorting to the past outcomes about membrane @xcite . however , nature of elasticities is different : quantum - string s elastic energy is quadratic in its slope ( line tension ) , whereas membrane s is quadratic in its curvature ( bending elasticity ) .",
    "this seemingly slight difference causes , according to ref . , quite distinctive behaviors .",
    "when quantum string is laid down in a free space , its hamiltonian is quadratic , and thus no peculiarity emerges .",
    "( we will introduce the hamiltonian afterwards . ) yet , when it is squeezed by adjacent neighbors or walls , there immediately arise awful complications due to many - body correlations . in order to tackle with the string gas",
    ", zaanen employed helfrich s technique @xcite , that has been utilized in the course of the studies of stacked membranes .",
    "thereby , he arrived at the conclusion that collision - induced energy cost @xmath6 would be described by @xmath7 with string interval @xmath0 .",
    "that result can not be understood in terms of conventional argument @xcite which gives @xmath8 ; this argument is based on such picture that string is ` disordered , ' and the collisions are mainly due to short - wave - length meandering modes .",
    "( we will outline this argument in sec .",
    "[ section3_2 ] . ) on the contrary , zaanen emphasizes the role of long - wave - length fluctuations , because his theory is sensitive to infrared cutoff .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to judge the validity of those scenarios by performing first - principle simulations .",
    "we put a quantum string between rigid walls with spacing @xmath0 , and measured its repelling interaction by observing pressure against the walls .",
    "( this trick has been used in the studies of the fluctuation pressure of ( classical ) membrane @xcite . )",
    "the hamiltonian , which we had simulated , is given by , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 denotes the operator of transverse displacement of a particle at @xmath11th site , and @xmath12 is its conjugate momentum .",
    "they satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath13={\\rm i}\\hbar \\delta_{ij}$ ] , @xmath14=0 $ ] and @xmath15=0 $ ] .",
    "@xmath16 is rigid - wall potential with spacing @xmath0 ; @xmath17 @xmath18 denotes line tension which puts particles into line .",
    "classical version of this hamiltonian has been used as a model for line dislocations and steps on ( vicinal ) surfaces @xcite . note that for sufficiently large @xmath18 , one can take continuum limit , with which one arrives at field - theoretical version of quantum string .",
    "such continuum - limit version was studied analytically in ref . .",
    "for small @xmath18 , however , continuum - limit treatment fails , and our lattice - version hamiltonian exhibits characteristics which are not considered in the previous study .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explicate our simulation scheme .",
    "we used diagonalization method : note that elastic models such as ours ( [ hamiltonian ] ) have vast number of vibration modes , which overwhelm computer - memory size .",
    "emphasis is laid upon the point how we had adopted the idea of density - matrix renormalization group @xcite to quantum string so as to reduce the number of hilbert - space bases .",
    "our algorithm is indebted to recent developments @xcite , where a polaron model ( lattice vibration ) was simulated with use of the density - matrix renormalization group ; see also ref . .",
    "following the preparations , in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , we perform numerical calculation . we show that our first - principle simulation supports aforementioned zaanen s scenario . in the last section ,",
    "we give summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we explain our simulation algorithm . emphasis is laid on the point how we had adopted the idea of the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite in order to treat quantum string .",
    "afterwards , we will show preliminary simulation data so as to demonstrate its performance .",
    "quantum string is made of many particles connected with line tension @xmath18 .",
    "each particle spans infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "hence , one is forced to truncate , somehow , the number of bases in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian . even though one truncated bases of each particle , the total bases of quantum string , as a whole , would exceed available computer - memory size .",
    "this difficulty arises inevitably in treating elastic ( bosonic ) degrees of freedom by means of diagonalization .",
    "recently , however , zhang _ et al . _",
    "reported that the difficulty is overcome by an ingenious application of the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "actually , they demonstrated that a polaron model is diagonalized successfully ; see also ref . .",
    "in the following , based on these recent developments , we propose a scheme to diagonalize the quantum - string hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "our simulation algorithm proceeds recursively ; after the completion of one recursion ( renormalization ) , the number of treated particles ( length of quantum string ) is enlarged by two , and subsequent renormalization follows . in the following",
    ", we explain steps constituting one renormalization procedure : suppose that our system ( quantum string ) is decomposed into four parts , that is , block , site , site and block , in this order .",
    "after one renormalization is completed , composite systems of block and site are ` renormalized ' into a new block with block hilbert - space dimension _",
    "unchanged_.    as would be guessed , ` site ' merely stands for one particle of quantum string .",
    "we then need to prepare bases to represent the hilbert space of ` site . '",
    "we had chosen such @xmath19 bases that are the eigenstates @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) of the intra - site hamiltonian @xmath22 with energy @xmath23 .",
    "( therefore , the direct product of @xmath20 gives the eigenstate of the total hamiltonian @xmath24 , provided that the line tension is tuned off ( @xmath25 ) . ) with respect to these bases @xmath26 ( @xmath27-@xmath19 ) .",
    "we represent the matrix of the @xmath10 operator ; @xmath28_{nm}= { } _ \\bullet \\langle n | x | m \\rangle_\\bullet =   \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\frac{2d}{\\pi^2}\\left (    \\frac{1}{(m+n)^2}-\\frac{1}{(m - n)^2 }                     \\right )   & ( n , m)={\\rm ( even , odd)\\ or\\ ( odd , even ) }                                                                        \\\\ 0 & { \\rm otherwise } \\end{array } \\right .    .\\",
    "] ] the truncation bound @xmath19 is one source of numerical errors .",
    "we need to choose @xmath19 sufficiently large ; we will demonstrate afterwards that this truncation does not deteriorate simulation precision in practice .",
    "let us turn to explaining ` block .",
    "' the ` block ' stands for a part ( fragment ) of quantum string , and actually , it contains many particles in it .",
    "hence , at a glance , one may wonder that the hilbert - space dimension of block would be extremely large . yet , owing to the density - matrix renormalization , the dimension is reduced so that it can be stored in computer memory .",
    "the hilbert space of block is spanned by those bases @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the bases are to be prepared in the _ preceding _ renormalization procedure ; see below . with respect to these bases , one has to represent the intra - block hamiltonian @xmath31 and the coordinate operator of the particle at the end of ` block ' @xmath32 ; see below . at the initial stage of renormalization ,",
    "the block is merely a ` site , ' and so we start with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "provided that the above matrices are at hand , the ( total ) hamiltonian of quantum string is expressed in terms of them ; @xmath36 diagonalizing this matrix , one obtains the ground state , @xmath37 with use of @xmath38 , we obtain the density matrix for the left - half sub - system ( @xmath39 ) ; @xmath40_{i , j;i',j ' }       = \\sum_{kl } \\psi_{ijkl}\\psi^*_{i'j'kl } .\\ ] ] diagonalizing this , we obtain the eigenstates and the eigenvectors ; @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "those bases @xmath43 with large weight @xmath44 would be important ( relevant ) in order to describe the physics of the sub - system of block and site .",
    "therefore , we store the bases @xmath45 with @xmath27-@xmath46 , and discard the others .",
    "this criterion is the essence of the so - called density - matrix renormalization group @xcite . that truncation may cause another source of numerical errors",
    "later , we will demonstrate that this error is very small . finally , we perform the ` density - matrix renormalization ' ; @xmath47_{nm } & = & \\left\\langle u_n \\left|      { \\cal h}_{\\rm b}\\otimes \\hat{1 }   + \\hat{1 } \\otimes { \\cal h}_\\bullet    + \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left (   x_{\\rm b}^2 \\otimes \\hat{1 } -2 x_{\\rm b } \\otimes x_\\bullet               + \\hat{1 } \\otimes x_\\bullet^2",

    "we can restart the next renormalization from the beginning , replacing the renormalized block @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "it is to be noted that through the renormalization , the block dimension is kept within @xmath46 .    in the following",
    ", we will show that the above algorithm actually works . in fig .",
    "[ fig_relative_error ] , we plotted the relative error of the ground - state energy @xmath50 for the system with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "( this parameter condition is of great physical significance as would be shown in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] . )",
    "the system size is @xmath53 , and the dimension of ` site ' is @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the full number of bases is @xmath55 , which is about to exceed the limit of available computer - memory size and is barely manageable with full diagonalization method . for these full bases , we calculated the ` exact ' ground - state energy , while ` approximate ' energy is calculated by means of the density - matrix renormalization group with truncated ` block ' dimension @xmath46 .",
    "the energy difference between them gives @xmath56 .",
    "the relative error @xmath50 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_relative_error ] .",

    "it is far beyond the capability of the diagonalization method to treat longer string , unless we resort to the density - matrix renormalization group .",
    "in this section , we present simulation results . in our simulation",
    ", we treated sufficiently large system sizes by repeating renormalizations , until simulation result converges to a ( thermodynamic ) limit .",
    "system parameters of @xmath46 and @xmath72 are fixed ; namely , we set @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "those parameters just fix the coefficient of the kinetic - energy term .",
    "therefore , the choice of parameters does not harm any generality .",
    "technical details are to be referred to the previous section .      in fig .",

    ", we arrive at the relation @xmath85 . to summarize , for small @xmath81 , inter - particle interaction is irrelevant . on the other hand , for large @xmath0 , the inter - particle interaction may become relevant .",
    "because of this , the particles become correlated , and @xmath6 drops very rapidly .    in order to elucidate characteristics of fluctuation - induced interaction ,",

    "we will explore this in the next subsection .      here",
    ", we re - examine the data of @xmath6 and @xmath75 presented in figs .",
    "[ fig_f ] and [ fig_b ] . for that purpose",
    ", we need to resort to past outcomes on @xmath6 and @xmath75 .",
    "first , we summarize recent remarkable predictions by zaanen @xcite . in his theory , @xmath75 works as a mean field , which is to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the self - consistency equation to be solved is , @xmath89 appearance of logarithmic term brings about subtleties .",

    "( [ sc_condition ] ) , under the assumption that the string - meandering modes are ` compactified ' ( frozen ) , he found another self - consistency condition , @xmath91 note that the validity of this relation is checked , if we assume eq .",
    "( [ f_small_d ] ) .",
    "hence , this relation ( [ sc_condition ] ) may be realized for small @xmath0 .",
    "besides those recent treatments , there exists an ingenious argument @xcite for tackling with entropic interaction .",
    "the argument , applied for quantum string ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , yields predictions different from the above .",
    "below , we outline this argument : as is mentioned in introduction , in the path - integral picture , quantum string bears resemblance to ( classical ) membrane . when quantum string is embedded in a free space",
    ", we can solve its mean deviation @xmath92 with membrane s linear dimension @xmath93 .",
    "suppose that the wall width ( mean membrane interval ) is @xmath0 , with use of this relation , one obtains an estimate of the surface @xmath94 per one collision such as @xmath95 .",
    "assuming that each collision ( contact - or - crossing ) gives rise to entropy loss @xmath96 , we obtain the collision - induced energy gain per unit surface ; @xmath97 the argument is based on the assumption that the string would be disordered spatially as in the einstein - like view of a crystal . in other words ,",
    "short - wave - length fluctuations contribute to collisions . on the contrary , ref .",
    "emphasizes the significance of long - wave - length fluctuations .",
    "our aim is to judge which picture is valid by means of first - principle simulations .    guided by the above ideas , we will carry out scaling analyses .",

    "[ fig_f ] and [ fig_b ] .",
    "note that @xmath99 should be constant , if eq .",
    "( [ sc_condition2 ] ) holds .",
    "the scaling plot indicates that for @xmath81 , in fact , the scaled data are kept constant . on the contrary , for @xmath83 , the scaled data drop suddenly , suggesting that eq .",
    "( [ sc_condition2 ] ) does not hold any more . in consequence",
    ", we confirmed that for small @xmath0 , string - meandering modes are ` compactified ' ( irrelevant ) .",
    "these observations are consistent with those found in the previous subsection .",
    "secondly , let us turn to large-@xmath0 regime . in fig , [ fig_scaling2 ] , we plotted @xmath100 against @xmath101 with use of the data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_f ] and [ fig_b ] .",
    "note that the scale of abscissa is logarithmic .",
    "therefore , the data should align , if the relation ( [ sc_condition ] ) is satisfied .",
    "in fact , for scaling regime @xmath102 , we see that the scaled data get aligned , and exhibit a positive slope .",
    "this result justifies the validity of eq .",
    "( [ sc_condition ] ) .",
    "namely , the mean - field treatment of ref . appears to capture the essence of this physics .",
    "for exceedingly large @xmath0 , eventually , numerical data become scattered ( unstable ) gradually .",
    "this is a symptom of numerical errors .",
    "note that for exceedingly large @xmath0 , the elasticity modulus @xmath75 is very small so that it suffers from tiny numerical errors .",
    "hence , we can not continue simulations for extremely large @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_scalings ] , we presented similar scaling data but for various @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the plots show that the scaling - plot slopes are identical .",
    "this fact tells that the constant @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ sc_condition ] ) is indeed universal with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "it is , however , suggested that @xmath108 is subjected to a correction to scaling , because plots do not overlap precisely .",
    "we had found that scaling data for very small @xmath109 are not described by eq .",

    "underlying physics of these relations are rather astonishing @xcite : it is speculated that collisions rather contribute to straightening the quantum string . in this subsection , we will examine this remarkable scenario through observing the mean fluctuation deviation , @xmath120 in fig .",

    "precision is crucial in our study , because we need to calculate second - order derivative in order to obtain the elasticity modulus @xmath75 ( [ modulus ] ) .",
    "secondly , based on those preparations , we have performed extensive simulations .",

    "<S> quantum string , which was brought into discussion recently as a model for the stripe phase in doped cuprates , is simulated by means of the density - matrix - renormalization - group method . </S>",

    "<S> embedding a quantum string between rigid walls with separation @xmath0 , we found that for sufficiently large @xmath0 , collision - induced energy cost obeys the formula @xmath1 with @xmath2 , and string s mean fluctuation width grows logarithmically @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> those results are not understood in terms of conventional picture that the string is ` disordered , ' and only the short - wave - length fluctuations contribute to collisions . </S>",
    "<S> rather , our results support a recent proposal that owing to collisions , short - wave - length fluctuations are suppressed , but instead , long - wave - length fluctuations become significant . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism would be responsible for stabilizing the stripe phase . </S>"
