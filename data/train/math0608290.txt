    "there are relatively few general results on existence , uniqueness and regularity of solutions of partial differential equations in the complex domain when the conditions of the classical cauchy - kowalewski ( c - k ) theorem are not met .",
    "the c - k theorem holds for first - order analytic systems ( or those equivalent to them ) with analytic non - characteristic data , and for these it guarantees local existence and uniqueness of analytic solutions .",
    "as is well known , its proof requires convergence of local power series expansions .",
    "evolution equations with higher spatial derivatives do not satisfy the c - k assumptions and even when formal power series solutions exist their radius of convergence is zero .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to provide a theory for existence , uniqueness and regularity of solutions in such cases , in a relatively general setting .",
    "the theory also applies to classes of equations of higher order in time and sufficiently high order in space after reduction ( by well known transformations , see _ e.g. _",

    "properties of solutions of pdes in the complex plane , apart from their intrinsic interest , are relevant for properties in the real domain , as initial singularities in @xmath21 may give rise to blow - up at later times in the physical domain .",
    "representation of solutions as borel sums is instrumental in extending techniques originally developed for odes @xcite to find the location and type of singularities of solutions to nonlinear pdes @xcite .",
    "it is certainly difficult to give justice to the existing theory of nonlinear pdes , and we mention a number of results in the literature relevant to the current paper . for certain classes of pdes in the complex domain sammartino and caflisch @xcite , @xcite proved the existence of nonlinear prandtl boundary layer solutions for analytic initial data in a half - plane .",
    "this work involves inversion of the heat operator @xmath22 and uses the abstract cauchy - kowalewski theorem for the resulting integral equation . while their method is likely to be generalizable to certain higher - order partial differential equations , it appears unsuitable for problems where the highest derivative terms appear in a nonlinear manner .",
    "such terms can not be controlled by inversion of a linear operator and estimates of the kernel , as used in ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the complex plane setting , as well as the type of nonlinearity allowed in our paper , do not allow for an adaptation of classical , sobolev space based , techniques .",
    "this can be also seen in simple examples which show that existence fails outside the domain of validity of the results we obtain .",
    "certainly , many evolution equations are amenable to our setting ; to illustrate canonical form transformations and the general results we chose a third order equation with quartic nonlinearity arising in fluid dynamics .",
