    "majorana fermions are exotic particles , where their anti - particles are their own particles @xcite .",
    "since kitaev @xcite found that an unbound pair of majorana fermions can be realized in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - polarized superconductor , a considerable effort has been devoted to studying semiconducting wires @xcite and cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite for realization of majorana fermions .",
    "in addition , majorana fermions are robust against local perturbations due to the topological degeneracy .",
    "therefore , it may be potentially applied to quantum information processing such as quantum memory @xcite and topological quantum computing @xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms have been used for simulating various quantum many - body phenomena @xcite .",
    "for example , quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator @xcite has been shown in lattice bosons . also , spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has been shown in an experiment @xcite , where the two atomic spin states are coupled to their momentum states by using a pair of lasers . in fact , so coupling is essential to realize topological matter @xcite . therefore , ultracold atoms pave the way for studying topological phases @xcite .",
    "recently , so - coupled dipolar condensates have been theoretically studied @xcite .",
    "the intriguing ground state of ultracold atoms can be displayed via the interplay of so coupling and magnetic dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) .",
    "indeed , dipolar interactions in ultracold atomic gases can give rise to spectacular quantum phenomena @xcite such as spin texture @xcite and einstein - de haas effect @xcite .",
    "in addition , a chromium gas in an optical lattice @xcite has recently been realized .",
    "since a chromium atom has a relatively large magnetic dipole moment @xcite , the inter - site interactions become strong enough @xcite to experimentally study quantum magnetism @xcite .    in this paper , we consider spin - orbit coupled bosonic atoms in a 1d optical lattice , where the atoms at the different sites couple to each other via the magnetic dipolar interactions @xcite . in the mott - insulating regime , this system can be described by the quantum xyz spin model with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions in a transverse field @xcite , where a two - component boson in each site can be viewed as a spin - half particle @xcite .",
    "indeed , a spin chain is equivalent to a 1d spinless fermion model by performing the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "this enables us to study the topological phenomenon , such as majorana fermions , with a quantum spin chain @xcite .",
    "the long - ranged ddi leads to interactions between the two atoms at the different sites .",
    "it is important to examine the effect of long - ranged interactions on the topological phases @xcite .",
    "although the magnetic dipolar interactions between the atoms are weak , such strengths are comparable to effective coupling strengths between the spins @xcite in the mott - insulating regime . therefore , _ the effect of so coupling , ddi and transverse field on the topological phases can be studied in a controllable manner_.    here we study the energy difference between two degenerate ground states in the two different parity sectors to determine the topological phase @xcite .",
    "when the energy difference becomes zero , the topological degeneracy occurs in the system .",
    "although the dm interactions break the @xmath0 symmetry in this system @xcite , the system exhibits the topological phase if the dm interactions are sufficiently small .",
    "we find that the so couplingz incorporate with repulsive ddiz can be used to exhibit topological phases .",
    "a topological phase is shown when the so coupling strength increases with the dipolar interaction strength .",
    "also , the ddi can broaden the range of so coupling and transverse field strengths for exhibiting topological phases .",
    "therefore , this may lead to observing topological phases in 1d so - coupled dipolar lattice bosons .",
    "in addition , we show that the sum of all spin - polarization correlations between nearest neighbouring atoms can be used for characterizing the magnetic properties of a spin chain . when the system is in a topological phase , the sum of spin correlations is close to zero .",
    "this coincides with the topological phase which is determined by using the energy gap between the two different parity sectors .",
    "in fact , spin correlations between the spins in the different sites have been probed in a 1d optical lattice @xcite .",
    "thus , this can be used for detecting the topological phases in experiments .",
