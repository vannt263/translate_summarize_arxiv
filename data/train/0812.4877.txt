    "in order to investigate how a rotationally supported disk is formed inside a collapsing core , we have mapped the protostellar system hh 111 , which is in the class i phase and is thus expected to have a bigger disk than that in the class 0 phase . in this system ,",

    "[ fig : linemap ] ) .",
    "the emission shows similar structures to those seen in cs @xcite .",
    "it shows a north - south elongation roughly perpendicular to the jet axis , tracing a flattened envelope around the vla 1 source .",
    "the emission also extends slightly to the west along the jet axis and southwest along the outflow cavity wall outlined by the reflection nebulae .",
    "the emission is more extended , tracing both the envelope and the outflow cavity walls . the so emission is more compact with a narrow waist around the source .",
    "it also extends along the outflow cavity walls in the southeast , southwest , and northwest directions .",
    "the dark ridge , where the line emissions all peak , has been suggested to be the birthplace of both the vla 1 and 2 sources @xcite and thus can be assumed to be the center of the flattened envelope .",
    "the , , and so spectra toward the dark ridge all show a similar fwzi of @xmath0 6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the so spectrum is rather symmetric with a single peak at the systemic velocity . the and spectra show a double - peaked profile with a dip coincident with the so peak , and with the blueshifted peak brighter than the redshifted peak ( i.e. , the blue asymmetry ) . comparing to the single - dish observations toward a larger region",
    ", we find that there is missing flux in and within @xmath0 1 of the systemic velocity as the large - scale flux is resolved out in our interferometric observation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_sd ] ) .",
    "note that , however , since missing flux tends to produce a dip with similar redshifted peak and blueshifted peak , an additional mechanism is still needed to produce the observed dips with the blue asymmetry . it could be self - absorption due to an infall motion in the envelope ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "infall motion has already been suggested by @xcite using cs observations .",
    "the emission is optically thicker and thus shows a deeper and wider absorbing dip than the emission .",
    "the so emission does not show a dip , likely because it is optically thin due to low so abundance .    in order to show the kinematics of the flattened envelope ,",
    "the emission is divided into four velocity components : low redshifted and blueshifted emission with velocity within @xmath0 1 from the systemic , and high redshifted and blueshifted emission with velocity higher than 1 from the systemic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linemap ] ) . at low velocity",
    ", the emission clearly shows a flattened structure with the blueshifted and redshifted emission extended @xmath0 ( 2800 au ) to the north and south , respectively , from the dark ridge , as expected for a rotating envelope .",
    "the redshifted emission fits right in between the eastern and western reflection nebulae in the south .",
    "this is to be expected since the reflection nebulae trace the regions with less extinction and thus low density in the boundary of the envelope .",
    "therefore , with the boundary defined by those reflection nebulae , the envelope is found to have a thickness of @xmath0 ( i.e. , 1000 au ) and roughly constant with increasing distance from the source .",
    "note that the blueshifted emission also traces the outflow emission in the west and the outflow cavity wall in the southwest . at high velocity",
    ", the emission shrinks toward to the source , arising from the inner part of the envelope .",
    "the blueshifted peak shifts slightly to the west and the redshifted peak slightly to the east .",
    "these shifts further suggest an infall motion in the envelope , with the blueshifted peak in the far end ( west ) of the envelope and the redshifted peak in the near end ( east ) , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "these shifts are also partly due to an outflow component , with the emission extended to the west and along the cavity walls . in",
    ", the blueshifted emission peaks to the northwest and redshifted emission in the southeast of the dark ridge even at low velocity .",
    "as seen in the spectrum , the lowest - velocity emission , which traces the flattened envelope further out , is missing more than the emission , and thus revealing the inner part of the envelope , where the radial motion becomes prominent .",
    "in so , the blueshifted and redshifted emission are also seen to the northwest and southwest of the dark ridge , similar to that seen in .",
    "the so emission is likely optically thin , probing directly the inner part of the envelope .",
    "the rotational velocity of the flattened envelope can be studied with the position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams centered at the dark ridge cut perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "the and emission show similar kinematics ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pvs]a , b ) and can be studied together .",
    "the blueshifted emission is seen mainly to the north and redshifted emission mainly to the south , confirming a rotation in the envelope . at low velocity ,",
    "the blueshifted and redshifted emissions also extend across the center to the south and north , respectively , suggesting that there is also a radial motion in the envelope .",
    "the rotational velocity is seen increasing toward the center and thus could be keplerian or that conserving specific angular momentum . in the case of keplerian rotation ,",
    "the best fit to the velocity structures in these two line emissions together is @xmath15 with @xmath16 au ( i.e. , ) , which is slightly faster than that found in cs at lower angular resolution by @xcite .",
    "this keplerian rotation corresponds to a stellar mass of @xmath0 0.8 . here",
    ", the plane of the flattened envelope is assumed to have an inclination of 10 away from the line of sight @xcite . in the case of conservation of specific angular momentum ,",
    "the best fit is @xmath17 . with a reduced @xmath18",
    ", it seems to fit better than the keplerian rotation , which has a reduced @xmath19 and decreases too fast toward the center as compared with the observed . to confirm it , however ,",
    "both observations at higher angular resolution and shorter @xmath20 spacings are needed .",
    "the latter is to retrieve the missing flux at low velocity .",
    "the so emission traces only the inner part of the envelope .",
    "its velocity structure is not well resolved and seems to have two components : a low - velocity component in the inner part with the velocity within @xmath0 1.5 of the systemic , and a high - velocity component in the outer part with the velocity higher than @xmath0 1.5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvs]c ) .",
    "the low - velocity component seems to have a radius of @xmath0 ( 200 au ) and a differential rotation with the velocity increasing toward the center .",
    "the high - velocity component extends to @xmath21 1.3@xmath22 ( @xmath0 500 au ) , connecting to that of the emission .",
    "its velocity , however , seems to increase with increasing distance from the center .",
    "it could arise from a solid - body ( rigid ) rotation with @xmath23 .",
    "it could also arise from an outflow motion .",
    "the radial motion in the envelope can be studied with the pv diagrams cut along the jet axis ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pvs]d , e , f ) .",
    "the pv diagrams , however , are highly contaminated by the outflow emission , especially on the blueshifted side",
    ". only part of the emission close to the center to within e.g. , ( which corresponds to a deprojected distance of @xmath0 at an inclination of @xmath0 10 ) is believed to be from the envelope .",
    "the , , and so emission within @xmath0 from the center seem to show similar velocity structure .",
    "the blueshifted emission is mainly in the west and the redshifted emission is mainly in the east . on the redshifted side ,",
    "where the outflow contamination is less , the velocity seems to increase toward the center .",
    "this velocity structure is unlikely due to an outflow motion for which the velocity is expected to decrease toward the center ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "it could arise from an infall motion in the envelope , as suggested . for a dynamical collapse",
    ", the infall motion can be assumed to be a free - fall motion as in @xcite , with the infall velocity @xmath24 .",
    "three values of @xmath25 , 2.4 , 1.9 , and 1.5 , are compared to the , , and so velocity structures , with the second value corresponding to that obtained by @xcite .",
    "the corresponding stellar masses are 1.3 , 0.8 , 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the one with the least mass seems to give the best fit , matching the emission at the lowest velocity in the redshifted part where the contamination of the outflow emission is less .",
    "however , observation at higher angular resolution is really needed to confirm it .      in order to obtain roughly the density distribution of the flattened envelope , a simple disklike envelope model as described in @xcite is compared to the emission , which suffers less missing flux than the emission . in this model , the envelope has a free - fall motion and a rotation with conservation of specific angular momentum , with the best - fit parameters given above .",
    "it has an inner radius of @xmath26 , an outer radius of @xmath27 , and a constant thickness of @xmath28 , in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the number density of molecular hydrogen is assumed to be given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the density at @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a power - law index assumed to be @xmath33 , as in many theoretical infalling models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "radiative transfer is used to calculate the emission , with an assumption of local thermal equilibrium .",
    "for simplicity , the line width is assumed to be given by the thermal line width only .",
    "the channel maps of the emission derived from the model are convolved with the observed beam and velocity resolution , and then used to make the integrated map , spectrum , and pv diagram .",
    "there are six parameters in this model : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . in our fits",
    ", we have @xmath38 au ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath39 au ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath40 1000 au ( i.e. , ) , @xmath41 , @xmath42 k , and @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is assumed to be the lower end of the dust temperature . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelc18o ] , this model can roughly reproduce the envelope structure , spectrum , and pv diagram of the emission , except for the emission at high - redshifted velocity . the position of the two peaks in the line profile can also be roughly matched with the assumed infall velocity .",
    "note that , however , the temperature power - law index is required to be steeper here in order to reproduce the observed dip at the systemic velocity , as compared to those ( @xmath45 ) obtained by fitting other envelopes in single - dish observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". it could be because the dip is partly due to the missing flux of the large - scale gas and the absorption by this large - scale gas as well .",
    "the mass of the flattened envelope , which is given by @xmath46 is @xmath47 , consistent with that found by @xcite .",
    "this mass is higher than that derived from the continuum emission , which is more compact . in our simple model",
    ", the infall rate , which is given by @xmath48 has a mean value of @xmath49 , averaged over the radius .",
    "the accretion rate , if assumed to be the mean infall rate , would result in an accretion luminosity of @xmath50 , assuming a stellar mass of @xmath51 ( as derived from the infall velocity ) and a stellar radius of @xmath52 .",
    "this luminosity , however , is about twice the luminosity of the source , which is @xmath0 20 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the accretion time would be only @xmath0 5@xmath53 yr for forming a source with a mass of 0.5 , shorter than that for a typical class i source .",
    "thus , the accretion rate could be smaller than the infall rate .",
    "the envelope seen in and can be considered as a thick torus around the narrow dust lane ( i.e. , the dark ridge ) , with an inner radius of 400 au ( ) , an outer radius of 3200 au ( ) , and a thickness of 1000 au ( ) .",
    "it has a differential rotation that seems to be better fitted by a rotation with conservation of specific angular momentum than by a keplerian rotation as assumed by @xcite .",
    "the envelope likely also has an infall motion , with the blueshifted emission in the far end and the redshifted emission in the near end , showing a double - peaked line profile with a blue asymmetry and an absorption dip at the systemic velocity .",
    "therefore , the envelope seems to be infalling ( contracting ) toward the center preserving its angular momentum , similar to other infalling envelopes in the class i phase @xcite and even in the class 0 phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the derived rotation and infall velocity structures , the rotation velocity is equal to the infall velocity at @xmath54 ( 600 au ) , suggesting that the centrifugal force starts to dominate in the inner edge of the envelope .",
    "the inner envelope is seen in so as in hh 212 @xcite .",
    "it has an outer radius similar to where the centrifugal force starts to dominate .",
    "therefore , a rotationally supported disk is expected to form here .",
    "such a disk may indeed have formed in the inner part of this inner envelope , which is seen with a differential rotation , spatially coincident with the narrow dark ridge that could be interpreted as a dense circumstellar disk @xcite . the outer part of this inner envelope , however , may have a rotation velocity decreasing toward the center .",
    "if this is the case , the angular momentum might have been efficiently removed from there .",
    "this can be achieved with the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it has been found that a magnetic field can enforce solid - body rotation because magnetic braking can eliminate differential rotation on a timescale much shorter than even the free - fall timescale @xcite .",
    "currently , the most popular model of star formation is shu s model ( derived from * ? ? ?",
    "one recent version of this model assumes the collapse of a magnetized singular isothermal rotating toroid @xcite . in this model",
    ", a pseudodisk ( a nonrotationally supported thick torus ) is formed around the source . in the inner edge of the pseudodisk ,",
    "the rotation speed drops steadily with decreasing radius , as a result of efficient braking by the strong magnetic field .    in our observations",
    ", it is possible that the flattened envelope seen in and is a pseudodisk resulting from the collapse of a magnetized rotating toroid toward the center .",
    "it is also possible that the outer part of the so envelope is the inner edge of the pseudodisk where the rotation velocity decreases with decreasing radius due to efficient magnetic braking .",
    "however , further observations are really needed to confirm the rotation velocity structure in the flattened envelope and to tell whether the structure of the infalling material is magnetically - guided .",
    "in addition , a slow outflow , which is expected when there is a twisting of magnetic field lines @xcite , has not yet been identified in our observations .    in their model ,",
    "a rotationally supported disk is not able to form around the source due to the efficient loss of angular momentum @xcite . in the hh 111 system",
    ", such a disk must have already formed around the source to launch the jet .",
    "in addition , the innermost part of the disk has been seen as a tiny dusty disk ( with a radius of 30 au ) around the source @xcite . as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "one possibility is to have an ohmic resistivity in the model , so that the magnetic field can be dissipated efficiently around the source .",

    "it could be because there is a lack of gas toward the continuum peak .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that the vla 1 and vla 2 sources were originally formed in the dark ridge inside the envelope but later ejected from there .",

    "<S> an inner envelope is seen in so , with a radius of @xmath0 500 au ( ) . the inner part of this inner envelope , which is spatially coincident with the dust lane , seems to have a differential rotation and thus may have formed a rotationally supported disk . </S>",
    "<S> the outer part of this inner envelope , however , may have a rotation velocity decreasing toward the center and thus represent a region where an infalling envelope is in transition to a rotationally supported disk . </S>",
    "<S> a brief comparison with a collapsing model suggests that the flattened , torus - like envelope seen in and could result from a collapse of a magnetized rotating toroid . </S>"
