    "a basic application of quantum computation is solving the problem of finding a marked item among @xmath1 items .",
    "a classical computer takes @xmath6 steps to find this item with constant probability , but grover s algorithm @xcite shows that a quantum computer can solve this problem using only @xmath2 steps , which is optimal @xcite .",
    "however , grover s algorithm is unsuited to searching physical databases as it requires performing a reflection about a superposition of all possible items .",
    "if the items are distributed in space then this reflection is a nonlocal operation .",
    "a locally realisable search algorithm requires that the items are distributed in a @xmath0-dimensional space and that the quantum computer ( viewed as a `` quantum robot '' @xcite ) can only perform local operations to explore this database .",
    "aaronson and ambainis @xcite constructed such an algorithm that finds a marked item in the optimal time of @xmath2 in @xmath3 dimensions and @xmath7 in @xmath5 .",
    "their algorithm uses a carefully optimised recursive search on subcubes , which raises the question of whether simpler algorithms with the same running time ( or better in @xmath5 ) can be constructed .",
    "quantum walks on lattices provide a natural framework for the spatial search problem .",
    "given an @xmath1-vertex graph @xmath8 , a continuous - time quantum walk is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath9 acting on the @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space spanned by the states @xmath10 for all vertices @xmath11 of @xmath8 .",
    "a general state @xmath12 is described by @xmath1 complex amplitudes @xmath13 and evolves according to the schrdinger equation @xmath14 for the spatial search problem , we start in a state @xmath15 that is independent of the marked item and easy to construct ( e.g. , the uniform superposition of all vertices ) and evolve @xmath15 for a prescribed time , after which we measure the state in the vertex basis .",
    "the algorithm is successful if the result of the measurement can be used to guess the marked item with constant probability ( or with a sufficiently large probability that can be amplified with reasonable computational overhead ) .",
    "we require that @xmath9 is _ local _ in the sense that @xmath16 is nonzero only if @xmath11 and @xmath17 are adjacent in @xmath8 .",
    "following previous continuous - time quantum walk algorithms for spatial search , we choose @xmath9 to be of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the _ lattice hamiltonian _ , which is independent of the marked item , and @xmath20 is the _ oracle hamiltonian _ , which perturbs the lattice hamiltonian to single out the marked item .",
    "we require that @xmath19 is local and that the support of @xmath20 is localised within a constant radius around the marked item .",
    "quantum walk algorithms for spatial search have been studied previously . in @xcite ,",
    "childs and goldstone considered the case where @xmath8 is a hypercubic lattice in @xmath0 dimensions and @xmath19 is its adjacency matrix ( or equivalently , its laplacian matrix ) .",
    "it was found that the full quantum speedup of @xmath2 could be achieved in @xmath21 dimensions , whilst for the `` critical '' dimension @xmath22 , a time of @xmath23 is required for a constant probability of success . however , for @xmath24 , the algorithm does not provide quadratic speedup over classical algorithms .",
    "subsequently , ambainis , kempe , and rivosh @xcite found a discrete - time quantum walk algorithm that runs in time @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath23 for @xmath5 . unlike the continuous - time case",
    ", a discrete - time quantum walk can not be defined on the state space of the graph alone but instead requires a coupling to additional degrees of freedom usually called `` coins . ''",
    "following @xcite , childs and goldstone @xcite developed a continuous - time quantum walk algorithm with similar coin registers that has the same performance . in the analysis of @xcite , the failure of the algorithm in @xmath24 can be viewed as a consequence of a quadratic dispersion relation near the ground state of @xmath19 , which is the starting state of the algorithm .",
    "inspired by the dirac equation , additional `` spin '' degrees of freedom were introduced as coin registers to construct a hamiltonian with a `` dirac point '' in the dispersion relation .",
    "the linear behaviour of the dispersion relation near this point was exploited to reduce the critical dimension from @xmath22 to @xmath5 .",
    "recently , foulger , gnutzmann , and tanner @xcite noted that the similar dispersion relation found in the adjacency matrix of a honeycomb lattice can be used to construct a continuous - time quantum walk algorithm with running time @xmath23 in two dimensions without a coin degree of freedom .",
    "in this paper we construct hamiltonians for efficient spatial search algorithms on hypercubic lattices in @xmath25 dimensions that do not use external memory .",
    "we do this by introducing periodic inhomogeneities to the lattice hamiltonian @xmath19 instead of taking the adjacency matrix of the graph ( which is homogenous across the lattice ) .",
    "this can be naturally treated as a crystal consisting of a periodic lattice with multiple items at each lattice site ( sometimes called a lattice with a basis ) .",
    "the periodic inhomogeneities enable us to construct hamiltonians with dirac points , which in turn allows us to reduce the critical dimension from @xmath22 in @xcite to @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , we present a framework for describing spatial search algorithms using continuous - time quantum walks on arbitrary crystal lattices ( subject to certain technical conditions ) .",
    "this construction naturally generalises the results of @xcite and is closely related to the ones described in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea , similar to the staggered fermion formalism @xcite , is that coin degrees of freedom can be embedded into the lattice as additional vertices , where the coin registers become cells in the crystal and each cell contains a number of vertices equal to the dimension of the coin space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coin - cell ] ) . of course",
    ", a naive implementation of this embedding does not result in a hypercubic lattice since the interactions of the coin registers and the original lattice introduce additional edges in the graph , and furthermore turn the marked item into an entire marked cell rather than a single marked vertex .",
    "nevertheless , we show that with further modifications , the structure of a hypercubic lattice can be recovered .",
    "the items within a cell can be viewed as an effective coin , but by a careful choice of oracle hamiltonian , our approach allows for any vertex to be a possible marked item .",
    "as such , the degrees of freedom in our approach correspond directly to the items in the database , unlike in @xcite where the coin is represented using external memory .",

    "[ en : gen2 ] and [ en : gen3 ] , the behaviour of the last two terms for @xmath266 is dominated by the behaviour around @xmath267 .",
    "in particular , linearity of the dispersion relation around the dirac points ensures that @xmath268 is bounded and in fact converges to some value @xmath269 , while @xmath270 converges to some value @xmath135 for @xmath3 and diverges logarithmically for @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we can expand these expressions in the eigenbasis of @xmath19 and approximate them by integrals ( similarly to ) so that @xmath271 to find an eigenvalue gap of @xmath272 ( or @xmath273 in @xmath5 ) , the eigenvalue condition should be @xmath274 ; we choose @xmath20 to achieve this .",

    "finally , the same calculations as in section  [ sec : grid - analysis ] show that for @xmath3 , evolving @xmath15 for a time @xmath83 results in a constant overlap with @xmath288 in case 1 and @xmath70 in case 2 , while for @xmath5 , evolving for @xmath85 results in an overlap of @xmath29 .",

    "the connected components are both isomorphic to two - dimensional square lattices and the underlying hamiltonian acts on these as @xmath322 this gives an alternative hamiltonian for searching a two - dimensional square lattice with near - quadratic speedup .",

    "our framework can be used to construct equivalent hamiltonians without external memory by embedding these additional degrees of freedom into the lattice as additional vertices .",
    "the naive way of doing this introduces many additional nonzero transition amplitudes ( i.e. , edges ) in @xmath19 so that the underlying graph is not isomorphic to a hypercubic lattice .",

    "the procedure is versatile and can in principle be applied to any continuous - time quantum walk spatial search algorithm to reduce the external memory at the cost of possibly introducing additional edges into the graph and requiring multiple runs to ensure success .",

    "it would be interesting to improve the complexity further or to show that no such improvement is possible .",
    "we remark that if the locality constraint is relaxed to only require an interaction strength that monotonically decreases with the distance , it is possible to construct a hamiltonian that achieves the optimal @xmath2 running time in @xmath5 .",
