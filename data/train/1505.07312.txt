    "ramsey theory is a central area in combinatorics which concerns structure that must exist in arbitrary ( but large ) configurations .",
    "the classical starting point for graph ramsey theory considers the number of vertices required in order for every 2-edge - coloring of a sufficiently large complete graph to contain a monochromatic copy of a fixed complete graph @xmath2 @xcite . over the century , many other target subgraphs were considered , from the specific , such as paths @xcite , to trees and cliques @xcite , to entire classes such as graphs with bounded degree @xcite and degeneracy @xcite .",
    "this paper explores an interesting ramsey - type problem about paths , and so we briefly outline some of the history . in undirected graphs , an old result of gerencsr and",
    "gyrfs @xcite established that the corresponding 2-color ramsey number of an @xmath0-vertex path is precisely @xmath3 .",
    "when the number of colors increases beyond two , however , less is known .",
    "the result for three colors was proved asymptotically by figaj and uczak @xcite , and recently for large @xmath0 by gyrfs , ruszink , srkzy , and szemerdi @xcite .",
    "another flavor of ramsey - type results , which also inspires the work in this paper , stems from the following celebrated theorem of erds and szekeres @xcite : every sequence of @xmath0 distinct real numbers contains a monotone subsequence of length at least @xmath4 .",
    "this is often proven by the pigeonhole principle .",
    "indeed , assign to each number an ordered pair @xmath5 , where @xmath6 tracks the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that number , and @xmath7 tracks the decreasing analogue .",
    "since the numbers are distinct , it is easy to see that the ordered pairs must also be distinct , and therefore some ordered pair has an element at least @xmath4 .",
    "many extensions have been found for this theorem ( see , e.g. , any of @xcite ) .",
    "the same pigeonhole argument also proves the following straightforward result .",
    "consider the transitive tournament on the vertex set @xmath8 , where the edge between @xmath9 is oriented in the direction @xmath10 .",
    "then , every 2-coloring of the edges of @xmath11 has a monochromatic ( directed ) path with at least @xmath4 vertices ( hereafter called the _ vertex - length _ ) .",
    "the generalization to monochromatic paths in with @xmath12-colored tournaments ( with sharp lower bound @xmath13 ) was independently rediscovered multiple times @xcite .",
    "this problem can also be restated in terms of the _ ordered ramsey number _ of a path ; see , e.g. , any of @xcite for a discussion of recent work in ordered ramsey theory , several of which consider paths ( in the context of hypergraphs ) .",
    "this paper discusses several questions that start from this classical argument , leading to surprising and interesting connections across combinatorics .",
    "this serendipitous tour passes through directed graph ramsey theory , to @xmath14-majority tournaments ( applied to create constructions for ramsey tournaments ) , and ultimately to the borders of a foundational problem of ruzsa and szemerdi on induced matchings .",
    "indeed , with two colors , the concept of `` monochromatic '' is unambiguous . with three or more colors ,",
    "however , there is another natural generalization of the basic concept : one can seek substructures which are _ 1-color - avoiding _ , i.e. , in which there is at least one color which does not appear at all .",
    "( in the 2-color setting , these two concepts are identical . ) already in the 3-color setting , this problem is not well - understood .",

    "one may obtain a bound @xmath16 using the 2-color result , and the following standard construction achieves @xmath17 when @xmath0 is a perfect cube : identify the vertex set with the triples @xmath18 , ordered lexicographically , and color an edge @xmath19 based upon the leftmost position at which the triples differ .",
    "the best result , however , is still unknown .",
    "it turns out that there are interesting connections between this problem and a longstanding open question which traces back to a result of ruzsa and szemerdi @xcite on induced matchings , which has rich connections to szemerdi s regularity lemma ( see , e.g. , the survey @xcite ) .",

    "leveraging this connection , and using the current best bounds on problem [ prb : rsz ] ( due to fox s @xcite result on the triangle removal lemma ) , we obtain a non - trivial lower bound on @xmath15 . here , @xmath26 is the iterated logarithm , or the inverse of the tower function @xmath27 , @xmath28 . also , we write @xmath29 to mean that there exists a positive constant @xmath30 such that @xmath31 for all sufficiently large @xmath0 .",

    "setting , the result is not even known for transitive tournaments , and so we focus on that case here . recall that @xmath53 is defined as the maximum number @xmath0 such that every 3-coloring of the edges of the transitive @xmath54-vertex tournament contains a directed path of vertex - length at least @xmath0 , which avoids at least one of the colors .",
    "we begin by stating an equivalent and independently natural problem .",

    "consider this coloring , and follow the erds - szekeres proof .",
    "associate a triple of numbers to each vertex , with @xmath74 corresponding to the @xmath14-th vertex , where @xmath75 is the number of vertices in the longest path that ends at the @xmath14-th vertex and avoids the first color , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the corresponding statistics for avoiding the second and third colors , respectively .",
    "consider any two triples @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath9 . since there are three colors overall , there are two colors which differ from the color of edge @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath30 be one of them .",
    "then , the longest path which avoids color @xmath30 and ends at the @xmath78-th vertex can be extended by edge @xmath10 , to end at @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding coordinate ( for color @xmath30 ) of @xmath58 must be strictly less than that of @xmath59 .",
    "this holds also for the other color which differs from @xmath10 , and so @xmath58 is strictly less than @xmath59 in at least two coordinates .",
    "we have verified the necessary properties produce a valid construction for problem [ prb : triples ] with @xmath54 triples , all of whose entries are at most @xmath0 .",

    "since there is a 1-color - avoiding directed path with more than @xmath0 vertices , this implies that some entry of some @xmath90 exceeds @xmath0 , as claimed .",
    "the final statement ( iii ) hinges on two observations : the sequence @xmath91 is monotonic , and consecutive terms increase by at most one . to see that the latter is true ,",
    "consider an arbitrary 3-edge - coloring of the transitive @xmath54-vertex tournament , and extend it to a 3-edge - coloring of the transitive @xmath92-vertex tournament by coloring all edges to the @xmath92-st vertex in the first color .",
    "this would then contain a 1-color - avoiding path of vertex - length at least @xmath93 , which interacts with the @xmath92-st vertex in its final vertex , if at all .",
    "therefore , the original 3-edge - coloring of the @xmath54-vertex tournament contained a 1-color - avoiding path of vertex - length at least @xmath94 , hence @xmath95 , as claimed .",
    "now suppose that @xmath71 and @xmath72 . by ( i ) , we have @xmath80 , and by ( ii ) , we have @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath56 is an integer , this implies @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , since we have established that @xmath97 is monotonic with consecutive terms increasing by at most one , and we also know that @xmath98 and the sequence is unbounded , this determines @xmath56 for every positive integer @xmath0 . since each @xmath56",
    "can only take one value , this establishes both directions of the final if - and - only - if statement .",

    "these types of tournaments have been actively studied in social science @xcite , as well as in combinatorics , where previous researchers studied extremal problems regarding the sizes of dominating sets @xcite and transitive subtournaments @xcite .",
    "problem [ prb : triples ] is connected to bounding transitive subtournaments in a natural class of constructions of @xmath14-majority tournaments .",

    ", one must consider all elements of each permutation , because ties need to be broken .",
    "however , when @xmath0 is large , the main asymptotic may be dictated by transitive subtournaments which are entirely resolved by the first element of every permutation ( with no ties ) .",

    "therefore , for every vertex , the sum of the degrees of its neighbors is at most the number of matchings @xmath0 ; summing over all @xmath166 vertices , the number of two - edge walks in the graph is at most @xmath167 . since this is also precisely the sum of the squares of the degrees , convexity implies @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the average degree .",
    "therefore , the average degree is at most @xmath4 , which implies that there are at most @xmath170 edges , and @xmath160 as claimed .",

    "<S> we also expose connections to a family of constructions for ramsey tournaments , and introduce and resolve some natural generalizations of the ruzsa - szemerdi problem which we encounter through our investigation . </S>"
