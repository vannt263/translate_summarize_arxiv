    "turbulent flows are often studied under the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy ( see , for a review , ref .",
    "such assumptions are convenient for theoretical studies but are not always justified physically .",
    "for example , it is well known that stratification or rotation applied to neutral flows lead to anisotropic turbulence ( see ref .",
    "isotropy is even more difficult to justify in astrophysics where a magnetic field is almost always present at the largest scale of the system .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) approximation has proved to be quite successful in the study of a variety of space plasmas . during the last quarter of century",
    "many studies have been devoted to incompressible mhd turbulence in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "one of the most clearly established results is that the presence of @xmath1 leads to a bi - dimensionalization of an initial isotropic energy spectrum : the turbulent cascade transfers energy preferentially to perpendicular wavenumbers , in the direction transverse to @xmath0 .",
    "constant - flux spectra are known to occur in many instances in turbulent flows , the best example of which being the kolmogorov energy spectrum following a @xmath5 law for three - dimensional navier - stokes turbulence ( see ref .",
    "power law spectra are also measured in turbulent mhd flows but the value of the scaling index is still hardly discussed in the community .",
    "the first prediction in mhd was given independently by iroshnikov and kraichnan in ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter ik ) .",
    "they argued that the destruction of phase coherence by alfvn waves traveling in opposite directions along the local large scale magnetic field introduces a new timescale and a slowing down of energy transfer to small scales .",
    "assuming isotropy , the dimensional analysis for three wave interactions leads to a @xmath6 spectrum for the total energy ( see also ref .",
    "many direct numerical simulations of strong turbulence in isotropic ( @xmath7 ) mhd have been made during the last years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) but a definitive conclusion about the spectrum index is still not achieved mainly because the kolmogorov and ik predictions are very close ; furthermore , such scaling laws may be slightly altered by intermittency effects , and the numerical resolution is barely sufficient to determine such spectral indices .",
    "goldreich and shridar in ref .",
    "@xcite proposed in 1995 a heuristic model of strong turbulence for anisotropic ( moderate @xmath1 ) mhd where the distinction between the perpendicular ( @xmath8 ) and parallel ( @xmath9 ) wavenumbers is made .",
    "this model is based on a critical balance between linear wave periods @xmath10 and nonlinear turnover timescales @xmath11 for which the equality @xmath12 is assumed to hold at all scales in the inertial range .",
    "( only the symmetric case , for which the alfvn waves traveling in opposite directions carry equal energy fluxes , is considered here and in the remainder of the paper . )",
    "then the one dimensional perpendicular power spectrum for the total energy scales as @xmath13 whereas the parallel and perpendicular spatial sizes of eddies are correlated according to the scaling law @xmath2 .",
    "the latter prediction is rather new ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) and seems well observed in recent direct numerical simulations for moderate @xmath1 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as is well known , in the limit of large @xmath1 mhd turbulence becomes strongly anisotropic the formalism of weak alfvn wave turbulence developed by galtier et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite is well adapted to this situation .",
    "it leads to the so  called wave kinetic equations for which the exact power law solution for the total energy is @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 is undetermined because of the dynamical decoupling of parallel planes in fourier space ( this is the signature of the absence of energy transfer along the @xmath1 direction ; it thus represents a shadow of the initial conditions ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the wave kinetic equations show clearly such a constant - flux spectrum but it also reveals the existence of a transient spectrum during the front propagation towards small scales with a steeper power  law in @xmath16 , the dynamics of which is not yet clarified ( see ref .",
    "the discovery of such transient spectra in wave turbulence and the possible existence of a family of solutions that are not caught by the usual technique of conformal transform ( given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) constitute a new exciting topic of research where some progress is currently being made ( see , for example , ref .",
    "when using a shell model of strong turbulence , it has also been found in ref .",
    "@xcite that , when considering the decay of energy in time as a power law , initial transients occur that also follow power  laws to leading order and that precede the final power  law decay of the energy ; the origin of such transients in time may well be a transient in the fourier energy spectrum preceding the establishment of a kolmogorov  like spectrum , although this point has not been documented yet .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a heuristic model that describes anisotropic mhd flows for the regimes of strong ( moderate @xmath1 ) and weak wave ( strong @xmath1 ) turbulence as well as the transition between them . as a result of our analysis",
    ", a family of solutions is found for the anisotropic total energy spectrum from which the transient spectrum described above is a particular solution .",
    "we show that the model supports the same anisotropic scaling law between the parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers as the one found in the context of critical balance but it is more general in the sense that here we do not impose equality between linear wave periods and nonlinear turnover timescales which allows us to use the ik phenomenology .",
    "we finally propose to extend the anisotropic model to two other types of fluids .",
    "the presence of the mean magnetic field @xmath1 leads to anisotropy and thus to different variations with wavenumber directions , leading us to distinguish between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely we will assume that @xmath19 , _",
    "i.e. _ that under the external agent ( here , @xmath20 ) , the turbulent flow develops principally in the direction perpendicular to this agent . we will consider the symmetric case for which , in particular , the _ r.m.s .",

    "the fluctuations are distributed isotropically and there is only one timescale , the nonlinear time or eddy turnover time @xmath11 , which is also the transfer time of the energy to small scales within the system , @xmath23 .",
    "the rate of energy transfer per unit mass writes @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total energy . in the very same spirit",
    ", we can develop the ik phenomenology for anisotropic mhd turbulence using explicitly the fact that the eddy turnover time is @xmath26 and the alfvn wave period is @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that these two timescales are _ not _ equal which allows us to use the ik phenomenology .",

    "tr = _ nl , [ relation2 ] as is known to be the case for three - wave interaction processes ( see ref .",

    "ik_a ~v^4 ^2 b_0 .",
    "[ epsik ] we now define the anisotropic energy spectrum , e ( , ) ~^- ^- , [ alphabet ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are unknown .",

    "the total energy is recovered by directly integrating the spectrum along @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for a rigorous definition ) .",
    "it is important to note at this stage a difference with the classical phenomenology where the energy spectrum is not introduced with unknown indices but rather deduced by the analysis .",
    "we introduce relation ( [ alphabet ] ) into ( [ epsik ] ) , and by noticing that @xmath34 , we obtain : b_0 e_ik_a ~^4 - 2 ^1 - 2 , which can also be rewritten in terms of a ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) relationship as : ~ ( b_0 e_ik_a)^1 1 - 2 ^4 - 22 - 1 . [ ani2",
    "] this is our first anisotropic relation . in order to proceed further",
    ", we are now seeking a second relationship between the two scaling indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "one way to obtain a unique relation between them is to use the assumption of constant ratio between @xmath11 and @xmath10 at all scales . in other words",
    ", we will assume that = [ chi ] is a constant at all scales but not necessarily equal to one as it is in the critical balance model in ref .",
    "it is important to note that the precise value of @xmath35 is not important in itself since it is just a numerical factor that does not change the power law scaling .",
    "however if @xmath35 is smaller than one we are allowed to use the ik phenomenology instead of the k41 one for @xmath36 .",
    "a ratio of one seems to be very restrictive and does not correspond to some of the results stemming from direct numerical simulations where @xmath35 can be smaller than unity , as observed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , a two - dimensional geometrical case where local anisotropy is possible , or in solar wind _ in situ _ measurements ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) where @xmath35 seems to be smaller than unity .",
    "it is also in apparent contradiction with wave turbulence theory for which we have @xmath37 .",
    "we will see that the assumption of constant ratio at all scales is sufficient to achieve a unified model that describes both strong and weak mhd turbulence . with the definition of the timescales given above ,",
    "we obtain ~ .",
    "[ relationchi ] including expression ( [ relationchi ] ) into ( [ epsik ] ) gives : ~e_ik_a^1/3 ^4/3 b_0 ^2/3 .",
    "[ ani4 ] if we use explicitly the fact that both @xmath35 and the rates of energy transfer per unit mass do not depend on the scale ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we finally obtain ~^2/3 b_0 .",
    "[ ani5 ] this leads us to the first main conclusion of this paper : the same scaling in wavenumbers as the critical balance model is obtained when @xmath35 is _ not _ equal to unity , when the ik phenomenology is used .",
    "it thus seems to be a general law for incompressible mhd turbulence , when either the kolmogorov phenomenology for energy transfer or the @xmath28 three - wave formulation of energy transfer is utilized , as long as a critical balance ( generalized to any ratio differing from unity ) is assumed between stretching by velocity gradients and wave motions in the presence of a uniform field @xmath1 .",
    "another important and somewhat unexpected consequence of this analysis has to deal with the scaling of the energy spectrum . in the context of critical balance",
    ", it is claimed that the energy spectrum derived with an anisotropic kolmogorov phenomenology scales like @xmath38 .",
    "here we show that it is in fact possible to find a multitude of spectral indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 that satisfy the assumption of constant ratio @xmath35 at all scales in the inertial range .",
    "such indices follow in fact a general linear relationship . to find this relation we need to equalize the power - law behaviors found in relations ( [ ani2 ] ) and ( [ ani5 ] ) between the parallel and perpendicular distribution of modal energy in fourier space .",
    "if we use explicitly the fact that the rates of energy transfer per unit mass do not depend on the scale ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we finally obtain 3 + 2= 7 .",
    "[ ab ]    relationship ( [ ab ] ) is general and can be used for strong turbulence as well as for weak wave turbulence .",
    "note that the relationship ( [ ab ] ) is compatible with the anisotropic kolmogorov spectrum ( with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) as advocated by goldreich and sridhar in ref .",
    "@xcite , and with the anisotropic ik - like spectrum corresponding to three - wave interactions for weak mhd turbulence ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) ( see ref .",
    "we conjecture that it is compatible with the physics of the transitional regime between weak and strong mhd turbulence as well . in other words",
    "the law ( [ ab ] ) we just derived shows that the @xmath43 scaling between a dependence of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is not a unique signature of the kolmogorov spectrum but rather a signature of the rate at which energy is transfered to small scales where it is dissipated , a trace of the decay of energy , and as such an unavoidable dimensional law",
    "the preceding remark may be linked to the heretofore unexplained following finding : using direct numerical simulations in two space dimensions , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the structure functions of order @xmath44 based on the energy flux to small scales ( as expressed in terms of the exact laws for mhd turbulence derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ) have a self ",
    "similar scaling in the inertial range which is compatible with the scaling for the velocity structure functions in fluid turbulence , whereas the structure functions of the basic fields ( velocity and magnetic fields ) are more intermittent insofar as they depart more significantly from a linear scaling with @xmath44 .",
    "what this paper shows is that both models ( k41 and ik ) can be seen in a unifying way , illustrated by the law ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "note that in the case of the advection of a passive tracer such as temperature , it also seems that the scaling of the structure functions based on the flux of the tracer is close to the fluid scaling laws ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas the tracer itself is well  known to be strongly intermittent .",
    "more surprisingly perhaps , the choice of @xmath45 and @xmath46 also satisfies the law ( [ ab ] ) derived in this paper .",
    "this @xmath47 spectrum was found in ref .",
    "@xcite as a precursor to the constant flux solution of the alfvn wave kinetic equations which establishes itself later in time ; indeed , in that paper , the @xmath48 spectrum is found numerically for the case @xmath49 , without any dependence in @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath46 ) .",
    "the simple model proposed here thus sheds some light , albeit heuristically , on two intriguing facts that have emerged recently concerning weak wave turbulence : ( i ) the fact that , preceding in time the constant flux solution , a power - law spectrum ( called the precursor ) establishes itself the origin of which was unrelated to anything known about turbulence spectra ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) until now , and ( ii ) the fact that in some cases ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the weak wave turbulence regime , a wealth of power - law solutions in the @xmath50 plane can be found numerically as stationary solutions to the wave kinetic equations , although it is not clear whether such solutions are attractive , nor whether they are stable .",
    "the link between the dimensional argument given here which allows to recover the @xmath45 precursor spectrum , and the self - similar argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is compatible with the @xmath45 spectrum , remains to be clarified .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite one recovers the numerically observed law of self - similar decay of the energy spectrum , assuming that the energy spectrum scales in the precursor phase as @xmath47 , whereas in this paper we give a heuristic justification to that same @xmath51 law in terms of dimensional arguments compatible with three - wave interactions and with the assumption that there is no @xmath32 dependency in the precursor solution . we show furthermore that this law stems from the same type of unified approach that also gives the other known spectra for mhd turbulence . in order to ascertain the validity of the model derived here , numerical computations with the full three  dimensional mhd equations",
    "can be envisaged but being able to distinguish between different power laws which are close in their respective spectral indices may prove difficult . this point is currently investigated and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the argumentation delineated here could be used for other types of wave turbulence , like in the case of whistler waves ( see ref .",
