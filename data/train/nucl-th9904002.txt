    "most of our knowledge of the @xmath6 interaction has been obtained from heavy hypernuclei and it remains rather qualitative .",
    "in contrast , recent theoretical analyses of few - baryon systems with strangeness such as the three - body calculations of @xmath7@xcite and the four - body study of @xmath8@xcite yield more qualitative results , being based on modern baryon - baryon forces and on rigorous solutions of the few - body schrdinger equations .",
    "thus , they offer a great advantage to scrutinize @xmath6 interaction models . as an example , refs .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the nijmegen soft core @xmath6 interaction nsc89 @xcite binds the hypertriton , but the jlich @xmath9 potential@xcite does not .",
    "this is possibly caused by the sizable difference between the @xmath10 force components in the low - energy region@xcite .",
    "this shows that even basic quantities such as scattering lengths are still undetermined .",
    "the few - body analysis of @xmath7 @xcite has also clarified the effect of the @xmath11 conversion which was exactly included in the coupled channel formalism@xcite .",
    "although in the case of the hypertriton the admixture of @xmath12 states is only 0.5% , the expectation values of the sum of the transition potentials @xmath13 and @xmath14 are approximately 8% of the total potential energy , which is crucial for the binding of the hypertriton @xcite .",
    "this knowledge about the @xmath15 states coupling , however , has been obtained from the bound state lying below the @xmath16 threshold .",
    "this should be extended to analyses close to the @xmath15 threshold , where @xmath11 conversion effects will emerge sharply . in this region , so - called unstable bound states@xcite have received attention and have been searched for experimentally . only one state in the @xmath17 system is confirmed in the reaction @xmath18@xcite .",
    "the existence of such an unstable bound state in the a=4 system was predicted by harada _",
    "_ where the coupling to continuum @xmath19 states was approximated by a @xmath2 optical potential@xcite .",
    "however , for understanding the actual features of @xmath11 conversion , it is highly desirable to treat it directly using a realistic @xmath1 coupling interaction .    at present , it is technically possible to incorporate precisely the coupling to @xmath20 continuum states for only the @xmath2 and @xmath12 systems .",
    "afnan and gibson@xcite calculated the @xmath21 elastic scattering fully incorporating this coupling but using simple phenomenological @xmath6 interactions .",
    "they then found and analyzed enhancements just below the @xmath12 threshold . to examine more closely the @xmath22 coupling interaction ,",
    "a similar study applying more sophisticated meson - theoretical interactions is necessary .",
    "it is also important to analyze electromagnetic hyperon - production processes @xcite , which are experimentally accessible .    for the @xmath6 interaction ,",
    "there exists a variety of strengths for the @xmath1 coupling among extensively used meson - theoretical potentials .",
    "the soft core model@xcite and the hard core model d@xcite of the nijmegen group show cusps in the @xmath3 elastic total cross section just at the @xmath2 threshold with different magnitudes , while the nijmegen hard core model f@xcite and the jlich models@xcite show round resonance peaks below the threshold .",
    "we stress here that these prominent cusps do not mean simple threshold effects , but suggest the existence of @xmath0-matrix poles in unphysical riemann sheets .",
    "this is important because the poles might move and become unstable bound state poles if the coupling strengths varied .",

    "knowledge of @xmath6 @xmath0-matrix around the @xmath2 threshold is crucial for the analysis of @xmath23 continuum states using meson - theoretical interactions .",
    "this paper accordingly investigates poles of the @xmath0-matrices for the nijmegen f , d and the two soft core interactions@xcite .",
    "this is achieved in momentum space and hence the results are directly applicable to the three - body calculation . the behavior of @xmath0-matrices around an inelastic threshold in coupled channel problems and the effects of nearby poles have often been studied   @xcite . in such analyses",
    "it is important to understand the connection between various riemann energy sheets and how far from the physical region the poles are located . in this analysis",
    "we adopt a so - called uniformization given by newton@xcite , by which the @xmath0-matrix for two - channel problems becomes single - valued after a suitable variable is introduced in place of energy .",
    "we thereby clearly describe the positions and the trajectories of the @xmath0-matrix poles in the riemann sheets .",
    "section ii gives the expression for @xmath1 @xmath0-matrix which is analytically continued to the complex energy plane .",
    "section iii describes a method to treat a hard core potential in momentum space .",
    "this is for the purpose of treating the nijmegen hard core potentials which are influential in hypernuclear physics . in sec .",
    "iv , the uniformization mentioned above is introduced , thereby we discuss how the shape of the @xmath3 elastic total cross section around the @xmath2 threshold is related to the positions of nearby poles . in sec .",
    "v , the positions of the @xmath0-matrix poles for the nijmegen soft and hard core models are described .",
    "we also show the trajectories of the poles when the strengths of the potentials are increased .",
    "in this section , we give the expression of the off - shell @xmath0-matrix for the @xmath1 system and continue it analytically into the complex energy plane .",
    "the coupled @xmath0-matrices for the @xmath1 system are defined by the integral equations    @xmath24    with @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 have integer values of 1 and 2 for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 channels , respectively .",
    "the free hamiltonian @xmath29 for channel @xmath28 is defined as @xmath30 this refers to the total momentum zero frame and we denote the relative momentum between the nucleon and the hyperon by @xmath31 and the reduced mass of channel @xmath28 by @xmath32 .",

    "then eq .",

    "the extension to the case with couplings is straightforward .",

    "this set is solved in the following sections .",
    "although it is now rare to represent the short - range repulsion of the nn interaction by a hard core , the nijmegen d and f models of the @xmath6 interaction with hard cores are still used frequently in hypernuclear physics .",
    "therefore , in this section we explore a method to obtain the off - shell @xmath0-matrix for a hard core potential in momentum space .",

    "we therefore encounter a somewhat complicated riemann energy surface with four sheets , and must specify how they are related to the upper and lower halves of the @xmath107 and @xmath108 planes @xcite . in two - channel problems ,",

    "( [ eq:4.5 ] ) as @xmath126 or @xmath127 however , the expression ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) is not appropriate around the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "as already mentioned , this is because if the pole moves around the @xmath2 threshold , the quadrant to which @xmath128 belongs changes as @xmath120 , while the quadrant in which @xmath129 is located changes as @xmath118 .",

    "we should emphasize that the poles in the region [ 1,3 ] which produce the cusps are as equally important as those in the region [ 4,2 ] . to demonstrate this , we calculated the trajectory of the pole for the potential nd , multiplying it by an overall strength parameter @xmath140 . the trajectory is shown in fig  7 .",
