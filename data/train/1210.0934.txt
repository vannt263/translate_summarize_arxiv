    "the peculiar properties of single and multilayer graphenes make these systems the promising basis for the future generation of electronic devices . within this context",
    ", the analysis of the spectral properties of the phonon anomalies observed by means of different optical probes has provided a powerful tool not only for the characterization of the samples but also for the investigation of the underlying scattering mechanisms related to the electron - lattice interaction .",
    "large part of the investigation along this line has been based on the raman spectroscopy.@xcite typical main features under investigation within this context were the frequency and the linewidth of the phonon anomalies , whose trend as a function of doping was found to be in good agreement with what expected from the theoretical calculations of the phonon self - energy.@xcite as an alternative route , phonon peak anomalies at @xmath0 ev were detected also in the mid - infrared optical conductivity of bilayer graphene.@xcite quite interestingly , unlike in the raman spectroscopy , in this case a strong dependence of the phonon peak intensity as well as of its lineshape asymmetry on the gate voltage was reported .",
    "understanding and controlling the mechanisms responsible for these features at relatively small doping and perpendicular electric fields is of fundamental importance .    from a theoretical point of view , the very evidence of a strong infrared ( ir ) phonon activity , as the one reported in refs .",
    ", can be considered puzzling in graphenes which , having atoms of only one specie ( carbon ) , present a very small intrinsic dipole . in bilayer graphene , for instance , there are four carbon atoms in the unit cell , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ f - basis ] , where atoms b@xmath1 and a@xmath2 are connected by the vertical hopping @xmath3 .    there are two in - plane optical modes : an infrared active anti symmetric ( a ) @xmath4 mode , which corresponds to ( out - of - phase ) lattice displacements in the two layers ( fig .",
    "[ f - basis]a ) ; and a symmetric ( s ) @xmath5 mode , which is associated with in - phase displacements and is raman active ( fig .",
    "[ f - basis]b ) .",
    "if the two layers were completely decoupled , all the atoms would be exactly equivalent to each other .",
    "it is thus clear by direct inspection that , although allowed by symmetry , the @xmath4 mode would not induce any dipole and hence it would have no ir intensity .",
    "beyond this simple model of decoupled layers , in real systems , the interlayer hopping would induce a slight inequivalence between the atoms ( a@xmath1 , b@xmath2 ) and atoms ( a@xmath2 , b@xmath1 ) and hence a finite electrical dipole under the @xmath4 lattice displacements .",
    "the static dipole associated with such physics is however three orders of magnitude smaller than what is experimentally observed @xcite , so that this effect alone can not account for the huge increase of the phonon intensity upon gate - induced doping reported in ref . .",
    "a guideline to understand the origin of this huge enhancement comes from the comparison with other carbon - based compounds , like fullerenes , where also a similar increase of the phonon intensity upon ( chemical ) doping was observed .",
    "this effect was explained in those materials in terms of a charged - phonon theory.@xcite    the basic idea of the charged - phonon model can be understood by considering the electronic current ( @xmath6 ) response function @xmath7 , \\label{chijj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is related , within the kubo approach , to the optical conductivity as : @xmath8    a typical diagram contributing to the electronic background at the lowest order is depicted in fig .",

    "[ s : rice ] for a more detailed definition ) .",
    "the resulting optical conductivity of this contribution is thus proportional to the phonon propagator of the optically - coupled lattice vibrations , and it presents typical resonances at the corresponding phonon frequencies .",

    "<S> since their discovery , graphene - based systems represent an exceptional playground to explore the emergence of peculiar quantum effects . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper focuses on the anomalous appearence of strong infrared phonon resonances in the optical spectroscopy of bilayer graphene and on their pronounced fano - like asymmetry , both tunable in gated devices . by developing a full microscopic many - body approach for the optical phonon response </S>",
    "<S> we explain how both effects can be quantitatively accounted for by the quantum interference of electronic and phononic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the phonon modes borrow a large dipole intensity from the electronic background , the so - called charged - phonon effect , and at the same time interfer with it , leading to a typical fano response . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allows one to disentangle the correct selection rules that control the relative importance of the two ( symmetric and antisymmetric ) relevant phonon modes for different values of the doping and/or of the gap in bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the extension of the same theoretical scheme to the raman spectroscopy , to explain the lack of the same features on the raman phononic spectra . besides its remarkable success in explaining the existing experimental data in graphene - based systems , the present theoretical approach offers a general scheme for the microscopic understanding of fano - like features in a wide variety of other systems . </S>"
