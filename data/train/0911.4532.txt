    "the number of discovered extrasolar planets has been increasing quickly since the first extrasolar planet , 51 pegasi b , was detected around a solar - type star @xcite .",
    "51 pegasi b is the prototype of a class of exoplanets known as  hot jupiters \" because they are generally jupiter - mass planets located @xmath8 au from their parent stars and therefore their equilibrium temperatures are much higher than that of jupiter .",
    "the high temperature of the protoplanetary disk at the orbital radii where they are now provides an environment extremely different from where giant planets are expected to form via either the core - accretion model @xcite or the gravitational instability model @xcite .",
    "one of the most commonly adopted solutions is that hot jupiters have formed at larger orbital radii in the protoplanetary disk and then moved inward to their current locations via the disk - planet interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetic fields of classical t tauri stars ( hereafter ctts ) are typically strong enough to truncate the inner regions of protoplanetary disks to the corotation radius , where the keplerian angular velocity of the disk is the same as the stellar - spin angular velocity , and create an inner magnetospheric cavity .",
    "besides , the migration due to the planet - disk interaction is expected to slow dramatically once a young hot jupiter passes the inner disk edge @xcite . the pile - up population of hot jupiters at @xmath9 au from their solar - type parent stars revealed from radial - velocity searches @xcite may be attributed to the existence of the cavity ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "on one hand , an attempt has been made by @xcite to search for a hot jupiter around a ctts , although @xcite substituted an explanation of a cool stellar spot for an orbiting hot jupiter .",
    "future observations will provide more evidence for planets of early ages . on the other hand ,",
    "the simulated orbital evolution of giant planets as they migrate into the cavity was carried out by @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that high - mass hot jupiters would move closer to their central stars and even be destroyed because planet s entry into the magnetospheric cavity results in a growth in orbital eccentricity @xmath10 .",
    "although the eccentricity excitation is subject to the uncertain properties such as disk mass and viscosity , this model may provide a mechanism to pump up the eccentricity of a hot jupiter inside the cavity and in turn affect the orbital evolution of the planet via the tidal interactions between the star and planet .",
    "in addition , the magnetic interactions between the star and planet in the magnetospheric cavity would be important as well , which may be an upscale analogy to the magnetic interactions between jupiter and the galilean satellites ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the coupled tidal evolution of the radius and orbit of hot jupiters in the absence of a disk has been investigated @xcite . to obtain noticeable influence on @xmath11 ,",
    "the tidal heating is assumed to be deposited deep in the planet in these models @xcite .",
    "the purpose of @xcite and @xcite is to explain the large radii of some transiting hot jupiters using tidal heating . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that for modest eccentricities , young hot jupiters of radius @xmath12 jupiter radii at @xmath13 au swell beyond two jupiter radii and their internal degeneracy is partially lifted on the timescale of @xmath14 gyrs . ] .",
    "thereafter , their thermal equilibria become unstable and they undergo runaway inflation until their radii exceed the roche radius .",
    "then roche lobe overflow ensues . under the assumption that the overflowing gas immediately loses its orbital angular momentum to the planet and plunges into the central star ,",
    "these mass - losing planets migrate outwards , such that their semi - major axes and roche radii increase while their mass , eccentricity , and tidal dissipation rate decrease until the mass loss is quenched . of course , including a disk would change the orbital evolutions of roche - lobe - overflowing planets , as has been calculated by @xcite who do not consider the tidal expansion of @xmath11 and the magnetospheric cavity though .    as more and more hot jupiters located @xmath15 au",
    "have been discovered by transit surveys for recent years , it is noteworthy that almost no giant planets of mass @xmath5 jupiter mass ( @xmath16 ) have been detected within @xmath17 au from their solar - type parent stars ( see figure [ correl ] ; also see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this puzzle may be attributed to the subsequent evolutions of hot jupiters after they enter the magnetospheric cavity of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "since thermal evaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has not been undoubtedly identified to be the major cause ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , we shall discuss the potential implication of our model to explain the observation in the end of the paper .",
    "for the above reasons , in this work we concentrate on the orbital evolution of a young hot jupiter inside the magnetospheric cavity of a protoplanetary disk by taking into account the tidal and magnetic interactions between the star and planet .",
    "to restrict to the problem without significantly involving the planet - disk interaction for simplicity , we consider the evolution after the hot jupiter enters the 2:1 orbital resonance with the inner edge of a disk .",
    "the initial eccentricity , which is expected to be excited in the cavity before the planet migrates to the resonance location , is treated as one of the free parameters of the problem .",
    "the equations for the orbital and interior evolution of a hot jupiter inside a magnetospheric cavity are described in  2 .",
    "the results are presented in  3 , and are summarized and discussed in  4 .",
    "figure [ model ] illustrates our toy model that shows a hot jupiter orbiting a ctts in a magnetospheric cavity of a protoplanetary disk .",
    "the magnetic dipole fields of a protostar truncate the inner part of the protoplanetary disk at the disk radius @xmath18 , which is the radius of the cavity .",
    "the initial orbit of the planet is set to lie at the 2:1 orbital resonance with the inner edge of the disk , which allows us to ignore the tidal interactions between the disk and the planet @xcite .",
    "the semi - major axis @xmath19 of this resonant orbit is denoted as @xmath20 . however , when the inner edge of the disk extends inwards for any reasons in our model such that @xmath21 , the planet is artificially moved inwards as well to maintain the 2:1 orbital resonance with the inner edge of the disk .",
    "moreover , we assume that there is no magnetic linkage between the disk and the planet as illustrated in figure [ model ] and therefore neglect magnetic interactions between them .",
    "in other words , the planet s orbit evolves due to tidal and magnetic interactions with the central star , whereas the star interacts with both the planet and the disk .",
    "therefore , this section consists of two parts , namely the magnetic and tidal effects , to describe the model in detail .  2.1 and  2.2 describe the star - disk and star - planet magnetic interactions , which leads to disk locking and contributes to the orbital evolution of the planet , respectively .",
    " 2.3 and  2.4 then describe the tidal interactions between the ctts and the planet .",
    "the circularization of the planet s orbit is due to tides on both the planet and the star .",
    "the thermal inflation of the planet is due to tides on the planet excited by the star .",
    "on the other hand , the tides on the star raised by the planet affect the evolution of the planet s orbit and the stellar spin .",
    "finally , we summarize the key formulae for our model in  2.5 .      there have been a number of models for the star - disk interactions to account for the rotation of cttss as well as star and jet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the closed field lines connecting from the protostar to the disk to allow for funnel accretion , the open field lines may diverge primarily from the inner edge of the disk ( i.e. x - wind model , see * ? ? ? * ) or emanate largely from the star and the disk ( i.e. stellar and disk wind model , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , the stellar field topology may be in the complex form of multipole @xcite or tilted dipole relative to the stellar spin @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we ignore these complications and adopt the simple non - tilted dipole configuration of stellar fields that thread through the protoplanetary disk as has been illustrated in figure [ model ] .",
    "to calculate the magnetic torque @xmath22 on the star due to the magnetic linkage to the disk , we adopt the approach by @xcite in which the magnetic torque acting on an annulus of the disk is due to the azimuthal twisted field lines @xmath23 caused by the difference between the stellar spin and the orbital motion of the annulus @xcite .",
    "hence , the torques integrated from the disk inner edge at @xmath18 to infinity contribute to the net magnetic torque between the star and the disk : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the stellar dipole moment , @xmath26 is the magnetic field strength at the stellar surface , @xmath27 is the stellar radius , @xmath28 is the corotation radius , @xmath29 is the stellar spin rate , and @xmath30 is the stellar mass .",
    "we employ the same scaling law as used in @xcite to specify the strength of stellar magnetic field : @xmath31 where the scaling factor @xmath32 is a constant indicative of the surface magnetic strength for the stellar spin period of 4 days .",
    "the magnetospheric radius @xmath18 is determined by the balance between the stellar magnetic stress and the disk reynolds stress ( starczewski et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the disk accretion rate and @xmath35 is a dimensionless factor of order unity . for a star with an aligned dipole field , @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , the mass transfer rate throughout the disk is assumed to be comparable to an observational inferred accretion rate from protostellar disks onto cttss , which decays with time @xmath37 over the timescale @xmath38 years and can be fitted by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the earth mass ( ida & lin 2004 ) .",
    "the equation for the spin evolution of the protostar is then given by @xmath41 in the above equation , @xmath42 is the moment inertia of the ccts and @xmath43 is the net torque arising from the presence of the disk , where @xmath44 is the torque spinning up the star due to the disk accretion :    @xmath45    with @xmath46 being the keplerian angular speed at the radius @xmath18 @xcite . @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath42 are obtained from the interior structure of the contracting ctts modeled by @xcite , who modified the eggleton code @xcite for the pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "when the star rotates faster than the inner edge of the disk ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , the mass accreting onto the star should be ceased by the centrifugal force and @xmath44 is therefore set to be zero in our model . meanwhile , the star experiences immediate magnetic braking as a result of its strong fields , leading to disk locking of the stellar spin .",
    "disk locking makes the star and the inner disk edge corotate again and resumes the accretion .",
    "therefore precisely speaking , the disk density near the inner edge of the disk , @xmath18 , and @xmath48 should fluctuate with time . in practice , we have simply employed equations ( [ eq : r_mdisk ] ) and ( [ eq : mdot ] ) to implement the disk properties rather than modelling the detailed disk structure near @xmath18 .",
    "this is certainly a limitation of our model . with regard to the overall disk accretion rate , as we shall see in",
    " 3 , the fluctuation of the balance between the mass accretion and the magnetic braking ( i.e. disk locking ) is rather fast compared to the timescales of interest , meaning that equation  ( [ eq : mdot ] ) is a proper approximation to describe the average mass accretion rate in our problem .",
    "the torque on the planet due to magnetic linkage to the star is modelled as the magnetic stress ( @xmath49 ) multiplied by the cross - sectional area of the planet s magnetosphere and the distance @xmath50 between the planet and its parent star .",
    "it is assumed that the planet has a magnetosphere in which the gas behaves like plasma .",
    "in addition , the magnetosphere is assumed to be as large as the planet s size , so the area of the planet interacting with the stellar field is @xmath51 . applying the star - disk magnetic interaction described in  2.1 to the star - planet case , we obtain the magnetic torque on the planet @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the orbital angular velocity . the magnetic torque changes with the distance between the planet and the central star while the planet moves in an eccentric orbit ,",
    "so we employ the mean torque over one orbit period @xmath54 .",
    "that is , @xmath55 to carry out the above integral , we make the approximation that the orbit does not vary significantly during one orbital period ; i.e. , the orbital angular velocity @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath19 is the semi - major axis , @xmath10 is the eccentricity , and @xmath58 is the mean motion of the mutual orbit of the planet and the star .",
    "then after integrating and being divided by @xmath54 , equation ( [ equation3 ] ) gives an expression for the mean magnetic torque on the planet : @xmath59 .",
    "\\label{eq : t_planet}\\ ] ] here , we have introduced a coefficient @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , to regulate the magnetic torque on the planet , a formulism similar to that applied to the magnetic torques between the galilean satellites and jupiter ( zarka 2007 ) . in this regard ,",
    "the energy dissipation associated with the magnetic torque can be generally considered as the poynting flux at the magnetopause scaled by @xmath60 .",
    "hence , @xmath62 corresponds to the upper limit of the magnetic torque .",
    "the planet is assumed to have zero obliquity and zero orbital inclination .",
    "the gravitational tides on the planet affect the evolution of the eccentricity and the spin of the planet .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we do not consider the influence of the planet - star magnetic interactions on the spin and eccentricity of the planet .",
    "therefore , the rate of the eccentricity change of the orbit is due solely to gravitational tides on the planet and the star .",
    "the rate contributed from the tidal dissipation in the planet alone is given by @xmath63 , which can be obtained from ( mardling & lin 2002 ) @xmath64 ,   \\label{eq : tidalfrict}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 for the tidal dissipation in the star is also shown and will be considered in  2.4 . in the above equation , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the tidal quality factors of the star and the planet , respectively .",
    "all the uncertainties associated with the physical processes of tidal heating are contained in the @xmath70 values . for a fiducial value",
    ", it has been suggested that the @xmath71 values inferred for jupiter from io s orbital evolution is @xmath72 ( yoder & peale 1981 ) . with this @xmath71 value , orbits of planets with @xmath73 and @xmath11 comparable to those of jupiter and with a period less than a week ,",
    "are circularized within the main - sequence life span of solar - type stars .",
    "@xmath68 has been inferred to be @xmath74 for the very young binary stars",
    "since the synchronous timescale of the planet is much shorter than the circularization timescale @xcite , we simply assume that the planet s spin equals the orbital rotation throughout the evolution .",
    "this assumption may be invalid during the phase of the roche - lobe overflow if the orbit changes dramatically due to quick mass loss ( see eq .",
    "( [ equation18 ] ) below ) , causing a large discrepancy between the planet spin and orbital motion .",
    "this means that the tidal heating due to synchronization is unrealistically ignored during this special phase in our model .",
    "moreover , the tidal process of orbital circularization shrinks the planet s orbit ; i.e. , @xmath75 during the orbital circularization , there is substantial tidal heating within the planet .",
    "the tidal heating of the planet may have contributed significantly to the thermal budget that governs the planet s physical properties , including its radius @xcite .    ignoring the rotation energy of the planet ,",
    "we can write the first law of the thermodynamics for a tidally heated planet as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the tidal heating rate ( see mardling & lin 2002 for the expression ) , @xmath78 is the intrinsic luminosity from the photosphere of the planet , @xmath79 is the internal energy , and @xmath80 is the gravitational potential energy .",
    "suppose that @xmath81 and @xmath82 with the coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 depending on the interior structure of the planet .",
    "then in the absence of mass loss ( i.e. @xmath85 ) , the above energy equation gives rise to the expansion / contraction rate of the planet ( cf .",
    "* ) : @xmath86 even though the expanding / contracting planet is not in the thermal equilibrium , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath78 can be simply expressed in terms of functions of @xmath11 and @xmath73 as long as the timescales under consideration are @xmath87 the convective turnover time for an almost convective planet with the same solid - core mass and a thin radiative envelope of the same opacity ( i.e. an almost polytropic interior , see gu et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) . in our approach ,",
    "the core mass of the planet is assumed to be @xmath88 , which is motivated by the core accretion model for the formation of giant planets ( pollack et al .",
    "however , the thermal properties of the core are not modelled in our work .",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are obtained only from certain different @xmath73 by fitting to the numerical data for the interior structures of tidally inflated jupiters described in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , their values and derivatives with respect to @xmath11 for any desired @xmath73 can be interpolated from these available fitted functions .",
    "once the planet s radius exceeds its roche radius @xmath92 ( see the appendix ) , the mass loss ensues . during the planet overflow phase , the @xmath11 adjustment after losing mass plays an important role in determining the subsequent evolution .",
    "@xmath11 changes with @xmath73 as well according to the equation of state of the planet even though the entropy of the planet does not change .",
    "since the interpolated data derived from our interior structure code is unable to deal with the processes that are as quick as the adiabatic mass loss , we adopt the following simple methodology . assuming a polytropic structure of a planet",
    ", the adiabatic mass - radius exponent @xmath93 can be estimated from the polytropic index of the planet @xcite .",
    "@xmath94 can then be related to the gravitational potential energy .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath95 .",
    "for simplicity we shall use this relation to estimate @xmath94 from @xmath84 for a roche - lobe filled planet , albeit these polytropic relations are derived for an isolated gravitationally bound body .",
    "therefore , the complete expression of @xmath96 in the presence of the mass loss through the lagrangian 1 ( l1 ) point should read @xmath97 where we shall adopt the formalism in @xcite to estimate @xmath98 ( see  2.5 for the detail ) . in the case of a giant planet with large radius such as a young hot jupiter",
    ", @xmath94 is always negative .",
    "in addition , @xmath99 increases with @xmath11 , because the planet degeneracy is being lifted when its density goes down @xcite .",
    "similar to the physical condition for the formation of the magnetospheric cavity of the disk , planet s overflow may either form a ring / disk or funnel along the stellar field lines onto the ctts depending on whether @xmath98 is strong enough to dominate over the stellar fields . therefore , we modify equation ( [ eq : r_mdisk ] ) by replacing @xmath48 with @xmath98 to define the  overflow cavity radius @xmath100 \" where the reynolds stress of the overflowing gas is comparable to the magnetic stress of the stellar fields . thus ,",
    "if this radius is larger than planet s semi - major axis , where the overflow occurs , the overflowing gas will flow through the magnetic field to the central star .",
    "the stellar spin will speed up under the action of the torque from planet s overflow , @xmath101 , which is an analogy to the spin - up torque due to the disk accretion described in equation ( [ equation17 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the evolution of the stellar spin caused by the planet s overflow : @xmath102 on the other hand , if the overflow cavity radius is smaller than the semi - major axis , the overflowing gas will form a ring / disk around the star instead of directly funnelling along the field lines onto the star . in this stage , we assume that the total angular momentum of the overflowing gas is immediately transferred to the orbit of the planet , leading to the outward migration of the mass - losing planet : @xmath103 and therefore no spin - up torque is exerted on the star .",
    "the above equation for outward migration suggests that the mass - losing planet can be detached from its roche lobe as long as @xmath11 does not expand as fast as @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to examine the linear stability of a roche - lobe filled planet against mass loss .",
    "the definition of @xmath92 from the appendix and equation ( [ eq : a_outward ] ) give @xmath104 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rdot ] ) then indicates that the expansion rate of @xmath11 is @xmath105 provided that the thermal adjustment of @xmath11 is less important than the adjustment of @xmath11 due to the adiabatic mass loss . once the planet s photosphere reaches the roche radius ( i.e. @xmath106 ) , the above analysis infers that the mass loss of a roche - lobe filled planet is linearly unstable ( i.e. undergoes exponential growth ) if @xmath107 .",
    "in addition to the tides on the planet induced by the star , the planet also raises the tides on the star to circularize the orbit and to lock the rotation of the star .",
    "the circularization rate described in the preceding subsection has to be complemented by the tidal dissipation in the star ; namely , @xmath108 where @xmath65 has been displayed in equation ( [ eq : tidalfrict ] ) .",
    "the process of the tidal locking of the ctts leads to the exchange of the angular momentum between the planet s orbit and stellar spin .",
    "the stellar spin is assumed to be normal to the orbital plane of the planet and the disk .",

    "the migration evolutions of the planets with same masses will differ as a result of different initial eccentricities .",
    "the distance , over which the planet can migrate inward from the initial position , is shortest when @xmath145 and increases as @xmath146 increases .",
    "this is because firstly , the circularization of a eccentric orbit makes the orbit shrink .",
    "secondly , the inflation of a planet due to tidal heating enhances the star - planet magnetic interaction . also , the tidal torque on the star caused by the planet is more significant as @xmath146 is larger .",
    "all of the above factors accelerate the migration rate of the planet .",
    "when @xmath146 @xmath147 the critical eccentricity @xmath148 , the planet s radius will exceed its roche lobe and start to lose mass onto the central star .",
    "we perform the calculations for three cases of @xmath146 : ( 1 ) @xmath145 ; ( 2 ) @xmath149 ; ( 3 ) @xmath150 for each planet mass .",
    "the orbital evolutions are shown in figure [ bigcavity ] and the explanations are presented below .    in the case of @xmath145 ( solid lines in the figure ) ,",
    "the results for different masses are not significantly difference . without an eccentric orbit to bring the planet closer to the central star ( i.e. the perihelion ) ,",
    "the tidal and magnetic effects are excited less effectively in a large distance between the planet and the central star .",
    "hence , planets with different masses initially in circular orbits migrate to almost the same final positions , @xmath151 au at @xmath152 yr , as the cavities contract and drive the planets to the 2:1 resonances .",
    "when @xmath149 ( dotted lines in the figure ) , the planets start to overflow their l1 points and lose mass .",
    "as shown in the figure , their evolutions are terminated before the end of the simulations ( @xmath152 years ) , suggesting that all of the planets are disrupted .",
    "the termination of the simulations occurs when the discrepancy between @xmath11 and @xmath92 is so large during the overflow phase that @xmath153 is too large to be resolved in the simulation with the time step @xmath154 years .",
    "this time step of 100 years is already shorter than the time step used for the interpolated data derived from our interior structure code . when the runaway solutions happen , @xmath99 is always larger than 5/3 , which is in agreement with the linear instability of the mass loss . for the @xmath155 and @xmath136 cases ,",
    "the mass loss rate is high .",
    "the overflow gas is able to form a ring / disk and hence the planet migrates outward according to equation ( [ eq : a_outward ] ) in our model .",
    "however , once their overflows occur , @xmath156 at the same time owing to their large @xmath11 .",
    "the radius adjustment is predominated by the adiabatic mass loss instead of tidal inflation , leading to the runaway solutions to the odes . on the other hand for the @xmath135 and @xmath134 cases , they migrate fast to the locations closer to the central stars owing to the stronger tides raised by these massive planets on their central stars . in addition , these more massive planets are more difficult to inflate by tidal heating due to their higher gravitational binding energies and cooling rates @xcite . hence ,",
    "when they overflow their roche lobes , @xmath11 is not too large and therefore @xmath157 , leading to the stable overflow .",
    "although the overflowing gas initially funnels to the central star , the overflow rate becomes substantially high shortly such that @xmath158 .",
    "consequently the massive planets have undergone outward migration almost since the overflow began .",
    "the outward migration is primarily driven by inward migration due to the tidal and magnetic interactions rather than tidal inflation .",
    "the overflow finally turns to be unstable when @xmath99 increases to 5/3 as @xmath19 and therefore @xmath11 increases .",
    "the evolution then stops and the planet loses all its gas to the central star . during the phase of the fast outward migration , the planet s spin may become unlocked with its orbital motion . despite not being included in our model , the tidal heating associated with the asynchronism would speed up the planet inflation and lead to the same catastrophic fate of the planet . comparing these cases for different initial @xmath73 , massive planets require higher @xmath148 thus more tidal heating to be inflated against their greater gravitational binding energies and cooling rates .",
    "@xmath159 requires @xmath160 and destructs at @xmath161 au , while @xmath162 needs @xmath163 and destructs at @xmath164 au .",
    "now we turn to the case for @xmath150 ( i.e. @xmath146 is slightly smaller than @xmath148 ) to study the conditions in which the planet of a given mass can migrate inward the farthest and still survive in the end of the simulation .",
    "as can be expected from the previous results for @xmath149 , the dashed curves in the figure show that a more massive planet undergoes faster migration due to the stronger tidal torque .",
    "thus , the planet with @xmath159 and @xmath165 can arrive at @xmath166 au , while the planet of @xmath167 and 1 @xmath16 can not migrate to the region @xmath168 au .",
    "furthermore , a low mass planet is more easily inflated by tidal heating , giving rise to the relatively stronger magnetic interaction ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_planet ] ) ) .",
    "this explains why the planet of @xmath169 migrates slightly farther in than the planet of @xmath136 in the end of the simulation . in equaiton ( [ eq : t_planet ] ) , the coefficient @xmath60 regulates the magnetic torque on the planet , and the upper limit @xmath62 has been applied to obtain the above results . here",
    ", we employ @xmath170 to study the orbital evolutions in the absence of the magnetic torque . in comparison to the previous orbital evolutions",
    "shown in figure [ bigcavity ] , figure [ eps0 ] shows the lower migration rates because of the lack of the star - planet magnetic interaction for the @xmath1710.7 , 1 , and 1.5@xmath16 cases .",
    "however , the stellar tides induced by the @xmath134 planet are far dominant over the magnetic interaction , so the massive planet still migrates to @xmath172 au .",
    "that position is even farther inward than @xmath166 au for the @xmath62 case as the planet with even higher @xmath173 can still survive in the absence of the magnetic torque .",
    "moreover , figure [ eps0 ] confirms the previous subtle result about the dependence of the magnetic torque on @xmath11 : the slightly more inward migration of the planet of @xmath137 than @xmath136 does not reappear because these exists no magnetic torque to speed up inward migration for a lighter planet of a larger inflated radius . as to the cases for @xmath149 ,",
    "the simulated planets overflow their roche radii and perish in the same way as in the @xmath62 cases ; namely , @xmath99 of various cases finally is @xmath174 and the mass loss becomes runaway . for the cases of @xmath137 , @xmath136 , and @xmath135 , @xmath156",
    "once their overflow occurs . on the other hand , after reaching the roche lobe , the planet of @xmath134 migrates outward for a period of time due to stable overflow and inward migration driven by the tidal torque .",
    "it is finally destroyed due to the large @xmath99 that increases with @xmath11 as the mass - losing planet moves outwards .",
    "the weaker stellar fields due to the smaller scaling factor @xmath131 g form a smaller magnetospheric cavity , so the initial position of the planet is much closer to the central star ; namely , @xmath175 au . the planet and the star exert remarkable tidal forces on each other in such short distances , and the magnetic torque on the planet is not negligible as well .",
    "@xmath92 is getting smaller while the planet migrates inwards .",
    "as soon as @xmath176 , the overflow occurs , leading to the destruction .",
    "consequently , even @xmath145 ( i.e. , no tidal heating in the planet ) , all the planets destruct irrespective of their mass . if @xmath73 is bigger , the migration is faster due to the stronger tidal torque .",
    "therefore , the more massive the planet is , the quicker the planet destructs , as shown in figure [ eps0sc ] for @xmath62 .",
    "the orbital evolutions of the the @xmath136 and @xmath134 cases are characterized by the alternating out / inward orbital migrations .",
    "once the overflow occurs , the large expansion of @xmath92 due to the high mass loss rate dominates over the adiabatic inflation , hence leading to the fast outward migration . as a result , @xmath11 temporarily detaches from @xmath92 for a while until the planet moves in and the next roche overflow occurs again . finally , the planet will lose all its mass when the overflow occurs accompanied with high @xmath99 ( i.e. @xmath174 ) .    in the absence of the magnetic torque ( i.e. @xmath170 ) , the tides raised by massive planets on the stars still drive significant inward migration of the planets .",
    "figure [ eps0sc ] shows that shutting down the magnetic torque can not change the outcome of planet destruction for @xmath177 .",
    "however , the planet of @xmath169 can survive in @xmath4 years because the inward migration driven by the weak tidal torque from the low mass planet is slow",
    ". therefore , we estimate @xmath178 for the planet to perish and show the evolution in the leftmost panel of figure [ eps0sc ] .",
    "we construct a simple model to study the orbital evolution of a young hot jupiter in an eccentric orbit inside a magnetospheric cavity of a proto - planetary disk around a ctts . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the magnetospheric cavity of the protoplanetary disk is truncated by a stellar dipole field . through the magnetic linkage between the central star and the disk , the rotational period of the star is quickly locked by the inner edge of disk .",
    "we then introduce a young hot jupiter at @xmath20 and restrict ourselves to the orbital evolution of a hot jupiter inside the cavity . assuming that the planet behaves like a plasma",
    ", we apply the same formulism for the star - disk magnetic interaction to that for the star - planet interactions .",
    "we adopt the equilibrium - tide equations with @xmath179 and @xmath180 to model the star - planet tidal interactions . in so doing ,",
    "our model focuses on the planet migration due to tidal and magnetic interactions between the planet and the star , and does not consider any interactions between the planet and the disk .",
    "however , as the size of the magnetospheric cavity evolves , the planet is artificially pushed to @xmath20 if it lies beyond @xmath20 .",
    "we vary three parameters @xmath32 ( @xmath181 and 1500 g ) , initial @xmath73 ( @xmath182 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 @xmath16 ) , and initial @xmath10 ( @xmath145 , @xmath183 , and @xmath148 ) in our simulations to investigate the fate of the planet migration under the influence of the cavity size , planet mass , and orbital eccentricity .",
    "two sizes of magnetospheric cavities are considered to approximately match the bimodal distribution of spin periods of young stars in the orion nebula cluster .",
    "the initial @xmath20 corresponding to the large ( small ) cavity opened up by the stronger ( weaker ) stellar fields is @xmath184 au ( @xmath185 au ) . in the case of the large cavity ( @xmath130 g ) ,",
    "the planets require nonzero @xmath146 to enhance their tidal and magnetic interactions with their central stars and make significant inward migration . the migration rate increases with @xmath146 for a given planet mass .",
    "when @xmath146 is as large as the critical value @xmath148 , @xmath11 exceeds @xmath92 and the roche overflow occurs . for planets with different masses , massive planets ( @xmath186 )",
    "have higher @xmath148 ( i.e. more intense tidal heating ) than less massive ones ( @xmath187 ) because massive planets are more difficult to thermally inflate due to their greater gravitational binding energies and cooling rates . as a result , stronger stellar tides raised by the planet with higher @xmath73 and @xmath146 allow for faster migration .",
    "overall , massive planets can therefore migrate further in than less massive ones , as shown in the simulations for @xmath150 .",
    "when @xmath149 , low - mass planets ( @xmath167 and 1 @xmath16 ) inflate by tidal heating faster than inward migration .",
    "hence they overflow their large roche lobes at large @xmath19 , resulting in the low density and therefore the runaway mass loss . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - mass planets ( @xmath188 and 2 @xmath16 ) migrate inwards fast without significant tidal inflation .",
    "in contrast to the low - mass planets , once these planets fill their small roche lobe at small @xmath19 , their density is high enough that they can undergo stable l1 overflow . during this phase ,",
    "tidal and magnetic interactions instead of tidal inflation drive them to lose mass , expand , and migrate outward .",
    "this stable mass - loss phase proceeds until these outward migrating planets are large enough to become unstable against mass loss .",
    "finally , they lose all gas to their central stars . in the case of the small cavity ( @xmath131 g ) ,",
    "the simulated planets in circular orbits all quickly migrate in due to the fierce tidal and magnetic interactions until they stably overflow their roche radii .",
    "after that , they can move outwards due to the mass loss and move inwards again by the tidal and magnetic torques . as their mass goes down and",
    "their degeneracy is lifted , all of these planets are finally destroyed , suffering from the runaway mass loss as in the large - cavity case .    to study the significance of the magnetic interactions between the star and the planet in our model , we also simulate the cases by shutting down the interaction ( i.e. @xmath170 ) .",
    "we found that the migration of less massive planets is more sensitive to the magnetic interaction , which is enhanced by their easily inflated radii .",
    "setting @xmath170 makes the migration rate of low - mass planets slower , as shown in the case for @xmath189 with @xmath190 in the large - cavity case .",
    "by contrast , the inward migration of massive planets is less sensitive to the magnetic interaction but more to the tidal interaction . as has been summarized in the preceding paragraph , all planets in the small cavity destruct under both the tidal and magnetic torques at such close - in initial positions from the stars even if @xmath145 . when @xmath170 , only the planet of @xmath137 can survive unless the low - mass planet starts with an eccentric orbit with @xmath178 .",
    "the model presented here for the orbital evolution of young hot jupiters is different from the works by @xcite and @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we employ simple models including the star - planet interactions and disk locking , which are not considered by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we take into account the planet expansion due to the adiabatic mass loss and model the mass loss rate using the approach in @xcite , whereas @xcite ignore the radius adjustment to the mass loss and use a free parameter to control the mass loss rate . ignoring the mass - radius relation during the roche - lobe overflow phase as done in @xcite ,",
    "a roche - lobe filled giant planet with @xmath149 continuously loses its mass via tidal inflation and migrates outwards until the tidal heating rate is weaker than the cooling rate , leading to a survived planet of lower mass . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite consider young hot jupiters moving inwards via the type ii migration without a magnetospheric cavity and tidal inflation . in their work",
    "including the mass - radius relation , once the planets of mass @xmath191 get close enough to their central stars and therefore overflow their roche lobes , they migrate outwards and finally lose all their mass onto the star . in this",
    "regard , our results are compatible with theirs .",
    "one of the major differences is that the mass loss is driven by the type ii migration in the model by @xcite , while in our work the mass loss is driven by the loss of orbital angular momentum via the tidal and magnetic interactions with the parent star whose spin is almost locked by the disk .",
    "moreover , the planets of mass @xmath192 with @xmath193 survive in the cavity during the ctts phase in our model .    for the last few years , transit surveys have revealed the peculiar @xmath194 correlation for hot jupiters : less massive hot jupiters ( @xmath195 jupiter mass ) are almost absent within @xmath196 au from their parent dwarf stars of the ages @xmath14 gyrs .",
    "our results show that during the ctts phase , planets of @xmath197 with modest initial eccentricities ( @xmath198 ) and sufficient magnetic interactions in a large cavity can migrate to @xmath199 au , while planets of @xmath200 can not .",
    "more specifically , given @xmath193 , the planet of @xmath134 can safely arrive at @xmath201 au and the planet of @xmath135 can get to @xmath202 au in the end of our simulations .",
    "whether or not these planets can further migrate toward their spun - down parent stars during the main - sequence phase depends on @xmath68 , which is not yet well understood .",
    "@xcite suggested that @xmath68 induced by hot jupiters may become large ( i.e. @xmath203 ) as cttss evolve to main - sequence stars based on their dynamical - tide model .",
    "as they and others @xcite pointed out , we would be extremely fortunate to observe these very close - in hot jupiters if the current @xmath204 , implying that @xmath68 of the solar - type main - sequence host stars may be quite large .",
    "however , it should be noted that these very close - in planets were all discovered by transit surveys ( see figure [ correl ] ) .",
    "although transit surveys overall prefer to detect close - in planets @xcite , the detectability of a hot jupiter as a function of the semi - major axis of interest here ( i.e. @xmath205 au ) is extremely ill - defined as the various transit surveys are subject to different observational limitations such as the transit depth , sampling rate , red noise , and detection threshold @xcite . if @xmath68 indeed gradually becomes @xmath203 as cttss evolve to main - sequence stars , therefore allowing the planets to move a little bit inward during the short transition after @xmath152 years while halting the further planet migration for most of the main - sequence phase , our model may have the potential to explain the absence of low - mass hot jupiters within @xmath206 au . on the other hand ,",
    "a large body of studies have suggested that @xmath207 associated with the tidal dissipation induced by the hot jupiters in main - sequence dwarfs could be as small as @xmath129 . as a result of the efficient tidal dissipation",
    ", the orbits of the hot jupiters can decay so significantly that the planets may plunge into their host stars during the main - sequence phase @xcite .",
    "this  accretion \" model may account for the paucity of the extremely close - in hot jupiters concluded from radial - velocity surveys ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see figure [ correl ] ) .",
    "in addition , the relatively young ages of the extremely close - in hot jupiters revealed by transit surveys may also lend support to the model @xcite .",
    "although the planet - metallicity correlation independent of the spectral type does not seem to favor the accretion model @xcite , excessive heavy elements in the shallow convection zone of high - mass dwarfs may be able to sink down to the radiative zone via the double diffusive effect , thereby eliminating the metallicity enhancement and resolving the problem for the model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found an excess spin of the host stars of hot jupiters , which may arise from tidal spin - up , although the uncertainty of the stellar ages and the limitation of a small number of samples demand more detections in the future to confirm the conclusion .",
    "the study by @xcite for the accretion model is carried out based only on one - mass case ( i.e. @xmath136 ) .",
    "if the accretion model is the main cause responsible for the observed @xmath194 relation , it would be expected that the extremely close - in giant planets of mass @xmath208 of younger ages should also be detected by transit surveys .",
    "the orbital decay timescale during the main - sequence phase due only to the tidal dissipation is given by @xmath209 ( see equation([eq : j*dot ] ) ) .",
    "in the case of a planet of 0.7@xmath210 , the planet can survive in @xmath211 yrs from the distance of @xmath196au at @xmath212 myrs .",
    "in contrast , the orbit of a planet of @xmath213 will decay on the timescale of @xmath214 yrs from a distance of @xmath215au at @xmath212 myrs .",
    "in other words , during the main - sequence phase , less massive planets excite weaker tides on their parent stars and therefore still stay outside @xmath216 au , while the massive planets keep falling into the stars in the way as interpreted by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the exact values of the roche radius in units of @xmath19 are calculated using the equations in @xcite and are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] for various mass ratios and eccentricities relevant to our problem .",
    "the table shows that the roche radius at perihelion is larger than that at aphelion in some of the cases .",
    "it is because the planet orbits faster ( slower ) than the  fictitious \" circular motion performed at perihelion ( aphelion ) . as a result ,",
    "the centrifugal force due to the orbital motion is larger ( smaller ) at perihelion ( aphelion ) than the centrifugal force of the fictitious circular motion at the point , therefore enlarging ( reducing ) the roche radius relative to the  roche radius \" associated with the circular motion .",
    "furthermore , the above analysis is based on the assumption that the spin of the planet is instantaneously synchronized with the orbit at any moment @xcite .",
    "while it is true for a synchronized circular orbit , in an eccentric orbit the planet s spin is normally  synchronized \" with its orbital motion close to perihelion where the tidal forcing is expected to be near its maximum @xcite .",
    "following the same line of the above argument , a  synchronized \" planet spins faster than its orbit at aphelion , implying that the roche radius is smaller than the value associated with the circular motion at the point .",
    "it should be noted that equation ( [ eq : m_dot ] ) for the mass loss rate is also derived for a circular orbit .",

    "<S> we present a simplified model to study the orbital evolution of a young hot jupiter inside the magnetospheric cavity of a proto - planetary disk . </S>",
    "<S> the model takes into account the disk locking of stellar spin as well as the tidal and magnetic interactions between the star and the planet . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the orbital evolution starting from the orbit in the 2:1 resonance with the inner edge of the disk , followed by the inward and then outward orbital migration driven by the tidal and magnetic torques as well as the roche - lobe overflow of the tidally inflated planet . </S>",
    "<S> the goal in this paper is to study how the orbital evolution inside the magnetospheric cavity depends on the cavity size , planet mass , and orbital eccentricity . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we only target the mass range from 0.7 to 2 jupiter masses . in the case of the large cavity corresponding to the rotational period @xmath0 days </S>",
    "<S> , the planet of mass @xmath1 jupiter mass with moderate initial eccentricities ( @xmath2 ) can move to the region @xmath3 au from its central star in @xmath4 years , while the planet of mass @xmath5 jupiter mass can not . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the critical eccentricity beyond which the planet of a given mass will overflow its roche radius and finally lose all of its gas onto the star due to runaway mass loss . in the case of the small cavity corresponding to the rotational period @xmath6 days , </S>",
    "<S> all of the simulated planets lose all of their gas even in circular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the orbital evolution of young hot jupiters may have the potential to explain the absence of low - mass giant planets inside @xmath7 au from their dwarf stars revealed by transit surveys . </S>"
