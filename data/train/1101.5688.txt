    "proteins behave as both generating @xcite and sensing @xcite elements for the membrane curvature @xcite .",

    "it has also been shown that bending rigidity and membrane thickness affect protein functioning @xcite .",
    "proteins affect membrane curvature through various ways such as scaffold and local curvature mechanisms , and by their integration ( as transmembrane proteins ) with the membrane @xcite . however , the experimental measurements of variations in the membrane curvature are not easy .",
    "the role of proteins on the membrane deformations has been studied using continuum elastic modeling @xcite , particle - based @xcite and mesoscopic @xcite simulations , and hybrid elastic - discrete particle models @xcite . in all these studies ,",

    "lipids can spontaneously aggregate and form various membranes @xcite .",
    "when lipid chains are assembled in the form of a closed 3d surface and trap water molecules , a vesicle is generated .",
    "entropy is the main driving mechanism of this process @xcite . to construct vesicles",
    ", we insert initially flat rectangular lipid bilayers ( which may contain proteins ) inside a box of water molecules .",
    "such a configuration is unstable because the tails of boundary lipids are repelled by water molecules and the bilayer is compressed by in - plane forces .",

    "we have studied the phenomena of protein clustering and membrane shape transformation during membrane vesiculation and afterwards . comparing relaxed vesicles and",
