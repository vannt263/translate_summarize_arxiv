    "garside groups were introduced by p. dehornoy and l. paris in  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "they are groups that satisfy the same kind of properties that were shown to hold in artin s braid groups @xmath8 in the foundational paper of f. garside  @xcite , and soon afterwards in spherical artin - tits groups by brieskorn and saito  @xcite . more precisely , they are groups admitting a lattice structure , invariant under left multiplication , and satisfying some additional conditions .",
    "the focus of this paper and of its companions @xcite and @xcite is on gaining an improved understanding of the known algorithmic solutions in garside groups of the _ conjugacy decision problem _ ( cdp ) , that is , to decide , for arbitrary @xmath9 whether there exists @xmath6 such that @xmath10 ; and also the _ conjugacy search problem _ ( csp ) , that is , to find @xmath6 as above when @xmath1 and @xmath5 are known to be conjugate .    in the manuscript @xcite",
    "the second author of this paper introduced a complete invariant of the conjugacy class of an arbitrary element @xmath1 in an arbitrary garside group @xmath2 , which is a certain finite set of elements , called the ` ultra summit set ' @xmath0 ( definition [ d : uss ] . ) for arbitrary @xmath9 either @xmath11 ( in which case @xmath1 is conjugate to @xmath5 ) or @xmath12 . from this",
    "it follows that in order to determine whether @xmath1 and @xmath5 are conjugate , one must compute the entire set @xmath0 and a single element in @xmath13 .",
    "that leads one immediately to ask about bounds on the number of elements in @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is a first step toward answering that question .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the structure of @xmath0 , a matter which we isolated as being a key issue as we worked toward a polynomial algorithm for the cdp / csp in @xmath14 .",
    "see @xmath151.4 of @xcite for an outline of our approach to that problem , and a discussion of how the work in this paper fits into that program and the open problems that remain .    here is a brief overview of the contents of this paper . in @xmath15[ss : basic facts ] we give a quick review of the necessary background , with all essential defintions . in @xmath15[s : the structure of the uss ] we will describe new properties of the structure of ultra summit sets , showing that in order to compute them one only needs to apply two special kinds of conjugation , which we call ` partial cycling ' and ` partial twisted decycling ' ( definition [ d : partial cycling ] ) . using it , we discover new aspects of the combinatorics that are both closely related to things we already understand well , but at the same time present new challenges .",
    "we will study the graph @xmath7 which describes @xmath0 of an element @xmath16 , a garside group , and prove that @xmath7 splits into two subgraphs , which we call ` black ' and ` grey ' .",
    "the similarities and differences between the graphs @xmath7 and @xmath17 are particularly interesting . in @xmath152",
    "we also give several key examples which illustrate our new discoveries .    in @xmath15[s :",
    "rigid elements ] and @xmath15[s : periodic elements ] we examine the effects of partial cycling on two special kinds of elements in a garside group @xmath2 : rigid elements and periodic elements . in this",
    "regard we note that , while the work in this paper is applicable to all garside groups and no assumptions are made that restrict attention to the braid groups @xmath14 , the reader who is familiar with the thurston - nielsen trichotomy ( see @xmath151.3 of @xcite ) in braid groups and with the main result in @xcite will recognize that rigid elements and periodic elements have particular importance in the case of braids .",
    "this is relevant for the program that we outlined in @xmath151.4 of @xcite for studying the cdp / csp in the braid groups .",
    "the final section , @xmath15[s : applications ] is devoted to applications .",
    "the first application , in @xmath15[ss : complexity of the cdp / csp for pa and periodic braids ] , is to show how our new knowledge of the structure of @xmath0 in @xmath15[s : rigid elements ] and @xmath15[s : periodic elements ] advances our efforts to find a polynomial solution to the cdp / csp in the special case of the braid groups .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to find a bound for the number of elements in @xmath0 in this paper , even when we restrict to rigid elements .",
    "finding such a bound is open question 2 of @xmath151.4 of @xcite , and remains for future work .",
    "examples are given in @xmath15[ss : complexity of the cdp / csp for pa and periodic braids ] that illustrate the remaining difficulties .",
    "such examples would have been impossible to understand without the work in this paper .",
    "we then discuss the periodic case , briefly . a polynomial solution to the cdp / csp for periodic braids",
    "will be given in the next paper in this series , @xcite .",
    "the second application , in @xmath15[ss : a new solution to cdp / csp in garside groups ] is to develop a new solution to the cdp / csp in arbitrary garside groups . this new algorithm is faster than the one in  @xcite , although its theoretical complexity is essentially the same .",
    "the third application , in @xmath15[ss : partial cycling subsumes decyling ] is to show that , in a sense , partial cycling subsumes cycling .",
    "this is probably more of theoretical interest than of interest for complexity .",
    "the final application , in @xmath15[ss : an application to the theory of reductive groups ] , is a brief note to mention that , as was communicated to us by jean michel , our work on the structure of the @xmath0 of a periodic element has implications for the theory of reductive groups .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details",
    ".      our review of what we need from the literature will be brief .",

    "there is a special type of conjugation that has been recognized , ever since the work of elrifai and morton in @xcite , to be of fundamental importance in the combinatorics that underlie all of our work :    [ d : cycling , decycling ] if @xmath60 and has left normal form as in ( [ e : left normal form ] ) , then _ cycling _ @xmath61 and _ decycling _ @xmath62 are the special conjugates of @xmath1 that are defined by : @xmath63 the _ twisted decycling _ of @xmath1 is defined by @xmath64 .",
    "twisted decycling will be important later . to see how cycling and decycling enter into the picture , recall that the _ super summit set _",

    "it is known that @xmath65 is always non - empty and finite .",
    "see corollary 1.11 of @xcite and the discussion that follows it for a description of how cycling and decycling enable one , for any @xmath16 , to compute at least one element @xmath70 .",
    "however , we will not be working with @xmath65 in this paper .",
    "instead , we consider a subset of @xmath65 which was introduced by the second author of this paper in  @xcite .",
    "[ d : uss ] the _ ultra summit set _",
    "@xmath0 of an element @xmath16 is the subset of elements @xmath71 such that @xmath72 , for some @xmath73 .",

    "to state the theorem that we will use from  @xcite , we need one more concept :    [ d : gamma_x ] given @xmath16 , there is a directed graph , @xmath7 , which describes the entire set @xmath0 , is defined by the following data :    each vertex represents an element @xmath3 .    for every @xmath3 and every minimal simple element @xmath81 for @xmath5 with respect to @xmath0",

    "the algorithm in  @xcite computes the graph @xmath7 using the following ` convexity theorem ' , which is analogous to a related convexity theorem proved for super summit sets in @xcite .",

    "notice that the set of minimal simple elements for @xmath5 is contained in @xmath91 , hence the number of minimal simple elements for @xmath5 is bounded by the number of atoms . in the case of @xmath14 , with its classical garside structure , there are @xmath92 atoms , so in @xmath7 there are at most @xmath92 arrows starting at a given vertex .",
    "we remark that one obtains an element in @xmath0 by iterated application of cycling to an element in @xmath65 .",
    "the number of times one needs to apply cycling , in order to go from an element in @xmath65 to an element in @xmath0 is not known in general .",

    "later in this paper , in @xmath15[ss : a new solution to cdp / csp in garside groups ] , we will obtain yet another algorithm which is faster than the one in @xcite , although its theoretical complexity is unchanged .",
    "the conjugating elements involved in cycling or decycling will play a crucial role in our work ( as they did in @xcite ) , so to avoid repeated references to the automorphism @xmath50 we introduce convenient shorthand :    [ d : iota_varphi ] given @xmath16 whose left normal form is @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , we define the _ initial factor _ of @xmath1 as @xmath95 , and the _ final factor _ of @xmath1 as @xmath96 . if @xmath97 we define @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    "( iii ) @xmath107 and @xmath109 .",
    "the third condition implies that @xmath1 is rigid if and only if @xmath58 is rigid .",
    "it is important to notice that the assumption @xmath107 implies that @xmath110 and its powers are _ not _ rigid .",
    "[ r : t - n ] we need one more set of ideas from the existing literature before we can begin our new work . in @xmath15[ss : complexity of the cdp / csp for pa and periodic braids ] we will specialize our work about garside groups to the braid groups @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , all of our examples will be taken from braid groups .",
    "it therefore is important to keep in mind that the braid group @xmath14 acts on the @xmath111-times punctured disc @xmath112 , and that this action determines a faithful representation of @xmath14 as the _ mapping class group _ of @xmath112 , that is , the group @xmath113 .",
    "the reason this is important is that , as a consequence , the well - known _ thurston - nielsen trichotomy _ ,",
    "introduced by thurston in @xcite applies : braids come in three flavors : pseudo - anosov ( or pa ) , periodic and reducible .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the foundational paper in this area and to @xcite for a very brief description of the trichotomy .",
    "we will not discuss it here because we use it in a very peripheral way : to identify our examples as being pa or periodic .",
    "we note , however , that in  @xcite the authors of this paper proved the important fact that every pa braid in its @xmath114 has a ` small ' rigid power , so that all results about rigid elements in garside groups apply ipso - facto to powers of pa braids . a major part of the work in this paper , notably the work in @xmath15[s : rigid elements ] concerns rigid elements in garside groups .",

    "the structure of @xmath7 which we described in the previous section , will be seen in this section to be particularly simple in the case of rigid elements .",
    "this is important for the following reasons :    it was proved in theorems 3.21 and 3.22 of @xcite that a wide class of elements in garside groups have rigid powers .",

    "this allows us to study the conjugacy problem for pa braids , using the properties of rigid elements .    as noted earlier , the ultra summit set of a rigid element in a garside group often exhibits a transparently simple structure similar to the one seen in example  [ e : a ] , that is , the cycling orbits have length @xmath471 or @xmath472 and the number of orbits is 2 or 1 . however , there are examples of braids ( and thus of elements in garside groups ) whose ultra summit set is bigger than expected .",

    "recall also that @xmath728 preserves the colors of the arrows , hence the arrows in @xmath957 also have a well - defined color ( black or grey ) .",
    "we can then draw the quotient graphs @xmath956 to have an idea how the distinct orbits are connected in the graph @xmath7 .",

    "<S> this paper is the second in a series ( the others are @xcite and @xcite ) in which the authors study the conjugacy decision problem ( cdp ) and the conjugacy search problem ( csp ) in garside groups .    the ultra summit set @xmath0 of an element @xmath1 in a garside group @xmath2 is a finite set of elements in @xmath2 , introduced in  @xcite , which is a complete invariant of the conjugacy class of @xmath1 in @xmath2 . a fundamental question , if one wishes to find bounds on the size of @xmath0 , is to understand its structure . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two new operations on elements @xmath3 , called ` partial cycling ' and ` partial twisted decycling ' ( definition [ d : partial cycling ] ) , and prove that if @xmath4 , then @xmath5 and @xmath6 are related by sequences of partial cyclings and partial twisted decyclings . </S>",
    "<S> these operations are a concrete way to understand the minimal simple elements which result from the convexity theorem in @xcite . using partial cycling and partial twisted decycling </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the structure of a directed graph @xmath7 which is determined by @xmath0 , and show that @xmath7 can be decomposed into ` black ' and ` grey ' subgraphs . </S>",
    "<S> there are applications which relate to the program outlined in @xcite for finding a polynomial solution to the cdp / csp in the case of braids . </S>",
    "<S> a different application is to give a new algorithm for solving the cdp / csp in garside groups which is faster than all other known algorithms , even though its theoretical complexity is the same as that of the algorithm in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also applications to the theory of reductive groups . </S>"
