    "cuprate superconductors are separated into two groups : the hole - doped and electron - doped cuprate superconductors @xcite , respectively .",
    "this follows a fact that the undoped parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are known to be a mott insulator with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order ( aflro ) @xcite .",
    "however , this aflro is destructed quickly by doping holes or electrons , and then superconductivity emerges leaving the af short - range order ( afsro ) correlation still intact @xcite .",
    "therefore the persistence of spin excitations is apparently universal in both hole- and electron - doped cuprate superconductors @xcite . immediately following the discovery of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors",
    ", it has been realized that the spin excitations may serve as the pairing glue @xcite . in this case , the understanding what survives of the spin excitations in the doped regime is crucially important for the understanding of the emergence of superconductivity .    the early inelastic neutron scattering ( ins )",
    "measurements have demonstrated that the spin excitation of the undoped parent compounds is well described by spin - wave theory @xcite . however , when holes are doped , the low - energy spin excitation changes substantially and has an hour - glass - shaped dispersion in the superconducting ( sc ) state @xcite , where two incommensurate ( ic ) components of the low - energy spin excitation spectrum are separated by a commensurate resonance energy @xmath0 at the waist of the hour glass .",
    "in particular , in analogy to the dome - shaped doping dependence of the sc transition temperature @xmath1 , this commensurate resonance energy @xmath0 increases with increasing doping in the underdoped regime , and reaches a maximum around the optimal doping , then decreases in the overdoped regime .",
    "however , very recently , the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) experimental observations @xcite indicate that although the spectral distribution of the high - energy spin excitations broadens upon hole doping , it keeps its energy position almost unchanged , i.e. , it follows rather closely the spin excitation dispersion of the parent compound , reflecting a fact that the high - energy spin excitation is a remnant mode of the parent compound and then the spin dynamics has strongly localized nature .    on the electron - doped side , although the low - energy spin excitation spectrum in the upward component , above @xmath0 , is the similar that in the hole - doped case , the low - energy ic magnetic scattering below @xmath0 and inward dispersion toward a resonance peak with increasing energy appeared in the hole - doped case are not observed @xcite .",
    "however , as in the hole - doped case @xcite , @xmath0 in the electron - doped side still scales with the sc gap forming a universal plot @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent rixs experimental data show that the spin excitations of the parent compound shift to higher energy upon electron doping over a wide momentum space , and the spin excitations have the unusually large hardening of the dispersion , indicating that the spin excitations in the electron - doped side more deeply couple to the charge carriers @xcite .",
    "although the similarities and differences of the spin excitation spectrum between the electron- and hole - doped cuprate superconductors from low - energy to high - energy have been observed from the ins and rixs experiments @xcite , the full understanding of their similarities and differences is still a challenging issue .",
    "theoretically , there is a general consensus that the unusual dynamical spin response is generated by the scattering of spins due to the charge - carrier fluctuations .",
    "several attempts have been made to make these arguments more precise @xcite .",
    "the dynamical spin response is manifested itself by the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath2 . in our early discussions of the origin of the low - energy commensurate resonance in the electron - doped cuprate superconductors",
    ", @xmath2 was calculated in terms of the collective charge - carrier mode in the particle - particle channel only , and then the low - energy commensurate resonance has been identified as a nature consequence of the creation of the charge - carrier pairs @xcite . however ,",
    "an obvious weakness is that the contribution of the collective charge - carrier mode in the particle - hole channel to the spin dynamics is not considered , and therefore the formalism in ref .",
    "can not be used directly to discuss the dynamical spin response in the normal - state .",
    "moreover , although this contribution of the collective charge - carrier mode in the particle - hole channel to the spin dynamics is not related with the low - energy commensurate resonance , it contributes to the low - energy ic spin fluctuations and high - energy spin excitation spectrum . in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamical spin response of the electron - doped cuprate superconductors in both the sc- and normal - states by including the contributions of the collective modes in the particle - particle and particle - hole channels . as a complement of the our previous analysis of the nature of the low - energy commensurate resonance in the sc - state @xcite",
    ", we first discuss the low - energy behavior of the dynamical spin response , and then confirm that the low - energy commensurate resonance energy correlates with the dome - shaped doping dependence of the charge - carrier pair gap .",
    "however , the high - energy spin excitations bear a striking resemblance to those obtained in the corresponding normal - state , indicating that the high - energy spin excitations are unlikely to be a major factor in the pairing interaction .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic formalism is presented in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] , where we generalize the calculation of the dynamical spin structure factor in ref .",
    "@xcite by including the contributions of the collective modes in both the particle - particle and particle - hole channels . within this theoretical framework",

    "however , the low - energy ic spin fluctuations can persist into the normal - state .",
    "finally , we give a summary and discussions in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we start from the @xmath3-@xmath4 model on a square lattice , which is the simplest model capturing the essential physics of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "this @xmath3-@xmath4 model describes a competition between the kinetic energy and magnetic energy , where the magnetic energy with the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spin - spin antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange @xmath4 favors the magnetic order for spins and results in frustration of the kinetic energy , while the kinetic energy generally includes the electron nn hopping @xmath3 and next nn hopping @xmath5 , and therefore it favors delocalization of charge carriers and tends to destroy the magnetic order . in this paper ,",
    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "when necessary to compare with the experimental data , we take @xmath8 mev @xcite . as in the hole - doped case @xcite ,",
    "the electron - doped @xmath3-@xmath4 model is also very difficult to analyze , analytically as well as numerically , because of the restriction of the motion of electrons in the restricted hilbert space without zero electron occupancy .",
    "however , this restriction of no zero occupancy can be treated properly within the framework of the fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the spin fluctuations occur in the charge - carrier quasiparticle background , and then the spin configuration in the @xmath3-@xmath4 model is strongly rearranged due to the effect of the charge - carrier hopping on spins .",
    "the poles of the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath2 in eq .",

    "[ sc - high - energy ] , we plot @xmath2 as a function of energy along the @xmath76 $ ] to @xmath77 $ ] direction of bz at @xmath78 , @xmath72 , @xmath56 , and @xmath79 with @xmath54 .",
    "apparently , the main feature of the high - energy spin excitations in the electron - doped cuprate superconductors @xcite is qualitatively reproduced , where the peak width of the spin excitation broaden upon electron doping .",
    "in particular , the spectral weight around @xmath80 $ ] moves to higher energy with the increase of electron doping .",
    "this high - energy shift and broadness of the spin excitations around @xmath80 $ ] upon electron doping are consistent with the experimental observations @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] , we plot the spin excitation dispersion along the high symmetry directions of bz at @xmath56 with @xmath54 to summarize our main results of the dynamical spin response of the electron - doped cuprate superconductors in the sc - state from low - energy to high - energy . for comparison , the schematic summary of the spin excitation dispersion of the electron - doped cuprate superconductors obtained by rixs and ins measurements @xcite is also shown in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] ( inset ) .",
    "it is thus shown that the spin excitations in the electron - doped cuprate superconductors are well defined at all momenta , however , as in the hole - doped case , the low - energy spin excitations depend sensitively on electron doping and momentum , while the electron doping has a more modest effect on the high - energy spin excitations .     with @xmath54 for @xmath6 and @xmath81 .",

    "( [ dssf ] ) is reduced to the case in the normal - state , where the spin self - energy is obtained in terms of the collective charge - carrier mode in the particle - hole channel _ only_. to show how the spin excitations evolve with temperature from the sc - state to the normal - state , we firstly plot the positions of the low - energy magnetic scattering peaks around @xmath61 $ ] as a function of momentum at @xmath56 with @xmath84 in fig .

    "since the height of the magnetic scattering peak is determined by damping , the ic magnetic scattering peak broadens and weakens in amplitude as the energy increase .    to analyze the evolution of the high - energy spin excitations with momentum and doping in the normal - state , we have performed a calculation of the normal - state @xmath2 at the different doping levels with the temperature well above the corresponding @xmath1 , and the result of the normal - state @xmath2 as a function of energy along the @xmath76 $ ] to @xmath85 $ ] direction of bz at @xmath78 with @xmath54 , @xmath72 with @xmath86 , @xmath56 with @xmath84 , and @xmath79 with @xmath87",

    "[ sc - high - energy ] for the same set of parameters except for the temperature above @xmath1 , we therefore find that these normal - state high - energy spin excitations , in their spectral weights and shapes of the magnetic scattering peaks , are striking similar to those in the corresponding sc - state , also in qualitative agreement with the experimental result @xcite .",
    "these results in fig .",
    "[ sc - high - energy ] and fig .",
    "[ ns - high - energy ] also indicate that the high - energy spin excitations do not correlate with the pairing interaction , and then the low - energy spin excitations are dominant mediating glue for the pairing in the framework of the kinetic - energy - driven superconductivity .",
    "the essential physics of the spin dynamics in the electron - doped cuprate superconductors is the same as in the hole - doped case except for the electron - hole asymmetry . in the @xmath3-@xmath4 model ,",
    "the nn hopping @xmath3 has a particle - hole symmetry because the sign of @xmath3 can be absorbed by the change of the sign of the orbital on one sublattice , however , the particle - hole asymmetry is described by the next nn hopping @xmath5 .",
    "although there are the similar strengths of the af exchange coupling @xmath4 , nn hopping @xmath3 , and next nn hopping @xmath5 for both the hole- and electron - doped cuprate superconductors , the interplay of @xmath5 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 causes a further reduction of the magnetic correlations in the hole - doped case , while increase of the af spin fluctuations in the electron - doped side @xcite , i.e. , the af spin fluctuations in the electron - doped side are stronger than that in the hole - doped case , leading that the spin excitations in the electron - doped cuprate superconductors more deeply couple to the charge carriers . in this case , the hot spots are located much closer to the zone diagonal @xcite , and then the charge - carrier pair gap has a nonmonotonic d - wave gap form ( [ gap ] ) as mentioned above , which induces a broad commensurate magnetic scattering at low energies in the sc - state @xcite , and therefore is different from the hole - doped case @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the spin self - energy @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ ssf ] ) is obtained by including the contributions of the collective modes in both the particle - particle and particle - hole channels . however , as we @xcite have shown in the hole - doped case that the charge - carrier quasiparticle spectrum has an effective band width @xmath89 .",
    "this is also true in the electron - doped side , and then the spin self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ ssf ] ) strongly renormalizes the spin excitations at energies below @xmath90 , but has a weak effect on the spin excitations at energies above @xmath90 .",
    "this is why the dispersion of the spin excitations at energies below @xmath90 are strongly reorganized by electron doping , while the high - energy spin excitations are insensitive to electron doping .",
    "furthermore , as in the hole - doped case @xcite , the charge - carrier quasiparticle contribution to the spin self - energy renormalization in eq .",
    "( [ ssf ] ) is separated as two parts @xmath19 and @xmath27 , respectively .",

    "in summary , within the framework of the kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism , we have studied the momentum and doping dependence of the dynamical spin response in the electron - doped cuprate superconductors .",
