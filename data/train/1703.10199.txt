    "lvy flights @xcite and lvy walks @xcite are two well known stochastic models of anomalous diffusion . generally speaking , lvy flights correspond to markovian motions whose individual , uncorrelated random steps are drawn from a lvy distribution , thus extending brownian motion for which the step lengths are gaussian",
    ". a resulting asymptotic lvy diffusion is then characterized by infinite variance , indicating that the width of the diffusive `` packet '' must be understood in terms of some fractional moments or the interquartile distance @xcite .",
    "this mathematical property of lvy flights along with their instantaneous propagation are considered in many situations unphysical .",
    "in contrast , in lvy walks @xcite , the meandering particle has a finite velocity , so that long jumps take proportionally longer time .",
    "still , in the absence of any boundary effect , the core of the lvy walk packet .",
    "this means that under free boundary conditions lvy flights can serve as a good approximation to the lvy walk , although with an improper prediction of the moments of the jump length distribution @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze these two popular models of stochastic motion in bounded domains .",
    "such motions can e.g. represent foraging behaviors of animals and bacteria @xcite , the spreading of diseases @xcite or particle transport along soft polymer chains @xcite .",
    "the problem we aim to address is whether both aforementioned approaches yield similar results in terms of investigated kinetics ( survival , occupation and first passage times ) and long - term behavior ( existence of stationary states and stationary probability densities ) .",
    "depending on the value of the stability index @xmath0 and used characteristics we find similarities but also large deviations between the two models .",
    "we furthermore compare explicit analytical results with numerical simulations of stochastic dynamics .",
