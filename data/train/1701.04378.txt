    "continuous quantum thermal devices are quantum systems connected to several baths at different temperatures and to work sources @xcite .",
    "their operation is necessarily irreversible when the heat currents are non - negligible .",
    "one of the possible irreversible processes is the ubiquitous finite - rate heat transfer effect considered in endoreversible models . in these models",
    "the control parameters can be tunned to reach the reversible limit but at vanishing energy flows .",
    "examples are the three - level and the two - qubit absorption refrigerators @xcite . in other models , as the power - driven three - level maser @xcite and the three - qubit absorption refrigerators @xcite , additional irreversible processes appear such as heat leaks and internal dissipation @xcite , which are detrimental to the device performance .",
    "several experimental realizations of these continuous quantum thermal devices have been proposed , for example nano - mechanical oscillators or atoms interacting with optical resonators @xcite , atoms interacting with nonequilibrium electromagnetic fields @xcite , superconducting quantum interference devices @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite . besides , the coupling between artificial atoms and harmonic oscillators is experimentally feasible nowadays @xcite , opening the perspective of connecting thermal devices to environments through quantum systems .",
    "although the most general design of a quantum thermal network is composed of thermal devices and wires @xcite , the device performance has been usually analyzed assuming a direct contact with the environments .",
    "the coupling between the device and a quantum probe has been suggested to characterize the device irreversible processes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt a different perspective and study the additional irreversible processes induced by the coupling between the device and the wire .",
    "in particular we will analyze in detail the performance of a system composed of a three - level device and a two - level wire connected to a work bath or source .",
    "when the system is weakly coupled to the baths , its evolution is described by a quantum master equation in which the dynamics of the populations can be decoupled from the coherences choosing an appropriate basis @xcite .",
    "this property implies the positivity of the entropy production along the system evolution @xcite , and is broken when some uncontrolled approximations are considered in the derivation of the quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "the pauli master equation for the populations ( in the following simply the master equation ) is a particular example of the general master equations considered in stochastic thermodynamics for systems connected to multiple reservoirs @xcite . for long enough time",
    ", the system reaches a non - equilibrium steady state where the heat currents @xmath0 describe the energy transfer between the system and the baths , and the power @xmath1 characterizes the energy exchange with the work source @xcite .",
    "although the heat currents can be obtained directly from the steady solution of the master equation , to identify the different irreversible processes contributing to them is in general a very complicated task .",
    "an alternative approach to analyze non - equilibrium processes is the decomposition of the steady state fluxes and the entropy production in the contribution due to simple circuits @xcite , fundamental circuits @xcite or cycles @xcite of the graph representation of the master equation .",
    "we will consider a decomposition in the full set of simple circuits that combined with the all minors matrix - tree theorem @xcite lead to very simple expressions for the steady state heat currents .",
    "more importantly , each circuit can be interpreted as a thermodynamically consistent unit and its contribution to the different irreversible processes can be easily identified @xcite . although the number of circuits may be very large , we will show that the system performance can be described by means of a reduced number of circuit representatives @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : theory ] presents a brief review of the derivation of the quantum master equation for a device coupled to a heat bath through a quantum wire .",
    "next the graph representation of the master equation and the decomposition in simple circuits is discussed , with special emphasis on the characterization of the steady state heat currents . some procedures to determine the set of simple circuits",
    "are described in appendix a. the absorption refrigerator composed of a three - level device connected to a work bath through a two - level wire is studied in section [ sec : bathsource ] and some circuit representatives are suggested to describe the system performance . the same analysis is applied to a system driven by a periodic classical field in section [ sec : worksource ] , which includes a brief discussion of the derivation of the master equation for the time dependent hamiltonian . in this case",
    "we study the performance operating as a refrigerator or as an engine . finally , we draw our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a system composed of a quantum thermal device with hamiltonian @xmath2 directly coupled with a cold bath and a hot bath , at temperatures @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and a quantum wire with hamiltonian @xmath5 which connects the device to an additional bath at temperature @xmath6 ( work bath ) .",
    "the situation in which the system is driven instead by a work source will be discussed in section [ sec : worksource ] .",

    "we assume that the coupling terms of the system with the baths are @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a device or wire hermitian operator , @xmath14 is a bath operator and @xmath15 characterizes the coupling strength .",
    "if the system is weakly coupled with the baths and its relaxation time scale is slow compared with the correlation times of the baths , the system evolution can be described by a markovian quantum master equation for its reduced density operator @xmath16 .",
    "the procedure to obtain this quantum master equation is described for example in @xcite .",
    "here we just comment on the final result .",
    "let @xmath17 denotes the evolution operator corresponding to the system hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "the essential elements in the quantum master equation can be identified from the following decomposition of the operators @xmath13 in interaction picture    @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the summation over the positive transition frequencies @xmath21 between eigenstates of @xmath22 .",

    "the steady state heat current between the system and a bath associated with a simple circuit is    @xmath73    and the steady state entropy production is given by @xmath74 . at this point",
    "it is important to notice that although the affinity and the flux are defined for each cycle , the steady state heat currents and entropy production are independent of the cycle orientation and can then be assigned to the circuit without any ambiguity . besides each circuit is consistent with the first and second law of thermodynamics as @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "finally the heat currents and the entropy production in the steady state can be obtained by adding the contribution of all the simple circuits of the graph , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    the relative importance of the contribution due to a simple circuit to the heat current ( [ eq : circuitcurrent ] ) is determined by both its affinity @xmath79 and flux @xmath80 ( [ eq : cycleflux ] ) .",
    "when the system is coupled with thermal baths , the circuits can be classified as trivial circuits ( all the affinities @xmath81 ) , circuits associated with heat leaks ( one of the affinities is zero ) and tricycles ( the three affinities are different from zero ) @xcite .",
    "trivial circuits do not contribute to the steady state heat currents or entropy production .",
    "circuits associated with heat leaks only connect two baths , and the heat always flows from the higher to the lower temperature bath .",

    "this approximation can be further improved by including a larger number of circuits .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the irreversible processes in a three - level thermal device coupled with a two - level wire connecting the system to a work bath .",
    "the coupling induces heat leaks and internal dissipation that prevents the system to reach the reversible limit . besides , if the detuning between the transitions of the three - level device and the two - level wire is too large , the system stops working as an absorption refrigerator as the heat leaks dominate .",
    "we found similar results in the analysis of systems in which the wire connects either the cold or the hot bath .",
    "the additional irreversible mechanisms are proportional to the coupling constant between the device and the wire .",

    "the system performance can be well described by just considering two circuit representatives .",
    "this description may be improved incorporating additional circuits and renormalizing their contribution to the heat currents @xcite .",
    "our results can be generalized to wires composed of a chain of two - level systems .",
    "the graph representation of the master equation will have a larger number of vertices and edges , exponentially increasing the number of simple circuits .",
    "however , the graph topological structure will be similar . for example",
    "let us consider a chain of @xmath273 two - level systems connecting the device with a classical periodic field .",
    "the corresponding graph resembles the one in figure [ fig : figure1](c ) , with @xmath274 states connected to @xmath275 states by two edges associated with the cold and the hot baths . again the most important contribution to the heat currents comes from the @xmath276 two - edge circuits .",
    "now the transition rates will depend on the frequencies @xmath277 and the affinities @xmath161 of circuits associated with heat leaks will be proportional to @xmath278 . in general the function @xmath278 , and therefore the frequency interval subjected to internal dissipation , increases with @xmath273 .",
    "however , for coupling constants @xmath106 and @xmath193 small enough , the heat leaks can be neglected .",
    "this same analysis applies when the system is coupled with a work bath .",
    "the only limitation in both cases is that @xmath106 must be much larger than the coupling constants with the bath @xmath15 for the master equation to be valid .",
    "the irreversible processes analyzed are the result of the new decay channels due to the additional coupling term .",
    "therefore they are expected in any quantum device connected through quantum wires to the environments . to avoid them",
