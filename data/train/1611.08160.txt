    "in a recent work we considered the problem of the correlation energy of the quantized electron gas based upon methods , results , and reasonings of classical statistical mechanics @xcite . with this development the well known rpa of quantized system was recovered as a basic result for the correlation energy .",
    "as already known , rpa results deviate clearly from available monte carlo data @xcite .",
    "since the rpa is a basic results also from the viewpoint and methods of liquid state theory for classical fluids , the problem will be how to utilize these methods to improve the rpa in the quantum case . in our previous work we focused upon conditions on the pair correlation function .",
    "these must reflect the fact that fermions with equal spins are not allowed to be at the same position .",
    "for classical systems the repulsive coulomb interaction will also prevent particles to be at the same position .",
    "these conditions can be applied to the equal time correlation function to improve results .",
    "the first condition is exact while the second turns out not to be so in the quantum mechanical case , especially for increasing energy .",
    "for this reason , in ref .",
    "@xcite the second condition had to be abandoned with some increase of uncertainty in the results .",
    "our method to improve upon the rpa rests on the introduction of an effective interaction . in the correlation function of the rpa the pair interaction plays a role similar to the direct correlation function for classical systems .",
    "it is then known that for a pair of particles at large separation @xmath1 , the direct correlation function approaches the interaction times inverse temperature with minus sign . for smaller separations there will be deviations .",
    "but they should change smoothly for interactions that vary likewise .",
    "one then expects the effective interaction to behave in a similar way . with this the fermion condition",
    "was used to determine a free parameter in the function describing these deviations .",
    "this function may be a yukawa term ( shielded coulomb ) or something related whose range can be determined from the given condition .    in the present work we will focus upon thermodynamic self - consistency .",
    "therefore , the core condition with its uncertainty for unequal spins mentioned above , will not be imposed .",
    "self - consistency in our system has its analog for classical systems in the scoza ( self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ) and hrt ( hierarchical reference theory ) for classical systems @xcite .",
    "they both require thermodynamic self - consistency between compressibility relation and internal energy or the similar type of integral resulting from change in free energy by a small change in pair interaction .",
    "with scoza the strength of the effective interaction is tuned by changing the effective temperature , while with hrt the effective interaction is built ( and subsequently modified ) by gradually including its wave vectors in fourier space ( renormalization ) .",
    "both scoza and hrt turned out to give very accurate results , also in the challenging critical region @xcite .    in the context of the electron gas correlation energy problem , in ref .",
    "@xcite the alda ( adiabatic local density approximation ) , among other approximations was considered . there",
    "the compressibility was used to determine a parameter in an effective interaction . however , in the alda formulation , this reduces to the addition of a constant to the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this constant corresponds to adding a @xmath2-function in @xmath1-space .",
    "then the free energy is obtained by integrating the energy - type charging integral .",
    "the result obtained clearly over - compensates the inaccuracy of the rpa @xcite .    the main problem with alda , as we see it , lies in its use of the @xmath2-function .",
    "a more smooth cut - off of the coulomb interaction is needed as mentioned above .",
    "the adequacy of this assumption was already tested in ref .",
    "[ it may be mentioned that for an interaction of finite range , the scoza and hrt simply multiply it with an adjustable constant .",
    "this , however , is not suitable for the @xmath3 interaction due to its crucial tail for large @xmath4 that should be kept unmodified .",
    "so in this work we will investigate how the use of self - consistency with a smooth cut - off can actually improve the rpa and alda results , while retaining the conceptual simplicity of the liquid - state approach explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the compressibility relation for the quantized electron gas will be established .",
    "also explicit expressions for the reference system correlation function ( non - interacting coulomb gas ) and its rpa form are written down .",
    "it is verified that the reference system correlation function when used in the compressibility relation , reproduces the known equation of state for free fermions .",
    "further for interacting fermions the correction to the reference system equation of state can be expressed via the compressibility relation in terms of a cut - off parameter @xmath5 in the resulting effective interaction .",
    "this simplifies the situation .",
    "the alda also evaluates this parameter @xmath5 from compressibility based known results .",
    "then by computation of the correlation energy it is found that the inaccuracy of the rpa is over - compensated such that significant improvements of results are not obtained with alda @xcite . to us",
    "this inaccuracy is due to the crude approximation of including a constant in fourier space or a @xmath2-function in @xmath1-space in the effective interaction . to improve upon this situation",
    "we will use @xmath5 as a cut - off parameter in smooth effective interactions and then study variations and accuracy of results .    in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the compressibility with exchange energy only , is considered , and its influence upon the correlation function is written down .",
    "it is then found that the exchange energy included alone gives the very simple result @xmath6 .    then in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] the influence of the correlation energy is taken into account . since",
    "the correlation energy is a correction to the exchange energy , it turns out that the former has small influence upon the parameter @xmath5 ; it decreases a small amount .",
    "this change will again modify the correlation energy to modify @xmath5 a bit further .",
    "but this modification will be so small compared with other uncertainties that we simply neglect it .",
    "also the precise relation of consistency between free energy and compressibility can be expressed through a differential equation as in scoza and hrt @xcite .",
    "but with the small change in @xmath5 all this can be disregarded , and we have a much simplified consistency problem . with the small influence of the correlation energy upon the @xmath5 we can simplify further by just using the correlation energy from fitted simulations to obtain @xmath5 .",
    "thus in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] the `` exact '' correlation energy , fitted from simulations , is expressed in terms of an analytic expression from which compressibility and thus the parameter @xmath5 is easily obtained by differentiation .    in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] thermodynamic self - consistency between adiabatic charging and compressibility is considered",
    ". then an average value of @xmath5 is used in various smooth effective interactions to see the accuracy by which various cutoff functions reproduce the simulation results . from this the correlation function and the wave vector dependence of contributions to the free energy are also obtained . by including another free parameter",
    "the exact free energy is relatively easy to recover .",
    "its wave vector dependence , which we also evaluate , is a more strict test on the form of the effective interaction of the uniform electron gas .    our numerical results for the correlation energy ( including its wave vector dependence )",
    "are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] and compared with the well known perdew - wang parameterization @xcite of the ceperley and alder monte carlo results @xcite .",
    "we will see how a single parameter fit of the correlation energy reproduces its wave vector dependence over the entire range of electron densities .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec8 ] .    finally in sec .",
    "[ app ] appendix it is shown that for the coulomb gas the quantum mechanical virial theorem is fully consistent with the charging principle .",
    "the compressibility relation is valid for quantized fluids as it is for classical fluids .",
    "so , if one considers the free fermion gas , the number of particles is given by eq .",
    "( i15 ) as ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 here and below the numeral i will be used to designate equations of ref .",

    "the tilde denotes fourier transform in space with variable @xmath35 while the hat also includes fourier transform in imaginary time with variable @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath46 @xmath47 as given by eqs .",
    "( i5 ) , ( i9 ) , ( i13 ) , ( i16 ) , and ( i17 ) .",

    "however , the electron gas is neutralized by a neutralizing background that cancels the mean field term @xmath59 ( small charges @xmath60 of high density @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus with pressure @xmath62 we end up with the compressibility relation ( @xmath63 ) @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath48 given by eqs .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) respectively . for small @xmath66",

    "helmholtz free energy per unit volume is then @xmath70 since @xmath71 .",

    "the exchange energy is the dominating contribution to the interaction energy at high density .",
    "thus @xmath77 is the high density value while for finite densities there will be higher order corrections to this value .",
    "altogether we will find that @xmath5 has small variations consistent with numerical results obtained in ref .",
    "for the electron gas of uniform density accurate results for the correlation energy have been obtained from simulations @xcite .",
    "thus these results which may be considered exact , can be utilized to obtain values for the parameter @xmath5 in a rather straightforward way . for general use",
    "it is preferable to express the correlation helmholtz energy per particle @xmath78 as @xmath79 inserting numerical values with use of eqs .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) , and ( [ 30 ] ) one finds eq .",
    "( i20 ) for the fermi energy @xmath80    we will need first and second derivatives of @xmath81 , so it will be advantageous to fit it with an analytic expression . here",
    "it should be noted that if the coulomb interaction is scaled with a parameter @xmath33 ( @xmath82 ) , i.e. @xmath83 , the function @xmath81 will scale to become @xmath84 with @xmath85 while expression ( [ 41 ] ) for @xmath86 is unchanged .",

    "the charging parameter @xmath33 ( not present in @xmath86 ) has been included .",

    "the @xmath95 is the total free energy per unit volume .",
    "as already concluded , the exchange energy alone results in @xmath77 .",

    "( [ 40 ] ) and ( [ 41 ] ) this means @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are constants . here",
    "@xmath85 ( with @xmath105 ) . for @xmath100",

    "thus @xmath5 varies little and stays near 1 ( for @xmath131 ) . due to this small variation",
    ", we in our numerical work as a great simplification have assumed @xmath5 constant , keeping an average value ( @xmath132 ) when evaluating the correlation energy .",

    "( 31 ) to obtain the alda ( adiabatic local - density approximation ) .",

    "we can now impose thermodynamic self - consistency using a smooth cut - off function with a free ( or an extra free ) parameter to be determined . in this way the equation of state is required to be the same both via the free energy expression and the compressibility .",
    "this , as mentioned earlier , corresponds to the scoza and hrt methods used for classical fluids to obtain very accurate results near the critical region@xcite .",
    "these approaches lead to partial differential equations that are highly non - trivial to solve numerically . for the electron gas ,",
    "however , the two variables of interest enter both through the scaling variable @xmath85 ; so it all simplifies .",
    "however , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we can simplify further .",
    "thus we will utilize the known exact solution .",
    "also the parameter @xmath141 may be considered constant with respect to @xmath33 , since as we have seen , it changes little with electron density .",
    "this leads to a further simplification .",

    "\\label{64}\\ ] ] now this equation is not tied to the rpa , but is valid more generally .",
    "so the problem left is to have a best possible approximation to the resulting correlation function .",
    "then again we keep the msa form ( i38 ) ( with @xmath147 , @xmath148 ) or eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) with @xmath149 @xmath150 where with effective interaction @xmath133 @xmath151 with @xmath144 given by eq .",

    "we have extended the approximation further by keeping @xmath5 constant in the whole interval @xmath155 .",
    "thus the alda curve of fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered from expressions ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 67 ] ) with @xmath156 .",

    "( [ 46 ] ) .",
    "the resulting free energy will deviate somewhat from the exact one , but usually much less than the alda one , depending upon the @xmath134 chosen .",

    "but the change will be small anyway , and has been neglected here .    next",
    "one can search for a smooth cut - off function @xmath134 that reproduces the exact result for the correlation energy @xmath159 .",
    "this can be done by combining two functions @xmath160 and @xmath161 with an additional free parameter @xmath162 @xmath163 with @xmath5 as before .",
    "then self - consistency is imposed by requiring that via eqs .",
    "( [ 63])-([66 ] ) integral ( [ 61 ] ) for the free energy is the exact one .",
    "remaining inaccuracy then lies in the curve for the function @xmath164 where deviations of one sign are compensated by those of opposite sign .",
    "further the @xmath161 can be made as an additional combination of functions with free parameters as in eq .",
    "( [ lmix ] ) below to minimize the inaccuracy of @xmath165 .",
    "it should again be noted that the self - consistency problem discussed above is the analog of the scoza and hrt that both have resulted in very accurate results for classical fluids .",
    "they both have the internal energy type integral ( [ 64 ] ) that computes the response to a change in interaction , i.e.  change in inverse temperature @xmath42 and change in wave vector @xmath66 respectively .",
    "free energy then follows by integration , and it is forced to be consistent with compressibility .",
    "this gives rise to a non - linear partial differential equation . in the present case",
    ", however , the situation simplifies much due to the scaling form ( [ 40 ] ) by which derivatives with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath69 are essentially the same as they join in the scaling variable @xmath85 .",
    "the detailed differential equation of thermodynamic self - consistency is then obtained by equating the @xmath166 that follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 61 ] ) - ( [ 64 ] ) with the @xmath167 that follows from ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "but in view of the discussion and simplifications made above resulting in eq .",
    "( [ 67 ] ) and use of available exact energy , we find no reason to go further in this direction .",
    "along the same lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , here we utilize eqs .

    "thus with these cutoffs the resulting free energies are found and compared with the pw parameterization @xcite in fig .",
    "additionally , the cutoff function ( [ 68 ] ) is implemented by fitting the @xmath162 parameter in this equation so that @xmath78 agrees with the pw parameterization . after various trials , we have found that an optimum fit is obtained with , @xmath170 and @xmath171 which combines two possible different ranges in @xmath66 .",

    "then , for different values of @xmath128 only the value of @xmath174 is adjusted to match the integrated correlation energy @xmath175 . in the lower graph of figure [ frs ]",

    "( [ 67 ] ) using the various smooth cuts ( [ cut1 ] ) - ( [ cut4 ] ) for the function @xmath134 , with @xmath176 fixed . as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gaussian cut ( [ cut4 ] ) performs substantially better than other cuts , clearly outperforming both the rpa and the alda approximation .",

    "@xcite which was further taken from ref .",
    "this deviation we attribute to our very simplified @xmath177 integration with respect to @xmath33 which leads to expression ( [ 67 ] ) .",
    "we can now check to what extent the average core condition on the correlation function behaves due to the approximations we have made . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was used as a condition .",
    "however , it was realized that particles with unequal spins and with coulomb repulsion could , depending upon the particle density , be on the same position .",
    "thus only a crude estimate or guess of the core condition was made . from eq .",

    "then the @xmath134 of eq .",
    "( [ 68 ] ) together with expression ( [ lmix ] ) is used . as it is customary",
    "we represent the function , @xmath181 which can be directly integrated over @xmath66 to yield the correlation energy @xmath78 .",
    "the results for @xmath138 obviously match those of the parameterization best this is the fitted value for all 4 parameters mentioned above , but small departures are visible for low and high electron densities .",
    "recall that aside from the case @xmath138 only a single parameter is fitted to the integrated correlation energy .",
    "the curves tend to overestimate slightly the long wave vector contribution to the correlation , which is compensated by an underestimation at small @xmath17 .",
    "we have evaluated the correlation energy for the uniform quantized fermion gas of electrons , extending our recent work@xcite . in ref .",
    "the core condition , which implies that fermions with equal spins can not be at the same position , played a central role in our approximation .",
    "however , with quantum mechanics particles with opposite spins have the possibility to be at the same position also with coulomb repulsion .",
    "thus the average core condition became somewhat undetermined .",
    "the basis for the computations were the rpa , but with a smooth cut of the coulomb interaction for small distances .",
    "for the free energy an expression inspired by the msa of classical fluids was used .",
    "compared with simulation data , good results were obtained for certain cutoff functions while others led to divergence problems .    inspired by the alda of ref .",
    "@xcite we in this work have focused upon the compressibility relation and thermodynamic self - consistency as used in the scoza and hrt for classical fluids @xcite .",
    "this determines a parameter @xmath5 in the effective interaction .",
    "in addition , we make use of the fact that the effective ( cut ) interaction behaves as a smooth function . the range of the cut is the inverse of @xmath5 . with reasonable cutoff functions , results for the correlation energy substantially improve . also with eqs .",
    "( [ 68 ] ) and ( [ lmix ] ) one has a cut with additional free parameters to reproduce the exact correlation energy . finally , as a more sensitive test of our approach for the free energy , in fig .",
    "[ ecorr ] we present its wave vector decomposition . also for this more detailed analysis we find a good agreement with the simulation results , which again reflects the proper form of the effective ( cut ) interaction used .",
    "our results may be extended to the non - uniform electron gas of molecules .",
    "the basis for the correlation energy will still be the rpa extended to this more general situation .",
    "numerical evaluations will clearly be much more demanding as translational symmetry is lost .",
    "the reference system correlation function is now determined by the eigenstates , including the excited ones , that follows from the dft ( density functional theory ) or hartree - fock solution of the problem considered from which the standard rpa established .",
    "then the rpa is modified such that the full coulomb interaction is replaced by a cut one consistent with or similar to the one obtained for the uniform case studied in this work",
    ". a crucial result of our work is that the cut function @xmath134 is a smooth one that has small or negligible variation with changing electron density .",
    "but there will be some complication as clear density dependence sits in the shift of variable @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "further in the non - uniform case one needs the effective interaction in @xmath1 space , @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) .",
