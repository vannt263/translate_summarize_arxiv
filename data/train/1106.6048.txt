    "the dm mass density profile was until recently the only cluster property that could be inferred from simulations and tested against observational data .",
    "the dm velocity anisotropy profile also holds important information , since it depends on both the dm particle features , such as its collisionless nature ( e.g. host et al.2009 ) and decaying time ( peter , moody , & kamionkowski 2010 ) , and the wide variety of dynamical collapse processes ( wang & white 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , halo mass dynamical estimators , such as jeans ( binney & tremaine 2008 ) and the caustics ( diaferio & geller 97 ; diaferio 99 ) , that use galaxy information , depend on the galaxy velocity anisotropy . since large hydrodynamical cosmological simulations that include galaxies are not found , one can use the dm velocity anisotropy , since both ( dm and galaxies ) are considered to be collisionless , and therefore should have similar dynamical properties .",
    "that said , measured galaxy velocity anisotropy profiles ( e.g. benatov et al .",
    "2006 ; lemze et al .",
    "2009 ) maybe somewhat different than the ones estimated for dm using simulations .",
    "some effort is now devoted to determine also the dm velocity anisotropy either by using the gas temperature as a tracer of the dm velocity anisotropy , a method which is applicable at intermediate radii ( host et al.2009 ) , or by examining galaxy velocities , as has recently been demonstrated in the analysis of a1689 measurements ( lemze et al .",
    "it is in fact our plan to apply the latter procedure to additional relaxed x - ray clusters in the clash program ( postman et al .",

    "n - body simulations ( for various cosmological models ) suggest a nearly universal velocity anisotropy profile ( cole & lacey 1996 ; carlberg et al.1997 ; colin , klypin , & kravtsov 2000 ; diemand , moore , & stadel  2004 ; rasia et al .",

    "their deduced relation was claimed to hold for various systems , including disk galaxy mergers , simulated halos undergoing spherical collapse , and cdm halos both with and without cooling .",
    "however , while an analysis of 6 high - resolution simulated galactic halos from the aquarius project , carried out by navarro et al .",

    "analogous results were obtained in a study conducted by tissera et al.(2010 ) , in which they resimulated 6 ( aquarius ) galactic halos , constructed so as to include metal - dependent cooling , star formation , and supernova feedback . in 3 of the halos a rather good match to the hm06 relation was found at small radii , @xmath11 , but no corresponding match was found in the other 3 halos . no evidence is seen for the hm06 relation at large radii , @xmath12 , in any of the six halos .",

    "such a relation between the dm density and velocity anisotropy is of interest , since if it exists in relaxed systems , as claimed in previous works ( e.g. hansen & stadel 2006 ; hansen 2009 ) , this can be an indicator for the system relaxation level .",
    "in addition , since dm velocity anisotropy is not easily measurable , whereas the density profile can be determined in several different ways based on different sets of measurements , we can use the @xmath7 - @xmath8 relation to infer the dm velocity anisotropy from the density profile .",

    "the large number of halos at different redshifts allows us to address the dependence of the dm velocity anisotropy profile on redshift , halo mass , degree of relaxation , modeled both as spherical and triaxial dm configurations , and to address also the @xmath5-@xmath0 relation .",

    "radial profiles were extracted in both spherical and triaxial shells . the mass distribution is described in terms of the axial ratios of the density surface contours . assuming that the density distribution is stratified in similar ellipsoids , it is possible to determine the axial ratios without knowledge of the radial density distribution ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 , but see also other works e.g. katz  1991 ; warren et al .",

    "an advantage of this scheme is the equal weighting given to each particle irrespective of its radial position ( see zemp et al .",

    "particle positions are first rotated into the diagonalized frame of @xmath52 , where only particles inside of the ellipse volume were taken ( a sphere , in the first iteration ) .",
    "the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined from @xmath52 and then used to recalculate @xmath39 in this new frame and fed back into the @xmath50 relation to determine iterated values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "when the input values match the output values within a certain tolerance , convergence to the true axial ratios is achieved .    in each iteration",
    "new values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined , so the halo volume is deformed .",
    "we kept the magnitude of the semi - major axis equal to @xmath53 of the original spherical radius , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "this radius was chosen and not a longer one , so the ellipticity will not be affected by closeby clumps .",
    "thus , during the volume deformation only the two smaller axes were changed .",

    "the dm velocity anisotropy profile for each halo was determined as follows : we first identified the halo center with the peak of the surrounding 3d density distribution and then determined the proper ( non - comoving ) velocities of the dm particles with respect to the cluster center by subtracting the velocity of the halo center .",
    "this procedure was carried out for 15 equally spaced shells within the virial radius , a division that yields dm particle counts of the same order of magnitude in each bin .",
    "logarithmic spacing was impractical due to the low spatial resolution .",

    "the value was consistent in less than 1% on average with the value estimated using the nfw best - fit parameters .",
    "the distinction between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters was made according to five criteria some of which were laid down by thomas et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and neto et al .",
    "these are based on the following quantities :    1 .",
    "the displacement between the center of mass , @xmath83 , and the potential minimum , @xmath84 , with the latter quantity calculated including particles within the virial radius .",
    "the displacement was normalized with respect to the spherical virial radius , @xmath85 ( see also neto et al .",
    "2 .   the virial ratio , @xmath86 ( see also neto et al .  2007 ) . we computed the total kinetic and gravitational energies of the halo particles within @xmath87 .",
    "when halos were modeled as triaxial , their major axes were set equal to the virial radii of the respective spherical configurations . for the estimation of @xmath88 we subtracted the motion of the halo center , whereas @xmath89 was calculated using a random sample of 1000 particles .",
    "we estimated the precision level of this method by ( a ) repeating the calculation 10 times for the most massive halo ( the one containing the largest number of dm particles ) , which generated a relative difference of @xmath90 , and ( b ) calculating @xmath89 in a single halo , using @xmath91 particles .",
    "the relative average difference produced by this method was @xmath92 .",
    "3 .   the corrected virial ratio , @xmath93 . for details about this criterion see  [ correction for the virial ratio ] .",
    "4 .   the displacement between the density peak @xmath94 and the center of mass @xmath83 , with the latter quantity calculated using particles within the virial radius .",

    "the displacement was normalized with respect to the spherical virial radius , @xmath96 .    in equilibrium",
    "@xmath97 would be expected to vanish , the virial ratio would approach a value slightly higher than unity , since even in relaxed systems there always is some infalling matter , and the corrected virial ratio ( for more details see  [ correction for the virial ratio ] ) should approach unity . while all five criteria are related to the degree of relaxation in a straightforward manner ,",
    "the boundary levels between the two phases are quite arbitrary .",
    "for example , for the first two neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) adopted @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    in this paper we focused on the first three criteria ; however , the correlations between all of the five criteria and other parameters are shown in  [ appendix ] .",
    "halos are not isolated systems , since matter is continuously falling onto them .",
    "thus , we also calculated the virial ratio taking under consideration the infalling matter onto the halos , which was claimed to have a significant overall contribution to the pressure at the halo boundaries ( shaw et al .",
    "2006 ; davis , daloisio , & natarajan 2011 ) .",
    "this modification manifests itself as a form of surface pressure at the boundaries of the halos ( chandrasekhar 1961 ; voit 2005 , and references within ) , so in steady state the virial equation is @xmath100 .",
    "here we estimated the surface pressure term in an eulerian virial theorem version , since each of the halos has a known ( fixed ) volume ( see mckee & zweibel 1992 ; ballesteros - paredes 2006 , and references therein ) . thus , its energy content is @xmath101 where the loop denotes integration over a closed surface , and the summation is over all particles in a shell with surface @xmath102 and volume @xmath103 .",
    "the symbols @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 are the dm particle mass , vector position and velocity , and the outward normal component of @xmath108 , respectively . in practice , we followed shaw et al .  and computed @xmath109 in the outer 20% of the spherical virial ( elliptical ) radius in the spherical ( elliptical ) shells case ( repeating the analysis for 10% of the virial radius ) .",
    "the innermost , median , and outer shells were taken to be @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , respectively .    in the case of spherical symmetry @xmath113 ,",
    "since the integration is carried out over the angles , and the radius is constant .",
    "we can estimate the surface pressure term as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 $ ] is the outer 20% shell volume .",
    "thus , @xmath116 .    in the case where the halo mass distribution is modeled as an ellipsoid with isodensity surfaces @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the `` direction '' of the surface",
    "( @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 is the expression given in eq .",
    "[ r_e ] , so @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are at the particle position .",
    "thus , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , where this is done for each particle in the elliptical shell at the elliptical virial radius .    in figure  [ mean_es_vs_virial_ratio_spheric_n_elliptic ] we plotted the correction term as a function of the virial ratio .",
    "it is easy to see that the correction is larger in elliptical shells .",
    "thus , for accurately using this proxy , using spherical shells maybe not good enough .",

    "the values of the relaxation criteria were chosen such that in each plot both relaxed and unrelaxed samples have about the same number of halos , so the histograms will have a similar normalization .",
    "similar to figures  [ q_n_s_histograms_relaxation_by_s ] - [ q_n_s_histograms_relaxation_by_corrected_virial_ratio ] , in figure  [ relaxed_unrelaxed_ratio_vs_q ] we plotted the fraction of relaxed clusters , @xmath127 , vs halo ellipticity .",
    "here we took only halos with @xmath68 since more elliptical halos are rare and therefore give poor statistics .",
    "in addition , for halos with @xmath69 the values of both relaxation criteria are strongly dependent on the length of the ellipse major axis , which is likely due to the fact that many of them are in the process of a major merger and highly unrelaxed .",
    "the threshold was chosen so the three will have about the same normalization at @xmath128 .",
    "the fraction of relaxed halos at different ellipticities is a little bit more sensitive to @xmath97 than to @xmath86 and @xmath93 .    in figure",

    "this is a convenient way to see the differences in the halos 3d shape between relaxed and unrelaxed halos .      in figure  [ q_n_s_diff_radii_z0 ] ( top panel )",
    "we plotted the averaged @xmath41 and @xmath42 values over halos at @xmath35 at different portions of the virial radius for the semi - major axis .",
    "only halos with a large number of particles , @xmath130 , inside the smallest radius , @xmath131 , were taken , which gave @xmath132 halos .",
    "we also plotted ( bottom panel ) the axes ratios for relaxed halos , @xmath133 , which gave us 115 halos .",
    "the halo ellipticity first decreases a small amount , until @xmath134 , then their ellipticity increases .",
    "in other words on average the halos are more elliptical at small radii then with increasing radius they become more spherical , and then elliptical again .",
    "this behavior is a little bit more pronounce in relaxed halos . however , the change is small , even in the relaxed sample , and over the radius range @xmath135 the axes ratios are quite constant , @xmath136 and @xmath137 and @xmath138 and @xmath139 , for the whole @xmath132 halo sample and for the relaxed one , respectively , especially compared to the large scatter .      to assess the impact of an aspherical halo configuration , we plot in figure  [ different shells ] the velocity anisotropy profiles in both spherical and elliptical shells for all high - mass halos ( @xmath140 h@xmath141 m@xmath15 ) .",

    "the main effect was a decrease in the @xmath5 value range .",
    "this can be due to the fact that with a lower number of bins the minimum and maximum bins are closer and the mean has lower variance . in the second test we checked the 100 most massive halos , which obviously have higher number of particles per shell than the full sample . in both cases",
    "the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 did not increase significantly , as can be seen in figure  [ beta_gamma_z0_100mostmassive ] for the @xmath0 and @xmath5 plot of the 100 most massive halos .",
    "as expected , since the @xmath0 values were taken within the virial radius , and since their largest difference between spherical and elliptical shells is at @xmath163 , when we repeated this above analysis with triaxial halos , the results were essentially the same as those obtained for spherical halos .",
    "significant progress has recently been made in the ability to deduce the kinematic properties of dm in clusters from galaxy dynamics and x - ray measurements .",
    "comparison of these properties with results from numerical simulations can clearly test analysis methods and add new insights on dm phase space occupation .",
    "we presented results from an analysis of dm velocities in @xmath31 halos with masses @xmath164 h@xmath28 m@xmath15 at redshift @xmath35 , drawn from one of the largest ever hydrodynamic cosmological amr simulations .",
    "we found that each halo ellipticity depends strongly on the major axis length .",
    "this is because for each halo ellipsoids with different sizes include different parts of substructure and infalling clumps , which obviously affect the ellipticity , if they are inside or close to the ellipse .",
    "however , averaging over many halos , @xmath132 , the halo ellipticity first decreases a small amount , until @xmath134 , then the averaged ellipticity increases .",
    "in other words on average the halos are more elliptical at small radii then with increasing radius they become more spherical , and then elliptical again , since at large radii other structures are located inside the ellipsoid and this on average increases the ellipticity .",
    "however , the change is small , even in the relaxed sample , and over the radius range @xmath135 the axis ratios are essentially constant , @xmath136 and @xmath137 and @xmath165 and @xmath166 , for the whole @xmath132 halo sample and for the relaxed one , respectively , especially compared to the large scatter .",
    "this ellipticity vs radius behavior is in agreement with allgood et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who found that halos become more spherical up to @xmath167 , and bailin & steinmetz ( 2005 ) , who found the ellipticity is quite constant compared with the scatter .",
    "kuhlen et al .  ( 2007 ) , hayashi et al .  (",
    "2007 ) , and vera - ciro et al.(2011 ) used various n - body simulations and found that , similarly to cluster - size halos , in galaxy - size halos the core is more elliptical than a few hundreds of kpc away .",
    "however , hopkins , bahcall , & bode  ( 2005 ) found that cluster cores are less elliptical than cluster outskirts    we have employed five different relaxation criteria and focused on three of them , @xmath97 , @xmath86 , and @xmath93 ; see the appendix for the correlations of these three with the two other relaxation proxies we also considered .",
    "relaxed halos tend to be more spherical while unrelaxed halos tend to be more prolate .",
    "this is seen using various relaxation criteria , e.g. @xmath97 , @xmath86 , @xmath93 .",
    "this can be explained by the evolution of clusters from highly aligned and elongated systems at early times to lower alignment and elongation at present , which reflects the hierarchical and filamentary nature of structure formation ( hopkins , bahcall , & bode  2005 ) .",
    "indeed , vera - ciro et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who analyzed aquarius data , found that @xmath41 increases with time .",
    "this is also in agreement with shaw et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who found that low mass halos , which are older than their higher mass counterparts and therefore had a longer time to relax dynamically , attain a more spherical morphology than high mass halos .",
    "our study indicates that the profiles of cluster dm velocity anisotropy have a similar pattern when these are averaged over all halo masses , redshifts , and relaxation stages , even though there is a considerable scatter in magnitude due to the large differences in the @xmath0 profile of individual halos .",
    "a typical behavior is a rising @xmath0 profile from a nearly vanishing central value , leveling off at @xmath168 , out to large radii of at least @xmath169 .",
    "this plateau is clearer in elliptical shells and at lower redshifts .",
    "the rising value from zero at small radii behavior is in agreement with previous works ( e.g. crone et al .",
    "1994 ; tormen et al .  1997 ; thomas et al .",
    "1998 ; eke et al .",
    "1998;colin et al .  2000 ; rasia et al.2004 ) .",
    "interestingly , lau , nagai , & kravtsov  ( 2010 ) showed that the inclusion of radiative cooling and star formation in the simulation slightly lowers the @xmath0 values at @xmath35 but not at @xmath36 .",
    "unrelaxed halos have lower @xmath0 values , which indicates that the dm particles infall is less radial than in relaxed halos .",
    "lower mass halos have , on average , lower @xmath0 levels at @xmath167 , and therefore even shallower profiles .",
    "this behavior could possibly be due to the ability to reach higher accretion velocities at lower redshifts when the background density is much lower .",
    "however , our mass range , especially in elliptical shells , is very small , so these findings are preliminary .",
    "some effort is now devoted to determine @xmath0 either by using the gas temperature as a tracer of it , a method which was applied for 16 clusters at intermediate radii ( host et al .",
    "2009 ) , or by examining galaxy velocities , as has recently been demonstrated in the analysis of a1689 measurements ( lemze et al .  2011 ) .",
    "interestingly , these indirect measurements of @xmath0 fall on the upper end of the theoretically expected range . both methods assume steady state , i.e. @xmath170 . clusters on the other hand are not in steady state , since matter is continuously falling onto them .",
    "however , at small radii ( the indirect measurements radii range ) , i.e. @xmath171 @xmath87 , this effect on @xmath0 is negligible , @xmath172 . in a recent work ,",
    "peter , moody , & kamionkowski ( 2010 ) used simulations and showed that for galaxy - size halos , the expected @xmath0 increases with radius till about the virial radius when dm particles decay to a slightly less massive particle with a large decaying time , @xmath173 a few gyr , and a high velocity kick , @xmath174 km s@xmath14 .",
    "lastly , we find that there is some correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 at low radii , @xmath175 , and that such a correlation can be induced at all radii merely by assuming a prescribed dm density profile ( since when assuming a profile the @xmath5 values are correlated and therefore the scatter along the @xmath5 axis is reduced ) . the level of @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath0 correlation is very low at large radii , @xmath176 , even for very relaxed halos . repeating the same analysis with elliptical shells led to the same result .",
    "indeed , most of the works that try to explain the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 focus on the inner regions .",
    "hansen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hansen ( 2009 ) assumed spherically symmetric systems in hydrostatic equilibrium , and that high energy tail of the tangential velocity distribution function follows that of the radial velocity distribution function , based on which they explain the @xmath5-@xmath0 relation mainly at small radii where both @xmath5 and @xmath0 are about zero . an & evans ( 2006 , and references therein ) have deduced that @xmath177 .",
    "ciotti & morganti ( 2010 ) claimed that this inequality holds not only at the center , but also at larger radii in a very large class of spherical systems whenever the phase - space distribution function is positive .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * galaxy clusters are generally triaxial . *",
    "relaxed halos tend to be more spherical while unrelaxed halos tend to be more prolate .",
    "* low mass halos tend to be more relaxed ( see  [ appendix ] ) , though this result is based on a narrow mass range and therefore should be considered preliminary . *",
    "the ellipticity of each halo strongly depends on the semi - major axis amplitude .",
    "however , averaging over many halos , @xmath132 , there is no significant difference in the ellipticity at ellipses with different semi - major axis amplitudes , even in the relaxed sample . *",
    "the @xmath97 is a better relaxation proxy than @xmath86 and @xmath93 in the sense that its correlation with the halo ellipticity is stronger . *",
    "the pressure term , @xmath178 , is larger in elliptical sells and in less relaxed halos ( when the relaxation criterion is @xmath86 ) . *",
    "dm velocity anisotropy profiles have a similar pattern when these are averaged over all halo masses , redshifts , triaxiality , and relaxation stages , even though there is a considerable scatter in magnitude due to the large differences in the @xmath0 profile of individual halos .",

    "dm velocity anisotropy indirect measurements fall on the upper edge of the theoretical expectations ( see figure  [ different shells ] ) . though measured indirectly , the estimations are derived by using two different surrogate measurement , i.e. x - ray and galaxy dynamics .",
    "so far the dm velocity anisotropy estimates were based on a very low number of clusters ( 16 via x - ray and 1 via galaxy dynamics ) .",
