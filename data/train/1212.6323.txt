    "in the past few years , large - scale such as facebook , twitter and renren have become a major part of people s daily life . besides serving as a communication and information - sharing platform for their users , these also play a key role in friends discovery and community formation for users of common interests . despite the overwhelming success of the existing sns ,",
    "the centralized ownership and control of these services have led to serious concerns in user privacy , censorship and operational robustness .",
    "since the operator of an sns has full knowledge of the profiles , social relationships and communication activities of their users , it is a high - value and obvious target for not only the typical attackers but also many totalitarian regimes which constantly seek to monitor and control information dissemination among their people .    to overcome the drawbacks of centralized osns , decentralized social networks ( dsn ) such as diaspora@xcite , musubi@xcite and onesocialweb@xcite",
    "have recently been proposed and implemented . under these dsn architectures ,",
    "no single party possesses the full knowledge of the entire social network . for example , in the diaspora network , a server ( super - node ) only has its own partial view of those users registered within it .",
    "it is even more restrictive in the musubi network in which every user only has visibility of his / her own relationships in form of a contact book ; even if a user can consult his direct friends for their friend lists , his knowledge of the network is still constrained to 2 hops .",
    "current efforts of are mainly on system prototyping .",
    "although the design of many building blocks for dsn can be adapted from prior p2p system designs , the nature of imposes further challenges : due to privacy and trust concern , available information for a single node is limited .",
    "for example , in a bt swarm , nodes are willing to exchange content with complete strangers as long as they provide each other enough upload rate . in , however , people only want to share contents ( profile , status , blog , album , etc ) within certain scope .    while the compartmentalized approach of the dsns can enhance user privacy and make them less vulnerable to monitoring , censorship and sabotage attacks , the lack of global knowledge for the dsn nodes makes it much more difficult to support some common but critical services such as friend discovery/ recommendations and community detection .",
    "in particular , the dsn architecture invalidates many assumptions on data availability and global network topology awareness which are required by most existing community detection algorithms .    to address this challenge",
    ", this paper considers the following problem for the s : given a user and his / her partial knowledge of the social graph , can we predict which nodes are in the same _ community _ with him ?",
    "the solution of this problem can support many fundamental services of including friends recommendation , targeted advertisement , automated relationship labeling and sybil defense .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the design and performance evaluation of _ localized _ and _ fully - decentralized _ community detection algorithms for _ large - scale _ s based on the personalized page rank ( ppr ) approach :    * by `` localized '' , we mean that every node s knowledge of the network is limited to its local neighborhood topology .",
    "this is in contrast to other so - called localized approaches , e.g. the local graph partitioning algorithm in @xcite , for which global network topology is actually available even though the algorithm may choose not to fully explore or leverage such information .",
    "* by `` fully - decentralized '' , we mean that every individual node within the dsn can execute our proposed community detection algorithm based on its locally acquired knowledge . explicit coordination from other nodes is not needed .",
    "in contrast , many existing `` distributed community detection '' algorithms , e.g. those proposed in @xcite and @xcite , do require exchange of information and collaboration among the network nodes .",
    "* by `` large - scale '' , we mean that our algorithm is designed to be scalable for dsns of sizes comparable to the existing top - tier osns . in fact , we evaluate our proposed algorithm in section  [ sec : data ] using real data collected from the renren social network in china ( which already had 160 million registered users by 2011@xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , even if we only consider the 2-hop local neighborhood of a target renren user , the size of the topological data is already very substantial : on average , each user has around 350 direct friends and 75,000 friends - of - friends .",
    "in fact , the size of the local topology of a single target user in our study is already as large as many medium - sized data sets used for evaluating many global community detection algorithms reported in the literature .    in short ,",
    "this paper has made the following technical contributions :    * we formulate the new problem of community detection under the constraint of limited local topology awareness found in dsns .",
    "* we adapt the personalized page rank ( ) algorithm for community detection under limited topology information . in particular , by interpreting as an ink spilling process",
    ", we justify its applicability for community detection for a target user . *",
    "we investigate different design choices of the escape vector ( ev ) for .",
    "their impact on community detection performance are evaluated using real - world data sets collected from the large - scale renren social network .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : rwork ] , we survey related works . in section  [ sec :",
    "form ] , we formulate the community detection problem on 2-hop - only topology of the social network graph . in section",
    "[ sec : algorithm ] , we analyze the problem and propose our algorithm based on the approach . in section  [ sec : eval ] , we evaluate the performance of our proposal by comparing it with other commonly - deployed heuristics , and study the effect of different choices of escape vectors in depth .",
    "we then conclude the this paper in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "community detection is a classical problem of partitioning a graph into multiple ( possibly overlapping ) subsets ( communities ) while satisfying the following conditions : intra - community linkage is dense and inter - community linkage is sparse . in the literature , this principle has been realized in many different ways including modularity maximization , conductance minimization and normalized cut minimization @xcite .",
    "so far , modularity maximization @xcite has been the most popular approach for community detection .",
    "however , since the resultant combinatorial optimization problem is np - hard , researchers have proposed many heuristics to obtain approximate solutions .",
    "newman @xcite proposed an eigen decomposition approach plus a local search algorithm .",
    "agarwal @xcite leveraged several mathematical programing techniques .",
    "those works are the first batch that focus on detecting community based on only full topology information .",
    "since pure topology - based community detection algorithms are well developed by now , many researchers are trying to incorporate more side information to enhance performance of existing algorithms . in @xcite ,",
    "sachan et al combine social graph topology , interaction pattern , and topics to discover topically meaningful communities . in @xcite ,",
    "lin studies the scenario where node - level information is complete ( like authors bag - of - words coordinates ) but only part of the topology is observed .",
    "note however that complete node - level information is still too hard to be acquired in the scenario .    all of the above community detection algorithms are centralized ones requiring global information . besides the data constraint ,",
    "those global algorithms are usually computational intensive , which makes them inapplicable for large - scale osns . as such , our study of scalable and localized algorithms is important even under the centralized settings .",
    "it is worth to note that researchers have proposed some algorithms to tackle with large - scale graphs in centralized settings .",
    "@xcite proposed a label propagation ( lp ) algorithm whose complexity for one iteration is linear of number of edges .",
    "lp initializes nodes with their unique labels and nodes switch to the majority label owned by their neighbours at each iteration .",
    "@xcite conducted more experiments on the lp algorithm and proposed several improvements . since our algorithm only requires local topology of each node , it is easy to be parallelized and scale to large graphs naturally under the centralized settings .",
    "we leave the combination of multiple runs of our localized algorithm to form a global community to future work .",
    "we mentioned several applications of community detection algorithms on in section  [ sec : intro ] . in the literature , friend recommendation is also associated with the problem of link prediction@xcite .",
    "although many sophisticated algorithms have been developed , they also suffer from their forbidding computational requirement like global community detection algorithms do . for large - scale osn in practice ,",
    "simple heuristics are believed to be in use .",
    "veneta @xcite , for example , uses common neighbor to do friend discovery but their focus is on how to achieve this simple heuristic securely .",
    "while no detail information is available for the proprietary friend recommendation algorithms used by commercial service providers , a recent post @xcite by the tecent research team noted the deficiency of using common neighbors heuristic for community detection .",
    "it also expressed their concern of the computational burden of mature global optimization methods .",
    "community detection output can assist many other topics . detecting community in decentralized scenario can also help research in those topics . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss a few of them .    to design the dtn routing algorithm , bubblerap@xcite , pan used the knowledge of community and centrality as heuristics .",
    "it is shown that video views preserves good locality in terms of both geo - locations@xcite and social network topology@xcite .",
    "the key observation is that , many interest diffusion processes have some target communities .",
    "community detection result can help to improve the performance of those social network assisted content distribution .",
    "social network assisted sybil defense also draws a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "it includes sybil identity detection and sybil community detection@xcite .",
    "the latter one is the same problem as community detection .",
    "what differs is that the structural assumptions in sybil defense schemes are usually stronger and its application is more sensitive to tp or fp depending on the scenario . with locally detected communities",
    ", nodes can share information to form a trust region , thus excluding nodes who are highly susceptible to be sybil .",
    "we model the social network as a graph where each node corresponds to a person and each link corresponds to a relationship . for social networks in practice ,",
    "relationships can be directed ( like following on twitter ) or undirected ( like being friends on facebook ) . in this work ,",
    "we focus on undirected relationship only .",
    "let s denote the undirected social graph as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the vertex ( node ) set and @xmath2 is the edge ( link ) set .",
    "we also denote a node @xmath3 using the shorthand notation @xmath4 . given a node @xmath4 , we denote its @xmath5-hop neighbour set as @xmath6 .",
    "iteratively , we can define the @xmath7-hop neighbour set as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the set of edges that can be observed within @xmath7-hop is @xmath10 .    using the above notations",
    ", we can define the local topology information available to a user as follows : we call a normal user of as `` observer '' , denoted by @xmath11 . how much information the observer can get depends on the application scenario . given an observer @xmath11 , the @xmath12-hop local topology is @xmath13 . to facilitate discussions ,",
    "we define @xmath14 to be the number of nodes and @xmath15 to be the number of edges .",
    "[ fig:2hop ] gives an illustration of @xmath16 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2hop_pic ] , the central biggest node(o ) is the observer .",
    "nodes denoted by `` l1 '' are the direct friends of the observer , also referred to as the level 1 nodes ( reachable within 1 hop ) .",
    "similarly , nodes denoted by `` l2 '' can be reached within 2 hops and are referred to as level 2 nodes .",
    "dark thick edges show the links which are visible to the observer .",
    "light thin edges show possibly existing links but the observer can not see them within its 2 hop visibility .",
    "dashed region shows a probable community since those nodes have dense linkage inside and sparse linkage outside .",
    "[ fig:2hop_matrix ] illustrates the observer s knowledge of the adjacency matrix .",
    "nodes are ordered and labeled using the same convention as the left panel .",
    "the black area is the part known to the observer .",
    "the white vacancy represents zeros in the adjacency matrix .",
    "the shadowed square is unknown , including the light thin edges in the left figure .      as an initial study of community detection on",
    ", we formulate the problem assuming only 2-hop topology information is available for the target user .",
    "the reasons are :    * * 2-hop is the smallest topology to study*. the 1-hop subgraph from an observer is a simple star , and there is no further topology information to utilize . *",
    "* osn diameter continues to shrink*. dating back to 1929 , frigyes karinthy proposed the concept of 6 degree(7 hops ) separation @xcite .",
    "stanley milgram conducted experiments in 1960 to show an average degree of 5.2 ( 6 hops)@xcite . according to facebook s study in the end of 2011 @xcite , the separation in the facebook network was 5.28 hops in 2008 but became 4.74 hops in 2011 . * * average node degree is very high*. dunbar s number @xcite estimates the number of stable relationships of a typical person to be 150 .",
    "the renren network ( further explained in section  [ sec : data ] ) is much better connected than that and the size of topology data associated with a local neighborhood would increase rapidly with the hop - count .",
    "* * there are existing heuristics on only 2-hop topology*. heuristics like common neighbors and adamic / adar score@xcite ( further explained in section  [ sec : roc_4f ] ) can be computed exactly within 2 hop and provide reasonable baseline for our study . *",
    "* trust concern prevents user from looking further away*. in the extreme case of , users only have their own first hop topology ( e.g. through musubi s contact book ) . the 2-hop topology can be obtained by requesting those direct friends and is reliable .",
    "however , asking a stranger for his buddy list may risk at polluting the raw data and resulting in meaningless detection result .",
    "conventional community detection is formulated as a clustering problem .",
    "that is , given the full graph @xmath0 , partition the vertex set into @xmath17 subsets @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the notion of community is that nodes within the same community have dense linkage and nodes from different communities have sparse linkage . to implement this concept mathematically",
    ", people proposed different quality measures @xmath21 on a partitioning .",
    "thus the clustering version of community detection problem becomes ( consider the non - overlapping case ) @xmath22 whether the `` maximize '' or `` minimize '' operator is used depends on the nature of the quality measure .",
    "one implementation of @xmath21 is the modularity proposed by newman@xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the degree of node @xmath4 , @xmath27 is the total number of edges .",
    "modularity in essence measures how far the resulting partition is from a random graph and , the higher the better .",
    "there are other quality measures , e.g. conductance .",
    "interested readers can refer to @xcite for more information .",
    "the clustering formulation draws a lot of interest in the past .",
    "one reason is that the form is clean and highly amenable for theoretical studies .",
    "the other reason is that at the time when people started to do community detection , there were no successful large - scale s. researchers did not have ground - truth to validate whether a community partitioning is _",
    "correct_. so the clustering formulation and quality function evaluation became the mainstream approach in the research community .    with the wide acceptance of in the recent years , labeled data become available .",
    "for instance , in the renren social network graph , every node is associated with an institution name @xmath28 , representing his / her university , high school , company , etc .",
    "note that a person may have multiple institutions in reality . for the moment , we consider the social graph with only one institution name @xmath28 for each node @xmath4 .",
    "details regarding multiple institution names are put in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "since the ground - truth is available , evaluating the community detection result against the crawled ground - truth is more reasonable .",
    "mathematically speaking , given an observer @xmath11 and its 2-hop local topology @xmath16 , we want to determine @xmath29 whether @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the set of test nodes .",
    "@xmath32 means that we evaluate the algorithm on all nodes within 2 hops , which fits the application of friend recommendation .",
    "@xmath33 means that we only evaluate the algorithm on only level 1 nodes , which fits the application of automated friend categorization .",
    "both choices of @xmath34 will be evaluated in section  [ sec : eval ] .",
    "we then cast this decision problem as a binary - classification problem , i.e. assign a label @xmath35 ( the ground - truth ) to each node : @xmath36 the algorithm should take the 2-hop topology as input and output predicted labels @xmath37 .    the confusion matrix of classification result is shown in fig .",
    "[ tbl : confm ] . using the notation in the confusion matrix",
    ", we have multiple standard ways to evaluate the quality of predicted labels @xmath38 , such as accuracy : @xmath39 true positive rate @xmath40 and false positive rate @xmath41    in section  [ sec : eval ] , we will further analyze the shortcomings of the above evaluation methods and propose to use and to evaluate key steps of the algorithm in depth .

    "it is clear that more pre - known positive nodes help to improve the performance of on our 2-hop community detection settings but there is only a little benefit ( @xmath48 increase of from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , i.e. an 8.8% relative improvement ) . besides the increase of mean , larger @xmath47 results in smaller variance , which is also appreciated in real applications .",

    "* more labels help a little*. in the random setting , putting more nodes in the results in minor linear benefit . in the high degree setting ,",

    "[ fig : com_ink ] also indicates that more stringent @xmath58 should be set in order for the ink spilling approach to converge .",
    "this is because the definition of @xmath58-approximation in the ink spilling algorithm involves node degree .",
    "for example , suppose we have a local topology with @xmath65 , at least @xmath66 is required to make the total error upper bounded by @xmath67 when the algorithm converges .",
    "the extensive simulations above show that ppr is an effective and flexible proximity measure . with appropriate parameters , the ppr score can be used as a reasonable ranking function for our binary classification framework .",
    "we have also remarked that the application of ppr on l1 nodes are more appropriate for real application .",
    "there are good roc points to target and we mentioned some methods , e.g. using prior distribution or detecting sharp drop , to target them .",
    "we illustrated the use of prior distribution .",
    "however , it is not trivial to set proper threshold in order to get final detection result . we leave this as a future work .",
    "we have also remarked that 2-hop topology is not enough for detecting community of all 2-hop nodes ( l1 + l2 ) .",
    "meanwhile , 2-hop topology is promising for community detection of l1 nodes .",
    "if we constrain the evaluation nodes to l1 nodes only , our formulation has become node classification on an ego - network . in the preparation of this manuscript",
    ", we found other similar works to tackle with node classification locally on an ego - network . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors developed a probabilistic model that leverages both topology information and node - level information to discover social circles of an ego .",
    "demon @xcite proposed to solve the centralized community detection of large graphs by first detecting communities locally and then combine them globally .",
    "it first uses label propagation @xcite to detect community on ego - network of all nodes and then combine locally detected communities by thresholding their intersection .",
    "our observations in the experiments and those works show that ego - network is a promising direction to go . stepping back to our original problem",
    ", we see that auc of ppr on l2 still has some improvements to basic heuristics .",
    "although there are no good roc points for direct application , the benefit brought by ppr may be useful in some extensions of the current problem .",
    "one possible extension of the current problem is to allow cooperation among direct friends or a small number of collaborating observers in the network .",
    "another direction is the development of privacy preserving protocols for dsn which can allow users to help each other to improve their personal community detection without requiring excessive trust .",
    "it is worth to note that overlapping community detection has also drawn a lot of interest in recent years .",
    "our ppr proposal is readily available for overlapping community detection .",
    "in essence , ppr reveals the proximity of nodes to a set of seeds .",
    "the observer can provide different sets of seeds so as to reveal different communities .",
    "the detecting result can be overlapping .",
    "in the simulation , it seems that we used more information than topology and people concerns about privacy of the data .",
    "we briefly discuss the data source as follows : 1 ) 2-hop topology is natural under most settings , e.g. on many osn s , users can check their friends buddy lists ; 2 ) in the ev allocation , the observer manually label some positive nodes ( or nodes he / she believes to be positive ) , thus requiring no collaboration from others ; 3 ) in the high degree heuristic , degree information can be calculated directly on 2-hop topology ( however the degree of l2 node is under estimated ) .",
    "note that we can not know all node labels first and then sample random positive nodes or high degree positive nodes . in practice",
    ", user just identifies a set of positive nodes regardless of other node properties .",
    "this can be implemented and the effect should be similar to random node heuristic .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the community detection problem of any given user under the constraint of limited topology information imposed by emerging s .",
    "in particular , we consider the scenario where only 2-hop topology information is available to the given target user . instead of following the clustering approach taken by most traditional works of community detection ,",
    "our formulation yields a binary classification problem which can be evaluated against ground - truth data collected from real - world s. we then establish a two - stage framework for this problem and transform our problem to the finding of a good ranking function of nodes in the test set . in particular , we adapt the notion of ppr for this purpose and justify its applicability on community detection via the ink spilling interpretation of ppr .",
    "our evaluation using real - world osn data shows that even with the topology as small as 2-hop we can `` discover '' a target user s community .",
    "our proposed approach significantly outperforms the basic version of and two other heuristics believed to be commonly used by large - scale osns in practice .",
    "our study shows that manually labeling just a few positive nodes for can boost the performance .",

    "<S> despite the overwhelming success of the existing social networking services ( sns ) , their centralized ownership and control have led to serious concerns in user privacy , censorship vulnerability and operational robustness of these services . to overcome these limitations , distributed social networks ( dsn ) have recently been proposed and implemented . under these new dsn architectures , no single party possesses the full knowledge of the entire social network . while this approach solves the above problems , the lack of global knowledge for the dsn nodes makes it much more challenging to support some common but critical sns services like friends discovery and community detection . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we tackle the problem of community detection for a given user under the constraint of limited local topology information as imposed by common dsn architectures . by considering the personalized page rank ( ppr ) approach as an ink spilling process </S>",
    "<S> , we justify its applicability for decentralized community detection using limited local topology information . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed ppr - based solution has a wide range of applications such as friends recommendation , targeted advertisement , automated social relationship labeling and sybil defense . </S>",
    "<S> using data collected from a large - scale sns in practice , we demonstrate our adapted version of ppr can significantly outperform the basic pr as well as two other commonly used heuristics </S>",
    "<S> . the inclusion of a few manually labeled friends in the escape vector ( ev ) can boost the performance considerably ( 64.97% relative improvement in terms of area under the roc curve ( auc ) ) . </S>"
