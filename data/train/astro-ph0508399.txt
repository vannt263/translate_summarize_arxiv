    "leptogenesis @xcite is an attractive scenario to account for the observed matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry of the universe . in the scenario ,",
    "a lepton asymmetry is generated by the decay of massive right - handed ( majorana ) neutrinos , @xmath0 , which are responsible for the ( small ) masses of left - handed neutrinos via the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the lepton asymmetry is then translated to a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes @xcite around the electroweak era .",
    "leptogenesis is analogous to gut baryogenesis @xcite in that a massive particle decays with cp violation , and boltzmann equations may be employed to track the time evolution of particles and the asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the massive particles ( in the case of leptogenesis , the @xmath0s ) must be created after inflation , either nonthermally or thermally during reheating , or thermally during the radiation - dominated era .",
    "thermal leptogenesis @xcite has been widely studied , but a careful analysis must be done in order to account for all the thermal and perturbative reactions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "nonthermal leptogenesis leptogenesis is an attractive alternative @xcite .",
    "here , we propose a new model of nonthermal leptogenesis involving instant preheating .",
    "our model assumes hybrid inflation @xcite , in which inflation is terminated by an abrupt transition in the properties of the scalar - field potential dominating the energy density during inflation .",
    "such an abrupt change is often modeled as being triggered the action of a second `` waterfall '' field , causing the effective scalar - field to roll into another dimension in the scalar - field landscape .",
    "an important feature of hybrid inflation is that the properties of the scalar - field potential ( _ e.g. , _ the mass ) during reheating may be quite different than the properties of the scalar - field potential during inflation .",
    "our model assumes that the scalar - field energy is extracted and thermalized by instant preheating . in preheating @xcite ,",
    "particles are produced when the inflaton passes through a nonadiabatic phase around the minimum of the inflaton potential .",
    "in `` instant '' preheating @xcite , the inflaton is strongly coupled to a particle whose mass depends on the value of the inflaton field .",
    "this particle can be either a boson @xcite or a fermion @xcite ; in our model we will assume it is a boson .",
    "as the inflaton oscillates , the coupling of the inflaton to the produced particle results in an increasing mass of the produced particle . as the mass of the produced particle increases , its decay rate will also increase , and decay channels disallowed when the produced particle is at the minimum of its potential may open .",
    "we will take advantage of both these properties .",
    "in our model we will assume that the inflaton couples to the standard - model higgs boson , @xmath1 , associated with electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we will also assume that , as expected , @xmath1 couples to the @xmath0 .",
    "normally the mass of the higgs , @xmath2 , is much , much less than the mass of the @xmath0 , @xmath3 .",
    "however , during instant preheating this need not be the case , and the higgs may decay directly into @xmath0 , producing a lepton asymmetry . later when the inflaton is close to its minimum , the produced @xmath0s become heavier than the higgs , and they will decay back to the higgs .",
    "let us elaborate on this picture .",
    "we will assume that the temperature , @xmath4 , is always less than the mass of the @xmath0 throughout the entire preheating stage .",
    "the mass of the higgs will be determined by its coupling to the inflaton @xmath5 : @xmath6 .",
    "for sufficiently large values of @xmath7 during the inflaton oscillations , @xmath2 will be larger than @xmath3 .",
    "we will denote the absolute value of @xmath5 when @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "it is useful to imagine a single oscillation of the inflaton field , in particular the first oscillation . as @xmath5 passes near its minimum , @xmath1 is effectively massless , and a burst of @xmath1s",
    "are created .",
    "the @xmath1s will decay to any kinematically allowed final states . because of the large @xmath1top - quark coupling , the decay is predominately into top quarks .",
    "@xmath10 becomes kinematically allowed when @xmath7 becomes larger than @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , efficient lepton number production happens when @xmath9 is close to the minimum so @xmath10 process takes place before all the @xmath1 decays thermally into top quarks . in the case of hierarchical @xmath0s , where @xmath11 , @xmath1s decay while @xmath12 due to the large @xmath1top - quark coupling",
    "this process is nonthermal , as @xmath13 at this time .",
    "eventually @xmath5 reaches a maximum point @xmath14 and rolls back down .",
    "the decay of the @xmath1 continues until @xmath15 . at this stage",
    ", @xmath16 decay happens , and @xmath1s continue to decay into fermions .",
    "a lepton asymmetry is generated by both @xmath10 and @xmath16 decays .",
    "another burst of @xmath1s are produced as @xmath5 passes again through the nonadiabatic phase at the origin , and the same events occur on the other side of the potential .",
    "since @xmath1 decays very rapidly , a negligible amount of @xmath1s remain when @xmath5 repasses through the nonadiabatic regime to produce more @xmath1s .",
    "this eliminates the influence of the old @xmath1s with @xmath5 during production of new @xmath1s , and the backreaction of higgs in the nonadiabatic region need not be considered .",
    "the production and decay of @xmath1s siphon away energy from @xmath5 , and @xmath17 decreases for each oscillation .",
    "a schematic diagram of the regions of the potential in instant preheating is shown in fig .  [ cartoon ] .",
    "s are created . in regions of @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath10 decay occurs . in regions of @xmath19 ( modulo the nonadiabatic region ) ,",
    "@xmath16 decay occurs .",
    "the regions are not drawn to scale.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    there have been many models of leptogenesis .",
    "a hallmark of our model is the economy of fields .",
    "the only undiscovered fields are the inflaton , @xmath5 , the standard model higgs , @xmath1 , and the right - handed neutrino , @xmath0 .",
    "there are very good reasons for suspecting that all exist !",
    "the only unfamiliar aspect of our model is the strong coupling of the inflaton field to the higgs field .",
    "while there is no reason to preclude such a coupling , it would be very interesting to find particle - physics models with a motivation for the coupling .    in the next section we present the lagrangian used in our calculation , we parameterize the nonadiabatic creation of particles in preheating , and we discuss the decay rates and cp violation parameters . in section",
    "iii we present and solve the boltzmann equations used in the calculation , presenting the main results in the form of figures .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "inflation ends in the hybrid model when @xmath5 meets a `` waterfall '' potential in another direction of the scalar field landscape .",
    "the @xmath5 promptly falls into this potential which is responsible for preheating .",
    "hence , @xmath5 does not carry restrictions on potential parameters ( such as the mass ) deduced from present cosmological observations .",
    "for instance , the mass of the @xmath5 during the preheating process may be more massive than the mass of the @xmath5 during inflation .",
    "we assume @xmath5 is coupled to the standard model higgs @xmath1 , with interaction lagrangian @xcite of the preheat field given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the coupling constant . ignoring its electroweak - scale mass , @xmath22 .",
    "we define @xmath23 .",
    "thus , depending on the initial condition of the @xmath5 field , @xmath2 may become larger or smaller than @xmath3 as @xmath5 oscillates about the minimum of its potential .",
    "the inflaton ",
    "higgs coupling leads to a potential of @xmath5 about the minimum in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath5 mass .",
    "the hartree approximation will be used to take the average value of @xmath26 @xcite , where we approximate @xmath27 .",
    "of course @xmath26 is formally infinite , but becomes @xmath28 after renormalization .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath5 becomes @xmath29 where the dot stands for the time derivative , @xmath30 is the hubble expansion parameter , and @xmath31 is the scale factor .",
    "the @xmath1s are created when @xmath5 goes through a nonadiabatic phase , which occurs near the minimum of the potential @xcite .",
    "this phase is very short and can be treated as instantaneous .",
    "the number density of @xmath1s created in the nonadiabatic phase is @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the initial time derivative of @xmath5 , and @xmath34 is the momentum .",
    "a large coupling constant @xmath35 enables a quick and effective thermalization of the universe within a few oscillations of @xmath5 .",
    "the see - saw mechanism lagrangian for three families with majorana neutrino masses @xmath36 ( @xmath37 1 , 2 , 3 ) and yukawa couplings @xmath38 to the higgs and light neutrinos @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 the left - handed light neutrino masses are @xmath41 , where @xmath42 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "@xmath43 also generates a dimension-5 effective operator which causes cp violation among the leptons . throughout the paper we consider the case of hierarchical majorana neutrinos , @xmath44 .",
    "hence the cp asymmetry is created during @xmath45 .",
    "this mass hierarchy allows us to consider only interactions involving @xmath46 ; hence we will drop the family subscript unless distinction between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is required .",

    "are possible in our model : the former process happening when @xmath50 ( _ i.e. , _ when @xmath51 ) , and the latter happening for @xmath52 ( _ i.e. , _ for @xmath53 ) .",
