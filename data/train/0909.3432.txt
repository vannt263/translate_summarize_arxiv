    "graphene is an hexagonally coordinated semi - metallic or zero - gap - semiconducting carbon layer that crystallizes in @xmath0 structure .",
    "its unusual band structure @xcite leads to unique electronic properties such as high charge carrier mobility @xcite and tunable electron band gap by external electromagnetic fields @xcite or by chemical doping.@xcite these make graphene an ideal candidate for a number of applications in nanoelectronics.@xcite recently , it has been shown by electrostatic force microscopy experiments that electric charges can be stored in carbon nanotubes for a period of time.@xcite it would not be surprising if graphene exhibits similar properties , because of the large similarity in its atomic structures to that of nanotubes.@xcite the investigation on electronic properties of graphene doped with net charges is of importance for understanding the charge impurities @xcite or chemical doping @xcite in graphene , and may as well lead to further applications in charge storages,@xcite sensors @xcite and field - emission devices @xcite based on graphene .",
    "the question about the exact solution to the charge distribution in an arbitrary - shaped conducting surface has been raised since the theoretical basis of electromagnetism was established by j. c. maxwell in 1873.@xcite for graphene , the electrostatic problem of finding the charge distribution on the surface of a conducting , rectangular plate requires the solution to laplace s equation in the three - dimensional geometry .",
    "unfortunately , even such a seemingly simple problem has no exact solution : the number of exact solutions in three - dimensions is still limited to specialized geometries that exhibit a great deal of symmetry@xcite . in this paper",
    ", the charge distribution was first calculated using a numerical atomic charge - dipole model .",
    "comparisons are then made between the result of a simple , one - term variational approximation and a numerical solution , which is found to give a more accurate description of the edge atoms .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "( [ sec2 ] ) we describe first our numerical method and then we demonstrate a variational approach to solve laplace s equation and calculate the charge distribution on a conducting rectangular plate .",
    "the results of both numerical and analytical models are compared and discussed in sec .",

    "we draw a conclusion in sec .",

    "mathematical details of the one - term variational approximation are summarized in the appendix .",
    "in this work , the charge density was first calculated using a computational atomic charge - dipole model,@xcite in which each atom is modeled as a polarizable sphere with a net charge @xmath1 and an induced dipole @xmath2 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of the charges and the induced dipoles in graphene is determined by minimizing the total electrostatic potential energy of the system    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the electron affinity , and where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the external potential and electric field , respectively .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) yields    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the lagrange multiplier which is related to the chemical potential of the molecule .",
    "this numerical model is an extension of the atomic dipole interaction theories @xcite .",
    "it has recently been parameterized for @xmath12 carbon systems @xcite and validated through electrostatic force microscopy charge injection experiments.@xcite the graphene structure is relaxed by means of an atomic energy - optimization method using the adaptive interatomic reactive empirical bond order ( airebo ) potential function,@xcite which has specially been parameterized for @xmath12 hydrocarbon systems.@xcite      a simple analytical approximation for the solution to laplace s equation is now constructed . in three physical dimensions ,",
    "consider an infinitesimally thin conducting surface of rectangular shape @xmath13-by-@xmath14 that is held to the potential @xmath15 , with the reference or zero potential at infinity .",
    "the rectangle lies in the @xmath16 plane and is the region @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we seek a solution to laplace s equation @xmath19 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath20    based on experience with the exact solution for the two - dimensional strip problem,@xcite we propose a one - term approximation for the ( scaled ) charge density @xmath21 where the single unknown is the constant @xmath22 .",
    "this functional form is simply a factorization of the rectangular distribution into two edge - condition forms that apply to the classical two - dimensional strip problem .",
    "its suitability is not a priori known , but ultimate comparison with independent moment method @xcite calculations shows that it is quite respectable .",
    "the one - term galerkin procedure in the appendix produces an approximation for the constant @xmath23 in terms of an integral function @xmath24 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ana17 ] ) which is evaluated numerically .",

    "in addition to the surface charge distribution , it is instructive to also consider the capacitance @xmath27 , a global electrostatic characterization of the plate . in the present notation ,",
    "the capacitance per unit width is @xmath28 in the limiting case of a square , @xmath29 and the numerics give @xmath30 and the subsequent normalized capacitance is ( in si units ) @xmath31(pf / m ) , about 1.6% lower than the value @xmath32(pf / m ) that has been published by goto _ _",

    "as expected , typical charge and electric field enhancement effects @xcite were observed near the corners and the edges . to compare these results with those predicted by eq .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) shows a general agreement between the analytical model and the numerical calculation .",
    "the lack of smooth trend of the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) is due to the different configurations of atoms at armchair and zigzag edges and the discontinuity of our discrete model .",
    "it is found that the eq .",
    "( [ eq : ana19 ] ) becomes no more accurate for the atoms near the edges , because the assumption of infinitely sharp edges in the analytical solution is not valid in atomic scale .",
    "after our simulation results , the charge density ( at the corner ) can be enhanced up to @xmath33 times over that in the center of graphene .",
    "we note that the charge density can also slightly vary if the graphene is substitutionally doped by net charges ( e.g. some electrons per 100 atoms ) , since the graphene band structure can be significantly modified in highly charged graphene.@xcite moreover , these results also imply that the influence of induced dipoles on the charge distribution is minor .",
    "we next consider the size effect on the charge distribution .",
    "our results show a strong dependence of the charge enhancement on the graphene length @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we can see that the fluctuation of the charge profile due to the edge state becomes less significant with the increasing length , and that the charge enhancement at the edges is stronger for the longer sheets .",
    "this behavior is similar to that in carbon nanotubes.@xcite    we now define the maximal charge enhancement ratio @xmath34 as the maximal atomic charge density normalized to the average over the whole graphene .",
    "it is one of the key parameters for the potential applications of graphene in field emission devices @xcite . to show a complete correlation between @xmath34 and the dimensions of graphene",

    "[ fig:3 ] as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we can see that @xmath34 increases with either @xmath13 or @xmath14 , and that @xmath34 gets higher for @xmath35 .",
    "it is found that the increase of charge enhance ratio is more rapid in small size graphene sheets .      to generalize our results for the graphene size usually used in experiments , it is particularly interesting to investigate the charge distribution in infinitely long graphene sheets or strips . the question of charge distribution becomes a 2d standard problem in elliptical coordinates.@xcite the exact solution to laplace s equation for the strip conductor of width @xmath36 held to the potential @xmath15 gives the surface charge density @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ( large ) radial distance where the potential vanishes .",
    "this is the ground   or reference surface that can not be at infinity because of the logarithmic singularity in the 2d potential problem .",
    "integration of the surface charge density yields the capacitance per unit length @xmath39 here we show the normalized charge profile in a graphene sheet with applied periodic condition in width ( @xmath40 ) direction in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , which highlights a good agreement obtained between the numerical calculations and the analytical solution . also , compared to fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , it can be seen that the fluctuation on the charge density curves due to the open - edge effects @xcite completely disappeared in the infinite - long graphene.@xcite    to demonstrate the size effect , we now consider the maximal charge enhancement ratio @xmath34 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] that @xmath34 increases with @xmath13 , the shape of the @xmath41 curve is as predicted by the logarithm relationship proposed by keblinski _",
    "since the surface electric potential is a constant , this length dependence directly leads to the rise of the capacitance @xmath42 of the edge atoms . also , we plot the normalized @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath42 also increases with @xmath13 , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ana23 ] ) .",
    "however , it is found that the capacitance per unit length decreases with @xmath13 .",
    "this behavior indicates an electric potential loss when the graphene sheet gets shorter , i.e. , the longer graphene exhibits a higher surface potential to keep the net charges inside .",
    "multi - layered graphene sheets have also been studied in this work .",
    "they have been reported to have interesting electronic properties.@xcite we investigated multi - layered graphene in which each layer contains the same quantity of net charges . due to the electrostatic interaction between the layers , the charge profile in multi - layered graphene",
    "can not be assumed to be a simple addition of that of a single layer . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , we plot the profile of net charges in a 4-layered graphene to compare with that in a single - layered one with the same size .",
    "it can be seen that the charge enhancement is more significant in multi - layered graphene .",
    "the mechanism of this behavior relies on the electrostatic repulsive effects between the carbon layers , which can effectively reduce the capacitance of the atoms at the center of graphene and can however enhance that of the edge atoms.@xcite    we now estimate the charge enhancement ratio in multi - layered graphene as a function of the number of layer @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "our results showed that the charge enhancement effect becomes more significant when the number of layer increases , due to the electrostatic repulsive effect between the layers .",
    "we found that @xmath34 roughly follows a linear relationship with @xmath43 .",
    "note that the interlayer distance can be slightly changed in case of a very high charge density,@xcite while we use a constant distance @xmath44 nm in this work.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the charge distribution in graphene , using both a numerical method and an analytical solution to the classical problem of net charges in a rectangular conducting plate in three physical dimensions .",
    "it is found that the analytical model gives a good description to the charge distribution , except for the very edge atoms because of the atomic edge state .",
    "we demonstrated how the charge distribution changes with the increasing graphene length , width and number of layer .",
    "the length dependence of the charge enhancement effect was found to be related to the rise of graphene capacitance with increasing size .",
    "the charge enhancement ratio is found to follow a linear relationship with the number of layers in multi - layered graphene .",
