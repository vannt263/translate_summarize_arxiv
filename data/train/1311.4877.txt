    "the precise vlbi mapping of water masers orbiting the central black hole in ngc4258 makes it possible to measure a geometrical distance to this spiral galaxy with unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite have refined these measurements using a new model which includes disk warping and confocal elliptical maser orbits with differential precession .",
    "they obtained a distance of 7.60@xmath20.17@xmath20.15mpc , where the uncertainties are split into formal fitting errors and a systematic term respectively .",
    "given such an accurate and precise distance , it is an obvious ( though bold ) step to use this galaxy as a new anchor point for extragalactic distance indicators , such as the cepheid period - luminosity relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* plr ) . after the discovery with hst of a large sample of cepheids by @xcite ,",
    "this galaxy was used by @xcite and @xcite as the first step in an hst survey for cepheids in host galaxies of sne  ia out to 30 mpc , which resulted in a determination of the hubble constant with a total uncertainty of 3.3% .",
    "simultaneously , there has also been a dramatic improvement in the measurement of the distance to the large magellanic cloud . in a long - term project over eight years",
    ", @xcite accumulated photometric and spectroscopic observations of long - period , well - detached late - type eclipsing binaries to construct high - precision light and radial velocity curves of eight systems distributed along the line of nodes towards the lmc .",
    "the analysis of this unique observational material provided radius , extinction , luminosity and distance for each object resulting in a lmc distance with an unprecedented accuracy of 2% .    combining the lmc and ngc4258 as two anchor points of the extragalactic distance scale",
    "has the potential to further increase the robustness of the determination of the hubble constant or , at least , to check for additional systematic effects . in the case of the plr ,",
    "hst studies of cepheid fields at different galactocentric radii within spiral galaxies usually show that the variables in inner fields seem to be brighter by a few tenths of a magnitude than those in outer fields .",
    "this is usually interpreted as an effect of the metallicity gradient in spiral galaxies and a metallicity dependence of the plr @xcite .",
    "the cepheids detected in the maser galaxy ngc4258 also show such an effect @xcite . according to these studies",
    ", a difference between solar neighborhood metallicity and lmc metallicity of 0.4 dex will have an effect of 0.12 mag in distance modulus or 6% in distance , clearly too large if the ultimate goal is to measure a hubble constant with a precision of 3% or better to constrain the equation of state of dark energy parameter @xmath3 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . while the interpretation of the physical reason of the brightness difference of inner and outer field cepheids is heavily disputed ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and while this effect might be less pronounced in the near - ir h - band used by @xcite",
    ", it is very evident that a precise determination of distances using cepheids should be accompanied by an accurate determination of stellar metallicities .     ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at distances significantly beyond the magellanic clouds , a direct determination of the metallicity of cepheids based on spectroscopy is not possible . instead",
    ", the work on the extragalactic distance scale cited above has used the oxygen abundance obtained from the strong emission lines of  regions as a proxy for stellar metallicities .",
    "however , it has been shown over the last years ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a detailed discussion ) that these `` strong - line methods '' are subject to systematic uncertainties as large as 0.6 dex , which are poorly understood and can severely affect the inferred values of galaxy central metallicities and abundance gradients .",
    "this introduces an element of uncertainty in the use of cepheids as extragalactic distance indicators , in particular , with the goal to obtain very accurate distances .",
    "the important case of the maser galaxy is an illustrative example for this uncertainty .",
    "@xcite used oxygen abundances obtained from  region strong line studies by @xcite for their discussion of cepheid metallicity in ngc4258 . these studies claim a very high central value of [ o / h]=12+log(o / h)=9.17 and a rather steep gradient of -0.028 . on the other hand , the study by @xcite included four  regions with observations of the weak auroral [ oiii ] 4363 line , and determined a much lower central metallicity value of [ o / h]=8.49 and a significantly shallower gradient of -0.010  ( all values are taken from @xcite but have been re - normalized to the new maser distance of 7.6 mpc ) . at a galactocentric radius of 8.7kpc ( see below ) this leads to a striking difference in oxygen abundance . using the zaritsky et al .",
    "result we obtain [ o / h]=8.93 , significantly larger than the solar value of [ o / h]=8.69 @xcite , whereas adopting the bresolin result yields [ o / h]=8.40 which is only slightly larger than the lmc value [ o / h]=8.36 ( also based on  regions by @xcite ) . obviously , when discussing cepheid magnitude differences between ngc4258 and the lmc , the question of whether the metallicity difference is 0.5 dex or almost zero is important .    while at the distance of the maser galaxy a direct spectroscopic investigation of cepheid metallicities is not possible to settle this issue",
    ", there is an attractive alternative : the quantitative spectroscopy of blue supergiant stars ( bsgs ) .",
    "bsgs are massive stars in the range between 15 and 40  @xmath4 , which cross the hertzpsrung - russell diagram in @xmath5  yr from the main sequence to the red supergiant stage as stars of spectral type late b or a. having an age of @xmath6 10 million years , they belong to the same population as cepheids albeit they are more massive and slightly younger .",
    "their magnitudes can reach up to @xmath7 , rivaling the integrated brightness of globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "they are more than four magnitudes brighter than cepheids and , thus , perfect candidates for quantitative stellar abundance studies beyond the local group . @xcite",
    "have shown that accurate metallicities based on elements such as iron , chromium , titanium etc . can be determined from low resolution spectroscopy of individual objects using refined nlte model atmosphere diagnostic methods .",
    "this technique has now been applied on a variety of galaxy abundance studies ( wlm  @xcite ; @xcite ; ngc 3109  @xcite , @xcite ; ic 1613  @xcite ; m33  @xcite ; ngc 300  @xcite ; m81 ",

    "the extension of this technique to the maser galaxy is a consequent next step .",
    "so far the most distant galaxy studied in the this way has been m81 with a distance of 3.5  mpc .",
    "investigating bsgs in ngc4258 doubles the range in distance , which is a clear challenge pushing the method to a new limit .",
    "we have , thus , started a pilot project of multi - object spectroscopy of bsgs in this key galaxy for the extragalactic distance scale . in this paper , we present a first result , the direct determination of the metallicity of one bsg in ngc4258 at a galactocentric distance of 8.7kpc .",

    "the sum is extended over all spectral windows and n@xmath29 is the sum of all pixel in all spectral windows .",

    "our analysis uses hydrostatic model atmospheres .",
    "this raises the question whether the abundance determination could be affected by a stellar wind .",
    "the effective temperature and gravity resulting from the analysis put the star relatively close to the eddington - limit .",
    "as a consequence , it may have a strong stellar wind as known from other a - supergiants with similar stellar parameters @xcite .",
    "however , detailed metal abundance studies using high spectral resulution and high s / n spectra of these objects have shown that their photospheric metal lines and the resulting abundances are not influenced by the outer atmosphere effects of stellar winds ( przybilla et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "thus , while our low resolution spectra with the strongest balmer lines h@xmath32 contaminated by  emission do not allow to constrain the strength of the wind ( note that objects of this type have low wind speeds of about 200 km / s only ) , we conclude that stellar wind effects are unlikely to affect our metallicity determination .",
    "we can use the stellar parameters obtained in this way to calculate the intrinsic b - v and v - i colors of the bsg to determine the reddening .",
    "we obtain e(b - v)=0.20  mag and e(v - i)=0.34  mag . with e(b - v)=0.78e(v - i ) , we get e(b - v)=0.26  mag for the e(v - i ) value determined . thus , we adopt e(b - v)=0.23@xmath20.03  mag for the reddening and with r@xmath33=3.2 calculate a@xmath33=0.73@xmath20.10  mag for the extinction . with the distance modulus of m - m@xmath34  mag to ngc4258 and a bolometric correction from the model calculations of bc=-0.006  mag we finally obtain m@xmath33=m@xmath35=-9.55@xmath20.12  mag for the visual and bolometric magnitudes , respectively .",

    "the result is encouraging . while the object lies somewhat above the calibration relationship it is still within the observed scatter .",
    "moreover , at the high luminosity end there is the prediction by stellar evolution theory of a possible curvature of the fglr , for which we may already see an indication in the data observed ( for a more detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , this needs to be investigated by adding more bsgs belonging to ngc4258 to the plot and by fitting a distance with less luminous objects .",
    "this work is presently under way .",
    "in our spectroscopic analysis of a bsg at a galactocentric distance of 8.7kpc we have found a stellar metallicity of -0.2 dex relative to the solar value . given the uncertainty of 0.1 dex , this is in reasonable agreement with the recent  region work by @xcite which obtained a value of @xmath43dex relative to solar at this galactocentric distance .",
    "while this is only the study of one object , it is already a strong confirmation that the stellar metallicity of the young population in the disk of ngc4258 is very similar to that of the lmc , for which @xcite have found an average value of [ z]@xmath44=-0.33 from a spectroscopic analysis of cepheid variables ( in perfect agreement with the  region value of @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , only by a study of a larger sample of bsgs in ngc4258 covering a range of galactocentric distances will we be able to confirm whether the metallicity gradient is as shallow as found by @xcite and the average metallicity clearly lower than solar .",
    "this work is presently under way .",

    "<S> we present the first direct determination of a stellar metallicity in the spiral galaxy ngc4258 ( @xmath0mpc ) based on the quantitative analysis of a low - resolution ( @xmath1  ) keck lris spectrum of a blue supergiant star located in its disk . </S>",
    "<S> a determination of stellar metallicity in this galaxy is important for the absolute calibration of the cepheid period - luminosity relation as an anchor for the extragalactic distance scale and for a better characterization of its dependence as a function of abundance . </S>",
    "<S> we find a value 0.2 dex lower than solar metallicity at a galactocentric distance of 8.7kpc , in agreement with recent  region studies using the weak forbidden auroral oxygen line at 4363   . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the effective stellar temperature , gravity , luminosity and line - of - sight extinction of the blue supergiant being studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it fits well on the flux - weighted gravity  </S>",
    "<S> luminosity relation ( fglr ) , strengthening the potential of this method as a new extragalactic distance indicator . </S>"
