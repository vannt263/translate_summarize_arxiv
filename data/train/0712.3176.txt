    "the structure of the irreducible linear representations of the ( [ nsusyalgebra ] ) superalgebra has been substantially elucidated in recent years . on the other hand ,",
    "some open questions remain .",
    "this paper addresses and solves one of these issues .    in this introduction",
    "we briefly recall the state of the art concerning the irreducible linear representations of ( [ nsusyalgebra ] ) and explain this paper s results .",
    "we postpone to the conclusions all discussions on their relevance and their possible applications .",
    "we recall that the irreducible linear representations we are interested in ( the irreducible supermultiplets ) are given by a finite number of fields , bosonic and fermionic , depending on a single coordinate @xmath13 ( the time ) .",
    "the generator @xmath10 is represented by the time - derivative , while the @xmath8 s generators are linear operators ( matrices ) whose entries are either @xmath14-numbers or time - derivatives up to a certain power .",
    "the program of classifying such irreducible supermultiplets starts with @xcite , whose main results can be stated as follows . all irreducible representations of ( [ nsusyalgebra ] ) , for a given @xmath1 , are obtained by applying a dressing transformation to a fundamental irreducible representation ( nowadays called in the literature the  root multiplet \" ) , with equal number of bosonic and fermionic fields .",
    "the root multiplet is specified by an associated clifford algebra . as a corollary ,",
    "the total number @xmath15 of bosonic fields entering an irreducible representation ( which equals the total number of fermionic fields ) is expressed , for any given @xmath1 , by the following relation @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 appearing in ( [ irrepdim ] ) is the radon - hurwitz function @xmath20    a mass - dimension @xmath12 can be assigned to any field entering a linear representation ( the hamiltonian @xmath10 has a mass - dimension @xmath21 ) .",
    "bosonic ( fermionic ) fields have integer ( respectively , half - integer ) mass - dimension .",

    "physically , the @xmath27 fields of highest dimension are the auxiliary fields which transform as a time - derivative under any supersymmetry generator . the maximal value @xmath28 ( corresponding to the maximal dimensionality @xmath29 ) is defined to be the length of the representation ( a root representation has length @xmath30 ) . either @xmath31 correspond to the bosonic fields ( therefore @xmath32 specify the fermionic fields ) or viceversa . in both cases",

    "a graphical presentation of the supersymmetry transformations was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it was later pointed out in @xcite and @xcite ( some specific @xmath38 examples were given ) that the fields contents alone do not necessarily uniquely specify the finite linear irreducible representations of ( [ nsusyalgebra ] ) .",
    "this result was based on a notion of class of equivalence of the irreducible representations of the @xmath7 @xmath1-extended superalgebra motivated by the set of moves acting on its graphical presentations ( see also the comments in @xcite ) .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we classified , up to @xmath39 , all inequivalent irreducible representations admitting the same fields content but differing in connectivity of their associated graphs .",
    "the notion of connectivity , describing how vertices and edges are linked together , was made precise by the introduction of the so - called @xmath40 symbol , whose definition will be recalled in the next section .",
    "a particular consequence of the @xcite results is that , up to @xmath39 , inequivalent connectivities are only encountered for @xmath38 .    in @xcite no attempt was made to explain the motivation of the found results . in this paper",

    "we could have easily thought that the different decompositions into @xmath4 supermultiplets ( which can also be described , in the superfield language , as different decompositions in terms of @xmath4 superfields ) would produce equivalent results .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the analysis of the connectivity proves their inequivalence .",
    "conversely , the whole list of @xmath2 inequivalent connectivities is completely specified by the inequivalent @xmath4 decompositions .",
    "this result opens the way to extend the analysis of the inequivalent connectivities to the @xmath3 irreducible supermultiplets .",
    "the reason is simple .",
    "they are constructed in terms of two irreducible @xmath5 supermultiplets and an extra supersymmetry transformation connecting them .",
    "the complete list of @xmath3 inequivalent connectivities is reported in section * 4*. we further analyze the inequivalent connectivities of some @xmath43 irreducible supermultiplets which can be obtained from two irreducible @xmath3 supermultiplets linked together by an extra supersymmetry .",
    "the results of this paper are further complemented by the presentation of the  oxidation diagrams \" which provide the following information .",
    "the irreducible @xmath6 supermultiplets admit the same number of fields .",
    "an oxidation diagram describes whether an @xmath2 irreducible representation can be lifted (  oxidized \" ) to an @xmath44 ( and to which @xmath44 , in the case of fields contents with inequivalent connectivities ) , an @xmath45 or an @xmath5 irreducible representation .",

    "some comments are made on various applications of these results .",
    "the paper is integrated by @xmath50 figures , two of them graphically depicting an example of decomposition of the supersymmetry transformations , while the three remaining ones present oxidation diagrams .",
    "some technical issues which will be used for later computations ( e.g. the dressing transformations which progressively lengthen the irreducible supermultiplets , the constraints that they have to satisfy , etc . )",
    "have been discussed at length in @xcite and @xcite . to save space , they will not be repeated here .    in this section",

    "each one of the @xmath1 @xmath8 supersymmetry generators is associated to a given color .",
    "the edges are oriented .",
    "the orientation reflects the sign ( positive or negative ) of the corresponding supersymmetry transformation connecting the two vertices . instead of using arrows , alternatively",
    ", solid or dashed lines can be associated , respectively , to positive or negative signs .",
    "no colored line is drawn for supersymmetry transformations connecting a field with the time - derivative of a lower dimensional field .",
    "this is in particular true for the auxiliary fields ( the fields of highest dimension in the representation ) which are necessarily mapped , under supersymmetry transformations , in the time - derivative of lower - dimensional fields .",
    "each irreducible supersymmetry transformation can be presented ( the identification is not unique ) through an oriented @xmath1-colored graph with @xmath54 vertices ( see ( [ irrepdim ] ) ) .",
    "the graph is such that precisely @xmath1 edges , one for each color , are linked to any given vertex which represents either a @xmath55-mass dimension or a @xmath56-mass dimension field .    despite the fact that the presentation of the graph is not unique , certain of its features",
    "only depend on the class of the supersymmetry transformations .",
    "we introduce now , following @xcite , the invariant characterization .",
    "an unoriented  color - blind \" graph can be associated to the initial graph by disregarding the orientation of the edges and their colors ( all edges are painted in black ) . for simplicity , we discuss here the invariant characterization of the graphs associated to the length @xmath57 irreducible representation that will be discussed in the following ( the generalization of the invariant characterization to graphs of arbitrary length is straightforward , see @xcite ) .",
