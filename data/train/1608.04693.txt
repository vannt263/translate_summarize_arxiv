    "<S> we report on the single - atom - resolved measurement of the distribution of momenta @xmath0 in a weakly - interacting bose gas after a 330 ms time - of - flight . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate it for various temperatures and clearly separate two contributions to the depletion of the condensate by their @xmath1-dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the thermal depletion . </S>",
    "<S> the second contribution falls off as @xmath2 , and its magnitude increases with the in - trap condensate density as predicted by the bogoliubov theory at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest associating it with the quantum depletion . </S>",
    "<S> how this contribution can survive the expansion of the released interacting condensate is an intriguing open question .    in quantum systems , intriguing many - body phenomena emerge from the interplay between quantum fluctuations and interactions . </S>",
    "<S> quantum depletion is an emblematic example of such an effect , occurring in one of the simplest many - body systems : a gas of interacting bosons at zero temperature . in the absence of interactions </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state corresponds to all particles occupying the same single - particle state . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account inter - particle repulsive interactions at the mean - field level leads to a similar solution where all particles are condensed in the same one - particle state whose shape is determined by the trapping potential and interactions . in a beyond mean - field approach , which can be interpreted as taking into account quantum fluctuations and two - body interactions , the description is dramatically different . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body ground state consists of several components : a macroscopically occupied single - particle state , the condensate , and a population of single - particle states different from the condensate , the depletion .    </S>",
    "<S> this many - body description applies to diverse bosonic systems such as superfluid helium @xcite , exciton - polaritons @xcite and degenerate bose gases @xcite ; it has also found analogies in phenomena such as hawking radiation from a black - hole @xcite and spontaneous parametric down conversion in optics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of atoms not in the condensate at zero temperature , the quantum depletion , increases with the strength of inter - particle interactions and with the density , rising up to 90% in liquid @xmath3he @xcite . in ultracold gases , where the density is significantly smaller </S>",
    "<S> , the quantum depletion usually represents a small fraction ( less than 1% ) of the total population . at non - zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> there is an additional contribution to the population of single - particle states above the condensate , originating from the presence of thermal fluctuations .    for weakly interacting systems , bogoliubov theory describes quantum and thermal contributions to the condensate depletion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach shows that the elementary , low - energy excitations are collective quasi - particle ( phonon ) modes , as has been verified in experimental studies with liquid @xmath3he @xcite , degenerate quantum gases @xcite and exciton - polaritons @xcite . at zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> , the many - body ground state is defined as a vacuum of these quasi - particle modes . when projected onto a basis of single - particle states with momentum @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , this many - body ground state exhibits a distribution @xmath4 , which scales as @xmath2 at large @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these power law tails do not exist in mean - field descriptions , for which the momentum distribution has a finite extent . at non zero temperature , the contribution to @xmath4 induced by thermal fluctuations decays exponentially for energies larger than the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> previous experiments with atomic gases @xcite have observed the total depletion of the condensate after a time - of - flight expansion , but could not distinguish between the thermal and quantum contributions .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we report on the observation of momentum - space signatures of thermal and quantum depletion in a gas of interacting bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , for various temperatures and atomic densities , the three - dimensional atomic distribution after a long time - of - flight ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the asymptotic momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> three components can be identified ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) : the condensate ( * i * ) , the thermal depletion ( * ii * ) and a tail decaying as @xmath2 and increasing with the in - trap condensate density ( * iii * ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests associating region * iii * with the quantum depletion , but with two caveats . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , @xmath2-tails originated from contact interaction were observed to vanish during the expansion of interacting fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical work investigating interacting bosons predicts that the @xmath2-tails adiabatically decrease with the condensate density during the expansion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the magnitude of the @xmath2-tails we measure is larger than the in - trap prediction of the bogoliubov theory , by a factor of about 6 . </S>",
    "<S> our identification of the @xmath2-tail with the quantum depletion thus demands that there exists either a non - adiabatic process in the expansion , decoupling the in - trap @xmath2 component from the expanding condensate , or an interaction - induced effect beyond the mean - field description of the expansion , leading to 1/@xmath5 tails .     </S>",
    "<S> after a 330 ms time - of - flight . </S>",
    "<S> the central dense part corresponds to the condensate while the isolated dots are excited particles outside of the condensate wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> also shown are the 2d projections , highlighting the condensate anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ]    our experiment is performed with a bose - einstein condensate of metastable helium-4 atoms ( @xmath3he@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> cigar - shaped condensates , of typically @xmath7 @xmath3he@xmath6 atoms in the polarized @xmath8 , @xmath9 state are produced in an optical dipole trap with trapping frequencies @xmath10 hz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after abruptly turning off the optical trap ( in less than @xmath11 ) we detect the gas with a micro - channel plate ( mcp ) @xcite , after a 55 cm free - fall corresponding to a time - of - flight ( tof ) of @xmath12 ms . a radio - frequency </S>",
    "<S> ( rf ) ramp transfers a fraction of the polarized @xmath9 atoms to the non - magnetic @xmath13 state after 2 ms of tof ( see @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a magnetic gradient after the rf ramp ensures that only @xmath13 atoms fall onto the mcp and can be detected . </S>",
    "<S> the mcp allows us to detect @xmath3he@xmath6 atoms individually and to record the two - dimensional ( 2d ) position and the arrival time of each atom in the plane of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the arrival time of each atom directly translates into a vertical coordinate , so that we reconstruct the complete 3d atoms distribution , in contrast with usual optical imaging which yields a 2d column - integrated density . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of a mcp operated in counting mode is its extremely low dark count rate . here </S>",
    "<S> it allows us to investigate the atomic density over more than 5 decades ( see below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the detector is placed 55 cm below the trapped cloud ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) , so that after switching off the trap , the observation is made in the far - field regime where finite - size effects of the source can be safely neglected . in the free - falling frame of reference , we thus identify the position @xmath14 of a detected atom ( with respect to the cloud center ) with a momentum component @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ms is the time - of - flight of the cloud center @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this yields the asymptotic momentum distribution @xmath17 obtained from the density distribution of the expanding cloud @xmath18 , according to the ballistic relationship @xmath19 the distribution @xmath17 should not be confused with the in - trap momentum distribution @xmath20 , since the initial phase of the expansion is affected by inter - atomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as we argue below , the high - momentum tails of @xmath17 provide interesting information on the in - trap momentum distribution @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> an example of @xmath21 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main component is the pancake - shaped distribution expected for the cigar - shaped condensate according to the mean - field description of the expansion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also distinguish momentum components beyond those of the condensate , with a much lower density and an isotropic distribution @xcite . from 3d distributions @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain radial and longitudinal profiles as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting profiles exhibit three distinct regions , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the observed distributions are dominated by the high - density condensate ( region * i * : @xmath22 @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial expansion of the condensate is driven by inter - particle interactions , resulting in an asymptotic distribution different from the in - trap momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamics is fully captured by a mean - field treatment , the scaling solution @xcite calculated in the thomas fermi approximation , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> solid lines are a smoothed average of the density data , and the lightly shaded band is the running standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> the dark count rate corresponds to a level less than @xmath27m@xmath28 , which is one order of magnitude below the lowest data point . </S>",
    "<S> the plotted range of momenta is limited by the physical size of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ]    beyond the anisotropic mean - field distribution we observe high - momentum tails ( @xmath29 ) with spherical symmetry @xcite : we attribute these components ( regions * ii * and * iii * in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) ) to the depletion of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the _ isotropic _ </S>",
    "<S> character of the atomic distribution in the tails indicates that the _ anisotropic _ mean - field potential describing the interactions in the condensate does not play a significant role in the expansion of particles belonging to regions * ii * and * iii*. thus we assume in the following that the high - momentum components of the tails , corresponding to a kinetic energy larger than the chemical potential of the condensate , quickly escape the condensate and are not affected by the mean - field potential during the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the tails are visible over three decades in density , allowing us to perform a detailed study of their momentum dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we observe two distinct regions : a middle region without a well - defined power - law variation ( region * ii * ) , and a high - momentum region with density varying as @xmath30 ( region * iii * ) . </S>",
    "<S> a power - law fit to the data in region * iii * yields @xmath31 .    a quantitative description of the condensate depletion close to zero temperature is provided by bogoliubov s microscopic theory , which yields a beyond mean - field model taking into account quantum and thermal excitations @xcite . in the many - body hamiltonian , this approximated approach retains only quadratic terms in the particle operators @xmath32 , where @xmath32 is the operator annihilating a particle with momentum @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplified hamiltonian can then be diagonalized by introducing the quasi - particle operators @xmath33 defined by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath34 @xcite .    at zero temperature , the many - body ground state is the vacuum of quasi - particles , defined as @xmath35 for any @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it corresponds to a non - zero population of excited single - particle states , @xmath37 for @xmath36 . </S>",
