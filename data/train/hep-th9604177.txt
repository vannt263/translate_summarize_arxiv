    "recently there has been much interest in the role of bogomolnyi saturated states corresponding to extreme black holes in string theory .",
    "one particularly interesting suggestion is that at special points of the moduli space of string vacua these states may become massless and the theory might thereby exhibit enhanced symmetry @xcite .",
    "another related suggestion is that these states might appear at points in the space of calabi - yau vacua associated to singular geometries with conifold points @xcite .",
    "away from these special points there is a region of moduli space where these bogomolnyi black hole states are well described semi - classically by classical solutions of the einstein equations coupled to an appropriate matter system , but presumably as one approaches a special point the semi - classical description breaks down .",
    "nevertheless attempts have been made to find classical solutions describing black holes with zero adm mass @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these solutions are supersymmetric , i.e. they admit killing spinors , but they are nakedly singular . by the positive energy theorem for black holes these singularities are inevitable because the matter sources satisfy the dominant energy condition .",
    "this is a pity because there are many questions one would like to ask about the properties of these putative zero - rest mass black holes .",
    "how do they move for instance ?",
    "the solutions given in @xcite-@xcite are static and at rest .",
    "this is not possible for ordinary zero - rest mass particles . what happens if these zero rest mass black holes receive a small kick ?",
    "are they stable ? what happens if one tries to accelerate them using an electric field ?",
    "it is difficult to answer questions like this using singular solutions because the answers one obtains are dependent upon the boundary conditions one imposes at the singularities .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a related but hopefully simpler situation .",
    "consider , to begin with , ordinary electrodynamics",
    ". ignoring a possible theta term , the theory is specified by the maxwell lagrangian - 1 4 e^2 f _ f^ where the electric charge @xmath0 may be said to label the possible vacua .",
    "this is clear in string theory where it is an expectation value e^2 = 2 where @xmath1 is the dilaton .",
    "studying the dependence of theory as a function of the coupling constant @xmath0 is therefore the same as studying the behaviour of the theory as one moves around the moduli space of vacua .",
    "one immediate question is whether various properties of the theory depend analytically upon the coupling constant .",
    "this would be true in a neighbourhood of the origin if perturbation theory in powers of @xmath2 were uniformly convergent .",
    "it was argued long ago by dyson @xcite that this can not be so .",
    "the argument is by contradiction .",
    "if the series converged in this way it would do so everywhere within a small enough disc about the origin .",
    "in particular perturbation theory would converge if @xmath3 were negative .",
    "but in such a world , like charges would attract and they would destablize the vacuum .    in a gravity theory charged black holes , particularly the extreme black holes ,",
    "behave very much like charged particles and so this beautiful argument of dyson suggests looking at what happens to black holes in a world in which , instead of the standard lagrangian ] ( r - f_f^ ) , we change the sign of the electromagnetic contribution and use ( r + f_f^ ) instead .",
    "more generally we could consider a theory with a dynamical scalar @xmath4 . the action would be ( r - 2()^2 + e^-2af_f^ ) , where @xmath5 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "note that the scalar @xmath4 has positive kinetic energy .",
    "if @xmath6 we may consistently set @xmath7 and we get back to the usual einstein - anti - maxwell case . if @xmath8 we get anti - kaluza - klein theory in which the extra dimension is timelike rather than the usual spacelike case .",
    "our results may therefore also be relevant to theories with more than one time direction @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath9 corresponds to string theory .",
    "formally the action above is obtained by setting = + i 2a in the usual action . because this is just a displacement of @xmath4 it leaves the kinetic term unchanged .",
    "it may be of interest to note that lindstrom and rocek have drawn attention to vector fields with negative kinetic energies in yang - mills theories with zero mass monopoles @xcite .",
    "another application of these ideas is to the field outside a fundamental string in four spacetime dimensions @xcite ( or more generally an @xmath10-brane in @xmath11 spacetime dimensions ) .",
    "the dilaton behaves as e^-2 = 1 - 8r where @xmath12 is the radial distance from the core of the string .",
    "note that the @xmath1 used here is twice that used in @xcite . at sufficiently large transverse distances @xmath13",
    "becomes negative which means that the effective string coupling constant becomes pure imaginary .",
    "the metric becomes singular at @xmath14 and so it can not be interpreted in a straightforward way as an ordinary horizon . in the kaluza - klein context a similar phenomenon is encountered and one may have an ordinary horizon in the higher dimensional space because the killing field one is reducing on switches from being spacelike to being timelike .    of course one may , if one wishes , consider a scalar field with negative kinetic energy .",
    "this also produces some exotic solutions even without an electromagnetic field , including an einstein - rosen bridge with @xmath15 and thus no horizon separating the two sides .",
    "this is discussed briefly in section  2.2 and in more detail in section  5 .    in",
    "what follows we shall sometimes use , as we did above , the prefix  anti \" to describe quantities associated to an electromagnetic field of the opposite sign from usual .",
    "thus , in the next section , we will consider black holes with  anti - charge \" .",
    "of course , like anti - charges attract rather than repel , as they do ordinarily .",
    "if we take the conventional sign for the scalar field kinetic term , then it also leads to an attractive force . as we shall see",
    "this means that extreme black holes are not possible in these theories .",
    "moreover none of the solutions we shall discuss admit killing spinors .",
    "another difference is that the solutions are non - singular outside a regular event horizon .",
    "thus the phenomena we are about to describe are not precisely the same as those considered in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however the solutions in this paper do share the common feature with those of @xcite-@xcite that the total 4-momentum vanishes .",
    "it seems quite possible therefore that they may throw some light on the dynamical behaviour of such objects .",
    "the relevant metrics and fields for electrically charged solutions in einstein - anti - maxwell - dilaton theory may be obtained from the usual case @xcite by setting the charge to be pure imaginary .",
    "the four - metric is @xmath16 + r^2 ( 1-r_-r)^2a^21+a^2(d^2 + ^2d ^2 ) , with scalar field e^ = ( 1-r_-r)^a1+a^2 and maxwell field f = qr^2 dtdr . for the _ magnetic _ case",
    "the metric is the same but the sign of the scalar field @xmath4 must be reversed and the maxwell field becomes @xmath17 .",
    "the adm mass @xmath18 is m= 1 2 ( r_+ + 1-a^21+a^2r_- ) and the anticharge @xmath19 is given by |q| = .",
    "the scalar charge @xmath20 is given by = - ar_-1+a^2 , thus m^2 + ^2 + q^2 = 14 ( r_+-r_-)^2 .    from the spacetime point of view",
    "these solutions will have a regular event horizon at @xmath21 and behave like black holes provided that @xmath22 is positive and @xmath23 is _ negative _ ( the usual case has both positive but with @xmath24 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath23 would be a cauchy horizon , or more generally it is a singularity , but because @xmath23 is negative one passes through the horizon @xmath22 to reach the singularity at @xmath25 without ever reaching @xmath23 .",
    "the causal structure is thus the same as the schwarzschild solution .",
    "for the same reason there are no extreme holes .",
    "one may also check that one can not analytically continue the usual multi - solutions to have imaginary values of the charge , and so anti - gravity is excluded .",
    "and electric charges of _ opposite _ signs should be able to remain in a static equilibrium since unlike charges repel in this theory .",
    "it is obvious , however , that such a static equilibrium is not possible for more than 2 black holes , since they can not all have charges of different signs from one another , and so this is not true anti - gravity . ]",
    "the behaviour of the solutions depends in an essential way on whether @xmath26 is less or greater than unity . in the former case we may , by taking @xmath27 sufficiently negative , violate the positive mass theorem .",
    "in fact , by choosing r_+ = a^2 - 11+a^2r_- , we can obtain a solution with vanishing total adm mass .",
    "one may ask what happens if @xmath12 is allowed to be negative .",
    "one then has an asymptotically flat spacetime with negative adm mass containing a naked singularity at @xmath28 .",
    "by contrast if @xmath29 and @xmath12 is positive then the adm mass @xmath18 is always positive .",
    "an explanation for this fact is presumably that the larger the coupling constant @xmath5 , the greater is the positive contribution of the scalar field to the total energy , and if @xmath30 this overwhelms the negative contribution of the negative energy vector field . in particular , in the case of anti - kaluza - klein theory ( @xmath31 )",
    ", the black holes always have positive mass .",
    "the case @xmath32 is associated with the five dimensional metric of signature @xmath33 : @xmath34 @xmath35 + r^2 ( 1-r_-r)^32 ( d^2 + ^2d^2 ) where the upper sign corresponds to the electric case and the lower to the magnetic case and the vector field @xmath36 must be chosen accordingly . in either case , since for @xmath37 the metric component @xmath38 never vanishes , the regularity properties are the same as for the four dimensional metric .    in fact , for @xmath29 , one can show that @xmath18 is not just positive but it is bounded below by a positive quantity proportional to the charge  : m |q| .",
    "this is reminiscent of the bogomolnyi mass bound in ordinary emd theory , however , the solutions saturating this bound are not extreme in the usual sense .",
    "they have 2 distinct horizons @xmath39 satisfying r_+ = 1-a^21+a^2r_- . the fact that these solutions are not extreme , i.e.  @xmath40 , will have profound implications when we come to study their thermodynamic properties .",
    "it will be seen that they have non - zero hawking temperature and the surface area of the event horizon is non - zero .",
    "hence one might expect that they should lose mass by radiating neutral particles resulting in a decrease in the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "however , no static solutions exist with @xmath42  ! this will be discussed in more detail in section  4 .",
    "the main conclusion is that if one reverses the sign of the coupling of the electromagnetic kinetic term in the action then static zero rest mass black hole solutions which are non - singular outside a regular event horizon are indeed possible for @xmath43 . since they are spherically symmetric the total spatial momentum vanishes as well as the mass and so they have vanishing total 4-momentum . in this respect",
    "they should be distinguished from conventional massless particles which have a non - zero but lightlike total 4-momentum .",
    "they should also not be confused with tachyonic excitations which are associated with a spacelike 4-momentum .",
    "it is also interesting to consider what happens if the kinetic energy of the scalar field is taken to be negative . in this case , the scalar field produces a repulsive force and so extreme solutions may be possible and also multi - centre solutions satisfying a force balance , depending on the strength of the dilaton coupling @xmath5 and the sign of the maxwell kinetic term . if the maxwell kinetic term is given the opposite sign , then zero rest mass black holes again become a possibility .",
    "it has become conventional to use the abbreviation emd for the standard einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory in which both the maxwell field and the scalar are given positive kinetic energies . for our purposes , it is therefore convenient to introduce the obvious abbreviations e@xmath44d , em@xmath45 and e@xmath46 for einstein - anti - maxwell - dilaton , einstein - maxwell - anti - dilaton and einstein - anti - maxwell - anti - dilaton theories respectively .",
    "we will now derive and investigate a class of static spherically symmetric black hole solutions with electric charge in each of these theories .",
    "these black holes will form a 2 parameter family of solutions labelled by their mass @xmath18 and electric charge @xmath19 , with the scalar dilaton charge @xmath20 being determined by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we will also find a new wormhole solution which lies outside the class of black hole solutions .      here",
    "the maxwell field is given the usual sign in the action but the scalar is given negative kinetic energy  : ( r + 2()^2 - e^-2af_f^ ) .",
    "static spherically symmetric black holes solutions may be obtained by making use of internal symmetries of the dimensionally reduced 3-dimensional action .",
    "writing the metric in the form ds^2 = -e^2udt^2 + e^-2uh_ijdx^idx^j , where @xmath48 run from 1 to 3 , and taking the maxwell field strength 2-form to be the exterior derivative of the 1-form vector potential @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the electric potential , the system may be described by the 3-dimensional non - linear @xmath4-model action d^3x \\{r(h ) - 2(u)^2 + 2()^2 + 2e^-2u-2a()^2}. [ 3dact ] charged solutions may thus be generated from neutral ones using the symmetries of this action .",
    "the continuous symmetries of the action are given infinitesimally by the following 4 killing vectors acting on the internal target space  : @xmath51 k^(4 ) = 2 + - 2a .",
    "@xmath52 is the generator of the required anti - dilaton - harrison transformation which produces electrically charged solutions from neutral ones .",
    "alternatively , a class of static black holes may be obtained from the usual dilaton black holes by making the substitutions @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the new scalar field @xmath4 and @xmath5 are required to be real and so in the original solution they must be made pure imaginary by analytic continuation . the new metric is thus obtained simply by the replacement @xmath55  : @xmath56 + r^2 ( 1-r_-r)^2a^2a^2 - 1(d^2 + ^2d ^2 ) .",
    "the scalar field becomes e^= ( 1-r_-r)^aa^2 - 1 and the maxwell field is f = qr^2dtdr , where q = .",
    "thus for @xmath43 we must have @xmath57 and for @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "clearly then extreme solutions are only possible if @xmath43 , and they satisfy m^2 = q^21-a^2 .",
    "the scalar charge is given by = ar_-1-a^2 and the adm mass is m = 12(r_++1+a^21-a^2r_- ) .",
    "thus we have m^2 - ^2 - q^2 = ( r_+-r_-)^2 and so these black holes can not have zero mass .",
    "the solutions for @xmath60 require more careful consideration . as we take the limit @xmath61 , it is clear that various metric components will blow up , unless @xmath62 .",
    "however , we may obtain finite results by setting @xmath63 and keeping @xmath20 constant as we take the limit  : @xmath64 + r^2e^2||/r(d^2+^2d^2 ) .",
    "the scalar field becomes = r , where the sign of @xmath20 is the same as the sign of @xmath65 and the maxwell field is f = r^2dtdr .",
    "the adm mass is now",
    "m = || + r_+ which is always positive .    for @xmath58",
    "the causal structure is the same as for the schwarzschild solution , with a spacelike singularity at @xmath25 hidden behind a regular event horizon at @xmath21 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath28 is unreachable , since @xmath66 in this case . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the singularity at @xmath68 is null ( except in the einstein - maxwell case , @xmath6 , when it becomes the inner cauchy horizon ) .",
    "if we allow both the scalar and the maxwell fields to have negative kinetic terms , then we expect once more to find regular zero rest mass black holes . the action is ( r + 2()^2 + e^-2af_f^ ) and the solutions may be obtained from those above by taking @xmath19 to be pure imaginary .",
    "the metric is the same but now q = , so if @xmath43 , @xmath66 and if @xmath58 , @xmath70 .",
    "extreme solutions satisfy m^2 = q^2a^2 - 1 and so are only possible for @xmath58 .",
    "zero mass black holes are now possible once more , if we set r_+ = 1+a^2a^2 - 1r_- for @xmath71 .",
    "the case @xmath60 must be checked separately . setting @xmath72 and taking the limit @xmath61 we obtain the metric @xmath73 + r^2e^-2||/r(d^2+^2d^2 ) , with f = r^2dtdr and = r , where the sign of @xmath20 is now opposite to that of @xmath5 . the adm mass is therefore m = r_+ - || which may become zero or negative .",
    "thus we see that zero rest mass black holes , non - singular outside a regular event horizon , violating the positive energy theorem , exist in e@xmath44d theory for @xmath43 and in e@xmath46 theory for all @xmath5 , but not in em@xmath45 theory .",
    "that is not to say that the positive energy theorem holds in em@xmath74 theory .",
    "since the scalar field has negative kinetic energy , it violates the dominant energy condition ( in fact it violates the weak energy condition ) and so we expect counter - examples to the positive energy theorem .",
    "one such counter - example with @xmath75 may be obtained from the schwarzschild solution by using the discrete duality between the metric function @xmath76 and the dilaton @xmath4 in the action ( [ 3dact ] ) with @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting solution describes a _ transparent massless _",
    "wormhole  : @xmath78 = ^-1(rc ) .",
    "[ worm ] since @xmath75 , this is a solution of _ both _ em@xmath74 and e@xmath46 theory , violating the positive energy theorem .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in section  5 .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether such solutions are stable .",
    "presumably they are not . in the case of zero mass black holes ,",
    "some insight into this question may be gained by studying their thermodynamic properties and also by considering accelerating solutions .",
    "in order to see how these black holes move we turn to the dilaton - c - metrics @xcite . in e@xmath44d theory these have the form ds^2 = 1a^2(x - y)^2 \\ { f(x ) + f(y ) } . in the _ magnetic _ case the scalar field is e^2a = f(x)f(y ) where f(u ) ( 1+r_-au)^2a^21+a^2 and g(u ) ( 1+r_-au)^1-a^21+a^2 .",
    "the vector field is given by a = xd .",
    "the electrically charged solutions may be obtained by a generalized duality transformation .",
    "this transformation leaves the metric unchanged . as before we are interested in the case when @xmath22 is positive but @xmath23 negative .",
    "we take the acceleration parameter @xmath79 to be positive .",
    "the behaviour of the solutions depends upon the cubic ( u ) 1-u^2(1+r_+a u ) . because @xmath23 is negative the ordering of the roots is different from the standard one and so our labelling is different . for @xmath80",
    "the cubic @xmath81 has three real roots , which we label in increasing order  : -1ar_+ < u_1 < -3 < u_2 < -1 < u_3 < 1 . thus roots @xmath82 and @xmath83 are negative and @xmath84 is positive . in addition , if @xmath85 then @xmath86 has another zero corresponding to the root of the function ( u ) = 1+r_-au i.e.  @xmath87 .    if we interpret @xmath88 as an angular coordinate then the requirement that @xmath89 and that it have finite range dictates it must vary between the least negative and the least positive root of @xmath86 , i.e @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "the end points of this interval will be regular axes of symmetry free of conical singularities if and only if the ` no strut ' condition g^(u_2)+g^(u_3)=0 [ nostrut ] holds .",
    "we are assuming of course that @xmath91 are chosen so that u_3<u_4 = -1r_-a . because @xmath92 it suffices that @xmath93 for this to be true .",
    "if the coordinate @xmath94 is to be timelike then the radial variable @xmath95 must range between the two negative or the two positive roots of @xmath86 . in the limit @xmath96",
    ", the coordinate transformation @xmath97 gives the e@xmath44d black hole solutions in the usual coordinates .",
    "thus @xmath98 corresponds to the black hole event horizon and , for @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the acceleration horizon .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath101 $ ]",
    ". the resulting solution will be asymptotically flat . because it is boost - invariant the total adm 4-momentum vanishes .",
    "the solution may be thought of as a pair of uniformly accelerating black holes with ` mass parameter ' @xmath18 and anti - charge @xmath19 .",
    "however it is better to think of @xmath18 as a measure of the size of the horizon . as in the case of the static black holes considered in the last section",
    ", the cauchy horizon / singularity at @xmath23 can not be reached because @xmath102 and there is a singularity at @xmath25 .",
    "the causal structure is thus equivalent to that of the usual vacuum c - metric @xcite .",
    "it is well known that if the vector field has the usual sign in the lagrangian then it is impossible to satisfy the regularity condition ( [ nostrut ] ) for any value of the electric charge , including zero , and thereby eliminate the conical singularities .",
    "indeed if this were possible then the solutions would violate the positive mass theorem for black holes .",
    "moreover one might then expect to be able to pick the acceleration parameter of the solution so as to render the surface gravities of the acceleration horizon and the event horizon equal .",
    "if this were possible it would be possible to analytically continue the time parameter to give a regular euclidean instanton solution ( periodic in imaginary time ) which would mediate the instability of minkowski spacetime .",
    "however , as we shall see , the situation is rather different if the vector field enters the lagrangian with the opposite sign .",
    "this is not surprising because we have seen in the previous section that static non - singular configurations with vanishing total 4-momentum exist in such theories .    the simplest case to consider is the einstein - anti - maxwell one , @xmath6 .",
    "then the function @xmath86 becomes ( after a suitable linear coordinate transformation of @xmath88 and @xmath95 , see @xcite ) the quartic : g(u)= 1 -u^2 -2ma u^3 + q^2 a^2 u^4 .",
    "clearly if we set @xmath103 this quartic polynomial will be symmetrical about the origin and the no strut condition is automatically satisfied by symmetry .",
    "thus we have a regular lorentzian solution representing two uniformly accelerating black holes with equal and opposite charges in an asymptotically flat spacetime with vanishing total adm mass .",
    "note that ultimately the black holes will approach the velocity of light .    because the solution without an applied electric field has no conical singularity , adding an electric field should produce a solution with a conical singularity .",
    "if this is correct it indicates that trying to accelerate a zero rest mass black hole with an electric field can not give rise to a constant acceleration .",
    "what about the instanton ?",
    "we need to check to see whether we can choose @xmath104 so that the surface gravities of the event horizon and the acceleration horizon can be equal .",
    "this requires that the slopes at the two roots @xmath105 and @xmath106 be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign .",
    "this can only happen in the limiting case that they coincide @xmath107 .",
    "this requires that the charge and acceleration be related by |q|= 1 2 a. thus we see that although accelerating solutions without conical singularities exist in this case , there are no instanton solutions which would mediate the decay of the vacuum .",
    "we will discuss vacuum decay in more detail in section  7 .",
    "the situation with a scalar field present is only slightly more complicated .",
    "remaining with e@xmath44d theory , so the scalar has positive kinetic energy , we recall that zero rest mass black holes were possible only if @xmath43 .",
    "thus we expect to be able to satisfy the no strut condition only if @xmath43 and obtain a regular solution representing a pair of zero rest mass e@xmath44d black holes accelerating away from one another .",
    "writing the function @xmath86 as a product of its factors , we have g(u ) = c(u - u_1)(u - u_2)(u - u_3)(u - u_4)^p where p = 1-a^21+a^2 and @xmath108 are ordered  : u_1 < u_2 < u_3 < u_4 .",
    "the no strut condition then becomes ( u_2-u_1)(u_4-u_2)^p = ( u_3-u_1)(u_4-u_3)^p .",
    "we may solve this to express @xmath109 , say , in terms of the other roots  : u_4 = u_3(u_3-u_1)^1p - u_2(u_2-u_1)^1p(u_3-u_1)^1p-(u_2-u_1)^1p . finally , for consistency , we need to check that @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath111 ( i.e.  @xmath43 ) , then the denominator of the expression for @xmath109 is positive and we can multiply up .",
    "the inequality @xmath110 then simplifies to ( u_3-u_2)(u_2-u_1)^1p > 0 , which holds automatically . thus the no strut condition can be made to hold if @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath58 ( i.e.  @xmath112 ) , the denominator in the expression for @xmath109 is negative , all inequalities must be reversed on multiplying up and the condition @xmath110 can not be satisfied .",
    "in the special case @xmath60 , @xmath113 and the no strut condition reduces to @xmath114 .",
    "thus , as predicted , the conical singularity in the e@xmath115d c - metric may only be removed if @xmath43 , giving a regular solution representing a pair of zero rest mass black holes with equal and opposite charges accelerating away from one another .      the em@xmath45 c - metric may be obtained from the usual dilaton c - metric by the replacement @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the form of the metric remains unchanged but the functions @xmath116 and @xmath117 become f(u ) & = & ( 1+r_-au)^2a^2a^2 - 1 , + g(u ) & = & ( 1+r_-au)^1+a^21-a^2 .",
    "the scalar field is again given by e^2a = f(x)f(y ) and the vector potential 1-form is a = xd . for @xmath43 , @xmath118 and so the new ordering of the roots of @xmath86 becomes u_4 = -1ar_-",
    "< u_1 < u_2 < u_3 . as before we restrict @xmath88 to lie between @xmath83 and @xmath84 so that the metric component @xmath119 is positive and @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "the no strut condition @xmath120 is equivalent to ( u_2-u_1)(u_2-u_4)^p = ( u_3-u_1)(u_3-u_4)^p where p = 1+a^21-a^2 > 0 . thus solving for @xmath109 , we obtain u_4 = u_3(u_3-u_1)^1p - u_2(u_2-u_1)^1p(u_3-u_1)^1p-(u_2-u_1)^1p . for consistency , we require that @xmath121 which , after multiplying up , is equivalent to ( u_3-u_1)^1 + 1p < ( u_2-u_1)^1 + 1p .",
    "but , since @xmath122 , this inequality does not hold .",
    "therefore , with the required ordering of the roots , the no strut condition can not hold .",
    "a special case of this result is @xmath6 , ordinary einstein - maxwell theory , for which it is well known that one can not remove the conical singularities of the c - metric .    for @xmath58 , @xmath123 ,",
    "the ordering of the roots reverts to u_1 < u_2 < u_3 < u_4=-1ar_- and a similar argument can be used to show that the no strut condition can not hold .",
    "in fact the argument is identical to the argument used in e@xmath44d theory for @xmath58 above .",

    "for @xmath58 this divergence is excluded by the requirement that @xmath164 .",
    "the origin of this divergence can be seen by considering behaviour of the temperature as @xmath18 varies .",
    "initially , for large @xmath18 , the temperature increases as @xmath18 decreases .",
    "however , for @xmath43 , the temperature ultimately approaches zero as one approaches extremality and so there must be a turning point in the temperature as a function of @xmath18 at constant @xmath19 .",
    "this then is the divergence of the specific heat @xmath165 . in the case",
    "@xmath58 , however , the temperature diverges as one approaches extremality and so there is no such turning point .",
    "the case @xmath60 is somewhat special . in this case",
    "the specific heat reduces to c_q = -2r_+^2 = -8m^2 @xmath19 .",
    "the temperature is @xmath166 , also independent of @xmath19 .",
    "this is the case which arises in string theory and we have the interesting result that the thermodynamic properties at constant charge are _ identical _ to those of the the schwarzschild solution in general relativity .",
    "this may be seen as a result of the fact that for @xmath60 the metric is the same as the schwarzschild solution except for the angular components of the metric which do not affect its thermodynamic properties .",
    "we may thus deduce immediately that the black hole will radiate away its mass faster and faster , reaching extremality in a _ finite _ time .    to estimate the time taken for the more general emd black holes to radiate sufficient mass to become extreme , we use stefan s law to approximate the rate of loss of mass of the black hole  : -t^4 which gives ( 1-r_-r_+)^4 - 2a^21+a^2 with @xmath19 held constant .",
    "for nearly extreme solutions , we may set @xmath167 giving ^4 - 2a^21+a^2 . thus the time",
    "taken to reach extremality will be infinite for @xmath43 and finite for @xmath29 . since the area of the event horizon vanishes for extreme emd black holes , this semi - classical description of the black hole thermodynamics",
    "is expected to break down near extremality and a more complete quantum theory is needed to make further predictions about what happens near the end of the evaporation .    in e@xmath44d theory @xmath123 and there are no extreme solutions .",
    "so what is the endpoint of the evaporation ? the specific heat at constant charge is again given by ( [ spheat ] ) but now @xmath66 and the electric charge is given by @xmath168 .",
    "for @xmath71 the behaviour of @xmath162 as a function of @xmath169 is shown in fig .",
    "again the behaviour is qualitatively different depending on whether @xmath26 is greater than or less than 1 .",
    "for @xmath43 there is no lower bound on the mass and the specific heat approaches zero as @xmath170 .",
    "this can be seen as a result of the fact that the temperature @xmath171 increases without bound as @xmath170 with @xmath19 held constant ( see fig .",
    "a natural question to ask is then    how quickly will the black hole radiate away mass and how long will it take for @xmath18 to reach @xmath157 .",
    "as @xmath172 , the outer horizon shrinks as @xmath173 and the inner horizon approaches @xmath157 like @xmath18 .",
    "thus the temperature @xmath171 diverges like t ~|m|^3-a^21+a^2 and the area of the event horizon decreases to zero like ~|m|^-41+a^2 .",
    "thus , if we approximate the rate of loss of mass by stefan s law , we have ~-|m|^8 - 4a^21+a^2 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath43 , this rather crude approximation for the evaporation rate tells us that the black hole s mass will reach @xmath157 within a _ finite _ time . of course , as @xmath174 , the event horizon shrinks to zero size and so this semi - classical description will break down . nonetheless this simple calculation is yet another indicator of the instability of these black holes .",
    "for @xmath58 the situation is rather different . in this case",
    "the mass is bounded below  :  @xmath158 and no static spherically symmetric solutions exist with masses smaller than this .",
    "also , as was pointed out in section  2 , solutions saturating this bound are _ not _ extreme .",
    "they have @xmath40 and @xmath175 .",
    "4 shows that as @xmath176 the temperature @xmath171 becomes finite and non - zero .",
    "also the specific heat @xmath165 vanishes in this limit .",
    "how long does a black hole take to radiate away sufficient mass to saturate this bound ?",
    "what happens to black holes which do saturate this mass bound ?",
    "since the temperature @xmath171 and event horizon area @xmath155 both remain finite and non - zero in this limit , stefan s law predicts that e@xmath44d black holes with @xmath58 should evaporate and reach @xmath177 within a _",
    "finite _ time .",
    "once the black hole reaches this limit it can no longer lose mass at constant charge and remain static and spherically symmetric since no such solutions exist with @xmath178 .",
    "of course , when _ any _ black hole loses mass by the emission of a particle , the spacetime during the process is neither static nor spherically symmetric .",
    "however , in the case of a stable black hole such as the schwarzschild solution , the spacetime may settle down to a new schwarzschild solution with reduced mass after the emission of the particle . in the present case",
    ", however , there is no such static spherically symmetric solution for the spacetime to settle down to .",
    "we may thus expect some sort of catastrophic quantum mechanical instability to be exhibited by these black holes .",
    "the case @xmath60 is again somewhat special . the temperature and specific heat are given by t = 18 m c_q = -8m^2 , .",
    "note that once again these thermodynamic quantities are identical to those of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "also , as for the schwarzschild solution , the mass is positive , @xmath179 .",
    "however , unlike the schwarzschild solution , these black holes have electric charge and so we can not set @xmath103 unless @xmath180 . if it were the case that these black holes with @xmath60 only emitted neutral particles then , as for the schwarzschild black hole in the semi - classical approximation , they would radiate away all of their mass within a finite time .",
    "this is not possible , however , since no solution exists with @xmath103 and @xmath181 .",
    "this problem is easily resolved because as @xmath18 decreases with @xmath19 held fixed , the ratio @xmath182 increases without bound , as does the electric potential @xmath183 on the horizon .",
    "eventually this will become large enough to give a significant probability for the emission of charged particles by the black hole .",
    "thus the black hole may radiate away all of its charge as well as all of its mass .      to calculate the euclidean action for extreme dilaton black holes ( @xmath184 ) we need to take into account the fact that the topology of these solutions is different from that of non - extreme solutions and",
    "so there is potentially an extra contribution to the action from the inner boundary .",
    "the euclidean metric is @xmath185 + r^2(1-r_hr)^2a^21+a^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) .",
    "there are 2 distinct cases to be considered  : @xmath6 and @xmath186 . if @xmath6 we have the extreme electric euclidean  solution .",
    "the horizon @xmath187 is infinitely far away along any curve in this space and so the topology is the the well - known pipette shape , see fig .  5 .",
    "since the point @xmath187 is no longer a point in the space , we must add to the action a contribution from the extrinsic curvature integrated over an inner boundary just outside @xmath187 . if @xmath186 the point @xmath187 is a curvature singularity .",
    "we may deal with this by cutting it out of the space by introducing a boundary just outside @xmath187 . in either case",
    "there is potentially a contribution to the euclidean action due to the integral of the extrinsic curvature over this boundary .",
    "however , it is easy to check that this boundary term vanishes as the inner boundary is taken to @xmath188 .    in the non - extreme case",
    "we were forced to identify @xmath136 with a particular period @xmath137 in order to remove a conical singularity on the horizon . in the extreme case ,",
    "the horizon is no longer a part of the space and so we are free to identify @xmath136 with any period @xmath137 we choose , or not at all .",
    "clearly then the euclidean action vanishes in the extreme limit @xmath189 since the contributions from the boundary term at infinity @xmath190 and from the volume integral of @xmath141 cancel .",
    "note that this would not be the case if we considered magnetically charged black holes since in that case @xmath116 would be real and the volume integral would give a _ positive _ contribution of @xmath190 to the action .",

    "it has been pointed out by polyakov @xcite that this theory admits ( singular ) instantons which correspond to dirac monopoles .",

    "the existence of negative energy , asymptotically minkowskian black hole solutions in einstein - anti - maxwell theory is a strong indication that the vacuum of the theory is unstable .",
    "further evidence for this instability was provided in the sections describing accelerating black holes and their thermodynamics . a more convincing demonstration of the instability of the vacuum would be provided by an instanton solution describing its decay .",
    "we therefore look for a euclidean solution which approaches the vacuum at infinity , i.e.  it must be asymptotically @xmath151 .    as we saw in the last section , the euclidean schwarzschild solution will not do because , to avoid a singularity at the horizon @xmath21 , it was necessary to periodically identify the former time coordinate @xmath159 .",
    "the solution is thus asymptotically @xmath224 .",
    "note that the period of this identification of the imaginary time coordinate , @xmath227 , is precisely @xmath228 where @xmath171 is the hawking temperature of the lorentzian black hole solution .",
    "this suggests that we should consider the extreme  solution since this has @xmath229 and so we would be free to identify @xmath159 with whatever period we liked ( or not at all ) .",
    "there is a slight complication in that , in order to obtain the euclidean  solution , we need to take @xmath19 to be pure imaginary .",
    "however , since this is precisely what we had to do to obtain the anti-  solution , we will obtain the desired solution of the euclidean einstein - anti - maxwell equations with @xmath19 real . to see this in more detail , consider the @xmath230 lorentzian anti - solution  : @xmath231 a = qrdt . here",
    "@xmath230 is real and the horizons satisfy @xmath232 , so this is _ not _ an extreme solution ( in fact as we saw in section 2 , there are no extreme solutions in this theory ) .",
    "now we obtain the euclidean solution by setting @xmath233 and , in order to keep the vector potential 1-form @xmath79 real , we must also make the replacement @xmath234 .",
    "we thus obtain the following euclidean solution of the einstein - anti - maxwell equations @xmath235 a = mrdz , [ instant ] which is our desired instanton . in isotropic",
    "coordinates , @xmath236 , it may be written as ds^2 = ( 1+m)^-2dz^2 + ( 1+m)^2where @xmath237 .",
    "note that this space , restricted to @xmath238 , is everywhere non - singular and geodesically complete .",
    "the singularity at @xmath239 is at an infinite proper distance along any geodesic .",
    "there is no need to periodically identify @xmath209 , or alternatively , we are free to identify @xmath209 with any period we choose .    to see how the above instanton leads to the instability of the vacuum , we analytically continue to the lorentzian solution by setting @xmath240  : @xmath241,\\ ] ] a = m+mdz where @xmath242 .",
    "this then is the solution into which the vacuum decays .",
    "it is a tachyon solution , as in the last section , describing a charged particle moving with infinite speed along the @xmath209-axis .",
    "however , here we wish to interpret it differently as representing the instability of the vacuum in einstein - anti - maxwell theory .",
    "it is still everywhere non - singular and geodesically complete since the proper distance down the `` infinite throat '' at @xmath239 is infinite along all geodesics .",
    "however , it is clear that this throat region expands outwards radially in all directions perpendicular to the @xmath209-axis at the speed of light .    due to the cylindrical symmetry of the solution ,",
    "it is best described in cylindrical polar coordinates , @xmath243  : ds^2 = ( 1+m)^-2dz^2 + ( 1+m)^2 .",
    "thus , at t=0 , an infinite throat forms along the @xmath209 axis .",
    "the @xmath209-axis becomes infinitely far away along geodesics in the new spacetime and this throat region expands away from the @xmath209-axis at the speed of light .",
    "actually it is this rapid expansion which is responsible for the @xmath209-axis being infinitely far away .",
    "if one considers a constant time slice , then it is easy to see that @xmath25 is not at an infinite proper distance from points with @xmath37 .",
    "however , such curves in the constant time slice are not geodesics . after the formation of the throat ,",
    "the topology of the spacetime changes to @xmath244 .",
    "the above solution describes one such throat region forming and expanding to infinity at the speed of light .",
    "it is more realistic , physically , to suppose that actually such throats will form throughout the vacuum at a given rate per unit volume and then expand outwards until they collide with one another .",
    "of course , an observer in the spacetime will never see a throat form because , since it travels outwards at the speed of light , by the time he sees it , he will have already fallen down it ! to investigate the properties of the spacetime `` down the throat '' , i.e.  near @xmath245 , define new coordinates @xmath246 by r & = & e^ut + t & = & e^ut then the metric becomes ds^2 dz^2 + m^2du^2 - m^2dt^2 + m^2 ^ 2td^2 .",
    "this is a completely non - singular , cylindrically symmetric spacetime ( @xmath247 ) such that the radius of the @xmath225 increases rapidly as the time coordinate @xmath171 increases .",
    "finally , in order to show that the above mechanism for the decay of the einstein - anti - maxwell vacuum is important , we need to calculate the probability of the production of such infinite throats . according to the semi - classical approximation , this probability is @xmath248 where @xmath128 is the action of the euclidean instanton ( [ instant ] ) .",
    "but ( [ instant ] ) is equivalent to the extreme euclidean  solution of the euclidean einstein - maxwell equations and so , as we saw in section  4.3 , its action is zero .",
    "therefore one expects these infinite throats to be copiously produced and hence , as expected , the einstein - anti - maxwell vacuum will be genuinely unstable .",
    "a similar construction gives the decay process for the e@xmath115d vacuum .",
    "we start from the e@xmath44d black hole solutions of section  2  : @xmath249 + r^2(1-r_-r)^2a^21+a^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic vector potential 1-form is a = .",
    "note that @xmath123 and so @xmath79 is real .",
    "we euclideanize by setting @xmath233 and change the sign of @xmath23 to keep the 1-form @xmath79 real . since @xmath23 is now positive",
    ", we may obtain the extreme solution by setting @xmath250 giving @xmath251 + r^2(1-r_+r)^2a^21+a^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) , @xmath252 note that this is a euclidean solution of the e@xmath44d equations .",
    "it has a curvature singularity at @xmath21 and so this point must be excluded from the space .",
    "this means that there is no need to compactify any of the coordinates and so the topology may be taken as @xmath253 .",
    "it is again convenient to introduce isotropic coordinates , @xmath254 giving ds^2 = ( 1+r_+)^-21+a^2dz^2 + ( 1+r_+)^21+a^2(dx^2+dy^2+d^2 ) , [ instant2 ] where @xmath237 .",
    "this then is the instanton describing the decay process of the e@xmath44d vacuum .",
    "the lorentzian solution into which the vacuum decays is obtained by setting @xmath240 .",
    "the curvature singularity at @xmath239 now gives a singular lightcone @xmath255 expanding radially outwards at the speed of light from the @xmath209-axis .",
    "this may be viewed as the time evolution of the initial data given by the 3-metric ( setting @xmath256 in ( [ instant2 ] ) ) ds^2 = ( 1+r_+)^-21+a^2dz^2 + ( 1+r_+)^21+a^2(dx^2+dy^2 ) which is completely non - singular .",
    "the resulting spacetime , however , is singular on the lightcone @xmath255  : @xmath257 + ( 1+r_+)^21+a^2(dx^2+dy^2-dt^2 ) .",
    "thus a naked singularity spontaneously forms along the @xmath209-axis at @xmath211 which then expands radially outwards at the speed of light .",
    "we saw in section  4.3 that the action for the euclidean instanton ( [ instant2 ] ) is zero and so one expects copious production of such line singularities and thus that the e@xmath44d vacuum will be extremely unstable .",
    "note that this argument remains true equally well for _ all _ values of the dilaton coupling @xmath5 .",
    "we have derived families of black holes in theories of gravity coupled to a maxwell field and a scalar dilaton , in which the kinetic energies for either or both of the fields are allowed to be negative . in the case where just the maxwell field is given negative kinetic energy , we found that regular black hole solutions with zero or negative mass were possible provided that the dilaton coupling @xmath5 was less than 1 .",
    "if the dilaton is also given negative kinetic energy , then such black holes are possible for _ all _ values of @xmath5 . in this case",
    "we also found a neutral massless wormhole solution characterized by a non - zero scalar charge .",
    "this wormhole was described as ` transparent ' because it has no horizons and timelike or null geodesics can pass through it freely ( it was shown not to exert any gravitational attraction ) and so it would be possible to see through it from one universe into another isometric universe .",
    "the analogue of the c - metric in these theories was derived , describing a pair black holes accelerating away from one another . an investigation into whether or not it is possible to satisfy the ` no strut ' condition and",
    "thus remove the conical singularities of the c - metric showed that it was possible to do so in exactly those cases where the theory admitted zero rest mass black holes .",
    "we thus found regular solutions describing pairs of zero rest mass black holes accelerating away from one another .",
    "we failed , however , to find , from these solutions , an instanton which would describe the decay of the vacuum .",
    "however , by looking at tachyonic solutions , we were able to give a alternative way in which the vacuum would decay .",
    "the action for the instanton describing this instability was found to be zero so that this decay mode is not suppressed at all .",
    "dyson s original argument against the convergence of the perturbation series in qed relied on the production of pairs of oppositely charged particles which ( if the electromagnetic coupling constant were taken to be pure imaginary ) would repel one another thus destabilizing the vacuum . in this paper , we tried to repeat the argument with pairs of charged black holes in a theory of gravity coupled to a maxwell field with negative kinetic energy .",
    "we were , however , unable to find an instanton describing the production of such pairs of black holes .",
    "however , by using other semi - classical arguments , we were able to show that in such a theory the vacuum is still unstable .",
    "thus we may still argue that a perturbative theory describing gravity and electromagnetism can not be uniformly convergent as a perturbative expansion in the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the results were also extended to include a scalar dilaton field and the vacuum in this case was also found to be unstable .",
    "this result holds for _ all _ values of the dilaton coupling @xmath5 , in particular for @xmath258 which is the case which arises from kaluza - klein theory in which the extra dimension is taken to be timelike rather than spacelike .",
    "this may have some relevance to recent ideas in string theory , f - theory and other theories which consider the possibility of extra timelike dimensions @xcite .",
    "the results imply that such theories appear to be very unstable and , as we have seen , their solutions may be rather pathological , as we might have expected ."
