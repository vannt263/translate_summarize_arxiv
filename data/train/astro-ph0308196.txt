    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we concentrate on lyman  @xmath0  emission powered by star formation .",
    "hot stars emit photons capable of ionizing hydrogen .",
    "if the ionized gas density is sufficient , hydrogen will recombine on relevant timescales .",
    "the recombination cascade produces a rich spectrum of lines , but usually includes a lyman  @xmath0  photon ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "because most recombinations produce lyman  @xmath0  photons , it is predicted to be the strongest line emitted from recombination emission .",
    "agn activity can also provide ionizing photons that ultimately generate a strong lyman  @xmath0  line .",
    "additional sources of lyman  @xmath0photons are atomic - hydrogen cooling of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and fluorescence of gas clouds illuminated by a strong , non - local source of ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted strength of the lyman  @xmath0  line , and the assumed prevalence of star formation at early times ( inferred from the abundance of old stars in the local universe ) led to an early prediction of an abundant population of high - redshift galaxies with very strong lyman  @xmath0  emission lines @xcite .",
    "though subsequent revisions to the theory of galaxy formation , primarily that it was a hierarchical process , explained the relative lack of lyman  @xmath0  detections compared to those early predictions @xcite , searching for galaxies based solely on strong lyman  @xmath0  emission has been validated recently as an effective technique for identifying galaxies up to @xmath2 .",
    "lyman  @xmath0  is a resonant transition with a large cross - section . as a consequence ,",
    "small quantities of neutral hydrogen scatter away lyman  @xmath0photons in direction and frequency .",
    "in particular , if the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is not highly ionized , as is expected for at least some of the time between recombination ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 @xcite , then the neutral hydrogen in the igm can easily scatter the lyman  @xmath0  line from galaxies .",
    "the lyman  @xmath0  photons are not destroyed , but the scattering process diffuses the line in areal coverage and frequency @xcite , and the resulting low surface brightness emission is currently unobservable .",
    "a simple consideration of the igm shows that the blue side of the emergent lyman  @xmath0  line would be scattered away by a neutral igm , and only the red side of the line would be observed .",
    "this follows from considering that most of the scattering by neutral hydrogen comes at wavelengths near the lyman  @xmath0  transition in the rest - frame of the gas .",
    "however , for a completely neutral igm at high redshifts , the lyman  @xmath0cross - section far from resonance becomes important , since the natural line profile has ` damping wings ' that fall off only like @xmath8 .",
    "thus even if the igm has no component at the velocity of corresponding to resonant scattering of a particular lyman  @xmath0  photon , that photon may still be scattered .",
    "this observation led to the conclusion that observations of lyman  @xmath0  emission lines ( or their absence ) at high redshifts may probe the ionization state of the igm in a regime poorly tested by the gunn - peterson trough measurements , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in particular , since the _ wmap _ satellite discovered a high optical depth to the last scattering surface @xcite , the ionization history of the universe at @xmath1 is of great interest . though the _ wmap _ results indicate that the universe was mostly ionized for a substantial history of the universe at @xmath1 , it does not constrain the exact ionization level or the history in detail .",
    "there are now many predictions for the ionization history at @xmath1 based on semi - analytic and numerical modelling of early star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if there is a population of strong lyman  @xmath0  emitters at the redshifts in question , @xmath10 , and if the effect of igm scattering on their observed properties can be calculated , then future surveys for lyman  @xmath0  emission may provide valuable information on the reionization history at @xmath1 .    here",
    "we use a more sophisticated treatment of the dynamics of the igm around galaxies with strong intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  emission to investigate the effect of the igm on the observed line .",
    "the igm model we use will be presented in more detail separately , but is summarized here and nearly identical to that described in @xcite .",
    "the key feature is that infall of the igm toward the galaxies is included .",
    "@xcite have showed that such an igm model makes a prediction for an absorption feature in the spectra of high - redshift qso lyman  @xmath0lines .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : lyascat ] we present the lyman  @xmath0  scattering cross - section .",
    "section  [ sec : lyaprof ] describes the model for the intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  line profile and the observed profile modified by igm scattering .",
    "section  [ sec : lyares ] presents lyman  @xmath0  line profiles as a function of the ( many ) input parameters that influence the observed line profile .",
    "we introduce the possible role of galactic winds in section  [ sec : galwind ] .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses our lyman  @xmath0  flux predictions with comparison to current observations , and also reviews model assumptions .",
    "section  [ sec : summ ] summarizes .",
    "a lyman  @xmath0  photon is emitted when a hydrogen atom makes a transition from the @xmath15 level to the @xmath16 ground - state .",
    "the emitted photon has an energy of @xmath17 and a wavelength of @xmath18 .",
    "the transition is the strongest spontaneous transition of a hydrogen atom , with an einstein @xmath19 value of @xmath20 .",
    "correspondingly , the absorption cross - section of the transition is relatively large as well .",
    "a lyman  @xmath0  photon travelling through a region of neutral hydrogen will be repeatedly absorbed and re - emitted .",
    "this process by itself does not destroy lyman  @xmath0  photons , but if photons are scattered over a sufficiently large region such that an observation spatially resolves the emission , then the lyman  @xmath0  line will be difficult to observe in practice @xcite . in this work",
    "we assume that lyman  @xmath0  photons scattered in the igm , that is , outside of the virial radius of the emitting galaxy , are missed by observation . for a @xmath21 galaxy , the virial radius is larger than 1  ( the size of a typical spectroscopic slit ) for any galaxy more massive than @xmath22 .",
    "so under the assumption that photons emitted in the lyman  @xmath0  emission line of a galaxy are lost from subsequent observation if they are scattered by the igm , we constructed a model of the igm ( see section  [ sec : igmmodel ] ) and computed the absorption due to neutral hydrogen .",
    "the natural absorption cross - section @xmath23 is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the total absorption cross - section due to a parcel of igm gas is determined by the kinetic properties of the gas , both bulk and thermal , as well as the natural cross - section .",
    "bulk motions just introduce a frequency shift , but thermal motions broaden the profile , modelled as the convolution of the natural cross - section with a maxwellian velocity distribution , @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the hydrogen atom and @xmath30 is the temperature of the igm gas ( modelled in the next section ) .",
    "for the usual lorentzian approximation of @xmath23 , the convolved cross - section would be a voigt profile , hence we label our convolved cross - section @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : lgdpxv ] shows @xmath32 , assuming a temperature of @xmath33 for the scattering gas . the profile has a doppler core with a half - width of @xmath34 and power - law tails called ` damping wings . '",
    "if the igm at the redshift of interest is or has previously been reionized , then @xmath33 is probably a good approximation .",
    "if the igm is still thermally pristine , then the temperature may be as low as @xmath35 , resulting in a narrower doppler core of the scattering profile . in practice",
    "this would have a small effect on any near - future observation .",

    "the top axis shows the velocity ( in the frame of the absorbing atom ) where the lyman  @xmath0  resonance corresponds to the wavelength on the bottom axis.,width=317 ]",
    "we will refer to two types of lyman  @xmath0  lines from galaxies .",
    "the * intrinsic line * is the line produced in the galaxy , specifically , the line that reaches the virial radius of the halo containing the emitting galaxy .",
    "the * observed line * is the line after propagation though the igm to @xmath36 .",
    "a lyman  @xmath0  emission line from a high - redshift galaxy is typically a consequence of hydrogen recombinations in nebular gas .",
    "the ionization of the  region may be maintained either by hot stars or by gas accretion onto a black hole . though luminous qsos have been discovered at @xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , deep x - ray data indicates that most galaxies at those redshifts do not contain powerful agns @xcite .",
    "thus in this work we will assume recent ( @xmath37  myr ago ) star formation powers lyman  @xmath0  emission lines .",
    "type o stars emit hydrogen - ionizing photons .",
    "the universe is not old enough to have formed these stars . ]",
    "some fraction , @xmath38 , of these photons may escape the galaxy without absorption .",
    "the rest of the photons are absorbed by either neutral hydrogen or dust within the galaxy .",
    "an ionizing photon absorbed by a hydrogen atom initiates a cascade of recombination emission , ultimately resulting in a lyman  @xmath0  photon about 2/3 of the time , and two - photon emission the other 1/3 of the time @xcite .",
    "a lyman  @xmath0  photon subsequently scatters through absorption and reemission until the optical depth of the galaxy at its wavelength is @xmath39 ; the optical depth is determined both by the position and direction of the photon , and also its wavelength .",
    "if dust is present , it may absorb photons at any time in this process .",
    "the radiative transfer problem for lyman  @xmath0  depends sensitively on the geometry of neutral hydrogen and dust within the galaxy @xcite , and also the dynamics of the hydrogen @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  emission line is centered at the systemic redshift of the emitting galaxy , with a doppler profile shape described by a characteristic velocity , @xmath40 , @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the line profile per unit frequency and @xmath43 in section  [ sec : galwind ] we address other possible intrinsic line profiles .",
    "in this simplified model , two parameters characterize an intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  emission line : its luminosity , @xmath44 , and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath44 depends on the rate of production of ionizing photons , @xmath45 , the ionizing photon escape fraction , @xmath38 , and dust absorption .",
    "the production of ionizing photons in turn depends on the star - formation rate and the metallicity and initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars formed .",
    "none of these quantities may be reliably predicted from first principles for a galaxy at high redshift .",
    "therefore , any use of the _ observed _ lyman  @xmath0  line of a high - redshift galaxy to deduce the radiative transfer properties of the igm will be complicated , unless these quantities can be measured independently of the lyman  @xmath0  line .",
    "the estimation of @xmath40 is simpler .",
    "the likely minimum velocity scale for motion in a galaxy is the circular velocity of the parent halo , @xmath46 ; this velocity may describe the gas motion is the star - formation is mediated by a violent process , such as the merging of two equal - mass galaxies .",
    "if star - formation is a more quiescent process in the galaxy , it may occur in a disk whose peak velocity is , roughly , between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , for realistic halo and disk properties @xcite .",
    "thus we assume @xmath48 .",

    "we describe our model for @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in section  [ sec : igmmodel ] .",

    "the model is very similar to one described in @xcite .",
    "here we summarize our model as it applies to this paper .",
    "the evolution of the density and velocity of the igm follow from the small , linear , initial perturbations imprinted on the universe at very high redshift .",
    "we model the igm starting from the statistical description of linear perturbations by applying a simple description of the non - linear evolution of the perturbations .    specifically , we start by considering a lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxy in a halo of total mass @xmath57 at redshift @xmath58 .",
    "we then constrain the initial linear overdensity on the scale of @xmath57 to produce the halo at redshift @xmath58 . starting from that initial linear overdensity constraint ,",
    "we use the excursion set formalism @xcite to compute the mean initial linear overdensities , averaged in spheres centered on the location of the halo , on scales larger than the scale of @xmath57 .",
    "the mean initial linear overdensity decreases monotonically with increasing scale ; this is not externally imposed .",
    "our approach also implies that the halo is not substructure of a larger collapsed halo ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "once we have the initial linear overdensities of spheres enclosing the halo , we evolve those overdensities using the spherical top - hat model @xcite . because the mean initial linear overdensity decreases monotonically with increasing scale , there is no shell crossing , and the evolution of each igm matter shell is independent of the evolution of the other shells .",
    "our dynamical evolution treats all matter equally , and we assume the baryons trace the dark matter in these shells .",
    "this description would be inappropriate if , e.g. , the lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxy blows a strong wind into its surrounding igm ( see * ? ? ? * for evidence of this at @xmath59 ) , and we will return to this in section  [ sec : galwind ] .    a realistic distribution of initial linear overdensities around a halo , in contrast to the mean initial linear overdensities averaged over many halos , would not in general be spherically symmetric or even monotonic with radius within spherically - averaged shells .",
    "in addition to collapsing toward the galaxy , there would be structures collapsed and collapsing within the ` igm . '",
    "the most straightforward way to assess the effect of these complicated dynamics would be with numerical simulation .",
    "here we appeal to analytic results to demonstrate the effect of structure with the collapsing igm will not severely affect our conclusions .",
    "@xcite computed the bivariate probability distributions of two halos forming at different positions .",
    "their results suggest that outside the virial radius of a halo , the typical enhancement in the number density of halos is , at maximum , only a factor of a few , for any mass .",
    "thus we conclude that the fraction of matter collapsed into halos ( above a given mass ) in the igm surrounding our galaxy of interest is at most a few times the universal collapse fraction . at @xmath60",
    "up to half the mass of the igm may be in the form of collapsed halos with virial temperatures above @xmath61 , that is , halos massive enough to collisionally ionize their hydrogen .",
    "that fraction decreases with increasing radius .",
    "the enhancement is also a decreasing function of decreasing mass .",
    "thus we conservatively expect that our simple picture gives at most a factor of two overestimate of the optical depth , averaged over a reasonable sample of halos . at large optical depths , this error does nt affect the observed lyman  @xmath0line properties , and at low optical depths we may underestimate the observed line by up to that same factor of two .",
    "the practical output of our model is , given a halo mass @xmath57 at redshift @xmath58 , the radius , velocity , and mass of shells of igm matter surrounding the galaxy from its virial radius to a large radius .",
    "[ [ ionization - state ] ] ionization state + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to calculate the scattering of a lyman  @xmath0  emission line by the igm , we need to know the ionization state of the hydrogen , in addition to its density and velocity profile .",
    "we solve the ionization balance of the igm gas assuming two possible contributions , direct ionization by the galaxy emitting the lyman  @xmath0  line and , if the universe is ionized , a mean ionizing background .",
    "after calculating the density distribution around a halo using the prescription described in the previous section , we solve the ionization balance as a function of distance from the galaxy . in general ,",
    "the recombination rate of ionized hydrogen in the igm is relatively small . as a consequence , in the pre - reionized universe  regions around galaxies are not in equilibrium , but began growing when star - formation turned on and expand at the rate that ionizing photons can ionize more neutral igm ( rather than balancing recombinations within the ionized region ) .",
    "the  region is still expected to have a relatively sharp boundary , as the mean free path of ionizing photons in the neutral igm is small .",
    "after reionization , all of the igm is highly ionized by the mean ionizing background , but the direct ionizing flux of the galaxy provides an additional proximity effect on the ionization balance immediately around it .",
    "we divide the igm around into one or two regions : either the universe is reionized , in which case all of the igm is ionized ; or the universe is not reionized , in which case there is an  region in the igm immediately surrounding the galaxy , and the igm is fully neutral outside of that region . in that case",

    "both curves are for the fiducial galaxy.,width=317 ]      now we return to a discussion of the assumptions made in this paper and their possible consequences on our conclusions .",
    "first we discuss the possible effects of dust in a lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxy .",
    "if dust absorbs ionizing photons , then the star - formation rate in our models can simply be rescaled to take that into account . alternately , dust may extinct the lyman  @xmath0  line and uv continuum almost equally , but extinct the balmer lines considerably less . in this case",
    "the lyman  @xmath0line extinction can be estimated and corrected for .",
    "dust may also affect the uv continuum differently from the recombination emission , in the event that dust is distributed differently with respect to stars and  regions . in this case the extinction value measured by the balmer lines alone ( with an extinction curve ) may be used to correct the lyman  @xmath0  line , assuming that resonant photons are extincted no differently than non - resonant photons .",
    "dust extinction can cause great ambiguity in the interpretation of lyman  @xmath0  lines , even when uv continuum and balmer lines are measured , because resonant lyman  @xmath0  photons may be extincted differently from non - resonant uv continuum and balmer line photons .",
    "dust may extinct lyman  @xmath0  photons preferentially over uv continuum photons , due to the extra path - length through the galaxy that resonantly scattered photons travel before escaping .",
    "certain gas and dust geometries , however , may mitigate or even reverse that effect @xcite .",
    "there is no direct observable to measure this possible effect , except that an extinction - corrected sfr estimated from balmer lines does place an upper limit on the intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  line flux .",
    "more fundamental assumptions are associated with our model of the igm around lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxies .",
    "we assumed the presence of an accretion shock at the virial radius of the halo containing the galaxy ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if these galaxies have no accretion shock , as suggested by @xcite , then our conclusions are greatly changed .",
    "it is the presence of the accretion shock that generates the characteristic wavelength scale where line transmission begins ( see section  [ sec : igmmoddep ] ) . in the absence of a virial shock ,",
    "the infalling gas will eventually shock when it reaches the galaxy .",
    "the observed lyman  @xmath0  line would be suppressed blueward of that velocity , implying only intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  lines that were very redshifted with respect to the systemic redshift of the galaxy could be observed .",
    "another consequence of the lack of a virial shock is that lyman  @xmath0emission from the cooling of the igm gas would be located close to the galaxy @xcite , thus any observed lyman  @xmath0  line may have a contribution from contribution from cooling radiation as well as star - formation powered lyman  @xmath0 . if future observations show an extremely redshifted lyman  @xmath0  lines at high redshifts , this may be indicative of cooling radiation from igm gas falling unshocked down to the center of a halo .",
    "in section  [ sec : igmmodel ] we discussed our assumptions about the density distribution of the igm around the lyman  @xmath0  emitting galaxy .",
    "we calculate the ensemble - averaged igm density distribution ; even for the spherically - averaged density profile , deviations from this average are expected from galaxy to galaxy . additionally , we estimated that structure near the emitting galaxy has only a small effect on the density distribution of the igm .",
    "however , we did not address the effect of collapsed and collapsing structures on the velocity field of the igm , which is crucial ( more so than igm density ) to our predicted line profiles .",
    "numerical simulations may be used to estimate both the variance in the igm structure from galaxy to galaxy , and also the density and velocity distributions of the igm along the line of sight toward a galaxy accounting for substructure .",
    "we have calculated observed lyman  @xmath0  line profiles for high - redshift galaxies , with a focus on the prospects of using observed lyman  @xmath0  lines to probe the ionization of the universe at @xmath219 . toward this end",
    "we have investigated many of the parameters that influence the observed lyman  @xmath0  line from a high - redshift galaxy .",
    "we conclude that future measurements with _",
    "jwst _ may permit the estimation of igm neutral fractions at @xmath219 , but current @xmath2 data do not yet place a strong constraint on the neutral fraction at that redshift if we allow consideration of galactic winds .",
    "if we take at face value our estimates of the integrated lyman  @xmath0  transmission of the two @xmath2 galaxies for which estimation is possible , and assume our simplest model ( with no winds ) , we would conclude that the igm neutral fraction is @xmath220 at @xmath2 .",
    "interpretation of an observed lyman  @xmath0  line alone ( or even with a measurement of the uv continuum ) is extremely difficult , due to the host of parameters that influence it .",
    "however there is hope that with the rest - frame optical spectra that _ jwst _ will provide for high - redshift galaxies , lyman  @xmath0  emission lines will yet prove fruitful for constraining the reionization history of the universe at @xmath219",
