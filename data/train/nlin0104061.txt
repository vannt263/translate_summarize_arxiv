    "time - delay systems have attracted a lot of attention in recent years , in part due to the fact that multistability , i.e. the coexistence of multiple attractors , is a common occurrence when the delays are large typically , much larger than the response time of the system @xcite .",
    "interest in multistability arises because multistable systems play a key role in pattern recognition processes @xcite and memory storage devices . by choosing appropriate initial conditions , prescribed periodic solutions",
    "can be stored as oscillatory patterns of a time - delay system @xcite .",
    "synchronization of chaotic time - delay systems has also received attention , since it has potential applications to secure communications @xcite .",
    "perez and cerdeira @xcite have shown that , in low - dimensional chaotic systems , a hidden message can be unmasked by the dynamical reconstruction of the chaotic signal using nonlinear dynamical methods .",
    "encrypting a message in the chaotic output of a time - delay system has the advantage that the dynamics is in this case high - dimensional ( the dimension increases linearly with the delay @xcite ) but , in spite of this fact , synchronization can be achieved by transmitting a single scalar signal .",
    "unfortunately , this method is not as secure as initially expected , since it has been shown that by using a special embedding space , the delay time can be identified , and the message can be successfully unmasked @xcite .",
    "coupled oscillators with time delays in the coupling , which represent interactions being transmitted at finite speed , have been extensively studied as well @xcite .",
    "recently , a new effect of delayed coupling was reported by voss @xcite , who showed the existence of an anticipating synchronization regime . in this regime ,",
    "the slave system becomes synchronized to the chaotic future state of the master system .",
    "anticipation occurs when the coupling is delayed , and results from the interplay of memory effects and relaxation mechanisms .",
    "numerically , this regime was found in coupled semiconductor lasers with optical feedback @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the existence and stability of anticipated synchronization in coupled time - delay maps , which have the advantage of allowing for analytical calculations . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a system of two time - delay coupled maps in a master - slave configuration , and present analytical results on the stability of anticipated and retarded synchronization for generic maps . in section 3 , we apply the results to a delay map that arises from the discretization of the ikeda delay - differential equation .",
    "section 4 presents a summary and the conclusions .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional map of the form @xmath3 for @xmath4 , the first term in the right - hand side represents a relaxation mechanism . under its sole action",
    "@xmath5 would asymptotically vanish .",
    "this relaxation , however , competes with the effect of the nonlinear function @xmath6 , which has the form of a time - delayed feedback with delay @xmath0 .    the ( master ) map ( [ x ] ) is used to partially drive the evolution of a new ( slave ) system @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics of this system is , in principle , the same as for @xmath5 , except that a part of the nonlinear component is replaced by the evolution of @xmath5 , namely @xmath8 the parameter @xmath9 $ ] measures the strength of the driving action .",
    "note that @xmath5 enters the dynamics of @xmath7 with a delay @xmath1 .",
    "this form of unidirectional time - delay coupling is not only an extension to maps of the configuration proposed by voss for continuous - time systems @xcite , but also generalizes the master - slave interaction by introducing a parameter ( @xmath10 ) that controls its strength .",
    "voss s configuration corresponds to the extreme value @xmath11 .    the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ x ] ) and ( [ y ] ) suggests that , if driving is effective enough , @xmath7 may become synchronized to the driving signal , in the form @xmath12 if this synchronization is realized , the dynamics of @xmath7 coincides with that of @xmath5 up to a time shift @xmath2 . if @xmath13 the slave system anticipates the evolution of the master system , and we have anticipated synchronization . on the other hand , if @xmath14 the synchronization is retarded .",
    "linear stability of the synchronized state ( [ sync ] ) can be analyzed in the usual way .",
    "taking @xmath15 , the evolution of the deviation @xmath16 in the limit of infinitesimal deviations is readily derived from ( [ y ] ) : @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "note that , if @xmath4 and for @xmath11 , the deviation decreases exponentially with time and synchronization is therefore stable . in view of well - known properties of synchronization in coupled maps without delays , it is possible to advance that , if the dynamics of @xmath5 is chaotic , the synchronized state ( [ sync ] ) will be stable above a certain threshold @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath5 is nonchaotic , synchronization should be stable for any @xmath20 .    for @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) can be formally integrated by introducing a linear @xmath22-dimensional map for a variable @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "this equivalent map is given by @xmath25 where the elements of the matrix @xmath26 read @xmath27 the deviations given by eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) can then be obtained from the solution of the equivalent map , @xmath28 thus , synchronization is linearly stable if all the eigenvalues of the evolution matrix @xmath29 vanish for @xmath30 . for @xmath11",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath29 and its eigenvalues must be calculated numerically , since they involve the successive states of the variable @xmath5 , cf .",
    "( [ mat ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to point out that stability is determined by the asymptotic properties of @xmath29 in the limit @xmath33 , where the driving system @xmath5 has exhaustively explored the accessible region of phase space . in this limit , thus , the delay @xmath1 of eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) plays no role in the determination the eigenvalues of @xmath29 . in consequence",
    ", @xmath1 is irrelevant to the stability of the synchronized state .",
    "in this section we present numerical results corresponding to maps ( [ x ] ) and ( [ y ] ) , with @xmath34 . with this choice of @xmath6 , we refer to eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) as the ikeda delay map , since it arises from the discretization of the ikeda delay - differential equation @xcite , @xmath35 this equation was introduced to describe the dynamics of an optical bistable resonator , where the finiteness of the speed of light is relevant , and therefore require a description that incorporates explicitly the round - trip time of light in an optical cavity .",
    "physically , @xmath36 is the phase lag of the electric field across the resonator , @xmath37 is the laser intensity injected into the system , and @xmath38 is the round trip time of the light in the resonator .    writing",
    "@xmath39/ \\delta t$ ] , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , the ikeda delay map is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ik ] ) with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the ikeda delay map is not to be confused with the discrete ikeda map @xcite , which is obtained from ( [ ik ] ) by discretizing time in units of @xmath38 in the singular limit where the delay - to - response time ratio diverges .    in the following ,",
    "we focus the attention on the case @xmath45 .",
    "our numerical calculations are restricted to random initial condition in @xmath46 both for the master and the slave system . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we illustrate anticipated synchronization , for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the slave system ( dashed line ) anticipates in @xmath49 steps the state of the master system ( solid line ) . after a transient",
    ", the difference @xmath50 ( dotted line ) decays to zero .",
    "we have verified that this behavior is independent of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the critical value @xmath51 of the coupling strength , above which the synchronized state is stable , has been calculated from the analytical results of the previous section by means of a numerical evaluation of the matrix @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) .",
    "since the delay @xmath1 is irrelevant to this calculation , we can take @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ mat ] ) . from a given initial condition for the master system ,",
    "the matrix @xmath29 is evaluated for successive values of @xmath52 . in order to avoid the calculation of its eigenvalues , which is specially troublesome for large @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath29 is multiplied at each step by a randomly generated vector , @xmath53 , of unitary modulus . if , for a given value of @xmath10 , the modulus of the product remains above a certain upper threshold @xmath54 for sufficiently large @xmath52 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , synchronization is considered unstable and @xmath57 . if , on the other hand , @xmath58 for @xmath56 , where @xmath59 is a suitable lower threshold , synchronization is considered stable and @xmath60 . with this criterion ,",
    "@xmath51 can be found by decimation within the interval @xmath61 up to a certain previously fixed precision . in our calculations ,",
    "we have taken @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows @xmath51 as a function of the delay @xmath0 and for several values of the parameter @xmath65 .",
    "note that for small @xmath0 specifically , for @xmath66 the critical value @xmath51 can vanish , which indicates that the master evolution is nonchaotic .",
    "notice , furthermore , that for some values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 we have plotted more than one value of @xmath51 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in such cases , the master system is multistable with , typically , two chaotic attractors .",
    "the value of @xmath51 depends thus on the initial conditions for both @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "whereas the behavior is quite irregular for small @xmath0 , for larger delays the critical coupling becomes practically independent of @xmath0 .",
    "though it has not been possible to prove this analytically , we conjecture that @xmath51 approaches a finite limit below unity as @xmath67 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath65 in the investigated interval is also moderately weak . as expected , since the dynamics of the ikeda delay map becomes more irregular as @xmath65 grows i.e .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is higher @xmath51 increases accordingly .",
    "the degree of anticipated of retarded synchronization can be quantified by calculating the similarity function @xmath68 , defined as @xcite : @xmath69 ^ 2\\rangle } \\over { [ \\langle x_n^2\\rangle \\langle y_n^2\\rangle ] ^{1/2 } } } .\\ ] ] if @xmath5 and @xmath7 are independent time series with similar mean value and dispersion , the average of their square difference is of order @xmath70 , and thus @xmath71 . if , on the other hand , there is perfect anticipated or retarded synchronization , the difference @xmath72 vanishes , and @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the similarity function is shown for the same parameters as in fig . [ f1 ] .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows @xmath74 i.e .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath75 recorded during sufficiently long realizations of the evolution for a given set of parameters in the @xmath76-plane , with all the other parameters as in fig .",
    "the region where anticipated synchronization occurs , @xmath77 , is clearly visible for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "the position of its boundary is in good qualitative agreement with the values of @xmath51 shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] for @xmath78 .",
    "we have extended the study of anticipated synchronization , advanced by voss for unidirectionally coupled differential equations with time delays @xcite , to delayed coupled chaotic maps . while the nature of anticipated synchronization of maps and differential equations is the same , delay discrete - time dynamics admits an analytical treatment which can not be carried out for continuous - time systems .",
    "in fact , ordinary differential equations with finite time delays constitute an infinite - dimensional problem . on the other hand ,",
    "since times delays in maps must be discrete , the dimensionality of the problem remains finite .",
    "taking advantage of this situation , we have analytically studied the stability of anticipated and retarded synchronization in a generic master - slave configuration . in the absence of coupling , master and slave dynamics",
    "are identical and involve an intrinsic delay @xmath0 . coupling consists in the replacement of a part of the slave dynamics by that of the master system , with a delay @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the stability of synchronization is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the linearized problem , eqs .",
    "( [ delta]-[u ] ) , suggest meanwhile a strong though not transparent dependence on the lyapunov exponent of the master system , as expected . in practice",
    ", the linearized problem has to be treated numerically , but it only involves the realization of the master system and the successive application of the linear - evolution operator , being thus a purely algebraic process .",
    "these results have been applied to the ikeda delay map , which derives from the application of the euler integration scheme to the ikeda delay - differential equation .",
    "we have calculated the critical coupling intensity above which synchronization is stable , as a function of the delay @xmath0 and of a parameter @xmath65 that controls the chaotic dynamics of the map .",
    "it is found that , whereas for small values of @xmath0 the critical coupling can vary considerably due to the irregular appearance and disappearance of chaotic and nonchaotic attractors the dependence for large @xmath0 is much smoother . in fact , as @xmath0 grows , the critical coupling seems to approach a constant value .",
    "the dependence with the dynamical parameter @xmath65 is also moderate in the considered range .    in this work",
    "we have focused the attention on exact anticipated synchronization .",
    "however , it has been previously shown that approximate anticipated synchronization is possible in coupled differential equations , even in the absence of intrinsic delays @xcite .",
    "the study of approximate anticipated synchronization in coupled maps constitutes therefore a line for future work . in particular , it would be interesting to investigate in detail the connection between the degree of synchronization , and the irregularity of the dynamics as measured by the lyapunov exponents . for delay differential equations , the number of positive lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimension increase linearly with the delay , while the metric entropy remains roughly constant @xcite .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the metric entropy might be a good indicator of the possibility of synchronizing with anticipation , and thus predicting , chaotic dynamics .",
