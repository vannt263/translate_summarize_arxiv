    "although the perturbative higgs mechanism is a fundamental ingredient in the standard model of particle physics , there are still many unknowns in the study of the strongly coupled dynamics of the yang  mills  higgs system . in a seminal work",
    "@xcite , fradkin and shenker discussed the phase structure of gauge theories in the presence of higgs fields pointing out the important modifications in the spectrum of the theory as a function of the higgs field representation and the different regimes of the parameters of the theory , _",
    "i.e. _  the gauge coupling constant @xmath2 and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", in the case of higgs fields in the fundamental representation , fradkin and shenker were able to show that the higgs and the confining phases are smoothly connected .",
    "more precisely , from @xcite , one learns that these two phases are separated by a first order line transition which , however , does not extend to the whole phase diagram .",
    "instead , it displays an endpoint .",
    "this implies that the higgs phase can be connected to the confining phase in a continuous way , _",
    "i.e. _  without crossing the transition line .",
    "even more striking , there exists @xcite a region in the plane @xmath6 , called the analyticity region , in which the higgs and confining phases are connected by paths along which the expectation value of any local correlation function varies analytically , implying the absence of any discontinuity in the thermodynamical quantities . according to @xcite , the spectrum of the theory evolves continuously from one regime to the other .",
    "said otherwise , the physical states in both regimes are generated by suitable gauge invariant operators which , in the higgs phase , give rise to massive bosons , while , in the confining phase , to meson - like states ,",
    "_ i.e. _  to bound states of confined excitations .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we investigated the three - dimensional su(2 ) yang  mills ",
    "higgs theory by taking into account the nonperturbative phenomenon of the gribov copies @xcite which are present in the gauge fixing quantization procedure . in this framework , the dynamics of the model is analyzed through the study of the two - point correlation functions of the gauge fields .",
    "a yukawa - type behavior for the gauge propagator signals that the higgs phase takes place , while a propagator of gribov type @xcite means that the theory is in a confining phase .",
    "we remind here that a propagator of gribov type does not allow for a particle interpretation , as it exhibits complex conjugate poles . as such , it is suitable for the description of a confining phase .",
    "in particular , in the case of the fundamental representation for the higgs field , it was found @xcite that there were different regions in parameter space , _ i.e. _  depending on the values @xmath7 , with the two - point functions displaying a rather different behavior . at weak coupling , corresponding to sufficiently small @xmath2 and large @xmath1 , the yukawa - type propagators of the perturbative yang  mills",
    " higgs model were recovered . in some intermediate coupling region ,",
    "the two - point function still exhibits a pole on the axis of real @xmath8 and with positive residue , meaning there are still physical excitations present in the gauge sector . in this region a second unphysical pole with negative residue was also found . at strong coupling , _ i.e. _  large @xmath2 and sufficiently small @xmath1 , the effect of the restriction to the gribov region introduced deep modifications to the two - point functions .",
    "all physical poles disappeared and the two - point function was of the gribovtype , a feature which can be interpreted as signaling confinement .",
    "it is worth to mention here that the poles of the gluon propagator are continuous functions of the parameters @xmath7 . in this sense , the two regions , _",
    "i.e. _  the higgs and the confining phases , can be seen as being smoothly connected , in agreement with the general results of @xcite .",
    "we find it worthwhile to point out here that the fradkin - shenker predictions are settled in a discrete ( lattice ) version of the gauge - higgs models , though from the appendix of @xcite it is clear that the analyticity argument is built around taking the lattice coupling @xmath9 ( and thus lattice spacing @xmath10 ) , _ i.e. _  leading to a continuum limit .",
    "the present paper aims at generalizing this analysis to the case of @xmath11 , which is the gauge group of the electroweak interaction in the standard model .",
    "in addition to the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath1 and the @xmath12 gauge coupling constant @xmath2 , we have now a third parameter @xmath3 corresponding to the @xmath13 factor . the three - dimensional case considered here can be used as a kind of effective description to study the four - dimensional electroweak sector at very high temperatures in the spirit of dimensional reduction @xcite . as in the previous paper",
    ", we study the behavior of the two - point functions of the gauge fields after restricting the path integral to the gribov region .",
    "these two - point functions can then help to uncover information about the elementary excitations present in the theory at different values of the coupling constants .",
    "our analysis uncovers a very rich behavior of the two - point functions . in all , we distinguish four regions in parameter space , as depicted in  [ regionsdiag ] . at weak non - abelian coupling @xmath2 ,",
    "the propagators are all unmodified from the usual perturbative higgs case , and we recover massive @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons , and a massless photon . for intermediate values of the non - abelian coupling constant @xmath2 , the behavior of the two - point functions depends very much on the @xmath13 coupling @xmath3 . for sufficiently strong @xmath13 coupling @xmath3 ,",
    "the @xmath5 bosons are removed from the spectrum , and the two - point function of the off - diagonal fields only has poles away from the axis of real @xmath8 . in this region the @xmath4 boson and the photon are unaffected by the gribov horizon and behave as in the perturbative higgs case . at weak @xmath13 coupling @xmath3 , but still intermediate non - abelian coupling @xmath2 , there is a small region in parameter space where the @xmath5 bosons are removed as in the previous case , and where the two - point functions of the diagonal @xmath12 field and of the abelian field are modified by the gribov horizon , resulting in three massive poles on the axis of real @xmath8 , two of which have the positive residue necessary to merit the interpretation of a physical excitation . at all other values of the couplings all two - point functions",
    "are modified , and we only find one excitation with real mass - squared .",
    "all other poles in the two - point functions are away from the axis of real @xmath8 , and can thus , at best , be interpreted as confined .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "higgs theory under consideration . in section [ sect3 ]",

    ", it is easy to see that at least the infinitesimally connected gauge copies can be dealt with by restricting the domain of integration in the path integral to the so called gribov region @xmath45 @xcite , defined as the set of all transverse gauge configurations for which the faddeev  popov operator is strictly positive , namely @xmath46 the region @xmath45 is known to be convex , bounded in all directions in field space , to contain the zero gauge field , and to have gauge orbit intersecting it .",
    "all these properties to our knowledge only proven in the landau gauge , whence the interest in this gauge make @xmath45 well - chosen as integration domain .",

    "@xmath45 has been worked out by gribov in his original work .",

    "popov operator @xmath48 .",
    "one requires that @xmath49 has no poles at finite nonvanishing values of @xmath50 , so that it stays always positive .",

    "i.e. _  one remains inside @xmath45 .",
    "the only allowed pole is at @xmath51 , which has the meaning of approaching the boundary of the region @xmath45 . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", the no - pole condition was linked in a more precise fashion to the zwanziger implementation of the gribov restriction @xcite , thereby making clear their equivalence .",
