    "the analysis of fourth and higher order partial differential equations is a subject of rising interest in riemannian geometry .",
    "this interest is motivated by the successful resolution of a number of key issues involving second order equations , such as the yamabe problem and the prescribed scalar curvature problem , which are linked to an elliptic second order equation , and evolution problems such as the ricci flow , the mean curvature flow , or the yamabe flow .",
    "these problems , which have motivated the development of geometric analysis , have higher order counterparts , and it is natural to wonder how far the known results extend .",
    "moreover , if a number of second order equations are now very well understood in dimensions two and three , it seems that in higher dimensions , equations of higher order behave better , because they are more suited to the context , or carry more regularity .",
    "for example , it appears that a lot of second order issues are in some way related to the einstein - hilbert functional , a crucial invariant for surfaces .",
    "the yamabe problem consists in minimizing this functional in a given conformal class , and the ricci flow can be seen as its gradient flow , by adding extra dimensions or by keeping a measure fixed ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the same spirit",
    ", fourth order equations often appear in relation with some quadratic curvature functional , linear combination of : @xmath2 or equivalently of : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the riemann , weyl , traceless ricci and ricci curvature tensors , @xmath8 is the scalar curvature , and the norms are taken by considering them as double - forms ( see section [ subsec : operators ] ) , e.g. @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "let also define : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the weyl - schouten tensor and @xmath13 is the second symmetric function of the eigenvalues of a symmetric 2-tensor @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 plays an important role in conformal geometry , see for example @xcite .",
    "these functionals are particularly interesting in dimension four , as it is the only dimension for which they are scale invariant . following berger s idea of finding best metrics on a manifold @xmath16 by minimizing @xmath17",
    ", lebrun initiated the study of minimizers of @xmath18 in dimension four ( @xcite ) .",
    "there has also been much work lately on critical metrics for these functionals , which are solutions of quasilinear fourth order equations . in dimension four , in particular ,",
    "much attention is paid to the gradient of @xmath19 known as the bach tensor .",
    "note that for this particular dimension , according to the gauss - bonnet formula : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the euler - poincar characteristic of @xmath16 , and it follows that @xmath19 and @xmath22 only differ by a constant and are both conformal invariants .",
    "we can also write @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the q - curvature of branson , which has good conformal properties ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if einstein metrics are the only critical points for the normalized einstein - hilbert functional , there is another important class of metrics in dimension four , namely the scalar - flat anti - self - dual one , that are critical for quadratic functionals .",
    "it would suggest that those functionals do not carry as much rigidity as the einstein - hilbert one .",
    "however , in dimension three , gursky and viaclovsky proved that the critical points for @xmath25 with @xmath26 are exactly the constant curvature metrics ( @xcite ) .    in dimensions greater than five",
    ", there is no information to wait from minimizers , as there exists metrics of volume @xmath27 on any manifold such that the functional @xmath18 is arbitrarily small ( see @xcite section 11.3.3 ) .",
    "given the spectacular advances made on the ricci flow , a natural approach to obtain critical metrics consists in performing the gradient flow associated to the functional .",
    "several higher order gradient flows have been successfully carried out during the last decade .",
    "in addition to the flows on curves and surfaces , mantegazza has studied flows of four and higher order on immersed hypersurfaces in @xcite , brendle has introduced a fourth order equivalent of the yamabe conformal flow in @xcite , chen and he have obtained results for the calabi flow on khler manifolds in @xcite . as for",
    "the gradient flows of the quadratic functionals we are interested in , zheng has considered the gradient flow of @xmath28 in dimension three in @xcite , and streets has studied the gradient flow of @xmath18 in dimension four in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained by mantegazza in @xcite , where he was motivated by approximating singular flows by higher order ones , suggest that it is useful to increase the order of the equation with the dimension in order to get regularity .",
    "indeed , for his class of flows , he showed that singularities can not occur provided that the order of the equation is larger than @xmath29 + 1)$ ] .    in this paper",
    ", we study a class of fourth order flows on compact manifolds , which includes the gradient flows for quadratic curvature functionals whose gradient becomes strongly elliptic when the deturck trick is applied , and in particular , it includes the flows of zheng and streets .",
    "some of the ideas and tools used to study the ricci flow naturally extend to these higher order flows .",
    "we prove short - time existence using the deturck trick , and prove bando - bernstein - shi type estimates in order to study singularities .",
    "the lack of maximum principle for fourth order equations is overcome by an extensive use of integral estimates .",
    "then @xmath30 estimates come from sobolev inequalities .",
    "since we have to bound a sobolev constant along the flow in order to get the estimates , a special kind of singularity can appear , where the injectivity radius goes to zero while the curvature stays bounded .",
    "this could not happen in the ricci flow , for which the curvature blows up at any singularity .",
    "this phenomenon of collapsing with bounded curvature can also appear for sequences of renormalized flows near a point where the curvature blows up .",
    "it has been ruled out for the ricci flow by the non - collapsing result of perelman ( see @xcite ) , that ensures that it is always possible to take a limit of such blowing - up sequences .",
    "but in our situation , we have no entropy similar to that of perelman for the ricci flow .",
    "moreover , none of the methods used to study other higher order flows apply in this setting .",
    "for instance , the universal sobolev - type inequality of michael and simon used by mantegazza only works in the context of hypersurfaces .",
    "the only situation in which it was possible to rule out collapsing with bounded curvature is when the flow starts very close ( in the @xmath0 sense ) to a flat metric or to the sphere :    for all positive constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 , there exists a positive constant @xmath33 such that if @xmath34 is a compact riemannian @xmath1-manifold with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then the gradient flow of @xmath18 starting from @xmath39 exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to a flat metric .    in the theorem , @xmath40 denotes the sobolev constant defined by : @xmath41    we recall that if @xmath34 is a complete riemannian @xmath42-manifold , @xmath43 , the yamabe invariant of @xmath44)$ ] ( @xmath45 $ ] conformal class of @xmath39 ) is defined by : @xmath46 if @xmath16 is compact , then @xmath47 and @xmath48\\bigr\\}.\\ ] ]    there exists a constant @xmath49 such that if @xmath34 is a compact riemannian @xmath1-manifold satisfying @xmath50 then the gradient flow of @xmath18 starting from @xmath39 exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to either the sphere or the real projective space .    in this paper",
    ", we deal with the issue of collapsing with bounded curvature by controlling the yamabe invariant .",
    "when we assume a positive lower bound on it , the metric can not collapse with bounded curvature .",
    "moreover , if the curvature blows up , we show that we can apply a compactness result to a sequence of renormalized flows near a singularity , and prove that a subsequence converges to a `` singularity model '' .    in particular , in dimension four , such a positive lower bound exists on the yamabe invariant as soon as the yamabe invariant and the mean q - curvature are positive , as it was pointed out by streets in @xcite .",
    "we show that these conditions are uniformly satisfied for the gradient flows of a number of quadratic functionals , assuming a bound on the initial energy .",
    "it implies that these flows only develop singularities where the curvature blows up , and that blowing - up sequences converge ( up to a subsequence ) to a `` singularity model '' , namely a complete bach - flat , scalar - flat manifold .",
    "moreover , we prove a rigidity result for those model manifolds and show that if the initial energy is less than an explicit bound , then no singularity can occur . under those assumptions",
    ", the flow exists for all time , and converges up to a subsequence to the sphere or the real projective space .    in @xcite , chang , gursky and",
    "yang proved the following result for pinched @xmath1-manifolds :    [ thm : cgy ] let @xmath34 be a compact riemannian @xmath1-manifold . if @xmath51 and @xmath52 then @xmath16 is diffeomorphic to @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "note that according to the gauss - bonnet formula , the pinching assumption in this theorem can also be written : @xmath55    this theorem is a `` conformal '' version of a result due to margerin ( @xcite ) . as a matter of fact , the assumptions in the theorem of chang , gursky and yang do not depend on the metric we choose on the conformal class of the initial metric .",
    "this fact allows them to perform a conformal transformation on the initial metric in order to exhibit a metric in the same conformal class which satisfies the pointwise pinching of margerin .",
    "this is done by using some fully nonlinear equations .",
    "despite the fact that margerin s result is based on the ricci flow to produce a metric of constant curvature , chang , gursky and yang do nt provide a direct proof of the existence of such a metric .    in this article , we give a direct proof of the existence of a metric of constant curvature under slightly stronger assumptions ( see corollary  [ cor : pinching ] ) .",
    "our proof is more natural as it only relies on the study of a geometric flow .",

    "we prove short - time existence for the flows we introduce . in section 3",
    ", we show that the gradient flows of quadratic functionals belong to our class of equations . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove a rigidity result in dimension four for metrics that are critical for the functionals @xmath56 defined in the introduction . in section 5",
    ", we prove that collapsing with bounded curvature can not occur if the yamabe constant is bounded away from zero . in section 6 , we prove bando - bernstein - shi type estimates on the curvature . in section 7",
    "we present a compactness result for the solutions of our flows . in section 8 , we prove the main results of the paper . finally , section 9 is devoted to some technical results , useful all along the paper , and which are not directly specific to geometric flows .",
