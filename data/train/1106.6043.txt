    "@xcite explored the potential of sdss photometry to produce accurate photometric metallicities for metal - poor stars in the halo of the milky way .",

    "nevertheless , even when @xmath8-band data is lacking , @xmath9,@xmath10 , and @xmath11 photometry can still provide very useful photometric metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our problem is made easier because we are only interested in the relative ( not absolute ) metallicities of the two populations . at the same time , unlike @xcite and @xcite , we have the added benefit of 2mass @xmath12 photometry in the _ kepler _ field and apparent magnitude range . as a result , we can use infrared colors ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) as a proxy for effective temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic - * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) provides reasonably accurate estimates of @xmath14 , so we can ensure that giant stars do not contaminate our control sample of stars with no detected planets . stars with",
    "@xmath15 have main sequence lifetimes much longer than 10 gyr , and because age has little effect on the colors of low - mass stars on the main sequence , age differences between the two populations ( if they exist ) are unlikely to affect our analysis . since we compare dwarf stars with similar @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the only stellar parameter that can vary between the _ kepler _ ec hosts and the control sample is [ fe / h ] .",
    "as metallicity is the only stellar parameter that can vary , the best explanation for systematically red @xmath1 colors in the ec host population relative to the control sample is that the ec host population is enriched in metals .      for each of the 997 stellar hosts of the 1,235",
    "_ kepler _ exoplanet candidates announced in @xcite , we obtain all available broadband photometry ( including 2mass @xmath12 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and reddening data from the kic .",
    "simultaneously , we obtain equivalent photometry and reddening data from the same sources for a random sample of 10,000 dwarf stars from the @xmath2 stars observed during q1 and q2 of the _ kepler _ mission with no candidate planets and kic - based @xmath16 .",
    "this control sample is subject to the same selection effects that were applied in the _ kepler _ field to produce a list of stars to search for transiting planets .",
    "consequently , differences in the characteristics of the stars in the control sample and the stars that host ecs are not related to the selection effects applied in the _ kepler _ field to identify a sample of stars suitable for transit observations .",
    "metal - rich stars typically have redder optical colors than solar metallicity stars , as the forest of iron lines in the atmospheres of metal - rich stars preferentially absorb blue photons . at the same time",
    ", there are other factors that affect the color of a star , most notably reddening due to the interstellar medium , its age , and its evolutionary state ( e.g. , dwarf or giant ) .    in figure  [ fig01 ]",
    ", we plot a @xmath0@xmath1 color - color plot for the control sample and the ec host sample .",
    "we subdivide the ec host sample into two sub - samples : those stars that host at least one giant ec ( e.g. , @xmath17 ) and those stars that host no giant ecs .",
    "we use padova isochrones @xcite for a 2 gyr stellar population at [ fe / h ] = -0.1 and 0.1 to determine the effect of metallicity on the stellar locus in a @xmath0@xmath1 color - color plot .",
    "the yellow arrows show the effect of increasing [ fe / h ] by 0.2 dex on @xmath1 at constant @xmath0 .",
    "note though that the yellow arrows do not connect stars of constant mass , as a 0.2 dex [ fe / h ] enriched star will be about 5% more massive than a solar metallicity star at constant @xmath0 color .",
    "we do not use the padova isochrone redward of @xmath18 , as the theoretical stellar models and atmospheres become unreliable after that point ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , we use the m  67 fiducial sequence from @xcite to illustrate the morphology of a solar metallicity population at red @xmath0 color .",
    "age can also affect the color of main sequence star , though near @xmath5 age has little effect on the main sequence .",
    "giant stars have slightly bluer @xmath1 colors than dwarf stars at constant @xmath0 , so the presence of giant stars in the control sample could in principle produce a color offset between the _ kepler _ ec host population and the control sample .",
    "fortunately , kic - based @xmath14 estimates are accurate enough to ensure that giant stars are at most a few percent of our control sample @xcite .",
    "two trends are immediately apparent in figure  [ fig01 ] .",
    "first , at @xmath19 typical of late k dwarfs , giant ecs become very rare relative to smaller ecs .",
    "we interpret this as evidence in support of the correlation between host stellar mass and likelihood of hosting a giant planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , at @xmath20 dominated by late k dwarfs , ecs are preferentially found around the reddest part of the stellar locus as defined by the control sample .",
    "we quantify the significance of this latter trend in figure  [ fig02 ] .    to determine the significance of the observation that low - mass stars that host ecs are on average redder in @xmath1 than the stellar locus as defined by the control sample , we bin both the control sample and each sub - sample of ec hosts into 0.16 mag bins in @xmath0 color and compute the mean and median @xmath1 color in that bin .",
    "we estimate the error in each mean and median by bootstrap resampling .",
    "we find that at @xmath21 characteristic of solar - type stars , giant ec hosts have preferentially red @xmath1 colors at the 4-@xmath4 level relative to the control sample . on the other hand , at that same @xmath0 color ,",
    "the hosts of small ecs are indistinguishable from the control sample .",
    "in addition , at @xmath22 the stars that host small ecs are 4-@xmath4 redder in @xmath1 than the control sample .",
    "we summarize the results of our calculations in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we argue that the significant color offsets apparent in figure  [ fig02 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] are the result of the enriched metallicity of the ec host sample . indeed , it reassuring that we identify the hosts of giant ecs as significantly red in @xmath1 at constant @xmath0 , as it is well established that the stellar hosts of giant planets are preferentially metal rich ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other possible explanations for the observed offset are selection effects , differential reddening , systematic age differences between ec hosts and the control sample , and the presence of giant stars in the control sample but not the ec host sample .",
    "the depth of a transit is proportional to @xmath23 , so it is easier to identify the signal of transiting planet around a small star . on the main sequence",
    ", both age and metallicity can affect the radius of a star . according to the padova isochrones for a 2 gyr population @xcite , at @xmath24 a star with [ fe / h ] = 0.1",
    "is about 5% larger than a star with [ fe / h ] @xmath25 and the same @xmath0 color . at @xmath5 , a star with [ fe / h ] = 0.1",
    "is about 7% larger than a star with [ fe / h ] @xmath25 and the same @xmath0 color . according to the padova isochrones , at @xmath24 a 5 gyr",
    "old star is about 6% larger than a 2 gyr old star at the same @xmath0 color . at @xmath5 ,",
    "a 10 gyr old star is about 2% larger than a 2 gyr old star at the same @xmath0 color .",
    "consequently , if there were no correlation between host metallicity and probability of hosting a planet or possible tidal destruction of aged exoplanet systems , transit surveys would be more likely to identify transiting planets around young , metal - poor stars . as we show in section 2.2.3 , age on the main sequence",
    "has very little effect on the @xmath1 color of a star at constant @xmath0 , so these effects are not likely to produce the color offsets we observe .",
    "the @xmath1 color offset at constant @xmath0 color that we observe between the _ kepler _ ec host sample and the control sample is only meaningful if the two samples were subject to the same selection effects .",
    "as we argued in section 2.1 , both samples were selected according to the same _ kepler _ target selection algorithm . to verify that the two samples are similar",
    ", we plot in figure  [ fig03 ] six color - color plots and two color - magnitude diagrams ( similar to * ? ? ? * ) . in all cases ,",
    "the control sample outlines the distribution of both the sample of giant ec hosts and the sample of small - radius ec hosts .",
    "the ec hosts that are outliers in each panel may be unequal mass binary star systems or systems with poorly - estimated reddening .",
    "the _ kepler _ ids ( koi numbers ) of a few of our most extreme color outliers are : 1161345 ( 984 ) , 2446113 ( 379 ) , 5356593 ( 644 ) , 8162789 ( 521 ) , 10470206 ( 335 ) , 10514430 ( 263 ) , and 11465813 ( 771 ) .",
    "in short , the age or metallicity of the host star of an exoplanet does not significantly affect the probability of detecting a transiting planet , and our control sample is a reasonable control sample for our measurement of relative color offsets .",
    "we therefore conclude that selection effects are unlikely to produce the color offsets we observe in figure  [ fig02 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] .      reddening due to",
    "the interstellar medium can affect the observed color of a star . in our differential analysis , this will only affect our result if the reddening of the control sample is systematically different than the reddening of the _ kepler _ ec host sample . fortunately , figure  [ fig04 ] indicates that control sample is subject to the same reddening distribution as the ec host sample .",
    "like the ec host sample , the control sample is also spread more or less uniformly over the _",
    "kepler _ field , so any angular dependence on reddening is unlikely to produce a significant color offset between the control sample and the ec host sample .",
    "we therefore conclude that differential reddening between the control sample and the _ kepler _ ec host sample is unlikely to produce the color offsets we observe in figure  [ fig02 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] .      as stars age on the main sequence , their colors can evolve . according to the padova isochrones , at @xmath24",
    "a 5 gyr old star is about 0.1% redder in @xmath1 than a 2 gyr old star at the same @xmath0 color . at @xmath26 , a 10 gyr old star is about 0.5% bluer in @xmath1 than a 2 gyr old star at the same @xmath0 color .",
    "clearly , colors of stars do not evolve significantly on the main sequence .",
    "tidal evolution in exoplanet systems can destroy close - in planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "transit surveys are strongly biased towards close - in systems , so it is possible that transit surveys may be biased towards young stars , as tidal evolution may have already destroyed planets that once orbited older stars . assuming that planets arrive in the close proximity of their host star on nearly circular orbits and that the timescale for eccentricity damping is very short , then the timescale for tidal disruption is approximately ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath27 \\mathrm{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the initial semimajor axis of the planet before tidal evolution , @xmath29 is the specific dissipation function of the host star , @xmath30 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath31 is the mass of the planet , and @xmath32 is the radius of the host star . if tidal evolution efficiently destroys planets in the _ kepler _ sample , then the hosts of _ kepler _ ecs may be preferentially younger than stars in the control sample .",
    "the median period of giant ecs is 13 days , while the median period of small - radius ecs is 10 days .",
    "as we plot in figure  [ fig05 ] , the timescale for tidal disruption of such systems is in excess of 100 gyr . at the same time , as we showed above , age has little effect on the @xmath1 color of a main sequence star at constant @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore conclude that systematic age differences between the control sample and the _ kepler _ ec host sample or tidal evolution in ec systems are unlikely to produce the color offsets we observe in figure  [ fig02 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "giant stars have stellar radii @xmath33 , and because transit depth is proportional to @xmath23 , the transit of a planet with radius @xmath34 in front of a giant star with @xmath35 is about 10,000 times harder to detect than the transit of the same planet in front of a dwarf star with radius @xmath36 . as a result , _ kepler _ is unlikely to identify transiting planets around giant stars , so the sample of _ kepler _ ec hosts is very likely free of giant stars .",
    "while we only used stars with kic - based @xmath37 in our control sample , it is possible that a few percent of the stars in our control sample are giant stars @xcite .",
    "giant stars have slightly bluer @xmath1 colors at constant @xmath0 color than dwarf stars , so the presence of a significant number of giant stars in our control sample could explain the 0.08 mag @xmath1 color offset we observe at @xmath5 between the sample of _ kepler _ ec hosts and our control sample .    to investigate the affect of significant giant star contamination in our control sample , we obtain all available broadband photometry ( including 2mass @xmath12 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and reddening data from the kic for a sample of stars observed by _ kepler _ during q1 and q2 with kic - based @xmath38 .",
    "the stars in this sample are likely giant stars .",
    "recall that the 10,000 stars in our control sample have kic - based @xmath37 , so we can add stars from the sample of likely giant stars to our original control sample of likely dwarf stars to create giant star contaminated versions of our our control sample . in particular , we create four versions of the giant star contaminated control sample with differing levels of contamination : 30% , 10% , 5% , and 3% contimination . to determine the @xmath1 color offsets expected at constant @xmath0 color between a sample of 997 dwarf stars ( the number of _ kepler _ ec hosts )",
    ", we create a sample of 997 dwarf stars by randomly selecting 997 stars from the original , not - intentionally contaminated control sample .",
    "as before , we compute the mean @xmath1 color in bins of constant @xmath0 color for each of the five samples described above .",
    "we plot the result of this calculation in figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "we find that between 10% and 30% of the stars in our control sample of stars with kic - based @xmath37 would need to be giants to reproduce the 0.08 mag offset in @xmath1 at @xmath5 we observe between the hosts of _ kepler _ ec and our original not - intentionally contaminated control sample .",
    "the level of contamination is at least a factor of a few larger than the level of contamination found in the kic by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig06 ] indicates that a giant star contaminated control sample would have redder @xmath1 color at @xmath39 than control sample of dwarf stars ( very much like the likely hosts of _ kepler _ ecs ) .",
    "we do not observe this effect in figure  [ fig02 ] . indeed , the hosts of _ kepler _ ecs are redder than the control sample at @xmath39 . at the same time",
    ", the presence of giant stars has no effect on the @xmath1 color of our sample at @xmath40 .",
    "for that reason , the presence of giant stars in our control sample can not explain the significant color offsets we observe between the hosts of giant _ kepler _ ecs and our original control sample .",
    "we therefore conclude that contamination of our control sample by giant stars is unlikely to produce the color offsets we observe in figure  [ fig02 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we use two methods to transform the @xmath1 color offsets we observe in figure  [ fig02 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] into approximate metallicity offsets .",
    "first , we use dereddened fiducial sequences for the open clusters m  67 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath41 and age @xmath42 gyr ) and ngc  6791 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath43 and age @xmath44 gyr ) in the sloan photometric system from @xcite plotted in figure  [ fig07 ] . in this case , the fiducial sequences show that at constant @xmath45 , the metal - enriched ngc  6791 fiducial sequence is @xmath46 mag redder in @xmath1 than the solar metallicity m  67 fiducial sequence .",
    "though these two clusters have different ages , the stars with @xmath47 have main - sequence lifetimes much longer than 10 gyr and therefore should still be on the main sequence in both clusters .",
    "consequently , the @xmath46 mag offset in @xmath1 between the two fiducial sequences is likely a result of the @xmath48 dex offset in [ fe / h ] between the two clusters .",
    "accordingly , at constant @xmath47 it seems that @xmath49 } = 0.1 $ ] results in @xmath50 .    to transform the @xmath0 colors of the points in figure  [ fig02 ] and table  [ tbl-1 ] into @xmath51",
    ", we use a 2 gyr solar metallicity padova isochrone . to more",
    "precisely estimate the average @xmath1 offset between the m  67 and ngc  6791 fiducial sequences , we calculate the difference between the fiducial sequences at three points ( @xmath51 = 5.9 , 6.4 , and 6.8 corresponding to @xmath0 = 0.46 , 0.54 , and 0.62 ) and average the result . in this way , we find that in the interval @xmath52 , an offset of 0.1 dex in metallicity results in an offset of 0.035 mag in @xmath1 .",
    "this method is only applicable to stars with @xmath53 , so in table  [ tbl-1 ] we only give the metallicity offsets indicated by this method for the three reddest @xmath0 bins in our analysis .    in order to transform a @xmath1 color offset into a metallicity offset for more massive stars , we use padova isochrones .",
    "in particular , we use two gyr isochrones for two metallicities ( [ fe / h ] = -0.1 and 0.1 ) to determine the change in @xmath1 color at constant @xmath0 attributable to a 0.2 dex increase in metallicity .",
    "we use the two isochrones to determine the offset in @xmath1 at constant @xmath0 that can be attributed to metallicity , then use that @xmath1 offset to convert the observed @xmath1 offsets in table  [ tbl-1 ] into metallicity offsets ( extrapolating if necessary ) .    interestingly , even in the presence of possible systematics in our analysis ( e.g. , differential reddening , age differences , or the possible presence of giant stars in the control sample ) , it is reassuring that we recover the fact that solar - type stars that host giant planets are metal enriched relative to the field population . in figure",
    "[ fig08 ] , we plot @xmath13 and metallicity for both a volume - limited sample of stars ( @xmath54 20 pc ) from the geneva - copenhagen survey ( gcs - * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and confirmed giant planet hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the horizontal lines give the average metallicities of the two populations .",
    "the vertical arrows are at the @xmath55 corresponding to @xmath0 = 0.22 and 0.30 .",
    "the arrows are anchored at the mean metallicity of the gcs sample , and their length corresponds to the metallicity offset we need to explain the differences in @xmath1 color we observe in the giant planet bins at those @xmath0 colors reported in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "reassuringly , the metallicity offsets we compute based on @xmath1 color offsets are in quantitative agreement with previous observations of metal - enhancement in giant planet hosts . in other words ,",
    "our analysis is quantitatively correct in the regime where it is possible to compare with previous results .",
    "that is suggestive that our result for the low - mass stars that host small - radius _ kepler _ ecs is also reliable .",
    "we identified three properties of the _ kepler _ ecs in section 2 :    1 .   the population of solar - type stars that host giant ecs is 4-@xmath4 redder by 0.04 mag in @xmath1 at constant @xmath24 than a control sample of stars observed by _ kepler _ but with no detected planets .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the @xmath1 color offset is the result of a 0.2 dex enhancement in [ fe / h ] of the low - mass hosts of small - radius _ kepler _ ecs , then the third observation supports the tentative assertion put forth in @xcite that m dwarfs that host low - mass planets are more likely to be metal rich than expected based on random sampling of the field m dwarf population .",
    "the observation that there is a correlation between host star metallicity and the presence of low - mass planets around low - mass stars is expected in the core - accretion model of planet formation . in that scenario , the cores of neptune - mass planets ( and possibly super - earths ) form and",
    "grow to several earth masses before their parent protoplanetary disk is fully dissipated . to first order , the mass of a protoplanetary disk scales as @xmath56 and the fraction of the disk in solid material scales as @xmath57 .",
    "the total amount of solids in a disk able to form the core of a neptune - mass planet is then @xmath58 .",

    "if the probability of forming a planet is proportional to the total amount of solids in its parent protoplanetary disk , a late k dwarf with @xmath60 would need to have a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath61 to have the same chance of forming a planetary system as a solar metallicity solar - type star . as a result",

    "though comparing stars at constant @xmath0 color forces us to compare stars of slightly different masses , the magnitude of this effect on the planet formation process is likely an order of magnitude smaller than the effect of a 0.2 dex enhancement in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the correlation between the red optical color of late k dwarfs and probability of hosting a small ec indicates that _ kepler _ might boost its yield of planets by shading their late k dwarf sample to redder optical colors . in particular",

    "stellar models and fiducial sequences in the sloan photometric system of the galactic open clusters m  67 and ngc  6791 indicate that a 0.2 dex enrichment in [ fe / h ] of the ec host population can produce the offset .",

    "<S> we find that _ kepler _ exoplanet candidate ( ec ) host stars are preferentially metal - rich , including the low - mass stellar hosts of small - radius ecs . </S>",
    "<S> the last observation confirms a tentative hint that there is a correlation between the metallicity of low - mass stars and the presence of low - mass and small - radius exoplanets . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we compare the @xmath0@xmath1 color - color distribution of _ kepler _ ec host stars with a control sample of dwarf stars selected from the @xmath2 stars observed during q1 and q2 of the _ kepler _ mission but with no detected planets . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at @xmath3 characteristic of solar - type stars , the average @xmath1 color of stars that host giant ecs is 4-@xmath4 redder than the average color of the stars in the control sample . at the same time , the average @xmath1 color of solar - type stars that host small - radius ecs is indistinguishable from the average color of the stars in the control sample . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that at @xmath5 indicative of late k dwarfs , the average @xmath1 color of stars that host small - radius ecs is 4-@xmath4 redder than the average color of the stars in the control sample . </S>",
    "<S> these offsets are unlikely to be caused by differential reddening , age differences between the two populations , or the presence of giant stars in the control sample . </S>",
    "<S> stellar models suggest that the first color offset is due to a 0.2 dex enhancement in [ fe / h ] of the giant ec host population at @xmath6 , while sloan photometry of m  67 and ngc  6791 suggests that the second color offset is due to a similar [ fe / h ] enhancement of the small - radius ec host population at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations are a natural consequence of the core - accretion model of planet formation . </S>"
