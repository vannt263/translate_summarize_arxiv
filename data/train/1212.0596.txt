    "astronomical observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of the order of @xmath8  g ; see refs .",

    "understanding the origin of these fields is one of the challenging questions of modern astrophysics . generally speaking",
    ", there are two popular scenarios .",
    "the first one envisages the generation of magnetic fields through different astrophysical mechanisms .",
    "more precisely , it is assumed that an initially tiny magnetic field is produced through a battery mechanism @xcite .",
    "the correlation length of such a field is limited by galactic length scales . the second scenario to explain the origin of the magnetic field in galaxies and clusters presumes that the observed magnetic fields were amplified from cosmological weak seed magnetic fields @xcite . in this case",
    "the correlation length of such a seed field might be as large as the horizon scale today if we admit that the field has been generated during inflation .",
    "there are different possibilities for seed magnetic field amplification ranging from a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) dynamo to the adiabatic compression of magnetic field lines during structure formation @xcite .",
    "galactic magnetic fields are usually measured through the induced faraday rotation effect @xcite and , as mentioned above , the field magnitude is of the order of a few @xmath9 g at typical scales of @xmath10kpc .",
    "the primordial magnetic energy density contributes to the radiation field , and thus the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) bound implies @xmath11 @xcite if the magnetic field has been generated prior to bbn . if the correlation length of the magnetic field is much larger than @xmath12  mpc , smaller limits on the magnetic field energy density arise from the cosmological data , making @xmath13 a few @xmath14 g ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a correlation length - dependent lower limit on magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) could be derived from gamma - ray observations of blazars @xcite . in the limit of large correlation lengths , @xmath12mpc , the bound is at the level of @xmath15 g ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussions on possible uncertainties in the measurements of blazar spectra ) .",
    "it is possible , in principle , that the igm magnetic fields are of primordial origin .",
    "another possibility is that the fields are spread through the igm by outflows from galaxies at late stages of the evolution of the universe . to distinguish between these two possibilities",
    ", it is important to identify measurable characteristics of the igm magnetic fields which are different in the two cases and to study the possibility of measuring such characteristics .    in this paper",
    "we consider the observational properties of igm magnetic fields expected if the fields originate from cosmological phase transitions ( pt ) such as the electroweak ( ew ) and qcd pts @xcite .",
    "some scenarios of magnetic field generation during ewpt or qcdpt also produce magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "we follow the evolution of fields from the epoch right after the magnetogenesis up to the present day epoch .",
    "our approach is different from that adopted in the previous studies , which mostly concentrated on the analysis of the range of possible field strengths at a pre - defined scale of interest ( e.g.1mpc ) .",
    "instead , we study the evolution of field characteristics that are most relevant for measurements using radio and gamma - ray astronomy . specifically , we are interested in the evolution of the magnetic energy density @xmath16 , which determines the characteristic field strength @xmath17 , and the characteristic correlation scale ( integral scale ) @xmath18 at which the field reaches the strength @xmath19 .    the present day integral scale depends on the temperature @xmath20 and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath21 at the moment when the primordial magnetic field is generated .",
    "these parameters determine the maximal allowed value of the magnetic energy density injected in the pt plasma , as well as the initial correlation length of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we do not separately consider the effect of helicity transfer related to the chiral anomaly , which might be important in the presence of strong magnetic fields at temperatures above 10100mev @xcite .",
    "such a transfer could be considered as part of the magnetogenesis process which could persist all the way down to the temperature scale of the qcd phase transition .",
    "we only use fundamental physical laws , such as conservation of energy , and how the magnetic field interacts with the cosmological plasma through mhd turbulence , and do not make any assumption about the physical processes responsible for the primordial magnetic field generation .    in sec .",
    "ii we give an overview of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the primordial magnetic field .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in sec .",
    "iii , where we discuss the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we employ natural units with @xmath22 and gaussian units for electromagnetic quantities .",
    "we assume that the phase transition - generated magnetic fields satisfy the causality condition @xcite .",
    "the maximal correlation length @xmath23 for a causally generated primordial magnetic field can not exceed the hubble radius at the time of generation , @xmath24 .",
    "hence @xmath25 , where @xmath26 can be associated with the number of primordial magnetic field bubbles within the hubble radius , @xmath27 .",
    "the comoving length ( measured today ) corresponding to the hubble radius at generation is inversely proportional to the corresponding pt temperature @xmath20 , @xmath28 and is equal to 0.5 pc for the qcdpt ( with @xmath29 and @xmath30 gev ) and @xmath31 pc for the electro weak phase transitions ( ewpt ) ( with @xmath32 and @xmath33 gev ) , and the comoving primordial magnetic field correlation length @xmath34 .",
    "this inequality assumes _ only _ the expansion of the universe without accounting for mhd turbulence ( free turbulence decay or an inverse cascade if a helical primordial magnetic field is present ) .",
    "we also note that the number of pt bubbles within the hubble radius is around 6 ( @xmath35 ) for qcdpt and around 100 ( @xmath36 ) for ewpt .",
    "so the maximal correlation length @xmath23 is equal to 0.08pc for qcdpt and @xmath37pc for ewpt .",
    "the maximal value of the primordial magnetic field energy density must satisfy the bbn bound , i.e.  the total energy density of the primordial magnetic field at nucleosynthesis @xmath16 ( where @xmath38 should not exceed @xmath39 of the radiation energy density @xmath40 . in any case , the magnetic field is generated by mechanical motion of charged particles , so that its energy density could constitute only a fraction of matter energy density , which is at most comparable to the radiation energy density in the radiation dominated universe .",
    "note that the maximal value of the effective magnetic field is independent of the temperature at generation @xmath41 , and depends only very weakly on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the moment of generation .    in what follows we are mostly interested in the evolution of the energy density of the magnetic field and the length scale which gives the dominant contribution to the energy density ( the `` integral scale '' ) during the course of cosmological evolution . taking this into account we adopt the following idealizing approximation .",
    "we generate an initial primordial magnetic field by solving the mhd equations for a certain time during which an external electromagnetic force is applied that is proportional to a delta function that peaks at the characteristic scale @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to a magnetic field with correlation length @xmath43 . in this approximation",
    "the characteristic magnetic field strength at the scale @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "we justify our assumption that @xmath43 should be identified with the size of the largest magnetic eddies by noting that the primordial magnetic field is involved in mhd processes driven by turbulence .",
    "it is natural to assume that the typical length scale of the magnetic field generated during the pts is determined by the pt bubble size .    the dynamical evolution of the coupled magnetic field ",
    "matter system leads to a spread of magnetic field over a range of scales .",
    "the resulting power spectrum of the magnetic field at small wavenumbers ( or , equivalently , large distance scales ) has the form of a power - law @xmath45 with a normalization constant @xmath46 and a slope of the two - point correlation function of the magnetic field , @xmath47 , with the spectral function @xcite @xmath48 here @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the antisymmetric tensor , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the magnetic energy and helicity spectra . ]",
    "@xmath53 . in particular",
    ", a white noise power spectrum corresponds to @xmath54 @xcite , while the batchelor spectrum corresponds to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the power law spectrum extends up to a time - dependent integral scale @xmath56 above which the power contained in the magnetic field decreases rapidly due to turbulent decay and/or viscosity damping .",
    "several previous studies , see @xcite and references therein , describe the primordial magnetic field in terms of a smoothed ( over length scale @xmath57 ) magnetic field @xmath58 with @xmath59 . knowing @xmath60 and the slope of the power spectrum",
    ", one can calculate the strength of the smoothed magnetic field at any scale of interest @xmath57 @xcite : @xmath61 the smoothed magnetic field might be of interest in the context of certain problems .",
    "for example , the strength of a magnetic field smoothed over a scale @xmath62mpc is considered to be relevant in the context of seed magnetic fields for galactic dynamos .",
    "it is , however , important to note that @xmath58 is strongly @xmath53 dependent for a given value of @xmath57 . in particular , for causally - generated magnetic fields with @xmath63 there is significant `` magnetic power '' only at small scales , and for @xmath64 mpc the value of @xmath65 is extremely small @xcite . at the same time , it does not imply that the magnetic field itself is weak .",
    "in fact , it could be as strong as @xmath66  g , close to the bound imposed by the bbn @xcite . only in the case of a scale invariant magnetic field with @xmath67 ,",
    "generated for example during inflation @xcite , @xmath68 is independent of @xmath57 and @xmath53 , and is equal to @xmath19 .",
    "note that sometimes ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( 8) in @xcite ] , instead of calculating @xmath58 through @xmath69 , the smoothed value of the magnetic field is determined through the normalization constant @xmath46 of the power spectrum as @xmath70 .",
    "after generation , the evolution of the primordial magnetic field is a complex process affected by mhd as well as by the expansion of the universe @xcite . in our description , to account for the expansion of the universe we make use of the fact that conformal invariance allows for a description of mhd processes in the early universe by simply rescaling all physical quantities in terms of their comoving values and using the conformal time @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "after this procedure the mhd equations include the effects of the expansion while retaining their conventional flat spacetime form .",
    "the magnetic evolution process strongly depends on initial conditions , as well as on the physical conditions of the primordial plasma .",
    "we need to determine the scaling laws for the following magnetic field characteristics : ( i ) magnetic energy density , ( ii ) correlation length , and ( iii ) magnetic helicity . the magnetic energy and magnetic helicity spectra",
    "are related through the realizability condition , @xmath72 @xcite . for the total magnetic energy @xmath73 and helicity @xmath74",
    "we get @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the comoving magnetic eddy correlation length ( which corresponds to the physical integral scale @xmath18 ) , initially set by the temperature at the magnetic field generation moment @xmath77 ; see eq .",
    "( [ lambda - max ] ) , and is independent of the presence of magnetic helicity .",
    "both helical and non - helical magnetic fields experience large - scale mhd decay resulting in an increase of the correlation length with a corresponding decrease in the magnetic energy density at large scales ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "the time rate of this process depends strongly on the presence of magnetic helicity @xcite . taking this into account",
    ", we consider the cases of helical and non - helical magnetic fields separately .",
    "as noted above , the initial magnetic field configuration is given by a sharply peaked spectral energy density .",
    "the coupling between primordial magnetic field and plasma , which ensures the spreading of the fixed scale primordial magnetic field over a wide range of length scales , forms a modified magnetic field spectrum within a few turnover times ( see ref .",

    "@xcite @xcite or even by a flatter kazantsev spectrum , @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "however , here we consider the case of a cosmological magnetic field for which the correlation length is strongly limited by the hubble horizon .",
    "] so that the power contained in the large - scale modes is very small , while the total magnetic energy density is sufficiently large .",
    "mhd processes also are responsible for the generation of fluid perturbations when an initial magnetic field is present .",
    "these processes finally result in equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energy densities @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the magnetic field , the velocity field has a white noise spectrum , i.e.@xmath79 with @xmath80 due to the possible presence of longitudinal modes . to describe adequately the evolution of fluid motions coupled to the magnetic field we need to solve the complete set of mhd equations ;",

    "the magnetic field decay is strongly dependent on the presence of magnetic helicity .",

    "we would like to note that our numerical simulations allowing the longitudinal forcing , see @xcite , show a white noise spectrum for the velocity field as a final configuration . under these conditions ,",

    "an equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energies could be reached over the distance range @xmath92 . in the final configuration",
    "the equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies is a consequence of the coupling between magnetic and velocity fields . ] ] the growth of the magnetic field up to equipartition with the fluid on large scales is somewhat similar to the phenomenon of an `` inverse cascade '' of the magnetic power spectrum .",
    "note however that the source of power in the inverse transfer of non - helical magnetic fields is different from the power source in the case of helical fields . in the case of non - helical fields , the power in the large wavelength modes increases due to the presence of a large power reservoir in the form of the turbulent motions of the plasma in the same wavelength range .",
    "by contrast , in the case of helical fields , the power on large scales grows due to the transfer of power from the shorter wavelength modes .",
    "apart from the transfer of power from the plasma motions to the magnetic field at large scales , another effect of evolution of plasma and magnetic field perturbations is the turbulent decay of the power at short length scales due to the phenomenon of the direct turbulent cascade . at a given moment of time",
    "@xmath71 , this phenomenon leads to suppression of power in velocity and magnetic field modes on scales smaller than the size of the largest processed eddy .",
    "the size of the largest processed eddy is determined by the condition @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the characteristic velocity of the plasma motions on the scale @xmath57 . from the definition of the kinetic energy power spectrum through the velocity two - point correlation @xmath95 one finds that characteristic velocity @xmath96 on the distance scale @xmath97",
