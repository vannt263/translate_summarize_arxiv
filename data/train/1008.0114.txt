    "were used to define knot and link invariants including some enhancements of the quandle counting invariant . in @xcite a generalized notion of rack modules defined in terms of trunks was introduced .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a modified form of the rack algebra for racks with finite rack rank and use the resulting representations into modules over finite rings to define new enhancements of the rack counting invariant @xmath5 from @xcite .",
    "these new enhancements specialize to @xmath5 but are able to distinguish many knots and links with the same @xmath5 values , and hence are strictly stronger invariants .",
    "we provide examples which demonstrate that the new enhanced invariants can distinguish knots with the same jones and alexander polynomials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ rb ]",
    "we review the basics of racks and the rack counting invariant . in section [ ram ]",
    "we define the rack algebra and resulting rack modules . in section [ rinv ]",
    "we use finite rack modules to define new enhancements of the rack counting invariant . in section [ comp ] we give examples and describe our methods of computation of the new invariants . in section [ q ]",

    "as shown below , the operation @xmath6 denotes a crossing from right to left given the positive direction of the over - crossing strand .",
    "conversely , the operation @xmath7 denotes a crossing from the opposite direction .",
    "@xmath8    if we regard @xmath9 as two labels on arcs in a knot diagram , as shown below , we see that axioms ( i ) and ( ii ) correspond to reidemeister moves ii and iii .",
    "@xmath10    the equivalence relation on knot diagrams generated by the reidemeister ii and iii moves is known as _",
    "regular isotopy _ , and labelings of links by racks are preserved by regular isotopy moves .",
    "rack colorings are also preserved by the _ blackboard framed type i moves _ , which preserve the writhe or _ blackboard framing _ :    @xmath11    @xmath12    every tame blackboard - framed oriented knot or link @xmath13 has a _ fundamental rack _",

    "if we wish to specify explicitly the writhe vector or blackboard framing vector of @xmath13 , we will write @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the writhe of the @xmath18th component of @xmath13 .    for a given framed link @xmath13 and rack @xmath1 ,",
    "the number of rack labelings of the arcs in @xmath13 by rack elements is an invariant of framed isotopy known as the _ basic counting invariant _",

    "in this section we recall and slightly reformulate the notions of the rack algebra and rack modules from @xcite .",

    "we would like to define an associative algebra @xmath0 $ ] determined by @xmath1 .",
    "one way to do this is to modify the @xmath24-rack structure described in section [ rb ] , giving each pair @xmath25 its own invertible @xmath26 and generic @xmath27 .",

    ". let @xmath13 be a fixed knot or link diagram with a fixed rack labeling by @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to consider secondary labelings of @xmath13 by elements of the rack algebra @xmath0 $ ] . in @xcite",
    "these secondary labels are pictured as `` beads '' on the strands of the knot or link .",
    "the basic bead - labeling rule is the usual @xmath24-rack rule , with the exception that the beads at a crossing use the specific @xmath26 and @xmath27 associated to the rack labels on the right - hand underarc and overarc as illustrated .",
    "@xmath32    @xmath33    we would like to find the conditions required to make labelings of a rack - labeled diagram by rack algebra elements invariant under rack - labeled blackboard framed isotopy .",
    "we will then define the rack algebra @xmath0 $ ] by taking a quotient by the ideal @xmath31 generated by the elements we must kill to obtain invariance under @xmath1-colored blackboard framed reidemeister moves . in @xcite the special case where @xmath1 is a quandle , i.e. a rack of rack rank @xmath34 , is considered . to extend this definition to the case of racks with finite rank @xmath35 ,",
    "the reidemeister moves we need are the standard type ii and iii moves together with the framed type i moves and the @xmath2-phone cord move .",
    "the reidemeister ii and blackboard framed reidemeister i moves do not impose any conditions due to our choice of crossing rule : @xmath36    the reidemeister iii move gives us three conditions which we recognize as indexed versions of the @xmath24-rack conditions : @xmath37 comparing coefficients on @xmath38 , we must have @xmath39 @xmath40 finally , for defining counting invariants we will need @xmath2-phone cord move compatibility .",
    "@xmath41 going though the @xmath18th kink multiplies our rack algebra element by a factor of @xmath42 , so @xmath2-phone cord invariance requires that the product of these factors must equal 1 : @xmath43    thus , we have :    @xmath44    @xmath45 ,    @xmath46 ,    @xmath47     @xmath48    [ rem : ext ] @xmath49    for the purpose of enhancing the rack counting invariant , we want to find examples of finite rack modules .",
    "probably the simplest way to achieve this is the following : let @xmath1 be a finite rack and let @xmath50 be a finite ring with identity , e.g. @xmath51 or , for a non - commutative example , the ring @xmath52 of @xmath53 matrices over @xmath51",
