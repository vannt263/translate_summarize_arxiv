    "the maximal triangulation is unique , but the minimal one is not : after choosing the diagonal in @xmath37 the rest of the polygon @xmath21 can be triangulated in many ways . from the above discussion regarding @xmath33",
    "we see that we could independently triangulate each of the two halves of @xmath25 with any number of tetrahedra from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",

    "no triangulation of @xmath25 has more than @xmath48 tetrahedra .",
    "on the other hand , there are mismatching dissections of @xmath25 with @xmath47 tetrahedra .",
    "let @xmath38 be a triangulation of @xmath25 .",
    "it is an easy application of euler s formulas for the 3-ball and 2-sphere that the number of tetrahedra in a triangulation of any 3-ball without interior vertices equals the number of vertices plus interior edges minus three ( such formula appears for instance in @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , we claim that if @xmath59 is an interior edge in a triangulation @xmath38 , then the triangle @xmath60 appears in @xmath38 .",
    "this is so because there is a plane containing @xmath59 and having @xmath61 as the unique vertex on one side .",
    "at the same time the link of @xmath59 is a cycle going around the edge .",
    "hence , @xmath61 must appear in the link of @xmath59 .",
    "it follows from the above claim that the number of interior edges of the form @xmath59 in @xmath38 equals the number of vertices of @xmath21 other than @xmath31 and @xmath30 in the link of @xmath22 . in a similar way",
    ", the number of interior edges of the form @xmath62 in @xmath38 equals the number of vertices of @xmath21 other than @xmath9 and @xmath29 in the link of @xmath23 . in other words , if we call @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( the @xmath65 , @xmath66 in the index and of the vertices are reversed , because in this way @xmath67 is monotone with respect to @xmath23 , and @xmath68 with respect to @xmath22 ) , then the number of interior edges in @xmath38 incident to exactly one vertex of @xmath21 equals @xmath69 .",

    "the sequence of vertices of @xmath21 ordered in the direction of @xmath22 , can have a pair of consecutive vertices contained in @xmath68 only where there is a horizontal edge in @xmath68 or in the at most two discontinuities of @xmath68 .",
    "this is true because @xmath21 is a regular @xmath15-gon .",
    "we denote @xmath76 the number of horizontal edges in @xmath68 and @xmath77 this number plus the number of discontinuities in @xmath68 ( hence @xmath78 ) .",
    "every non - horizontal edge of @xmath68 produces a jump of at least two in the @xmath22-ordering of the vertices of @xmath25 , hence we have    @xmath79    analogously , and with the obvious similar meaning for @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,    @xmath82    since @xmath83 can be completed to a triangulation of @xmath21 , and exactly four non - interior edges of @xmath21 are horizontal or vertical , we have @xmath84 , i.e.@xmath85 .",

    ", the gap between sizes of the maximal dissection and maximal triangulation is linear on the number of vertices .",
    "three remarks are in order : first , the size of the maximal triangulation for @xmath25 may depend on the coordinates or , more specifically on which diagonals of @xmath21 intersect the tetrahedron @xmath89 .",

    "it should be mentioned that a simple variation of the ideas in @xcite provides enough equations for an integer program whose feasible vertices are precisely the @xmath375-vectors of dissections .",
    "the incidence vectors of dissections of @xmath376 , for a point set @xmath363 , are just the @xmath375 solutions to the system of equations @xmath377 , where @xmath368 s are the incidence vectors for every regular triangulation @xmath38 of the gale transform @xmath378 ( regular triangulations in the gale transform are the same as chambers in @xmath363 ) .",
    "generating all these equations is as hard as enumerating all the chambers of @xmath363 .",
    "nevertheless , it is enough to use those equations coming from placing triangulations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
