    "the launch of @xmath0 satellite in late 2004 has brought about a new era in the field of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . more than 95% of the @xmath3 @xmath0 grbs reported each year had their afterglows detected in x - rays and about 60% detected in the optical , which in turn led to a large fraction of @xmath0 grbs having redshift determination and detailed studies @xcite .",
    "new questions have also arisen as the cases of well - observed afterglows keep accumulating , which pose new challenges to the standard grb afterglow model ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "one of these puzzles is the occasional lack of an optical light curve ( lc ) behavior synchronous to a lc break of the x - ray afterglow that usually indicates the end of a shallow decay phase ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "the incredible brightness of grbs makes them excellent probes of the distant universe , e.g. , to explore the dust extinction properties of their host environments .",
    "typical attempts involve fitting the afterglow spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with template extinction laws , although a more sophisticated approach based on a parameterized model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "most studies favor a small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction law @xcite .",
    "however , the broad 2175-  bump characteristic of the milky way ( mw ) extinction law ( also marginally appearing in that of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ) , whose physical carrier remains a long - standing mystery @xcite , was recently identified in a small number of grbs @xcite .    in this paper , we present the observations of the @xmath0 grb 060912a optical afterglow , which shows a lc behavior inconsistent with that of the x - ray one , and possible evidence of a 2175-  host dust extinction feature in the sed .",
    "the gamma - ray and x - ray properties of the grb are summarized in  [ sec - he ] .",
    "our ground - based observations and the telescopes used , as well as the @xmath0 ultra - violet and optical telescope ( uvot ) data that are extracted from the official online catalogue , are described in  [ sec - oa ] .",
    "combined analysis of the optical and x - ray data are detailed in  [ sec - pla ] , within the context of the standard afterglow model and energy injection hypothesis while also revealing discrepancies to the models .",
    "an optical - to - x - ray sed is built in ",
    "[ sec - sed ] , and the presence of the 2175-  feature is argued for through extinction template fitting after an simplified correction for h lyman absorption .",
    "a discussion on the implications of our results is given in ",
    "[ sec - dis ] .",
    "grb 060912a triggered the @xmath0 burst alert telescope ( bat ) and konus - wind @xcite .",
    "its single - pulse lc lasted for a duration of @xmath4  sec , and hence a long burst as confirmed by spectral lag analysis @xcite and by its star - forming host galaxy at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the bat data were fitted with a power - law spectrum of a photon index @xmath5 and a fluence of @xmath6  erg  @xmath7 @xcite . the rest - frame",
    "@xmath8 may be @xmath9  kev according to @xcite ( based on an empirical @xmath10 correlation ; see also @xcite ) . assuming a high - energy index of between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the isotropic luminosity is @xmath13  erg , satisfying the amati relationship within @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite )    @xcite re - analyzed the x - ray afterglow data of the grb as observed with the @xmath0 x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , independent of the preliminary results of @xcite . for the time - integrated xrt spectrum ( @xmath15  kev ] )",
    ", they obtained a photon index of @xmath16 before @xmath17  sec and of @xmath18 after that , correcting for absorption by both the galaxy and the host galaxy . the fitting h - column density assuming a solar metallicity was @xmath19  @xmath7 at @xmath2 for the host galaxy and about @xmath20  @xmath7 for the galactic value in the grb direction .",
    "we reproduce in figure 1 ( _ open circles _ ) the xrt lc as reduced by those authors , which consists of an early deep decay before @xmath21  sec , a late deep decay after @xmath22  sec , and a plateau in between .",
    "the three lc segments can be fitted using power law @xmath23 separately , with the power - law indices being @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which is consistent with the smoothed broken power - law model results in that paper .",
    "the 0.8-m tsinghua - naoc telescope ( tnt ) at the xinglong observatory automatically observed the grb upon receiving the gcn alert . the telescope is equipped with standard johnson - cousin @xmath27 filters and a princeton instrument @xmath28 ccd , resulting a field of view of @xmath29 . for the details of the xinglong grb follow - up system , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the tnt observation started @xmath30  sec earlier than the uvot and lasted for more than 3.7  hr .",
    "it began with a preset sequence of unfiltered exposures , i.e. , in a @xmath31 band , and was later switched to the filtered bands .",
    "extra observations were made with a 60-cm telescope .",
    "the afterglow was detected in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , but not in the @xmath1 and @xmath33 bands .",
    "the observation results are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf in a standard routine , bias subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "differential psf photometry was performed using 8 reference stars , which were calibrated in a photometric night . since the response curve of our ccd peaks in the @xmath32 band",
    ", we used the @xmath32-band magnitudes of the reference stars for the @xmath31 band and assumed that the so - derived afterglow magnitudes are equivalent to @xmath32-band ones .",
    "our independent photometric tests with stellar objects have shown this to be a decent assumption , introducing a typical scatter of only @xmath34 mag .",
    "the 1.5-m telescope of maidanak observatory is located at the south - east of uzbekistan .",
    "its follow - up observations were made in both the @xmath32 and @xmath1 bands from about 3 to 6 hours after the grb onset under favorable weather and seeing of @xmath35 , using an site @xmath36 ccd with a field of view of @xmath37 .",
    "the data were reduced in the same way as the xinglong data , using the same set of reference stars and photometric calibrations .",
    "the results are also listed in table 1 .",
    "about 5.5  hr after the grb , the afterglow was also caught by the roper / photometrics ch360 ccd camera ( site @xmath38 chip ) , which was mounted in parallel with the optima - burst instrument on the 1.3-m skinakas observatory telescope at crete , greece @xcite .",
    "the field of view of the ccd camera is @xmath39 .",
    "again the data were reduced in the same way as the xinglong data and included in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath0 uvot photometry in table 1 was derived using data extracted from the official online uvot grb afterglow catalogue @xcite .",
    "the uvot started observing the grb since @xmath40  sec after the bat trigger .",
    "a fading afterglow was detected in the @xmath41-@xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath1 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 bands , but not in the bluest @xmath45 band . when needed we combined raw data of neighboring epochs , taking both the coincidence loss corrected source count rate and background count rate , to make signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) larger than 3 .",
    "but in the @xmath1 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 bands we had to keep the data with @xmath46 which could mean a marginal detection .",
    "the @xmath41 observations lasted till very late time , @xmath47 days in the @xmath42 band , @xmath48 days in the @xmath41-@xmath31 band , and @xmath49 day in the rest . from the very late - time detections , which are not included in table 1 , we derived host - galaxy brightness of about @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  mag in the @xmath42 , @xmath41-@xmath31 , and @xmath43 bands , respectively .      as shown in figure 1 , the flux of the optical afterglow decayed smoothly following a single power law in all bands and throughout the whole observation period , including the x - ray plateau phase .",
    "this is best demonstrated by the well - sampled @xmath32-band lc .",
    "the fitting power - law indices @xmath53 of the flux evolution @xmath54 are all similar , i.e. , @xmath55 for @xmath32 , @xmath56 for @xmath33 , @xmath57 for @xmath1 , @xmath58 for @xmath42 , @xmath59 for @xmath43 , and @xmath60 for @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath32-band lc was built using both the genuine @xmath32-band observations and the unfiltered tnt observations which have been approximately reduced to the @xmath32-band .",
    "but the maidanak and skinakas @xmath32-band data after 10,000  sec were not included in the fitting process due to the relatively large scatter among the data .",
    "the late - time photometry must have been contaminated to some extent by the light of the host galaxy , which has been found by @xcite to be one of the brightest for grbs .",
    "those authors measured @xmath61  mag , while using the host - galaxy spectrum published by them we derived @xmath62  mag .",
    "the optical lcs after subtracting the host galaxy contribution can also be well fitted by a single power law , with the slopes of each band slightly steeper but closer to one another , than before the subtraction .",
    "specifically , we obtained @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the values are also similar to those of the x - ray lc before and after the plateau phase .",
    "the optical afterglow did not evolve in synchronism with x - rays , being lack of any lc features that would correspond to the two breaks defining the beginning and end of the x - ray plateau .",
    "similar behaviors were also observed in a few other bursts detected in the @xmath0 era , e.g. , grb 050319 @xcite and grb 070420 @xcite .",
    "there have been many theoretical discussions ( e.g. , @xcite ) on that deviation to the standard afterglow model , but no satisfactory interpretation so far .",
    "it has become well known that the x - ray plateau phase can not be understood with the standard afterglow model @xcite .",
    "the standard model gives a shallow lc decay only if @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the minimum synchrotron frequency and @xmath69 the cooling frequency ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the model decay index @xmath70 may be similar to @xmath25 of grb 060912a , but the model photon index @xmath71 is clearly inconsistent with the observed @xmath16 .    during the x - ray plateau phase of the grb , the x - ray frequency must be @xmath72 , while the optical one @xmath73 is probably between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , in the context of both the x - ray and optical afterglows coming from the same forward - shock synchrotron radiation process . the model spectral index @xmath74 as a function of the electron index @xmath75 is @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , and in between either @xmath80 ( slow cooling ) or @xmath81 ( fast cooling ) .",
    "the expressions are the same between the standard model and its extension to include the energy injection scenario or that for the @xmath82 case ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the following section indicates that the intrinsic optical spectral index is probably @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the optical photons must come from a model spectral segment different from that of the x - rays . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath73 can not be @xmath84 since it is highly unlikely that the extinction was so large as to make a positive intrinsic @xmath85 .",
    "finally , to reconcile the spectral index @xmath80 between @xmath68 and @xmath69 with the observed @xmath86 would require an electron spectrum of @xmath87 which is too steep .",
    "the x - ray plateau of the grb may be explained using the energy injection model , which assumes an energy injection rate proportional to @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) @xcite . since @xmath90",
    ", we obtain @xmath91 by equating @xmath76 with @xmath92 , which is most reasonable for an astronomical relativistic electron spectrum .",
    "the model predicts that @xmath93 , and hence @xmath94 .",
    "such a small @xmath95 seems close to the case of energy injection due to pulsar spin - down @xcite , and is consistent with the average value of @xmath96 found by @xcite for their @xmath0 sample .",
    "the x - ray lc and spectrum after the plateau phase as the energy injection has ended also suggests an electron index of @xmath97 . the observed @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath18 satisfy the closure relationship @xmath98 only if @xmath77 , in which case the standard model has @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "however , the energy injection hypothesis is not applicable to the simultaneous fast optical lc decay observed throughout the x - ray plateau phase . only for",
    "the slow - cooling case of the wind scenario , the model lc between @xmath68 and @xmath69 can decay faster than @xmath77 .",
    "but the model prediction , @xmath101 , would compare with the observation , i.e. , @xmath102 , only if @xmath103 , contradicting the above estimate of @xmath94 as constrained by the observed @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we select @xmath106  sec to build the optical - to - x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , shown in figure 2 as _ filled squares_. around the epoch , observational data can be found in the largest number of photometric bands .",
    "the host - subtracted magnitudes are listed in table 2 . the small flux change between the real data epoch and @xmath106  sec has been corrected for , adopting the lc power - law indices as given in ",
    "[ sec - opt ] , as well as a small galactic reddening of @xmath107 . for the @xmath1 and @xmath44 bands of no host measurement",
    ", we assumed that the intrinsic afterglow flux should be @xmath108  mag fainter than the total , taking the host - subtracted results in the other bands as references .",
    "the optical magnitudes were converted into monochromatic fluxes using the conversion factors and effective frequencies taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flux is drawn at 1.73  kev in the figure , with _ dotted lines _ indicating spectrum uncertainties .    for comparison",
    ", we built also the sed at @xmath109  sec ( figure 2 ; _ open squares _ ) .",
    "only the optical data in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath42 bands and the x - ray data were used in order to avoid large uncertainties caused by host galaxy contamination and data interpolation .    by power - law",
    "fitting , we obtained an optical - to - x - ray spectral index of @xmath110 for both epochs .",
    "first , the grb clearly does not belong to the `` optically '' dark bursts ( @xmath111 ; @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , at @xmath106  sec the optical fluxes in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands fall much below the optical - to - x - ray fitting power law , suggesting either strong dust extinction in the host galaxy or hydrogen lyman line absorption .",
    "we further suggest that the intrinsic spectrum of the optical afterglow during the x - ray plateau phase is probably shallower than @xmath112 and hence the optical band lies between @xmath68 and @xmath69 at the epoch .",
    "if we instead assume an intrinsic optical spectral index equivalent to the x - ray one , the extinction - corrected @xmath113 will still be considerably larger than @xmath114 for any of the mw ( @xmath115 ) , lmc ( @xmath116 ) , and smc ( @xmath117 ) extinction laws . a special artificially fine - tuned flat extinction law would be required to make the optical - to - x - ray sed as steep as the x - ray spectrum itself , which is beyond the scope of this paper ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the flux loss caused by h lyman absorption was @xmath118  mag in the @xmath44 band and @xmath34  mag in the @xmath43 band .",
    "most absorption probably occurred in the host - galaxy damped - ly@xmath53 system that gave rise to the large x - ray @xmath119 of @xmath120  @xmath7 , as estimated by us assuming a voigt line profile taking into account thermal - doppler broadening and natural broadening .",
    "the intergalactic hydrogen contributed only @xmath121  mag in @xmath44 and @xmath122  mag in @xmath43 at @xmath2 , according to the formulae of @xcite . in our calculations , when doing flux integration , a power law spectrum of @xmath123 was assumed and the @xmath41 filter response curves of @xcite were adopted .    in the 700-sec sed , the @xmath1-band flux falls well below both the @xmath33 band flux and the @xmath42 band one , which seems to suggest the interesting possibility of a 2175- dust extinction feature from the host galaxy .",
    "one could argue that the @xmath33-band flux may be overestimated since it looks larger than the @xmath32-band one .",
    "but we note that it is also above the simple interpolation from the @xmath32-band to the @xmath42-band , so evidence of extra extinction in the @xmath1-band is unambiguous .",
    "such a feature is characteristic of the dust extinction law of the mw , displaying a full width of @xmath124   @xcite .",
    "it does not exist in the extinction law of the smc , while being rather modest in the lmc one @xcite . at @xmath2 , it is almost entirely located in the observer - frame @xmath41 @xmath1-band @xcite .",
    "we tested the three dust - extinction laws on the 700-sec optical sed , with the results shown in the @xmath125 of figure 2 .",
    "note that the @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands have been corrected for the h lyman absorption , after which the optical sed ( _ filled squares _ ) can be fitted with a power law of index @xmath126 . as discussed above",
    ", the afterglow model predicts an intrinsic spectral index @xmath85 , i.e. , after correction for dust extinction , of either @xmath127 ( fast cooling ) or @xmath80 ( slow cooling ) , i.e. , @xmath128 assuming @xmath129 .",
    "thereafter , we took @xmath130 as the reference value of @xmath85 and reproduced it with the extinction - corrected optical sed by adjusting the reddening value @xmath131 .",
    "the results are @xmath132 for the mw extinction law , @xmath133 for the lmc case , and @xmath134 the smc .    as shown in the figure ( _ filled circles _ ) , the mw - like extinction well corrects the observed flux deficiency in the @xmath1 band .",
    "this is just as expected and in stark contrast to the cases of lmc ( _ open circles _ ) and smc ( _ open suares _ ) .",
    "note that here we did not use the common minimum-@xmath135 approach to constrain the extinction .",
    "a minimum power - law fitting @xmath135 were obtained for a much smaller @xmath131 , resulting in a corrected optical sed too steep to comply with the general afterglow model and a reasonable extension to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "a mw - like dust extinction law may also be supported by the fact that the host galaxy is one of the brightest among long grbs ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "brighter galaxies tend to have an evolved stellar population and higher metallicity . after correcting the published host galaxy spectrum for redshift , we synthesized its absolute @xmath1-band magnitude and obtained @xmath136 even before extinction corrections .",
    "so the galaxy must have metallicity near or even higher than the solar value , or @xmath137 according to the @xcite @xmath138-@xmath139 relationship for @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "it is significantly higher than most grb host galaxies ( @xmath141 ; @xcite ) , lmc ( @xmath142 ) , and smc ( @xmath143 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath144 , is smaller than the empirical values of the mw , lmc , and smc , just as the other grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the grb is not optically dark , it may belong to the `` dim '' category of optical afterglows as defined by @xcite and @xcite . using the two fitting lcs shown in figure 1 , we derived the host - subtracted observer - frame @xmath32-band magnitude at @xmath145hr of @xmath146 , corrected for the galactic extinction .",
    "this was then converted to a rest - frame 12-hr @xmath32-band luminosity assuming the observed optical sed of @xmath147 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "finally , after the host - galaxy extinction of @xmath148 ( mw - like law ) was corrected for , we obtained an intrinsic afterglow luminosity of @xmath149  erg .",
    "the latest dim afterglow sample , compiled by @xcite , has a mean value of @xmath150 .",
    "with grb 060912a , we have added another case to a few puzzling grbs that show achromatic x - ray lc breaks at the beginning and end of a plateau phase which are not present in the optical band . unlike the original sample compiled by @xcite and those supplemented by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in current case the optical temporal index is quite similar to the contemporaneous x - ray one before and after the x - ray plateau .",
    "although the optical and x - ray characteristics during the x - ray plateau are difficult to explain self - consistently just as the others , the standard afterglow model can actually apply to the rest stages of this grb .",
    "the optical afterglow showed little if any evolution in its temporal index and optical colors , so it likely arose from the same synchrotron spectral segment throughout , or specifically @xmath151 of the ism and slow - cooling case , while the post - plateau x - ray afterglow must have @xmath152 as demonstrated by its slightly steeper lc slope and a significant spectral deviation from the optical - to - x - ray sed .",
    "there could be a cooling break around the beginning of the x - ray plateau , but we do not have the early x - ray spectrum to either argue for or against this . in overall",
    "our data analysis seems to support a hypothesis that the optical and x - ray afterglows are of the same origin except for the x - ray plateau which is dominated by an extra component @xcite .",
    "other explanations like a reverse - shock afterglow @xcite and the `` late prompt '' emission @xcite are not favored for this grb .",
    "an evolution of microphysical parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) is not excluded providing that it is strictly associated with the energy injection process . a quantitative comparison between our data and the theory of @xcite may be possible but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have shown evidence of a 2175-  extinction feature in the optical sed of the grb 060912a afterglow .",
    "such a feature has only been observed in a very small number of grbs , which may also include grb  970508 @xcite , grb  991216 @xcite , grb  050802 @xcite , grb  070802 @xcite , grb  080607 @xcite , and possibly even the high - redshift grb  050904 @xcite . only the identification in grb  070802 can be regarded as robust since the feature was detected not only through multi - color photometry but also clearly in a spectrum . in the other cases ,",
    "the feature was merely revealed as a dip in the corresponding passband in the observed optical sed .",
    "although the afterglow spectrum of grb  991216 also displayed a similar feature , it centers at a somewhat `` wrong '' position , about 2360  , @xcite .",
    "this uv absorption bump is the most prominent feature of the mw extinction law and is now widely hypothesized to be caused by a mixture of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules or clusters , whose strong c - c bond @xmath153 transitions peak at @xmath154   , and small carbon - rich grains ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both species are thought to be fragile under the illumination of strong uv and x - ray radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so the reported absorption likely took place a few parsecs away from the grb location ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested that the uv bump requires a relatively evolved stellar population , which means less dust / molecule destruction by uv photons or interstellar shocks , in order to explain its absence in the smc and most starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "so it is not surprising that the majority of grb afterglow seds are best fitted using a smc extinction law ( e.g. , @xcite ) since they are typically hosted in faint dwarf star - forming galaxies . on the other hand , among the few cases with a reported uv bump , grb  050802 , grb  060912a , and grb",
    "070802 all have a host galaxy unusually bright ( possibly @xmath155 ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and this paper ) for a grb , while the faint host galaxy of grb  970508 has an early - type morphology @xcite .",
    "finally we note that when the paper is written a statistical study made by @xcite is published which also presents the uvot sed of grb 060912a , but those authors seem prudent not to claim the observed @xmath1-band flux depression a detection of the 2175-  feature .",

    "<S> we present optical photometry of the grb 060912a afterglow obtained with ground - based telescopes , from about 100  sec after the grb trigger till about 0.3  day later , supplemented with the @xmath0 optical afterglow data released in its official website . </S>",
    "<S> the optical light curve ( lc ) displays a smooth single power - law decay throughout the observed epochs , with a power - law index of about -1 and no significant color evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the x - ray lc which has a plateau phase between two normal power - law decays of a respective index of about -1 and -1.2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown by our combined x - ray and optical data analysis that this asynchronous behavior is difficult to be reconciled with the standard afterglow theory and energy injection hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct an optical - to - x - ray spectral energy distribution at about 700  sec after the grb trigger . </S>",
    "<S> it displays a significant flux depression in the @xmath1-band , reminding us of the possibility of a host - galaxy ( at @xmath2 ) 2175-  dust absorption similar to the one that characterizes the milky way extinction law . </S>",
    "<S> such an identification , although being tentative , may be confirmed by our detailed analysis using both template extinction laws and the afterglow theory . so far the feature is reported in very few grb afterglows . </S>",
    "<S> most seem to have a host galaxy either unusually bright for a grb , just like this one , or of an early type , supporting the general suggestion of an anti - correlation between the feature and star - forming activities . </S>"
