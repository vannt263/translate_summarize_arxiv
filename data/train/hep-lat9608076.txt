    "canonical , or fixed area , partition function is defined as the sum over all possible ways of gluing @xmath2 equilateral triangles together to form a piecewise linear manifold ( with an appropriate topology ) : @xmath3 in the case of matter coupled to gravity , the triangulations @xmath4 are weighted with the partition function @xmath5 for the corresponding matter fields .    in eq .",
    "( [ * 11 ] ) @xmath6 represents the class of triangulations ( of area @xmath2 ) included in the partition function .",
    "different classes correspond to different discretization of the manifolds .",
    "two commonly used classes are : _ combinatorial _ triangulations @xmath7 , and _ degenerate _ triangulations @xmath8 . in the former a vertex is not allowed to connected to itself , nor can any two vertices be connected by more than one link  this excludes tadpole and self - energy diagrams in the dual graph .",
    "this restriction is eased for degenerate triangulations .",
    "clearly @xmath9 . in cases",
    "where the model eq .",
    "( [ * 11 ] ) has been solved , it has been shown that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are in the same universality class @xcite .",
    "but how general is this universality , i.e.  how much restriction can be imposed on the triangulations before the critical behavior of the model changes  clearly including only one triangulation would produce different result . in the work presented here",
    ", we investigate this by considering a new class of triangulations @xmath12 , the class of _ minimal triangulations _ , in which only vertices with coordination number 5 , 6 , and 7 are allowed .",
    "this is as far as we can go in suppressing curvature fluctuations , while still retaining the fluid nature of the surfaces .",
    "we will demonstrate , by studying the critical behavior of pure gravity and an ising matter coupled to gravity , that this restriction does not change the critical behavior of the model .",
    "an additional motivation for studying this class of triangulations is that they more closely resemble conventional condensed matter systems .",
    "previously studied models of dynamical triangulations allow vertices with arbitrary high curvature , whereas a real system places a cut - off on the number of interaction for a single particle .",
    "that minimal dynamical triangulations are in the usual universality class of @xmath13 gravity , implies that the kpz - exponents might be realized in a real system ( yet to be discovered ) .",
    "we start by investigating this model in the absence of matter ( @xmath14 ) . to determine the critical behavior we study the fractal structure of the surfaces .",
    "more precisely we measure the string susceptibility exponent @xmath15 , which governs the critical behavior of the grand canonical partition function @xmath16 . in numerical simulations , @xmath15 is obtained from the size distribution of minimal neck baby universes @xmath17 @xcite ; @xmath18^{\\gamma_s-2}.\\ ] ] for pure gravity @xmath19 .",
    "we have measured the distribution @xmath17 for minimal triangulations , this is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( curve @xmath20 ) . for comparison",
    "we also show the corresponding distribution measured on combinatorial triangulations ( curve @xmath21 ) .",
    "in addition fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] includes a distribution measured on triangulations obtained from minimal triangulations via node decimation .",
    "we will discuss this later .",
    "although , for large baby universes , the slope of the distributions @xmath20 and @xmath21 is similar , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] clearly shows much bigger finite size effects for minimal triangulations .",
    "this is easily understood , as the restrictions on minimal triangulations effectively smoothens the surfaces locally  in fact there is a lower cut - off on the size of the baby universes .",
    "an estimate of @xmath15 for the minimal triangulations yields @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , compared to @xmath26 for combinatorial triangulations and the exact value @xmath27 .",
    "the same result is also obtained by using a recently proposed real - space rg method for dynamical triangulations ; _ node decimation _ @xcite . applying node decimation",
    "we have blocked the minimal triangulations repeatedly , down to 250 nodes , using a blocking factor of 2 .",
    "note that under blocking , the minimal triangulations flow into the wider class of combinatorial triangulations .",
    "we then measure the distribution @xmath17 on the ensemble of blocked triangulations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "clearly the distribution obtained from minimal triangulations via blocking is much closer to the distribution for combinatorial triangulations than the original  this implies that the finite size effects are reduced in the blocking .",
    "this also implies that under blocking the model flows towards a non - trivial fixed point , corresponding to @xmath13 gravity .",
    "the reductions of finite size effects is also apparent in the value of @xmath15 , measured on the blocked triangulations .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab1 ] . under blocking the measured value of @xmath15",
    "approaches the exact value .",
    ".measured values of @xmath15 for minimal dynamical triangulations ( without matter ) after applying varying levels of node decimation with a blocking factor of @xmath28 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "we have also investigated the critical behavior of an ising model coupled to minimal triangulations , for lattice sizes @xmath29 to 8000 . in this case @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an ising spin placed on vertex @xmath32 .",
    "the ising spins were updated using a swendsen - wang cluster algorithm and approximately @xmath33 sweeps performed per data - point .",
    "we must first determine the infinite volume critical coupling @xmath34 .",
    "this is done by locating the peaks in the specific heat @xmath35 and the derivate of binders cumulant @xmath36 ; both are expected to approach @xmath34 as @xmath37  the height of @xmath36 scales like @xmath38 .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath39 for the ising model coupled to minimal dynamical triangulations .    using this estimate of @xmath34 , we then determine other critical exponents using finite size scaling .",
    "we have the magnetization ; @xmath40 , the magnetic susceptibility ; @xmath41 , and the specific heat ; @xmath42 .",
    "the exponents are shown in table  2 together with the kpz and onsager predictions .",
    "we indicate the finite size effects by imposing different lower cut - off s on the lattice size used .",
    "but the conclusion is clear  the measured exponents agree very well with the kpz - exponents .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the critical behavior of a so - called minimal dynamical triangulation model of @xmath13 gravity . in this model",
    "only vertices of coordination numbers 5 , 6 , and 7 are allowed  this effectively suppresses the high curvature fluctuations . by studying the fractal structure of pure gravity , and the critical properties of an ising model coupled to gravity ,",
    "we conclude that the critical behavior is not affected by this restriction to minimal triangulations  the model is in the same universality class as with combinatorial or degenerate triangulations .",
    "this implies that large curvature fluctuations do not play an important role in determining the continuum structure of @xmath13 quantum gravity .",
    "this result agrees with recent studies of a matrix - model formulation of @xmath43-gravity , where similarly the @xmath43-term can be used suppress the curvature fluctuations locally . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the @xmath43 operator is irrelevant in the continuum limit  at large length scales the model always reduces to that of pure gravity ."
