    "the homeomorphism type of a compact , closed , simply connected symplectic 4-manifold is uniquely determined by its euler characteristic @xmath3 , signature @xmath4 , and the intersection form @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is indefinite , as it happens in most of the cases , it is determined by @xmath3,@xmath4 and its _",
    "parity_. it is natural to ask for which combinations ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 ) there exists such symplectic manifold , and how many distinct representatives there are .",
    "the first question is called the _ geography problem _ , the second is referred to as the _ botany_.",
    "both have been previously studied in the context of complex surfaces .",
    "symplectic 4-manifolds can be equipped with an almost complex structure , and this provides the possibility to use some notions coming from the complex geometry . in particular , we can define chern classes and chern numbers .",
    "chern classes , in general , depend on the choice of an almost complex structure , but @xmath7 is the same as euler characteristic @xmath3 , and @xmath8 , which in the complex case denotes the self - intersection of a canonical divisor , can be extended uniquely by hirzebruch signature formula @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , we can define the holomorphic euler characteristic @xmath10 by setting @xmath11 .",
    "the existence of the almost complex structure guarantees this number to be an integer .",
    "the convention in 4-manifold geography is to use pairs ( @xmath10 , @xmath8 ) instead of ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and we will follow it in this article .",
    "important fact about chern numbers is the bogomolov ",
    "miyaoka  yau inequality , asserting that @xmath12 holds for complex surfaces of general type .",
    "it was conjectured by by fintushel and stern that this relation holds also for symplectic 4-manifolds .",
    "most recent attempts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in exploring the geography problem for simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds of positive signature , or equivalently those with @xmath13 , provided families of examples close to the bogomolov  miyaoka  yau line ( b  m  y line ) .",
    "these constructions followed similar pattern  started with a complex surface with nontrivial fundamental group lying on , or close to the b ",
    "m  y line , and performed an operation which preserved symplectic structure and reduced the topological complexity of the original surface .",
    "the operation in use was either symplectic connected normal sum used several times , fibered knot surgery or logarithmic transformation in a cusp neighborhood .",
    "the botany question for complex surfaces has a partial answer  the number of non - diffeomorphic complex surfaces of general type in a given homeomorphism type is always finite , although there is no uniform bound on this number .",
    "the other large family , elliptic surfaces , is also well understood ( see @xcite for further references ) .",
    "however , for simply connected elliptic surfaces in a given homeomorphism type there are infinitely many different smooth structures .",
    "these two results reflects the nature of restrictions given by the complex ( geometric ) structure .    in symplectic case ,",
    "the picture is less clear due to the availability of many gluing constructions , which are topological in nature .",
    "fintushel and stern in @xcite provided another infinite family of symplectic 4-manifolds with different seiberg ",
    "witten ( @xmath14 ) invariants , all of them homeomorphic to the standard @xmath15 surface @xmath16 .",
    "the method , fibered knot surgery , is different from the logarithmic transformation , and can be used with similar success for any symplectic 4-manifold containing cusp fiber and satisfying some additional properties ( e.g. existence of a @xmath17-embedded torus fiber ) . in particular",
    ", it can be used also for symplectic manifolds coming from ( some ) complex surfaces of general type .",
    "this indicates that the botany problem for symplectic 4-manifolds comprises infinitely many diffeomorphism types for a much larger class of homeomorphism types labeled by triples ( @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 ) .    in the following",
    "we will construct a family @xmath18 of simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds close to the b  m ",
    "moreover , for each @xmath18 there exist infinitely many mutually non - diffeomorphic symplectic 4-manifolds , all homeomorphic to @xmath18 .",

    "in @xcite , hirzebruch gave an example of a sequence @xmath23 of minimal complex surfaces of general type with the following chern numbers    @xmath24 @xmath25    we briefly recall his construction , and also discuss some topological properties of smooth models of these algebraic surfaces .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the elliptic curve    @xmath28    let @xmath29 be a complex surface , and denote its points by @xmath30 .",
    "there is a well defined complex multiplication by algebraic integers @xmath31 $ ] on @xmath27 .",
    "the elliptic curve in @xmath32 given by @xmath33 is then isomorphic to @xmath27 for every algebraic integer @xmath34 . consider the following curves on @xmath29    @xmath35    all four curves pass through the origin and do not intersect each other anywhere else .",
    "it is , in fact , the consequence of the special choice of @xmath36 as a generator of the elliptic curve @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath37 is also a unit in @xmath38 $ ] and the curves @xmath39 , @xmath40 do not intersect outside of the origin . other cases are trivial .",
    "let @xmath41 be the lattice in @xmath29 consisting of @xmath42 points    @xmath43    for each point of @xmath41 there are four curves passing through it , parallel to the curves @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . denote the union of @xmath46 curves parallel to @xmath47 as @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "altogether we have @xmath50 elliptic curves forming four parallel families . except for the points in @xmath41",
    "there are no other intersection points . after blowing up @xmath42 points of @xmath41",

    "denote by @xmath54 the proper transforms of @xmath48 after the blow - up ; these curves are smooth and do not intersect each other .",

    "denote this covering map as @xmath60 .",
    "then a calculation of euler characteristic gives    @xmath61    for the chern number @xmath8 we have    @xmath62    for the actual computation , and for the further details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the map @xmath60 can be extended via the natural projections to the factors of the torus @xmath29 .",
    "then we have the following diagram :    @xmath63    the map @xmath64 respects the natural fibration of @xmath29 , singular fibers occur over the @xmath46 points in the set @xmath65 , and are formed by the curve @xmath66 and exceptional curves @xmath52 . the situation for the map @xmath67 is analogous .    composed maps @xmath68 , @xmath69 give two different ( singular ) fibrations of space @xmath23 over a 2-dimensional torus .",
    "in fact , these maps are holomorphic outside the blown - up points and corresponding exceptional curves , which leads us to the observation that a generic fiber of @xmath68 is a smooth holomorphic curve .    for a regular point @xmath70 in @xmath44 , i.e. point not belonging to @xmath71 , the inverse image",
    "@xmath72 is an elliptic curve parallel to @xmath45 .",
    "this fiber is intersected @xmath73 times by the curves @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "note , that these points are branching points of the map @xmath76 restricted to the map of two  dimensional fibers in @xmath23 and @xmath58 over the point @xmath70 . by the following computation of euler characteristic of a regular fiber @xmath77",
    "we get @xmath78    hence the genus of a regular fiber is @xmath79 .    for the singular value @xmath80 of the composed map @xmath68 and the respective singular fiber @xmath81 the situation is a bit more complicated .",
    "we know that @xmath80 belongs to @xmath71 , and since the construction is completely symmetric with respect to the points in @xmath71 , it is enough to describe the singular fiber over one point",
    ". we can choose the point @xmath82 . then the inverse image @xmath83 consists of @xmath46 exceptional spheres @xmath52 corresponding to the blown up points over @xmath80 , connected with and intersected by the proper transform @xmath84 of the torus @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , each of the exceptional spheres is intersected at exactly 3 different points by @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "this gives us the complete information about the map @xmath87 .",
    "the singular fiber @xmath88 consists of @xmath46 tori  copies of @xmath84 , connected with @xmath46 copies of branched covers @xmath89 of exceptional spheres @xmath52 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the euler characteristic of @xmath89 is    @xmath91    and the euler characteristic of the whole fiber @xmath88 is    @xmath92    to summarize the above mentioned facts we state the lemma .",
    "[ tor1 ] there exists a complex surface @xmath23 of general type with chern numbers @xmath93 , @xmath94 , holomorphic euler characteristic @xmath95 , signature @xmath96 , and is equipped with a map @xmath97 .",
    "the genus of a regular fiber @xmath98 is @xmath99 .",
    "in this section we describe the topology of @xmath23 via the study of its fundamental group .",
    "since our ultimate goal is to construct simply connected 4-manifold obtained from @xmath23 by a certain gluing , it would be convenient to find an embedded surface with small genus which generates as much of the fundamental group of @xmath23 as possible .",
    "we use the fact that the maps @xmath68 , @xmath69 map the space @xmath23 to tori @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    denote by @xmath100 a regular fiber over some regular point @xmath101 , and",
    "@xmath102 a regular fiber over some regular point @xmath103 . recall that the resulting surfaces @xmath104 , @xmath105 are smooth complex curves . in the previous section we computed the genera of these curves , they are the same , and equal @xmath106 .    the number of intersection points between @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be deduced from the following observation .",
    "surface @xmath105 projects down by the map @xmath76 to an embedded torus in @xmath58 .",
    "the map @xmath76 restricted to @xmath105 is then an @xmath57-fold branched cover . when we project resulting torus further down by the map @xmath64 into @xmath44 we get , actually , one - to - one map .",
    "therefore the restricted map @xmath107 is an @xmath57-fold branched cover as well . as a consequence",
    "we get that the number of intersection points between @xmath104 and @xmath105 is exactly @xmath57 .",
    "note that all intersections are transversal and positive .",

    "we can assume that the base point @xmath111 of the fundamental group @xmath112 is one of intersection points of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the map @xmath68 is singular over points in the set @xmath71 .",
    "since the singular locus @xmath113 in @xmath23 has dimension 2 , by using standard transversality argument we can assume that the representative of @xmath114 avoids singularities .",
    "consider the projection @xmath115 .",
    "this gives a loop inside @xmath44 avoiding singular points in @xmath71 .",
    "the inverse image of @xmath116 , the space @xmath117 is therefore a surface bundle over @xmath116 , and the fiber of this bundle over the point @xmath111 is exactly @xmath104 . using the fact that @xmath105 is a branched cover of @xmath44",
    ", we can deduce that the intersection of the bundle and the surface @xmath105 is an @xmath57-fold cover of the loop @xmath116 , in particular @xmath105 intersects each fiber in @xmath57 points .",
    "since the loop @xmath114 lies inside the bundle whose fiber is connected , we can homotopically deform @xmath114 into @xmath118 which will lie inside @xmath105 except for the part lying above the point @xmath111 and in the fiber @xmath104 .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "[ tor3 ] there exists an embedded symplectic surface @xmath119 in @xmath23 such that the inclusion map @xmath120 is surjective .",

    "we obtain @xmath119 from @xmath108 by standard resolution of singular intersection points in @xmath123 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath104 , @xmath105 are regular fibers , each of them have zero self - intersection number .",
    "the resolution of each positive intersection point increases the self - intersection by 2 , hence @xmath125 ^ 2 = ( [ f_1 ] + [ f_2])^2 = 2[f_1][f_2 ] = 2 n^3 $ ] .",
    "finally , the resolution of a singular point is only a local operation , but it might , and in fact does , change the fundamental group of respective surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , the map @xmath126 is surjective , its kernel being generated by loops in @xmath119 which can be contracted to singular points in @xmath108 .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "surfaces @xmath104 and @xmath105 from the last section were non - degenerate holomorphic curves . after the resolution of their intersection points we got a smooth embedded surface @xmath119 , which is embedded symplectically .",
    "we will perform connected symplectic sum operation ( as defined by gompf in @xcite ) to the ( symplectic ) manifold @xmath23 along embedded symplectic surface @xmath119 to obtain simply connected symplectic 4-manifold @xmath18 .",
    "the ingredient we still need to provide is the second summand  a simply connected symplectic manifold @xmath127 , preferably with small chern numbers @xmath8 and @xmath7 , and with embedded symplectic surface of same genus and opposite self - intersection as @xmath119 .",
    "we begin with a @xmath15 surface @xmath16 , equipped with the standard elliptic fibration @xmath128 . in order to obtain a non - degenerate holomorphic curve ( or symplectic surface ) of relatively large negative self - intersection , we need to select a number of points on a curve , and blow them up . resulting proper transform of the original curve",
    "will have the required negative self - intersection , decreasing by 1 after each blow - up .",
    "the adjunction formula for complex and symplectic manifolds implies that this is basically the only effective procedure how to obtain such surfaces .",

    "note that the elliptic fibration remained untouched outside blown - up points .",
    "now we can perform fibered knot surgery ( see @xcite ) , in a small tubular neighborhood of a regular elliptic fiber @xmath27 in a neighborhood of one of the cusp fibers in @xmath16 .",
