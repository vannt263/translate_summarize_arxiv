    "<S> , @xmath158 decreases for @xmath172 as observed by neutron measurements . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath159 increases as @xmath172 with satisfying the relation @xmath173 , which is widely observed in y- , bi- and hg - based compounds @xcite . also , the relation @xmath174 is consistently with experiments .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we explain why the cdw appears only in slightly under - doped region . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ( b ) , we show the inverse of @xmath29 at the cdw boundary , @xmath175 , for @xmath40 , by adjusting @xmath27 to satisfy @xmath176 . in the case of ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath177 , @xmath161 decreases as @xmath172 , since the al - vc at @xmath2 , which is proportional to @xmath178 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( f ) , becomes small when @xmath179 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath65 decreases with @xmath162 in cuprates , which is reproduced by the flex approximation using a fixed @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the cdw should disappear in over - doped region since the al - vc is scaled by @xmath180 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we also set @xmath181 as ( ii ) @xmath182 and ( iii ) @xmath183 . in case ( iii ) , if we fix @xmath184 ( dotted line ) , the cdw is realized only for @xmath185 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the phase diagram in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ( c ) is well understood .    in la - based compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath186 is satisfied @xcite , differently from other compounds . to understand this fact in the present theory , we study the case @xmath187 , in which @xmath188 at @xmath189 reaches @xmath190 ev@xmath38 , which is still smaller than the neutron experimental data in 60k ybco @xcite . in this case , the incommensurate peak in @xmath97 becomes sharper as observed in la - based compounds . </S>",
    "<S> then , the shoulder peak in @xmath44 at @xmath191 becomes prominent as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the cdw wavevector @xmath159 is fixed at @xmath95 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] ( b ) . in this case , @xmath192 ev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the relation @xmath186 can be realized when @xmath97 shows clear incommensurate peak structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the present cdw mechanism due to al - vc can explain both the relations @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and the latter is realized when @xmath97 shows clear incommensurate peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this result would be a great hint to understand the cdw in lsco . </S>",
    "<S> note that the relation @xmath195 is naturally understood since the al - vc represents the interference of two magnons .     for @xmath26 and ( b ) @xmath158 and @xmath159 in the case of @xmath187 ( @xmath196 ev ) and @xmath197ev . </S>",
    "<S> ]    in our theory , the cdw originates from the repulsive interactions , and the @xmath198-ph interaction is unnecessary . in real compounds , the coulomb - interaction - driven cdw fluctuations couple to the lattice due to finite @xmath198-ph interactions </S>",
    "<S> , so the kohn anomaly will emerge . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the close relation between the cdw in cuprates and the nematic orbital order in fe - pnictides . in both systems </S>",
    "<S> , the charge - spin interference , which is given in the al - vc , causes the inter - orbital charge transfer when @xmath199 @xcite . in fe - pnictides , both @xmath157 and @xmath200 @xmath0-orbital orders </S>",
    "<S> / fluctuations have been discussed intensively @xcite , and both fluctuations will contribute to the superconductivity .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we revealed that the axial nematic cdw in under - doped cuprates originates from the al - vcs in @xmath201 , which describes the interference of two - magnons . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that both the spin fluctuations at @xmath202 and charge - orbital fluctuations at @xmath203 develop mutually . </S>",
    "<S> ( this vc - driven cdw can not emerge in the single - orbital hubbard model , as we discuss in supplemental material @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> we predict that charge - orbital - spin multimode fluctuations emerge ubiquitously in cuprates , fe - pnictides , and other strongly correlated electron systems , due to the significant contribution of the al - vc .    </S>",
