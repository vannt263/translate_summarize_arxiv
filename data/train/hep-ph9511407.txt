    "this explains the above finding that the fac scale changes significantly for large values of @xmath3 when passing from the one - loop to the two - loop order .",

    ", a value more realistic for @xmath299-scattering at future colliders , we find the critical mass value to be @xmath300 gev .",
    "for such values of @xmath3 and @xmath11 the high - energy approximation yields about 70% of the exact @xmath4-dependence of the cross section  @xcite . increasing @xmath11 , the breakdown of perturbation theory as seen in the scheme - dependence criterion happens for smaller and smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "we will come back to this later .",
    "in addition to the scheme dependence , we also evaluate the scale - dependence criterion .",
    "since the renormalization group is used to resum @xmath301 terms , the scale @xmath15 is varied around @xmath11 rather than @xmath3 .",
    "the arguments of sect .",
    "[ sect : scheme ] , which are based on the size of the beta function coefficients , suggest the range @xmath302 . choosing @xmath303 gev",
    ", the result of this variation is shown in fig .",
    "[ wwzzrge ] for both @xmath211 and oms scheme . in the @xmath211 scheme",
    ", we observe a nice order - by - order reduction of the scale dependence if @xmath3 is less than 357 gev . for larger values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the nll scale dependence exceeds the ll one , and for @xmath304 gev we also find the nnll scale dependence to be larger than the nll one . for the oms",
    "result we find only one crossing point .",
    "there the nnll scale dependence dominates over the nll one if @xmath305 gev .",
    "taking also the scheme dependence into account we conclude that perturbative results for longitudinal gauge boson scattering at @xmath303 gev cease to be meaningful if @xmath3 is of the order 400 gev or above . for a value of @xmath306 gev",
    "we find limits of @xmath307 , but here the additional low - energy contributions  though not dominant  may change the limit .",
    "the upper bounds on a perturbative higgs mass from scattering processes are more stringent than the results found in higgs decays .",
    "the reasons are two - fold .",
    "first , the one - loop and two - loop coefficients of the perturbative corrections to the cross section are an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding coefficients of the decay processes .",
    "second , the running coupling evaluated at a scale @xmath308 is numerically larger than the coupling involved in the decay widths .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the bounds derived here are similar to the results found in @xcite which are based on perturbative violation of unitarity at two loops , a rather different criterion for the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "compared to the nonperturbative lattice results of @xmath309 gev @xcite , our perturbative criteria require smaller higgs masses .      in fig .",
    "[ wwzzembed ] we show the upper bound for a perturbative higgs mass as a function of some embedding scale @xmath310 . since the standard model higgs sector is  depending on the value of @xmath3  not defined above a certain energy scale , it is a common procedure to introduce an embedding scale above which the physical interactions are to be described by a more complete theory . requiring that the sm higgs sector is still perturbative at such an embedding scale",
    ", it is possible to give upper bounds on the higgs mass as a function of the embedding scale .",
    "here we require the process @xmath311 to be perturbative for energies @xmath312 and apply our criteria for scheme and scale dependence to calculate the upper bound on @xmath3 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ wwzzembed ] . at 2 tev ,",
    "the different bounds on @xmath3 correspond to the values derived from figs .",
    "[ wwzzfigscheme ] and [ wwzzrge ] . for increasing embedding scale , the upper bound on @xmath3 decreases , and the three different criteria give converging bounds . at @xmath313 gev ,",
    "the upper bound is @xmath314 gev . for such low higgs masses",
    ", however , one expects the top - quark yukawa coupling to have an influence on the rg evolution of the higgs coupling . as a matter of fact",
    ", the sm beta function of the higgs coupling can become negative if the higgs particle is too light , invalidating our analysis .",
    "taking @xmath315 gev , this is expected to happen for @xmath316 gev @xcite , which is lower than the values considered by us . using the results of lindner  @xcite",
    ", we expect the change of our higgs mass bounds due to a top - quark mass of 175 gev to be less than 10% for the whole range of energy - scales considered . for comparison",
    ", we also display the values of @xmath3 which would lead to a one - loop landau singularity at @xmath317 . calculating the landau pole",
    ", we again neglected yukawa and gauge couplings .",
    "it is worth noting that our criteria for an upper higgs mass lead to values of the running coupling at the embedding scale which are not very large . for values of @xmath11 in the tev range ,",
    "the maximal allowed value of the running coupling is less than 2.2 , and at gut energies we find the maximal value to be less than 1.6 .",
    "these small values are surprising : the beta function and the solutions for the running coupling show excellent convergence for such small values . as a matter of fact",
    ", the usual criteria for the breakdown of perturbation theory assume that the running coupling becomes large . yet",
    "this method is unsatisfactory : the consideration of the one - loop landau pole as in @xcite can not be extended to higher orders .",
    "instead the authors of @xcite use the criterion of ( in our notation ) @xmath318 . here",
    "the choice of the numerical bound involves some arbitrariness .",
    "the plots in fig .",
    "[ rgecurves ] and fig .",
    "[ rgecurves3lp ] show that @xmath319 is clearly chosen too large , because the different solutions differ substantially for @xmath320 .",
    "the second arbitrariness of this methods resides in the fact that the breakdown of perturbation theory is judged from a scheme dependent quantity : @xmath321 depends on the renormalization scheme through the radiative corrections to the matching condition ( [ defloms ] ) and , most important , through the coefficients @xmath104 , @xmath322 , of the @xmath2-function . in contrast",
    "physical observables are scheme independent up to the calculated order .",
    "they , however , seem to become non - perturbative for much smaller values of @xmath4 . for comparison , the unitarity arguments used in @xcite yield an upper bound on the running coupling of 2.3 , independent of any choice of @xmath11 .",
    "= 4.0 in    = 3.0 in = 3.0 in    = 3.0 in",
    "our analysis of various physical processes of the higgs sector indicates that the breakdown of perturbation theory can not be judged purely on grounds of a large higgs ( running ) coupling .",
    "the breakdown of perturbation theory in both higgs decays ( @xmath323 ) and scattering processes ( @xmath324 ) occurs for relatively small values of the higgs coupling .",
    "the usual criterion  the breakdown of the perturbative behaviour of the beta function and the running coupling  yields upper bounds for a perturbative higgs mass which are too large .    applying our criteria of scheme - dependence and scale - dependence to higgs decays , we find a satisfactory perturbative behaviour of the decay widths if @xmath325 o(700 gev ) . in the case of @xmath285 scattering processes , one needs to specify the energy scale at which the process is to take place .",
    "choosing @xmath11 to be a couple of tev , the higgs mass has to be less than o(400 gev ) to guarantee a good perturbative behaviour of the cross section for @xmath291 scattering .",
    "requiring such processes to be perturbative at @xmath326 gev , the higgs mass has to be less than o(150 gev ) .",
