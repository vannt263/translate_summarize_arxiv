    "one of the main goals of the long - standing quest for a better understanding of the supernova ( sn ) explosion mechanism is the establishment of a theoretical connection between the properties of progenitor stars and those of sne and their remnants .",
    "understanding the progenitor - remnant systematics would not only mean a better definition of sne as the end point of massive - star evolution , it could also serve as input for continuative theoretical studies like binary population synthesis calculations .",
    "moreover , it would provide indispensable information and the theoretical basis for deducing constraints from observations on the physical processes that trigger and power the onset of the explosion at the center of the sn .",
    "in particular , the explosion mechanism plays a crucial role for determining the energetic and dynamical properties of the sn blast wave .",
    "it thus controls the conditions for explosive nucleosynthesis and is of central importance for answering long - standing astrophysical questions : which progenitors give birth to neutron stars ( nss ) , which ones to black holes ( bhs ) ? how do sn properties depend on the progenitor metallicity ?",
    "are the observed masses of compact remnants compatible with modeling results ?",
    "do observed sne provide evidence for more than one explosion mechanism ?",
    "in particular , considering neutrino heating as the most widely favored process to trigger the explosions @xcite , the specific question arises , which range of sn energies and nickel masses can be explained by the neutrino - driven mechanism .    a popular way to model the blast wave initiation for studying sn nucleosynthesis and determining compact remnant masses are piston - driven explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , in which a piston is placed at a chosen position in the pre- or post - collapse stellar core and moved with a prescribed , time - dependent velocity to mimic the infall of the selected mass shell and the explosive expansion of the newly formed sn shock . besides the initial mass cut fallback of nonescaping material may shift the final mass cut also the energy deposited by the piston is prescribed as a free parameter .",
    "alternatively , internal energy `` bombs '' have been used , in which a defined amount of thermal energy is released by an artificial increase of the temperature in a certain volume @xcite .    investigating spherically symmetric stellar core collapse by hydrodynamic simulations with simplified neutrino treatment ,",
    "@xcite identified a single parameter , the `` progenitor bounce compactness '' @xmath5 of the innermost 2.5@xmath0 of a star , whose value above a certain threshold they considered to be indicative for an unlikely explosion and thus bh formation .",
    "progenitors with @xmath6 were found to reach the bh formation limit typically within @xmath70.8s after bounce because of their tremendous mass accretion rates .",
    "such stars also turned out to require a particularly high time - averaged neutrino - heating efficiency to develop an explosion against the huge ram pressure of the infalling core material .",
    "nevertheless , the exact value of @xmath5 where the bifurcation of the behavior occurs , appears somewhat arbitrarily chosen and not supported by strong theoretical arguments . in particular , the bh formation limit could already take place at a lower value of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite made theoretical predictions of the ns / bh mass distribution by applying a simple analytic concept for estimating the explosion time , explosion energy , and fallback mass on the basis of structural properties of the progenitor stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived theoretical bh mass distributions by employing the explosion energy as function of the progenitor mass from a fit to results of a small set of four 2d models of neutrino - driven explosions @xcite .",
    "they considered different fallback masses in dependence on the ( parametized ) fraction of the energy released by the sn mechanism that is used to unbind the outer layers of the progenitor stars .    in this work",
    "we adopt a different approach .",
    "we perform hydrodynamical simulations in spherical symmetry for a large set of 101 progenitor models , following core collapse and bounce , postbounce accretion , the possible onset of an explosion and subsequent neutrino - driven wind phase of the cooling proto - neutron star ( pns ) , and the development of the sn blast wave over hours to days until the fallback mass is determined . in order to power the explosions , we refer to the neutrino - driven mechanism , whose viability seems to be supported by recent 2d simulations with detailed energy - dependent neutrino transport @xcite and general relativity @xcite , although an ultimate robustness of the model predictions may require 3d simulations and may hinge on remaining uncertainties of the high - density neutrino opacities and equation of state ( eos ) . since in our spherical simulations explosions by neutrino heating must be triggered artificially , we excise the high - density core of the nascent ns and replace it by a time - dependent , analytic cooling model .",
    "this core model yields the time evolution of the neutrino emission from the high - density interior of the pns .",
    "its free parameters are adjusted such that observational characteristics of sn  1987a , i.e. , the explosion energy , @xmath8erg , and ejected @xmath9ni mass , @xmath10 , are reproduced for progenitor stars around 20@xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies the assumption that sn  1987a was an ordinary case of a neutrino - driven explosion in which , e.g. , exceptionally rapid core rotation did not play a crucial role for the collapse dynamics .",
    "the ns core model with the same parameter values is then also applied to all other collapsing stars .",
    "provided sn  1987a was such a normal case and neutrino - energy deposition was responsible for its explosion , our approach thus allows us to explore the response of other progenitor stars to the input of neutrino energy released from their forming compact remnants , and in the case of successful explosions to determine the blast wave and remnant properties of the stars . in the following",
    "we will give more information on our modeling strategy and tools , present our results , and discuss the implications .",
    "we employ the explicit , finite - volume , eulerian multi - fluid code prometheus @xcite to solve the 1d hydrodynamics equations on a spherical grid .",

    "the overall results are similar when neighboring stars or a sn  1987a blue supergiant progenitor @xcite are used for the calibration .",
    "the chosen parameter values lead to typical pns neutrino - cooling times ( @xmath102 for 90% of the total neutrino - energy release ) of 3.55.5s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pnscoolingtime ] ) .",
    "this is shorter than the @xmath110s of emission inferred from the sn  1987a neutrino events of kamiokande  ii .",
    "however , this detector reported a 7s gap after 8 events in the first two seconds , and the last 3 events were very close to the detection threshold @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the neutrino signal in all three experiments ( kamiokande  ii , irvine - michigan - brookhaven , and baksan ) is compatible with a pns cooling period ( exponential cooling timescale ) of only 45s @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our 1d simulations , which ignore postshock convection and yield standard values for the mean energies of radiated @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath1031017mev ) , naturally require overestimated postbounce neutrino fluxes to trigger explosions .",
    "since the neutrino emission of our pns model is roughly compatible with the sn  1987a data , we expect that our calibration by sn  1987a explosion properties reflects trends of neutrino - driven explosions whose validity for the investigated progenitors in relative comparison holds beyond the considered 1d setup .",
    "we also stress that our description of the core behavior accounts for the presence of an accretion layer surrounding the ( excised ) high - density core .",
    "the growth of this layer depends on the progenitor - specific stellar structure and corresponding mass - infall rate .",
    "its accretion luminosity , which adds to the analytically modeled core - neutrino luminosity , is also included in our simulations by means of a simple , grey transport approximation .",
    "the progenitor structure therefore influences the postbounce evolution in different ways .",
    "the density profile of the outer fe - core , si- , and o - layers does not only determine the mass accretion rate and thus the accretion luminosity ; it also governs the shock stagnation radius because high / low accretion rates damp / favor shock expansion .",
    "moreover , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nulum ] ) our pns - core model connects the neutrino emission of the pns core to the growth of the accretion mantle of the pns .",
    "core and accretion luminosity conspire in reviving and powering the shock wave , for which reason the neutrino emission properties of the pns ( core and accretion contributions ) are crucial for the explosion .",
    "it is therefore clear that the calibration of the pns - core parameters by the explosion properties of a chosen progenitor model can not be independent of the structure of this progenitor star .",
    "the fact that basic aspects of our results exhibit some robustness against variations of the calibration model is assuring .",
    "however , this does not imply that the predicted explosion properties could not change if the core structure of the sn  1987a progenitor was considerably different from the @xmath120@xmath104 solar metallicity stars and the blue supergiant model used in our calibration tests .",
    "metallicity effects , interaction in a binary scenario , or rotation and convective boundary effects could have affected the mass - loss history and thus could have altered the growth of the stellar core compared to the progenitors models considered by us for calibration .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is compatible with our results .",
    "this is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : remnantmassdistribution ] , which displays the normalized ( baryonic ) remnant mass distribution originating from our neutrino - driven explosion models , weighted by salpeter s @xcite stellar birth rate function ( with power - law index @xmath121 ) .",
    "we obtain a relatively wide distribution of ns masses ( see insert ) .",
    "note that these are birth masses resulting from single , nonrotating ( or at most slowly rotating ) stars , for which effects like mass transfer and mass loss associated with possible binary interaction during the progenitor evolution have been ignored .",
    "accretion of the nss in binaries will , of course , also modify this ns birth - mass distribution .",
    "the fallback mass that adds to the initial ns mass is shown in blue in the middle left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : snremnants ] .",
    "fallback is bigger ( up to @xmath10.2@xmath0 ) for the lower - mass progenitors where an extended hydrogen envelope leads to a significant deceleration of the explosion shock and a stronger reverse shock .",
    "the distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : remnantmassdistribution ] implies that 22.5% of the solar - metallicity progenitors produce bhs at the end of their lives .",
    "we point out that in the considered sample of 101 solar - metallicity progenitors only the 37@xmath0 star produces a fallback sn with delayed bh formation . in this case",
    "the black hole swallows a baryon mass of @xmath16.5@xmath0 while the explosion ejects the remaining @xmath13.2@xmath0 of the pre - collapse mass of the star .",
    "compared to the neighboring , exploding stars of 36@xmath0 and 38@xmath0 , the 37@xmath0 progenitor possesses a higher enclosed mass @xmath72 and higher gravitational binding energy @xmath122 in the central 15,000 km .",
    "this is reflected by its larger values of @xmath123 , @xmath108 , and @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : progenitorprops ] , although @xmath105 is slightly smaller . for this reason the 37@xmath0 model explodes only very late ( @xmath124s ) and with low explosion energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snremnants ] ) . because of the late onset of the blast - wave acceleration the neutrino energy injected to the explosion and the shock velocity become considerably lower than in the 36 and 38@xmath0 cases , in fact too low to unbind the major part of the star .",
    "it is interesting to note that the 39@xmath0 progenitor is even more extreme in all of its characteristic parameters displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : progenitorprops ] .",
    "correspondingly , it does not achieve to explode and collapses to a bh as a whole .",
    "in contrast , the 34@xmath0 model is also locally extreme in some of its structural parameters , but its compactness @xmath5 is lower and it explodes much earlier than the 37@xmath0 star .",
    "the latter therefore defines an intermediate , seemingly rare situation in which the combination of a high binding energy and core compactness of the star and a late onset of the explosion and low explosion energy favors the fallback of a large fraction of the progenitor mass .",
    "we performed simulations of neutrino - powered explosions in spherical symmetry for a large set of solar - metallicity , nonrotating stars with fe - cores .",
    "we calibrated an analytic neutrino - cooling model of the pns core such that the observed explosion properties of sn  1987a were reproduced for progenitors around 20@xmath0 .",
    "this yields numbers for the total energy release and cooling timescale of the newly formed ns in rough agreement with the sn  1987a neutrino measurement , thus confirming the overall consistency of our approach .    the neutrino - driven explosions turned out to be fostered by `` steps '' in the stellar density and entropy profiles , which reduce the mass - infall rate and ram pressure of the accretion flow and thus allow the shock to expand .",
    "explosions set in either by a continuous acceleration of the shock or after a phase of shock oscillations with growing amplitude .",
    "the onset times range from only 0.1s to more than 1s after core bounce , meaning that depending on the progenitor the explosion can occur relatively early or with a considerable delay .",
    "this conflicts with the claim that neutrino - driven explosions should generally be launched soon after bounce in order to account for the observed gap between highest ns masses and smallest bh masses @xcite .    reflecting the `` erratic '' structure differences of the progenitor models , the explosion properties and remnant masses exhibit highly nonmonotonic variability even in narrow ranges of the zams mass .",
    "this might explain the considerable differences of the explosion energies and nickel masses inferred for observed sne from lightcurve and spectral analyses as function of the zams mass of the progenitors without invoking additional pre - collapse degrees of freedom like rapid core rotation .",
    "however , the large variations of explosion and remnant properties even for small changes of the progenitor zams mass should be taken with caution .",
    "the mixing length or mixing length plus overshooting description of convection used in the employed progenitor models is extremely unstable to numerical effects in the late burning stages .",
    "while the trends we found in dependence of iron - core mass , core - binding energy , and compactness are likely to be valid , the large structural differences of progenitor models with similar zams masses probably do not reflect physical reality . instead , late stage convection is subject to substantial dynamic instability , for which reason there may be stochastic variations in the core properties at any given mass .",
    "an exploration of this possibility , however , has to be deferred until multi - dimensional progenitor models , self - consistently evolved to the onset of core collapse , become available .",
    "neutrino heating seems hardly able to provide explosion energies significantly higher than @xmath4erg and @xmath9ni yields in excess of 0.10.2@xmath0 .",
    "observed sne with higher explosion energies and nickel production ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are therefore likely to be driven by a mechanism that is different from neutrino heating and could involve magnetohydrodynamic processes .",
    "the distribution of ns birth masses ( including fallback ) spans from @xmath11.2@xmath0 to @xmath12.0@xmath0 in baryonic mass with a broad maximum between 1.4@xmath0 and 1.7@xmath0 .",
    "bh formation occurs in certain mass intervals and seems to be possible not only for progenitors with zams masses beyond 20@xmath0 but also between 15@xmath0 and 20@xmath0 . with a single exception ( the 37@xmath0 progenitor )",
    "all bhs swallow the progenitor completely .",
    "this suggests that fallback sne could be rare cases in solar - metallicity environments although roughly 23% of the progenitor population end as bhs . because of the large mass loss of stars with @xmath125@xmath0 , the fallback is strongest ( up to @xmath10.2@xmath0 ) for stars below @xmath120@xmath0 .",
    "correspondingly , we find a wide gap between the maximum ns birth mass ( around 1.8@xmath0 gravitational mass ) and the minimum bh mass ( roughly 6@xmath0 ) , compatible with conclusions from observed compact remnant masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should , however , be noted that our predictions do not account for binary effects prior and after the sn explosion , nor do we include nss formed from onemg - core progenitors .",
    "a direct comparison with observations therefore requires caution .",
    "the compactness parameter @xmath5 introduced by @xcite provides the best indicative quantity based on the pre - collapse structure for the final fate of a star , i.e. , whether it is likely to end as ns or bh .",
    "however , our models fail to explode significantly below the discriminating value of @xmath126 considered by @xcite .",
    "if this result were valid more generally , in particular also for lower - metallicity progenitors , it will have implications for the discussion of grb progenitors @xcite . instead of depending on an exact bifurcation value of @xmath5",
    "we see bh formation occurring preferentially ( but not exclusively ) in regions with local maxima of @xmath5 and ns as well as bh formation to be possible for @xmath5 between @xmath10.15 and @xmath10.35 .",
    "the success or failure of the explosion mechanism obviously depends on the progenitor structure ( determining the time - dependent mass - accretion rate , shock radius , and accretion luminosity ) in a complex way and can not be predicted exactly on grounds of a single parameter .",
    "so far we have investigated only solar metallicity progenitors from one modeling group , but we plan to extend our studies also on sets of progenitors from other groups and for different metallicities .",
    "naturally , the spherical symmetry of our simulations is a major constraint , since the explosion mechanism has been recognized to be intrinsically multi - dimensional ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonradial fluid flows in the gain layer have a supportive influence and thus reduce the critical luminosity for driving the explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a higher neutrino - heating efficiency lower values of the early postbounce luminosities from our analytic pns core - cooling model",
    "would be needed to reproduce the explosion properties of sn  1987a .",
    "this , in turn , would stretch the pns cooling timescale , which in our simulations tends to be on the lower side of the range compatible with the sn  1987a neutrino data .",
    "nevertheless , this would only mean a recalibration of the time decay of the core - neutrino source adopted for our modeling , but it is unlikely to fundamentally alter qualitative aspects of the behavior of the different progenitors in relative comparison to each other .",
    "therefore we are hopeful that our basic conclusions will retain their validity also in the multi - dimensional case even if quantitative changes ( for example lower explosion energies by less powerful neutrino - driven winds in low - mass progenitors ) could be the consequence .",
    "it also can not be excluded that some of the extreme sensitivity of 1d explosions to details of the progenitor structure might be moderated or disappear in multi - dimensional models .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the relatively early explosions of the 11.2@xmath0 and 27@xmath0 progenitors of our model set and the later explosion of progenitors around 15@xmath0 are fully compatible with recent results of 2d models with sophisticated neutrino transport ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our findings challenge canonical thinking , e.g.  of the progenitor masses leading to bh formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they raise doubts about claims in the literature that the possible gap between ns and bh masses requires explosions that set in relatively early after core bounce @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a highly variable onset time of the explosion and little fallback for massive progenitors ( i.e. , a low occurrence rate of fallback sne ) naturally leads to the mass gap .",
    "on the other hand , a long delay of the beginning of the explosion is questioned by the recent bayesian analysis of the ns mass distribution in double ns systems by @xcite .",
    "these authors conclude that for solar metallicity stars the explosion most likely develops near the edge of the iron core at a specific entropy of @xmath127 .",
    "it is hard to understand how the explosion mechanism could dynamically couple to this specific pre - collapse value of the entropy , because the core density and entropy profiles are highly variable for the different progenitors , they are modified by the nuclear burning during the collapse phase , and the neutrino - driven mechanism in spherical symmetry as well as in the multi - dimensional case is sensitive to the mass - infall rate rather than the pre - collapse entropy structure . for these reasons the mass - accretion rate and the accretion luminosity exhibit large differences between different progenitors when compared for specific values of the entropy , for which reason a wide range of explosion times appears plausible .",
    "interestingly , however , @xcite favor a ns formation scenario with no or very little mass fallback , which is consistent with the tendency of our models compared to piston - driven explosion models .",
    "correspondingly , the probability distribution computed by @xcite with our predicted remnant masses has little power for ns masses above @xmath11.6@xmath0 even when our fallback masses are included .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical distribution is shifted by @xmath10.1@xmath0 to higher masses relative to the observational double ns data .",
    "if this mismatch can not be attributed to an overestimated delay time of the explosion in our supernova models as argued above , it might be connected to the low - number statistics of the empirical data or might point to smaller iron - cores than present in the solar - metallicity progenitors of our study .",
    "certainly , our simulations can mean only a very first step of systematically exploring the consequences of neutrino - powered explosions for a wide variety of progenitors .",
    "nevertheless , our results already shed new light on a number of important astrophysical questions connected to how the properties of sn explosions and their remnants connect to those of the progenitor stars . while the fundamental dependences of explosion and remnant properties on the progenitor structure are likely to possess more general validity , the detailed functional variation with the progenitor mass is subject to a number of caveats .",
    "these caveats are , in particular , the employed set of progenitor models with their large structural variations even for similar zams masses , the calibration of the neutrino - cooling models of the pns core based on a certain choice of the sn  1987a progenitor model , and the constraint of the explosion modeling to spherical symmetry .",
    "future work will have to explore the consequences of these constraints and deficiencies .",
