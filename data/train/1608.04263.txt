    "single crystals of the ternary phases with pbfcl structure type were grown by chemical transport reaction ( ctr ) using iodine as transport agent  @xcite starting from microcrystalline powders of pre - reacted materials , which were obtained by gradual temperature treatment of mixtures of the elements under inert conditions ( vacuum ) .",

    "various positions of the growing crystals within the sink area of the ampoule may cause differences in chemical composition due to different temperature gradients . for this reason and because of the homogeneity regions of the ternary phases under consideration , it is of crucial importance not only to check the total chemical composition of a crystal but to also investigate the constancy of the chemical composition over the crystal individual by wdxs - analyzes as a function of position .",

    "it will lead us to the conclusion that dynamic scattering centers in the vacancy - containing pnictogen layer of zras@xmath1se@xmath2 are responsible for the observed low - temperature transport anomalies in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "finally , we show that the dynamic scattering centers act as superconducting pair breakers .",
    "thus , the difference in @xmath72 of the two systems is a consequence of this particular type of 2ck `` impurities '' .      in the absence of a magnetic field , superconducting fluctuations",
    "dominate the transport properties of zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 leading to a strong decrease of @xmath13 in a temperature region which significantly exceeds @xmath7k . under these conditions",
    "it is extremely difficult to convincingly separate corrections to the resistivity due to weak localization and eei @xcite .",
    "thus , we have performed experiments at finite magnetic field to suppress superconductivity and to explore the field dependence of the normal - state resistivity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figs2 ] , the relative change of the resistivity normalized to the minimum value , @xmath40 , is shown as a function of @xmath41 for fields up to 14 t ( with field direction parallel to the current along the @xmath29 axis ) .    at @xmath57 t",
    "a small fraction of the zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 sample still displays surface superconductivity below @xmath1171k , while at elevated temperatures , we observe an upturn in @xmath13 which is more complex than the @xmath17 behavior found in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 and is ascribed to weak localization . note that in three dimensions , the corrections to the resistivity coming from eei and the weak - localization correction have different temperature dependencies . in the case of the weak - localization correction ,",
    "the temperature enters only through the relaxation rates for inelastic scattering processes .",
    "the standard way to experimentally extract the correction due to eei is to apply a magnetic field in order to suppress the weak localization  @xcite .",
    "the effect of an external magnetic field is to destroy the phase coherence of the partial electron waves . since weak localization leads to an increase of the resistivity upon cooling , its suppression by a magnetic field results in a negative magnetoresistivity .",
    "a negative mr in the zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 compound is inferred from the @xmath164 t data ( cf .",

    "the @xmath40 correction is smaller than for @xmath57 t . for the largest available field of 14 t",
    ", the low-@xmath12 upturn is strongly reduced , and its magnitude is about 7 times smaller than for @xmath57 t .",
    "several additional observations can be made : the application of a magnetic field shifts the position of @xmath165 towards lower temperatures . as a result , at @xmath56 t the resistivity of zrp@xmath5s@xmath6",
    "is essentially temperature - independent down to liquid - helium temperature , and its rise is restricted to a rather narrow temperature window , i.e. , from above 4.2k to around 1k . at @xmath58 k , the resistivity is found to saturate .",
    "( similar complex behavior in the same temperature regime is already observed for @xmath166 t ) . taken together ,",
    "these experimental findings imply that the absolute value of the weak - localization mr increases upon cooling and amounts to about 0.02% at @xmath167k .",
    "thus , it is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the classical mr ( cf . the inset of fig .  3(c ) of the main text ) .",
    "therefore , the total mr of zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 is essentially temperature independent at @xmath62k and approaches 1.4% at @xmath168 t .",
    "the weak - localization correction to @xmath13 in zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 is in striking contrast to the field - independent @xmath17 term in @xmath13 of zras@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "as we shall conclude below , this term must be caused by the presence of dynamic `` impurities '' that lead to two - channel kondo physics . since two - channel kondo `` impurities '' act as dephasing centers for conduction electrons due to their dynamic nature , no weak - localization correction in @xmath13 is expected .",
    "note that the strong dephasing in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 can not be caused simply by the vacancies .",
    "because of their static nature , vacancies act as elastic scatterer and do not destroy phase coherence . however , this situation changes dramatically when the vacant sites trigger the formation of dynamic scattering centers . quite generally ,",
    "internal quantum degrees of freedom of scatterers lead to dephasing in metals  @xcite . a well known example are magnetic impurities giving rise to spin - flip scattering  @xcite .",
    "if , for the specific case of a kondo impurity , the temperature is reduced to below the kondo temperature , the dephasing time for the standard ( single - channel ) kondo effect diverges for @xmath169 .",
    "in contrast to ( standard ) magnetic kondo impurities where the ground - state singlet has zero entropy , a doubly degenerate two - channel kondo impurity in the non - fermi liquid regime has a nonzero ground state entropy of @xmath170ln2 .",
    "this implies that the dephasing time for the two - channel kondo effect is finite even at @xmath171 @xcite .    the resistivity results for zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 displayed in fig .  [ fig : figs2 ] lead to the conclusion that eei very likely does not contribute to the field - independent @xmath17 term in @xmath13 of zras@xmath1se@xmath2 : for zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 , the @xmath13 upturn at @xmath16=14 t is about 7 times smaller than the one at @xmath57 t . within the eei theory for three - dimensional disordered metals",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : drreei1])-([eq : drreei4 ] ) and discussion below ] , a field - independent correction to the resistivity requires very weak screening ( @xmath172 ) and consequently , a very large value of the diffusion constant , i.e. , @xmath173 cm@xmath74s@xmath52 ( cf .",

    "has been made by zawadowski and vladr  @xcite to explain transport anomalies often seen in metallic glasses .",
    "the model by vladr and zawadowski is based on atoms in double - well potentials that may tunnel from one minimum to the other .",

    "direct tunneling of the atom between the two minima necessarily splits the degeneracy between the two states and thus corresponds to an effective magnetic field .",
    "the conduction electron assisted tunneling of the atom assumes the role of a hybridization term .",
    "the conduction electron spin does not participate in assisted tunneling processes and thus gives rise to two degenerate scattering channels protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this opens up the possibility for the two - level system to flow to the 2ck fixed point . for energies well below the associated kondo temperature",

    "it thus would seem that the existence of non - magnetic 2ck scattering centers in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 is unlikely although our analysis strongly supports their existence .",
    "a way out of this conundrum is to consider dynamical defects with higher symmetry  @xcite .",
    "if the dynamic defect is compatible with a triangular or @xmath205 symmetry , there exists a doublet whose degeneracy is ensured by symmetry . in this case , the low - energy properties are governed by a fixed point that is identical to the two - channel kondo fixed point up to irrelevant operators .",
    "a difficulty with this proposal is that the doublet is usually higher in energy than the singlet . under certain conditions ,",
    "the doublet can become the ground state .",
    "for the case of a defect with triangular symmetry , this has been investigated in ref .",
    "more recently , the case of an su(3)-symmetric defect in a metal was investigated by perturbative and nrg methods and it was found that the level spacing between doublet and singlet always renormalizes down as a result of the coupling to the electronic bath  @xcite . as a result",

    "the comparably small composition range @xmath30 for which two - channel kondo physics has been observed in zras@xmath9se@xmath106 implies that the vacancies in the pnictogen layer are in the dilute limit .",

    "2(b ) are indicative of the occurrence of the dynamic jahn - teller effect in the as ( 2@xmath31 ) layer .",
    "as the jahn - teller distortion develops , the doublet states split and one of them becomes the new ground state .",
    "a finite tunneling rate between the different impurity positions compatible with the overall square symmetry restores the square symmetry through a dynamic jahn - teller effect .",

    "<S> figure  3(b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath40 for two zras@xmath1se@xmath2 specimens with similar elastic relaxation times . in spite of this moderate variation , </S>",
    "<S> the size of the magnetic - field - insensitive @xmath17 term between these samples differs by more than a factor of 3 and hence the @xmath63 coefficient amounts to 0.038 and @xmath64cm / k@xmath65 for samples # 1 and # 2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the afore mentioned results , the experimental observations shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) are at strong variance to the expectation based on enhanced eei in 3d specimens of the same disordered metal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a nearly identical screening factor @xmath54 , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , implies that the magnitude of a hypothetical @xmath40 anomaly would only vary with @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is not observed in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 . in fact , a supposed @xmath17 correction , calculated in respect to the @xmath67-coefficient value of sample # 1 and schematically sketched by a dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , would be substantially smaller than what is experimentally found for sample # 2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( since @xmath63 is field independent , @xmath68 was assumed in our calculations @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the @xmath16-field independent @xmath17 correction to @xmath13 in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 can not be caused by eei and can only be explained by the existence of non - magnetic defects with degenerated ground state which , at low temperatures , place the system near the 2ck fixed point . note that in the dilute limit , where the dynamic scattering centers are independent of each other , the amplitude @xmath67 is proportional to the concentration of dynamic scattering centers in the 2ck regime which is in general smaller than , and not expected to scale in a simple fashion with , the concentration of as vacancies .    </S>",
    "<S> the chemical composition of zras@xmath1se@xmath2 implies that the vacancies in the as layer are in the dilute limit . as discussed above </S>",
    "<S> , our analysis shows that interstitial as does not occur in the pnictogen layer . </S>",
    "<S> each vacancy thus preserves the @xmath3 symmetry of the pnictogen layer . as a result , a jahn - teller distortion forms in the pnictogen layer concomitant with a formation of as dimers or oligomers . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is well known to occur in such square nets of the pbfcl structure - type compounds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the flattened displacement ellipsoids shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) are indicative of the occurrence of the dynamic jahn - teller effect in the as ( 2@xmath31 ) layer . </S>",
    "<S> as the jahn - teller distortion develops , the doublet states split and one of them becomes the new ground state . </S>",
    "<S> a finite tunneling rate between the different impurity positions compatible with the overall square symmetry restores the square symmetry through a dynamic jahn - teller effect , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](c)-(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the group @xmath3 possesses only one - dimensional irreducible representations and one two - dimensional irreducible representation ( irrep ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a non - kramers doublet associated with the dynamic jahn - teller distortion transforms as the two - dimensional irreducible representation of the group @xmath3 , and allows for a two - channel kondo fixed point to occur at sufficiently low energies  @xcite . the pseudo - spin index @xmath69 of the effective 2ck hamiltonian labels the basis states of this two - dimensional subspace  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as a result of the coupling to the conduction electrons the doublet can become the ground state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the doublet is renormalized below the singlet in a wide parameter regime  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion that 2ck centers exist in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 is further corroborated by the low superconducting transition temperature , as compared to zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 , which points to the presence of efficient cooper pair breakers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 2ck effect in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 has been argued to arise out of the non - kramers doublet transforming as the two - dimensional irrep of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the associated basis states of the two - dimensional irrep , labeled by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are time - reversed partners . </S>",
    "<S> expanding the bcs order parameter around the quantum defect will thus have to involve singlets of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the full hamiltonian including the quantum defect involves scattering from one of the basis states of the two - dimensional irrep to the other . </S>",
    "<S> these scattering processes therefore have to break up cooper pairs and thus reduces @xmath48 . for details , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our model is in line with all observed properties of zras@xmath1se@xmath2 and is not susceptible to the difficulties that exist for the 2ck scenario based on two - level systems . the observed suppression of superconductivity in zras@xmath1se@xmath2 as compared to zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 is naturally explained . </S>",
    "<S> a log@xmath12-behavior of @xmath13 is expected for the @xmath12-behavior right above the @xmath14 regime for a 2ck system , which is indeed observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct evidence of the dynamic scattering centers could come from scanning tunneling spectroscopy apt to zoom into one of these dynamic scattering centers . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the @xmath16-independent @xmath17-term in @xmath13 of zras@xmath1se@xmath2 is triggered by non - magnetic centers with a local quantum degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that a dynamic jahn - teller effect concomitant with the formation of as oligomers places the scattering center in the vicinity of the orbital two - channel kondo fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> these quantum impurities act as efficient cooper pair breakers which explains the suppression of @xmath72 of zras@xmath1se@xmath2 as compared to the homologue zrp@xmath5s@xmath6 we expect that similar dynamic scattering centers occur in other materials pbfcl structure type with square nets of pnictogen .    </S>",
