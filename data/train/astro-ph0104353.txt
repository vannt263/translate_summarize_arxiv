    "g266.2@xmath01.2  was discovered by aschenbach @xcite using data from the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "situated along the line of sight to the vela snr , the emission stands out above the soft thermal emission from vela only at energies above @xmath1  kev .",
    "iyudin et al .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of @xmath2ti from the source gro  j0852 - 4642 , which was tentatively associated with the snr .",
    "if correct , the very short @xmath2ti lifetime ( @xmath3  y ) would imply a very young snr , and the large angular size would require that the remnant be very nearby as well .",
    "estimates based on the x - ray diameter and @xmath4-ray flux of @xmath2ti indicate an age of @xmath5  y and a distance of @xmath6  pc @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum , if interpreted as high temperature emission from a fast shock , would seem to support this scenario .",
    "however , as we summarize here ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , the x - ray emission is not from hot , shock - heated gas ; it is nonthermal . further , reanalysis of the comptel data finds that the @xmath2ti detection is only significant at the @xmath7 confidence level @xcite . in the absence of such emission , and given that the x - ray emission is nonthermal , the nearby distance and young age may need to be reexamined .",
    "we have carried out asca observations of g266.2@xmath01.2  using 7 pointings , each of @xmath8  ks duration . the resulting image from the asca gis",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 @xcite , where we also present gis spectra from three regions along the rim of the remnant : 1 ) the bright nw rim ; 2 ) the ne rim ; and 3 ) the w rim .",
    "unlike the line - dominated thermal emission typical of a young snr , the spectra are featureless and well described by a power law of index @xmath9 .",
    "g266.2@xmath01.2  thus joins sn  1006 @xcite and g347.3@xmath00.5 @xcite as a shell - type snr dominated by nonthermal emission in x - rays .",
    "weaker nonthermal components are observed for other snrs as well , indicating the shock - acceleration of particles to energies of order @xmath10  tev .    the best - fit spectral parameters for g266.2@xmath01.2  yield @xmath11 .",
    "we include a soft thermal component with the column density fixed at a low value appropriate for vela @xcite .",
    "the column density for the power law component is significantly higher than that for vela .",
    "while simple scaling of the column density to estimate the distance to g266.2@xmath01.2  is clearly rather uncertain , it would appear that the remnant is at least several times more distant than vela ; improved column density measurements are of considerable importance .",
    "co data @xcite reveal a concentration of giant molecular clouds  the vela molecular ridge  at a distance of @xmath12  kpc in the direction of vela .",
    "the column density through the ridge is in excess of @xmath13 , with the ne rim of g266.2@xmath01.2  ( nearest the galactic plane ) falling along the steeply increasing column density region while the western rim lies along a line of much lower @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "2 ) ; the co column density varies by more than a factor of 6 between these regions .",
    "the lack of a strong variation in @xmath14 across g266.2@xmath01.2  indicates that the remnant can not be more distant than the ridge . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath14 is much larger than for the vela snr , as the gis data reported here indicate , then g266.2@xmath01.2  must be as distant as possible consistent with being in front of most of the molecular ridge gas .",
    "in a recent study of optical emission in the vicinity of g266.2@xmath01.2 , redman et al .",
    "@xcite discuss a filamentary nebula lying directly along the edge of the so - called vela `` bullet d '' region @xcite , just outside the eastern edge of fig . 1 ( in the direction of the extended contour ) , and argue that both structures represent a breakout region from g266.2@xmath01.2 . however , the asca spectrum of this region ( fig .",
    "2 ) is clearly thermal , with large overabundances of o , mg , and si  quite in contrast to the nonthermal spectrum observed for g266.2@xmath01.2 .",
    "we conclude that an association between this region and g266.2@xmath01.2  is unlikely .",
    "the central region of the remnant contains a compact source , which we designate as ax  j0851.9 - 4617.4 , surrounded by diffuse emission that extends toward the northwest .",
    "the diffuse emission is well described by a power law of spectral index @xmath15 , again accompanied by a soft thermal component that we associate with vela . given the nonthermal nature of the shell emission , however , it is quite possible that the diffuse central emission is associated with emission from the shell projected along the central line of sight .",
    "we note that the spectrum of this central emission appears harder than that from the rest of the remnant , perhaps suggesting a plerionic nature , but more sensitive observations are required to clarify this .",
    "the spectrum of the compact source is rather sparse and can be adequately described by a variety of models .",
    "a power - law fit yields a spectral index that is rather steep compared with known pulsars .",
    "the luminosity , on the other hand , is quite reasonable for a young neutron star if the distance is indeed several kpc , and the observed column density is compatible with that for the snr shell .",
    "a blackbody model leads to an inferred surface temperature of @xmath16  kev with an emitting region only @xmath17 in radius which could be indicative of emission from compact polar cap regions of a neutron star , although this region is somewhat large for such a scenario .",
    "it is possible that the source is associated with a be star within the position error circle @xcite , although the x - ray and optical properties appear inconsistent for such an interpretation @xcite .",
    "recent sax observations @xcite have revealed the presence of another source in the central region of g266.2@xmath01.2 .",
    "this source , designated sax  j0852.0 - 4615 , has a harder spectrum than ax  j0851.9 - 4617.4 , but is considerably fainter .",
    "if at a distance of @xmath18  kpc , its luminosity would be similar to the vela pulsar , but this would place the source beyond the vela molecular ridge .",
    "further observations are required to investigate these central sources more completely .",
    "the asca observations of g266.2@xmath01.2  reveal that the soft x - ray emission from this snr is dominated by nonthermal processes .",
    "this brings to three the number of snrs in this class , and provides additional evidence for shock acceleration of cosmic rays in snrs .",
    "because of the bright and spatially varying background caused by the vela snr , limits on the thermal emission from g266.2@xmath01.2  are difficult to establish . however , the asca data suggest a larger column density for this remnant than for vela , indicating that g266.2@xmath01.2  is at a larger distance , and perhaps associated with the star formation region located at a distance of @xmath19  kpc . the point source ax  j0851.9 - 4617.4 could represent an associated neutron star , with the diffuse emission around the source being an associated synchrotron nebula , albeit a very faint one .",
    "recent sax studies reveal another possible candidate .",
    "higher resolution x - ray observations of these sources are of considerable importance .",
