    "because of their extreme luminosities grbs are detectable out to large distances by current missions , and due to their connection to core collapse sne @xcite , they could in principal reveal the stars that form from the first dark matter halos ( @xmath1 2030 ) through to the epoch of reionization at @xmath2 and closer @xcite . as bright continuum sources , grb afterglows also make ideal backlights to probe the intergalactic medium as well as the interstellar medium in their host galaxies . predicted to occur at redshifts beyond those where quasars are expected",
    ", they could be used to study both the reionization history and metal enrichment of the early universe @xcite .",
    "the fraction of detectable grbs that lie at high redshift ( @xmath3 ) is , however , expected to be small ( @xmath410% ; @xcite ) . until recently there were only two grbs with measured redshifts @xmath3 ; grb050904 @xcite and grb080913 @xcite with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "however , on april 23 , 2009 the _ swift _  burst alert telescope ( bat ) discovered grb 090423   and the on - board x - ray telescope ( xrt ) detected and localized a variable x - ray afterglow @xcite . in ground - based follow - up observations no optical counterpart was found but a fading afterglow was detected by several groups at wavelengths longward of j band ( 1.2 @xmath7 m ) .",
    "based on both broadband photometry and near infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy , the sharp optical / nir drop off was argued to be due to the lyman-@xmath8 absorption in the intergalactic medium , consistent with a redshift with a best - fit value of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the high redshift of grb 090423   makes it the most distant observed grb , as well as the most distant object of any kind other than the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this event occurred approximately 630 million years after the big bang , confirming that massive stellar formation occurred in the very early universe .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of the radio afterglow from grb 090423with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "broadband afterglow observations provide constraints on the explosion energetics , geometry , and immediate environs of the progenitor star .",
    "the afterglow has a predictable temporal and spectral evolution that depends on the kinetic energy and geometry of the shock , the density structure of the circumburst environment , and shock microphysical parameters which depend on the physics of particle acceleration and the circumburst magnetic field .",
    "to the degree that we can predict differences in the explosion and circumburst media between grb progenitors at high and low redshifts , we can search for these different signatures in their afterglows .",
    "this has been the motivation for previous multi - wavelength modeling of the highest-@xmath10 afterglows @xcite .    in order to investigate the nature of the grb 090423  explosion , we combine our radio measurements with published x - ray and nir observations , and apply a model of the blast wave evolution to fit the afterglow data (  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we compare the explosion energetics , circumburst density , and other derived characteristics to a sample of well - studied events , and discuss prospects for using afterglow measurements to investigate the nature of high-@xmath10 massive star progenitors .",
    "we began observing a field centered at the nir afterglow of grb 090423   with the vla about one day after the burst @xcite .",
    "our first detection of the grb afterglow was not until about one week later at a flux density of @xmath11 @xmath7jy .",
    "we continued to monitor the grb with the vla until it faded below detection on day 64 .",
    "the flux density scale was tied to 3c286 and the phase was measured by switching with a 6.5 minute cycle time between the grb field and the point source calibrator j0954 + 177 . to maximize sensitivity , the full vla continuum bandwidth ( 100 mhz )",
    "was recorded in two 50 mhz bands .",
    "data reduction was carried out following standard practice in the _ aips _ software package .    in table",
    "[ tab : radio ] we list the _ individual _ vla measurements . in order to improve our detection sensitivity , we averaged several adjacent observations .",

    "this position is consistent with an earlier , less accurate wfcam - ukirt position from @xcite .",

    "the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) also observed the grb between 2009 may 22.48 ut to 23.46 ut at 4.9 ghz and did not detect the afterglow @xcite .      _",

    "we converted the @xmath19 kev counts to a flux density at @xmath20kev ( @xmath21hz ) using the above value for @xmath22 and an unabsorbed count rate conversion of 1 count @xmath23 erg/@xmath24/s .",
    "the nir afterglow was observed by a variety of facilities worldwide ; we have used values from @xcite . to convert magnitudes to flux densities",
    ", we used zero - point measurements from @xcite .",
    "we have incorporated the galactic extinction ( @xmath25 ; @xcite ) into these results .",
    "here we combine our radio data with the existing x - ray and nir data and model the afterglow evolution , interpreting it in terms of the relativistic blast wave model @xcite . in this model the afterglow physics is governed by the isotropic kinetic energy of the blast wave shock @xmath26 , the jet opening angle @xmath27 , the density of the circumburst medium @xmath28 , and the microscopic parameters such as electron energy index @xmath29 , and the fraction of the shock energy density in relativistic electrons @xmath30 and magnetic fields @xmath31 .",
    "the afterglow modeling software @xcite assumes a standard synchrotron forward shock formulation . in the x - ray band",
    ", we exclude the data before @xmath32 3900 s , since it contains a flare which is more likely due to the grb itself than the afterglow .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the afterglow framework allows the above blast wave parameters to be constrained using multi - wavelength light curves .",
    "first , we note the constancy of the peak flux density ( @xmath33 ) between the nir and the radio bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] .",
    "if we interpret this as the passage of the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath34 through each band , this immediately rules out the wind model ( @xmath35 ) and favors a constant - density ambient medium ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "another related constraint which comes from the fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] is the time of the peak in the nir versus the radio bands .",
    "we note that in the nir band , the light curve peaks at @xmath37 d. thus if there was an early jet break the model predicts that the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath34 would evolve from nir to radio band around day 10 ( @xmath38 ) , however , for the isotropic model @xmath34 should pass through the 8.5 ghz band around @xmath39 days ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "since radio light curve indeed peaks at about 50 d , this confirms that the jet break has not occurred at least until the afterglow peaked in radio band .",
    "second , the declining part of the ir light curve is well fit by a power law with a decay index @xmath41 . whereas the overall x - ray light curve after 3900s is well fit with a power law index of @xmath42 . for the isotropic , constant density model",
    "we expect the flux at a given frequency @xmath43 to decline as @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the synchrotron cooling frequency @xcite .",
    "these relations give consistent values of @xmath29 for the nir ( @xmath49 ) and x - ray ( @xmath50 ) .    finally , having obtained an estimation for @xmath29 and determining the fact the x - ray frequency has evolved past the cooling frequency @xmath51 , we can put a constraint on the total energy carried by the fireball electrons ( @xmath52 ) just from a single x - ray flux measurement . using eq .",
    "4 of @xcite and x - ray flux on day 1 , we obtain the fireball electron energy per unit solid angle in an opening angle @xmath53 on @xmath54 d to be @xmath55 ergs .",
    "if we assume @xmath56 @xcite , then the total fireball energy per unit solid angle in this opening will be @xmath57 ergs .",
    "we summarize our robust inferences based on this preliminary analysis : ( a ) the data favors an isotropic explosion in a constant density medium ; ( b ) the cooling frequency lies between the ir and x - ray bands ; ( c ) the afterglow kinetic energy is large . from @xcite",
    "we also know that the extinction due to a putative host galaxy is negligible ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we now move on to more detailed modeling @xcite guided broadly by these preliminary results .",
    "we fit a constant density model for parameters : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "all parameters were allowed to vary freely except that we fixed @xmath59 to lie in a narrow range ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the best fit parameters are tabulated in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "our best fit model is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] .",
    "this simple model provides a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "the model implies grb kinetic energy to be @xmath61 erg .",
    "however , the last measured data point is around day 65 ( radio band ) and the last detections in the radio and nir bands are at about day 40 and day 46 , respectively .",
    "therefore a late jet break can not be ruled out by these data . to illustrate this more concretely we overlay our best - fit model in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] with a late jet break @xmath62 d. the implied jet opening angle @xmath63 rad reduces both the radiated and the kinetic energies of this event by a factor of @xmath64 . in this case the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy e@xmath65 erg @xcite and the blastwave kinetic energy @xmath66 erg give _ lower limits _ to the beaming - corrected values of @xmath67 erg and @xmath68 erg , respectively .",
    "the radio data point on day 9.34 ( @xmath69 d in the rest frame ) has high flux and does not go through the best fit forward shock model . such early , short - lived radio emission is fairly common in grbs at lower redshifts and is thought to be due to a contribution from afterglow reverse shock ( rs ) @xcite .",
    "we can make a rough estimate of the peak rs contribution for grb 090423using the formulation of @xcite and the best fit parameters .",
    "the order of magnitude calculation shows that the rs contribution is expected to be @xmath70 @xmath7jy .",
    "even though this estimate may have large uncertainties , this does support our speculation that the rs is likely contributed some of the radio emission seen on @xmath71 d. if we assume that the data on day 9.34 represents the peak of the reverse shock then this corresponds to a synchrotron self absorption frequency of @xmath72 hz . using the scaling law for rs emission , @xmath73 ,",
    "the time for rs peak in 90 ghz is @xmath74 d. this implies that pdbi data flux reported by @xcite may also have contribution from the rs .",
    "grb 090423  is the highest - redshift object for which we have multi - wavelength observations , including good quality radio measurements . below we address the following questions : based on its afterglow properties what can we learn about properties of the explosion and environs for this highest - redshift grb ? and , can we identify any differences between high and low redshift grbs which indicate that they might arise from different progenitors ?",
    "in particular , the initial generations of stars in the early universe are thought to be brighter , hotter and more massive ( @xmath75 ) than stars today @xcite .",
    "detecting these so - called population iii ( pop iii ) stars is one of the central observational challenges in modern cosmology , and the best prospect appears to be through observing their stellar death @xcite via a supernovae ( sne ) or gamma - ray burst explosion .",
    "it is worth asking what observational signatures could signal a pop iii grb .",
    "other than grb 090423 , only one other @xmath76 event , grb050904 ( @xmath0 ) , has high quality broadband afterglow measurements . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we plot the best - fit parameters of these two grbs along with a sample of well - studied lower redshift events from @xcite .",
    "both high redshift bursts stand out in terms of their large blast wave energy ( @xmath77 erg ) .",
    "we know from samples of well - studied afterglows @xcite , that most have radiative and kinetic energies of order @xmath78 erg . in the collapsar model",
    "the jet kinetic energy from a pop iii grb could be 10100 times larger than a population ii ( pop ii ) event @xcite .",
    "however , an energetic explosion does not appear to be an exclusive property of high-@xmath10 grbs .",
    "there is a small but growing population of bursts with energy @xmath77 erg , termed hyper - energetic grbs @xcite , which includes moderate-@xmath10 events like grb070125 @xcite and grb050820a @xcite .",
    "another potentially useful diagnostic is the density structure in the immediate environs of the progenitor star .",
    "the radio data is a sensitive _ in situ _ probe of the density because its emission samples the optically thick part of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the afterglows of grb 090423  and grb050904 are best fit by a constant density medium and not one that is shaped by stellar mass loss @xcite",
    ". however , many afterglows at all redshifts are best fit by a constant density medium ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the density obtained for grb050904 was the highest seen ( @xmath79 @xmath80 ) for any grb to date , while grb 090423  with @xmath81 @xmath80 does not stand out ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) , indicating these two high redshift bursts exploded in very different environments . a circumburst density of order unity",
    "is predicted for pop iii stars , since this density is limited by strong radiation pressure in the mini halo from which the star was formed @xcite .",
    "this is not an unique property , since many local sne explode in tenuous media , and so density constraints are not useful to signal pop iii explosions .    for the other afterglow parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath27 ) there are no published predictions for how they may differ between different progenitor models .",
    "thus we turn to considering the prompt high - energy emission of grb 090423 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both noted that the high - energy properties of grb 090423  ( fluence , luminosity , duration , radiative energy ) are not substantially different from those moderate-@xmath10 grbs .",
    "we are not aware of any quantitative predictions based on these observed properties that would discriminate between popii and popiii progenitors .",
    "for example , apart from the effect of ( @xmath82 ) time dilation , there is no reason to expect high-@xmath10 grbs to have significantly longer intrinsic durations .",
    "collapsar models which form black holes promptly through accretion onto the proto - neutron star ( type i ) or via direct massive ( @xmath83 m@xmath84 ) black hole formation ( type iii ) have durations set by jet propagation and disk viscosity timescales , respectively @xcite , which are @xmath85 s in the rest frame ( with large uncertainties ; @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity can also be an important discriminant .",
    "there is a critical metallicity ( @xmath86 ) below which high - mass pop iii stars dominate @xcite .",
    "the contribution of pop iii stars to the co - moving star formation rate is expected to peak around @xmath87 but their redshift distribution exhibits a considerable spread to @xmath17 .",
    "thus we might find high - redshift grbs with pop iii progenitors in `` pockets '' of low metallicity .",
    "@xcite argue for a lower bound of @xmath88 based on their detection of excess soft x - ray absorption by metals along the line of sight , in comparison to the milky way column density predicted from ( 21 cm ) measurements .",
    "we do not consider this a robust measurement as it is sensitive to a range of unaccounted - for systematic effects , including : spectral variability ; spectral curvature ; low - amplitude x - ray flares ; and the presence of intervening ( cosmological ) absorption systems along the line of sight .    summarizing the above discussion",
    ", we do not find that the individual properties of grb 090423  are sufficiently dissimilar to other grbs to warrant identifying it as anything other than a normal grb .",
    "we lack robust predictions of well - defined afterglow signatures that could allow us to unambiguously identify a pop iii progenitor star from its afterglow properties alone",
    ". significantly larger numbers of grbs at high redshift with well - sampled afterglow light curves , high - resolution spectra , and host galaxy detections are needed to determine if high redshift grb progenitors differ in a statistical sense from those at low redshift .",
    "we note that , like grb050904 , the grb 090423  afterglow indicates the signature of reverse shock ( rs ) emission in the radio , as seen in the vla and pdbi data . @xcite",
    "have studied the expected rs emission at high redshift , and they find that the effects of time dilation almost compensate for frequency redshift , resulting in a near - constant observed peak frequency in the mm band ( @xmath89  ghz ) at a few hours post - event , and a flux at this frequency that is almost independent of redshift .",
    "further , the mm band does not suffer significantly either from extinction ( in contrast to the optical ) or scintillation ( in contrast to the radio ) .",
    "therefore , detection of mm flux at a few hours post event should be a good method of indicating a high redshift explosion .",
    "alma , with its high sensitivity ( @xmath3275 @xmath7jy in 4 min ) , will be a potential tool for selecting potential high-@xmath10 bursts that would be high priority for intense followup across the spectrum .",
    "this will hopefully greatly increase the rate at which high-@xmath10 events are identified .",
    "finally , our data does not rule out a late jet break at @xmath90 d , which , as discussed above , makes the total explosion energy uncertain .",
    "extremely sensitive vla observations would be required to distinguish between the isotropic versus jet model .",
    "however , in 2010 with an order of magnitude enhanced sensitivity the evla will be the perfect instrument for such studies . for a 2hr integration in 8 ghz band , the evla can reach sensitivity up to 2.3 @xmath7jy which will be able to detect the grb 090423  for 2 years or 6 months if the burst is isotropic or jet - like , respectively .",
    "evla will thus be able detect fainter events and follow events like grb050904 and grb 090423  for a longer duration , therefore obtaining better density measurements , better estimates of outflow geometry and the total kinetic energy .",
    "we thank bob dickman for his generous allocation of vla time and joan wrobel and mark claussen for the timely scheduling of the observations . this work made use of data supplied by the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester .",
