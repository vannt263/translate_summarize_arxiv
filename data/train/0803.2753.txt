    "millimeter - wave interferometers have imaged the gas and dust surrounding over a dozen t tauri and herbig ae stars ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these studies demonstrate the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of disk physical and chemical structure , providing insights that will ultimately enable a more comprehensive understanding of star and planet formation . as analogs to the solar nebula ,",
    "these circumstellar disks offer a unique opportunity to study the conditions during the planet formation process , especially the complex chemical evolution that must occur . in the outer parts of the disk directly accessible to millimeter - wave interferometry , observations of deuterated species are particularly important because they can constrain the origin of primitive solar system bodies such as comets and other icy planetesimals .",
    "deuterated molecule chemistry is sensitive to the temperature history of interstellar and circumstellar gas , as well as to density - sensitive processes such as molecular depletion in the cold ( @xmath8 20 k ) and dense ( @xmath14 10@xmath15 @xmath16 ) disk midplane .",
    "the similarity of molecular d / h ratios between comets and high mass hot cores has been used to argue for an `` interstellar '' origin of cometary matter , but ambiguity remains and this argument is not secure ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite investigate the chemistry of deuterium - bearing molecules in outer regions of protoplanetary disks and find that molecules formed in the disk have similar d / h ratios as those in comets . to date , the determination of d / h ratios in disks has been limited to the measurements of dco@xmath0/hco@xmath0 in two classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) with single dish telescopes ( tw  hydrae , van dishoeck et al . 2003 ; dm  tauri , guilloteau et al .",
    "2006 ) , but dco@xmath0 has not been observed in comets .",
    "although h@xmath3d@xmath0 and hdo lines have been detected in disks ( ceccarelli et al . 2004 , 2005 ) , there are no corresponding h@xmath17 and h@xmath3o observations that allow derivations of the d / h ratio .",
    "therefore , direct measurements in disks of species observed in comets , such as dcn and hcn , will be important to help relate deuterium fractionation in disks to that in comets",
    ".    deuterated molecules in cold pre - stellar and protostellar cores are found to be enhanced by orders of magnitude over the elemental d / h abundance ratio of 1.5@xmath1210@xmath18 through fractionation in the gas phase at low temperatures , an effect driven primarily by deuterated h@xmath17 , which is formed by exchange reaction between h@xmath17 and hd , then transfers its deuteron to neutral species .",
    "theoretical models of disks ( @xcite ) with realistic temperature and density structure show that the dco@xmath0/hco@xmath0 ratio increases with radius due to the decreasing temperature moving out from the star .",
    "spatially resolved data of deuterated molecules will help test disk physical models through these chemical consequences .",
    "the current capabilities of millimeter - wave observatories are limited both by sensitivity and by the small angular size of circumstellar disks , which makes spatially resolving the deuterium fractionation difficult . in this work",
    "we take advantage of the proximity of the most nearby classical t tauri star , tw  hydrae , which is surrounded by a disk of radius @xmath19 , or 200 au at a distance of 56 pc ( @xcite ) , and a possible orbiting planet of mass ( 9.8@xmath113.3 ) m@xmath20 at 0.04 au ( @xcite ) , to study the physical and chemical structure of a protoplanetary environment at high spatial and spectral resolution using interferometry .",
    "the tw  hydrae disk is viewed nearly face - on , and so is well posed to investigate the radial distribution of molecular emission . although the current angular resolution of @xmath2112@xmath22 places only a few independent beams ( or ` pixels ' ) across the disk , effectively improved resolution of the disk chemistry can be achieved thanks to the fact that the gas kinematics are essentially keplerian .",
    "@xcite show that molecular line emission from keplerian disks displays a `` dipole '' pattern near the systematic velocity due to the shear created by the orbital motion .",
    "the emission near the systemic velocity is dominated by the outer disk regions , and the separation of the emission peaks depends sensitively on the abundance gradient of the emitting species with radius .",
    "this important feature , commonly seen in velocity channel maps of disks with a range of inclination angles ( even as small as 67 degrees in the case of tw  hydrae , @xcite ) , may be used to study the radial distribution of molecular emission far more precisely than is afforded by the limited number of `` pixels '' provided by the available resolution .",
    "here we report on submillimeter array ( sma ) ( @xcite ) observations of deuterated species in the disk around tw  hydrae , including the first detection and images of dcn and dco@xmath0 . in ",

    "[ fig : dcomodels],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    examination of the channel maps shows upon inspection that the radial distributions of dco@xmath0 and hco@xmath0 are different . to demonstrate how differences in the radial distribution affect the resulting images ,",

    "the contrast of the contour levels between the central channel and the adjacent channels are also smaller in the data than in this model . because the emission of the central channel mostly originates at large disk radii",
    ", these differences suggest that the dco@xmath0 emission arising from the outer regions of the disk is stronger than predicted by this model .",
    "the slope of radial dco@xmath0 distribution does not decrease as steeply as does hco@xmath0 .",
    "in other words , the d / h ratio must increase with increasing radius .",
    "model 2 shows the best - fit result for the radial distribution of dco@xmath0 assuming a single power index .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : coldens ] , the radial distribution of dco@xmath0 is strikingly different from that of hco@xmath0 , with a positive power index of 2.4 and a smaller but better constrained r@xmath31 90@xmath115 au .",
    "the contours of the iso-@xmath29 surface for dco@xmath0 in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : chi ] indicate that the uncertainty of the radial power index is very large but that the index is still larger than 1.6 within the 1@xmath32 error , much larger than @xmath332.9 found for hco@xmath0 .",
    "the simulated dco@xmath0 channel maps for model 2 shown in figure  [ fig : dcomodelmaps ] are an improvement over model 1 in matching the data .",
    "however in this model , r@xmath31 ( @xmath21 90 au ) is much smaller than the disk radius observed with hco@xmath0 and co ( @xmath21 200 au ) and dco@xmath0 increases with radius but then disappears sharply at r@xmath31@xmath2190 au , as a step function , which is hard to understand .",
    "comparison with the data shows that there are fewer complete contours around the double peaks in the central channel , which suggests that the dco@xmath0 emission is maximum at an intermediate radius rather than at the edge .    for model 3 , instead of using a single power index ( p ) to fit for the radial distribution of dco@xmath0 column density n(dco@xmath0 )",
    ", the fit uses two power indices ( p1 and p2 ) and a turning point ( r@xmath39 ) where the power law index changes from p1 to p2 , i.e. the location of the peak of n(dco@xmath0 ) .",
    "the parameters p1 , p2 and r@xmath39 are searched within limited grids to minimize @xmath29 . in this model ,",
    "n(dco@xmath0 ) is found to increase with radius out to @xmath40  au , and then to decrease .",
    "table 3 presents the best - fit parameters ; no error estimation is provided due to the computation difficulties .",
    "figure  [ fig : dcomodelmaps ] shows the best - fit model images .",
    "comparison of model 3 with the data shows a visual improvement over model 2 in the central channel , although the @xmath29 value of the two models are not distinguishable .",
    "we thus can not clearly discriminate with the @xmath29 statistic if there is indeed a peak with radius for n(dco@xmath0 ) as in model 3 , or if dco@xmath0 increases with radius and disappears suddenly around 90 au as in model 2 .",
    "even with this ambiguity , however , both models imply that the d / h ratios change by at least an order of magnitude ( 0.01 to 0.1 ) from radii @xmath830 au to @xmath1470 au and that there is a rapid falloff of n(dco@xmath0 ) at radii larger than 90 au .",
    "because the emission in the central channel comes from the outer part of the disk ( keplerian rotation ) projected along the line - of - sight with a very small inclination of around 7 degrees for tw  hydrae , the central velocity channel is most important for constraining the radial distribution .",
    "based on the difference in the central velocity channel map between the models , we believe model 3 is the more plausible description of the radial distribution of dco@xmath0 . figure  [ fig : dcomap ] shows the channel maps of the dco@xmath0 j=32 emission , together with those of model 3 and the data - model residuals .",
    "observations of deuterated molecular ions and the level of deuterium fractionation have been used to estimate the ionization degree in molecular clouds , and a similar analysis can be applied to circumstellar disks . if we consider only the ionization balance determined by hco@xmath0 , h@xmath17 , dco@xmath0 and electrons in steady state as shown in equation 14 of @xcite , the electron fractional abundance can be derived to be around 10@xmath41 .",
    "of course , this value is only valid in the intermediate layer where hco@xmath0 is abundant and multiply deuterated h@xmath17 is less abundant than hco@xmath0 .",
    "several important complications are also neglected in this analysis , including the presence of other atomic and molecular ions , neutral species besides co which destroy h@xmath3d@xmath0 , and negatively charged dust grains and refractory metals . still , accurate measurements of dco@xmath0 and hco@xmath0 are the first steps toward an understanding of the ionization fraction in the disk .",
    "the increase of d / h ratios from inner to outer disk is generally consistent with the current theoretical models of the gas - deuterium fractionation processes that consider the effect of cold temperature .",
    "but the quick disappearance of dco@xmath0 at radii beyond 90 au ( comparing with r@xmath31 around 200 au for co and hco@xmath0 ) is puzzling , since dco@xmath0 is expected to be abundant and observable in the cold outer region of the disk where hco@xmath0 is still available .",
    "more theoretical work is needed to explain the disappearance of dco@xmath0 in the outer part of the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : hcnmap ] shows the hcn j=32 channel maps , together with the best fit model and residuals .",
    "table 3 lists the best - fit model parameters , and figure  [ fig : coldens ] shows the radial distribution of column density derived .",
    "the @xmath29 surface shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : chi ] indicates r@xmath31 100@xmath1110 au and p@xmath42 @xmath331.0@xmath111.2 .",
    "the radial power index is poorly constrained probably due to more complex distributions for hcn .",
    "a detailed comparison of the molecular distributions of hcn and cn will be presented elsewhere .",
    "although the best fit vertical parameters seem to indicate that hcn ( @xmath43 ) is found much deeper toward the midplane than is hco@xmath0 ( @xmath44 ) , we emphasize that we are not able to accurately constrain the vertical distributions from the present data .",
    "this ambiguity strongly affects the column density of hcn ( i.e. @xmath45(10au ) ) needed to fit the data ( not the power index p@xmath42 of radial distribution )",
    ". a worse fit to the data ( @xmath29 larger by 3@xmath32 over the best - fit model ) can be obtained by assuming that the vertical distributions of hcn and hco@xmath0 are the same , but the hcn column density is 1.5 times larger than that needed for the best fit model due to higher density near the midplane .",
    "the dcn j=32 transition is detected at a signal - to - noise ratio of 3 near the fitted hcn v@xmath35 of 2.73 km  s@xmath28 ( figure  [ fig : specdata ] ) . while this signal - to - noise ratio is not high , the significance of the detection",
    "is further supported by the channel maps ( figure  [ fig : dcnmap ] upper panel ) where the velocity gradient along the disk position angle of @xmath21 @xmath3330@xmath46 is consistent with that seen in co j=21 and j=32 ( @xcite ) and the other molecular lines presented in this paper . since the dcn 32 emission is weak , we are not able to fit for the molecular distribution and so make the simplifying assumption that the distribution of dcn follows that of hcn . as with h@xmath7co@xmath0",
    ", we fit the dcn / hcn ratio over the whole disk and determine the dcn / hcn ratio to be 1.7@xmath110.5 @xmath12 10@xmath13 . to again emphasize the impact of the assumed vertical distribution on the derived column densities , the dcn / hcn ratio could be as high as 5 @xmath12 10@xmath13 if hcn and dcn are distributed vertically over the same region as is hco@xmath0 .",
    "highly fractionated dcn / hcn ratios have been measured in comets . in the coma of comet hale - bopp ,",
    "for example , @xcite reported the ratio to be around 2.3 @xmath12 10@xmath47 , but higher dcn / hcn ratios ",
    "( d / h)@xmath48 @xmath490.025 are detected from the pristine material sublimed from icy grains ejected in jets from the nucleus which may present a more representative sampling of cometary ices that have not experienced significant thermal processing ( @xcite ) .",
    "such ratios are consistent with those found here in the tw  hydrae disk , indicating that high d / h ratios in comets could originate from material in the outer regions of disks where _ in situ _ deuterium fractionation is ongoing , rather than requiring an inheritance from interstellar material .      in the disk midplane ,",
    "h@xmath3 is expected to be gaseous and the molecular ion formed by the cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath3 , h@xmath17 , is expected to be the most abundant ion .",
    "unfortunately , h@xmath17 is only detectable in cold gas via infrared absorption . in its deuterated forms , however , h@xmath3d@xmath0 and",
    "even d@xmath3h@xmath0 are expected to be abundant in the cold , dense gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ground - state transition of ortho - h@xmath3d@xmath0 was first detected in a young stellar object ( ngc 1333 iras 4a ) by  @xcite and in a prestellar core ( l1544 ) by  @xcite .",

    "<S> we present submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of several deuterated species in the disk around the classical t tauri star tw  hydrae at arcsecond scales , including detections of the dcn j=32 and dco@xmath0 j=32 lines , and upper limits to the hdo 3@xmath12@xmath2 , ortho - h@xmath3d@xmath0 1@xmath41@xmath5 and para - d@xmath3h@xmath0 1@xmath41@xmath6 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we also present observations of the hcn j=32 , hco@xmath0 j=32 and h@xmath7co@xmath0 j=43 lines for comparison with their deuterated isotopologues . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the radial and vertical distributions of various species in the disk by fitting the data using a model where the molecular emission from an irradiated accretion disk is sampled with a 2d monte carlo radiative transfer code . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution of dco@xmath0 differs markedly from that of hco@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the d / h ratios inferred change by at least one order of magnitude ( 0.01 to 0.1 ) for radii @xmath830 au to @xmath970 au and there is a rapid falloff of the abundance of dco@xmath0 at radii larger than 90 au . using a simple analytical chemical model , we constrain the degree of ionization , x(e-)=n(e-)/n(h@xmath3 ) , to be @xmath10 in the disk layer(s ) where these molecules are present . provided the distribution of dcn follows that of hcn , the ratio of dcn to hcn is determined to be 1.7@xmath110.5 @xmath12 10@xmath13 ; however , this ratio is very sensitive to the poorly constrained vertical distribution of hcn . </S>",
    "<S> the resolved radial distribution of dco@xmath0 indicates that _ in situ _ deuterium fractionation remains active within the tw  hydrae disk and must be considered in the molecular evolution of circumstellar accretion disks . </S>"
