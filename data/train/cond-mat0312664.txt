    "+ strontium ruthenate ( sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) is widely believed to be a spin triplet superconductor@xcite , however the theoretical model and particular pairing mechanism are still hotly debated @xcite .",
    "its lattice structure resembles the layered structure of the cuprate la@xmath5ba@xmath6cuo@xmath1 but , instead of high temperature d - wave superconductivity , the superconducting phase of strontium ruthenate ( @xmath7k ) appears to be p - wave or f - wave in nature .",
    "the strongest evidence for this comes from the @xmath8o nmr knight shift data@xcite and neutron scattering experiments@xcite which indicate that the in - plane pauli spin susceptibility is constant below @xmath9 .",
    "these experiments could be naturally explained with a triplet pairing state @xmath10 in exact analogy with the abm phase of superfluid @xmath11he .",
    "the @xmath12sr experiments@xcite also indicate a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry at @xmath9 , which would be consistent with such a chiral abm type state .",
    "on the other hand several experiments@xcite indicate that the gap function must have lines of nodes on the fermi surface , unlike the simple abm state which is nodeless on the three cylindrical sheets , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of the fermi surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of the possible location of these line nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "we concentrate on the case of horizontal lines of nodes , because vertical nodes ( for example in f - wave pairing states ) appear to be inconsistent with the absence of angular dependence of the thermal conductivity in an a - b plane magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the presence of horizontal lines of nodes , as originally suggested by hasegawa , machida and ohmi@xcite , can not be explained in any 2-d theoretical model but requires a 3-d model with at least some component of the pairing interaction acting between planes . a number of such models assuming interlayer coupling have been proposed@xcite .",
    "the specific question which we address here is whether there are horizontal line nodes on all three fermi surface sheets , as proposed recently by koikegami , yoshida and yanagisawa@xcite , or whether the nodes are only on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 sheets , as proposed by zhitomirsky and rice@xcite and in our earlier interlayer coupling model@xcite . to answer this question",
    "we will analyze , an effective week coupling model where the attractive interactions can appear between electrons on nearest neighbour and next nearest neighbour lattice sites ( symbolised by 2 and 3 lines in fig .",
    "1 ) . we will contrast the predictions of our original interlayer coupling model@xcite with ones chosen to reproduce the gap structure proposed by koikegami , yoshida and yanagisawa@xcite .",
    "+    to describe superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , we start from the following simple multi - orbital attractive hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 label the sites of a body centred tetragonal lattice ( as shown in fig .",
    "1 ) , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to the three ruthenium @xmath18 orbitals ( as shown in fig .",
    "2 ) . in the following the orbitals will be denoted @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath22 and site energies @xmath23 were fitted to reproduce the experimentally determined three - dimensional fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "we found that the set @xmath24 given in @xcitegave a good account of the fermi surface data .    since the actual physical mechanism of pairing in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is unknown , we will adopt a phenomenological approach and treat the effective hubbard interaction constants @xmath25 as free parameters",
    "the idea is to test different `` scenarios '' for the interaction constants against the available experimental results .",
    "good agreement between experiment and theory is likely to only occur when the interaction parameters @xmath25 lead to a gap function on the fermi surface @xmath26 which is similar to that actually present in the material .",
    "in particular , both the jump in specific heat at @xmath9 , and the linear dependence of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 for line nodes ) near to @xmath29 are sensitive to the gap @xmath26 over the whole fermi surface .",
    "scenarios in which the line nodes occur on all fermi surface sheets or only on @xmath2 @xmath3 would be expected to lead to different temperature dependencies of @xmath30 , which can therefore be distinguished by comparison to the experiments .    in fig .",
    "1 we depict schematically the possible interactions @xmath25 between electrons on the same ru - atom ( shown by circle 1 ) and the neighbouring ru - atoms ( shown by lines denoted 2,3 for in - plane and out of plane interactions , respectively ) .",
    "we assume that the dominant interaction between electrons on the same site @xmath14 ( 1 ) is the strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "the effective interactions between nearest neighbours are assumed to be attractive .",
    "they could arise either from spin - fluctuation mediated exchange@xcite , or from interlayer coulomb scattering@xcite .",
    "in this paper we will compare two different model sets of interaction constants .",
    "the first is motivated by the inter - plane coulomb scattering model of koikegami , yoshida and yanagisawa@xcite .",
    "it assumes coulomb repulsion between electrons on the same and the nearest neighbour in plane lattice sites ( 1 and 2 in fig . 1 ) and attraction between ru planes ( 3 in fig .",
    "the corresponding hubbard interaction parameters are @xmath31 expressed as matrices in orbital space , @xmath16 , @xmath32 . in this model there are two attractive hubbard parameters , one acting only between @xmath33 orbitals and the other acting equally between @xmath34 and @xmath35 orbitals . in k - space there is little hybridization between the @xmath34-@xmath35 orbitals and the @xmath33 orbitals , and so these inter - plane interactions mainly corresponding to interactions within the @xmath4 band ( @xmath36 ) and within the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fermi surface sheets ( @xmath37 ) . we shall call this case scenario 1 in the rest of this paper .",
    "we wish to compare the predictions of the above set of model parameters with those of our previous inter - plane coupling model@xcite , which was motivated by the different spatial orientations of the xz , yz , xy orbitals as shown in fig .",
    "2 . given that the ru d - xy orbital ( @xmath33 ) has a mainly 2-d character we assumed that interactions between @xmath33 orbitals are mainly in - plane .",
    "on the other hand the ru d - xz ( a ) and d - yz ( b ) orbitals are oriented perpendicular to the ruo@xmath0 plane , and so we assumed that the interactions between electrons in these orbitals are mainly iner - plane .",
    "this simple reasoning leads to the following two parameter hubbard model with @xmath38 we shall refer to this as scenario 2 below .    in our earlier papers@xcite",
    "we showed that this simple model gives a good overall account of the temperature dependent heat capacity @xmath30 , in - plane superfluid density @xmath39 , and thermal conductivity .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the predictions of the model are fairly robust against the addition of extra interaction parameters or disorder .    in equations 2 and 3",
    "we have set to zero any interaction terms which are either assumed to be small , or those which may be repulsive .",
    "we have checked that all the zero values appearing in the above interaction matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( eqs .",
    "2,3 ) can be changed into small positive values representing repulsions without any change to the solution , and so we decided to use ( eqs .",
    "2,3 ) the minimal set leading to pairing .    for above choices of interactions within the negative @xmath42 extended hubbard model ( eq .",
    "1 ) , we solved the bogolubov - de gennes equations : @xmath43 together with the self - consistency condition @xmath44 which follow from eq .",
    "( 1 ) on making the usual bcs - like mean field approximation@xcite . here",
    "@xmath45 is the fermi function , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is boltzmann constant and @xmath48 enumerates the solutions of eq .",
    "[ eq : bdegequation ] .    assuming an p - wave pairing state of the form @xmath49 , on each fermi surface sheet",
    ", then we need only consider the gap parameters @xmath50 at each point in the brillouin zone .",
    "dropping the spin indices for clarity , the general structure of pairing parameter is of the general form @xmath51 for @xmath52 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 . in the present calculations we neglected the possibilities of @xmath53 pairing ( @xmath54 ) or f - wave pairing @xmath55 , for reasons which are discussed further in @xcite .",
    "+ from the two different interaction models given by eqs . 2 and 3 we numerically find the corresponding solutions of the gap equation eqs . 4 , 5 .",
    "in the case of scenario 1 , eq .",
    "2 , the gap parameters have the general form , @xmath56 for @xmath57 . while for scenario 2 ( eq .",
    "3 ) the gap parameters are @xmath58 for @xmath52 or @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "clearly scenario 1 has a order parameter for which all of the gap parameters @xmath59 vanish in the planes @xmath60 .",
    "therefore all three fermi surface sheets should have horizontal line nodes . on the other hand , in scenario 2 only the @xmath34 and @xmath35 components of @xmath59 vanish , implying that the @xmath4 sheet is nodeless .    the temperature dependence of the order parameters in each scenario are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in our analysis",
    "we have fitted the interaction parameters ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) to obtain a single critical temperature @xmath64k for all order parameter components ( fig .",
    "note , the differences between @xmath62 and @xmath63 arises as an effect of the difference in partial density of states for the bands @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in case of @xmath4",
    "the fermi surface is close to a van hove singularity @xcite , and so @xmath36 can be smaller while still obtaining the same @xmath9 . on the other hand , the larger value of @xmath65 can be explained by the out of plane spatial orientation of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 ru orbitals , compared to the in plane ru d - xy orientation of @xmath33 orbital    the angular dependence of the eigenvalues @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 on the corresponding @xmath69 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 fermi surface sheets , plotted along the @xmath70 axis , are shown in fig .",
    "4 . in case of the inter - plane attraction",
    "only scenario 1 the gap has line nodes on all three fermi surface sheets . in contrast , in scenario 2 the gap is nodeless on the @xmath4 sheet , as can be seen in fig 4(d ) .",
    "now the key question is whether experiment can distinguish between these two gap scenarios , namely line nodes on all fermi surface sheets compared to just nodes on @xmath2 @xmath3 only .",
    "we calculated the specific heat for those solutions via the following relation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the fermi function .",
    "the results are presented in fig . 5 and compared to the experimental values of nishizaki _ et al._@xcite .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "5 that the slope of @xmath27 near to @xmath29 is slightly higher for scenario 1 compared to scenario 2 , consistent with the  extra  line node on the @xmath4 fermi surface sheet . however the change in slope is quite small , and so one can say that either model is consistent with the low temperature experimental data .    on the other hand , in fig .",
    "5 it is clear that the second solution 2 works slightly better for the jump of specific heat at critical temperature @xmath9 .",
    "solution 1 has a smaller fermi surface average of @xmath73 , and this leads to the slightly smaller jump in specific heat at @xmath9 .",
    "the close similarity of curves 1 and 2 can be understood if one notices that the quite different gap symmetry on the @xmath4 sheet can lead to rather similar results after integration over the fermi surface ( eq .",
    "10 ) .    as a further test of the presence of horizontal line nodes on all fermi surface sheets",
    ", we have also calculated the in - plane superfluid density @xmath39 using @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the temperature dependent penetration depth , @xmath76 or @xmath77 is the in plane band velocity at @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the electron charge , @xmath80 is the magnetic constant , @xmath81 is the electron band energy and @xmath82    both secenarios 1 and 2 give similar results of @xmath83 and agree with experimental results by bonalde _",
    "et al._@xcite ( gray squares ) .",
    "however , one can note that the slightly different slope in small temperature regions gives a slight advantage to solution 2 which mimics the experimental data a little better .",
    "+ we have tested two different gap models for strontium ruthenate , which are consistent with two physically different pairing mechanisms . in scenario 1 , we assumed that all in - plane interactions are repulsive , and that only the out of plane interactions lead to pairing .",
    "this is motivated by the coulomb scattering pairing mechanism of koikegami , yoshida and yanagisawa@xcite . in scenario",
    "2 we assumed attractive in - plane interactions for ru @xmath84 orbitals ( @xmath4 band ) and attractive inter - plane interactions of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 orbitals ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands ) .",
    "surprisingly we found that the predicted specific heat is very similar in both models ( fig .",
    "5 ) , even though one has a horizontal line node on all three fermi surface sheets while the other has a nodeless @xmath4 sheet .",
    "similarly the temperature dependent superfuid density is closer to experiment in both scenarios .",
    "of these two models the nodeless @xmath4 sheet appears to be slightly close to the experiment , but the actual differences are small .    in these calculations",
    "we have not attempted to include the interband proximity effect proposed by zhitomirsky and rice@xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed that this corresponds in real - space to the addition of three - site hubbard interaction parameters , or assisted hopping , to the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "it would be quite possible to combine this interband proximity effect interaction with either of the two pairing scenarios which we have considered here .",
    "however the close similarity of the specific heat and superfluid density in the two models , shown in figs . 5",
    ", 6 strongly suggests that the effect of the proximity coupling terms would also be very similar in either pairing model .",
