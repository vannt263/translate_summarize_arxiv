    "in recent years a series of experimental results at rhic @xcite , tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite demonstrated that the study of photon - induced interactions in hadronic colliders is feasible and can be used to probe e.g. the nuclear gluon distribution @xcite , the dynamics of the strong interactions @xcite and the mechanism of quarkonium production @xcite .",
    "it has stimulated the improvement of the theoretical description of these processes as well as the proposal of new forward detectors to be installed in the lhc .",
    "the basic idea in the photon - induced processes is that a ultra relativistic charged hadron ( proton or nuclei ) give rise to strong electromagnetic fields , such that the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron ( photon - photon process ) or can interact directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) @xcite . in these processes",
    "the total cross section can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons into the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section .",
    "consequently , a basic ingredient in the analysis of the photon - induced processes is the description of the equivalent photon distribution of the hadron .",
    "the equivalent photon approximation of a charged pointlike fermion was formulated many years ago by fermi @xcite and developed by williams @xcite and weizsacker @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the calculation of the photon distribution of the hadrons still is a subject of debate , due to the fact that they are not point like particles . in this case",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between the elastic and inelastic components ( see fig .",
    "[ diagrama_flux ] ) . the elastic component [ fig .",
    "[ diagrama_flux ] ( a ) ] can be estimated analysing the transition @xmath4 taking into account the effects of the hadronic form factors , with the hadron remaining intact in the final state @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the inelastic contribution [ fig .",
    "[ diagrama_flux ] ( b ) ] is associated to the transition @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , and can be estimated taking into account the partonic structure of the hadrons , which can be a source of photons ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "therefore the total photon distribution of a hadron is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fraction of the hadron energy carried by the photon and @xmath9 has to be identified with a momentum scale of the photon - induced process .",
    "it is important to emphasize that while @xmath10 is proportional to squared charge of the hadron ( @xmath11 ) , due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , @xmath12 is proportional to the mass number @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , for a heavy nuclei , the total photon distribution is determined by its elastic component .",
    "in contrast , for a proton , both components contribute equally and should be taking into account in the study of photon - induced processes .",
    "currently , the description of the inelastic component still is an open question , with the predictions for its @xmath8 dependence being largely distinct , as we will demonstrate in the next section .",
    "our goal in this paper is twofold : ( a ) analyse the impact of the inelastic component in the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons ( @xmath14 and @xmath3 ) in @xmath0 collisions at lhc , and ( b ) verify if a more detailed analysis of this process can be used to constrain the inelastic component of the photon distribution .

    "we briefly review the description of the elastic and inelastic components of the photon distribution of a nucleon .",

    "we discuss the diffractive photoproduction in @xmath0 collisions and the main input used in our calculations . in section [ res ]",
    "we present our results for the @xmath15 and @xmath3 production considering the different models for the inelastic component of the photon distribution and compare with those obtained considering the elastic component .",
    "finally , in section [ sum ] , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the concept of the photon content of a charged fermion is based on the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite , which implies that the photon distribution of a nucleon consist of two parts : the elastic and inelastic components .",
    "a detailed derivation of the elastic photon distribution of a nucleon was presented in ref .",

    "@xcite , a naive approach to the photon flux was proposed , with the photon distribution in the proton being given by a convolution of the distribution of quarks in the proton and the distribution of photons in the quarks as follows @xmath28 where the sum runs over all quark and antiquark flavours and the flux of photons in a quark @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 being assumed to be the maximum value of the momentum transfer in the process and @xmath32 is assumed to be equal to 1 gev@xmath33 in order to the parton model to be applicable .",
    "recently , different groups have studied the modification of the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi equations for the quark and gluon distributions by the inclusion of qed contributions and have performed global parton analysis of deep inelastic and related hard - scattering data @xcite . basically , the dglap equations and the momentum sum rule are modified considering the presence of the photon as an additional point - like parton in the nucleon .",
    "the parametrizations for the photon distribution currently available in the literature @xcite differ in the approach for the initial condition for the photon distribution . while the mrst group assume that @xmath34 is given by a expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ naive ] ) , the nnpdf group parametrize the input photon pdf and attempt to determine the parameters from the global data . the preliminary cteq analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite assume a similar theoretical form for @xmath34 to that proposed by the mrst group , but with an arbitrary normalization parameter , which is expressed as the momentum fraction carried by the photon .",
    "more recently , a distinct approach for the initial condition for the evolution of the photon distribution was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors have proposed that the starting distribution for the photon pdf should be the total photon distribution , i.e. by the sum of the elastic and inelastic components as given in eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) .",
    "the main motivation of this approach is the reduced uncertainty in the input photon pdf , since the major part of the distribution is given by the elastic component , which is well known .",
    "as a consequence of this assumption , the elastic component is dominant also at large values of the hard scale @xmath35 ( see fig . 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the current data is not sufficient accurate to precisely determine the initial condition .",
    "thus the current predictions for the inelastic photon component strongly differ in its @xmath8 dependence . in what follows",
    "we will consider the mrst2004qed and nnpdf parametrizations , since only these two are currently available to public use . in fig .",
    "[ ineflux ] we present the predictions of the mrst2004qed and nnpdf parametrizations for the inelastic photon distribution considering two different values for the hard scale @xmath35 . for comparison the predictions of the naive approach [ eq .",
    "( [ naive ] ) ] and the elastic component [ eq .",
    "( [ dz ] ) ] are also presented .",
    "while the elastic component is independent of the hard scale @xmath35 , the inelastic component is strongly dependent , increasing at larger values of @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , all models predict that the inelastic contribution is dominant at very small values of @xmath8",
    ". however , as demonstrated in the figure , the @xmath8-dependence of the inelastic parametrizations is very distinct .",
    "this result motivates the analysis of observables which are strongly dependent on the photon flux .",
    "the basic idea for the description of the diffractive quarkonium photoproduction in @xmath0 collisions is that the total cross section can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - target production cross section as follows @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 represents a rapidity gap in the final state and @xmath39 or @xmath40 depending if the incident proton which emits the photon remains intact or dissociate .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 is the rapidity distribution for the photon - target interaction induced by the hadron @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , which can be expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the equivalent photon flux associated to the hadron @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the c.m.s energy squared of the photon - hadron system , @xmath48 is the photon energy and @xmath49 is the c.m.s energy squared of the hadron - hadron system .",
    "+     since the pioneering studies @xcite on diffractive vector meson production in ultra peripheral heavy ion collisions ( uphic ) about fourteen years ago , a large number of papers on the subject has been published considering several improvements in the theoretical description @xcite and experimental analysis @xcite .",

    "( [ dsigdy2 ] ) peaks at positive rapidities while the second term peaks at negative rapidities .",
    "consequently , the study of the rapidity distribution can be used to constrain the equivalent photon distribution .",

    ", the choice of this scale is a bit ambiguous @xcite . in general it is assumed that it is related to the center - of - mass energy of the photon - induced subprocess or to a hard scale in the final state .",
