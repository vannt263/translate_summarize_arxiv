    "the density of states ( dos ) of a bulk s - wave superconductor exhibits a quasi - particle energy gap and a singularity at the gap edge .",
    "while the gap is robust with respect to the addition of non - magnetic impurities ( anderson theorem  @xcite ) , the integrity of the gap is destroyed by the pair - breaking effect of time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbations  @xcite , e.g.  magnetic impurities  @xcite , and parallel magnetic fields in thin films  @xcite .",
    "( for a general review see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a second , and more direct way of influencing the integrity of the gap is through the imposition of quenched spatial fluctuations of the superconducting coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "physically , such inhomogeneities can be induced by dislocations , twin or grain boundaries , or compositional heterogeneity as found in superconducting alloys  @xcite . in these cases , fluctuations in the superconducting coupling constant are reflected in inhomogeneities of the order parameter which , in turn , induce a smearing of the quasi - particle energy gap .    in all of the cases described above , the mechanism by which the quasi - particle energy gap is suppressed follows a similar scheme and is described by the same phenomenology : at the mean - field level , each of the perturbations above lead to a suppression of the quasi - particle gap edge .",
    "the form of this suppression is contained within the abrikosov - gorkov theory  @xcite which describes the rearrangement of the ground state under the constraints imposed by the self - consistency equation .",
    "while the physical mechanisms of gap suppression differ , the mean - field equations depend on a single dimensionless parameter characterising the strength of the external perturbation ( see below ) . even at the mean - field level , it is found that if the perturbation is strong enough , the system is driven into a homogeneous gapless phase before the superconductivity is ultimately destroyed .",
    "after the pioneering work of abrikosov and gorkov  @xcite ( originally formulated in the context of magnetic impurities in the dirty superconductor ) , it was realised that the integrity of the gapped phase is compromised even if the perturbation is weak  @xcite .",
    "optimal fluctuations of the random impurity potentials can conspire to create quasi - particle states localised on the length scale of the coherence length  @xmath0 at energies below the mean - field gap , i.e.  in the presence of disorder , the system fragments into an inhomogeneous phase in which ` droplets ' of localised sub - gap states are embedded in the superconducting background .",
    "a similar scenario arises in proximity coupled systems , i.e.  sn hybrid structures , where the superconductor induces a gap in the normal region  @xcite . in the most recent investigation",
    ", it was shown  @xcite that , close to the mean - field energy gap edge  @xmath1 , the nature of the quasi - particle states ( their structure and spectral density ) are universal , depending only on the relative separation from the edge , the dimensionality , and the single dimensionless parameter characterising the strength of the perturbation .    on this background",
    ", we consider below the influence of a spatially varying coupling constant  @xmath2 on the quasi - particle properties of a conventional disordered @xmath3-wave superconductor .",
    "as mentioned above , such a program is not new : the same problem was investigated in an earlier work by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite . however , although our aims , and indeed many of our conclusions , are broadly similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , this investigation is motivated by two considerations : firstly , the development of a quasi - classical approach within the framework of the non - linear @xmath4-model ( nl@xmath4 m ) to explore the nature of the quasi - particle states in the ` sub - gap ' region serves as a useful prototype for future studies of related ` droplet phase ' instabilities in other interacting theories such as that presented by the superconductor / insulator transition in the disordered interacting system  @xcite .",
    "secondly , in developing and applying the @xmath4-model approach , we will find that the lifshitz - type arguments  @xcite invoked in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the profile of the dos in the sub - gap region are flawed .",
    "indeed , the theory developed below will expose a general scheme which establishes the universality of ` gap fluctuations ' in the @xmath5-dimensional system ( and which is in accord with the zero - dimensional results of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    with this introduction ,",
    "let us formulate the model superconducting system which we will consider .",
    "our starting point is the gorkov or bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian @xmath6 where the subscript ` @xmath7 ' refers to the particle / hole space and @xmath8 .",
    "here , @xmath9 denotes the fermi energy and @xmath10 represents a quenched random impurity potential whose distribution is characterised by the mean scattering time  @xmath11 . for simplicity , we consider the potential to be drawn from a gaussian white noise distribution , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the average dos of the normal system .",
    "the order parameter ( chosen to be real ) has to be determined self - consistently from the condition @xmath14 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will assume that the ( inverse ) coupling constant  @xmath15 exhibits small fluctuations around an average value  @xmath16 .",
    "as with the random impurity potential , these fluctuations of the coupling constant @xmath17 are drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean , and correlation @xmath18 ( our specific choice of notation being borrowed from ref .",
    "here we will impose the condition @xmath19 so that the coupling constant remains positive everywhere .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the correlations are characterised by some correlation length  @xmath20 which determines the range of @xmath21 .",
    "qualitatively , the response of the ground state to inhomogeneities in the coupling constant depends sensitively on the range of the correlations .",
    "if the correlation length  @xmath20 is much larger than the superconducting coherence length @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 diffusion constant ) , then , the order parameter can smoothly adjust to the local value of @xmath15 . in this case @xmath24 , and the local dos , @xmath25 , is fixed by the local value of the order parameter  @xcite . in the opposite limit , one expects the faster fluctuations of the coupling constant to be rectified by the ` proximity effect ' coupling of neighbouring superconducting regions .",
    "it is in this limit that the system becomes sensitive to quasi - classical phase coherence processes .",
    "therefore , to focus our discussion , in the following , we limit consideration to the quasi - classical and dirty limits , where the energy scales are arranged in the hierarchy @xmath26    before turning to the formalism , let us summarise the main conclusions of this investigation .",
    "firstly , as anticipated by ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that inhomogeneities of the coupling constant are reflected in inhomogeneities of the superconducting order parameter . setting @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents the homogeneous component of the order parameter and @xmath29 its spatial fluctuation",
    ", one finds that @xmath30 here @xmath31 represents a dimensionless function which is determined self - consistently ( see below ) .",
    "now , if the correlation length of the coupling constant is short as compared to the coherence length , @xmath32 , one finds  @xcite that the equation of motion for the average quasi - particle green function obeys a local non - linear equation which has the canonical form obtained in the theory of gapless superconductivity by abrikosov and gorkov  @xcite .",
    "specifically , in the mean - field approximation , the bcs singularity is rounded off , and the dos exhibits a reduced quasi - particle energy gap  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a dimensionless parameter characterising the strength of the correlations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "note that , in the present case , the conditions @xmath35 ( i.e.  @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 imply that @xmath38 .",
    "thus , as one would expect , if the coupling constant remains positive everywhere , the system remains in the gapped phase .",
    "however , the conclusions of the mean - field analysis are modified significantly by optimal fluctuations of the random impurity potential . such fluctuations , which appear as spatially inhomogeneous instanton configurations of the mean - field equation , show the gap structure to be fragile : mesoscopic fluctuations generate spatially localised states at energies below the mean - field gap .",
    "close to the mean - field gap edge  @xmath1 , these states are confined to droplets of size  @xcite @xmath39 diverging as @xmath40 approaches @xmath1 . since @xmath41",
    ", each of these regions is characterised by an entire band of localised states confined to each droplet . to exponential accuracy",
    "the corresponding sub - gap dos varies as @xmath42\\ ! , \\label{dos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 represents a known dimensionless function of the control parameter  @xmath44 .",
    "this result , which is non - perturbative in the dimensionless conductance of the normal system @xmath45 , differs from that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite but , instead , mirrors the scaling obtained in the study of sub - gap states in superconductors with magnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "later we will argue that the energy scaling of the dos is not accidental but is a universal feature of the sub - gap states in the superconducting system ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath46 , the system enters a zero - dimensional regime . here",
    "the expression for the dos ( [ dos ] ) applies with @xmath47 .",
    "reassuringly , this result is found to be in accord with the exact universal result predicted for zero - dimensional models which exhibit a square root singularity at the level of mean - field  @xcite .",
    "( the origin of this universality in the present scheme was discussed in ref .",

    "[ sec2 ] we formulate the quantum partition function of the disordered superconductor in the framework of a replica field theory . in the dirty limit , we show that the low - energy properties of the bulk superconducting system is contained within a non - linear @xmath4-model action .",

    "[ subsec - mf ] .    in higher dimensions",
    "one can assume that the bounce solution possesses radial symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , the problem becomes more complicated because the saddle - point equation contains a gradient term  @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",

    "although this completes our analysis of the profile and statistical weight of the bounce solution , since it does not depart from the line @xmath162=\\pi/2 $ ] , taken alone , it provides no contribution to the dos ! to understand why sub - gap states are associated with the bounce it is necessary to explore the role of fluctuations in the vicinity of the instanton . as emphasised in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a program turns out to be crucial in the present system .",
    "as we have seen , the lowest energy bounce configuration involves a breaking of replica symmetry at the level of the mean - field .",
    "taking into account fluctuations in the vicinity of the bounce solution , we will see below that there exists a zero - mode and a negative energy mode .",
    "the former restores global replica symmetry of the theory and , thus , ensures the integrity of the normalisation of the generating functional @xmath180 .",
    "furthermore , the negative energy mode necessitates a @xmath159 rotation of the contour which , imparting a factor of @xmath181 , renders the contribution of the instanton to the dos non - vanishing .    to explore the influence of the fluctuations ,",
    "let us return to the quasi one - dimensional system and introduce the parameterisation @xmath182 where @xmath183 $ ] is the rotation from the metallic saddle point to the inhomogeneous saddle point  @xmath184 .",
    "the matrices  @xmath185 are subject to the symmetry condition in replica space @xmath186 .",

    "there are two types of fluctuation :    \\(a ) replica - diagonal fluctuations , and    \\(b ) fluctuations mixing the replicas .    within the replica - diagonal part ,",
    "the most relevant contributions are due to fluctuations of the angle  @xmath21 , i.e.  @xmath189 . in the @xmath190 ` trivial ' replicas ( @xmath191 ) , these fluctuations are massive and , therefore , only lead to a weakly energy dependent prefactor .",
    "more important are the fluctuations which stay within the symmetry broken replica @xmath164 : @xmath192={1\\over 2}\\int dx \\int dx'\\,\\varphi_1(x)\\,\\frac{\\delta^2s } { \\delta\\phi(x)\\delta\\phi(x')}\\,\\varphi_1(x')\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now this class of fluctuations has been studied extensively in the standard literature  @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath193 has a zero - mode , @xmath194 , due to translational invariance , i.e.  the action is independent of the position of the bounce .",
    "furthermore , as the zero - mode is associated with a _ bounce _ solution it has a node .",
    "this implies the existence of one negative energy eigen mode . to account for this",
    ", one has to rotate the contour away from the imaginary axis .",
    "this deformation of the contour provides a factor of @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the result  which was purely imaginary ( @xmath162=\\pi/2 $ ] ) before  becomes real and , thus , gives a finite contribution to the dos .",
    "turning to the fluctuations mixing the replicas , the replica symmetry breaking must be accompanied by a zero - mode in replica space .",
    "writing @xmath195 , where @xmath196 ( anti-)commutes with @xmath197 , the part of the action involving the coupling between the replicas ` 1 ' and ` @xmath198 ' reads @xmath199\\!-\\!\\widetilde v^\\pm}2\\ ,   w^\\pm_{1a}w^\\pm_{a1}\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath200    although its presence is disguised by the choice of parameterisation , the action involving this class of fluctuations exhibits a zero - mode .",
    "indeed , its existence is made manifest by specifying the parameterisation @xmath201 .",
    "however , with this choice , the measure associated with the fluctuations becomes highly non - trivial .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful for determining the dependence of the integration over zero - modes on the number of replicas , @xmath202 .",
    "close to the gap edge , i.e.  at finite energies @xmath203 , the structure of the saddle point within the @xmath204- and @xmath205-space is completely fixed .",
    " the only freedom left are rotations in replica space , @xmath206 .",
    "thus , dividing off the matrices which leave the saddle point invariant , the relevant matrices @xmath207 belong to the coset space u(@xmath202)/(u(1)@xmath208u(@xmath209 ) ) .",
    "integration over the zero - mode gives a factor which is proportional to the volume @xmath210 in the limit @xmath163  @xcite . or",
    ", in other words , there are @xmath202 saddle points that contribute to the integral .",
    "using the parameterisation  ( [ par - fluct ] ) does not change the @xmath202 dependence but only the spatial structure of the zero - mode .",
    "therefore , without calculating the value of the prefactor , we know that the result has the following form : @xmath211\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\times|\\chi_0(x)|^2\\,e^{-s_{\\rm inst.}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\int\\ !",
    "dx\\,\\left[\\sinh\\phi(x)-\\sinh\\phi_{\\sc ag}\\right]|\\chi_0(x)|^2 \\,e^{-s_{\\rm inst.}}\\ , , \\label{zero - rep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath212 describes the spatial profile of the zero - mode .",
    "this concludes our derivation of the sub - gap dos : by itself the instanton or bounce configuration provides the leading exponential dependence of the dos while the fluctuations render the pre - exponential factors positive definite .",
    "more precisely ,    \\(1 ) the prefactor becomes real due to the negative energy eigen mode and the consequential deformation of the contour ;    \\(2 ) the sub - gap dos is non - vanishing only in the vicinity of the bounce as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ zero - rep ] ) .    altogether , taking the expression for the action in the @xmath5-dimensional system  ( [ sinst ] ) , we obtain the expression for the dos defined by eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) .",
    "a further rescaling of the dos allows an explicit connection between the general expression and its universal zero - dimensional limit : to this end , let us introduce the parameter @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the average level spacing of the normal system , after which the mean - field dos in the vicinity of the energy gap can be cast in the form  @xcite @xmath215 then , making use of eqs .",
    "( [ delta - g ] ) and ( [ r - drop ] ) , the dos can be brought to the more compact form @xmath216 where @xmath217 and @xmath218 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ r - drop ] ) .",
    "indeed , the factor @xmath219 can be further absorbed into @xmath220 by replacing the level spacing of the system , @xmath221 , with the level spacing of the droplet , @xmath222 , in its definition  ( [ delta - g ] ) .",
    "now , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the mean - field dos exhibits a square - root singularity of the form  ( [ dossqrt ] ) , fluctuations of the edge due to optimal fluctuations of the impurity potential are predicted to assume a universal form @xmath223 \\label{dosuniversal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obtained by random matrix theory .",
    "now , as we have seen , when @xmath46 ( inevitable as @xmath224 ) , the system enters a zero - dimensional regime . in this limit , with @xmath47 the expression for the dos reassuringly assumes the universal form ( [ dosuniversal ] ) .    in the present context ,",
    "the mechanism by which the universal expression develops at the level of the action has been elucidated in ref .",
    "specifically , in the zero - dimensional regime , the instanton configuration must be supplemented by a homogeneous replica symmetry broken solution of stationary phase which sits at the shallow minimum of the potential  @xmath225 , c.f .",
    "[ potential ] .",
    "there the integration contour leaves the axis @xmath152 , and the minimum represents in fact a maximum along the perpendicular direction  @xcite .",
    "physically , gap fluctuations in the zero - dimensional system correspond to sample - to - sample fluctuations rather than spatial variations of the gap .",
    "although the saddle - point analysis as well as the size of the instanton agree with the result found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy dependence of the action does not , i.e.  while we obtain the exponent @xmath226 , the solution obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is compatible with an exponent @xmath227 . as mentioned above the exponent @xmath228",
    "can be traced back to the zero - dimensional case , where the form of the action is universal  @xcite , i.e.  this exponent is a direct consequence of the square root behaviour of the mean - field result .",
    "in fact , the discrepancy of the results can be traced to the application of a lifshitz - type argument  @xcite to the present scheme .",
    "indeed , although the problem bears close similarity to the lifshitz problem of band tail states in semiconductors  @xcite , the correspondence is superficial . in particular",
    ", lifshitz tails states at the band - edge of a semiconductor are typically associated with wavefunctions which vary smoothly on the scale of their extent . as such",
    ", an estimate of the optimal character of the tail state distribution can be established on the level of the @xmath229-field action .",
    "by contrast , the sub - gap tail states associated with gap fluctuations in the superconducting system involve a superposition of states close to the fermi level , where spatial fluctuations vary rapidly oscillating at the scale of the fermi wavelength  the sub - gap states are quasi - classical in origin .",
    "it therefore does not seem possible to develop a lifshitz argument for the present system . as a further consequence , in contrast to the band - tail states , the quasi - classical nature of the sub - gap states in the superconductor make their properties insensitive to the nature of the impurity distribution .",
    "in summary , following the work of larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite , we have shown that , in a weakly disordered superconductor , short - scale fluctuations of the bcs coupling constant lead to a suppression of the quasi - particle energy gap . at the level of mean - field , the integrity of the gap edge is maintained .",
    "however , optimal fluctuations of the impurity potential induce a narrow band of states , localised at the scale of the coherence length , which extend below the mean - field gap edge . within the framework of the statistical field theory developed here ,",
    "these states appear as replica symmetry broken instanton configurations of the mean - field equations  the global symmetry of the theory being restored by a zero - mode in the replica space . to exponential accuracy",
    ", we have obtained the spectrum of gap fluctuations .",
    "the generality of these results has been emphasised .",
    "specifically , in the @xmath5-dimensional system , once normalised by the mean - field dos at the gap edge , we have shown that the spectrum of tails states depends only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 and , in particular , is independent of the nature of the disorder potential . moreover , in the zero - dimensional system , the spectrum of gap fluctuations is truly universal and coincides with that obtained by vavilov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the study of gap fluctuations in the sn system .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the analysis in this work has a number of relatives in the recent literature . as we have emphasised , at the level of the soft mode action , the theory of gap fluctuations mirrors that obtained in the abrikosov - gorkov theory of a superconductor with magnetic impurities  @xcite and , later , that encountered in the description of sub - gap states in the hybrid sn system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , various results non - perturbative in the ( inverse ) dimensionless conductance and involving replica ( or super-)symmetry breaking have been reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "of these investigations , it is particularly interesting to contrast the present scheme with the prediction of ` anomalously localised states ' in the weakly disordered normal conductor .    by exploiting instanton configurations of the non - linear @xmath4-model action , khmelnitskii and muzykantskii",
    "@xcite proposed that the long - time current relaxation in a disordered wire was dominated by rare localised states which coexist in a background of extended states ( see also , ref .",
    "these states , which are ascribed to optimal fluctuations of the random potential , are penalised by a statistical weight which depends exponentially on the dimensionless conductance .",
    "this scaling mirrors that found in the present system .",
    "however , crucially , scaling in the superconducting system involves an energy dependence which allows the exponent to become small as one approaches the energy gap .    in hindsight , it is easy to understand why optimal fluctuations can more readily induce localised states in the superconducting system . in the normal disordered system , as pointed out by mott , hybridisation makes the coexistence of localised states in a background of extended states difficult to sustain .",
    "however , in the superconducting system , fluctuations of the order parameter provide a natural mechanism by which quasi - particle states can localise in regions where the order parameter is suppressed .",
