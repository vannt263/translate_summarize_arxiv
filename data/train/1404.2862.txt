    "this paper introduces a diagrammatic formalism for computation and for information processing . behind this endeavor",
    "is the observation that the combinatorial properties of knot diagrams mimic principles pertaining to conservation and to manipulation of information in networks .",
    "our approach is low - dimensional topological , whereas previous diagrammatic descriptions of information flow in networks have been in terms of labeled graphs .     a tangle machine with colours suppressed.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "we construct diagrammatic models called _ tangle machines _ , or just _ machines _ for short , represented by labeled versions of diagrams such as those of figure  [ f : machine ] , that represent entities and relationships between those entities . unlike labeled graphs , in which edge @xmath0 from vertex @xmath1 to vertex @xmath2 represents a transition from the label of @xmath1 to the label of @xmath2 , the basic building block of a tangle machine",
    "is an _ interaction _ , in which _ agent _ @xmath3 causes a transition from colours of _ input patients _",
    "@xmath4 to colours of corresponding _ output patients _ @xmath5 .",
    "a tangle machine ( which we call a _ machine _ for short ) makes explicit the _ cause _ of a transition . from one perspective",
    ", a machine is a computational scheme , a sort of `` planar algorithm '' wherein interactions represent basic computations . from the dual perspective ,",
    "a machine is a network within which information is manipulated at interactions and then transmitted further down to registers at other interactions .",
    "information can be both a patient ( _ e.g. _ an input data stream ) and an agent ( _ e.g. _ commands of a computer programme ) .",
    "this aspect of information is captured by tangle machines but not necessarily by labeled graphs .",
    "the novel feature of tangle machines is their flexibility . whereas competing graphical models are rigid",
    ", tangle machines admit a natural local notion of _ equivalence_. roughly speaking , two machines are equivalent if one can be perfectly reproduced from the other .",
    "machine equivalence parallels the notion of _ ambient isotopy _ in low dimensional topology .",
    "we consider a ` crossing ' ( which we call an _ interaction _ ) to represent a computation ( in the sense of computer science or of automata ) or a fusion of information whose basic symmetries are encapsulated by the three _",
    "reidemeister moves _ of figure  [ f : local_moves_machines1 ] in section  [ s : machines][ss : equivalence ] .",
    "topology suggests that these three local rewrite moves are in a sense different aspects of a single operation consisting of rotating a plane onto which an embedded object is projected .",
    "local features such as implementation and performance of computations or of information manipulations modeled by the tangle machine may be different for networks modeled by equivalent machines , but we consider the global _ information content _ of such networks to be the same .",
    "we may thus use the tangle machine formalism to select , from among many equivalent models which ` perform the same task ' , the model ( and thus the network ) best suited for a specified application .",
    "this concept is illustrated in our examples :    * machines representing networks of distributed information processing ( section  [ s : information ] ) .",
    "* machines representing adiabatic quantum computations ( section  [ s : aqc ] ) .",
    "* machines representing iteration and markov chains ( section  [ s : recursion ] ) .    all of the examples make use of the tautological fact that colours of endpoints are _ machine invariants_. in each example , in order to illustrate the operational meaning of machine equivalence , three equivalent machines with different local features are examined .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the introduction",
    "we give a toy example roughly explaining what a tangle machine is , followed by a summary of our examples . in section  [ ss : context ] we discuss several aspects of how tangle machines fit into a wider scientific context . in section  [ s : machines ] we define tangle machines and tangle machine equivalence , deferring technical details to the appendix .",
    "following this are our examples , which can be read independently from one another , followed by the conclusion .      to give some idea of the sorts of things that tangle machines can be useful for , consider the following toy example.three transmitting devices @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 continuously stream data @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . our task is to combine these data streams , eliminating redundancy ( _ e.g. _ because of the problem of double counting @xcite ) .",
    "two schemes to combine the data streams are represented by the machines in figure  [ f : toy ] .",
    "[ c]@xmath10 [ c]@xmath9 [ c]@xmath11 [ c]@xmath12 [ c]@xmath13 [ l]@xmath14 [ r]@xmath15 [ l]@xmath16 [ r]@xmath17 [ r]@xmath18   two equivalent data stream fusion networks described by two equivalent tangle machines.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in the left machine , combine @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 to obtain fused data streams @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we indicate that these two fusions are performed independently by thickening the strand labeled @xmath11 .",
    "we read the fusion from bottom to top because the overcrossing arc is directed from left to right .",
    "if it were oriented from right to left , we would read from top to bottom and we would be filtering out the data stream @xmath11 from @xmath19 and from @xmath20 . at the top , @xmath19 is combined with @xmath20 using a possibly different operation @xmath13 to combine the data streams .",
    "the left and the right machine describe equivalent data stream fusion schemes , which is visually indicated by the fact that they are related by sliding one overcrossing arc over another .",
    "indeed , the result of the data stream fusion in the right machine is @xmath21 , which is the same combined data stream as in the left machine because redundant double  appearance of @xmath11 in @xmath19 and @xmath20 is eliminated by @xmath13 .",
    "this redundancy elimination is possible only because we know that @xmath6 and @xmath7 independently fused their data streams with @xmath8 .",
    "however , there is an important difference between these two schemes in figure  [ f : toy ] .",
    "imagine that , at some time @xmath22 , device @xmath7 becomes faulty .",
    "in this case , the left machine is superior because it contains the intermediate data stream @xmath19 which might be useful even when @xmath23 is junk .",
    "conversely , if @xmath8 becomes faulty at some time @xmath24 , then the right machine would be preferred .",
    "the top overcrossing arc might slide back and forth at different times .",
    "thus , the machines in our toy example might be describing the underlying logic of a simple self - optimizing fault - tolerant data stream fusion network .",
    "these ideas will recur in various contexts throughout the paper :    1 .",
    "reversibility and redundancy elimination hardwired into the formalism ( see section  [ s : machines][ss : quandle ] ) .",
    "hardwired independence ( the thickened overcrossing arc ) of updates .",
    "independent updates commute , as expressed by the @xmath25 move of figure  [ f : local_moves_machines ] in section  [ s : machines][ss : equivalence ] .",
    "3 .   local directionality ( direction of the thickened arc ) but no global ` time line ' within the machine .",
    "4 .   a flexible setup in which equivalent machines have different performance features .",
    "classical information : :    the machines of section  [ s : information ] , whose arcs are coloured by    entropies , represent distributed information processing .",
    "the    difference between input and output entropies represents the capacity    of the computation , and the computation is said to be _ optimal _ if    this number equals the mutual information of the input and the output .",
    "we exhibit three equivalent machines which represent computations with    are locally optimal , locally suboptimal , and abstract .",
    "this paradigm ,    which we plan to study further in the future , takes the formalism of    tangle machines into the realm of information theory .",
    "adiabatic quantum computation : :    section  [ s : aqc ] discusses how machines can represent networks of    adiabatic quantum computations , and presents equivalent machines which    perform the same computations , but with different energy gaps .",
    "iteration : :    by concatenating copies of the same machine one beside the other ,    machines may represent iterative computations and markov chains .",
    "we    exhibit three machines , one of which has a stochastic transition    matrix , and two of which of which have a stochastic two - step    transition matrix but not a one - step transition matrix .",
    "one of these    represents a feed - forward system , while the other represents a    feedback loop .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ s : recursion ] .",
    "the authors thank louis kauffman and marius buliga for useful comments .",
    "dm thanks also dror bar - natan for useful suggestions .",
    "the idea to model computations using tangle diagrams and related structures from low dimensional topology was pioneered by louis kauffman .",
    "motivated by spencer  brown s _ laws of form _",
    "@xcite , kauffman used knot and tangle diagrams to study automata @xcite , nonstandard set theory , and lambda calculus @xcite .",
    "the diagrammatic calculus of braids ( braids are a special class of tangles ) also lies at the basis of topological quantum computing see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "buliga has suggested to represent computations using a calculus of coloured tangles @xcite . in another direction ,",
    "a different diagrammatic calculus , originating in higher category theory , has been used in the theory of quantum information see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "we would argue that our approach is conceptually distinct from all previous approaches for the following reasons .",
    "first , on the practical level , we have not yet found direct overlap between our applications and the applications of other low - dimensional topological approaches to computation we do not know how we might describe _",
    "e.g. _ physical motion of anyons , nor do we know how previous diagrammatic approaches could naturally describe any of our examples . secondly , tangle machines place primary emphasis on a distributive property of computation and of information fusion ( compare  @xcite ) via the r3 move of figure  [ f : local_moves_machines1 ] in section  [ f : machine][ss : equivalence ] , as opposed to other approaches in which the lead role is played by associativity of a ` stacking ' operation .",
    "thirdly , in contrast with most other approaches , tangle machines are coloured .",
    "colours of registers represent information and are a fundamental part of our structure .",
    "interactions are coloured by binary operations representing fusion or computation schemes , which may differ for different interactions .",
    "a fourth difference is that our interactions can not be merged or split , so that we can graphically represent independence or indistinguishability of operations , which could not be deduced from the colours alone .",
    "a fifth difference is that only our overstrands are oriented and that their orientations are independent of one another .",
    "thus there is no global time line and directionality is localized at crossings .",
    "for these reasons we do not believe that it is possible to usefully reformulate tangle machines in , for instance , the language of braided monoidal categories , that is the language of categorical quantum mechanics .",
    "the combinatorial paradigm of knot theory manifests a new philosophy of what constitutes _ algebra _",
    "for the combinatorial knot theorist , algebra no longer consists merely of formal manipulations of strings of symbols , but rather of local rewriting moves on labeled figures in the plane and in higher dimensions .",
    "this new philosophy of diagrammatic algebra has become particularly well established in the representation theory of quantum groups , in higher category theory , and in quantum field theory .",
    "perhaps knot diagrams , tangle diagrams , and related objects are logical structures , algebraic structures , and categorical structures as much as they are topological structures ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in this paper , tangle machines are considered primarily as algebraic structures which capture and which highlight an underlying distributive aspect of computation and of information fusion .",
    "turing machines are the heart of theory of computation and complexity theory @xcite .",
    "they formalize the notion of an algorithm or of an effective procedure , and they define the class of computable functions .",
    "there are profound interrelationships between turing machines and low dimensional topology .",
    "for example , the classification of four - manifolds is undecidable due to the unsolvability of the word problem for finitely presented groups ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "but there is an ongoing debate as to whether the non - mathematical church ",
    "turing thesis holds in general , namely , whether any ( intuitively ) computable function is realizable by a turing machine .",
    "it essentially questions the expressiveness of the turing model in various non-(turing ) standard settings . to quote copeland @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it is an open question whether there can be actual deterministic physical processes that , in the long run , elude simulation by a turing machine , and in particular whether any such hypothetical process could usefully be harnessed in the form of a calculating machine ( a hypercomputer ) that could solve the halting problem for a turing machine amongst other things .",
    "it is also an open question whether any such unknown physical processes are involved in the working of the human brain , and whether humans can solve the halting problem . _",

    "we plan to investigate tangle machine simulation of turing machines and of neural nets .",
