    "the cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the greatest basic science endeavor in history .",
    "spectacular physics results are expected to follow in short order once it turns on this year .",
    "lhc will push nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energies up to @xmath7 for @xmath8 collisions and @xmath9 for pb - pb collisions .",
    "the atlas and cms detectors will observe the highest - energy particle collisions produced by the accelerator , whereas the alice detector will observe the very messy debris of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the lhc will probe deeply into the sub - fermi distances , committing to careful searches for new particles and interactions at the tev scale .    at the time of its formulation and for years thereafter , superstring theory was regarded as a unifying framework for planck - scale quantum gravity and tev - scale standard model ( sm ) physics .",
    "important advances were fueled by the realization of the vital role played by d - branes @xcite in connecting string theory to phenomenology @xcite .",
    "this has permitted the formulation of string theories with compositeness setting in at tev scales  @xcite and large extra dimensions .",
    "there are two paramount phenomenological consequences for tev scale d - brane string physics : the emergence of regge recurrences at parton collision energies @xmath10 and the presence of one or more additional @xmath11 gauge symmetries , beyond the @xmath12 of the sm .",
    "the latter follows from the property that the gauge group for open strings terminating on a stack of @xmath13 identical d - branes is @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 for @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 the gauge group can be @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 . ) in this paper we exploit both these properties in order to obtain a `` new physics '' signal at lhc which , if traced to low scale string theory , could with 100 fb@xmath4 of data probe deviations from sm physics at a @xmath5 significance for @xmath20 as large as 2.3  tev .",
    "a short version highlighting the salient results of our analysis has been issued as a companion letter  @xcite .",
    "the present analysis , however , takes into account the recently obtained decay widths of first regge recurrences  @xcite , which are necessary for more precise determination of cross sections in the resonant region .    to develop our program in the simplest way",
    ", we will work within the construct of a minimal model in which we consider scattering processes which take place on the ( color ) @xmath21 stack of d - branes . in the bosonic sector ,",
    "the open strings terminating on this stack contain , in addition to the @xmath22 octet of gluons , an extra @xmath11 boson ( @xmath23 , in the notation of  @xcite ) , most simply the manifestation of a gauged baryon number symmetry .",
    "the @xmath12 boson @xmath24 , which gauges the usual electroweak hypercharge symmetry , is a linear combination of @xmath23 , the @xmath11 boson @xmath25 terminating on a separate @xmath11 brane , and perhaps a third additional @xmath11 ( say @xmath26 ) sharing a @xmath19 brane to which are also a terminus for the @xmath27 electroweak gauge bosons @xmath28 thus , critically for our purposes , the photon @xmath29 , which is a linear combination of @xmath24 and @xmath30 _ will participate with the gluon octet in ( string ) tree level scattering processes on the color brane , processes which in the sm occur only at one - loop level .",
    "_ such a mixing between hypercharge and baryon number is a generic property of d - brane quivers , see _ e.g_.refs.@xcite .",
    "the vector boson @xmath31 , orthogonal to the hypercharge , must grow a mass @xmath32 in order to avoid long range forces between baryons other than gravity and coulomb forces .",
    "the process we consider ( at the parton level ) is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an @xmath22 gluon and @xmath35 is the photon . as explicitly calculated below",
    ", this will occur at string disk ( tree ) level , and will be manifest at lhc as a non - sm contribution to @xmath36 .",
    "a very important property of string disk amplitudes is that they are completely model - independent ; thus the results presented below are robust , because _ they hold for arbitrary compactifications of superstring theory from ten to four dimensions , including those that break supersymmetry_. the sm background for this signal originates in the parton tree level processes @xmath37 .",
    "of course , the sm processes will also receive stringy corrections which should be added to the pure bosonic contribution as part of the signal  @xcite .",
    "we leave this evaluation to a subsequent publication  @xcite ; thus , the contribution from the bosonic process calculated here is to be regarded as a lower bound to the stringy signal . it should also be stated that , in what follows , we do not include effects of kaluza - klein recurrences due to compactification .",
    "we assume that all such effects are in the gravitational sector , and hence occur at higher order in string coupling  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section we outline the calculation of the string amplitude for the process pictured in fig .",
    "[ diag ] and show that there is no amplitude containing the zero mass poles of the sm . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we first calculate cross sections for gluon fusion in the resonance region as well as qcd background , for a simple @xmath38 cut on the transverse momentum of the photon . a vital part of the background discussion concerns the minimization of misidentified @xmath2 s from high-@xmath3 jets .",
    "after that we calculate the signal - to - noise ratio and show that a significant deviation from sm can be obtained for @xmath39  gev for @xmath20 as large a 2.3  tev . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we delineate the search for resonant structure in the data .",
    "our conclusions are collected in sec .",
    "the appendices contain some additional formulae referred to in the main text .",
    "the most direct way to compute the amplitude for the scattering of four gauge bosons is to consider the case of polarized particles because all non - vanishing contributions can be then generated from a single , maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) , amplitude  the so - called _ partial _ mhv amplitude  @xcite .",
    "assume that two vector bosons , with the momenta @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in the @xmath14 gauge group states corresponding to the generators @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( here in the fundamental representation ) , carry negative helicities while the other two , with the momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 and gauge group states @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , carry positive helicities .",
    "( all momenta are incoming . )",
    "then the partial amplitude for such an mhv configuration is given by  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath34 is the @xmath14 coupling constant , @xmath49 are the standard spinor products written in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite , and the veneziano formfactor , @xmath50 is the function of mandelstam variables , here normalized in the string units : @xmath51 ( for simplicity we drop carets for the parton subprocess . ) its low - energy expansion reads @xmath52    we first consider the amplitude involving three @xmath15 gluons @xmath53 and one @xmath11 gauge boson @xmath54 associated to the same @xmath14 quiver : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57 identity matrix and @xmath58 is the @xmath11 charge of the fundamental representation .",
    "the @xmath14 generators are normalized according to @xmath59 then the color factor @xmath60 where the totally symmetric symbol @xmath61 is the symmetrized trace while @xmath62 is the totally antisymmetric structure constant .",
    "the full mhv amplitude can be obtained  @xcite by summing the partial amplitudes ( [ ampl ] ) with the indices permuted in the following way : @xmath63 where the sum runs over all 6 permutations @xmath64 of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "note that in the effective field theory of gauge bosons there are no yang - mills interactions that could generate this scattering process at the tree level . indeed , @xmath67 at the leading order of eq.([vexp ] ) and the amplitude vanishes due to the following identity : @xmath68 similarly , the antisymmetric part of the color factor ( [ colf ] ) cancels out in the full amplitude ( [ afull ] ) . as a result , one obtains : @xmath69 where @xmath70 all non - vanishing amplitudes can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 and the remaining ones can be obtained either by appropriate permutations or by complex conjugation .    in order to obtain the cross section for the ( unpolarized ) partonic subprocess @xmath72 ,",
    "we take the squared moduli of individual amplitudes , sum over final polarizations and colors , and average over initial polarizations and colors . as an example , the modulus square of the amplitude ( [ afull ] ) is : @xmath73 taking into account all @xmath74 possible initial polarization / color configurations and the formula  @xcite @xmath75 we obtain the average squared amplitude @xmath76 where @xmath77    the two most interesting energy regimes of @xmath72 scattering are far below the string mass scale @xmath20 and near the threshold for the production of massive string excitations . at low energies , eq .",

    "the @xmath101 mixing coefficient is model dependent : in the minimal model  @xcite it is quite small , around @xmath102 for couplings evaluated at the @xmath103 mass , which is modestly enhanced to @xmath104 as a result of rg running of the couplings up to 2.5  tev .",
    "it should be noted that in models  @xcite possessing an additional @xmath11 which partners @xmath27 on a @xmath19 brane , the various assignment of the charges can result in values of @xmath99 which can differ considerably from @xmath105 in what follows , we take as a fiducial value @xmath106 thus , if ( [ mhvlow2 ] ) is to describe @xmath107 we modify our definition of @xmath58 given in eq .",
