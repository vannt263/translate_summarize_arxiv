    ", we require a source located at redshift @xmath10 to accelerate protons to energies of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that semi - relativistic hypernova remnants in starburst galaxies , by virtue of their fast ejecta , are able to accelerate protons to eev energies .",
    "alternatively , assuming sufficient amplification of the magnetic fields in the starburst region , normal supernova remnants might also be able to accelerate protons to @xmath12 ev and produce pev neutrinos @xcite .    in @xmath0 collisions , charged and neutral pions are both generated .",
    "charged pions decay to neutrinos ( @xmath13 ) , while neutral pions decay to gamma - rays ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus , pev neutrinos are accompanied by high - energy gamma - rays . for a @xmath1 neutrino spectrum with a single - flavor flux of @xmath15 produced by @xmath16 decay ,",
    "the flux of gamma - rays from @xmath17-decay is @xmath18 .",
    "while low - energy gamma - rays may escape freely from the galaxy , very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - rays are absorbed by the soft photons in starbursts , as starburst galaxies are optically thick to vhe gamma rays @xcite .",
    "the absorbed gamma - rays will convert to electron - positron ( @xmath19 ) pairs , which then initiate electromagnetic cascades on soft background photons , reprocessing the energy of vhe photons to low - energy emission and contributing to the diffuse gamma - ray background   pairs formed during the cascades is not taken into account . assuming a flat cascade gamma - ray spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath20 with @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the additional contribution to the gamma - ray background flux by the cascade emission can reach as much as @xmath22 .",
    "another component that can contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray emission is @xmath19 pairs produced simultaneously with the neutrinos in the @xmath16 decay .",
    "the ic scatterings of these pairs with infrared photons will produce very high energy photons , which may be absorbed and finally contribute to the cascade gamma - ray component with a flux @xmath23 .",
    "noting that the observed gamma - ray background flux observed by fermi / lat is @xmath24 at @xmath25 gev @xcite , the total diffuse gamma - ray flux associated with pev neutrinos in the @xmath0 scenario would thus contribute @xmath26 of the observed diffuse gamma - ray background in the @xmath25 gev range . ] .",
    "detailed calculations show that the diffuse gamma - ray emission associated with sub - pev / pev neutrinos contribute a fraction @xmath27 to the gamma - ray background when the source density follows the star - formation history and contribute a fraction @xmath28 for non - evolving source density case @xcite .",
    "analytical calculations in @xcite show that this fraction is about @xmath28 . since",
    "other sources , such as agns @xcite or truly diffuse gamma - ray emission from the propagation of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) in cosmic microwave and infrared background radiation , also contribute significantly to the diffuse gamma - ray background , a tension between a too high diffuse gamma - ray flux expected from sources and the observed background flux exists .",
    "however , the above calculations do not consider the synchrotron cooling of electron - positron ( @xmath19 ) pairs formed during the cascades . as we argue in this paper",
    ", this synchrotron loss effect could reduce the flux of cascade gamma - ray emission significantly .    in this paper , we calculate the accumulated diffuse gamma - ray flux by considering the synchrotron loss of @xmath19 produced by the absorbed gamma - rays in the magnetic fields of the starburst region . for reasonable assumptions of the strength of the magnetic fields in the starburst region , we find that the synchrotron loss dominates over the inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering loss .",
    "since the synchrotron emission goes into energies below gev , the intensity of the cascade gamma - ray component is significantly reduced in the @xmath25 gev energy range . in  2 ,",
    "we first obtain the normalization of the gamma - ray flux of an individual starburst galaxy with the observed neutrino flux . in  3 , we calculate the gamma - ray flux after considering the synchrotron loss .",
    "then in  4 , we calculate the accumulated gamma - ray flux from the population of starburst galaxies .",
    "finally we give our conclusions and discussions in  5 .",
    "to calculate the accumulated diffuse gamma - ray flux , we need to know the the gamma - ray flux from individual starburst galaxies and then integrate over contributions by all the starburst galaxies in the universe .",
    "the gamma - ray flux of an individual galaxy can be then calibrated with the observed neutrino flux , assuming that all the observed neutrinos by icecube are produced by starburst galaxies .",
    "as the neutrino flux is linearly proportionally to the cosmic - ray proton flux and the efficiency in transferring the proton energy to secondary pions , the single - flavor ( @xmath6 ) neutrino luminosity per unit energy from a starburst galaxy is expressed by @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the cr proton flux at some fixed energy and @xmath32 is the pion production efficiency .",

    ", the energy loss time is @xmath52 we use @xmath53 as the reference value and @xmath54 in the following calculations . ] because neutrinos are dominantly produced by high redshift starbursts , as implied by the star - formation history , and high redshift starburst typically have @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "there are two ways for crs to escape from a galaxy .",
    "one is the advective escape via a galactic wind and the other is the diffusive escape .",
    "the advective escape time is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the velocity of galactic wind .",
    "one can see that protons lose almost all their energy in dense starburst galaxies with @xmath58 , if the advective time is shorter than the diffusive escape time .",
    "little is known about the diffusive escape time in starbursts .",
    "the diffusive escape time can be estimated as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are normalization factors , and @xmath63 depending on the spectrum of interstellar magnetic turbulence . as in @xcite and @xcite , we assume a lower diffusion coefficient @xmath64 at @xmath65 for starburst galaxies , because the magnetic fields in nearby starburst galaxies such as m82 and ngc253 are observed to be @xmath66 times stronger than in our galaxy and the diffusion coefficient is expected to scale with the cr larmor radius in the case of bohm diffusion .",
    "the fact that no break in the gev - tev gamma - ray spectrum up to several tev from hess observations also suggests a small diffusion coefficient in starburst galaxies @xcite .",

    "we also find that the spectrum of the accumulated neutrino flux , as given by eq.(7 ) , is flat ( @xmath102 ) for either choice of the diffusive escape times in eq.(5 ) or eq.(6 ) .    for @xmath0 collisions ,",
    "the energy flux in @xmath17-decay gamma - rays is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 represents the differential cr energy flux .",
    "since the neutrino flux is @xmath105 , the gamma - ray luminosity per unit energy resulted from the @xmath17-decay is related to the neutrino luminosity by @xmath106 thus the @xmath17-decay photon luminosity per unit energy of a single starburst should be @xmath107 for @xmath35 .",

    "while the low - energy gamma - rays can escape and contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background , the vhe gamma - rays will be absorbed due to the dense photon field in the starburst region .",
    "the absorbed gamma - rays will be converted into @xmath19 pairs , which initiate cascades through interactions with the soft photons . as the vhe gamma - rays cascade down to enough low energies",
    ", they can escape out of the starburst and also contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "below we consider the separate contributions by the absorbed gamma - rays and the unabsorbed ones .",
    "rapid star formation process makes an intense infrared photon field in the starburst .",
    "the vhe gamma - ray photons may be absorbed by background photons and generate @xmath19 pairs .",
    "the optical depth is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the cross section for pair - production @xcite and @xmath110 is the number density the infrared background photons .",
    "we adopt the optical - infrared spectral energy models for the nuclei of starburst galaxies developed by and take arp 220 as a template for starbursts to calculate the absorption optical depth . using arp220 as",
    "a template is because its infrared luminosity is close to luminosities of those starburst galaxies that contribute dominantly to the diffuse neutrino background ( see  4 ) .",
    "we find that the absorption energy does not change too much if we use m82 as a template instead . for simplicity , we assume all starbursts have the same photon spectra as arp 220 . with such simplifications ,",

    "it can be seen that photons with energies above @xmath115 will be absorbed inside the starburst region .",
    "the @xmath17 decay gamma - rays above @xmath112 will be absorbed in the soft photons in the starbursts and produce pairs , each carrying about half energy of the initial photons ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "these pairs , together with the pairs resulted from @xmath16 decay , will cool through synchrotron and ic emission .",
    "the synchrotron photon energy is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the energy of @xmath19 pairs and @xmath71 is the magnetic field in the starburst region . under reasonable assumptions about the magnetic field in the starburst region",
    ", the synchrotron photon energy is below gev energies , so their contribution to the diffuse gamma - ray flux at @xmath25 gev is negligible .",
    "note that the most constraining point of the gamma - ray background is around 100 gev , since the observed gamma - ray background flux decreases with the energy .",

    "the ic photons above @xmath112 will be absorbed and an electro - magnetic cascade will be developed .",
    "this cascade process transfers the energy of absorbed gamma - rays to lower and lower energies , until the secondary photons can escape from absorption .",
    "the escaped gamma - ray photons can then contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background . in order to calculate the fraction of the energy loss of @xmath19 pairs transferred to the cascade emission",
    ", we need to know the energy loss fraction of @xmath19 through the ic emission .",
    "energy loss timescales are crucial for assessing the fraction of energy loss in these two processes .",
    "@xcite argued that in order for starburst galaxies to fall on the observed fir - radio correlation , the synchrotron cooling time in starbursts must be shorter than the ic cooling time and the escape time for relativistic electrons .",
    "the reason is that , if this constraint is not satisfied , any variation in the ratio between the magnetic field and photon energy density ( @xmath124 ) would lead to large changes in the fraction of cosmic ray electron energy radiated via synchrotron radiation .",
    "a linear fir - radio correlation would then require significant fine tuning .",
    "the synchrotron timescale depends on the magnetic field in the starburst region .",
    "the magnetic fields in starbursts are not well - understood and we parameterize the strength of the magnetic field in terms of the gas surface density @xmath125 with the following three scalings : + i ) first , in the assumption that the magnetic energy density equilibrates with the total hydrostatic pressure of the interstellar medium , @xmath126 @xcite , where @xmath127 is the gravitational constant .",
    "fields strength as large as this equipartition are possible if the magnetic energy density equilibrates with the turbulent energy density of the ism . the measurements of zeeman splitting associated with oh megamasers for eight galaxies suggest that the magnetic energy density in the interstellar medium of starburst galaxies is indeed comparable to their hydrostatic gas pressure @xcite .",
    "+ ii)@xmath128 is sometimes assumed , motivated by setting the magnetic energy density equal to the pressure in the ism produced by star formation ( @xmath129 ) . because of @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 is the star formation rate per unit area ) and the schmidt scaling law for star - formation @xmath132 @xcite , the scaling @xmath128 follows .",
    "+ iii)the third is the minimum energy magnetic field case @xmath133 , which is obtained using the observed radio flux and assuming comparable cosmic - ray and magnetic energy densities @xcite .",
    "although such a low magnetic field is not favored , as argued in various aspects @xcite , we keep this case in the calculation just to illustrate the difference when a low magnetic field strength is considerred .",
    "+ thus , the strength of the magnetic fields can be summarized as @xcite @xmath134as the gas surface density @xmath135 scales with the surface density of star formation rate as @xmath136 and the star formation rate ( @xmath137 ) scales linearly with the total infrared luminosity @xmath138 , we get the relation ( assuming a constant star - formation radius @xmath51 ) @xmath139    the synchrotron energy loss timescale of @xmath140 is @xmath141 @xcite , while the ic energy loss timescale of relativistic @xmath140 , for a graybody approximation for the soft background photons , is given by @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the energy density of the soft photons , @xmath144 , @xmath145 is the temperature of the graybody radiation field and @xmath120 is the lorentz factor of @xmath146 .",
    "note that eq.(14 ) applies to both the thomson scatterings and the scatterings in the klein - nishina regime when @xmath120 is very high .    the fraction of the energy loss through synchrotron radiation is @xmath147 for one electron or positron of a particular energy . since this fraction is a function of the energy of @xmath19 ,",
    "we integrate it over a proper energy range to estimate the fraction of the total energy loss of @xmath19 through synchrotron radiation in the energy range , which is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is used for the maximum energy of @xmath19 , corresponding to a maximum neutrino energy of @xmath150 .",
    "we show , in fig.2 , this fraction for starburst galaxies with different @xmath138 .",
    "the black , red and blue lines represent , respectively , the @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 cases .",
    "it shows that for both the @xmath151 and @xmath152 cases , the synchrotron loss constitute a fraction @xmath154 of the total energy loss .",
    "there are two factors that leads to such a large synchrotron loss fraction : 1 ) the magnetic energy density is larger than the photon energy density in these cases ; 2 ) the klein - nishina effect for @xmath19 above @xmath155 @xcite causes the ic energy loss time to increase with @xmath120 , while the synchrotron loss time continues to fall as @xmath156 .",
    "while the synchrotron loss energy goes into low - energy emission and thus does not contribute to the diffuse high - energy gamma - ray background , the ic loss energy will cascade down to the relevant energy range of the diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "if the cascade develops sufficiently , the spectrum of the cascade emission has a nearly universal form of @xmath157 where @xmath112 is the absorption cutoff energy , @xmath158 is the break energy corresponding to @xmath159 , and @xmath160 typically .",
    "the spectrum above @xmath112 decreases rapidly as @xmath161 .",
    "the normalization of the cascade emission spectrum is determined by equating the total cascade energy with the total ic energy loss above @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the energy of all @xmath17-decay gamma - rays above @xmath112 and the factor @xmath164 represents the sum contributions by the @xmath17-decay gamma - rays and the gamma - rays from ic scattering of @xmath165-decay @xmath140 , the latter of which has a flux about half of that of @xmath17-decay gamma - rays .      the gamma - rays from @xmath17 decay with energies below @xmath112 will escape out of the starburst galaxies and contribute directly to the diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "this flux is model - independent and readily obtained from the observed neutrino flux by using eq.(10 ) . for a flat neutrino spectrum ,",
    "the differential flux of @xmath17-decay gamma - rays below @xmath112 is @xmath166 .",
    "as we pointed out before , the electrons and positrons accompanying with the neutrino production in the @xmath16 decay also contribute to the diffuse gamma - rays through ic scattering of soft background photons .",
    "these @xmath19 pairs cool by both synchrotron and ic emission .",
    "we denote the flux contributed by ic process with @xmath167 , which is important only when the magnetic energy density in the starburst region is low .",
    "therefore the flux of the unabsorbed gamma - rays is @xmath168    adding the luminosity of the unabsorbed gamma - rays and that of the cascade gamma - rays , we get the total gamma - ray photon luminosity emitted from one starburst galaxy @xmath169",
    "once the gamma - rays escape out of the starburst galaxy , they will further interact with the extragalactic infrared and microwave background photons , and similar cascades are formed for vhe gamma - rays . in this case , however , @xmath112 is different and dependent on the redshift distribution of starburst galaxies .",
    "the cascade emission spectrum has the same form as equation ( 16 ) .",
    "taking such cosmic cascades into consideration , the accumulated gamma - ray flux includes two parts , one is from the direct source contribution and the other is from the intergalactic cascades , i.e. @xmath170 where @xmath171 represents the direct source contribution by starburst galaxies and @xmath172 represents the flux from the intergalactic cascades .",
    "the direct source contribution can be obtained by integrating the contributions of all starburst galaxies in the universe over their redshift and luminosity range , i.e. , @xmath173}{h_{0}\\sqrt{(1+z)^{3}\\omega _",
    "{ m}+\\omega _ { \\lambda } } } dl_{\\rm tir}dz , \\ ] ] where @xmath174 = { l_{total}}[(1 + z){e_\\gamma } ] { e^{-\\tau ' _ { \\gamma\\gamma } ( { e_\\gamma } , z)}}$ ] and @xmath175 is the absorption optical depth due to the extragalactic infrared and microwave background photons .    the accumulated diffuse gamma - ray flux are shown in figures 3 - 5 for the cases of @xmath53 , @xmath114 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "it can be seen that , the diffuse gamma - ray flux in the case considering the synchrotron loss is less than half of that in the case neglecting the synchrotron loss .",
    "this is because that the cascade component resulted from the absorbed gamma - rays is strongly suppressed due to the synchrotron radiation of the @xmath19 .",
    "the accumulated diffuse gamma - ray flux after considering the synchrotron loss effect contributes @xmath176 of the observed diffuse gamma - ray background by fermi / lat at @xmath177 for both @xmath178 and @xmath128 cases .",
    "for a steeper neutrino spectrum , since the energy fraction in absorbed gamma - rays above @xmath112 is lower , this effect is expected to be less important . as in @xcite",
    ", we study the allowed range of the spectral index by the observed gamma - ray background data .",
    "we find that the index must be @xmath179 , as shown in fig.6 , in order not to violate the observed gamma - ray background data by fermi / lat , which is in agreement with the results in @xcite .",
    "we also study how much the starburst galaxies in different luminosity ranges and redshift ranges contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "fig.7 shows the contributions in each luminosity range to the total flux .",
    "it can be seen that most flux is contributed by the starbursts in the luminosity range from 10@xmath180 to 10@xmath181 @xmath182 . for starburst galaxies of such high luminosity ,",
    "the pion production efficiency @xmath32 is close to 1 and these galaxies are proton calorimeters .",
    "fig.8 shows the contributions by starburst galaxies in different redshift ranges to the total flux .",
    "as expected , the dominant contribution is by starburst galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath183 .",
    "starburst galaxies , which have many supernova or hypernova explosions , are proposed to be a possible source for the sub - pev / pev neutrinos recently detected by icecube @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the minimum diffuse gamma - ray flux associated with these sub - pev / pev neutrinos is about @xmath184 , which is a factor of two lower than the case without considering the synchrotron loss of the @xmath185 pairs resulted from the absorption of very high energy photons .",
    "this minimum diffuse gamma - ray flux constitute a fraction of @xmath176 of the observed gamma - ray background flux at @xmath25 gev energies , thus leaving a relatively large room for other sources to contribute to the gamma - ray background .",
    "it was proposed that hypernovae remnants in starburst galaxies accelerate protons to @xmath186 @xcite , which then produce pev neutrinos via @xmath0 collisions with the dense surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "remnants of normal supernovae may accelerate protons to pev energies , so they may not contribute to the @xmath187 tev neutrino flux , but they can produce @xmath188 tev gamma rays , thus contributing to the diffuse gamma - ray background as well .",
    "but as long as the diffuse gamma - ray flux contributed by these normal supernovae does not exceed that contributed by the hypernova remnants too much , the total diffuse flux may still fall below the observed background",
    ". it may be also possible that , if the remnants of normal supernovae produce a gamma - ray flux 3 - 4 times higher , the total gamma - ray flux from starburst galaxies can reach the level of the observed one .",
