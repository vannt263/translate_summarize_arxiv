    "as a variant of blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite , the magnetic coupling ( mc ) between the central rotating black hole ( bh ) and its surrounding accretion disks has received much attention ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by virtue of the large - scale closed magnetic field lines that connect the bh and its surrounding disk , the mc process conveys energy and angular momentum between the bh and the disk .",
    "@xcite showed that in the standard disk ( ssd , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) case the mc process may change the local radiative flux significantly .",
    "apart from ssd , adaf is another important model of the accretion flow ( @xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it has been applied to a number of accreting bh systems and successfully explains their spectral characteristics ( see narayan 2005 and yuan 2007 for recent reviews ) . in adaf models",
    "the thickness of the accretion flow is of the same order as radius , i.e. @xmath5 , which means the large - scale field is easier to form in an adaf than in a ssd @xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to investigate the influences of the mc process on an adaf .",
    "very recently , @xcite discussed this problem based on the self - similar solution of the adaf . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the influences of the mc process on adafs through global solutions .    to properly assess the dynamical effects of large - scale magnetic fields on the accretion flow",
    ", one needs to obtain the fluids and the fields at the same time by solving the transfield equation , which is a nontrivial nonlinear partial differential equation with singular surfaces and free functions @xcite .",
    "an alternative way is mhd simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . however , both of these approaches are complicated . @xcite and @xcite adopted a phenomenological approach to research the magnetic coupling between the neutron star and its surrounding slim disk .",
    "they specified an ansatz for the magnetic fields and then numerically solve the basic equations of the accretion flow . in their model",
    "the disk is geometrically thin , @xmath6 , and so the expressions of electromagnetic forces can be much reduced by omitting @xmath7 terms .",
    "however , an mcadaf is thick and the expression of the electromagnetic force is complex . here for simplicity we treat the mc process as a source of energy and angular moment without considering the radial and vertical components of the electromagnetic force in the momentum equations .",
    "we derive the energy and angular momentum fluxes in the kerr metric by using the approach of equivalent circuit @xcite .",
    "but for simplicity a pseudo - newtonian potential of a rotating black hole given by @xcite is adopted when we solve the solutions of the accretion flow .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the mcadaf model and calculate the energy and angular momentum fluxes transferred by the magnetic field . in section 3",
    ", we write down the basic equations describing the mcadaf .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section 4 and section 5 is devoted to a summary and discussions . throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "c = g=1 are used .",
    "we assume the adaf is stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "the adaf extends from the outer edge , @xmath8 , to the bh horizon @xmath9 .",
    "there are two kinds of magnetic fields in this model , i.e. , large - scale closed magnetic field that connects the bh with the adaf and small - scale tangled magnetic field , with the former contributing to the mc process and the latter to the viscosity .",
    "we assume these two kinds of fields work independently .",
    "if not mentioned we refer the magnetic field as the large - scale closed one hereafter .",
    "the region between the bh and the adaf is assumed to be ideally conducting and force - free .",
    "the field lines are supposed to distribute in the ranges of @xmath10 on the disk and @xmath11 on the horizon . due to the lack of knowledge about the magnetic field around the bh",
    ", we assume that the field threading the bh is constant , i.e. @xmath12 . the field threading the adaf is assumed to decrease with @xmath13 following a power law form , but within the marginally stable orbit , @xmath14 , the radial velocity of the accretion flow increases much faster thus the filed is likely to increase with radius . given this consideration , we assume the field has the following distribution ,    @xmath15    here @xmath16 denotes the radius of the bh horizon",
    ", @xmath17 is the dimensionless spin parameter of the bh , and @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite gave an estimation of @xmath19 with the balance between the ram pressure of the falling material and the magnetic pressure , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "since the ram pressure can be larger than the magnetic press , we introduce a parameter @xmath21 to indicate the strength of the magnetic field threading the horizon as    @xmath22    in the following derivation of this subsection , the boyer - lindquist coordinates are used .",
    "assume all the field lines threading the bh are connected with the disk , then from the conservation of magnetic flux we have    @xmath23    where the subscripts `` h '' and",
    "`` d '' are used to indicate the quantities on the horizon and the equatorial plane of the disk ( @xmath24 ) , respectively .",

    "substituting equation ( [ eq1 ] ) into equation ( [ eq3 ] ) we get    @xmath33    given the configuration of the field , we can derive the energy and angular momentum flux in the mc process by using the modified equivalent circuit approach @xcite . considering a loop corresponds to two adjacent flux surfaces ( characterized by the magnetic flux @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath35 , the electromotive force due to the rotation of the bh and the disk are expressed as    @xmath36    the minus sign in the expression of @xmath37 arise from the direction of the flux .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is the angular velocity of the adaf , @xmath39 is the angular velocity of the bh horizon .",
    "the equivalent surface resistivity of the bh horizon is @xmath40 @xcite , while the surface resistivity of the disk is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the diffusivity of the magnetic field . as in many papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the resistances of the annular ring on the horizon and the disk are thus @xmath46    @xmath47    thus the current in the loop is @xmath48    in order to obtain @xmath49 and @xmath50 we have to find the value of @xmath51 , which is related to the mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the horizon and the radial coordinate on the disk , i.e. @xmath52 . according to the conservation of the magnetic flux between the adjacent two flux surfaces , @xmath53 substitute equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) into the above equation ,",
    "we get @xmath54 integrate equation ( [ eq11 ] ) and we obtain the mapping relation : @xmath55    our calculations show that , for the adaf , the ratio of the height to radius around @xmath9 is @xmath56 , thus we assume @xmath57 so that @xmath58 .",
    "substitute equation ( [ eq11 ] ) into equation ( [ eq9 ] ) we have @xmath59}\\ ] ]    since the current @xmath50 on the bh horizon feels ampere s force , the bh exerts a net torque on the magnetic flux tube @xmath60 from the second equality it is easy to find that this torque equals to the torque exerted on the disk by the same flux tube , or equivalently speaking , the angular momentum flows between the bh and the disk . the angular momentum flux can be written as @xmath61    the power transmitted to the disk through the tube is given by    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the angular velocity of the magnetic filed lines , @xmath64 is the rate of the mechanical work done by the electromagnetic torque on the disk and @xmath65 is the rate of ohmic heating in the disk .",
    "it is easy to calculate the power dissipated on the bh s stretched horizon intersecting with the flux tube :    @xmath66    which increases the irreducible mass of the bh .",
    "we assume the energy and angular momentum transferred by the mc process deposit into the accretion flow homogeneously in the vertical direction .",
    "the height - averaged basic equations describing the mcadaf can be written as @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the accretion rate , @xmath73 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath74 is the total pressure of the tangled magnetic field and the gas pressure , @xmath75 is the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure and is fixed at its `` typical '' value @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the temperature , @xmath78 is the entropy .",
    "the subscripts  i \" and  e \" indicate the quantities for ions and electrons , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath79 is the @xmath80 component of the viscous stress tensor adopting the @xmath81 prescription @xcite , @xmath82 is the vertical scale height , @xmath83 is the keplerian angular velocity calculated by using the pseudo - newton potential given by @xcite , @xmath84 describes the fraction of the total energy that directly heats the electrons and is set to be @xmath85 following the detailed modeling result to the supermassive black hole in our galactic center @xcite , @xmath86 is the heating rate of the viscosity , @xmath87 represents the volume energy transfer rate from ions to electrons via coulomb collisions , @xmath88 is the cooling rate of the electrons , which consists of bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and comptonization @xcite , and @xmath89 is the rate of ohmic dissipation per unit area of the disk .    adopting the no - torque boundary condition at the horizon , we integrate equation ( [ eq20 ] ) from @xmath9 to @xmath13 and get the conservation equation for the angular momentum @xmath90 where @xmath91 @xmath92 with @xmath93 being the angular momentum per unit mass swallowed by the bh .",
    "the three terms on left - hand side of equation ( [ eq23 ] ) correspond to the advected angular momentum , viscous torque and magnetic torque due to the field lines in the range from @xmath13 to @xmath8 .",
    "one more relation is given by the equation of state , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath96 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath97 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "thus we have a set of six equations including one integral , two algebraic , and three differential equations , i.e. equations ( [ eq18 ] ) , ( [ eq19 ] ) , ( [ eq21])-([eq23 ] ) , and ( [ eq26 ] ) for six unknown quantities , @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "this set of equations can be solved with three outer boundary conditions and some given parameters ( we will specify them later ) .",
    "however , there is some difficulty in obtaining @xmath102 from the integral equation , viz .",
    "equation ( [ eq23 ] ) .",
    "so we use the first - order approximation , @xmath105",
    "we adopt @xmath106 and @xmath107 in this paper . regarding the outer boundary of the adaf , the ion temperature @xmath103 should be of the same order as the virial temperature , and the electron temperature @xmath104 should be somewhat lower than @xmath103 because of the radiation of the electrons .",
    "the angular velocity of the accreting flow should be sub - keplerian @xcite .",
    "so we impose the boundary conditions as @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 . at",
    "last , by adjusting the eigenvalue of the problem , @xmath111 , we can obtain the global transonic solution , i.e. , a solution that can pass through the sonic point smoothly .",
    "the free parameters of our mcadaf model include @xmath112 , @xmath21 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath81 , and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 with the eddington accretion rate @xmath117 .",
    "the first parameter describes the spin of the bh , the next three are associated with the magnetic field , and the last two describe the adaf .",
    "figure [ fzita ] shows the curve of @xmath118 when @xmath119 ( corresponding to @xmath120 ) , @xmath121 , @xmath1 and @xmath122 .",
    "as the figure shows , the resistance of the disk is small compared with the resistance on the stretched horizon .",
    "especially , at the outer boundary , the resistance of the disk is completely negligible .",
    "since the distribution of the magnetic field we assumed is not smooth , there is a break at @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ fomeg ] shows the curves of @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the same parameters as figure [ fzita ] . from this figure",
    "we find that @xmath127 always lies between @xmath125 and @xmath102 , which agrees with equation ( [ omf ] ) .",
    "we also find that the relative angular velocity of the magnetic field lines to the disk , i.e. @xmath126 , achieves maximum at some radius between the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "this is a natural result because @xmath126 is proportional to the product of two factors , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( see equation ( [ omf ] ) ) , which approach to zero at the outer and inner boundaries , respectively . at the innermost region ,",
    "this unphysical result arise because we do not use the exact general relativity .    from figure [ fq ]",
    "we can get some ideas of the partitioning of the magnetically - extracted rotational energy of the bh . in this figure",
    "we show the curves of the rate of mechanical work due to electromagnetic torque and three kinds of heating rates per unit area .",
    "the solid line represents @xmath131 , the long dashed line for @xmath132 , the short dashed line for the ohmic dissipation on the bh s stretched horizon , @xmath133 , while the dotted line for the viscous heating rate per unit area , @xmath134 .",
    "as the figure shows , @xmath131 dominates over @xmath135 in the outer region of the disk while the latter dominates in the inner region .",
    "compare @xmath136 with @xmath137 , we find the efficiency of extracting energy from the bh to the disk is very small except in the inner region .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that the mc power is small in contrast to the viscous heating rate .",
    "the profiles of the radial mach number , surface density @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , specific angular momentum @xmath141 , and the advection factor @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) of the accretion flow for different @xmath21 are shown in figure [ fk ] .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed lines correspond to @xmath121 , 0.5 , and 0 , respectively .    from figure",
    "[ fk ] we find that , when the mc process is present , the sonic point moves inward , @xmath139 decreases , @xmath138 and @xmath140 increase , while @xmath141 and @xmath142 decrease in the outer region and increase in the inner region .",
    "these effects can be understood as follows . as the spin of the bh is very fast ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "angular momentum and energy are transferred from the bh to the disk .",
    "the energy flux raises the temperature of the ions .",
    "the angular momentum flux hinders the infalling of the accreting material .",
    "thus the sonic point moves inward and the surface density increases .",
    "since the optical depth is proportional to the surface density , the compton cooling rate goes up , and consequently , the temperature of the electrons decreases . compared with the case without mc process ,",
    "the @xmath144 component of the viscous stress tensor in a mcadaf around a fast rotating bh is a bit larger due to the higher pressure @xmath145 in the outer region , so the angular momentum is transferred more efficiently and the specific angular momentum there is smaller .",
    "but at small radius , the increase of the angular momentum due to the mc process dominates over the decrease due to the viscous torque , so that the specific angular momentum can even increase , as can be seen from equation ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "similarly , in the outer region of the disk the radiative cooling rate becomes higher and @xmath142 decreases , while in the inner region @xmath142 goes up because the heating rate due to the mc process increases more quickly than the radiative cooling rate does .",
    "additionally , as the magnetic field threading the bh becomes stronger , the influences of the mc process become more significant .",
    "however , as figure [ fq ] shows , the contribution of the mc process is of less importance , so its influences are small .",
    "figure [ fla ] shows the influences of the parameter @xmath146 ( ref .",
    "the paragraph below eq .",
    "1 ) . the solid and dashed lines are for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively . for comparison purpose the dotted line is shown for the case without mc process . from this figure",
    "we see that the effects of increasing @xmath146 are similar to those of increasing @xmath31 .",
    "this is because the magnetic field in the region @xmath32 strengthens as these two parameters increase .",
    "although the increase of @xmath146 also leads to the decrease of the magnetic field in the region @xmath149 , the mc effects are small in this region , because the gravitational force there is so strong and the radial velocity is so high that the energy and angular momentum transferred by the mc process do not play any significant role .",
    "figure [ fn ] shows the effects of parameter @xmath114 ( ref .",
    "1 ) . the solid and dashed lines are for @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "the lines for the case without mc process are shown with the dotted lines . from this figure",
    "we find that the mc effects are more significant for smaller @xmath114 .",
    "it is because the magnetic field is weaker in the outer region ( @xmath152 ) when @xmath114 is bigger , which can be seen from equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "we calculate the influence of the mc process on the radiative efficiency of the adaf .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ feta ] .",
    "the parameters are @xmath153 and @xmath154 . the quantity @xmath155 denotes the critical accretion rate of an adaf , which is @xmath156 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the radiative efficiency increased by the mc process is written as @xmath157 , where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the efficiencies of the mcadaf and pure adaf , respectively . from figure [ feta ]",
    "we find that , when @xmath1 , the mc process can raise the efficiency by about one percentage point , i.e. , @xmath160 .",
    "but when @xmath2 the effect of the mc process is very weak .",
    "the efficiency goes up because of two reasons : firstly , the mc process transports additional energy to the adaf ; secondly the angular momentum transported by the mc process decreases the radial velocity of the adaf , and thus makes the adaf more efficient in radiating .",
    "when @xmath81 is smaller , the specific angular momentum of the accreting material is larger since viscosity is less efficient in moving angular momentum out , and consequently , the difference between the angular velocities of the bh and the disk is smaller .",
    "considering equations ( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ pmc ] ) , the angular momentum and energy transported by the mc process decrease .    in all the above discussions ,",
    "the spin of the bh is very large .",
    "the angular momentum and energy are transferred from the bh to the disk .",
    "if the bh rotates slowly , the angular momentum and energy may be transferred from the disk to the bh . however , since @xmath161 is proportional to @xmath112 , the mc effect is not so significant as the case when @xmath162 .",
    "in addition , there is a critical value of @xmath112 , at which the total energy and angular momentum transmitted by the mc process are zero and consequently @xmath163 . in the ssd case",
    "this value is about @xmath164 for @xmath165 @xcite , whereas in our mcadaf model , it is about 0.172 .",
    "the critical value is smaller in the mcadaf case because the angular velocity of the adaf is sub - keplerian .",
    "the spin of the bh can even be negative , i.e. , retrograde spin . from equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] )",
    "it is easy to find that the angular momentum always flows from the adaf to the bh when @xmath166 .",
    "if the resistance of the adaf is zero , i.e. @xmath167 or @xmath168 , the energy flows in the same direction as that of the angular momentum , as can be seen from equation ( [ pmc ] ) .",
    "if @xmath49 is nonzero and big enough , ohmic dissipation in the disk may offset the loss of energy that conveyed to the bh . according to equation ( [ pmc ] ) ,",
    "the critical condition is @xmath169 , or equivalently , @xmath170 .",
    "our calculations show that when @xmath166 , @xmath49 is so small that @xmath171 holds for almost all cases , and the net energy flows from the adaf to the bh .",
    "if the bh rotates rapidly , e.g. @xmath172 , the effects of the mc process will be negative compared to the case of @xmath3 : the radial velocity and the temperature of the electrons increase , the sonic point moves outward , the temperatures of the ions decrease , etc .",
    "in this paper we investigate the influence of the magnetic coupling process on the dynamics of the adaf .",
    "the effects of the mc process on the basic equations of the accretion flow is simplified as a source of angular momentum and energy .",
    "the angular momentum and energy fluxes are derived with the equivalent circuit approach .",
    "we find that when the bh rotates fast ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) and when the viscous parameter @xmath0 is large , @xmath1 , for reasonable magnetic field , the mc process can mildly affect the dynamics of the adaf , increasing the ion temperature and the density of the accretion flow and decreasing the electron temperature and the radial velocity .",
    "the mc process can also raise the effciency of the adaf by @xmath4 .",
    "but if @xmath2 or smaller , the influences of the mc process are much weaker and can be neglected .    in the above calculations the strength of the magnetic field is estimated following @xcite , which is equivalent to assume @xmath173",
    "obviously uncertainties exist in the above estimation . on the one hand ,",
    "recent mhd simulations show that the magnetic field strength near the horizon can be very high , almost four times as large as the the equipartition value @xcite , which corresponding roughly to @xmath174 . on the other hand",
    ", our calculation requires that there exists an upper limit to the value of @xmath31 .",
    "this is because if @xmath31 were too large , the transferred angular momentum from the bh to the accretion flow would be so significant that the accretion could not proceed due to the strong centrifugal force .",
    "we find that the highest value of @xmath31 depends on the accretion rate for given @xmath112 .",
    "it can be @xmath175 if the accretion rate is very low but @xmath176 if the accretion rate is as high as @xmath177 . considering the above two limitations on @xmath31 , the increased efficiency due to the mc process @xmath178 can be as high as @xmath179 .",
    "observations of the hard state of bh x - ray binaries sometimes show luminosities as high as @xmath180 , which are much higher than @xmath181 , the highest luminosity that an adaf surrounding a schwarzschild bh can produce @xcite .",
    "when the accretion rate is higher than the critical rate of an adaf , the accretion flow enters into the regime of the luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the highest luminosity an lhaf surrounding a non - rotating bh ( with @xmath182 ) can produce was @xmath183 , which is still too low .",
    "they speculated that when the spin of the bh and the mc process were taken into account , the highest luminosity an lhaf could produce would possibly be high enough to explain the observed high @xmath184 .",
    "now , taking into account the black hole spin and the mc process , we recalculate the maximum luminosity an lhaf ( with @xmath185 ) can produce , with reasonable parameters such as @xmath3 , @xmath186 ( note this is the largest possible value when @xmath185 ) and @xmath154 .",
    "we find the highest luminosity is @xmath187 .",
    "the increase due to the mc process is @xmath188 while that due to the bh spin is @xmath189 .",
    "so the mc process seems not so helpful to increase the highest luminosity an lhaf can produce to explain the observed highest @xmath190 .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the closed field extends to the outer boundary of the adaf according to a power law . as a matter of fact",
    "the magnetic connection between the bh and the disk can be maintained only within a limited radius .",
    "@xcite discussed the constraint of the screw instability to the mc region of a ssd based on the kruskal - shafranov criterion : the screw instability will occur , if the magnetic field line turns around itself about once @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the mc region is limited within some critical radii on the ssd . by numerically solving the grad - shafranov equation , the main differential equation that describes the structure of the magnetosphere",
    ", @xcite argued that for a rapidly - rotating bh the field lines are frame - dragged by the bh so much , and the toroidal magnetic field becomes so strong that the magnetic connection between the bh and the disk can not be maintained over a large range of radii on the disk .",
    "we shall address this issue in the context of adaf in our further work .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her very constructive suggestions and careful examination , which greatly improve the presentation .",

    "<S> a large - scale closed magnetic field can transfer angular momentum and energy between a black hole ( bh ) and its surrounding accretion flow . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effects of this magnetic coupling ( mc ) process on the dynamics of a hot accretion flow ( e.g. , an advection dominated accretion flow , hereafter adaf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy and angular momentum fluxes transported by the magnetic field are derived by an equivalent circuit approach . for a rapidly rotating bh </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the radial velocity and the electron temperature of the accretion flow decrease , whereas the ion temperature and the surface density increase . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the mc effects depends on the value of the viscous parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the effects are obvious for @xmath1 but nearly ignorable for @xmath2 . for a bh with specific angular momentum , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that for reasonable parameters the radiative efficiency of a hot accretion flow can be increased by @xmath4 . </S>"
