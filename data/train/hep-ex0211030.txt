    "the macro detector @xcite was located in the gran sasso laboratory ( italy ) and allowed the study of atmospheric neutrinos detecting upgoing muons produced in cc interactions inside or around the detector .",
    "it used scintillation counters for tagging events by time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements , and limited streamer tubes for tracking .",
    "three categories of @xmath5-induced muon events were studied ( see fig . [",
    "f : topo ] ) : 1 ) upthroughgoing muons , produced in the rock below the detector and crossing the whole apparatus , with an average energy @xmath0 50 gev ; 2 ) internal upgoing ( iu ) muons , produced inside and leaving the detector from above ; 3 ) upgoing stopping muons ( ugs ) , produced below and stopping inside the detector plus internal downgoing ( i d ) muons , produced inside and leaving the detector from below . since",
    "at least two scintillation counters are needed to perform a tof measurement , the events of samples ugs and i d are studied on a topological basis and are indistinguishable .",
    "therefore , they are studied together .",
    "the average neutrino energy for samples 2 and 3 is about @xmath6 4 gev , and we collectively refer to these events as to the low energy ( le ) sample @xcite , while events from sample 1 belong to the high energy ( he ) sample @xcite .",
    "events in the he sample have been selected by measuring the tof between two layers of scintillators . for events crossing three layers of scintillators ,",
    "a linear fit of the times as a function of the path lengths has been performed , in order to reduce possible fake events .",
    "a detailed tuning of the tof measurements provided a reduction factor of @xmath7 of the downgoing atmospheric muons .",
    "other sources of background have been reduced by applying a cut on the matching positions between scintillators and streamer tubes .",
    "soft upgoing hadrons coming from photonuclear interactions of muons outside the detector could mimic an upgoing muon : to reduce this background we require that each upgoing muon crosses at least 200 g / cm@xmath4 of absorber in the lower part of the detector @xcite .",
    "muons coming from particular azimuthal regions , where the rock amount is not sufficient to reduce the number of downgoing muons , have been discarded .",
    "863 events survived these cuts ( 809 after background subtraction ) , corresponding to a livetime of 6.16 yrs .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of upgoing muon events has been performed using the @xmath9 flux computed by the bartol group @xcite , neutrino cross sections from ref .",
    "@xcite and muon energy loss in the rock from calculations of ref .",

    "matter effects become important when @xmath16 gev / ev@xmath4 , i.e. for he events .",
    "a detailed analysis @xcite has shown that the best estimator to disentangle the two hypotheses is the ratio @xmath17 between the number of events with -1 @xmath18 -0.7 and the number of events with -0.4 @xmath18 0 , where @xmath19 is the zenith angle . in this ratio ,",

    "the id+ugs sample has been selected only with topological criteria . since no timing informations were available for these events , particular attention has been devoted in order to reject events not perfectly confined in the detector .",
    "these goals have been reached also by means of visual scanning with the event display .",
