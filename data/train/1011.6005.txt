    "powerful jets from compact objects can have significant optical depth to scattering .",
    "the foremost example is gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "they are emitted by hot ultra - relativistic outflows that remain opaque until they travel a large distance from the central engine . where the jet becomes transparent , the trapped radiation is released and contributes to the grb .",
    "its spectrum is expected to be nonthermal because of dissipative processes in the subphotospheric region .",
    "this `` photospheric emission '' is likely the main component of observed grbs .",
    "recent work provides significant support for this picture .",
    "three heating mechanisms have been proposed to shape the photospheric spectrum : ( 1 ) internal shocks , ( 2 ) dissipation of magnetic energy and excited plasma waves ( thompson 1994 ; spruit , daigne , & drenkhahn 2001 ; ioka et al .",
    "2007 ) , and ( 3 ) collisional dissipation ( beloborodov 2010 ; hereafter b10 ) .",
    "the latter mechanism is straightforward to model from first principles and turns out to reproduce the canonical grb spectrum with no fine - tuning of parameters ( b10 ; vurm , beloborodov , & poutanen 2011 ) .",
    "modeling emission from opaque jets requires simulations of radiative transfer .",
    "two methods have been developed for such simulations to date .",
    "first , solving the kinetic equations for the electrons and photons that interact via compton scattering ( peer & waxman 2005 ; vurm et al .",
    "second , tracking a large number of photons that propagate and ( randomly ) scatter in the jet ( giannios 2006 ; b10 ) .",
    "peer ( 2008 ) used an analytic approach and monte - carlo simulations to study individual short pulses of photospheric emission .",
    "none of these works attempted to use the standard transfer equation .",
    "this approach is developed in the present paper .",
    "the extension of radiative transfer theory to relativistic outflows is straightforward ( e.g. castor 1972 ; mihalas 1980 ) . in  2",
    ", we write down the transfer equation that is well - behaved ( and simplifies ) in the ultra - relativistic regime",
    ". then we solve this equation for isotropic (  3 ) and exact (  4 ) models of electron scattering . in parallel",
    ", we apply the independent monte - carlo technique and compare the results .    in  5 we separately consider the case where radiation dominates the outflow energy up to the photosphere .",
    "this regime is of interest for grbs with extremely low baryon loading , as described by paczyski ( 1986 ) and goodman ( 1986 ) .",
    "in contrast to their expectations , the transfer near the photosphere is not complicated and has a simple analytical solution .",
    "we are interested in outflows with lorentz factors @xmath0 and velocities @xmath1 . below we consider radiative transfer in outflows that are steady and spherically symmetric .",
    "these assumptions are not restrictive in the ultra - relativistic regime , as discussed in  6 ,  even strongly variable and beamed jets may be described by this model .",
    "the transfer equation is well - behaved in the limit @xmath2 when it is formulated for radiation intensity in the fluid frame ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "this frame is comoving with the outflow at any radius @xmath3 .",

    "when the outflow carries no positrons , @xmath21 remains constant with radius .",
    "it also remains constant if positron creation is balanced by annihilation ( this situation takes place in collisionally heated jets , see b10 ) .",
    "besides the simpler form of the transfer equation , the ultra - relativistic regime implies a principal change in the formulation of the transfer problem .",
    "radiation in the lab frame is strongly collimated and essentially all photons stream outward .",

    "the high - energy photons make a negligible contribution to the number intensity @xmath67 , so it is sufficient to consider scattering by the thermal plasma with temperature ( [ eq : theta_e ] ) , which strongly dominates the optical depth .",

    "the timescale for dynamical relaxation toward @xmath221 is shorter than the outflow expansion timescale .",
    "this means that the outflow maintains @xmath224 and @xmath225 .    in this regime",

    "it is straightforward to verify that equation  ( [ eq : sol ] ) is the solution of equations  ( [ eq : i_th ] ) and ( [ eq : q_th ] ) .",

    "the angle of a photon propagating from @xmath232 to @xmath233 satisfies the equation of a straight line , @xmath235 . using @xmath236 and doppler transformation @xmath237 ( where @xmath238 $ ] when @xmath2 )",

    "thus , @xmath248 for each photon .",
    "together with @xmath249 this implies @xmath241 .",
    "the existence of a frame ( fluid frame ) where radiation remains isotropic and scattering is coherent implies that scattering has no effect on radiation , i.e. the transfer occurs as if radiation propagated in vacuum .",
    "indeed , consider the basic transfer equation  ( [ eq : transfer ] ) in the lab frame .",
    "coherent isotropic scattering in the fluid frame gives @xmath250 , which implies @xmath251 in the lab frame and hence @xmath252 .",
    "thus , radiation intensity in the lab frame remains constant along the ray , just like propagation in vacuum .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of radiation is preserved and its beaming angle decreases as @xmath253 .",
    "the corresponding solution for the intensity in the fluid frame can be obtained by the doppler transformation @xmath254 ( appendix  a ) of the vacuum solution for @xmath255 .",

    "this is a special feature of the ultra - relativistic transfer in spherical geometry .",

( 2 ) since both radiation and fluid move outward with almost speed of light , the radial diffusion of radiation relative to the fluid is inefficient on scales @xmath261 where @xmath262 . to a first approximation ,",
    "each `` elementary pancake '' of volume @xmath263 in the lab frame has its own radiative transfer and produces photospheric emission almost independently from the neighboring pancakes .",
    "if strong inhomogeneities of the jet are confined to scales much larger than @xmath264 and @xmath265 ( in the radial and transverse directions , respectively ) , radiative transfer in each pancake occurs as if it were part of a steady , spherically symmetric outflow .",
    "the independence of emissions from different pancakes can be better quantified if one considers the photon exchange between two pancakes separated by @xmath266 .",
    "the exchange is one - way only : the trailing pancake can receive photons from the leading pancake ( the opposite communication is impossible for @xmath266 ) .",
    "this `` trailing diffusion '' of radiation was studied by peer ( 2008 ) .",
    "he considered a very narrow shell of photons ( formally a delta - function of radius ) injected at a small @xmath3 in a steady jet with a constant lorentz factor .",
    "the photons diffuse through the jet and eventually escape , producing an isolated pulse of emission that will be received by a distant observer .",
    "the characteristic observed width of this pulse is @xmath267 , and it has an extended tail whose intensity decreases as @xmath268 .",
    "this implies that the trailing diffusion of radiation on scales @xmath266 is suppressed as @xmath269 .",
    "a realistic grb jet is continually filled with thermal radiation near the central engine .",
    "it may be viewed as a continual sequence of elementary pancakes that release their photons near @xmath161 .",
    "the strong doppler beaming implies that photospheric emission seen by a distant observer is dominated by a small patch @xmath270 on the sphere of radius @xmath271 .",
    "the observer receives radiation released by consecutive pancakes in the same order as they pass through @xmath161 .",
    "the observed timescale of passage of one elementary pancake through @xmath161 is @xmath272 , which may be smaller than 1  ms for grbs .",
    "the steady transfer model developed in this paper is valid for grbs with variability timescales @xmath273 .",
    "the model permits different @xmath161 for pancakes separated by timescales @xmath274 .",
    "this paper explored radiative transfer in ultra - relativistic outflows .",
    "the transfer problem is well defined and simplifies in the limit @xmath0 . in this limit",
    ", radiation propagating backward in the lab frame can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the transfer solution is independent of the outer boundary condition , in contrast to transfer in static media studied by chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) and sobolev ( 1963 ) .",
    "the problem is solved by direct integration of the transfer equation , with no need for iterations .",
    "the model with @xmath34 gives excellent approximation to transfer in outflows with finite @xmath36 .",
    "the approach developed in this paper gives a simple solution for the old problem of radiation - dominated jet discussed by paczyski ( 1986 ) and goodman ( 1986 ) .",
    "this jet is baryon - clean .",
    "it is very opaque at small radii because of the thermal population of @xmath18 pairs .",
    "almost all pairs annihilate at larger radii , and almost all the jet energy is carried by radiation that is released at the photosphere .",
    "paczyski and goodman considered the opaque zone of the radiation - dominated jet and derived its lorentz factor @xmath227 from energy - momentum conservation .",
    "they argued that quasi - thermal emission should be observed from the jet , with a spectral peak near 1  mev .",
    "they suggested , however , that the observed spectrum should be different from blackbody because of complicated transfer effects near the photosphere .",
    "goodman ( 1986 ) performed a numerical calculation with simplifying assumptions , which gave a nonblackbody spectrum .",
    "in fact , the exact transfer solution for this problem gives precisely blackbody spectrum .",
    "as shown in  5 , photons in a radiation - dominated jet are transferred as if there were no scattering at all .",
    "the radiation remains isotropic in the fluid frame which accelerates as @xmath227 both inside and outside the photosphere .",
    "a distant observer can think that radiation freely propagates from the central engine of the jet .",
    "and the equilibrium density of pairs drops below the density of photons . in this region",
    ", radiation receives significant energy from the annihilated pairs , which boosts its density by the factor of 11/4 ( similar to what happens in the expanding universe ) . after this transition",
    "the jet is still extremely opaque due to the remaining ( exponentially reduced ) @xmath18 population , and the radiation remains planckian . ]",
    "note also that regardless of how strong dissipation / heating may occur in the jet it does not have a dramatic impact on the shape of the spectral peak , because the energy budget of heating is negligible compared with the planck radiation .",
    "the observed radiation should have a blackbody spectrum .",
    "the opposite , `` matter - dominated '' regime was considered by paczyski ( 1990 ) . in the opaque zone radiation cools adiabatically and the jet energy becomes dominated by baryons .",
    "then it continues inertial expansion ( coasting ) with some relict thermal radiation in it until the radiation is released at the photosphere .    in the matter - dominated regime",
    ", the photospheric spectrum can not have the blackbody shape , even if the outflow cools passively , with no heating , up to the photosphere .",
    "b10 showed that the photospheric spectrum in the soft x - ray band has the slope @xmath275 instead of the blackbody ( rayleigh - jeans ) slope @xmath276 .",
    "moreover , collisional heating in grb jets transforms the photospheric spectrum into the band - type radiation , with extended high - energy emission instead of the exponential cutoff above 1  mev .",
    "thus , the photospheric spectrum of a matter - dominated jet is changed from blackbody both below and above the mev peak .",
    "besides giving a non - blackbody spectrum , the radiative transfer in matter - dominated jets has other interesting features .",
    "radiation becomes strongly anisotropic in the fluid frame well before it decouples from the fluid .",
    "radiation at the characteristic photospheric radius @xmath161 has the beaming factor @xmath277 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "beaming affects the adiabatic cooling of photons in the subphotospheric region .",
    "the net cooling factor for radiation emitted at a radius @xmath140 equals @xmath278 .    in a heated jet , adiabatic cooling of radiation",
    "is counter - balanced ( or dominated ) by comptonization , so the mean photon energy can grow with radius .",
    "this has a strong effect on the transfer solution for the radiation intensity .",
    "however , if one focuses on the transfer of photon number ( rather than energy ) , the results are not sensitive to heating .",
    "the photon - number intensity @xmath87 in the passively cooling and heated jets is very similar ( the difference is @xmath211% ) . in both cases , @xmath87 is strongly beamed in the subphotospheric region ( fig .",
    "as discussed in  7.1 , photospheric emission in grbs can have a blackbody spectrum only when the photosphere is dominated by radiation ( i.e. @xmath229 at @xmath260 ) .",
    "the detection of a blackbody component in a grb spectrum would provide clear evidence that part of the photospheric emission is in the radiation - dominated regime .",
    "the existing data are inconclusive .",
    "it includes grb  090902b that was much discussed recently as a burst with a blackbody component .",
    "in fact , it is equally well fitted by the band function plus a power law ( ryde et al .",
    "the data interpretation is further complicated by the variability of photospheric emission .",
    "it may vary on very short timescales , as short as @xmath279 , which can be smaller than one millisecond for a typical grb .",
    "the achieved temporal resolution of spectral analysis is far worse than 1  ms and may not give the true instantaneous photospheric spectrum .",
    "the photospheric emission may quickly switch between the radiation - dominated and matter - dominated regimes and these variations would remain undetected .",
    "the low - energy slopes of the observed grb spectra , @xmath280 , are affected by the time averaging , which tends to reduce @xmath280 .",
    "bursts with largest @xmath280 are most promising for detecting the blackbody component . in some cases ,",

    "radiation remains unpolarized in radiation - dominated jets (  5 ) .",
    "in contrast , in matter - dominated jets , radiation acquires a strong linear polarization in the photospheric region (  4.1 ) .",
    "an ideal detector that has enough angular resolution to image the spherically - symmetric outflow on scales @xmath282 would detect the polarization . in practice , such a high angular resolution is not achieved .",
