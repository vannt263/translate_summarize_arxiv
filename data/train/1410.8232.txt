    "the belle experiment is a multitasking magnetic spectrometer that operated for more than a decade at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath2 collider . before closing down in june 2010 to make way for its upgrade ( belle ii ) ,",
    "it has succeeded in collecting a world - record sample of data over @xmath3 near various @xmath4 resonances .",
    "we present herein a sample of recent interesting results from belle based on its full statistics .",
    "under weak interaction a flavored neutral meson can be represented as a two - state quantum system , leading to possible transition between the two states . the phenomenon going by the name _",
    "neutral meson mixing _ is intimately related to the difference between the flavor and mass eigenstates of the meson - antimeson system .",
    "such mixing is already well established for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the observed mixing rates are consistent with the standard model ( sm ) predictions that depend on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite elements , appearing in the short - distance box diagrams for mixing . for @xmath8 mesons",
    "the box diagrams are , however , both cabibbo and gim  @xcite suppressed giving rise to a small contribution .",
    "consequently , @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing is dominated by long - distance processes that are difficult to calculate .",
    "theoretical estimates for the mixing parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 range over two to three orders of magnitude  @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mass and decay width differences between the two @xmath14 mass eigenstates , and @xmath15 is their average decay width .",
    "violation of charge - parity ( @xmath1 ) symmetry in the charm sector provides an interesting test for new physics ( np ) as the sm predicts a very small asymmetry owing to : a ) large cabibbo and gim suppression , similar to mixing , and b ) a lack of large hierarchy in the down - type quark masses . among various @xmath14 decay modes the singly cabibbo - suppressed ( scs )",
    "decays constitute the most promising candidate to probe @xmath1 violation  @xcite with typical sm values are of the order of @xmath16 . with respect to such percentage effects",
    "one needs a good control on the theory prediction , something that is in general lacking in the charm sector due to long - distance effects .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing being firmly established ( see below ) one would like to explore possible @xmath1 violation in mixing or due to interference between mixing and decay amplitudes .",
    "we search for @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing in @xmath17 decays  @xcite by taking a ratio of the time - dependent rate of the wrong - sign ( ws ) decay @xmath18 to that of the right - sign ( rs ) decay @xmath19 .",
    "the rs and ws processes are identified via the decay chain @xmath20 , where one compares the charge of the slow pion @xmath21 with that of the pion arising from the @xmath14 decay .",
    "if the two are the same , it would be a rs decay ; else , a ws decay .",
    "the rs amplitude is dominated by a cabibbo - favored ( cf ) decay @xmath19 with a negligible contribution from @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing followed by a doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) decay @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , for the ws case the two contributing amplitudes , from the dcs decay @xmath23 and @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing followed by the cf decay @xmath24 , are of similar magnitude . the time - dependent ratio of ws to rs decay rates is thus given by @xmath25 to the second order in mixing parameters . here",
    ", @xmath26 is the proper decay time , @xmath27 is the average @xmath8 lifetime , @xmath28 is the ratio of dcs to cf decay rates , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the `` rotated '' mixing parameters with @xmath31 being the strong phase difference between the dcs and cf decay amplitudes .",
    ".results of the time - dependent fit to @xmath32 , where dof denotes the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the uncertainties are statistical and systematic combined . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the @xmath33 decay , a typical scs one , is expected to exhibit large @xmath1 violation in several np models such as those with large chromomagnetic dipole operators  @xcite and the triplet model  @xcite .",
    "the enhanced @xmath1 asymmetry value could lie anywhere between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "further motivation for our study came from an early measurement by lhcb  @xcite , supported by cdf  @xcite , suggesting a @xmath36 effect on the difference of direct @xmath1 asymmetries ( @xmath37 ) between @xmath38 and @xmath39 decays . though the current world average for @xmath37 stands",
    "@xmath40 away from zero  @xcite , there exists a good deal of theoretical motivation  @xcite to look for @xmath1 violation in @xmath33 .",
    "experimentally , the previous result from cleo  @xcite was consistent with zero with an uncertainty of @xmath41  as big as the np prediction .",
    "we measure the time - integrated @xmath1 asymmetry in the @xmath33 and @xmath42 decays  @xcite using @xmath43 of data collected with belle . in the process",
    "@xmath44 coming from @xmath45 , the charge of the low - momentum or `` slow '' pion @xmath46 determines the flavor of the neutral charm meson ( whether it is a @xmath8 or a @xmath9 ) .",
    "the measured asymmetry @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of reconstructed events tagged as @xmath49 , has three contributions : the underlying @xmath1 asymmetry @xmath50 , the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath51 ) due to @xmath52-@xmath53 interference in @xmath54 and higher - order qed processes , and the detection asymmetry between positively and negatively charged pions ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we subtract the @xmath56 measured in the cf decay @xmath19 ( `` untagged '' ) from @xmath57 ( `` tagged '' ) to estimate @xmath55 .",
    "the implicit assumption here is that both @xmath58 and @xmath14 mesons have the same @xmath51 value . after correcting for @xmath55 ,",
    "one is left with @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath61 polar angle in the center of mass ( cm ) frame . while @xmath50 is independent of kinematics",
    ", @xmath51 is an odd function of @xmath62 . making use of this important distinction",
    ", we obtain @xmath63/2 $ ] and @xmath64/2 $ ] .    based on a total signal yield of @xmath65 @xmath33 events , we obtain @xmath66\\%$ ] , which improves over the previous results  @xcite by an order of magnitude and shows no hint for @xmath1 violation",
    ". we also measure @xmath67\\%$ ] , which supersedes belle s earlier result  @xcite . after subtracting @xmath1 violation due to @xmath5-@xmath68 mixing ,",
    "the @xmath1 asymmetry for @xmath69 is found to be @xmath70 , again consistent with no @xmath1 violation .",
    "the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transition @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is forbidden at tree level in the sm .",
    "however , it can occur at higher order via electroweak loop ( penguin ) and @xmath74 box diagrams .",
    "the corresponding decay amplitudes are expressed in terms of the effective wilson coefficients  @xcite : @xmath75 for the electromagnetic penguin , @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the vector and axial - vector electroweak contributions , respectively  @xcite . in presence of np contributions",
    ", these coefficients are expected to differ from sm predictions , leading to a dramatic change in the decay rate and angular distributions of the @xmath78 transition  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the lepton forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath71 decays , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the angle between the @xmath81 and the @xmath0 meson momentum in the @xmath82 cm frame and @xmath83 is a hadronic system containing an @xmath84 quark , exhibits an excellent sensitivity for physics beyond the sm .    motivated by this , we perform the first measurement of @xmath51 in the inclusive @xmath71 decays as a function of the dilepton invariant mass squared @xmath85  @xcite , using @xmath86 @xmath87 pairs collected at the @xmath88 resonance . by inclusive here",
    "one means a sum of several exclusive hadronic final states representing the @xmath83 system .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath0 mesons in @xmath89 hadronic final states with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 of which at most one pion can be neutral , together with two oppositely charged leptons ( electrons or muons ) . in case of @xmath6 ( @xmath93 )",
    "decays , only self - tagging modes with a @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) are utilized .",
    "signal events are identified with two kinematic variables , calculated in the @xmath88 rest frame : the beam - energy constrained mass @xmath96 and the energy difference @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the beam energy , and ( @xmath99 ) are the reconstructed energy and momentum of the @xmath0-meson candidate . to reduce contamination from the @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) continuum background",
    ", we use a neural network mostly based event topology and @xmath0 vertex - fit quality .",
    "charmonia contributions from @xmath102 $ ] with @xmath103\\to\\ell^+\\ell^-$ ] , are suppressed by rejecting ( `` vetoing '' ) events with a dilepton invariant mass in the following two ranges : @xmath104 to @xmath105 ( @xmath106 to @xmath107 ) and @xmath106 to @xmath107 ( @xmath108 to @xmath107 ) around the nominal @xmath109 and @xmath110 mass  @xcite mass for the electron ( muon ) channel .    in total , @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath114 signal candidates are selected in the data sample . to study the @xmath115 dependence of @xmath51 , we divide the data into four @xmath115 bins : @xmath116 $ ] , @xmath117 $ ] , @xmath118 $ ] , and @xmath119{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{\\,ge\\kern -0.1em v^{2}\\!/}c^4}}\\xspace}$ ] for the electron ( muon ) channel , where the gap regions correspond to the veto described earlier .",
    "the @xmath51 value is found to be consistent with the sm prediction in the two intermediate @xmath115 bins , while it deviates from the sm in the lowest @xmath115 bin by @xmath120 ( including the systematic uncertainty ) .",
    "results in the last two bins exclude @xmath121 at a @xmath40 level .",
    "the @xmath122 decay proceeds via the @xmath123 penguin and cabibbo - suppressed @xmath124 tree diagrams .",
    "there is a destructive interference between two contributing amplitudes leading to a small decay branching fraction",
    ". the interference pattern could also give rise to a large direct @xmath1 violation .",
    "typical branching fraction values calculated within the framework of perturbative qcd  @xcite , qcd factorization  @xcite , soft collinear effective theory  @xcite and @xmath125 flavor symmetry  @xcite are in the range @xmath126@xmath127 . in the past ,",
    "belle  @xcite and @xmath128  @xcite have searched for @xmath122 with the latter reporting the first evidence at a @xmath129 level .",
    "so far , @xmath1 violation has not been probed in the decay .",
    "we search for @xmath122  @xcite using a data sample of @xmath86 @xmath87 pairs recorded at the @xmath88 resonance .",
    "the decay candidates are reconstructed from the subsequent decay modes @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 . based on an extended maximum likelihood fit to their distributions of @xmath133 , @xmath134 , continuum suppression variable , and the cosine of the @xmath135 helicity angle , we extract a signal yield of @xmath136 events with a significance of @xmath137 , including systematic uncertainties .",
    "this constitutes the first observation of the decay channel .",
    "the yield is translated to a branching fraction @xmath138=[2.6\\pm 0.7{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{(stat)}}\\xspace}\\pm0.2{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{(syst)}}\\xspace}]\\times10^{-6}$ ] , in a good agreement with theory predictions .",
    "we also measure direct @xmath1 violation by splitting the obtained yield according to the flavor of the @xmath0 meson , based on the sign of the daughter kaon from the @xmath135 decay .",
    "the obtained result , @xmath139 , is consistent with no @xmath1 violation .",
    "recently , a number of new charmonium - like states have been observed at the @xmath0 factories and elsewhere .",
    "some of them especially the charged ones look very much like exotic , defying predictions of the quark model .",
    "the first one in the series , the @xmath141 , was discovered by belle in the @xmath142 invariant mass spectrum in @xmath143  @xcite , followed by two more states , the @xmath144 and @xmath145 , in @xmath146 decays  @xcite .",
    "lately , besiii has joined the game by observing @xmath147 in the @xmath148 invariant mass spectrum in @xmath149  @xcite . in a back - to - back publication",
    "@xcite , belle corroborated the finding .",
    "motivated by these exciting results , we perform an amplitude analysis  @xcite of the decay @xmath150 , with @xmath151 or @xmath2 , using a data sample of @xmath86 @xmath87 pairs . our analysis strategy is similar to a recent study of @xmath143  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the known @xmath141 state , we find a new charmonium - like state @xmath152 in the @xmath148 invariant mass spectrum with a significance exceeding @xmath153 .",
    "the minimal quark content of this state is exotic : @xmath154 .",
    "its mass and decay width are measured to be @xmath155 { \\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{\\,me\\kern -0.1em v\\!/}c^2}}\\xspace}$ ] and @xmath156{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{\\,me\\kern -0.1em v}}}\\xspace}$ ] , respectively .",
    "the preferred spin - parity quantum numbers are @xmath157 .",
    "though close to five years have passed by since its data taking , belle continues to produce high quality results .",
    "a small sample of those based on the full statistics are presented here .",
