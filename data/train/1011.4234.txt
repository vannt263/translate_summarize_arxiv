    "if the typical number of rejections can be kept small and an explicit analytical expression for @xmath6 can not be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : t - selection ] ) , the ata should become favorable in comparison to the rta .",

    "overall one can view the procedure implied by the fata as that each state @xmath30 has a next attempt time @xmath28 ( with @xmath76 if the system is in state @xmath3 ) and that the next attempt is made to the target state with the minimal @xmath28 . after each attempt ,",
    "updates of some of the @xmath28 are made as described above in dependence of whether the attempt was rejected or accepted .    in order to prove that the fata gives the @xmath77 from eq .",
