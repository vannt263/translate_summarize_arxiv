    "these spectra have similarities to the spectra for the stokes field  ( fig .  [ fig4]b ) .",
    "note that the formula like eq .",
    "( [ 46 ] ) shows that the quadrature spectra are determined by the interference of the stokes and antistokes terms .",
    "the reason is that in the region of interest in the spectrum @xmath184 , the term @xmath188 is approximately flat .",

    "the splittings of the resonances separated by @xmath189 appear in the dashed curves in fig .",
    "the splittings are due to the enhanced coupling strength by the increasing photon number in the cavities , which induced normal mode splitting of the cavity states .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how the asymmetric fano line shapes can arise in optomechanics .",
    "we identify interfering pathways leading to the fano resonances .",
    "in contrast to atomic systems , the coupling field can be used to tune fano resonances using both the frequency and the power of coupling field .",
    "in fact , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b the coupling field opens up another coherent path way .",
    "we give explicit expressions for the width and the asymmetry parameter .",
    "the fano resonances can be studied both via pump probe experiment and via the study of the quantum fluctuations in the output fields .",
