    "the stability of nuclei in superheavy mass region was predicted in mid sixties @xcite when shell correction was added to the liquid drop binding energy and the possible shell closure was pointed out at z=114 and n=184 .",
    "myers and swiatecki @xcite concluded that the half - lives of nuclei near the shell closures must be long enough to get observed . in other words , nuclei with zero shell effects would not be stable and decay immediately , as was predicted by macroscopic liquid drop models for z@xmath2100 nuclides .",
    "recentally , however , the spectroscopic studies of the nuclei beyond z=100 have become possible @xcite , and the heaviest nucleus studied so far in this series of experiments @xcite is @xmath3no ( z=102 , n=152 ) .",
    "thus , the progress in experimental techniques has drawn our attention and opened up the field once again for further theoretical investigations in structure physics of nuclei in the superheavy mass region .",
    "even though , experimentally , the elements upto z=118 have been synthesized to - date , with half - lives varying from few minutes to milliseconds @xcite , the above mentioned theoretically predicted center of island of stability could not be located precisely . recently ,",
    "more microscopic theoretical calculations have predicted various other regions of stability , namely , z=120 , n=172 or 184 @xcite and z=124 or 126 , n=184 @xcite .",
    "apparently , there is a need to design the new experiments to solve the outstanding problem of locating the precise island of stability for superheavy elements . in an effort in this direction , using inductively coupled plasma - sector field mass spectroscopy , marinov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have observed some neutron - deficient th isotopes in naturally occuring thorium substances .",
    "long - lived isomeric states , with estimated half - lives @xmath410@xmath5 y , have been identified in the neutron - deficient @xmath6th isotopes , which are associated with the superdeformed ( sd ) or hyperdeformed ( hd ) states ( minimma ) in potential energy surfaces ( pes ) . in a similar search for long - lived , trans - actinides in natural materials , more recently , these authors @xcite obtained a possible evidence for the existence of a long - lived superheavy nucleus with mass number a=292 and atomic number z=122 in natural thorium . the half life is again estimated to be the same as above , i.e. @xmath410@xmath5 y and abundance ( 1 - 10)@xmath710@xmath8 relative to @xmath9th .",
    "this possibility of an extremely heavey z nucleus motivated us to see the structures of such nuclei in an isotopic mass chain .",
    "therefore , based on the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) and non - relativistic skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) methods , we calculated the bulk proporties of z=122 nucleus in an isotopic chain of mass a=282 - 320 .",

    "these nuclei are unstable , because of the repulsive coulomb force , but the attractive nuclear shell effects come to their resque , making the superheavy element possible to be synthesized , particularly when a combination of magic proton and neutron number happens to occur ( largest shell correction ) . in order to take care of the pairing effects in these nuclei , we use the constant gap for proton and neutron , as given in @xcite : @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath46=5.72 , @xmath47=0.118 , @xmath48= 8.12 , @xmath49=1 , and @xmath50 .",

    "it is found that , more or less , most of the recent parameter sets reproduce well the ground state properties , not only of stable normal nuclei but also of exotic nuclei which are far away from the valley of @xmath43-stability .",
