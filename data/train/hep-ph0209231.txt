    "several areas of research in elementary particle physics ( as well as nuclear physics and astrophysics ) require information about the long - distance nature of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . sometimes this information can be gleaned from experiment , but often what one needs , in practice , are _ ab initio _ calculations of the properties of hadrons . in some cases",
    "one aims for a detailed understanding of qcd in its own right . in others ,",
    "one simply requires a reliable calculation of hadronic properties , so that one can study electroweak interactions or new phenomena at short distances .",
    "mathematical physicists tell us that the best way to define gauge theories , including qcd , is to start with a space - time lattice .",
    "the spacing between sites is usually called @xmath1 . if the finite grid has @xmath2 sites , then one has a finite box size , @xmath3 , and finite extent in time , @xmath4 .",
    "quarks are described by lattice fermion fields located at the sites , denoted  @xmath5 ; gluons are described by lattice gauge fields located on the _ links _ from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , denoted  @xmath8 .",
    "the key advantage to the lattice is that local gauge invariance is simple .",
    "the fields transform  as @xmath9 so it is easy to devise gauge invariant actions , _",
    "i.e. _ , independent of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "if one imagines a smooth underlying gauge potential  @xmath11 ( as is used in continuum qcd ) , the relation to the lattice gauge field is @xmath12 continuum qcd is defined from lattice qcd by taking @xmath13 with @xmath14 and hadron masses fixed .",
    "then one takes the infinite volume limit , @xmath15 .",
    "if one is interested in the chiral limit , @xmath16 , it should be taken last .",
    "these limits are nothing radical : the lattice provides an ultraviolet cutoff , and the finite volume an infrared cutoff .",
    "the existence of these limits has not been proven rigorously , but , because of asymptotic freedom , there is not much doubt that this procedure works .",
    "( if not , why does qcd work at all ? ) the lattice formulation makes field theory mathematically similar to statistical mechanics and , consequently , provides new tools . for example , a finite lattice makes it possible to integrate the functional integral by monte carlo methods .",
    "the expectation value of observable  @xmath17 may be written @xmath18 where @xmath19 is chosen so that @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is an abbreviation for all fields , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the right - most expression is a numerical approximation , with the sum running over some set of field configurations .",
    "this numerical technique , though only one facet of lattice gauge theory , is what most particle physicists mean by `` lattice qcd . ''",
    "so , this talk is about tools need to make numerical calculations more reliable , and the progress being made in calculations needed to interpret `` physics in collision . ''",
    "it is not so easy to descend from the mathematical high ground down to realistic , practical numerical calculations .",
    "difficulties arise because qcd is a multi - scale problem .",
    "nature has not only the characteristic scale of qcd , @xmath25 , but also a wide range of quark masses , leading to a hierarchy @xmath26 as a dynamical scale , rather than a parameter , there is a range for the qcd scale .",
    "some benchmarks include the scale in the running coupling @xmath27  mev , typical hadron masses like @xmath28  mev , and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath29  mev .",
    "the strange quark , with @xmath30  mev , is light , and the up and down quarks , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are especially light .",
    "the bottom quark , with @xmath33  gev , is heavy , and the top quark , with @xmath34  gev , is especially heavy .",
    "one can argue whether the charmed quark , with @xmath35  gev , is heavy or not .",
    "cutoffs are needed to put the problem on a computer , and they introduce two more scales .",
    "the idealized hierarchy is now @xmath36 it is impractical to expect a huge separation of scales in computational physics . to explain why",
    ", some simple scaling laws are helpful .",
    "the memory required grows like @xmath37 , and these large exponents come because we live in @xmath38 space - time dimensions .",
    "the cpu time needed to update gauge fields in the monte carlo scales like @xmath39 , where @xmath40  or  @xmath41 , and the 4 again comes from the dimension of space - time .",
    "the cpu time needed to compute quark propagators scales like @xmath42 where @xmath43@xmath44 .",
    "the exponents @xmath45 and @xmath46 are non - zero because of properties of our numerical algorithms , and it seems difficult to reduce them .",
    "the first consequence of these scaling laws is that @xmath47 can be larger , but not much larger , than  @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be smaller , but not much smaller .",
    "a  more important consequence is that improved methodology pays off enormously .",
    "for example , @xmath50 physics with @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 saves a factor @xmath53 in computing .",
    "such improvements are not attained by cpu power , but through new ideas . moreover , in computational physics the need for creativity means that computing facilities must be flexible , not just  big .",
    "so , we see that finite computer resources force us to consider the hierarchy @xmath54 instead of the idealized one",
    ". one should emphasize that we know how to get from the practical hierarchy  ( [ eq : practical ] ) to physical results .",
    "the central idea is to let the computer work on dynamics at the scale @xmath25 , and to use effective field theories to get the rest .",
    "the computer runs , by necessity , with finite cutoffs and artificial quark masses . with effective field theories ,",
    "one can strip off the artifice , and replace it with the real world . in doing so , one introduces theoretical uncertainties , but effective field theories control the error analysis .",
    "a more thorough exposition of this line of thinking can be found in a recent review  @xcite . here",
    "let us emphasize the role of effective field theories by listing some of the big ideas in lattice of the last several years :    * static limit and lattice nrqcd to treat heavy quarks * understanding lattice perturbation theory ( to match at short distances ) * non - perturbative implementation of the symanzik effective field theory * continuum hqet to control heavy - quark discretization effects * novel applications of chiral perturbation theory * understanding chiral symmetry in lattice gauge theory    all but the last explicitly bring in effective field theories , and it resonates with the usage of chiral perturbation theory to extrapolate light quark masses .",
    "the exception to the rule of effective field theory is something called the quenched approximation .",
    "quenched qcd is a model , so the associated uncertainty is difficult to estimate . for example , unquenched ( usually @xmath55 not  3 ) calculations of hadron masses , decay constants , etc .",
    ", suggest changes of 020% .",
    "fortunately , the quenched approximation is going away . within a few years",
    ", i imagine that quenched calculations will no longer play an important role in our thinking about non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the rest of this paper looks at some calculations needed to interpret current and future experiments .",
    "moments of structure functions can help obtain better parton densities and , hence , better predictions of cross sections at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "lattice calculations of these moments are covered in sec .",
    "[ sec : moments ] . in flavor physics ,",
    "the focus of many experiments , there is a pressing need for the hadronic matrix elements needed in leptonic and semi - leptonic decays , and neutral meson mixing .",
    "there are many of these , and sec .",
    "[ sec : flavor ] covers only a subset : form factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 to obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 from @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; and matrix elements for neutral @xmath50 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 oscillations , need to constrain  @xmath64 .",
    "section  [ sec : end ] concludes with a summary and some thoughts about the future .",
    "the rate for deeply inelastic @xmath65 scattering ( dis ) depends on several structure functions , which we shall generically denote  @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath6 is the momentum fraction of the struck parton , @xmath67 . in perturbative qcd",
    ", the @xmath68s can be related to process - independent parton densities , which are used to predict cross sections for @xmath69 and @xmath70 collisions .",

    "modern methods for parton densities directly reflect the lack of information  @xcite .",
    "they need independent ( but qcd - based ) knowledge of the moments to constrain  @xmath66 for @xmath73 .",
    "the operator product expansion relates the moments to local operators , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a short - distance wilson coefficient that is calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "the matrix element on the right - hand side should be `` easy '' to calculate : just find a lattice operator @xmath76 with the same quantum numbers as @xmath77 and calculate the matrix element at several different lattice spacings .",
    "we have a detailed description of lattice - spacing effects , namely , @xmath78 based on an effective field theory introduced by symanzik two decades ago  @xcite .",
    "differences between lattice gauge theory , with @xmath79 , and continuum qcd arise at short distances comparable to  @xmath1 .",
    "they are lumped into short - distance coefficients @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . the operators on the right - hand side are , in the symanzik effective field theory , defined with a continuum renormalization .",
    "thus , in addition to calculating the left - hand side , to obtain @xmath83 one must also compute the normalization factor @xmath80 and cope with the terms of order  @xmath1 .    we know how to calculate @xmath80 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "they depend on details of the lattice lagrangian and the lattice operator @xmath76 .",
    "one can introduce parameters ( call them @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) that directly influence @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , one can adjusted @xmath86 and @xmath87 until @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this procedure is called symanzik improvement  @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to compute the @xmath19s and @xmath63s .",
    "one is renormalized perturbation theory , which works because the @xmath19s and @xmath63s are short - distance quantities . in this method ,",
    "uncertainties of order @xmath90 remain .",
    "usually , these days , only one - loop calculations are available , so @xmath91 .",
    "then it is helpful to apply the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie prescription  @xcite to sum up higher - order terms related to renormalization parts .",
    "the other method is fully non - perturbative  @xcite .",
    "this sounds as if it is exact , but there are uncertainties in the @xmath63s of order @xmath1 . for the matrix element itself ,",
    "this is just another error of order  @xmath92 , of which there are many .",
    "the first method has been used by the qcdsf collaboration  @xcite , who have rather comprehensive results for the proton .",
    "the second method has been used by a zeuthen - roma  ii collaboration  @xcite , for the first moment of the pion structure function .",
    "the quenched results from qcdsf do not agree especially well with phenomenology .",
    "it is , of course , tempting ( and reasonable ) to blame the quenched approximation .",
    "till now , one could also blame the phenomenological result , which gets a significant contribution from the high-@xmath6 region , where there are no experimental data . as it turns out , neither is the main culprit .",
    "earlier this year the lhpc and sesam collaborations finished a comparison of quenched and unquenched ( well , @xmath55 ) calculations of many proton moments  @xcite . to save computer time ,",
    "these calculations are done with artificially large light quark mass ( for the reasons explained above ) .",

    "it has a pronounced curvature for small quarks masses , of the form @xmath94 ( and @xmath95 ) . with chiral perturbation theory",
    ", the extrapolated result agrees with phenomenology .",
    "the central question in flavor physics is whether the standard ckm mechanism explains all flavor and @xmath0 violation ( in the quark sector ) .",
    "one angle on this question is over - constraint of the ckm matrix . because the ckm matrix has only four free parameters , the magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements dictate the @xmath0 violating phase .",
    "many of the magnitudes may be obtained from semi - leptonic decays , such as @xmath96 for the cabibbo angle , @xmath60 for @xmath58 , and @xmath61 for @xmath59 .",
    "ckm elements on the third row ( involving the top quark ) enter through neutral meson mixing , in the neutral @xmath63 , @xmath50 , and @xmath62 systems . here",

    "the symanzik effective field theory , at least as usually applied , breaks down .",
    "lattice gauge theory does not break down , however , and the isgur - wise heavy - quark symmetries emerge , in the usual way , for all @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath102 , lattice gauge theory can be described by heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "one can write  @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 means `` has the same matrix elements as . '' in the same way @xmath105 the difference is in the short - distance coefficients @xmath106 . on the lattice",

    "( [ eq : hqetlat ] ) and  ( [ eq : hqetcont ] ) are essentially the same",
    ".    one can therefore systematically improve lattice calculations of @xmath99-flavored hadrons , by matching lattice gauge theory and continuum qcd such that @xmath110 for the first several operators .",
    "hqet is , here , merely an analysis tool ; details of how hqet is defined and renormalized drop out of the difference .",
    "these ideas are put to direct use in the fermilab method  @xcite , which is based on wilson fermions and , thus , also possesses a smooth continuum limit .",

    "the other is the formulation of lattice fermions with good chiral symmetry  @xcite . with these new tools",
    ", we may be able to obtain , at last , quantitative results for such long - standing problems as the @xmath207 rule and the matrix elements needed to compute @xmath208 in the standard model .",
    "@xcite ( and earlier papers by lscher ) base a formalism for calculating final - state phases on three insights .",
    "the first is that energy levels in finite volumes are discrete .",
    "the second is that phase shifts arise at hadronic distances of order 1  fm , remote from the box size @xmath209  fm .",
    "lastly , there is a kinematical , albeit very non - trivial , set of @xmath14-dependent relationships between the phase shifts and the energy levels . as a result",
    ", one can extract the ( elastic ) phase shifts from the @xmath14 dependence of the discrete energy spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , practical application to qcd requires box sizes @xmath210@xmath211 , so it will not be feasible soon .    in many kaonic matrix elements , chiral symmetry is important , for example for maintaining a simple relation between lattice operators and their counterparts in continuum qcd . in 1982",
    "ginsparg and wilson derived a sufficient condition for chiral symmetry on the lattice  @xcite . for a long time the ginsparg - wilson relation defied solution , buy now there are at least two realizations , the `` fixed - point action ''  @xcite , and `` overlap fermions ''  @xcite .",
    "another method , `` domain - wall fermions ''  @xcite , is related to the former and has exponentially small violations of the ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "two lattice collaborations have large - scale calculations of  @xmath205 ( defined analogously to @xmath212 ) with domain - wall quarks . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mix ] , published results from cp - pacs  @xcite and rbc  @xcite are compared to classic work of jlqcd ( with kogut - susskind quarks )  @xcite .",
    "the lattice spacing dependence seems gentler for domain - wall fermions . from looking at the plot ,",
    "a rough estimate of an average would be @xmath213 which encompasses also ref .",
    "this uncertainty could easily be reduced , by using , say , 35 lattice spacings with domain - wall ( or overlap ) fermions , and taking the continuum limit .",
    "one should also keep in mind that these calculations have been done in the quenched approximation , and with degenerate quarks of mass  @xmath214 .",
    "although the foundation of lattice qcd is sound , some difficulties arise when turning the idealized theory into a computation tool .",
    "errors are introduced at short and long distances .",
    "they are controlled by effective field theories , however , providing reliable methods to obtain physical predictions .",
    "a  wide variety of calculations in the quenched approximation have allowed us to learn how control short - distance effects : both for light quarks and for heavy quarks .",
    "now that several ( partially ) unquenched calculations are available , other issues are becoming clearer , particularly the chiral extrapolation of light quark masses .",
    "one can be optimistic that unquenched calculations  with solid , transparent analyses of all uncertainties  will become available to help interpret experiments with high - energy collisions .",
    "one upcoming program is especially noteworthy vis a vis lattice qcd . in the next few years",
    ", cleo-@xmath155  @xcite will measure leptonic and semi - leptonic decays of @xmath154 and @xmath215 mesons to a few per  cent .",
    "lattice qcd has a chance to predict their results , perhaps with comparable accuracy .",
    "an especially interesting combination is @xmath216 ( and the cabibbo - suppressed cousin @xmath217 ) .",
    "the ckm matrix drops out from the measurements , and non - standard physics is unlikely .",
    "thus , one has direct tests of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the ratio @xmath218 is also interesting , because it tests the chiral extrapolation of  @xmath177 in @xmath50-@xmath219 mixing .",
    "successful comparisons of lattice calculations and cleo-@xmath155 will give confidence in other applications of lattice qcd , such as @xmath50 physics and moments of the parton densities .",
