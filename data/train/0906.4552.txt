    "we have few probes of the early universe and the first few generations of stars . we know that stars had to form early in order to pollute the universe with metals and reionize the universe .",
    "there is evidence that the universe was reionized at around @xmath9 , such as from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite .",
    "stars are efficient producers of ionizing photons , so are likely candidates for the bulk of reionization .",
    "these ultraviolet photons at redshifts @xmath10 would be redshifted into the near - infrared bands .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to search for this remnant light in the near infrared bands to learn about this early epoch of star formation and reionization @xcite .",
    "observations of the near infrared background ( nirb ) may indicate that there is an excess mean background above that normal galaxies can account for @xcite .",
    "in addition , there also appears to be a peak in the nirb spectrum at 12 @xmath11 , which could represent a lyman - cutoff signature @xcite . however , the interpretation of the current observational data , in particular accuracy of the subtraction of zodiacal light and foreground galaxies , is highly controversial @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , any detection or non - detection of this excess light could tell us properties of early stars .",
    "in addition to the mean intensity , fluctuations in the nirb can provide an additional source of information about the first generations of stars @xcite .",
    "fluctuations are in general easier to study than the mean intensity because an accurate determination of the zero point is not needed ; thus , they are less sensitive to the imperfect subtraction of zodiacal light . however , as the contribution to fluctuations from low redshift populations , i.e. , @xmath12 , can confuse the signal from higher redshift populations , the level of contamination from low redshift populations must be estimated and subtracted carefully @xcite .",
    "upcoming measurements with akari @xcite and ciber ( the cosmic infrared background experiment ) @xcite may be able to put a more solid constraint on what fraction of the nirb is from high redshift stars and galaxies .",
    "in the previous paper we have presented detailed theoretical calculations of the spectrum and metallicity / initial - mass - spectrum dependence of the mean intensity of nirb ( @xcite , hereafter fk06 ) . in this paper",
    "we present calculations of the power spectrum and metallicity / initial - mass - spectrum dependence of the nirb fluctuations , as well as dependence on the star formation efficiency and the escape fraction of ionizing photons . while the previous work in the literature @xcite relied solely on simplified analytical arguments , we use , for the first time , large - scale cosmological simulations of cosmic reionization given in @xcite , coupled with the analytical calculations given in fk06 , to predict the power spectrum of nirb fluctuations . in this way we are able to capture the contribution from ionized bubbles surrounding the halos , which has been ignored completely in the previous work .",
    "in   [ sec : simulations ] we outline the simulations @xcite and in   [ sec : analytical ] we explain the analytic formulas we use to obtain the luminosity of the halos and the surrounding igm . in   [ sec : lpk ] we present our calculation of the luminosity - density power spectrum , @xmath13 .",
    "predictions for @xmath13 and the angular power spectrum of nirb fluctuations , @xmath1 , are presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "various parameters effects on the results are discussed in   [ sec : varysection ] .",
    "we compare our results to the previous literature in   [ sec : compare ] and to observations in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we take a look at the constraints from the mean nirb in   [ sec : mean ] , and compute the fractional anisotropy , i.e. , the ratio of the power spectrum and the mean intensity squared , in   [ sec : fractional ] .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use simulations from @xcite , which are the first truly large scale simulations to include radiative transfer , and are therefore ideal for predicting the distribution of luminosities from high redshift stellar populations .",
    "simulations provide the advantage of being able to simultaneously model the distribution of halos and the density of the igm , as well as the ionization front that propagates through the igm .",
    "we combine this @xmath0-body code with radiative transfer and analytic formulas for luminosity to simulate their luminosity - density power spectrum .",
    "the particular simulation that we use in this paper is the run `` f250c '' in table i of @xcite , which was run with the cosmological parameters given by the wmap 3-year results @xcite , ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19)=(0.24 , 0.76 , 0.042 , 0.73 , 0.74 , 0.95 ) . aside from the cosmological parameters ,",
    "the only free parameter in the reionization simulation of this kind is the production rate of ionizing photons escaping into the igm per halo .",
    "we shall come back to this parameter , called @xmath20 , in   [ sec : massspectrum ] .",
    "these simulations combine a high resolution @xmath0-body code ( pmfast , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a radiative transfer code ( @xmath21-ray , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is a conservative , causal ray - tracing radiative transfer code .",
    "the @xmath21-ray code traces the ionization front by tracking photons using photon conservation .",
    "the code allows for large time steps and coarse grids without loss of accuracy .",
    "the box size of the simulation is 100@xmath22 mpc , which is large enough to sample the history , geometry , and statistical properties of reionization .",
    "the number of particles is @xmath23 , and the density field was sampled on a lattice of @xmath24 cells .",
    "the density field was then binned to @xmath25 cells for the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we use the @xmath25 cells when we compute the radiation from the igm in   [ sec : pligm ] .",
    "the minimum mass of the halos is @xmath26 , which represents dwarf galaxies .",
    "these halos have virial temperatures of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 respectively . for these halos",
    "the dominant cooling process is hydrogen atomic cooling .",
    "it is important to sample these dwarf galaxies , as they are far more numerous than larger galaxies and may provide most of the photons needed for reionization .    even though this simulation is a very powerful tool , it is important to consider its limitations .",
    "halos slightly below the resolution of this simulation ( @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xmath35 ) may also be an important source for ionizing radiation .",
    "@xcite also did a smaller box - size simulation [ ( 35@xmath22 mpc)@xmath36 that resolves halos down to @xmath37 , which includes halos that form stars as a result of atomic cooling .",
    "these smaller halos allow the ionization fraction to reach 50% at an earlier epoch than the simulations that only resolved down to @xmath26 .",
    "however , @xcite found that the redshift in which reionization was completed remained about the same for the 100@xmath22 mpc and 35@xmath22 mpc simulations , due to the `` self - regulation '' ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the results discussed in this paper are based on the larger box size with halos resolved down to @xmath26 .",
    "it is possible that the smaller halos would affect the fluctuations in the nirb from both the halos and the igm .",
    "future simulations will allow both a larger box size along with a smaller minimum mass .",
    "these future simulations will be able to provide more robust predictions for the fluctuations in the nirb if these smaller halos contribute to the nirb .",
    "simulations that resolve halos smaller than @xmath37 may not be needed , however : while these minihalos were likely the sites of the truly first generation of stars , they may not be a significant source of ionizing photons to reionize the universe , as uv photons in the lyman werner bands dissociate molecular hydrogen , terminating star formation in these small halos @xcite .",
    "however , there is on - going discussion as to what the radiation feedback actually does for the formation of second generation stars @xcite .",
    "while the lyman werner background from early star formation has a primarily negative feedback effect , other processes ( e.g. , cooling in supernova remnant shocks ) may mitigate the suppression of h2 molecules @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe how we assign the luminosity to the halos and the igm in the simulation . note that our method is fully analytical , and thus can be adopted to any other reionization simulations .",
    "luminosity within the halos is dominated by five radiative processes : stellar ( black - body ) emission , and the nebular emission including free - free , free - bound , and two - photon emission , as well as any emission lines ( here , lyman-@xmath38 is the most important one for our study of nirb ) .",
    "the luminosity of each component can be found analytically using the equations in fk06 .",
    "equations for the stars luminosity , temperature , number of ionizing photons per second , and lifetime were based on equations from table 3 of @xcite , which were fit from stellar models or fitting functions @xcite .",
    "first , let us define the `` volume emissivity . ''",
    "the volume emissivity ( luminosity per comoving volume per frequency ) , @xmath39 , is related to the `` emission coefficient '' ( luminosity per comoving volume per frequency per steradian ) , @xmath40 , in @xcite by @xmath41 .",
    "in other words , the luminosity is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the _ comoving _ volume element , and @xmath44 is the solid angle element .",
    "integrating @xmath39 over @xmath45 , one obtains the `` comoving luminosity density , '' @xmath46 , as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "when the main - sequence lifetime of stars under consideration is shorter than the time scale at which the star formation takes place , the volume emissivity is given by a product of the star formation rate ( the stellar mass density formed per unit time ) , @xmath49 , and the ratio of the mass - weighted average of the total radiative energy ( including stellar emission and reprocessed light ) emitted over the stellar lifetime to the stellar rest - mass energy , @xmath50 ( see eq .",

    "note that @xmath57 may also be interpreted as a ratio of the total radiative energy within a unit frequency to the total stellar rest - mass energy , @xmath58 either way , @xmath57 is a convenient quantity that tells us how much of the stellar rest - mass energy is converted into the radiative energy within a unit frequency interval .    in fk06",
    "we have shown that @xmath57 can be calculated robustly for a given stellar population , i.e. , @xmath56 , using the basic stellar physics and radiative processes in the interstellar medium .",
    "for the radiative processes and stellar populations we consider in this paper , @xmath59 ( see figure  2 of fk06 ) . from this one",
    "may obtain a quantity that is commonly used in the literature , the luminosity _ per stellar mass _",

    "this approach was used by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall use @xmath66  myr as our fiducial value , to be consistent with the value used by the simulation of @xcite .",
    "we also study the effects of changing @xmath6 in   [ sec : tsf ] .",
    "] therefore , we finally obtain @xmath67 when the main sequence lifetime of stars is shorter than the star formation timescale , @xmath68 . in terms of @xmath69 we may also write eq .",
    "( [ eq : lnu1 ] ) as @xmath70 .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the star formation timescale is shorter than the main sequence lifetime of stars , @xmath71 , we find a different expression for @xmath72 ( see eq .",

    "( [ eq : lnu1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lnu2 ] ) we find that the former is roughly @xmath75 times the latter .",
    "in other words , if one misused the latter form when @xmath76 , one would over - estimate the signal by a factor of @xmath77 , which can be as large as a factor of 10 for short - lived , massive stars with @xmath78 . ) for @xmath76 , and thus their predicted amplitudes of nirb are likely over - estimated by a factor of @xmath79 . ]    for the precise calculation one should use both expressions depending on the situation ; however , to simplify the analysis , we shall use either eq .",
    "( [ eq : lnu1 ] ) or ( [ eq : lnu2 ] ) , depending on the ratio of the stellar lifetime averaged over the initial mass spectrum and weighted by the luminosity ( since more massive , shorter lived stars will contribute more to the overall luminosity ) , @xmath80 , to the star formation timescale ( where @xmath81 is the bolometric luminosity ) . in the simulations of @xcite ,",
    "the star formation timescale takes on a universal value , @xmath82  myr .",
    "for all the stellar populations , the luminosity - weighted lifetime is shorter than @xmath83  myr ; thus , eq .  [ eq : lnu2 ] will be our fiducial formula .",

    "this emission is cutoff above 13.6 ev , so all of the ionizing photons go into producing emission in the nebula or the igm .",
    "the expressions given in   2.3 , 2.4 , and 2.5 of fk06 are used for the nebular processes .",
    "we then integrate @xmath72 over a band of observed frequencies @xmath86 to @xmath87 to obtain the band - averaged luminosity per stellar mass , @xmath88 , as @xmath89    following @xcite , we assume all halos have a constant mass - to - light ratio . with the luminosities per stellar mass ,",

    "also , @xmath98 goes down as @xmath3 approaches unity , for which all the ionizing photons would escape halos , and thus no nebular emission would be left in halos .",
    "the stellar properties , such as metallicities and initial mass spectra , affect only @xmath88 .",
    "the simulations from @xcite define a quantity , @xmath99 , which is proportional to the number of ionizing photons that escape into the igm : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the number of ionizing photons emitted per stellar atom .",
    "when modeling stellar populations in our calculations , we shall assure that each of our models agrees with @xmath102 , which was used in the simulations .",
    "@xcite have shown that this choice of @xmath99 , combined with the universal star formation timescale of @xmath103 , can reionize the universe successfully with the resulting electron - scattering optical depth consistent with the wmap data . within this framework ,",
    "since @xmath20 is the only free parameter , models with the same @xmath20 would produce the same reionization histories .",

    "any detection or non - detection of fluctuations in nirb can give us information on stars forming at high redshifts , stars that could have helped to reionize the universe .",
    "the escape fraction of ionizing photons , the star formation efficiency , and the mass and metallicity of the stars can affect the amplitude and shape of the angular power spectrum of fluctuations in nirb .",
    "we modeled the angular power spectrum from halos and the surrounding igm by combining the analytic formulas for the luminosity of halos and the igm with @xmath0-body simulations coupled with radiative transfer for several different populations of stars .",
    "shot noise is a major contributor to the angular power spectrum of halos at small scales , so it is important to include larger scales in observations to minimize the component of shot noise .",
    "the star formation efficiency has a significant effect on the amplitude of the angular power spectrum , with the amplitude of the angular power spectrum being proportional to @xmath97 . for a fixed @xmath115 ( i.e. , for a given reionization history ) , a combination of parameters that maximize the star formation efficiency , @xmath2 , give the largest nirb power spectrum ; thus , the stars that are less massive and have more metals ( smaller @xmath101 ) , and are in halos with a lower escape fraction ( smaller @xmath3 ) will all increase the amplitude of the nirb angular power spectrum .",
    "in general , the amplitude of the angular power spectrum of the halos ( and the mean nirbe ) is mostly dominated by @xmath2 , while the angular power spectrum of the igm can probe the ionization history though the factor @xmath116 .",
    "if we do not fix the reionization history , there are other parameters that can change the amplitude of the angular power spectrum significantly .",
    "the angular power spectrum is inversely proportional to the star formation time scale squared , @xmath117 .",
    "this uncertainty in the star formation time scale can be directly related to our uncertainty in the mass to light ratio of galaxies , for @xmath118 . as changes in @xmath6 result in different reionization histories ( for a given @xmath99 ) , the other tracers of reionization , e.g. , the electron - scattering optical depth measured by the wmap satellite and the abundance of lyman-@xmath38 emitting galaxies , should help narrow down a range of magnitudes of the nirb fluctuations that are consistent with what we already know about the cosmic reionization .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the igm is typically a minor contributor to the overall fluctuations ; however , the igm contribution can be comparable to the halo contribution ( the stellar contribution as well as the nebular contribution from within the halo ) , especially if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from halos is high . in the limit that @xmath3 is close to unity ,",
    "we expect @xmath119 , as @xmath120 would be completely dominated by the stellar emission .",
    "one can even make the igm contribution dominate over the halo contribution by increasing @xmath6 , which suppresses the halo contribution as @xmath121 , and leads to a delay in the reionization .",
    "yet , this would not change the igm power spectrum significantly , as the igm luminosity power spectrum saturates when the ionization fraction reaches @xmath122 .",
    "of course , we need to make sure that such a model can still complete the reionization by @xmath123 , and can reproduce the electron - scattering optical depth measured by wmap .",
    "the redshift at which the formation of stars contributing to nirb ends , @xmath124 , can also change the amplitude of the angular power spectrum significantly .",
    "changing @xmath125 affects not only the amplitude of the angular power spectrum , but also the shape .",
    "the attenuation of lyman-@xmath38 photons for the most part , does not affect the angular power spectrum of the halos greatly , but could affect the amplitude of the igm by about a factor of 2 .",
    "previous estimates of the angular power spectrum of the nirb by @xcite neglected to account for nonlinear bias . for our simulation with the minimum halo mass of @xmath26 ,",
    "the nonlinear bias is large enough to change the prediction for the shape of the angular power spectrum qualitatively : a turnover of @xmath126 at @xmath127 that was predicted by @xcite is not seen in our calculation , and the shape of the clustering component ( i.e. , minus the shot noise ) , is consistent with a pure power law , @xmath128 .",
    "note that our results for the shape of the angular power spectrum are valid for the minimum halo mass of @xmath129 .",
    "the non - linear bias would be smaller for smaller mass halos .",
    "for example , the simulation carried out by @xcite resolves halos down to a smaller mass , @xmath130 , and would therefore find a smaller average bias .",
    "the halo bias is mass dependent , more massive halos being more strongly biased .",
    "the effective linear bias , @xmath131 , is the integral of the linear halo bias for a given mass , @xmath132 , times the mass function weighted by mass above a certain minimum mass , i.e. , @xmath133/[\\int_{m_{\\rm min}}^\\infty dm_h~m_h ( dn_h / dm_h)]$ ] . as there are many more halos at lower masses , lowering @xmath134 would result in a lower average bias . as the degree of the non - linear bias increases as the linear bias increases , one would find a smaller non - linear bias for a lower @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we might still see a turnover if these smaller halos are bright enough to contribute to the nirb .    however , the real situation would be more complex than the above picture . in @xcite",
    ", we also performed reionization simulations which resolve source halos down to this lower minimum mass of @xmath135 .",
    "there , however , unlike @xcite , we took account of the fact that those small - mass ( @xmath136 ) halos are subject to jeans filtering , and thus their star formation is suppressed if they reside within the ionized regions .",
    "the suppression occurs disproportionately on the low - mass halos clustered around the high - density peaks ( which are the first to be ionized ) .",
    "therefore , the ultimate effect may not be as large as one might think by just including all halos down to @xmath137 . while it is plausible that there may be a turn - over , it is also quite plausible that the location of the turn - over would be on a smaller scale than what would be predicted by the linear bias model .",
    "this can , in principle , be studied using higher - resolution simulations like those in @xcite that include the jeans filtering effect , but the simulation box size of @xmath138 there is not quite large enough to give a reliable statistical measure of the large - scale structure and angular fluctuations in which we are interested . towards that end",
    ", we have more recently performed a new set of large - box , higher - resolution simulations that include the jeans filtering effect , reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall present results on the nirb from these higher - resolution simulations elsewhere . in any case , the above consideration suggests that the shape of the angular power spectrum gives us important information about the nature of sources contributing to nirb as well as the physics of cosmic reionization .",
    "current observations seem to favor low levels of both the fluctuations and the mean nirb due to the high-@xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) sources .",
    "the current observations of the mean intensity of the nirb seem to rule out high levels of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "most of our models for fluctuations still lie beneath the current observations of the fluctuations of the nirb .",
    "the upcoming ciber missions will improve the sensitivity of observations , but many of our models still lie below their sensitivity limits .",
    "nevertheless , these new observations should be able to put tighter constraints on which high-@xmath74 galaxy populations are allowed and which are ruled out . given the lack of direct observational probes of high-@xmath74 galaxy populations contributing to the cosmic reionization , the nirb continues to offer invaluable information regarding the physics of cosmic reionization that is difficult to probe by other means .",

    "<S> the near infrared background ( nirb ) is one of a few methods that can be used to observe the redshifted light from early stars at a redshift of six and above , and thus it is imperative to understand the significance of any detection or non - detection of the nirb . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations of the nirb can provide information on the first structures , such as halos and their surrounding ionized regions in the inter galactic medium ( igm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we combine , for the first time , @xmath0-body simulations , radiative transfer code , and analytic calculations of luminosity of early structures to predict the angular power spectrum ( @xmath1 ) of fluctuations in the nirb . </S>",
    "<S> we study , in detail , the effects of various assumptions about the stellar mass , the initial mass spectrum of stars , metallicity , the star formation efficiency ( @xmath2 ) , the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath3 ) , and the star formation timescale ( @xmath4 ) , on the amplitude as well as the shape of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum of nirb fluctuations is maximized when @xmath2 is the largest ( as @xmath5 ) and @xmath3 is the smallest ( as more nebular emission is produced within halos ) . a significant uncertainty in the predicted amplitude of @xmath1 exists due to our lack of knowledge of @xmath6 of these early populations of galaxies , which is equivalent to our lack of knowledge of the mass - to - light ratio of these sources . </S>",
    "<S> we do not see a turnover in the nirb angular power spectrum of the halo contribution , which was claimed to exist in the literature , and explain this as the effect of high levels of non - linear bias that was ignored in the previous calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is partly due to our choice of the minimum mass of halos contributing to nirb ( @xmath7 ) , and a smaller minimum mass , which has a smaller non - linear bias , may still exhibit a turn over . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our results suggest that both the amplitude and shape of the nirb power spectrum provide important information regarding the nature of sources contributing to the cosmic reionization . </S>",
    "<S> the angular power spectrum of the igm , in most cases , is much smaller than the halo angular power spectrum , except when @xmath3 is close to unity , @xmath6 is longer , or the minimum redshift at which the star formation is occurring is high . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , low levels of the observed mean background intensity tend to rule out high values of @xmath8 . </S>"
