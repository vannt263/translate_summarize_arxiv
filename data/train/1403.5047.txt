    "the exciton - polariton bose - einstein condensate  @xcite ( bec ) in planar microcavities has become subject to much research and study  @xcite in the past decade with the promise of polariton condensation happening at much higher temperature than atomic condensates .",
    "@xcite becs are low temperature systems of integer spin bosons in which , below a certain critical temperature , a large fraction condense to the ground state and become macroscopically coherent .",
    "@xcite being supercooled quantum systems , they offer a wide variety of topological phases and excitations such as the quantum vortex which will be the main focus in this paper .",
    "the exciton - polariton is a quasiparticle formed by the strong coupling of a microcavity photon mode to electronic excitations in quantum wells embedded in a microcavity .",
    "the most notable features of this composite bosonic particle are its light effective mass ( about 4 to 5 orders smaller than the electron mass ) which arises from the photonic component , and strong binary interactions from the excitonic one .",
    "polaritons also have a short lifetime ( few orders of picoseconds ) , which inhibits thermalization to the lattice temperature . however , polariton - polariton scattering processes allow polaritons to relax fast enough into a macroscopically occupied ground state , effectively creating a polariton condensate .",
    "@xcite    the quantum vortex is one of the most well studied topological defects in atomic becs and has been observed in both polariton parametric oscillators  @xcite and non - resonantly excited polariton becs .",
    "@xcite these defects consist of a vortex core , where the condensate density reaches its minimum and phase becomes singular , and a circulating superfluid flow around , with phase winding being an integer number of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite its topological stability makes the vortex a prime candidate for a robust binary memory component , and recent works have considered control of the path of moving vortices .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we show that stable vortex solutions of charge @xmath3 are supported by an incoherent ring - shaped pump .",
    "such pump shapes were considered experimentally , demonstrating pattern formation ,  @xcite evaporative cooling  @xcite and vortex - antivortex arrays .",
    "@xcite unlike in cases of deterministic vortex generation ,  @xcite the vortices that we predict represent multistability in the system and are challenging to observe experimentally due to the random selection of the vortex sign during condensation , which is averaged to zero in multishot experiments .",
    "nevertheless , one can expect that coherent pulses can deterministically select the vortex sign allowing their detection .",
    "@xcite alternatively , it was recently shown that very high quality microcavities can be used to make single shot measurements , allowing vortex detection in ring - shaped traps .",
    "@xcite vortex states can be read by using interferometry ,  @xcite while other methods have been discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] , such as detection of the wavevector of polaritons around the vortex core .    using simple potential guides shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we find that a vortex charge can be both copied or inverted to a second spatially separate ring pump even under a large amount of stochastic noise .",
    "this satisfies the standards of copying binary memory , with high fidelity , and of a not gate . the choice of whether transferring the same charge @xmath4 or the inverse charge @xmath5 can be controlled by either changing the length scales of the potential guide or the distance between the ring pumps",

    "we can not rule out the possibility of very rare events that may reduce slightly the fidelity in the limit of a very large set of repetitions .",

    "if the distance is too small , then polaritons from each pump interfere strongly and the vortex states are lost .",
    "if the distance is too great , random noise will overcome the polaritons traveling in the guide .",
    "fixing the width of the guide at 15 @xmath24 m , the two relevant length scales are the lateral length of the guide between the two ring pumps , @xmath78 , and the distance between the two ring pump centers , @xmath75 as shown in fig .",
