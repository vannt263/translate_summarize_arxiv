    "gravitational wave astronomy is currently developing as a new way of studying the cosmos , with a number of different experiments starting operating or being developed : earth - based interferometers ( ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , geo600  @xcite and tama  @xcite ) , resonant bars ( explorer , auriga , nautilus , allegro and niobe ; see  @xcite ) and spheres such as minigrail  @xcite , as well as the laser interferometer space antenna lisa  @xcite .",
    "the scientific success of these detectors in producing new physical and astrophysical knowledge depends on the amount of _ a priori _ available theoretical understanding about the different sources of gravitational waves .",
    "it is then of outmost importance to have good theoretical descriptions of the systems that are likely to be observed by the ongoing gravitational - wave experiments .    due to the weak character of the gravitational interactions",
    "there is only a few number of systems that can generate gravitational waves detectable for the experiments just mentioned . in general , the dynamics of these systems involves strong gravitational fields that need to be described , using different levels of approximations , by general relativity .",
    "this is the case in the modeling of compact objects such as neutron stars and supernov  core collapse , where non - linearity plays a role in the dynamics . for these systems ,",
    "relativistic perturbation theory is an excellent approach .",
    "the linear theory has been used for a long time to study their oscillations and instabilities  @xcite . however , we know relatively little about non - linear dynamical effects ( mainly due to numerical studies  @xcite ) . despite the fact that strong non - linear effects require a fully non - perturbative approach",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that there are interesting physical phenomena that only involve a mild non - linearity for which a second - order treatment should be perfectly suited . in this sense ,",
    "a non - linear perturbative approach is therefore timely and may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of generation of gravitational waves .",
    "an interesting scenario to study is a neutron star which is oscillating radially and non - radially . at first order radial oscillations of a spherical star do nt emit _ per se _ any gravitational waves , but they can drive and possibly amplify non - radial oscillations and then produce gravitational radiation to a significant level .",
    "in addition one may expect the appearance of non - linear harmonics , which may also come out at lower frequencies than the linear modes  @xcite , where the earth - based laser interferometers have a higher sensitivity .",
    "an additional motivation is that there are a number of studies aiming at investigating if non - radial oscillations of stars can be excited by external sources ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , our idea is to investigate whether non - radial oscillations can be driven or even amplified through coupling by an internal radial oscillation , regardless of the presence of an external source .",
    "these non - linear processes can occur , for instance , in a proto - neutron star that is still pulsating .",
    "a mainly radial pulsation could for example drive the non - radial oscillations , either naturally present , or excited through fall - back accretion .    in recent papers  @xcite a non - linear multi - parameter",
    "perturbative formalism has been developed , which can be applied to the study of the non - linear dynamics of the oscillations of neutron stars , as shown in  @xcite where it has been further developed to study a particular second - order effect : the coupling of radial and non - radial first order perturbations of a compact spherical star .",
    "one of the main ideas behind this work is that it is very convenient to treat the two sets of perturbations , radial and non - radial , as separately parametrized and then to study , at the next perturbative order , the way in which they couple , which corresponds to a particular sector of the second - order perturbations , the one formed by the product of radial and non - radial perturbations . in  @xcite , the equations describing the coupling were obtained for the case of polar non - radial perturbations and gauge - invariant variables were also found ( having fixed the gauge for the radial ones for simplicity ) .    in this paper , we extend this study to the case of axial perturbations . at first order , axial",
    "perturbations are decoupled from fluid perturbations , but at the next perturbative order , the terms describing the coupling are driven by the radial pulsations .",
    "here we discuss the results of simulations in the time domain that show how the coupling mechanism works and under which conditions we may have a situation in which this coupling produces amplifications due to resonant phenomena .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : in section  [ framework ] we describe the perturbative framework we use in this work . in section  [ ingredients ]",
    "we introduce all the necessary ingredients required by the perturbative scheme in order to study the coupling of radial and axial non - radial oscillations of neutron stars . in section  [ numerics ]",
    "we describe the structure of the computational framework we have implemented to solve the perturbative equations in the time domain . in particular , we discuss in detail the construction of initial data and the numerical treatment of the boundary conditions . in section",
    "[ results ] we present the results of our simulations for two different physical scenarios : ( i ) the scattering of a gravitational wave packet by a differentially rotating star , and ( ii ) the non - linear coupling in a differentially rotating and radially oscillating compact star . in particular we discuss the appearance of amplifications due to resonances of the system .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] , where we summarize the main results of this paper and discuss potential extensions of the approach we have used . in the appendices we give some proofs of the gauge invariance character of some of the perturbative quantities ( appendix  [ gaugeinvariance ] ) , expressions for the source terms in the perturbative equations describing the coupling ( appendix  [ sourceterms ] ) , and the equations for radial perturbations in terms of the _ tortoise _ fluid coordinate ( appendix  [ equationstortoise ] ) .    throughout this work we use the following conventions",

    "in order to investigate the effects of the coupling of linear axial perturbations and first order radial oscillations we use a general two - parameter framework recently developed @xcite .",
    "in essence , this consists of separately parametrizing the radial and non radial oscillations .",
    "we have presented the formalism for the coupling between radial and polar non - radial perturbations in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop and apply the formalism to study the coupling arising from axial perturbations , following the same general lines . in the following we recall the general two - parameter framework .",

    "the presence of the @xmath0-mode in the initial phase of the waveform is related to the choice of initial data that we have done for simplicity ; i.e. , @xmath303 .",
    "this is , in general , non consistent , because these three quantities are not independent ; indeed , a correct set up of the initial data for @xmath164 would require the solution of the `` coupling '' axial constraints ( not reported here ) in a way similar to what is usually done for the first - order polar and axial perturbations ( see for example ref .",

    "the numerical noise is reduced and the waveform looks closer to the expected form .",
    "our perturbative approach does not include backreaction ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) ; in other words , it does not account for the damping of the radial oscillations or the slowing down of the stellar rotation due to contribution of the non - linear coupling to the energy and angular momentum loss in gravitational waves .",
    "backreaction could be studied by looking at higher perturbative orders .",
    "nevertheless , we can provide a rough estimate of the damping time of the radial pulsations by assuming that the energy emitted is completely supplied by the first - order radial oscillations , and that the power radiated in gravitational waves is constant in time .",
    "in this way , the damping time is given by the following expression : @xmath355 where @xmath356 is the energy of a radial eigenmode  ( see table  [ tab : damping_time ] ) , and @xmath357 is the averaged value of the non - linear coupling contribution to the power emitted .",
    "the results for @xmath332 are shown in table  [ tab : damping_time ] . moreover , in the last row of table  [ tab : damping_time ] we give an estimation of the damping of the radial pulsations associated with a certain radial eigenmode in terms of the number of oscillation cycles : @xmath358 where @xmath359 with @xmath360 being the eigenfrequency of the radial eigenmode .",
    "waveforms generated by the coupling between axial differential rotation and the radial fundamental mode .",

    "see text for a discussion.,width=321,height=245 ]    finally , it is important to make some comments on the difference between the two scenarios we have studied : ( i ) scattering of gravitational waves by a radially oscillating star , where we did not find any amplification or resonant effect , and ( ii ) the coupling of differential rotation and radial pulsations , where we have observed amplification when the frequencies associated with these two different first order perturbations are close . this difference is essentially due to the different properties of the source terms in these two cases , which are determined by the first order radial and axial non - radial perturbations . in the first scenario ,",
    "the source acts typically for a relatively short period of time , which is given by the travel time of a gravitational wave across the star .",
    "after the gravitational waves have been scattered , the first order signal still present inside the star decreases according to the power law for gravitational wave tails . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a ringing phase in the second order perturbations but it is well below the amplitude of first order signal . on the other hand , in the second scenario , the source terms act periodically on the star forever , as this model does not contain the back - reaction . as a result ,",
    "the source has more time to couple with the axial non - radial perturbations .",
    "in this paper we have investigated non - linear effects in the dynamics of compact stars due to the coupling of radial and axial non - radial oscillations , and the potential impact that this mechanism may have in the emission of gravitational radiation . to that end , we have used and extended the multi - parameter non - linear perturbative scheme introduced in  @xcite , and further developed in  @xcite for the case in which the coupling is between radial and polar non - radial oscillations .    the non - linear perturbative equations and the gauge - invariant character of the perturbative quantities describing the coupling have been derived by using the 2-parameter perturbation theory in connection with the gsgm formalism  @xcite . as expected , in the stellar interior ,",
    "the perturbative variables describing the coupling satisfy inhomogeneous linear equations .",
    "the form of these equations is such that the associated homogeneous equations are constructed from the same linear operators as the equations for the first order axial non - radial perturbations .",
    "the source terms are quadratic in the first - order radial and axial non - radial perturbative quantities . in the exterior we do not have source terms and hence , the dynamics is described by regge - wheeler - type equations .",
    "interior and exterior communicate through the junction conditions at the surface of the star .",
    "we have discussed in detail the initial data setup used in the simulations presented in this paper as well as the different boundary conditions .",
    "the initial data for the radial oscillations corresponds to specific eigenmodes . in the case of the axial non - radial perturbations",
    "we have used two types of initial data : ( i ) static profiles representing differential rotation of the star from the relativistic @xmath215-constant rotation law , and ( ii ) gaussian packets containing a number of axial eigenmodes .",
    "regarding the boundary conditions , of particular importance are the conditions at the stellar surface . in order to avoid negative values of the mass energy density near the surface due to the eulerian description of the radial and non - radial polar perturbations , we have adopted an approximation already used in the literature  @xcite , that consists in removing outer layers of the neutron star , which is equivalent , in most of the cases we deal with , to neglect less than one percent of the total gravitational mass of the star .",
    "this approximation leads to a description of the second - order coupling effects which is accurate to better than five per cent .",
    "we have presented a computational framework for investigating , in the time domain , the evolution of the axial non - linear perturbations describing the coupling .",
    "our numerical codes are based on finite difference methods and standard explicit evolution algorithms .",
    "their structure is hierarchical : first , we solve the tov equations ; then , we evolve a time step the first - order radial and non - radial perturbations , and with the result we update the source terms for the non - linear perturbations ; eventually , we evolve them in the same time step .    we have then studied two different physical scenarios : ( i ) the scattering of a gravitational wave by a radially pulsating star .",
    "( ii ) a differentially rotating and radially oscillating star .",
    "the simulations for the first scenario have shown that the correction onto the gravitational wave signal due to the non - linear coupling are of the order of @xmath289 or less when the radial oscillations are in the fundamental mode , and of the order of @xmath290 or less when we consider higher radial overtones . moreover , the properties of the waveforms and spectra are essentially unchanged with respect to the first - order ones .",
    "the simulations for the second scenario have provided more interesting results .",
    "the waveforms we obtain have the following pattern : at the early stages of the evolution they present an initial @xmath0-mode burst related to the initial data choice . at later stages ,",
    "the signal becomes periodic and is driven by the radial pulsations through the sources .",
    "this is confirmed by an analysis of the spectra , which show that the gravitational wave signal contains the frequencies of the radial eigenmodes prescribed in the initial data .",
    "more interestingly , we have found a resonance effect that takes place as the frequencies of the radial eigenmodes considered get close to the frequency of the first @xmath0-mode .",
    "for the stellar model used in this paper , the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal associated with the fourth radial overtone ( the one with the closest frequency to the first @xmath0-mode ) is about three orders of magnitude higher than that associated with the radial fundamental mode .",
    "we have also given a rough estimate of the damping times of the radial pulsations due to the gravitational wave emission .",
    "the values found depend strongly on the presence of resonances . in the case of differential rotation with a @xmath296 ms rotation period at the axis and a differential rotation parameter @xmath253 km ,",
    "the fundamental radial mode gets damped after about ten billion oscillation periods , while the fourth overtone after only ten .",
    "this is not surprising , and shows that the coupling near resonances is a very effective mechanism for extracting energy from the radial oscillations . in this sense , it is important to mention that the detection of such a gravitational wave signature would provide important information about the stellar physical properties , specially because it has information on radial pulsations , which can be determined easily for a large class of equations of state .",
    "the work presented in this paper represents a first step in the study of the non - linear coupling of oscillations of compact relativistic stars and its impact for gravitational wave physics .",
    "the next step in this study is the description of the coupling between radial and polar non - radial oscillations .",
    "the spectrum of the polar non - radial perturbations is richer than the axial case due to the presence of the fluid modes , which may have frequencies lower than the spacetime modes and a longer gravitational damping . as a result",
    ", we may expect a more effective coupling with the radial pulsation modes and more channels for possible resonant amplifications .",
    "other extensions of this work include the consideration of more realistic models of the stellar structure , by taking into account the effects of rotation , composition gradients , magnetic fields , dissipative effects , etc .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to investigate a proto - neutron star model to compare the damping rates due to gravitational radiation produced by the coupling of oscillations with the strong damping induced by the presence of a high - entropy envelope surrounding the newly created neutron star . by including rotation we may find new interesting non - linear effects due to the different behaviour of radial and non - radial modes in a rotating configuration .",
    "while the radial modes are only weakly affected so that their spectrum is essentially the same as in a non - rotating configuration ( when scaled by the central density ) , the non - axisymmetric modes manifest a splitting similar to the zeeman effect in atomic spectra .",
    "the rotation removes the mode degeneracy in the azimuthal harmonic number of the non - rotating case .",
    "the details of this frequency separation depend on the stellar compactness and rotation rate .",
    "it may then happen that for a given stellar rotation rate and compactness the non - radial frequencies cross the sequence of radial frequencies  @xcite so that the frequencies of these two kinds of modes are comparable , and possible resonances or instabilities could influence the spectrum and the gravitational wave signal . finally , as we have already mentioned above",
    ", it would be also interesting to explore the impact of gravitational back - reaction on the dynamical coupling mechanism ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
