    "kondo physics@xcite has seen a revival in recent years due to an exciting series of new experiments on mesoscopic@xcite and nanoscale@xcite systems that has enabled a more thorough and controlled study of the basic problem of a local moment interacting with a sea of conduction electrons .",
    "it is now possible , for example in quantum dots , to tune the kondo temperature , @xmath0 , with externally applied gate voltages@xcite or , with the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) , to study the kondo effect at single magnetic impurities on metallic surfaces.@xcite the superb spatial resolution of the stm permits unprecedented direct local spectroscopic detail of kondo impurities .",
    "recent low temperature(@xmath1 k ) stm experiments@xcite have probed the spectroscopy of isolated nanometer and sub - nanometer ferromagnetic ( co ) clusters on metallic single walled carbon nanotubes.@xcite the tunneling spectrum of these small ferromagnetic clusters exhibited several interesting features ",
    "most notably kondo effect in sub - nanometer diameter clusters and well resolved discrete level spacing in nanometer size clusters .",
    "both sub - nanometer and nanometer size clusters exhibited a coulomb charging gap in the spectrum near zero bias .",
    "the kondo effect in the sub - nanometer size clusters appeared in the spectrum as a fano - like sharp _ peak _ @xcitewith a half - width @xmath2 mev ( @xmath3 80 k ) at 4 k. this peak was not present at 100 k , presumably due to thermal destruction of the kondo resonance .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a theoretical framework to study the spin - flip scattering of conduction electrons from finite size ferromagnetic clusters adsorbed on metallic surfaces . in particular , we are interested in understanding some of the _ size - dependent features _ observed in the tunneling spectrum .",
    "we focus on how the kondo effect , the level spacing and the level widths depend on the size of the cluster .",
    "cluster ferromagnetism may be described by two alternate models : ( i ) in the experiments of odom _",
    "et al._@xcite magnetism of the cluster is most likely _ itinerant _ in nature as bulk co is an itinerant band ferromagnet .",
    "the basic physics of itinerant clusters is captured in the model of refs .",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : itin ] ) .",
    "( ii ) in some other cases , however , including the case of many semiconducting ferromagnets @xcite and rare earth materials , ferromagnetism is better described in terms of _ local moments _ that couple ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically to the cluster conduction electrons ( holes ) . this motivated us to introduce another exactly solvable model , where d - electrons produce highly localized magnetic moments .",
    "while the excitation spectrum of the two models turns out to be very similar , the way they couple to the metallic substrate is rather different .",
    "the most appropriate model to use in a given physical situation depends on the material that composes the nanoparticle and whether it is more appropriate to think of the magnetism of the particle as due to localized moments or itinerant electrons that , although free to move about , are nevertheless polarized strongly enough to give a net spin to the cluster .",
    "we make several assumptions during our computations : we assume the clusters to have between , say , eight and forty atoms and that they are large enough that bulk properties , such as the magnetization per atom , are not changed substantially due to their finite size .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the single particle states on the island are of extended character , and therefore the single particle level spacing decreases as @xmath4 with an increasing number of cluster atoms , @xmath5 .",
    "we also assume that the ferromagnetic spin splitting @xmath6 of the extended states on the island is much larger than the single particle level spacing and is approximately independent of the size of the cluster .",
    "thus the total spin of the cluster is rather large and is roughly proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the strength of the electron tunneling between the metal and the cluster we may distinguish two regimes : weak and strong . for weak",
    "tunneling we derive an effective kondo hamiltonian in second order perturbation theory in the tunneling . in this regime",
    "we find that at very low energy scales the cluster behaves most similarly to a quantum dot with a single unpaired electron .",
    "however , ferromagnetic interactions induce a large spin on the cluster and at the same time _ reduce _ the value of the effective exchange coupling between the spin of the cluster and the electrons in the metal .",
    "the sign of the exchange coupling depends on the specific details of the band structure on the nanoparticle . for a co cluster ,",
    "in particular , the itinerant model gives a tendency for _ antiferromagnetic _ coupling , and possibly produces a kondo effect .",
    "however , the kondo temperature @xmath0 , decreases very fast with increasing cluster sizes , and therefore the kondo effect can be observed only for very small clusters .",
    "the effective couplings we obtain , @xmath8 , turn out to be in general @xmath9 matrices describing spin - flip scattering among the @xmath10 conduction band orbital modes that couple to the cluster ( @xmath10=4 for metallic nanotubes@xcite ) .",
    "therefore we expect that a series of kondo effects takes place at kondo temperatures corresponding to the antiferromagnetic eigenvalues of @xmath8 .",
    "the total spin of the impurity , @xmath11 gets successively screened at each kondo temperature as the temperature is lowered : @xmath12 . for a nanotube this compensation",
    "can never be complete@xcite for any spin greater than 2 since there are only four channels available for screening.@xcite the degeneracy of the remaining unscreened spin will ultimately be lifted by magnetic anisotropy induced by spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    to make closer contact with the experiments of odom _",
    "et al._@xcite we compute the stm tunneling spectrum using the itinerant model .",
    "the simultaneous observation of the coulomb gap and the discrete levels , whose widths almost equal the level spacing , suggest that the clusters investigated are in the intermediate tunneling regime .",
    "nevertheless , carrying out perturbative calculations in the weak tunneling limit , we are able to reproduce the essential features of the stm spectrum _ above _ the the coulomb charging energy .",
    "we find that small fluctuations in the charging energies can give rise to very asymmetrical stm spectra .     from the stm spectra of the clusters at higher voltages , we can crudely estimate the kondo temperature , @xmath0 , of a small co cluster of the size that exhibited a kondo effect in ref .",
    "however , our estimates tend to give a @xmath0 that is too small .",
    "we find that typical mesoscopic fluctuations in the charging energies of a ferromagnetic cluster can considerably increase the kondo temperature , however , they do not account for the difference between our theoretical estimates and the experimentally observed @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the fact that some small co clusters exhibit kondo effect while others do not , indicates that these mesoscopic fluctuations may indeed play an important role in determining @xmath0 : since @xmath0 depends exponentially on @xmath8 , relatively small changes in the latter can induce large variations of @xmath0 .",

    "we take @xmath31 , corresponding to an infinitely strong level repulsion .",
    "the advantage of this model is that @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are conserved quantities and therefore the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ model_i ] ) can be diagonalized exactly . in the more general situation",
    "a magnetic anisotropy term should be added to the hamiltonian .",

    "the remaining states within the ground state multiplet may be explicitly constructed using the lowering operator : @xmath38    in itinerant ferromagnets there is an approximate rigid band splitting between spin up and spin down electron density of states.@xcite throughout this paper , we will assume that our clusters are large enough that the band splitting energy , @xmath6 , is well approximated by the bulk value of the specific material we are considering . in our model @xmath6 can be defined as the energy difference between the highest occupied spin up level , @xmath39 , and the highest occupied spin down level , @xmath40 : @xmath41 and from band structure calculations it is known to be typically of the order of a few electron volts@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ states ] ) .",

    "using eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , one can estimate the energy cost of a particle - hole excitation ( see fig .",

    "their effect can be fully taken into account by renormalizing the ` chemical potential ' @xmath63 and the mesoscopic parameter @xmath44 , and they therefore do not modify our results .    using a stability analysis similar to the previous one it is a trivial matter to show that typically @xmath64    for later purposes it is also useful to have excitation energies of particles and holes added to _ any _ level defined , @xmath65 .",
    "for example , increasing the total spin by adding an electron to the @xmath17 unoccupied level rather than the one immediately above @xmath39 gives , @xmath66 removing an electron from level @xmath67 below @xmath40 so that the total spin increases gives @xmath68    it is important to point out that in our model all effects of mesoscopic fluctuations have been put into the quantities @xmath22 , @xmath44 and @xmath24 .",
    "all other quantities of the itinerant model are specified by the bulk band structure and the number of atoms , @xmath5 , in a given nanocluster .",
    "a finite size ferromagnetic cluster can scatter electrons between different orbital channels in the substrate and flip their spin while doing so .",
    "if the spin - orbit coupling is sufficiently weak then @xmath69 symmetry in the spin sector implies that the low - energy effective interaction between the cluster spin and the electrons takes the form ( apart from a potential scattering term ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a hermitian matrix of spin - flip exchange couplings among the various orbital channels , indexed by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) is evaluated by summing over both states with an extra particle and states with an extra hole in the intermediate state ( see fig .  [ kondo ] ) .",
    "after a rather straightforward computation we find that @xmath71 is given by the sum of three contributions : @xmath104 the couplings @xmath105 and @xmath106 describe the contributions from tunneling processes involving doubly occupied and empty single particle levels : @xmath107 and the incoming and outgoing electrons were put at the fermi energy . since @xmath108",
    "both contributions are _ ferromagnetic _ , _ i.e. _ , all eigenvalues of @xmath109 are negative . to see this",
    "let us first neglect the @xmath77-dependence of the @xmath110 s .",
    "then the matrices @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) can be expressed as a sum : @xmath113 .",
    "each of these terms is obviously negative semidefinite , _",

    "i.e. _ , in a diagonal basis all their eigenvalues are negative or zero .",
    "this simple proof can readily be extended for k - dependent @xmath110 s .",
    "the physical reason that the doubly occupied and empty single particle states give rise to a ferromagnetic contribution to @xmath118 is that in the intermediate state in second order perturbation theory an electron ( hole ) that hops onto the island with spin parallel to that of the cluster has smaller energy than than an electron ( hole ) with opposite spin orientation , due to the ferromagnetic exchange _ on _ the cluster .",
    "therefore an electron ( hole ) on the substrate with spin parallel to that of the cluster can lower its kinetic energy more efficiently through hopping to the empty ( doubly occupied ) states .",
    "this is reflected by the smaller energy denominator in eqs .",
    "( [ j_d ] ) and ( [ j_e ] ) .",
    "singly occupied levels , on the other hand , give an _ antiferromagnetic _ contribution to @xmath118 : @xmath119 with @xmath120 having only non - negative eigenvalues.@xcite this is a result of the pauli principle , because only electrons ( holes ) in states with spin antiparallel to that of the cluster may hop onto singly occupied levels in second order perturbation theory , and thereby reduce their kinetic energy .",
    "( [ j_d ] ) , ( [ j_e ] ) , and ( [ j_s ] ) constitute one of the central results of the paper .",
    "they describe how @xmath118 depends on the density of states of the singly occupied levels on the cluster , the excitation energies to the @xmath121 manifold of states and the tunneling amplitudes to the various levels of the cluster .    in general",
    ", there is a competition among the three terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : j_sum ] ) , and thus the sign of eigenvalues of @xmath71 depends on the specific structure of the single particle density of states on the cluster , and other mesoscopic parameters such as @xmath122 . in the _ absence _ of ferromagnetic interactions on the cluster , @xmath123 ,",
    "however , the ferromagnetic contributions @xmath106 and @xmath105 identically vanish , and the effective interaction is always antiferromagnetic , provided there is an odd number of electrons on the cluster .     the itinerant model has been used independently in ref .   to describe spin @xmath124 metallic nanoclusters with similar results .",
    "in that case the ferromagnetic interaction is weak , @xmath125 , the island is far from a ferromagnetic unstability , and the @xmath124 ground state of the island results rather from two single particle states of the island having energies accidentally closer than @xmath126 .",
    "then the ferromagnetic contribution of the doubly occupied and unoccupied levels is usually negligible , and the effective exchange interaction is dominated by the antiferromagnetic contributions of the singly occupied levels.@xcite    the off - diagonal elements of @xmath71 are a sum of random numbers since the @xmath127 of eq .",
    "( [ v_n_sum ] ) have random phase for different @xmath67 and @xmath72 s .",
    "therefore the size of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath118 will be down by a factor of @xmath128 compared to the diagonal ones with @xmath129 , and the matrix @xmath71 will be dominated by the diagonal elements if the number of scattering channels @xmath10 is much less than @xmath130 .",
    "it is instructive and also useful to specialize the results of sec .",
    "[ perturbativelycoupled]a to the important case of a ferromagnetic cluster that makes contact with a metallic substrate in only a single point .",
    "then we can choose a basis where @xmath118 consists of a single non - zero element as all but one conduction channel will decouple from the cluster ( that is , a linear combination of the host orbital modes can be found such that only one orbital mode in the new basis has non - zero amplitude at the impurity location ) . with the origin taken as the single point of contact , @xmath131 of eq .",
    "( [ v_n_sum ] ) reduces to @xmath132 .",

    "( [ j_e ] ) , ( [ j_d ] ) , and ( [ j_s ] ) can be approximately evaluated by assuming that the tunneling matrix amplitudes do not vary too much from level to level , and replacing the sums by integrals . for @xmath135 , _",

    "the ferromagnetic couplings @xmath139 and @xmath140 can be expressed by similar integrals . for @xmath141 these integrals can be combined in a straightforward calculation where the integrand @xmath142 is separated into the two regions @xmath143 and @xmath144 and then approximated in each region .",

    "( [ eq : jestimate ] ) describes the dependence of @xmath8 on the _ particular details of the density of states _ of an itinerant ferromagnetic nanocluster .",
    "the first term involves a principal value integral ( denoted by @xmath147 ) over energy and clearly shows that whenever @xmath148 the contribution to @xmath8 is antiferromagnetic ; otherwise it is ferromagnetic , _",
    "i.e. _ electron and hole excitations in the singly occupied states give rise to an antiferromagnetic coupling while electron ( hole ) excitations of the empty ( doubly occupied ) states give rise to a ferromagnetic contribution .",
    "the last two terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jestimate ] ) are _ mesoscopic fluctuations _ that depend on the specific charging energies of the nanocluster and the density of states at the top of the minority and majority bands .",
    "other mesoscopic fluctuations come from variations in the tunneling matrix elements and in the level spacing , which are ignored in our model .",
    "these mesoscopic corrections become more pronounced for smaller cluster sizes and lead to strong fluctuations around @xmath8 .    for co",
    ", the single particle density of states has a maximum within the spin - polarized part of the spectrum , @xmath148 , resulting in a @xmath8 that tends to be _",
    "antiferromagnetic_. numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jestimate ] ) using the actual density of states for cobalt  @xcite shows that the ferromagnetic contributions to @xmath8 from @xmath139 and @xmath140 reduce the dominant antiferromagnetic contribution from @xmath135 by roughly 50 - 60 percent .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath122 in small clusters by a factor of 2 can lead to sample to sample fluctuations of @xmath14910% in @xmath8 for co. this ultimately leads to large fluctuations in the kondo temperature , @xmath0 , from cluster to cluster , since @xmath8 appears in the exponent of the expression for @xmath0 .",
    "( [ eq : jestimate ] ) also describes how @xmath8 scales with cluster size . from the normalization of the cluster wave functions we find @xmath150 . assuming that the magnetization of the cluster per atom is determined by microscopic mechanisms and thus @xmath151 does not depend on the cluster size , both @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "this results in a fast decrease of @xmath8 with increasing cluster size ( spin ) , @xmath154 , and therefore an exponentially suppressed @xmath0 .",
    "note that this suppression in @xmath0 _ depends only on the level structure _ of the ferromagnetic nanocluster , not on any interference effects which may come from several points of contact.@xcite     it is useful at this point to mention what would happen if @xmath155 and we had an odd number of electrons on the cluster .",
    "there is then only one singly occupied level on the cluster , the sums in eqs .",
    "( [ j_d ] ) and ( [ j_e ] ) vanish , and the sum in eq .",
    "( [ j_s ] ) reduces to just two terms . as a result , for the spin 1/2 cluster , @xmath156 with @xmath157 since @xmath158",
    "thus , for sufficiently large @xmath5 , @xmath8 for the ferromagnetic cluster ( @xmath159 ) will scale to zero faster with @xmath5 than for the non - magnetic cluster . in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimate_kondo_temp ] and in the conclusions , we will comment on what this means for the scaling of the kondo temperature with the number of atoms in such a cluster .",

    "in this paper we have studied electron scattering from ferromagnetic clusters on a metallic substrate .",
    "we studied two cluster models .",
    "the first model describes itinerant ferromagnetism @xcite and is probably appropriate for the description of experiments such as those of odom _",
    "et al._@xcite on co clusters .",
    "we also proposed another solvable cluster model , where spins on the d - levels are treated as _ localized _ entities .",
    "this latter model may be more appropriate for nanoscale rare earth ferromagnets or semiconducting ferromagnets such as gamnas , though in both cases spin - orbit interaction plays an important role and leads to strong spin - anisotropy effects .",
    "we derived a general expression for the kondo couplings @xmath118 for both ferromagnetic cluster models .",
    "the sign of the obtained coupling depends in both models on the details of the band structure . for the itinerant model , virtual tunneling onto the singly occupied levels on the cluster induces an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , while doubly occupied and unoccupied levels generate a ferromagnetic contribution to the exchange coupling .",
    "we have shown that for co clusters the itinerant model leads to _ dominantly antiferromagnetic coupling _ between the cluster spin and the conduction electron spins .",
    "however , fluctuations to doubly occupied and empty states give a large ferromagnetic contribution to the exchange coupling that reduce it to roughly half its original value , and thus can not be neglected .",
    "( as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ perturbativelycoupled ] , for the non - ferromagnetic spin @xmath124 islands studied in ref .",
    "these ferromagnetic contributions are small . )",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath71 involves various scattering channels .",
    "therefore , in principle , the cluster could produce a series of kondo effects where the spin of the cluster is gradually screened.@xcite    it is important to emphasize that in the regime of weak electron tunneling between the metallic substrate and the cluster , ferromagnetism has no special role in producing the kondo effect as we have emphasized in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimate_kondo_temp ] .",
    "in fact , our calculation shows that ferromagnetism tends to _ suppress _ the kondo temperature with increasing @xmath5 more so than for the case of a non - ferromagnetic cluster .",
    "besides the `` strength '' of the ferromagnetism , @xmath42 , the kondo scale is also affected by the density of states on the cluster and finite charging energy , as well as the cluster - metal conductance .",
    "the weak tunneling analysis we performed is only appropriate if the conductance between the cluster and the metal lead is smaller than the quantum conductance .",
    "increasing the number of tunneling points leads to an increase in the cluster - metal conductance .",
    "once this conductance becomes larger than the quantum conductance , the effective charging energy is renormalized to a value close to zero , and a perturbative computation in @xmath181 breaks down . in this regime",
    "extended states on the cluster are strongly hybridized with those in the metal , and can be viewed as part of the extended states in the metal .    in the regime of strong electron tunneling between the substrate and cluster ,",
    "it is not clear whether the itinerant model is able to produce a kondo effect . on the other hand",
    ", our local moment cluster model gives a natural description of the strong tunneling regime . in the local moment model",
    "the localized d - electron spins can be viewed as a magnetic cluster embedded in the metallic host .",
    "this model has been analyzed in detail in ref .  .",
    "in our local moment model , antiferromagnetic exchange ( @xmath269 in eq .",
    "( [ model_ii_final ] ) ) between the local moments and the conduction electrons produces a kondo effect in the strong tunneling regime , though , the kondo temperature decreases very fast with increasing cluster size .",
    "we have also argued that within the local moment model , the effective coupling between the electrons in the substrate and the cluster spin must change sign as one gradually increases the tunneling between the cluster and the substrate .",
    "both the itinerant and local moment calculations show that the kondo coupling is _ inversely _ proportional to the _ total spin _",
    "@xmath11 of a ferromagnetic cluster , which in turn , is proportional to the size of the cluster.@xcite the kondo effect is due to quantum fluctuations of the cluster spin , and these are suppressed as @xmath318 for large ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "thus @xmath0 goes to zero _ exponentially _ with increasing cluster size .    to make stronger contact with the experiments of ref .",
    "on co clusters on a carbon nanotube , we also calculated the stm spectra of a ferromagnetic cluster as described in sec .",
    "[ connection]a .",
    "we found that mesoscopic fluctuations in the charging energies may give rise to interesting qualitative changes and asymmetries in the stm spectrum .",
    "it is possible , for example , that the positively and negatively charged states of the cluster have very different decay rates and therefore the positive ( negative ) voltage side of the spectrum shows discrete levels while the negative ( positive ) voltage side displays a continuum spectrum .",
    "we can use the model parameters extracted from the high energy part of the stm spectra to make an estimate of @xmath0 and predict how it scales with cluster size .",
    "our results agree with the experiments in that they produce a rapid decrease of @xmath0 thereby rendering the kondo effect impossible to observe in larger clusters .",
    "however , the kondo temperature we find is already too small by a factor of @xmath319 compared to the @xmath0 observed for a small cluster of @xmath320 atoms . in sec .  [ discussion ] we have enumerated a number of effects which might raise @xmath0 relative to the predictions of our simple model which may be a possible explanation for the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "we remark that by neglecting the ferromagnetic contributions to the exchange coupling one would obtain a @xmath0 that is larger by a factor of @xmath321 .",
    "thus the ferromagnetic contributions to the effective coupling are essential and can not be neglected .",
    "many open questions remain regarding the physics of small ferromagnetic clusters . among them",
