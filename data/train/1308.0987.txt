    "parent compounds for cuprate superconductors are antiferromagnetic ( af ) charge transfer insulators ( cti ) with localized spins  @xcite . magnetic excitations in the parent compounds",
    "are usual heisenberg model spin waves with maximum energy @xmath4mev  @xcite .",
    "conductivity and superconductivity arises when cuprates are doped with mobile charge carriers . in this paper",
    "we discuss only the hole doping .",
    "it is generally believed that magnetic excitations play a crucial role in the superconducting pairing mechanism .",
    "magnetic structure of cuprates and magnetic excitations dramatically evolve with doping .",
    "magnetic structure has been studied in elastic , quasielastic , and inelastic neutron scattering , as well as in @xmath5sr  @xcite .",
    "the three dimensional ( 3d ) long range af order is preserved at a very low doping up to some doping level @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is about few per cent and the value depends on a particular compound and a particular way of doping .",
    "an incommensurate spin structure starts to develop at @xmath7 .",
    "the incommensurability destroys the 3d coupling between cuo@xmath8 planes and hence the magnetic structure becomes quasistatic in the incommensurate phase .",
    "the quasistatic magnetic order exists up to doping @xmath9 which is a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the qcp is a generic property and position of the qcp is approximately the same for all cuprates , @xmath10 . at @xmath11",
    "the incommensurate magnetic structure becomes fully dynamic .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic structure is perfectly consistent with predictions of the @xmath12 model  @xcite .",
    "the incommensurate magnetic structure is a spin spiral .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic structure is accompanied by redistribution of the magnetic spectral weight .",
    "the static magnetic response is transferred to the `` resonant '' energy , the position of the narrow neck in the hourglass dispersion  @xcite .",
    "the described evolution studied in neutron scattering is relevant to the static magnetic structure and to the low energy , @xmath13mev , magnetic excitations with wave vector close to @xmath14 .",
    "magnetic excitations with energy higher than 100mev in doped cuprates are difficult to assess with neutrons",
    ".    recent development in resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs )  @xcite has made it possible to probe high energy magnetic excitations in cuprates , complementary to the low energy regime studied by neutrons . to avoid ambiguity in describing data",
    "we do not use terms magnon or paramagnon , instead we use the term `` magnetic excitation '' .",
    "the excitation can contain one , two , or more magnons ( paramagnons ) . according to the rixs data the energy width of the magnetic excitation is rather large , @xmath15mev .",
    "the large width itself is not too surprising .",
    "in contrast , the following two points concluded by rixs are far more surprising : ( i ) at a given momentum @xmath16 the magnetic response is a broad peak positioned at some energy .",
    "the position of the peak is independent of doping . in underdoped ,",
    "optimally doped , and even overdoped cuprates the position is the same as that in undoped cti  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the energy - integrated spectral weight at a given momentum is doping - independent . again ,",
    "in underdoped , optimally doped , and even overdoped cuprates the spectral weight is the same as that in undoped cti  @xcite .",
    "thus , while the low energy , @xmath13mev , magnetic response evolves dramatically with doping , the high energy response , @xmath17mev practically does not evolve with doping ( besides the line broadening ) .",
    "the @xmath0 model was suggested phenomenologically at the very early stage of cuprate physics  @xcite .",
    "it became clear very soon that one needs to slightly extend the model by introducing additional hopping matrix elements @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the additional matrix elements are qualitatively important , for example they destroy the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the asymmetry explains a very significant difference between the hole and the electron doping .",
    "dynamics of cuo@xmath8 planes in cuprates is determined by 3d electrons of copper and 2p electrons of oxygen . in the case of hole doping",
    "very few holes go to 3d states of cu . even in overdoped samples",
    "the concentration of 3d holes differs from that in the parent cti insulator only by a few per cent  @xcite .",
    "doped holes go predominantly to 2p states of oxygen .",
    "this is a qualitative difference of a doped cti from a doped mott insulator . in this situation",
    "the @xmath12 model can be justified only by the zhang - rice singlet picture  @xcite .",
    "the picture seems well justified when the hole momentum is close to @xmath20 , however , away from this point the picture is questionable as noted already in the original paper  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the justification of the @xmath12 model is getting more and more questionable when the doping is increasing , see also ref .  .    in the present paper",
    "we address theoretically two issues ( i ) dependence of high energy magnetic excitations on doping , ( ii ) momentum integrated spin some rule .",
    "concerning the first issue we show that the @xmath12 model predicts a significant softening of the high energy magnetic response with doping .",
    "the softening is inconsistent with rixs data .",
    "with respect to the second issue we argue that the rixs data are inconsistent with the picture of almost normal fermi liquid in heavily overdoped cuprates . here , in essence we reiterate the claim already made in the experimental paper  @xcite . we just use a different language to make the same point .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we calculate softening of high energy magnetic response .",
    "this section is relevant to the underdoped regime because the applied theoretical technique is not valid above optimal doping . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the exact spin sum rule .",
    "the sum rule is valid for any doping , however the most important conclusion comes for the heavily overdoped regime .",
    "so this section is mainly aimed at overdoped cuprates .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "we have already pointed out that the low energy magnetic response of cuprates evolves dramatically with doping . on the theoretical side",
    "the response is well described by the @xmath12 model .",
    "calculation of the low energy response within the model is a highly nontrivial theoretical problem .",
    "the only controlled approach to this problem is the chiral perturbation theory used in refs .  .",
    "the perturbation theory uses the parent cti as zero approximation and then allows to derive various physical properties as expansions in powers of doping @xmath21 .",
    "the theory allows to calculate leading in @xmath21 terms as well as first corrections .",
    "the expansion is in powers of @xmath22 , so the expansion is nonanalytic .",
    "we stress that usually only the first correction can be calculated in a fully controlled way . for example",
    "the wave vector of the spin spiral which arises in the model scales as @xmath21 and the first correction to the wave vector @xmath23 is exactly zero .",
    "the static on - site magnetization behaves as @xmath24 where the coefficient @xmath25 has been reliably calculated and the coefficient @xmath26 has been estimated  @xcite .",
    "the position of the narrow neck in the hourglass dispersion scales as @xmath27 .",
    "the presented scalings are valid for a single layer cuprate , for a double layer scalings are somewhat different@xcite",
    ".    high energy properties of the @xmath12 model are much simpler .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory implies that the short range correlations are independent of doping .",
    "this seems consistent with rixs data and this implies that the high energy properties are unchanged at least in the first order of the chiral perturbation theory , i. e. the correction @xmath28 is zero .",
    "`` high energy '' here means that @xmath29 .",
    "we remind that near optimal doping @xmath30mev  @xcite .",
    "high energy properties still can change in the subleading order .",
    "so a variation proportional to @xmath31 is possible . in this section",
    "we calculate this variation .",
    "the results of the present section are valid up to optimal doping , @xmath32 . below we",
    "explain why the present section calculation is not justified at @xmath33 .",
    "the magnetic background fluctuates with typical frequencies @xmath34 .",
    "these quantum fluctuations lead to the dramatic change of the static and the low energy response .",
    "however , the fluctuations are irrelevant for @xmath35 , the high energy excitation `` sees '' a snapshot of the magnetic background and the snapshot is the usual collinear af .",
    "so , here we take the simple af background and calculate the magnetic response using self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) .",
    "the applied techniques are similar to that used long time ago in refs .",
    "however , now we have a better level of understanding .",
    "for instance , we know that the approach can not capture the static and the low energy sector , and we also know about the qualitative importance of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "scba has been widely adopted to study the hole dynamics in the presence of af magnetic order for either single hole@xcite or at finite doping@xcite . in this subsection",
    "we remind the major steps of scba .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath12 model reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electron annihilation operator of spin @xmath38 at site @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the nearest , next - nearest , and next - next - nearest neighbor hopping , respectively . on the top of the hamiltonian ( [ single_layer_h ] )",

    "in particular for optimal doping ( @xmath105 ) the theory predicts softening of the zone boundary magnon by factor of 2 .",
    "there is no any softening observed in experiment .",
    "this indicates that real cuprates are correlated more strongly than the @xmath12 model .",
    "we do not see a possibility to challenge physics of the parent cti .",
    "therefore , in our opinion the discrepancy indicates a failure of the zhang - rice singlet picture away from the heavily underdoped regime .",
    "we would also like to comment on the validity of the single band hubbard model for description of cuprates .",
    "we reiterate again that parent cuprates are not mott insulators , they are charge transfer insulators  @xcite . therefore , one can not directly justify the hubbard model and usual justification is based on the reversed argument that if the @xmath12 model is valid then it must be equivalent to some effective hubbard model .",
    "however , if the @xmath12 model and the zhang - rice singlet picture fails , then , in our opinion , there is no way to justify the single band hubbard model .",

    "the spin structure factor obeys the following sum rule @xmath110 the momentum integration here is carried over full brillouin zone ( bz ) of the lattice . to derive the sum rule one just use the closure relation , @xmath111 , and the anticommutation relation for electron creation / annihilation operators @xmath112 .",

    "the spectral weight for magnetic transitions to the upper hubbard band , @xmath126 , is tiny , @xmath127 .",

    "it completely disappears at doping higher than qcp at @xmath157 .",
    "certainly this contribution does not disappear from the spin sum rule .",
    "the corresponding spectral weight is transferred to the hourglass neck , so the parent heisenberg model static response becomes dynamic with the typical energy @xmath158 ( @xmath159mev ) .",

    "this prediction of the theory is perfectly consistent with rixs data  @xcite , the spin sum rule is naturally fulfilled because almost nothing is changed compared to the parent cti . a small reduction of the total spectral weight proportional to doping @xmath21 , the right hand side in eq .  ( [ srtj ] )",
    ", is beyond accuracy of the chiral perturbation theory .    to avoid misunderstanding",
    "we reiterate that the @xmath12 model makes the following predictions in the underdoped regime , ( i ) softening of the zone boundary magnons with doping discussed in section ii .",
    "( ii ) no variation of spectral weight with doping for high energy magnetic excitations , @xmath162 .",
    "the first prediction is inconsistent with rixs data while the second one is perfectly consistent with the data .",
    "even if the @xmath12 model was valid for overdopped cuprates there is no any controlled theoretical technique to analyze the model in this regime .",
    "as we have already explained the chiral perturbation theory can at most be extended up to optimal doping .",
    "independently of underlying microscopic model there are numerous experimental indications that overdoped cuprates behave like ordinary fermi liquids , see ref . for summary of the indications . in this subsection",
    "we analyse how the exact spin sum rule ( [ sr ] ) is saturated in highly overdoped tl@xmath8ba@xmath8cuo@xmath163 with doping @xmath164 .",
    "we do not have a microscopic theory for this case .",

    "is that while the low energy , @xmath166mev , spin response is almost diminished in tl@xmath8ba@xmath8cuo@xmath163 , the high energy spin response , @xmath167mev is the same as that in the parent compound",
    ". the positions of spectral maximums and the spectral weights are the same  @xcite .",
    "we have a reliable theory for the parent compound and hence we can calculate contribution to the sum rule from @xmath167mev . momentum and @xmath168mev integration of eq .",
    "( [ 1mc ] ) gives 0.37 , and similar integration of eq .",
    "( [ 2mc ] ) gives 0.14 .",
    "hence , the measured spectral weight @xmath169 is close to 0.55 expected from the exact sum rule .",

    "note that the areas over all the curves is the same . ]",
    "the solid black line has been extracted from rixs data  @xcite using the parent compound normalization as it has been described above , so this is the measured spectral density .",
    "the red short - dashed line corresponds to a fully uncorrelated nfl .",
    "the blue long - dashed line is a cartoon for correlated nfl , the effective bandwidth is reduced by 3 times compared to the noninteracting nfl to imitate the effective mass measured in magnetic oscillations  @xcite .",
    "obviously the measured spectral density is dramatically different from what one can expect from a nfl model .",
    "this analysis supports the statement of the experimental paper  @xcite that the observed magnetic response is inconsistent with the nfl picture in highly overdoped tl@xmath8ba@xmath8cuo@xmath163 .",
    "in summary , stimulated by recent rixs data we analyze underdoped and overdoped regimes of cuprates .",
    "( i ) our analysis of the underdoped regime is based on the @xmath96 model .",
    "the model is treated within the controlled chiral perturbation theory with doping being the small expansion parameter .",
    "our calculation demonstrates a significant softening of the high energy ( @xmath167mev ) magnetic response with doping , see eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with rixs data which show that the high energy magnetic response is practically doping independent .",
    "( ii ) our analysis of the heavily overdoped regime is based on the exact spin sum rule .",
    "we demonstrate that the observed in rixs magnetic response saturates the spin sum rule .",
    "this implies that the entire momentum integrated magnetic response is concentrated in the energy interval @xmath172 similar to that in the undoped compound .",
    "such energy concentration of the magnetic response is not consistent with a normal fermi liquid model .    in our opinion",
    "the discussed inconsistencies most likely indicate a failure of the zhang - rice singlet picture away from the underdoped regime . according to rixs measurements antiferromagnetic correlations are stronger than that predicted by the @xmath96 model .",
    "the analysis suggests that electron spins on copper sites are practically not influenced by doping besides of the relatively low frequency , @xmath173mev , fluctuations .",
    "further investigation is certainly needed to address the indicated problems ."
