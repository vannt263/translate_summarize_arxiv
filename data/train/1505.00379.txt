    "the class of @xmath0-concave densities on @xmath6 is defined by the generalized means of order @xmath0 as follows .",

    "this definition apparently goes back to @xcite with further studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; see also @xcite for a nice summary .",
    "it is easy to see that the densities @xmath8 have the form @xmath13 for some concave function @xmath14 if @xmath15 , @xmath16 for some concave @xmath14 if @xmath17 , and @xmath13 for some convex @xmath14 if @xmath18 .",

    "the limiting distribution theory at fixed points when @xmath4 was studied in @xcite , and rate results in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also studied stability properties of the mle projection of any probability measure onto the class of log - concave densities .    compared with the well - studied log - concave densities ( i.e. @xmath17 ) ,",
    "much remains unknown concerning estimation and inference procedures for the larger classes @xmath22 .",
    "one important feature for this larger class is that the densities in @xmath23 are allowed to have heavier and heavier tails as @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , @xmath25distributions with @xmath26 degrees of freedom belong to @xmath27 ( and hence also to @xmath28 for any @xmath29 ) .",
    "the study of maximum likelihood estimators ( mle s in the following ) for general @xmath0-concave densities in @xcite shows that the mle exists and is consistent for @xmath30",
    ". however there is no known result about uniqueness of the mle of @xmath0-concave densities except for @xmath17 .",
    "the difficulties in the theory of estimation via mle lie in the fact we have still very little knowledge of ` good ' characterizations of the mle in the @xmath0-concave setting .",
    "this has hindered further development of both theoretical and statistical properties of the estimation procedure .",
    "some alternative approaches to estimation of @xmath0-concave densities have been proposed in the literature by using divergences other than the log - likelihood functional ( kullback - leibler divergence in some sense ) .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative to maximum likelihood based on generalized rnyi entropies .",
    "similar procedures were also proposed in parametric settings by @xcite using a family of discrepancy measures . in our setting of @xmath0-concave densities with @xmath18 ,",
    "the methods of @xcite can be formulated as follows .",
    "given i.i.d .",
    "observations @xmath31 , consider the primal optimization problem @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes all non - negative closed convex functions supported on the convex set @xmath35 , @xmath36 the empirical measure and @xmath37 . as is shown by @xcite , the associated dual problem @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the polar cone of @xmath34 , and @xmath41 is the conjugate index of @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 . here @xmath44 , the space of signed radon measures on @xmath35 , is the topological dual of @xmath45 , the space of continuous functions on @xmath35 .",
    "we also note that the constraint @xmath46 in the dual form ( [ dualempirical ] ) comes from the ` dual ' of the primal constraint @xmath47 , and the constraint @xmath48 can be derived from the dual computation of @xmath49 : @xmath50 here we used the notation @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the functional defined by @xmath54 for clarity .",
    "now the dual form ( [ dualempirical ] ) follows by the well known fact ( e.g. @xcite corollary 4a ) that the form of the above dual functional is given by @xmath55    for the primal problem @xmath32 and the dual problem @xmath38 , @xcite proved the following results :    @xmath32 admits a unique solution @xmath56 if @xmath57 , where @xmath56 is a polyhedral convex function supported on @xmath58 .",
    "strong duality between @xmath32 and @xmath38 holds .",
    "any dual feasible solution is actually a density on @xmath6 with respect to the canonical lebesgue measure .",
    "the dual optimal solution @xmath59 exists , and satisfies @xmath60    we note that the above results are all obtained in the empirical setting . at the population level , given a probability measure @xmath1 with suitable regularity conditions , consider @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denotes the class of all ( non - negative ) closed convex functions with non - empty interior , which are coercive in the sense that @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite show that fisher consistency holds at the population level : suppose @xmath65 is defined for some @xmath66 where @xmath67 ; then @xmath68 is an optimal solution for @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite also proposed a general discretization scheme corresponding to the primal form ( [ primalempirical ] ) and the dual form ( [ dualempirical ] ) for fast computation , by which the one dimensional problem can be solved via linear programming and the two dimensional problem via semi - definite programming .",
    "these have been implemented in the ` r ` package ` rebayes ` by @xcite .",
    "koenker s package depends in turn on the ` mosek ` implementation of @xcite ; see appendix b of @xcite for further details . on the other hand , in the special case @xmath17 , computation of the mle s of log - concave densities has been implemented in the ` r ` package ` logconcdead ` developed in @xcite in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "however , expensive search for the proper triangulation of the support @xmath35 renders computation difficult in high dimensions .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the estimation procedure proposed by @xcite is the ` natural ' way to estimate @xmath0-concave densities . as a starting point , since the classes @xmath19 are nested in @xmath0 , it is natural to consider estimation of the extreme case @xmath17 ( the class of log - concave densities ) as some kind of ` limit ' of estimation of the larger class @xmath18 .",
    "as we will see , estimation of @xmath0-concave distributions via rnyi divergences is intrinsically related with the estimation of log - concave distributions via maximum likelihood methods .",
    "in fact we show that in the empirical setting in dimension 1 , the rnyi divergence estimators converge to the maximum likelihood estimator for log - concave densities as @xmath5 .",
    "we will show that the rnyi divergence estimators share characterization and stability properties similar to the analogous properties established in the log - concave setting by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "once these properties are available , further theoretical and statistical considerations in estimation of @xmath0-concave densities become possible . in particular , the characterizations developed here enable us to overcome some of the difficulties of maximum likelihood estimators as proposed by @xcite , and to develop limit distribution theory at fixed points assuming that the underlying model is @xmath0-concave .",
    "the pointwise rate and limit distribution results follow a pattern similar to the corresponding results for the mle s in the log - concave setting obtained by @xcite .",
    "this local point of view also underlines the results on global rates of convergence considered in @xcite , showing that the difficulty of estimation for such densities with tails light or heavy , comes almost solely from the shape constraints , namely , the convexity - based constraints .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ theoreticalproperty ] ,",
    "we study the basic theoretical properties of the approximation / projection scheme defined by the procedure ( [ primalpopulation ] ) . in section",
    "[ limitbehaviour ] , we study the limit behavior of @xmath0-concave probability measures in the setting of weak convergence under dimensionality conditions on the supports of the limiting sequence . in section [ limitdistributiontheory ] , we develop limiting distribution theory of the divergence estimator in dimension 1 under curvature conditions with tools developed in sections [ theoreticalproperty ] and [ limitbehaviour ] .",
    "related issues and further problems are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "proofs are given in sections [ sec : proofs ] and [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "in this paper , we denote the canonical lebesgue measure on @xmath6 by @xmath70 or @xmath71 and write @xmath72 for the canonical euclidean @xmath73-norm in @xmath6 , and @xmath74 unless otherwise specified .",

    "we write @xmath88 if @xmath89 converges weakly to @xmath90 for the corresponding probability measures @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    we write @xmath93 unless otherwise specified .",
    "in this section , we study the basic theoretical properties of the proposed projection scheme via rnyi divergence ( [ primalpopulation ] ) . starting from a given probability measure",
    "@xmath1 , we first show the existence and uniqueness of such projections via rnyi divergence under assumptions on the index @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will call such a projection the _ rnyi divergence estimator _ for the given probability measure @xmath1 in the following discussions .",
    "we next show that the projection scheme is continuous in @xmath1 in the following sense : if a sequence of probability measures @xmath94 , for which the projections onto the class of @xmath0-concave densities exist , converge to a limiting probability measure @xmath1 in wasserstein distance , then the corresponding projected densities converge in weighted @xmath3 metrics and uniformly on closed subsets of the continuity set of the limit .",
    "the directional derivatives of such projected densities also converge uniformly in all directions in a local sense .",
    "we then turn our attention the explicit characterizations of the rnyi divergence estimators , especially in dimension 1 .",
    "this helps in two ways .",
    "first , it helps to understand the continuity of the projection scheme in the index @xmath0 , i.e. answers affirmatively the question : for a given probability measure @xmath1 , does the rnyi divergence estimator converge to the log - concave projection as studied in @xcite as @xmath5 ?",

    "<S> we also show continuity of the divergence functional in @xmath1 : if @xmath2 in the wasserstein metric , then the projected densities converge in weighted @xmath3 metrics and uniformly on closed subsets of the continuity set of the limit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , directional derivatives of the projected densities also enjoy local uniform convergence . </S>",
    "<S> this contains both on - the - model and off - the - model situations , and entails strong consistency of the divergence estimator of an @xmath0-concave density under mild conditions . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting and important feature for the rnyi divergence estimator of an @xmath0-concave density is that the estimator is intrinsically related with the estimation of log - concave densities via maximum likelihood methods . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we show that for @xmath4 at least , the rnyi divergence estimators for @xmath0-concave densities converge to the maximum likelihood estimator of a log - concave density as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the rnyi divergence estimator shares similar characterizations as the mle for log - concave distributions , which allows us to develop pointwise asymptotic distribution theory assuming that the underlying density is @xmath0-concave . </S>"
