    "the conjecture that the scaling limits of many two - dimensional systems in statistical physics exhibit conformally invariant behaviour at criticality has led to striking predictions by theoretical physicists concerning , for instance , the values of exponents that describe the behaviour of certian quantities near ( or at ) the critical temperature .",
    "some of these predictions can be reformulated in elementary terms ( see for instance the conjectures for the number of self - avoiding walks of length @xmath0 on a planar lattice ) .    from a mathematical perspective , even if the statement of the conjectures are clear , the understanding of these predictions and of the non - rigorous techniques ( renormalisation group , conformal field theory , quantum gravity , the link with highest - weight representation of some infinite - dimensional lie algebras , see e.g. @xcite ) used by physicists has been limited .",
    "our aim in the present review paper is to present some results derived in joint work with greg lawler and oded schramm @xcite that proves some of these conjectures , and improves substantially our understanding of others .",
    "the systems that we will focus on ( self - avoiding walks , critical percolation , simple random walks ) correspond in the language of conformal field theory to zero central charge .",
    "we structure this paper as follows : in order to put our results into perspective , we start by very briefly describing two models ( self - avoiding paths and critical percolation ) and some of the conjectures that theoretical physicists have produced and that are , at present , open mathematical problems . then , we state theorems derived in joint work with greg lawler and oded schramm @xcite concerning critical exponents for simple random walks and planar brownian motion ( these had been also predicted by theoretical physics ) .",
    "we then show how all these problems are mathematically related , and , in particular , why the geometry of critical percolation in its scaling limit , should be closely related to the geometry of a planar brownian path via a new increasing set - valued process introduced by schramm in @xcite .",
    "we first very briefly describe some predictions of theoretical physics concerning self - avoiding paths in a planar lattice . for a more detailed mathematical account on this subject ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "consider the square lattice @xmath1 and define the set @xmath2 of nearest - neighbour paths of length @xmath0 started at the origin that are self - avoiding .",
    "in other words , @xmath2 is the set of injective functions @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the first problem is to understand the asymptotic behaviour of the number @xmath6 of such self - avoiding paths when @xmath7 .",
    "a first trivial observation is that for all @xmath8 , @xmath9 because the first @xmath0 steps and the last @xmath10 steps of a @xmath11 long self - avoiding path are self - avoiding paths of length @xmath0 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 because if the path goes only upward or to the right , then it is self - avoiding .",
    "this leads immediately to the existence of a constant @xmath13 ( called the connectivity constant of the lattice @xmath1 ) such that @xmath14    note that if one counts the number @xmath15 of self - avoiding paths of length @xmath0 on a triangular lattice , the same argument shows that @xmath16 converges when @xmath7 to some limit @xmath17 .",
    "the connectivity constant is lattice - dependent .",
    "one can also look at other regular planar lattices , such as the honeycombe lattice .",
    "we will say that a property is ` lattice - independent ' if it it holds for all these three ` regular ' lattices ( square lattice , triangular lattice , honeycombe lattice ) .",
    "one possible way to describe a larger class of ` regular ' lattices for which our ` lattice - independent ' properties should hold , could ( but we do not want to discuss this issue in detail here ) be that they are transitive ( i.e. for each pair of points , there exists a euclidean isometry that maps the lattice onto itself and one of the two points onto the other ) and that rescaled simple random walk on this lattice converges to planar brownian motion .",
    "for instance , the lattice @xmath18 is not allowed .",
    "when @xmath19 denotes such a planar lattice , we denote by @xmath20 the number of self - avoiding paths of length @xmath0 in the lattice starting from a fixed point , and by @xmath21 its connectivity constant .",
    "a first striking prediction from theoretical physics is the following :    for any regular planar lattice @xmath22 , when @xmath7 , @xmath23    the first important feature is the rational exponent @xmath24 .",
    "the second one is that this result does not depend on the lattice i.e. , the first - order term is lattice - dependent while the second is `` universal '' .",
    "the following statement is almost equivalent to the previous prediction .",
    "suppose that we define under the same probability @xmath25 two independent self - avoiding paths @xmath26 and @xmath27 of length @xmath0 on the lattice @xmath28 ( the law of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the uniform probability on @xmath2 ) .    when @xmath7 , @xmath29   = n^{-11/32 + o(1 ) } .\\ ] ]    indeed , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are disjoint if and only if the concatenation of the two paths @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a self - avoiding path of length @xmath32 so that the non - intersection probability is exactly @xmath33 .",
    "a second question concerns the typical behaviour of a long self - avoiding path , chosen uniformly in @xmath2 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the diameter of @xmath26 .",
    "theoretical physics predicts that the typical diameter is of order @xmath35 .",
    "this had already been predicted using a different ( ` very non - rigorous ' ) argument by flory @xcite in the late 40 s . a formal way to describe this prediction is the following :    for all @xmath36 and all regular lattices , when @xmath7 , @xmath37\\right ] \\to 1   .\\ ] ]    one of the underlying beliefs that lead to these conjectures is that the measure on long self - avoiding paths , suitably rescaled , converges when the length goes to infinity , towards a measure on continuous curves , that posesses some invariance properties under conformal transformations .",
    "the counterparts of the previous predictions in terms of this limitting measure then go as follows : take two independent paths defined under the limitting measure , started at distance @xmath38 from each other .",
    "then , the probability that the two paths are disjoint decays like @xmath39 when @xmath40 . for the second prediction : the hausdorff dimension of a path defined under the limitting measure is almost surely @xmath41 .",
    "we now review some results predicted by theoretical physics concerning critical planar percolation .",
    "a more detailed acount on these conjectures for mathematicians can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a general introduction to percolation .",
    "let @xmath42 be fixed .",
    "for each edge between neighbouring points of the lattice , erase the edge with probability @xmath43 and keep it ( and call the edge open ) with probability @xmath44 independently for all edges .",
    "in other words , for each edge we toss a biased coin to decide whether it is erased or not .",
    "this procedure defines a random subgraph of the square grid .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the large - scale geometry of this subgraph depends a lot on the value of @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , there exists a critical value @xmath45 ( called the critical probability ) , such that if @xmath46 , there exists almost surely no unbounded connected component in the random subgraph , while if @xmath47 , there exists almost surely a unique unbounded connected component of open edges .",
    "it is not very difficult to see that the value @xmath45 of the critical probability is lattice - dependent .",
    "kesten has shown that for @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we are going to be interested in the geometry of large connected component when @xmath50 .",
    "in regular planar lattices at @xmath51 it is known that almost surely no infinite connected component exists . however",
    ", a simple duality argument shows that in the square grid , at @xmath52 , for any @xmath53 , with probability @xmath54 , there exists a path of open edges joining ( in that rectangle ) the bottom and top boundaries of a fixed @xmath55 rectangle .",
    "this loosely speaking shows that in a big box , with large probability , there exist connected components of diameter comparable to the size of the box .",
    "theoretical physics predicts that large - scale properties of the geometry of critical percolation ( i.e. , percolation on a planar lattice at its critical probability ) are lattice - independent ( even though the value of the critical probability is lattice - dependent ) , and , in the scaling limit , invariant under conformal transformations ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , physicists have produced explicit formulas that describe some of its features .",
    "a first prediction is the following : consider critical percolation restricted to an @xmath56 square ( in the square lattice , say ) , and choose the connected component @xmath57 with largest diameter ( among all connected components ) .",
    "the previous observation shows that the diameter of @xmath57 is of the order of magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "define the rescaled discrete outer perimeter of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the boundary of the unbounded connected component of the complement of @xmath57 in the plane .",
    "[ cb ] the law of @xmath60 converges when @xmath7 towards a law @xmath61 on continuous paths @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , @xmath61-almost surely : the hausdorff dimension of @xmath62 is @xmath63 , the path @xmath64 is not self - avoiding , and the outer boundary of @xmath62 has hausdorff dimension @xmath41 .",
    "a weaker version of the first part of this prediction is that for all @xmath65 , when @xmath7 , @xmath66 \\to    1 $ ] .",
    "a second prediction concerns the crossing probabilities of a quadrilateral .",
    "suppose that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and perform critical percolation in the rectangle @xmath69 \\times [ 0 , b_n]$ ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the respective integer parts of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the cross - ratio between the four corners of the @xmath75 rectangle ( more precisely , it is the value @xmath76 such that there exists a conformal mapping from the rectangle onto the upper half - plane , such that the left and right - hand side of the rectangle are mapped onto the intervals @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] ) .    when @xmath7 , the probability that there exists a path of open edges in the rectangle @xmath69 \\times [ 0,b_n]$ ] joining the left and right - hand sides of the boundary of the rectangle converges to @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the usual hypergeometric function .",
    "these results are believed to be lattice - independent .",
    "this second statement has been predicted by cardy @xcite , using and generalising conformal field theory considerations and ideas introduced in @xcite .",
    "note that this prediction is of a different nature than the previous ones .",
    "it gives an exact formula for an event in the scaling limit rather than just an exponent .",
    "assuming conformal invariance , this prediction can be reformulated in a half - plane as follows :    for all @xmath81 , the probability that there exists a crossing ( a path of open edges ) joining @xmath82 $ ] to @xmath83 $ ] in the upper half - plane converges when @xmath7 towards @xmath84 .",
    "carleson was the first to note that cardy s formula takes on a very simple form in an equilateral triangle .",
    "suppose @xmath85 are the vertices of an equilaterial triangle , say @xmath86 .    in the scaling limit (",
    "performing critical percolation on the grid @xmath87 , say , and letting @xmath88 ) , the law of the left - most point on @xmath89 $ ] that is connected ( in the triangle ) to @xmath90 $ ] is the uniform distribution on @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "we now come to the core of the present paper and state some of the results derived in the series of papers @xcite concerning critical exponents for planar brownian motions and simple random walks .",
    "these are mathematical results ( as opposed to the predictions reviewed in the previous section ) that had been predicted some 15 or 20 years ago .",
    "the proofs of these theorems ( that we shall briefly outline in the coming sections ) do use conformal invariance , complex analysis and univalent functions .",
    "suppose that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are two independent simple random walks on the lattice @xmath1 that are both started from the origin .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour ( when @xmath7 ) of the probability that the traces of @xmath93 and @xmath94 are disjoint .    [ 5/8 ] when @xmath7 , @xmath95   = n^{-5/8 + o(1 ) }   .\\ ] ]    this result had been predicted by duplantier - kwon @xcite , see also @xcite for another non - rigorous derivation based on quantum gravity ideas and predictions by khnizhnik , polyakov and zamolodchikov .",
    "note that , as opposed to self - avoiding walks and percolation cluster boundaries , the scaling limit of planar simple random walk is well - understood mathematically : it is planar brownian motion ( this is lattice - independent ) and it is invariant under conformal transformations ( modulo time - change ) .",
    "this is what makes it possible to prove theorem [ 5/8 ] as opposed to the analogous prediction for self - avoiding walks .",
    "the scaling limit analog of theorem [ 5/8 ] is the following :    @xcite [ 5/8bm ] let @xmath96 and @xmath97 denote two independent planar brownian motions started at distance 1 from each other .",

    "this theorem is in fact a consequence ( using results derived by lawler in @xcite ) of the determination of the following critical exponent ( called disconnection exponent ) :    if @xmath96 and @xmath97 are two independent planar brownian motions started from @xmath103 , then , when @xmath104 , @xmath105 \\cup b ' [ 0,t ] \\hbox { does not disconnect } 1 \\hbox { from } \\infty ] = t^{-1/3 + o(1 ) } .\\ ] ]    similarly , a consequence of theorem [ 5/8bm ] is that the hausdorff dimension of the set of cut points of the path @xmath101 $ ] is almost surely @xmath106 .",
    "analogously , we get that the set of pioneer points ( i.e. , points @xmath107 that are on the outer boundary of @xmath108 $ ] ) in a planar brownian path has hausdorff dimension @xmath63 , which - together with theorem [ mandelbrot ] - is reminiscent of prediction [ cb ] . also , the determination of more general exponents give the multifractal spectrum of the outer frontier of a brownian path .",

    "note that if we put @xmath267 , then @xmath268 so that @xmath204 can be interpreted as a ( translation of a ) complex bessel flow of dimension @xmath269 . if @xmath270 , it is easy to see , by comparison with a bessel process , that almost surely @xmath271 for all @xmath248 , in other words , @xmath272 .",

    "this process is well - defined modulo increasing time - reparametrization ( i.e. , if there exists a ( random ) continuous increasing @xmath276 such that for all @xmath194 , @xmath277 , then we say that the two processes @xmath111 and @xmath162 are equal ) .    for the remainder of this paper , we will assume that @xmath278 as this case exhibits many very interesting properties .",
    "it is possible to compute explicitely certain probabilities .",

    "then , the law of @xmath284 is independent of the choice of @xmath282 $ ] , it satisfies cardy s formula and it is invariant under restriction .    again , this property is only valid when @xmath285 and there exists a more general version in terms of processes @xcite .      from theorem",
    "[ rest ] , theorem [ univ2 ] and the strong markov property , it follows that the chordal process @xmath256 can be reinterpreted in terms of reflected brownian motions .",
    "in particular , the law of @xmath286 is that of the @xmath156-hull of a stopped brownian motion with oblique reflection .",
    "more generally , finite - dimensional marginals of the chordal @xmath238 process can for instance be constructed as follows ( other more general statements with other stopping times hold as well ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath287 is a decreasing family of closed subsets of @xmath240 such that @xmath288 are simply connected .",
    "when @xmath256 is chordal @xmath238 in @xmath240 ( started at @xmath103 and aiming at infinity ) , we put , for all @xmath289 , @xmath290    let @xmath291 denote a simply connected compact subset of the upper half - plane such that @xmath292 is simply connected and let @xmath293 . define a reflected brownian motion @xmath294 in @xmath295 with oblique reflection angle ( angle @xmath172 on the part of the boundary between @xmath76 and @xmath296 and reflection @xmath297 between @xmath298 and @xmath76 ) as the conformal image in @xmath295 of reflected brownian motion in @xmath173 .",
    "if @xmath299 is a compact set , define the stopping time @xmath300 at which @xmath301 $ ] intersects @xmath299 for the first time , and the hull @xmath302 of @xmath303 $ ] in @xmath173 .",
    "now , define recursively ( using each time independent brownian motions ) , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , @xmath306    [ approx ] the laws of @xmath307 and of @xmath308 are identical .",
    "in particular , this implies that the law of @xmath309 is identical to that of @xmath310 and therefore is independent of @xmath44 and @xmath311 .",
    "this can be viewed as a way to reformulate the restriction property for @xmath238 in terms of reflected brownian motions only .",
    "so far , there is no direct proof of this fact that does not use the link with schramm s process .",
    "radial and chordal schramm processes with parameter 6 are very closely related",
    ". the cci property and the restriction property in their ` process ' versions can be very non - rigorously described as follows : the evolution of @xmath226 ( for radial and chordal @xmath238 ) depends on @xmath226 only in a local way i.e. , suppose that at time @xmath312 , @xmath226 is increasing near some point @xmath313 , then the evolution of @xmath226 immediately after @xmath312 depends only on how @xmath314 looks like in the neighbourhood of @xmath76 ( for a rigorous version of this statement , see @xcite ) .",
    "the link between radial and chordal @xmath238 ( and this is only true when @xmath237 ) is that this local evolution is the same for radial and chordal @xmath238 , see @xcite .",
    "this also leads to a description of the finite - dimensional marginal laws of radial @xmath238 in terms of hulls of reflected brownian motion .",
    "we now give a very brief outline of the proof of theorem [ 5/8 ] . as a consequence of the results stated in the last two sections ,",
    "hulls of brownian paths at certain stopping times can be also constructed in an a priori completely different way using @xmath238 .",
    "the latter turns out to be much better suited to compute probabilities involving only the shape of its complement , as @xmath238 is a process that is ` continuously growing to the outside ' , whereas brownian motion does incursions inside its own hull , so that for instance the point at which the brownian hull ` grows ' makes a lot of jumps .",
    "it is very easy to show that theorem [ 5/8 ] is a consequence of the following fact that we shall now derive : let @xmath96 and @xmath97 denote two independent planar brownian motions started from @xmath103 and @xmath65 , and killed when they hit the unit circle .",
    "then , when @xmath88 , @xmath315 = \\eps^{5/4 + o(1 ) } .\\ ] ] to derive ( [ 5/4 ] ) , note first that if @xmath316 denotes the harmonic measure of @xmath116 at @xmath317 in @xmath318 ( here @xmath319 is the hull of @xmath96 ) , then @xmath320   = h _ { k(b)}.\\ ] ] hence , using theorem [ univ ] , shows that @xmath321 =   e [ h_{k(b ) } ] =   e [ h_{k_t } ] \\ ] ] where @xmath236 is radial @xmath238 stopped as in theorem [ sle6 ] .",
    "the construction of @xmath236 via loewner s equation makes it possible to study explicitly the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath322 $ ] when @xmath88 by computing the highest eigenvalue computation of a differential operator , see @xcite . from this , ( [ 5/4 ] ) follows .",
    "similar ( though more involved ) arguments lead to theorem [ mandelbrot ] and to the determination of many other such critical exponents that are defined in terms of planar brownian paths @xcite .",
    "suppose that one performs critical bond percolation ( @xmath323 ) in the discrete half - plane @xmath324 .",
    "decide that all edges of the type @xmath325 $ ] when @xmath76 is on the real axis are erased when @xmath326 and open when @xmath327 .",
    "then , there exists a unique infinite cluster @xmath328 formed by the negative half - axis and the union of all clusters that are attached to it .",
    "we now explore the outer boundary of this cluster , starting from the point @xmath329 .",
    "in other words , we follow the left - most possible path that is not allowed to cross open edges as shown in the picture below ( for convenience , we draw the line that stays at ` distance ' @xmath330 from @xmath328 ) .",
    "the open edges are the thin plain lines , and the exploration process is the thick plain line .    note that this exploration process is almost symmetric because of the self - duality property of the planar lattice : it is ( almost ) the same than exploring the outer boundary of the cluster of ` open ' edges in the dual lattice ( i.e. duals of closed edges in the original lattice - the thick dashed edges in the picture ) attached to the ` positive half - line ' @xmath331 ( other choices of the lattice make this exploration process perfectly symmetric ) .    the conformal invariance conjecture leads naturally to the conjecture @xcite that in the scaling limit , this exploration process can be described using loewner s differential equation in the upper half - plane , and that the driving process @xmath254 is a continuous symmetric markov process with stationary increments i.e. @xmath332 for some parameter @xmath234 .",
    "it is then easy to identify @xmath237 as the only possible candidate ( looking for instance at the probability of crossing a square , see @xcite ) , and the restriction property gives additional support to this conjecture . in particular , note that cardy s formula for schramm s process with parameter @xmath333 would indeed correspond to the crossing probability .",
    "so far , there is no mathematical proof of the fact that this exploration process converges to schramm s process .",
    "however , theorem [ approx ] and the fact that the exploration process can be viewed as a discrete random walk reflected on its past hull gives at least a heuristic hand - waving justification .",
    "the only discrete models that have been mathematically shown to exhibit some conformal invariance properties in the scaling limit - apart from simple random walks - are those studied by kenyon in @xcite , namely loop - erased walks and uniform spanning trees .",
    "these are conjectured to correspond to schramm s processes with parameters 2 and 8 , see @xcite . for partial results concerning percolation scaling limit and its conformal invariance ,",
    "see @xcite .    for some other critical exponents related to hausdorff dimensions of conformally invariant exceptional subsets of the planar brownian curve ( such as pivoting cut points for instance ) that we do not know ( yet ? ) the value of , see @xcite .",
