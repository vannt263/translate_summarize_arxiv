    ". therefore , this star might be of type dc , or possibly a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "if this star is magnetic , the main constituent of its atmosphere could be helium , because helium , contrary to hydrogen , has no stationary components and hence has no detectable features over a wide range of field strengths ( schmelcher , priv.comm . ) .",
    "he  0309@xmath12105 was already observed by sefako et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . on the basis of its colours ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) derived from @xmath4 photometry",
    "they were not able to classify the object .",
    "however , our synthetic colours derived from prism plates of the he s and confirmed by spectroscopy yield @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , which place he  0309@xmath12105 well in the regime of white dwarfs in the two - colour diagram . together with its featureless spectrum it is therefore classified as dc .",
    "c@xmath7 bands might be the reason for weak flux depressions at 4700 and 5100 .",
    "therefore , he  0442@xmath1302 might rather be a dq than a dc .",
    "he  1146@xmath10109 displays strong c@xmath7 bands at 4670 and 5140 .",
    "since no other features can be detected in the spectrum , the star is classified as dq .",
    "this star has a composite spectrum , which shows no clear features bluewards of 5800 , and strong tio bands redwards of 5800 .",
    "there are hints for absorption features at 3730 and 4026 , which could be attributed to helium , and one at 5170 , which could possibly be due to magnesium and iron .",
    "we assume that he  2237@xmath13630 is a binary star with a helium - rich white dwarf component and a m - dwarf component .",
    "we have presented a model atmosphere analysis of cool helium - rich white dwarfs found in the hamburg / eso survey for which follow - up spectroscopy has been performed . since the selection criterium for these stars",
    "was confined to a continuum slope similar to qsos , and no strong absorption lines , this sample of helium - rich white dwarfs is biased towards  below 20000k .    among the 33 analyzed db stars , we found 4 dba , if we include he  2147@xmath10950 and he  2237@xmath10509 with a somewhat uncertain identification of h@xmath8 , and 3 dbaz stars ; hence , a fraction of 21% in our sample shows traces of hydrogen .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of shipman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who found 19% dba white dwarfs in their complete sample of cool db stars from the palomar - green survey .",
    "especially the dbaz stars are important in the context of the ongoing discussion of accretion of hydrogen and metals from the interstellar medium . since the diffusion times of metals in helium - rich atmospheres",
    "are short compared to evolutionary time scales ( paquette et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it is generally accepted that metals can not be of primordial origin but must be accreted from the interstellar medium .",
    "compared to the accretion - diffusion model of dupuis et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which predicts element abundances in cool white dwarf atmospheres in consideration of accretion from the interstellar medium , the derived ca abundances for the dbaz stars found and the magnesium and iron abundance for he  0446@xmath12531 are consistent with accretion in solar element proportions at high accretion rates . for he",
    "0446@xmath12531 it is also possible to determine metal - to - metal ratios .",
    "whereas the fe / mg ratio falls within the predicted range , the fe / ca and mg / ca ratios are below their respective lower limits , but given the large errors they might still be compatible with accretion in solar element proportions .",
    "contrary to the metals , which sink down in the atmospheres and disappear very rapidly , hydrogen has the tendency to float on top of a helium - rich atmosphere .",
    "it is therefore accumulated with time in the surface layers .",
    "thus one would expect a metal - to - hydrogen ratio , which is below the solar value . as already observed in other helium - rich metal - line white dwarfs ( see dupuis et al .",
    "@xcite for a compilation ) the ca / h ratio is larger by a factor of @xmath9 to @xmath10 than the solar value for the new dbaz stars , supporting the hypothesis that accretion of hydrogen is somehow reduced compared to accretion of metals .",
    "the mechanism most widely discussed for this `` hydrogen screening '' is the propeller mechanism of illarionov & sunyaev ( @xcite ) , originally developed for accretion of interstellar matter onto neutron stars .",
    "wesemael & truran ( @xcite ) first discussed it in the context of white dwarfs .",
    "they proposed that metals are accreted in the form of grains onto a slowly rotating , weakly magnetized ( @xmath11  g ) white dwarf , whereas ionized hydrogen is repelled at the alfvn radius .",
    "however , it remains to be demonstrated that the necessary conditions for rotation , magnetic field and hydrogen - ionizing radiation are fulfilled to make the propeller mechanism operate .",
    "the hamburg / eso survey has been supported by the dfg under grants re  353/33 and re  353/40 .",
    "work on the hamburg quasar survey in kiel is supported by a grant from the dfg under ko  738/10 - 3 .",
