    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are bright , point - like , extragalactic sources with x - ray luminosities in the range from a few @xmath4 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 to as high as 10@xmath7 ergs s@xmath6 ( e.g. , swartz et al . 2004 and references therein ) . the nature of the physical process producing such high x - ray output is not completely understood , but there is now strong evidence that some ulxs are accretion - powered systems containing a black hole .",
    "what remains more controversial is the mass of the accretor .",
    "current arguments suggest that these sources are either stellar - mass black holes ( mass range : 3 - 50 m@xmath8 ) accreting via a super - eddington mechanism ( e.g. , krding et al .",
    "2002 ; king et al . 2001",
    "; begelman 2002 ) , or that they comprise an intermediate - mass black hole ( mass range : a few@xmath4(100 - 1000)m@xmath8 ) accreting at sub - eddington accretion rates ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "it is possible that the population of ulxs is an inhomogeneous sample with both types of sources present .",
    "a search for intermediate - mass black holes is important as they are often required as building blocks to explain the formation of the super - massive black holes ( volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ; davies et al . 2011 )",
    "that reside at the centers of almost all massive galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this work",
    "we focus on the ulx ngc 5408 x-1 , one of the promising candidates for an intermediate - mass black hole ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2009 ) . here",
    "we present evidence for the detection of quasi - periodic dips in its x - ray light curve that likely trace the orbital motion of the system .",
    "there are now two detections of periodicities from long term ( @xmath9 a few hundred days ) x - ray monitoring of ulxs which may reflect the orbital motion of these systems : a 62 day modulation in m82 x-1 detected with rxte ( kaaret et al .",
    "2007 ) , and a 115.5 day period in ngc 5408 x-1 obtained from _ swift _ data ( strohmayer 2009 , s09 hereafter ) .",
    "the main results of s09 are : ( a ) the discovery of a quasi - sinusoidal modulation of the x - ray flux with a period of 115.5@xmath14 days and ( b ) that the modulation amplitude decreases with increasing energy .",
    "the present work utilizes additional data acquired by _",
    "swift _ over a much longer temporal baseline ( more than twice as long as used by s09 ) and can be regarded as an extension of the work by s09 .",
    "the phenomenon of periodic orbital x - ray modulations within the context of galactic x - ray binaries has been well - studied for over 30 years now ( e.g. , white & holt 1982 ; mason 1986 ) .",
    "the basic idea is that there is a distribution of obscuring material around the x - ray emitting region and as the x - ray source orbits the center of mass of the binary , our line of sight intercepts varying amounts of the intervening material resulting in the observed modulation ( e.g. , parmar & white 1988 ; armitage & livio 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , these x - ray variations are expected to recur with the orbital period of the binary . however , due to the turbulent nature of the accretion process and irregularities within the material surrounding the x - ray source , these modulations may not be strictly periodic ( see , for example , smale et al . 1988 ; barnard et al .",
    "2001 ; kuulkers et al . 2012 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they provide an excellent means to track the orbital motion of the x - ray source .",
    "moreover , the nature of the obscuring medium , i.e. , its distribution around the x - ray source as well as its density and ionization state , dictates the observed modulation profiles .",
    "in the case of the high - inclination ( @xmath2 60@xmath3 ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , periodic decreases in the x - ray flux ( x - ray dips ) extending over 10 - 30% of their orbital phase have been observed ( e.g. , white et al . 1995 ) . in these cases",
    "it is generally accepted that the x - ray variations are due to absorption in the `` bulge '' at the edge of the accretion disk , where the accretion stream from the roche - lobe filling companion star impacts the accretion disk ( white & holt 1982 ; bisikalo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "such variations have been predominantly observed in the x - ray light curves of high - inclination neutron star lmxbs , viz .",
    ", xb 1916 - 053 ( e.g. , boirin et al .",
    "2004 ) , xb 1254 - 690 ( e.g. , smale et al . 2002 ) , exo 0748 - 676 ( church et al . 1998 ) .    on the other hand , sharp drops in the x - ray flux lasting less than one percent of the orbital phase have been observed in a small sample of accreting black hole binaries .",
    "these include the lmxb gro j1655 - 40 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) and the high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) cygnus x-1 ( baluciska - church et al . 2000 ; feng & cui 2002 ) . in the case of gro j1655 - 40",
    "the sharp dips last a very small fraction of the orbital period ( a few minutes compared to its orbital period of 2.62 days ) and are confined between the orbital phases of 0.7 and 0.9 ( phase 0 corresponds to the superior conjunction of the x - ray source , i.e. , when the companion star is in front of the black hole with respect to our line of sight ) .",
    "the short duration of these dips suggests that the absorbing medium is likely filamentary in nature .",
    "based on 3-dimensional numerical simulations of the accretion stream impacting the disk in compact binaries ( armitage & livio 1998 ) , kuulkers et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that the likely scenario operating in gro j1655 - 40 is that the accretion stream from the roche lobe overflow of the stellar companion splashes onto the disk rim , creating a local distribution of material above and below the plane of the disk .",
    "also , the numerical work by armitage & livio ( 1998 ) predicts that the sharp dips should occur preferentially around the orbital phase of 0.8 ( the stream - disk impact site ) , similar to those observed in gro j1655 - 40 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "this suggested that the absorber in the case of gro j1655 - 40 is a local distribution ( between orbital phases of 0.7 - 0.9 ) of clumps above and below the accretion disk and is then somewhat different compared to the dipping in neutron star lmxbs .",
    "the hmxb cygnus x-1 exhibits two types of `` sharp '' x - ray dips ( type - a and type - b as classified by feng & cui 2002 ) .",
    "the type - a dips are energy - dependent , i.e. , accompanied by an increase in the hardness ratio while the type - b dips are energy - independent , i.e. , no evidence for an increase in the hardness ratio .",
    "while the type - a dips are preferentially distributed roughly about the superior conjunction of the x - ray source , type - b dips occur randomly over the binary orbit .",
    "the type - a dips are attributed to being produced due to absorption by density enhancements ( clumps or `` blobs , '' in the vernacular ) in an inhomogeneous wind from the companion star . on the other hand , type - b dips",
    "are suggested to be caused by partial covering of an extended x - ray source by an opaque screen ( feng & cui 2002 ) . numerical simulations of the accretion flow of wind - fed systems including hmxbs have shown that the tidal force from the compact object can distort the companion star and give rise to a focused wind in the direction of the compact source ( blondin et al .",
    "this tidal wind then develops into a roche lobe overflow as the surface of the stellar companion reaches its equipotential surface .",
    "the coriolis force deflects the accretion stream such that it does not directly impact the compact companion but goes around it ( see figure 7 of blondin et al .",
    "the density in these tidal streams can be as high as 20 - 30 times the ambient density and therefore , in principle , can serve as an opaque absorber of the x - rays ( see also , baluciska - church et al .",
    "furthermore , these simulations predict that systems with dominant tidal streams should show evidence for pronounced dipping around the orbital phase of @xmath9 0.6 .",
    "a study of the distribution of the sharp x - ray dips from cygnus x-1 as a function of orbital phase has shown that there are indeed two peaks : the primary peak corresponds to phase 0 , i.e. , superior conjunction of the x - ray source and a secondary peak at a phase of 0.6 ( baluciska - church et al . 2000 ) .    in summary ,",
    "two types ( based on the duration of the individual dips ) of periodic / quasi - periodic x - ray modulations have been observed in accreting x - ray binaries : 1 ) broad dips lasting 10 - 30% of the orbital period have been seen in a sample of neutron star lmxbs and 2 ) sharp dips lasting less than one percent of the orbital period have been observed from the black hole lmxb and hmxb , gro j1655 - 40 and cygnus x-1 , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that the location of the absorber is different in the neutron star lmxbs ( bulge at the edge of the accretion disk ) compared with gro j1655 - 40 ( clumps above the accretion disk ) and cygnus x-1 ( accretion stream ) .    here",
    "we report on a study of the x - ray monitoring data from ngc 5408 x-1 obtained with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) . in particular , we present evidence for sharp dips in the x - ray light curve and interpret the observed variability in the context of binary motion .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the details of the _",
    "swift_/xrt data used for this work . in section 3",
    "we study the long - term ( @xmath9 a few hundred days ) timing behavior of the source .",
    "in particular , we report the detection of the quasi - periodic , sharp x - ray dips along with the smooth , quasi - sinusoidal x - ray modulation . both modulations are consistent with the dipping phenomena seen in accreting galactic x - ray binaries",
    ". however , to avoid confusion and to be able to clearly distinguish between the two kinds of modulations we will refer to the sharp x - ray dips as simply dips or sharp dips while we refer to the smooth component as the smooth quasi - sinusoidal x - ray modulation . in section 4 we present spectral evidence for a change in the physical properties of the system .",
    "we also study the spectral differences between the sharp dips and the other portions of the data .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results on the orbital motion of the x - ray source in section 5 .",
    "we summarize our work in section 6 .",

    "the background count rates with their respective error bars are also shown ( red points and black error bars within ) .",
    "the most prominent feature of the light curve is the quasi - periodic recurrence of the dips .",
    "these are highlighted with green circles . the vertical line labeled as s09 marks the last observation used by strohmayer ( 2009 ) . the vertical line labeled as `` day 1100 '' corresponds to the approximate epoch at which the physical properties of the system may have changed ( see  4.1 ) .",

    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard _ swift _ began monitoring the ulx ngc 5408 x-1 in 2008 april as part of an approved cycle 4 program ( pi : strohmayer ) .",
    "we include in our analysis all the observations obtained since the beginning of that program through 2011 august 30 .",
    "the observing cadence has varied over this timespan of @xmath0 3.4 yrs ( 1240 days ) , but on average the source was observed , when viewable , for a few ks once every 4 days .",
    "gaps in the coverage due to _ swift _ observing constraints occurred from 2008 september 26 - 2008 december 16",
    "( 81 days ) , 2009 september 25 - 2009 december 15 ( 81 days ) , 2010 september 26 - 2009 december 20 ( 85 days ) and 2011 march 27 - 2011 may 1 ( 35 days ) .",
    "this provided a total of 305 pointed observations with a cumulative exposure of @xmath0 500 ks distributed over a temporal baseline of @xmath0 1240 days .",
    "all the observations were carried out in the photon counting ( pc ) data mode .",
    "we began our analysis with the level-1 raw xrt event files ( data as stored in the _ swift _ archive ) .",
    "each of the event files was reduced with the standard _",
    "xrtpipeline _ data reduction tool .",
    "one crucial consideration during the reduction process was to mitigate the impact of bad pixels / columns on the xrt ccd . when a source is positioned on such pixels",
    ", it can lead to an incorrect measurement of the flux .",
    "furthermore , the bad pixels can result in an erroneous estimate of the response ( effective area ) of the instrument .",
    "the university of leicester s xrt data analysis web page ( http://www.swift.ac.uk/analysis/xrt/exposuremaps.php ) provides a detailed discussion of this problem .",
    "the solution is to create exposure maps that account for the presence of bad pixels .",
    "we used _ xrtexpomap _ ( _ xrtpipeline _ with the qualifier _",
    "xrtexpomap = yes _ ) to create exposure maps for each of the individual observations .",
    "these exposure maps were then used to correct the light curves ( using _ xrtlccorr _ ) and the ancillary response files ( effective area ) ( using _ xrtmkarf _ ) of each of the observations .    as recommended in the xrt s user guide , we only used events with grades 0 - 12 for further processing .",
    "we then used _ xselect _ to extract light - curves and spectra from the individual observations .",
    "we extracted source light - curves and spectra from a circular region of radius 47.1  centered around the source .",
    "this particular value was chosen to include roughly 90% ( at 1.5 kev ) of the light from the source ( estimated from the fractional encircled energy of the xrt ) .",
    "a background region , free of other sources , was extracted in a nearby region . given the low individual exposure times , to better estimate the background , we chose a circular region of twice the radius of the source , i.e. , four times the source area .",

    "the background is almost always negligible compared to the source count rate .",
    "roughly 40% of these observations , i.e. , the first 113 observations of the present dataset , were analyzed by s09 . the vertical line marked as s09 indicates the end of the observations used by s09",

    "s09 reported a 115.5 day period in this data and concluded that it likely represents the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the additional data provides new insights about the system .",
    "a prominent feature of the full light curve is the quasi - periodic recurrence of deep , sharp x - ray dips ( though with non - zero x - ray intensity during the dip minima ) .",
    "these dips are highlighted with green circles in figure 1 . with the available temporal baseline of @xmath0 1240 days",
    ", we detected five epochs of dips that recur roughly every 243 days .",

    "11 phase bins were used for the above distribution .",

    "[ fig : figure3 ]    in this section we present evidence for weakening of the 115.5 day quasi - sinusoidal x - ray modulation during the second half ( @xmath0 last 600 days ) of the light curve shown in figure 1 .",
    "we started our analysis by dividing the light curve into roughly two equal segments .",
    "we then directly compared the lomb - scargle periodograms ( scargle 1982 ; horne & baliunas 1986 ) of the two segments .",
    "we used all the photons in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy range for this analysis .",
    "the two periodograms with their respective light curves are shown in figure 2 .",

    "the bottom left panel shows the light curve of the second half of figure 1 ( note the x - axis ) and the bottom right panel shows the periodogram of the second half of the complete light curve .",
    "the highest peak in the periodogram of the first half of the light curve ( top right panel of figure 2 ) corresponds to a period of 112.6@xmath14 days .",
    "this is consistent with the value reported by s09 ( also see han et al .",
    "furthermore , such a peak is not evident in the periodogram of the second half of the data .",
    "we note that the reason for this difference is unlikely to be purely statistical as the two portions of the light curve have comparable signal - to - noise ratios , temporal baseline ( @xmath0 600 days each ) and sampling rate ( with the exception of the last continuous segment of the light curve which has a higher sampling rate of @xmath0 once per day ) .",
    "it is very likely that the drop in the amplitude of the modulation in the second half of the light curve is physical .",

    "each point is an average of 5 neighboring bins . both the smooth components ( period of 115.5 days ) and the sharp dips ( quasi - period of 243@xmath123 days ) can be clearly seen .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ]      we have detected a total of 27 dips ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "each of these dips was assigned a phase assuming a period of 243 days , the average time interval between successive epochs of dipping . a normalized distribution of the phases of these dips is shown in figure 3 .",
    "a normalized distribution was obtained by dividing each value by the number of times each phase bin was observed .",
    "this was done to eliminate the bias of preferentially sampling certain phase bins .",
    "since the absolute orbital phase of the system is not known we arbitrarily assign the zero phase to correspond to the start of the monitoring observations .",
    "one can see that the dip phase distribution is roughly gaussian with a width ( fwhm ) of @xmath0 0.24 .    another analysis tool to understand the nature of the modulations is epoch folding of the light curve . in the case of ngc 5408 x-1 ,",
    "we have detected five epochs of sharp dips .",
    "if these are associated with the orbital period of the binary then the implied period is likely in the range 243@xmath123 days .",
    "the variance ( 23 days ) on this value is rather large , thus , the precise value of the orbital period to use for folding the data is not known . therefore , we used values between 220 - 270 days and then chose the value that resulted in the highest modulation amplitude .",
    "this value is 230 days .",
    "furthermore , it was noted previously that the smooth , quasi - sinusoidal modulation disappears / weakens in the latter half of the data .",
    "therefore , we used only the portion of the complete light curve that shows strong evidence for both components , i.e. , the first @xmath0 700 days of the data .",

    "s09 reported that the amplitude of the quasi - sinusoidal x - ray modulation was energy dependent , with the modulation amplitude decreasing with increasing energy . here",
    "we attempt to systematically quantify the variability as a function of energy .",
    "the procedure we carry out is as follows .",
    "we obtain folded light curves in different energy bands . more specifically , keeping the upper limit of the bandpass constant at 8.0 kev , we vary the lower limit of the bandpass from 0.3 to 2.0 kev . again , since the 115.5 day modulation weakens during the later half of the monitoring we used only the first @xmath0 700 days of data .",
    "a few folded profiles along with the best - fitting model ( solid line ) are shown in figure 5 .",
    "two cycles are shown for clarity .",
    "here we used only 13 phase bins per cycle as our goal is to model only the overall quasi - sinusoidal modulation and not to study the subtle features within the modulation profiles .",
    "to each of these profiles we fit a model that includes two fourier components ( the fundamental and the first harmonic ) , i.e. , i = a + b@xmath102@xmath11(@xmath12-@xmath13 ) + c@xmath104@xmath11(@xmath12-@xmath14 ) .",

    ". a closer look at the unfolded spectra reveals that the disk black body component dominates at energies below 2 kev while the powerlaw component dictates the nature of the spectrum at higher energies ; and the photoelectric absorption is stronger at lower energies .",
    "therefore , the apparent differences between the two spectra can either be due to a change in the absorption column density ( _ phabs _ ) or to changes in the disk properties , viz . , the disk temperature , and/or the disk normalization .",

    "[ fig : figure8 ]    the dip spectra of x - ray binaries are often characterized using more complex models involving either an absorbed - plus - unabsorbed ( hereafter , a+u ) approach ( e.g. , parmar et al .",

    "a simple interpretation in the context of this model is that during dips the direct x - ray emission is completely obscured / absorbed , and what remains is largely scattered ( in an energy independent fashion ) into our line of sight from more extended regions around the source .",
    "partial covering models have been quite successful in describing the spectral evolution with intensity during dipping ( see for example church et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this approach the spectral evolution",
    "as dipping becomes stronger is accounted for by the progressive covering of , typically , one of the spectral components .",
    "the implication is that the progressively covered component is spatially extended compared to the other component .",
    "a perceived strength in favor of these models is that scattering ",
    "the details of which are not often specified in the a+u approach  is not required . in the case of lmxb neutron star",
    "dippers it is the coronal ( power - law ) component that is progressively covered , whereas in some black hole systems successful modeling requires partial covering of the thermal ( disk black body ) component ( church 2001 ) .",
    "we found that the dip spectrum of ngc 5408 x-1 could not be well described by progressive covering of either spectral component by itself , but that progressive covering of the sum of both components provided as good a fit as the a+u modeling .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold , 1 ) the dip spectrum is consistent with being energy independent , that is , it has the same shape as the non - dip spectra , and 2 ) both spectral components contribute a comparable amount to the total flux .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to partially cover only one component and still maintain the same spectral shape .",
    "partial covering of just the power - law component does a better job than covering of only the _ diskpn _ component , but in each case the fits are not as good as the a+u case . covering of the sum of the components provides a good fit .",
    "the implication in this case is that the emission components are extended but co - spatial .",
    "the dipping then corresponds to complete obscuration of about 4/5 of the extended source ( in an average sense over all dips ) .",
    "the conclusion from either modeling framework is that an absorbed component is not seen directly , only an unabsorbed component .",
    "finally , we note that due to the limited statistical quality of the dip spectrum and the fact that only a single dip spectrum could be meaningfully extracted , it is difficult to be more precise about the exact physical nature of the dipping .        * figure 9 : * top panel : the confidence contours of the total hydrogen column densities along the line of sight ( n@xmath85 ) before ( x - axis ) and after ( y - axis ) day 1100 .",

    "as discussed in  1 , such orbit - phase dependent x - ray dipping has been well - studied in the case of accreting x - ray binaries and is usually ascribed to periodic obscuration of the x - ray source by an intervening medium , viz . , a bulge at the edge of the accretion disk , the wind from the companion star or the accretion stream . in those cases",

    ", we note that this is unlikely to be the case due to the fact that the sharp dips are not strictly periodic .",
    "that is , the large variance on the dip period ( see figure 3 ) strongly indicates that we are not seeing eclipses .",
    "if these two arguments are correct then a rough constraint on the inclination angle can be derived , as the inclination angle has to be less than some upper limit so that eclipses are not seen but must be large enough so that the absorbing / obscuring effects of the disk bulges are not completely eliminated . assuming the donor star fills its roche lobe , an upper limit on the inclination angle ( such that eclipses are not seen ) can be derived that depends on the orbital period and the mass ratio of the binary ( see eggleton 1983 ; rappaport & joss 1986 for the appropriate formulae ) . for an orbital period of 243 days with a b0i donor of @xmath0 10m@xmath8 ,",

    "the basic idea here is that the accretion disk is tilted or warped with respect to the orbital plane of the binary .",
    "the tidal effects of the companion star then force the accretion disk to precess about an axis normal to the binary orbit . as the tilted disk precesses , the effective area of the disk obscuring the central x - ray source can vary , producing modulations at or near the precession period .",
    "furthermore , the radiation force from the x - ray source can warp the outer regions of the accretion disk ( ogilvie & dubus 2001 ; ogilvie 2002 ) leading to two spatially distinct density enhancements .",
    "this might possibly account for the twin - peaked x - ray modulation curve of ngc 5408 x-1 . in summary ,",
    "the theory of tilted , warped accretion disks may be adaptable to the present scenario to perhaps explain the observed properties .",
    "we have presented results from long - term x - ray ( 0.3 - 8.0 kev ) monitoring of the ulx ngc 5408 x-1 using _",
    "our primary results are : ( 1 ) the discovery of sharp , energy - independent dips ( a total of 5 dip epochs ) in the x - ray intensity that recur roughly every 243 days and ( 2 ) the detection of a smooth , quasi - sinusoidal modulation of the x - rays which appears to weaken during the second half of the monitoring program .",
    "we interpret these findings in the context of orbital motion in a roch - lobe overflow binary with a period comparable to the dip - recurrence period ( 243@xmath123 days ; see figure 10 ) , however , it is also possible that a precessing accretion disk ( a `` super - orbital '' phenomenon ) can cause a similar x - ray modulation .",
    "further x - ray monitoring of ngc 5408 x-1 with _ swift _ is warranted to more firmly establish that the x - ray dips are indeed associated with the orbital period of the binary .",

    "<S> , this implies that ngc 5408 x-1 is in a binary with an orbital period of 243@xmath123 days , in contrast to the 115.5 day quasi - sinusoidal period previously reported by strohmayer ( 2009 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the overall x - ray modulation within the framework of accretion via roche lobe overflow of the donor star . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if the x - ray modulation is caused by vertically structured obscuring material in the accretion disk , this would imply a high value for the inclination of the orbit . a comparison with estimates from accreting x - ray binaries suggests an inclination @xmath2 70@xmath3 . </S>",
