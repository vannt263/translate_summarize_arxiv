    "it has been well established that the luminosity function ( lf ) of young star clusters is profoundly different from that of old globular clusters ( gcs ) . where the latter is peaked ( when presented in logarithmic luminosity bins or in magnitude bins ) ,",
    "the former rises down to the detection limit . when approximating the lf by a power law function of the form    @xmath8    many studies find @xmath9 for clusters in widely varying environments ( for overviews see * ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the values found for @xmath10 are often slightly higher ( i.e the lf is steeper , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the range is rather large ( @xmath11 ) to be explained by statistical fluctuations or photometric uncertainties .    the lf is often related to the cluster initial mass function ( cimf ) . however , the relation between the lf and the @xmath12 is not one - to - one , since the lf consists of clusters of different ages and evolutionary fading causes clusters of the same mass , but with different ages , to contribute at different luminosities in the lf .",
    "the empirically determined @xmath12 seems also well described by a power law , with an index of @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the spread between different studies much smaller than that found for the lf .",
    "although the lfs of the individual cluster systems are most of the time within a few @xmath13 compatible with a @xmath0 power law , a comparison between the different results shows that the deviations from the @xmath0 power law are not randomly scattered , but instead show some systematic variations , in the sense that the lf is    1 .",
    "_ steeper at higher luminosities _ ; 2 .   _ steeper in redder filters _ .",
    "the steepening with increasing luminosity is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where we show results of power law fits to lfs of clusters in different galaxies taken from literature .",
    "the horizontal bars indicate the fit range used and the vertical bars give the uncertainties in the power law index . from this a decrease of @xmath14 ( i.e. steepening ) with increasing luminosity",
    "this suggests that the @xmath12 is not a universal continuous power law .",
    "if it was a continuous power law with the same index at all ages and in all galaxies , all lfs should be power laws with the same index .",
    "age dependent extinction or bursts in the formation rate would not cause a difference between the cimf and the lf .",
    "an addition of identical power laws always results in the same power law .",
    "luminosity dependent extinction could cause a deviation from a @xmath0 power law .",
    "this will be addressed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the fact that the lf gets steeper at the bright - end is an indication that the cimf is truncated at some upper mass @xmath15 . when an abrupt truncation of the cimf is assumed , it is possible to roughly estimate the index of the bright - end of the lf .",
    "assume that the cimf is fully populated , i.e. the mass of the most massive cluster actually formed , @xmath16 , is equal to @xmath15 . then assume a constant formation history of clusters : @xmath17constant .",
    "the luminosities of these clusters , @xmath18 , are age dependent .",
    "the light - to - mass ratio , or the flux of a cluster of constant mass , scales roughly with age as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 depending on the wavelength @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 .",
    "the same arguments hold for the luminosities of the 2@xmath23 , 3@xmath24 , etc .",
    "most massive clusters , such that the bright - end of the lf is    @xmath25    for the @xmath26-band @xmath27 @xcite , such that for the @xmath26-band lf the index at the bright - end is @xmath28 . for the @xmath29-band @xmath30 and then equation  ( [ eq : zeta ] ) predicts a logarithmic slope of @xmath31 , i.e. shallower(steeper ) at blue(red ) wavelengths .",
    "the faint - end of the lf should still be a power law with index @xmath0 at all wavelengths or flatter if mass dependent disruption is important .",
    "this double power law shape for the lf was found by and @xcite for the lfs of clusters in m51 and the antennae , respectively .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we will model the lf in more detail and show that also this double power law shape is not the best approximation of the lf .",
    "in order to understand the luminosity function ( lf ) of star clusters we create semi - analytic cluster population models . for this the distribution function of initial masses ( @xmath32 ) with age needs to be defined first .",
    "we define the probability of forming a cluster with an initial mass between @xmath32 and @xmath33 at a time between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as @xmath36 . for a @xcite type cimf",
    "this then gives @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant that scales with the cluster formation rate ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 is the mass where the exponential drop occurs .",
    "note that we fix the power law index in the schechter cimf to @xmath0 .",
    "an equivalent distribution function for the present day masses ( @xmath41 ) of clusters , @xmath42 , can be found from multiplying equation  ( [ eq : dndmisch ] ) by @xmath43 which describes the relation between the initial and the present cluster mass to taken into account cluster dissolution .",
    "this was done by @xcite and @xcite to model the mass function of globular clusters using a constant mass loss rate . and",
    "@xcite apply a mass dependent mass loss rate to model age and mass distributions of cluster populations using a power law and a schechter cimf , respectively .",

    "the luminosity function ( lf ) is then found by integrating @xmath48 over all ages    @xmath49    the logarithmic slope at each @xmath44 , which is a probe of the shape of the lf , is found from @xmath50    an example of a model lf based on a schechter cimf and mass dependent dissolution is shown in the top panel of fig .
