    "the models with gauge symmetry @xmath5 also called 331 models , arise by enlarging the symmetry group where the standar model ( sm ) is embedded as an effective theory at low energy .",
    "based on the criterion of cancellation of chiral anomalies @xcite , these models have generated new expectations and possibilities of new physics at the tev scale whose predictions are sensitive to experimental observation and will be of great interest in the next generation of colliders ( lhc , ilc ) @xcite at the tev energy scales . among the most remarkable features of these models , we have that they arise as an interesting alternative to explain the origin of generations @xcite , they leads to the prediction of new neutral and charged vector bosons with observable consequences at low and high energies , and they can predict the charge quantization for a three family model even when neutrino masses are added @xcite .",
    "although cancellation of anomalies leads to some required conditions fourteen , such criterion alone still permits an infinite number of 331 models . in these models , the electric charge is defined in general as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the group    @xmath6    where the value of the @xmath7 parameter determines the fermion assignment and , more specifically , the electric charges of the exotic spectrum .",
    "hence , it is customary to use this quantum number to classify the different 331 models .",
    "there are two main versions of 331 models corresponding to @xmath8 @xcite which leads to non - exotic charges , and @xmath9 @xcite which accounts for doubly charged bilepton bosons .",

    "the group structure of these models leads , along with the sm neutral boson @xmath10 to the prediction of an additional current associated to the extra neutral boson @xmath11 it is possible to obtain constraints through direct production of the @xmath12 boson ( for center - of - mass energy @xmath13 ) , where the study of decay widths provide information about possible @xmath14detection in future experimental measurements .",
    "these decay widths are controlled by the @xmath15 coupling constants denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and which follows the relation    @xmath18    where @xmath19 with @xmath20 the weinberg angle .",
