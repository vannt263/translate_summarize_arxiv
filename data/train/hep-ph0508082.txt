    "in most of extensions of the sm , new massive and neutral gauge bosons , called @xmath7 , are predicted .",
    "the phenomenological features that arise about such boson has been subject of extensive study in the literature zprima , whose presence is sensitive to experimental observations at low and high energy , and will be of great interest in the next generation of colliders ( lhc ) @xcite . in particular , it is possible to study some phenomenological features associated to this extra neutral gauge boson through models with gauge symmetry @xmath8 also called 331 models .",
    "these models arise as an interesting alternative to explain the origin of generations @xcite , where the three families are required in order to cancel chiral anomalies completely @xcite .",
    "an additional motivation to study these kind of models comes from the fact that they can also predict the charge quantization for a three family model even when neutrino masses are added @xcite .",
    "although cancellation of anomalies leads to some required conditions fourteen , such criterion alone still permits an infinite number of 331 models . in these models , the electric charge is defined in general as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the group    @xmath9    as it has been studied in the literature @xcite , the value of the @xmath10 parameter determines the fermion assignment , and more specifically , the electric charges of the exotic spectrum .",
    "hence , it is customary to use this quantum number to classify the different 331 models .",
    "if we want to avoid exotic charges we are led to only two different models i.e. @xmath11 @xcite .",
