    "the usual test of whether a deterministic dynamical system is chaotic or nonchaotic is the calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath12 .",
    "a positive largest lyapunov exponent indicates chaos : if @xmath13 , then nearby trajectories separate exponentially and if @xmath14 , then nearby trajectories stay close to each other .",
    "this approach has been widely used for dynamical systems whose equations are known ( abarbanel _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; eckmann _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ; parker & chua 1989 ) .",
    "if the equations are not known or one wishes to examine experimental data , this approach is not directly applicable .",
    "however lyapunov exponents may be estimated ( wolf _ et al . _ 1985 ; sana & sawada 1985 ; eckmann _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ; abarbanel _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) by using the embedding theory of takens ( 1981 ) or by approximating the linearisation of the evolution operator .",
    "nevertheless , the computation of lyapunov exponents is greatly facilitated if the underlying equations are known and are low - dimensional .    in this article",
    ", we propose a new @xmath0@xmath1 test for chaos which does not rely on knowing the underlying equations , and for which the dimension of the equations is irrelevant .",
    "the input is the time series data and the output is either a @xmath0 or a  @xmath1 depending on whether the dynamics is nonchaotic or chaotic . since our method",
    "is applied directly to the time series data , the only difference in difficulty between analysing a system of partial differential equations or a low - dimensional system of ordinary differential equations is the effort required to generate sufficient data .",
    "( as with all approaches , our method is impracticable if there are extremely long transients or once the dimension of the attractor becomes too large . ) with experimental data , there is the additional effect of noise to be taken into consideration .",
    "we briefly discuss this important issue at at the end of this paper",
    ". however , our aim in this paper is to present our findings in the situation of noise - free deterministic data .",
    "to describe the new test for chaos , we concentrate on the continuous time case and denote a solution of the underlying system by @xmath4 .",
    "the discrete time case is handled analogously with the obvious modifications .",
    "consider an observable @xmath15 of the underlying dynamics .",
    "the method is essentially independent of the actual form of @xmath3  almost any choice of @xmath3 will suffice . for example if @xmath16 then @xmath17 is a possible and simple choice .",
    "choose @xmath6 arbitrarily and define @xmath18 ( throughout the examples in  [ sec : example ] and  [ sec : morex ] we fix @xmath19 once and for all . )",
    "we claim that    * @xmath8 is bounded if the underlying dynamics is nonchaotic and * @xmath8 behaves asymptotically like a brownian motion if the underlying dynamics is chaotic .",
    "the definition of @xmath20 in  , which involves only the observable @xmath21 , highlights the universality of the test .",
    "the origin and nature of the data which is fed into the system   is irrelevant for the test , and so is the dimension of the underlying dynamics .",
    "later on , we briefly explain the justification behind the claims ( i ) and ( ii ) . for the moment",
    ", we suppose that the claims are correct and show how to proceed .",
    "to characterise the growth of the function @xmath8 defined in  , it is natural to look at the mean square displacement ( msd ) of @xmath8 , defined to be @xmath22 if the behaviour of @xmath8 is brownian , i.e.  the underlying dynamics is chaotic , then @xmath23 grows linearly in time ; if the behaviour is bounded , i.e.  the underlying dynamics is nonchaotic , then @xmath23 is bounded .",
    "we define @xmath9 as the asymptotic growth rate of the msd .",
    "the growth rate @xmath24 can be numerically determined by means of linear regression of @xmath25 versus @xmath26 ( press _ et al .",
    "( to avoid negative logarithms we actually calculate @xmath27 which obviously does not change the slope @xmath24 . )",
    "this allows for a clear distinction of a nonchaotic and a chaotic system as @xmath24 may only take values @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "we have lost though the possibility of quantifying the chaos by the magnitude of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath12 .",
    "numerically one has to make sure that initial transients have died out so that the trajectories are on ( or close to ) the attractor at time zero , and that the integration time @xmath28 is long enough to ensure @xmath29 .",
    "we illustrate the @xmath0@xmath1 test for chaos with the help of a concrete example , the forced van der pol system , @xmath30 which has been widely studied in nonlinear dynamics ( van der pol 1927 ; guckenheimer & holmes 1990 ) . for fixed @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ", the dynamics may be chaotic or nonchaotic depending on the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "following parlitz & lauterborn ( 1987 ) , we take @xmath34 and let @xmath33 vary from @xmath35 to @xmath36 in increments of @xmath37",
    ". choose @xmath38 and @xmath19 .",
    "we stress that the results are independent of these choices for all practical purposes . as described below in  [ sec : just ] , almost all choices will work .",
    "( deliberately poor choices such as @xmath39 , or @xmath40 or @xmath41 obviously fail ; sensible choices that fail are virtually impossible to find . )    in figure  [ fig : skew ] we show a plot of @xmath24 versus @xmath33 .",
    "the periodic windows are clearly seen . as a comparison",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : lyap ] the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath12 versus @xmath33 . since the onset of chaos does not occur until after @xmath42 we display the results only for the range @xmath43 in figures  [ fig : skew ] and  [ fig : lyap ] .",
    "( both methods easily indicate regular dynamics for @xmath44 . )",
    "naturally we do not obtain the values @xmath10 and @xmath11 exactly  the mathematical results that underpin our method predict these values in the limit of infinite integration time .",
    "( the same caveat applies equally to the lyapunov exponent method . ) in producing the data for figures  [ fig : skew ] and  [ fig : lyap ] , we allowed for a transient of 200,000 units of time and then integrated up to time @xmath45 .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : cutoff ] , for most of the @xmath46 data points in the range of @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "next , we carry out the @xmath0@xmath1 test for the forced van der pol system in the situation of a more limited quantity of data .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : skew4 ] for @xmath49 .",
    "we again allow for a transient time 200,000 but then integrate only for @xmath50 .",
    "the transitions between chaotic dynamics and periodic windows are almost as clear with @xmath50 as they are with @xmath45 even though the convergence of @xmath24 to @xmath0 or @xmath1 is better with @xmath45 .",
    "to test the method on high - dimensional systems we investigated the driven and damped kortweg - de  vries ( kdv ) equation ( kawahara & toh 1988 ) @xmath51 on the interval @xmath52 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this partial differential equation has non - chaotic solutions if the dispersion @xmath53 is large and exhibits spatio - temporal chaos for sufficiently small @xmath53 .",
    "note that equation   reduces to the kdv equation when @xmath54 , and reduces to the kuramoto - sivashinksy equation when @xmath55 .",
    "we fix @xmath56 , @xmath57 and vary @xmath53 . for @xmath55",
    ", it is expected that the dynamics of the kuramoto - sivashinksy equation are chaotic for these parameter values . as an observable we used @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an arbitrarily fixed position , and we iterated until time @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 test confirms that the dynamics is chaotic at @xmath55 ( with @xmath61 ) .",
    "also , we obtain @xmath62 at @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath65 , indicating chaotic and regular dynamics respectively at these two parameter values .",
    "finally , for discrete dynamical systems , we tried out the test with an ecological model whose chaotic component is coupled with strong periodicity ( brahona & poon 1996 ; cazelles & ferriere 1992 ) .",
    "the model @xmath66 has a non - connected chaotic attractor consisting of seven connected components .",
    "our test yields @xmath67 with only @xmath68 data points and clearly shows that the dynamics is chaotic .",
    "the function @xmath8 can be viewed as a component of the solution to the skew product system @xmath69 driven by the dynamics of the observable @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 represent coordinates on the euclidean group @xmath72 of rotations @xmath73 and translations @xmath74 in the plane .",
    "we note that inspection of the dynamics of the @xmath74-trajectories of the group extension provides very quickly ( for small @xmath28 ) a simple visual test of whether the underlying dynamics is chaotic or nonchaotic as can be seen from figure  [ fig : dynam ] .",
    "( a )    ( b )    in nicol _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) it has been shown that typically the dynamics on the group extension is sublinear and furthermore that typically the dynamics is bounded if the underlying dynamics is nonchaotic and unbounded ( but sublinear ) if the underlying dynamics is chaotic .",
    "moreover , the @xmath20 and @xmath75 components each behave like a brownian motion on the line if the chaotic attractor is uniformly hyperbolic ( field _ et al .",
    "a nondegeneracy result of nicol _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) ensures that the variance of the brownian motion is nonzero for almost all choices of observable @xmath3 .",
    "recent work of melbourne & nicol ( 2002 ) indicates that these statements remain valid for large classes of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems , such as hnon - like attractors .",
    "there is a weaker condition on the ` chaoticity ' of @xmath76 that guarantees the desired growth rate @xmath11 for the mean square displacement  : namely that the autocorrelation function of @xmath77 decays at a rate that is better than quadratic .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath4 and @xmath78 denote solutions to the skew product equations   with initial conditions @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "if there are constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 for all @xmath84 , then @xmath11 as desired ( biktashev & holden 1998 ; ashwin _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; field _ et al .",
    "( again , results of nicol _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) ; field _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) ; and melbourne & nicol ( 2002 ) ensure that the appropriate nondegeneracy condition holds for almost all choices of @xmath3 . )",
    "there is a vast literature on proving decay of correlations ( baladi 1999 ) and this has been generalised to the equivariant setting for discrete time by field _",
    "( 2002 ) and melbourne & nicol ( 2002 ) and for continuous time by melbourne & trk ( 2002 ) .",
    "it follows from these references that @xmath11 , for large classes of chaotic dynamical systems .",
    "one might ask why it is not better to work , instead of the @xmath72-extension , with the simpler @xmath85-extension @xmath86 in principle , @xmath8 can again be used as a detector for chaos .",
    "however , by the ergodic theorem @xmath8 will typically grow linearly with rate equal to the space average of @xmath3 .",
    "this would lead to @xmath87 irrespective of whether the dynamics is regular or chaotic .",
    "hence , it is necessary to subtract off the linear term of @xmath8 in order to observe the bounded / diffusive growth that distinguishes between regular / chaotic dynamics .",
    "subtracting this linear term is a highly nontrivial numerical obstruction .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath73 variable in the definition   of @xmath8 and in the skew product   kills off the linear term .",
    "we have established a simple , inexpensive , and novel @xmath0@xmath1 test for chaos .",
    "the computational effort is of low cost , both in terms of programming efforts and in terms of actual computation time .",
    "the test is a binary test in the sense that it can only distinguish between nonchaotic and chaotic dynamics .",
    "this distinction is extremely clear by means of the diagnostic variable @xmath24 which has values either close to @xmath0 or close to @xmath1 .",
    "the most powerful aspect of our method is that it is independent of the nature of the vector field ( or data ) under consideration .",
    "in particular the equations of the underlying dynamical system do not need to be known , and there is no practical restriction on the dimension of the underlying vector field .",
    "in addition , our method applies to the observable @xmath70 rather than the full trajectory @xmath4 .",
    "related ideas ( though not with the aim to detect chaos ) have been used for pde s in the context of demonstrating hypermeander of spirals in excitable media ( biktashev & holden 1998 ) where the spiral tip appears to undergo a planar brownian motion ( see also ashwin _ et al .",
    "we note also the work of coullet & emilsson ( 1996 ) who studied the dynamics of ising walls on a line , where the motion is the superposition of a linear drift and brownian motion .",
    "( this is an example of an @xmath85-extension which we mentioned briefly in  [ sec : just ] . as we pointed out then",
    ", the linear drift is an obstruction to using an @xmath85-extension to detect chaos . )    from a purely computational point of view , the method presented here has a number of advantages over the conventional methods using lyapunov exponents . at a more technical level , we note that the computation of lyapunov exponents can be thought of abstractly as the study of the @xmath88-extension @xmath89 where @xmath88 is the space of @xmath90 matrices , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the size of the system .",
    "note that the extension involves @xmath93 additional equations and is defined using the linearisation of the dynamical system . to compute the dominant exponent , it is still necessary to add @xmath92 additional equations , again governed by the linearised system .",
    "in contrast , our method requires the addition of two equations .    in this paper , we have concentrated primarily on the idealised situation where there is an in principle unlimited amount of noise - free data .",
    "however , in ",
    "[ sec : example ] we also demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for limited data sets . an issue which will be pursued in further work is the effect of noise which is inevitably present in all experimental time series .",
    "preliminary results show that our test can cope with small amounts of noise without difficulty .",
    "a careful study of this capability , and comparison with other methods , is presently in progress .",
    "we are grateful to philip aston , charlie macaskill and trevor sweeting for helpful discussions and suggestions .",
