    "a useful probe of qcd would be to use appropriate observables in a jet to probe the polarization of the parton initiating the jet .",

    "as shown by collins , heppelmann and ladinsky@xcite , and by collins@xcite , the azimuthal dependence of hadrons around the jet axis is a measure of transverse polarization for quark jets .",
    "this effect we call the `` sheared jet effect '' .",

    "we show how the transverse - spin fragmentation function can be measured in unpolarized @xmath5 annihilation .",
    "perturbative qcd predicts that the quark and antiquark have quite well correlated transverse spins .",
    "hence a measurement of the azimuthal correlations of four particles , two from each of 2 jets , suffices to obtain the square of the desired fragmentation function(s ) .",

    "these sub - boxes represent schematically the four quadrants of the @xmath205 plane .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : frag ] that the particle of first rank of jet @xmath42 and the particle of first rank of jet @xmath47 make a non - exotic system .",
    "therefore sub - boxes where the _ two leading particles make a non - exotic system _ are favored ( @xmath174 ) compared to sub - boxes ( empty ) where these particles make an exotic system .",
    "the symbol @xmath175 means  favored \" but in a attenuated way , due to the necessity of creating extra @xmath206 pairs relative to other favored configurations in the same box .",

    "= 0.4 = 0.4    as with the previous flavor correlations , the existence of @xmath14-dependent favored configuration should be verified with disregard of the polarization effects .      in the `` string + @xmath208 '' model",
    "@xcite , the single - meson sheared jet asymmetry essentially depends on the rank of the meson : it is positive ( in our convention ) for odd ranks and negative for even ranks .",
    "furthermore , it decreases very fast when the rank increases .",
    "thus , for the 2-meson sheared jet asymmetry , the fragmentation coefficient @xmath209 is positive if @xmath156 has rank 1 , negative if @xmath157 has rank 1 .",
    "of course , ranks can not be determined experimentally , but they are correlated with ordering in @xmath14 , therefore this model predicts that @xmath209 has the same sign as @xmath210 .",
    "accordingly , the azimuthal correlation function @xmath211 should have the following size and sign :    * large positive in a upper right or lower left sub - box endowed with a @xmath174 * large negative in a upper left or lower right sub - box endowed with a @xmath174 * for an empty sub - box , @xmath211 should at first sight be small and with no obvious sign .",
    "and @xmath212 are not sharp boundaries between regions where the hadrons have particular ranks .",
    "] thus , in the @xmath213 quadrant corresponding to an empty sub - box , the sign of @xmath211 will be roughly determined by the nearest ",
    "nonempty \" quadrant .",
    "but the magnitude of @xmath209 will decrease fast  and its sign may change  when one goes far from the @xmath89 and @xmath212 lines .    note that if the sheared jet asymmetry depends on rank but with a sign opposite to the one predicted by the `` string + @xmath208 '' model , our conclusion about the sign of @xmath211 remains unchanged .",
    "another prediction , which is absolute , concerns the case where we choose @xmath214 .",
    "then @xmath215 are the antiparticles of @xmath216 @xmath217 .",
    "hence we get a definite sign for the correlation , since @xmath218 .",
    "furthermore having @xmath219 ensures that the correlation is not suppressed by the zero of @xmath220 at @xmath89 when 1 and 2 are identical particles .",
    "this case is flagged by the large bullets in table [ table : cc2 ] ( @xmath174 instead of @xmath174 ) .",
    "some constraints on the size of the sheared jet effect can be obtained from unpolarized deep - inelastic scattering , since measurements of the angular distributions probe the angular momentum of the hadron - pair .",
    "now , in a helicity basis relative to the jet axis , the azimuthal distributions we are discussing are sensitive to off - diagonal elements of this density matrix , and to those elements with unit helicity flip : @xmath221 .",
    "hence upper bounds on the off - diagonal elements can be obtained from the diagonal elements . some of the diagonal elements can be measured in unpolarized semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "suppose one measures the angular distribution of the pion pairs in their rest frame , as a function of the polar angle @xmath222 from the jet axis .",
    "this is a quantity that can in fact be measured in jets of any kind ( not only at lep , but in deep inelastic scattering , e.g. , emc and smc ) .",
    "the simplest case is when the pair comes from @xmath223 .",
    "then the general form of the distribution is @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are the fractions of the mesons that are produced in helicity 0 and helicity @xmath227 states .",
    "first observe that a deviation from this form would be indicative of interference effects .",
    "interference effects provide one mechanism to obtain a sheared jet effect @xcite .    more generally , recall that the helicity density matrix of a transversely polarized quark is a linear combination of a unit matrix and some off - diagonal terms which necessarily have @xmath221 .",
    "rotational invariance about the jet axis then implies that the density matrix for the di - hadron in the final state of a quark jet has the form of a diagonal matrix plus some @xmath221 terms .",
    "the diagonal part is identical to when the quark is unpolarized .",
    "diagonal terms with opposite helicity are equal    consider the case of the @xmath114 .",
    "positivity of the eigenvalues of the density matrix implies that a prerequisite for the off - diagonal helicity flip @xmath221 terms , is that the density matrix have terms of both helicity @xmath228 and @xmath227 .",
    "for example , suppose it happened that the angular distribution of the two pions were close to @xmath229 or to @xmath230",
    ". then the @xmath114 would be close to pure helicity @xmath228 or to @xmath227 ( respectively ) . in that case",
    "the sheared jet effect would be small .",
    "peak in the absence of @xmath114-continuum interference . ]    some data on this subject exist@xcite , but not of a sufficient precision .",
    "the existence of spin - dependence in fragmentation would provide a powerful tool for quark polarimetry , and would have a substantial impact on the utilization experiments on polarized high - energy scattering@xcite .",
    "such measurements are particularly important for transverse spin , where there is otherwise a paucity of twist-2 observables .",
