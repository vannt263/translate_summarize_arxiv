    "the search for higgs particles is one of important goals of the future high  energy colliders  @xcite .",
    "most interesting and crucial parameters are the values of the higgs couplings to other fundamental particles",
    ". a measurement of the couplings would allow us to make a choice between different higgs schemes .",
    "presumably , higgs boson may be revealed at the forthcoming lhc collider , but the precision will be insufficient for the aims outlined above .",
    "future muon colliders can provide a possibility to study the higgs properties in detail .",
    "the idea to collide @xmath3-lepton beams was discussed long ago  @xcite .",
    "its recent development and a discussion of physics goals are given , for example , in paper  @xcite .",
    "nowadays there are two designs for @xmath4 colliders : + 1 ) @xmath5 ; + 2 ) @xmath6 .",
    "a @xmath4 collider has definite advantages as compared to @xmath7 one : + 1 ) beamstrahlung and bremsstrahlung essentially absent ; + 2 ) @xmath8 ; + 3 ) focus problems absent , energy resolution @xmath9 , small diameter due to absence of synchrotron radiation ( cost decreases ) .    at the same time",
    "there are also disadvantages : the problem of cooling , expensive detectors , polarization implies significant loss in @xmath10 , only annihilation channel works @xmath11 hence @xmath12 .",
    "but apparently , the main positive feature of the @xmath13 collider is the possibility to study the @xmath14-channel higgs boson production ( _ higgs factory _ ) , because the cross  section of the latter is proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "when @xmath15 , it is better to study higgs boson production in association with the @xmath16-boson or photon  @xcite . in the latter case at the born level the cross ",
    "section for the process @xmath17 has , at high energies , the following form @xmath18 sharp dependence on photon energy @xmath19 in eq.(2 ) makes manifest a reason why the calculations of the radiative corrections ( rc ) to this process are urgently desirable , so we proceed with it . in paper",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the region @xmath20 the main contribution to the cross ",
    "section arises from 1loop electroweak corrections .",
    "the result of the first order rc to the differential cross  section of the process @xmath21 due to virtual ( fig .  1 ) and soft real photons in the case when photon is hitting a non  forward detector looks as follows : @xmath22 for hard ( with energy more than @xmath23 ) collinear photon emission we obtain @xmath24 \\times \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left [ \\frac{{{\\mbox{d}}}\\widetilde{\\sigma}_0(p_1(1-x),p_2)}{{{\\mbox{d}}}c } + \\frac{{{\\mbox{d}}}\\widetilde{\\sigma}_0(p_1,p_2(1-x))}{{{\\mbox{d}}}c}\\right]\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the so  called _ shifted _ ( or _ boosted _ ) cross  section . in general case ,",
    "when photon emission is allowed from both initial leptons , we have @xmath27}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see the cancellation of @xmath28 when integrate over @xmath29 from @xmath28 up to 1 .",
    "summing up the leading terms from eqs .",
    "( [ bsv],[hard ] ) , we get the first order leading logarithmic correction in the form @xmath30\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the _ plus operation _ acts as usually : @xmath31    our result may be compared with that obtained earlier  @xcite on rc to the fermionic width of higgs in the case @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , looking at the leading logarithms we see an agreement .",
    "the contribution of higher orders of perturbation theory can be taken into account in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "really , as opposite to the case of electron  positron annihilation into one virtual photon ( or @xmath33-boson )  @xcite we have to use here another kernel for evolution equations . considering only the non  singlet structure functions , we write down : @xmath34 a _ smoothed _ representation ( analogous to the one derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the modified d ",
    "function looks as follows : @xmath35    the master formula for radiatively corrected cross  section has the form of the drell  yan cross  section .",
    "so , we suggest to write the result as a convolution of the modified lepton structure functions with the shifted cross ",
    "section of the hard subprocess .",
    "it reads @xmath36 where a part of non  leading terms is taken into account by the @xmath37factor and @xmath38 is the experimental energy threshold of the photon registration .",
