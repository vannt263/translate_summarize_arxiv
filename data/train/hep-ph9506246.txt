    "several reasons persuade us to study supersymmetric ( susy ) grand - unified theories ( guts ) and their low - energy predictions .",
    "two motivations that i find very appealing are :    * gauge coupling unification : taking the values of the three gauge couplings at the weak scale and extrapolating ( using the rges ) to high energies , one finds that they meet at a scale @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "* the matter field multiplets , which under the standard model group look as in arbitrary representations , can be embedded in few multiplets of the gut @xcite .",
    "for example in su(5 ) , the matter fields ( of a given generation ) are embedded in the @xmath3 and * 10 * , and in so(10 ) they surprisingly fit in a single * 16*.    the above hints strengthen the hypothesis that ( @xmath4 ) there is a manifest gut at @xmath5 gev and ( @xmath6 ) the effective theory below @xmath7 is just the supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite ( desert hypothesis ) .",
    "the desert hypothesis acts as a microscope that magnifies by 14 orders of magnitude and allows us to look at planckean distances ; it allows us to translate theoretical ideas near the planck mass into low - energy predictions .",
    "there are many more parameters in addition to gauge couplings to be used as probes of susy guts : fermion and sparticle masses and mixing angles add up to a grand total of 110 physical parameters just in the supersymmetric flavour sector .",
    "according to the desert hypothesis , each of these parameters carries direct information about the structure of the theory at planckean distances .    here",
    "i will focus on the sparticle masses @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that the ; it was motivated from the need to suppress flavour - violating processes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , sparticles in different multiplets of the unified group have no symmetry reason to be degenerate at @xmath7 and even if they are assumed to be degenerate at the planck scale ( as in minimal supergravity theories ) their different interactions will split them by the time they reach the unification scale @xcite .",
    "these splittings are typically large due to the large size of the representations in unified groups @xcite .",
    "although this strong form of universality is not very realistic in guts , it is widely believed that a more restricted form is always valid : .",
    "this is considered a direct consequence of unification , which will be experimentally checked if sparticles are discovered at the lhc and nlc and their masses are known with some precision .",
    "i will show that , because the gut group is spontaneously broken , there is no good reason for this belief @xcite .",
    "sparticles , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which by virtue of their gauge and family quantum numbers can be grouped into an irreducible su(5 ) multiplet , do not necessarily originate from _ one _ such multiplet ; they could come about from a linear combination of several multiplets .",
    "this can produce non - degeneracy among sparticles of the same generation and complementary su(5 ) quantum numbers .",
    "i will show that these sparticle splittings occur precisely in theories ( and for the same reasons ) that produce interesting and desirable relations among fermion masses .",
    "the model @xcite is a minimal extension of the su(5 ) susy gut @xcite . consider an su(5 ) theory with just the third generation consisting of a @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the usual higgs fiveplet @xmath12 and antifiveplet @xmath13 , and the adjoint @xmath14 that breaks su(5 ) down to su(3)@xmath15su(2)@xmath15u(1 ) at the unification scale @xmath7 by acquiring a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) that points in the hypercharge direction : = v_24*y*v_24 diag ( 2,2,2,-3,-3 ) .",
    "[ vevsigma ] the bottom and tau masses are given by the superpotential w = h * 10*_1 |*5*_1 , and are equal at the unification scale @xcite .",
    "now add an extra fiveplet and antifiveplet denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the following couplings : w=*5*+h * 10*_1 |*5*_1 , [ superpotential ] where @xmath18 is near the unification mass .",
    "one linear combination of @xmath10 and @xmath17 will acquire a large mass of order @xmath19 .",
    "the orthogonal combination will be part of the low - energy spectrum .",
    "it contains the right - handed bottom quark and the tau lepton doublet which are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively ; because the hypercharges of @xmath20 and @xmath21 differ , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ vevsigma ] ) and ( [ superpotential ] ) that they will be _ different _ linear combinations of the corresponding states in @xmath10 and @xmath17 : ( ) = -_y |*5*_1 + _ y |*5*_2 , [ rotation ] where _",
    "y= , with @xmath22",
    ".    since @xmath10 and @xmath17 are in different representations of su(5 ) , they have , in general , different soft susy - breaking masses at @xmath7 @xcite : _ soft = m^2_1||*5*_1|^2+m^2_2||*5*_2|^2 .",
    "since the light combination is given by ( [ rotation ] ) , one has m^2_b_r&=&m^2_2",
    "+ s^2_b_r(m^2_1-m^2_2 ) , + m^2__l&=&m^2_2 + s^2__l(m^2_1-m^2_2 ) , [ splitst ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is given by s_a=_y_a= , and @xmath26 is the hypercharge of @xmath27 . therefore ,",
    "the squark and slepton masses differ at @xmath7 ; their fractional mass - splitting , for @xmath28 , is given by = , [ splits ] where @xmath29 .",
    "( [ splits ] ) is plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "one can see that a mass - splitting of @xmath30 can be obtained .",
    "the fermion masses arise from the yukawa coupling @xmath31 : m_b&=&hs_b_r , + m_&=&hs__l , which leads to the ratio between the bottom and tau mass = = .",
    "[ splitf ] this ratio tends to @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the small and large @xmath34 limit respectively . from eqs .",
    "( [ splits ] ) and ( [ splitf ] ) , one can see that the scalar mass - splitting is correlated to the fermion one .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 , where the dashed line represents the ratio @xmath35 . the maximum values for the scalar mass - splitting correspond to @xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "thus this model , although it is a minimal perturbation of the su(5 ) susy gut @xcite , easily accommodates values of @xmath35 that are between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as a consequence , the strong constraints on the top mass that arise from bottom ",
    "tau unification @xcite can be relaxed .",
    "it is now easy to see how the sparticle and particle splittings came about in this model .",
    "although the right - handed bottom and the tau lepton doublet  by virtue of their family and gauge quantum numbers  appear to belong to the same @xmath38 of su(5 ) ,",
    "they in fact , because of their different hypercharges , came from two _ different _ linear combinations of a pair of @xmath38s .",
    "this causes su(5)-breaking effects in sparticles and particles to be felt at the tree - level , since they occur at the very basic stage of defining the light states of the theory .",
    "the same idea can be implemented for the states in the decuplets , adding to the previous model an extra @xmath39 and @xmath40 . as shown in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , these splittings can be much larger than for the fiveplet since the differences in hypercharges are larger in the decuplet .",
    "the previous example can be easily adapted to so(10 ) ; the higgs are in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the matter fields are embedded in the @xmath44 spinor representations . here , however , i will consider a different scenario . instead of adding an extra @xmath45 and @xmath44 , i will add a @xmath46 , @xmath47 and a @xmath48 that gets a vev of @xmath49 : w=*10*+h * 16**10*_h * 16 * .",
    "[ superpotentialc ] as in the previous model , the light quarks and leptons arise from the linear combination , @xmath50 , where now the mixing angle is ( because only the su(5 ) singlet of @xmath48 gets a vev ) = [ sin ] where @xmath51 .",
    "notice that only @xmath20 and @xmath21 are a mixture of both multiplets , the @xmath46 and the @xmath44 , while the other particles come only from the @xmath44 .",
    "this is because under su(5 ) @xmath52 and it only contains states of gauge quantum numbers of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the scalar masses are split according to m^2_a = m^2_16+^2(m^2_10-m^2_16 ) , [ splitsb ] which preserve su(5 ) invariance because the @xmath53 does not break this subgroup of so(10 ) .",
    "the fermion masses in this model are proportional to @xmath54_a$ ] , the @xmath55 of the field @xmath27 . for the third family",
    ", one has = = , [ splitfb ] which for large values of @xmath34 ( @xmath56 ) leads to ~1 ; this accounts for the large mass difference @xmath57 without requiring a large ratio of the vevs of the higgs doublets .",
    "the same mechanism of mass - splitting can be applied for the higgs . in the minimal so(10 )",
    "model the two light - higgs doublets , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are embedded in the @xmath60 ; their soft masses are equal at @xmath7 and a severe fine - tuning is required to get the correct electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "let us introduce to the minimal model an extra @xmath48 and two @xmath61s ; one of them gets a vev of @xmath49 : w=+h * 16**10*_h * 16 * . in this model ,",
    "one obtains ( m^2_h_1-m^2_h_2)/m^2_h_2&=&^2(m^2_16-m^2_10)/m^2_10 , + h_t / h_b&=&1/ , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "since the @xmath64@xmath7 evolution @xcite leads to @xmath65 , one finds the following nice correlation at @xmath7 : h_t > h_bm^2_h_1>m^2_h_2 , , @xmath66 , which favours the electroweak breaking , is related with the fact that @xmath67 .",
