    "this note addresses some questions raised by p. hegarty in @xcite . in that paper",
    "he studied results about graphs inspired by the cauchy - davenport theorem .",
    "all graphs in this paper are simple and loopless . for two vertices @xmath2 , denote the length of the shortest path between them by @xmath3 . for @xmath4 , define its _ ith neighborhood _ as @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath1th power of a graph @xmath0 , denoted @xmath6 , is constructed from @xmath0 by adding an edge between two vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 when they are within distance @xmath1 in @xmath0 .",
    "define the diameter of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , as the minimal @xmath1 such that @xmath6 is complete ( alternatively , the maximal distance between two vertices ) .",
    "denote the number of edges of @xmath0 by @xmath10 . for @xmath4 and a set of vertices @xmath11 ,",
    "define @xmath12 .",
    "the cayley graph of a subset @xmath13 is constructed on the vertex set @xmath14 . for two distinct vertices",
    "@xmath15 , we define @xmath16 to be an edge whenever @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the following is a consequence of the cauchy - davenport theorem ( usually stated in the language of additive number theory @xcite ) .",
    "[ thm : cauchydavenport ] let @xmath19 be a prime , @xmath20 a subset of @xmath14 , and @xmath0 the cayley graph of @xmath20 .",
    "then for any integer @xmath21 : @xmath22    if we take @xmath20 to be the arithmetic progression @xmath23 , then equality holds in this theorem for all @xmath24 .",
    "we might look for analogues of theorem [ thm : cauchydavenport ] for more general graphs @xmath0 .",
    "in particular since these cayley graphs are always regular and ( when @xmath19 is prime ) connected , we might focus on regular , connected @xmath0 . in @xcite hegarty proved the following theorem :    [ thm : hegarty ] suppose @xmath0 is a regular , connected graph with @xmath25 .",
    "then we have @xmath26 with @xmath27    in other words , the cube of @xmath0 retains the original edges of @xmath0 and gains a positive proportion of new ones . in section 3",
    "we prove this theorem with an improved constant of @xmath28 .",
    "the requirement of regularity can not be easily dropped , as shown in @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm : hegarty ] leads to the question of how the growth behaves for other powers of the @xmath0 . note that theorem [ thm : hegarty ]",
    "can not be used recursively to obtain such a result  since the cube of a regular graph is not necessarily regular . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that no equivalent of theorem [ thm : hegarty ] exists with @xmath29 replaced by @xmath30 , and it was asked what happens for higher powers . in this note",
    "we address that question .",
    "we prove the following theorem :    [ thm : higherpowers ] suppose @xmath0 is a regular , connected graph , and @xmath31 .",
    "then we have : @xmath32    let the degree of each vertex be @xmath33 .",
    "fix some @xmath34 with @xmath35 nonempty .",
    "consider any vertex @xmath36 .",
    "then for any @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 , there is a @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "for such a @xmath41 , all vertices @xmath42 have @xmath43 .",
    "all such @xmath7 are contained in @xmath44 , hence @xmath45 note that each @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 . summing the bound ( [ eq : bound ] ) over all these @xmath37 , noting that any edge is counted at most once , we obtain @xmath48",
    "now we sum this over all @xmath49 .",
    "note that since the edges counted above go from some @xmath50 to @xmath51 with @xmath52 , each edge is counted at most once .",
    "also we havent yet counted any of the original edges of @xmath0 , so we might as well add them .",
    "hence @xmath53    obviously there was nothing particularly special about @xmath34 .",
    "we can get a similar expresssion using @xmath54 , namely @xmath55 averaging ( [ eq : vsum ] ) and ( [ eq : vsum2 ] ) we get    @xmath56    note that for any @xmath57 we have @xmath58 this is because @xmath59 . putting the bound ( [ eq : sumbound ] ) into the sum ( [ eq : vsumaverage ] ) we obtain @xmath60 thus the theorem is proven .",
    "note that for @xmath61 the bounds in theorem [ thm : higherpowers ] are trivial .",
    "in particular it says nothing about the increase in the number of edges of the cube of a regular , connected graph .",
    "such an increase was already demonstrated by hegarty in theorem [ thm : hegarty ] .",
    "here we give an alternative proof of that theorem , yielding a slightly better constant .",
    "[ thm : improvedhegarty ] suppose @xmath0 is a regular , connected graph with @xmath62",
    ". then we have @xmath63    let the degree of each vertex be @xmath33 .",
    "note that as @xmath0 is regular , and not complete , every @xmath4 will have a non - neighbour in @xmath0 .",
    "together with connectedness this implies that each @xmath4 has at least one new neighbour in @xmath30 .",
    "this implies the theorem for @xmath64 . for the remainder of the proof , we assume that @xmath65 .",
    "the proof rests on the following colouring of the edges of @xmath0 : for an edge @xmath66 in @xmath0 , colour @xmath67    notice that if @xmath66 is a blue edge , then there are at least @xmath68 neighbours of @xmath69 in @xmath30 .",
    "this is because @xmath69 will be connected to everything in @xmath70 except itself , and @xmath71 for @xmath66 blue . if , in addition , we have some @xmath7 connected to @xmath69 by an edge ( of any colour ) , then @xmath7 will be at distance at most @xmath72 from everything in @xmath73 . hence @xmath7 will have at least @xmath68 neighbours in @xmath29 .",
    "+ partition the vertices of @xmath0 as follows :    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76 + by the above argument , if @xmath34 is in @xmath77 , then @xmath78 . recall that each @xmath79 will have at least one new neighbour in @xmath30 , giving @xmath80 .",
    "summing these two bounds over all vertices in @xmath0 , noting that any edge is counted twice , gives @xmath81    recall that we are considering the case when @xmath65 .",
    "thus to prove that @xmath82 , it suffices to show that @xmath83 . to this end",
    "we shall demonstrate that @xmath84 .",
    "first however we need a proposition helping us to find blue edges in @xmath0 .",
    "[ cliqueproposition ] for any @xmath4 there is some @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    ". then there are vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that @xmath88 forms a path between @xmath69 and @xmath34 .",
    "we will show that one of the edges @xmath89 , @xmath16 or @xmath90 is blue .",
    "this will prove the proposition assuming that there are _ any _ blue edges to begin with .",
    "however , it also shows the existence of blue edges because @xmath25 .",
    "so , suppose that the edges @xmath89 and @xmath91 are red . then we have @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . using this and @xmath94 gives    @xmath95    therefore @xmath96 . hence @xmath16 is blue , proving the proposition",
    "now we will show that @xmath84 .",
    "suppose @xmath97 . by the definition of @xmath98 , there is a @xmath99 such that @xmath100 is an edge .",
    "this edge is neccesarily red as @xmath101 . using @xmath102,we have @xmath103 .",
    "hence @xmath104 .",
    "proposition [ cliqueproposition ] implies that there is some @xmath97 such that @xmath105 is an edge .",
    "since @xmath105 is red , we have @xmath106 . using this",
    ", the fact that @xmath107 , and ( [ eq : upperbound ] ) , gives @xmath108    double - counting the edges between @xmath11 and @xmath98 using the bounds ( [ eq : upperbound ] ) and ( [ eq : lowerbound ] ) gives a contradiction unless @xmath109 .",
    "therefore @xmath110 as required .",
    "theorem [ thm : higherpowers ] answers the question of giving a lower bound on the number of edges that are gained by taking higher powers of a graph .",
    "we obtain growth that is linear with @xmath1  just as in theorem [ thm : cauchydavenport ] .",
    "* the constant @xmath111 in theorem [ thm : higherpowers ] can not be improved to something of the form @xmath112 with @xmath113 . to see and consider the following sequence of graphs @xmath114",
    "as @xmath33 tends to infinity : + take disjoint sets of vertices @xmath115 , with @xmath116 if @xmath117 and @xmath118 otherwise .",
    "add all the edges within each set and also between neighboring ones .",
    "so if @xmath119 , @xmath120 , then @xmath66 is an edge whenever @xmath121 ( see figure [ fig : img1 ] ) .",
    "+ .,width=377 ] + the number of edges in @xmath114 is at least the number of edges in the larger classes which is @xmath122 .",
    "+ the @xmath1th power @xmath123 has less than @xmath124 edges which is less than @xmath125",
    ". therefore , @xmath126 + the graphs @xmath114 are not regular , but if @xmath127 , it is possible to remove a small ( less than @xmath128 ) number of edges from the graphs and make them @xmath33-regular without losing connectedness ( any cycle passing through all the vertices in @xmath129 would work ) . call these new graphs @xmath130 . by the same argument as before we have @xmath131 +",
    "if @xmath132 , a similar trick can be performed , but we d need to start with @xmath116 if @xmath133 and @xmath118 otherwise .",
    "+ so the factor of @xmath134 can not be improved for regular graphs .",
    "all these examples are inspired by one given in @xcite to show that for any @xmath135 there are regular graphs @xmath0 with @xmath136 .",
    "* despite the above example , there is certainly room for further improvement in theorems [ thm : higherpowers ] and [ thm : improvedhegarty ]",
    ". in particular , theorem [ thm : improvedhegarty ] does nt seem tight in any way .",
    "the graphs @xmath130 seem to give essentially the slowest possible growth for _ all _ powers of regular graphs . considering the graphs @xmath137 leads to the conjecture of @xmath138 for @xmath0 regular , connected , and @xmath25 . +",
    "a shortcoming of theorem [ thm : higherpowers ] is that it only gives a good bound if the diameter of @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 .",
    "when this is not the case , the number of edges in @xmath6 seems to grow faster . it would be interesting to obtain a good lower bound on @xmath139 involving both @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",
    "* all the questions from this paper and @xcite could be asked for directed graphs .",
    "in particular one can define directed cayley graphs for a set @xmath13 by letting @xmath16 be a directed edge whenever @xmath140 .",
    "then the cauchy - davenport theorem implies an identical version of theorem [ thm : cauchydavenport ] for directed cayley graphs . in this setting",
    "it is easy to show that there is growth even for the square of an out - regular oriented graph @xmath141 ( a directed graph where for a pair of vertices @xmath69 and @xmath34 , @xmath66 and @xmath142 are not both edges ) . in particular , we have @xmath143 this occurs because every vertex @xmath34 has @xmath144 in an out - regular oriented graph",
    ". it s easy to see that this is best possible for such graphs .",
    "one can construct out - regular oriented graphs with an arbitrarily large proportion of vertices @xmath34 satisfying @xmath145 .",
    "+ however if we insist on _ both _ in and out - degrees to be constant , ( 8) no longer seems tight .",
    "such graphs are always eulerian . in @xcite",
    "there is a conjecture attributed to jackson and seymour that if an oriented graph @xmath141 is eulerian , then @xmath146 holds .",
    "if this conjecture were proved , it would be an actual generalization of the directed version of theorem [ thm : cauchydavenport ] , as opposed to the mere analogues proved above .",
    "i would like to thank my supervisors jan van den heuvel , and jozef skokan for much helpful advice and remarks ."
