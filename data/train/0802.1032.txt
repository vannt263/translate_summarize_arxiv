    "present - day cosmological research hovers around the investigation of _ dark energy _ , an exotic type of entity responsible for generating acceleration in expanding universe . in fact , various recent observational results @xcite suggest that the universe is expanding with an acceleration alone while some other works @xcite indicate that the acceleration is a phenomenon of recent past and was preceded by a phase of deceleration .",
    "now , the exact nature of dark energy being still unknown , its investigation are going on along various paths .",
    "phenomenological models are also contenders in this dark energy investigation .",
    "although these type of phenomenological models do not originate from any underlying quantum field theory , yet they are useful enough to arrive at some fruitful conclusions . out of three main variants of phenomenological models , viz .",
    "kinematic , hydrodynamic and field - theoretic models @xcite , the present work deals with kinematical models where the dark energy representative @xmath0 is assumed to be a function of time .",
    "recently , ray et al.@xcite and mukhopadhyay et al.@xcite have shown the equivalence of four @xmath0 models , viz .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for spatially flat ( @xmath9 ) universe .",
    "but , since the closed ( @xmath10 ) and open ( @xmath11 ) universes can not be entirely ruled out , so there is enough reason to investigate dark energy for general @xmath12 . in this work , therefore , one of the equivalent @xmath0 models , viz .",
    "@xmath1 is selected to solve einstein equations for general @xmath12 in order to have a broader view of accelerating universe .",
    "the scheme of the investigation is as follows : sec .",
    "2 and 3 deals respectively with the field equations and their solutions while some physical feature arising out of this work are described in sec .",
    "finally , some conclusions are made in sec .",
    "the einstein field equations are given by @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cosmological term @xmath0 is time - dependent , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "let us choose the spherically symmetric flrw metric @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the curvature constant and @xmath16 is the scale factor .",
    "for the metric given by equation ( 2 ) , the field equations ( 1 ) yield friedmann and raychaudhuri equations respectively given by @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the velocity of light in vacuum , is assumed to be unity .",
    "the generalized energy conservation law , when both @xmath0 and @xmath20 vary , is derived by shapiro et al.@xcite using renormalization group theory as well as by vereschagin and yegorian@xcite using gurzadyan - xue formula@xcite . since in the present work @xmath20",
    "is assumed as a constant and @xmath0 is a variable , then the above mentioned generalized conservation law reduces to the particular form @xmath21 the barotropic equation of state relating pressure and density is given by @xmath22 where the barotropic index @xmath2 can assume the values @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for pressure - less dust , electromagnetic radiation , stiff fluid and vacuum fluid respectively .    from ( 1 ) , using equation ( 6 ) , we get , @xmath27 again , differentiating equation ( 3 ) and using equations ( 5 ) - ( 7 ) we obtain the differential equation @xmath28",
    "using the _ ansatz _ @xmath29 , we immediately get from equation ( 8) @xmath30\\frac{\\dot a}{2a}-(3\\omega+1)\\frac{k}{2a\\dot a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation after simplification reduces to the form @xmath31 = -\\frac{(3\\omega+1)k}{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",
    "let us now study the following case when @xmath33 . in this case equation",
    "( 10 ) reduces to @xmath34 = -\\frac{(3\\omega+1)k}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving equation ( 11 ) we get our solution set as @xmath35^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37 + 2k\\left[{c_0}^{\\prime}t+{c_1}^{\\prime}-\\frac{(3\\omega+1)}{2}kt^2\\right ] } { \\left[[{c_0}^{\\prime}t+{c_1}^{\\prime}-\\frac{(3\\omega+1)}{2}kt^2\\right]^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath38 ^ 2}{4[{c_0}^{\\prime}t+{c_1}^{\\prime}-\\frac{(3\\omega+1)}{2}kt^2]^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 being constants of integration .    if we impose the boundary condition @xmath43 when @xmath44 , then @xmath45 which implies @xmath46 . then the simplified solution set becomes @xmath47^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "this means that we are getting einstein s expanding universe without @xmath0 .",
    "the above solution set is obtained by assuming @xmath53 .",
    "now , @xmath53 means @xmath54 for @xmath9 we get from equations ( 16 ) , ( 17 ) , ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) respectively @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "these results were obtained by ray et al.@xcite for flat ( @xmath9 ) universe .",
    "again , from equation ( 20 ) we have @xmath59    since equation ( 19 ) suggests that for a repulsive @xmath0 we must have @xmath60 , then from equation ( 21 ) we find that either @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath61 we get a universe where contribution of electromagnetic radiation is negligible ( for radiation dominated universe , @xmath63 ) while @xmath62 signifies the presence of phantom energy . again , using equation ( 18 ) , the expression for cosmic matter energy density @xmath64 can be easily derived and is given by @xmath65}{[{c_0}^{\\prime}-(1 + 3\\omega)kt]^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    also , from the _ ansatz _",
    "@xmath29 we get @xmath66    then , using equations ( 21 ) - ( 23 ) we obtain @xmath67}{[{c_0}^{\\prime}-(1 + 3\\omega)kt]^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the flat universe ( @xmath9 ) , equation ( 24 ) reduces to the case of ray et al.@xcite .",
    "again , equation ( 24 ) shows that at time @xmath44 , the sum of @xmath64 and @xmath68 becomes independent of the curvature constant @xmath12 and takes a unit value whatever may be the value of @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath69 tends to infinity , from ( 24 ) we have @xmath70 from equation ( 25 ) we again observe that , @xmath71 is independent of @xmath12 . thus , both the early and late phases of the universe exhibit the same behaviour so far as the curvature dependency of the sum of @xmath64 and @xmath68 is concerned .",
    "it has already been shown that for physically valid @xmath51 , either @xmath61 or @xmath62 . in the former case , @xmath72 and hence by equation ( 25 ) @xmath73    but , for @xmath62 we have @xmath74 and hence equation ( 25 ) provides the following constraint @xmath75    the above two relations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) suggest that in distant future not only the sum total of matter and dark energy density will be independent of curvature of space but also they will be either less than ( for @xmath61 ) or greater than ( for @xmath62 ) unity which misfits with the present status of the sum of two type of energy densities dominating the present universe .",
    "this result is very important for visualizing the cosmic evolution in future .",
    "now , let us suppose that the universe is composed of a mixture of two types of fluids having barotropic indices @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( say ) .",
    "then , from equation ( 25 ) we get @xmath78 @xmath79    if @xmath80 be the average of @xmath81 and @xmath82 then @xmath83.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( 30 ) shows that when @xmath84 , then @xmath85 this means that like the early and present universe , for late universe also the sum of @xmath64 and @xmath68 will be unity only if the universe contains a mixture of two types of fluids rather than a single fluid . since",
    "@xmath84 and it has already been shown that either @xmath61 or @xmath62 , then let us suppose , @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , for large value of @xmath69 , when the universe is filled with a mixture of two types of fluids ( one of them being phantom - fluid ) and if the value of barotropic index of one fluid is @xmath89 and that of the other is @xmath90 , then the average value of the sum of @xmath64 and @xmath68 will be equal to one .",
    "let us now consider the expression for the deceleration parameter @xmath4 which is given by @xmath91 if the universe is composed of two fluids with equation of state parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then each of them will have some effect on the dynamics of the universe .",
    "so for calculating the value of the deceleration parameter @xmath4 , contributions coming from each component should be taken into account .",
    "if @xmath92 and @xmath93 be the values of two separate parts of @xmath4 coming from fluids having barotropic indices @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , then using equation ( 17 ) we get from equation ( 33 ) the following two expressions @xmath94 ^ 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath95 ^ 2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath96 be the effective value for @xmath4 , coming after considering the separate parts @xmath92 and @xmath93 , then @xmath97 ^ 2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( 35 ) shows that the sign of @xmath4 depends only on two quantities , viz . , the integration constant @xmath98 and the curvature constant @xmath12 .",
    "if for simplicity we assume @xmath41 to be positive then we get an accelerating or a decelerating universe according as @xmath99 or @xmath100 . this result can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the universe is made of two types of fluids having equation of state parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 , one of which is acting as a prohibitor and another as a supporter of cosmic acceleration . in the previous matter",
    "dominated phase , @xmath12 had a small positive value ( i.e. @xmath101 ) and as a result the universe was decelerating .",
    "but at a certain time during cosmic evolution , the second type of fluid ( viz .",
    ", phantom fluid ) took the upper - hand ( i.e. @xmath102 ) and consequently @xmath12 has become slightly negative .",
    "that is why the present universe is in a state of acceleration .",
    "a very small positive or negative value of the curvature constant do not contradict the observational result that the present universe is nearly flat .",
    "further , the change of sign of @xmath4 shows that the cosmic acceleration is a recent phenomenon .",
    "the present work , apart from being a generalization of an earlier one@xcite , has revealed some new and interesting physical features also . for a flat universe",
    ", all the results of ray et al.@xcite can be recovered from the expressions of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 of the present work .",
    "moreover , it has been possible to trace the entire cosmic evolution , starting from the big - bang and extending to distant future .",
    "the most significant result is related to the cosmic matter and dark energy densities for non - flat universe .",
    "it has been shown that for non - flat universe , @xmath107 only when the universe is composed of two types of fluids , one with @xmath61 and another with @xmath62 .",
    "this means that both stiff - fluid ( @xmath108 ) and phantom - fluid ( @xmath109 ) can be one of the two constituents of the universe when the universe is not flat .",
    "the evolution of the deceleration parameter @xmath4 shows that a non - flat universe would be decelerating in the past and accelerating at present .",
    "this result is very significant for @xmath0-cdm cosmology .",
    "another interesting point is the absence of big - reap even in the presence of a fluid with @xmath62 .",
    "caldwell@xcite and caldwell et al.@xcite demonstrated the occurrence of a big - reap in the presence of a fluid with supernegative equation of state .",
    "it may be mentioned here that gonzalez - diaz @xcite has shown that by a proper generalization of the chaplygin - gas model , a big - reap can be avoided even in the presence of phantom energy whereas abdalla et al.@xcite have arrived at the same result through a slight modification of gtr .",
    "but in the present work , a cosmic doomsday is shown to be impossible within the normal framework of gtr .",
    "one of the reasons of it may be the presence of another fluid apart from the phantom fluid .",
    "that other fluid may act as an inhibitor of big - reap .",
    "it may be mentioned that stefanci @xcite has developed a model in which the dark energy component and the matter component interact with each other resulting in the appearance of phantom energy out of non - phantom matter .",
    "the present work can be considered as a counter example of that because here phantom matter , in the presence of another component as a mediator , can behave as a non - phantom matter .",
    "finally , it is to be noted that the present work has demonstrated that although current observational data points towards a @xmath9 universe , yet we are not in a position right now to completely rule out @xmath110 cosmologies .",
    "one of the authors ( sr ) would like to express his gratitude to the authorities of iucaa , pune , india for providing him the associateship programme under which a part of this work was carried out .",
