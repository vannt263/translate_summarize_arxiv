    "in order to realize quantum information processors , various kinds of physical systems have been proposed and investigated . in particular , solid - state devices with the quantum bits ( qubits ) realized by the spins of electrons confined in quantum dots in semiconductors",
    "@xcite are supposed to be promising in terms of its compatibility with existing semiconductor technology . among them , vertically stacked self - assembled inas quantum dots have an advantage of operational ability at relatively higher temperature of the order of 1 k because of the strong confinement of electrons.@xcite recall that an electron gas confined in two dimensions by schottky electrode operates at most at millikelvin order@xcite .",
    "furthermore the vertically stacked quantum dot system has higher scalability than the two dimensional electron gas system .",
    "we have proposed and investigated,@xcite from both experimental and theoretical aspects , a system of vertically stacked self - assembled inas dots buried in alinas barrier layer adjacent to the channel of a spin field - effect transistor ( fet ) .    in the proposed setup",
    "@xcite illustrated in fig.[device ] , each qubit evolves under the interactions with the neighboring qubits and would be rotated via electric spin resonance ( esr ) . moreover , it is possible to measure repeatedly the spin state of the electron in the edge quantum dot , just above the channel of the fet , by making use of the so - called spin - blockade measurement .",
    "although we can not directly access to the other qubits than the one on the edge for the proposed system , we can still perform useful operations on all the qubits .",
    "initialization and entanglement generation of multiple qubits can be realized via repeated measurements only on the edge qubit.@xcite the state tomography of qubits was discussed in ref .. in this paper , we show that a controlled - not ( cnot ) operation and a characterization of the operation by a quantum process tomography @xcite are also available in this system .",
    "a cnot gate is one of the most important gate operations because it constitutes a universal set of quantum gates together with singe - qubit rotations .",
    "the cnot gate operation has been carried out for several physical systems including linear optics,@xcite trapped atoms,@xcite and solid - state qubits.@xcite in ref . , it has been shown that the cnot gate operation can be implemented by using single - qubit rotations and neighboring spin exchange interaction .",
    "we investigate whether the scheme in ref .",
    "can be applied to the proposed system with experimentally reasonable parameters . furthermore in order to check that the quantum device operates correctly , it is required to characterize the gate operation . in this paper",
    ", we characterize the cnot gate operation for the proposed system by a quantum process tomography ( qpt ) with fluctuations of the operation time and incompleteness of the spin polarization of channel electrons taken into account .",
    "several qpt experiments have been demonstrated in nmr implementations,@xcite optical systems,@xcite and in solid - state qubits.@xcite notice that we are allowed to measure only the edge qubit of the chain of the qubits .",
    "still , we wish to carry out the complete qpt , and we are going to show that it is actually possible.@xcite    this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ structure ] , we describe the system of vertically stacked self - assembled inas quantum dots buried in alinas barrier layer adjacent to the channel of a spin fet and some characteristic properties of this system . in sec .",
    "[ sec - cnot ] , we introduce a scheme to realize the cnot operation and discuss a possibility of implementing this scheme to the proposed system with reasonable parameters . the quantum process tomography of the cnot gate is conducted on the basis of the state tomography scheme @xcite in sec .",
    "[ qpt ] . conclusion and future direction are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the proposed device is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ device ] .",
    "a series of self - assembled quantum dots are embedded in the fet structure just above the spin channel .",
    "a single electron is confined in each quantum dot and quantum information is encoded on its spin states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "such a situation where only a single electron is stored in each dot is realized by properly adjusting the gate voltage @xmath2 .",
    "each qubit can be rotated via esr to perform single - qubit operations , and the qubits are made entangled by the interactions between the adjacent qubits .",
    "the fet structure enables us to measure the spin state of the electron confined in the edge quantum dot @xmath3 .",
    "if the channel electrons are all in a definite spin state , say @xmath0 , the channel current @xmath4 exhibits either peaks or a monotonous increase as a function of the gate voltage @xmath2 , depending on the spin state of the electron in dot @xmath3 .",
    "when the spin state of @xmath3 is @xmath5 , a channel electron enters the edge dot @xmath3 at a certain gate voltage @xmath2 by the tunneling effect . on the contrary , when the spin state of @xmath3 is @xmath6 , it can not enter the dot due to pauli s exclusion principle ( spin blockade ) . thus one can measure the spin state of the edge qubit by sweeping the gate voltage @xmath2 and exploring the channel current @xmath4 .",
    "the feasibility of the present scheme is discussed in ref . ,",
    "in which the exchange interaction energy @xmath7 between adjacent qubits and the corresponding time scale @xmath8 are evaluated .",
    "esr absorption peak separations for quantum dots with a slightly modified compound ratio @xmath9 of the @xmath10 , which is necessary to a selective access to each qubit , are also investigated . for a selective spin flipping in stacked quantum dots , difference of more than 10% in the composition ratio of adjacent dots",
    "is needed .",
    "the spin - flipping time is estimated to be 50 ps .",
    "the modulation of the channel current by a single - electron charging in a quantum dot adjacent to the channel is demonstrated in a trial structure with a single layer of quantum dot with unpolarized channel current .",
    "a spin decoherence time of a few ns has been reported for inas self - assembled quantum dots.@xcite the electrical injection of spin - polarized electrons into semiconductors is investigated and demonstrated recently @xcite and the spin injection from ferromagnetic metals is demonstrated for several systems.@xcite in the case of heusler alloys as a spin injector , a spin - injection efficiency of at least 50% is already achieved.@xcite the spin injection with the high efficiency of 80% is also realized in the diluted magnetic semiconductor device.@xcite since hole conduction is used in the case of diluted magnetic semiconductor , the whole device must be changed into a hole system but it is expected that such efficient spin injection should be attained in the proposed system .",
    "in this study , we consider a two - qubit system , i.e. , only qubits x and a are considered . the cnot gate is represented by the following unitary transformation @xmath11 here qubit @xmath3 and @xmath12 are the control and target qubit , respectively and @xmath13 is the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath14 of @xmath15 .",
    "a general prescription to construct this operation by using of spin - spin exchange interaction @xmath16 and single - qubit rotations is proposed by hill.@xcite it is however not obvious whether this method is realizable in each physical system or not . therefore it is important to investigate the feasibility of a cnot gate in the proposed system .",
    "the prescription proposed by hill @xcite is as follows .",
    "firstly , we perform the so - called term isolation",
    ". the isolation of @xmath17 term can be achieved by the following sequence , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a single - qubit rotation of an angle @xmath20 around the @xmath21 axis of qubit @xmath22 ( @xmath23 or @xmath12 ) and an overall phase is ignored",
    ". then we can realize ( [ eq : cnot ] ) by using the isolated @xmath24 interaction ( [ term - iso ] ) and some single - qubit operations , @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the hadamard gate on qubit @xmath12 .    in the proposed device ,",
    "the strength of the exchange interaction @xmath27 is typically of the order of 0.01 - 1 mev for stacked self - assembled quantum dots and so the typical operation time @xmath28 becomes 0.5 - 50 ps .",
    "this is small enough compared to the spin - decoherence time of self - assembled quantum dots ( @xmath29 a few ns ) and comparable to the operation time of single - qubit spin rotation , implying that the cnot gate operation can be realized for the proposed system within the coherence time .",
    "to characterize the cnot gate operation , we perform the quantum process tomography ( qpt ) .",
    "the idea of qpt is to determine a completely positive ( cp ) map , which represents the process acting on an arbitrary input state @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are kraus operators and satisfy the condition @xmath33 .",
    "if we expand @xmath32 in terms of a basis for operators acting on @xmath30 , @xmath34 , the cp map @xmath35 can be rewritten as @xmath36 where @xmath37{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}[e_{nl}^\\dagger a_i]^*$ ] .",
    "the matrix @xmath38 is called a process matrix .",
    "if all elements of @xmath39 are known , one can obtain output state of cp map ( [ cp ] ) for any input state .",
    "when we choose the basis operators @xmath40 in terms of the basis vectors @xmath41 in hilbert space , @xmath42 is represented by @xmath43={\\langle}m|\\big\\{\\mathcal{e}(|k{\\rangle}{\\langle}l|)\\big\\}|n{\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "we can determine the process matrix elements as the output matrix elements of the cp map for the specific 16 inputs @xmath44 .    in order to obtain these process matrix elements @xmath42 we perform the following three steps of operation .",
    "step 1 : preparation of initial states . in this paper",
    ", we choose the following bases of hilbert space latexmath:[\\ ] ] other elements @xmath98 can be obtained in similar ways with appropriate initial states and sequences of operations .",
    "+      when we choose the bases as @xmath99 @xmath100 , the process matrix @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 where    @xmath103",
    "@xmath104    @xmath105    with @xmath106    figures [ mat_cnot ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) show the elements of the process matrix in the case of @xmath94 , for @xmath93 ( ideal case ) , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "since the effect of fluctuation of operation time @xmath109 is found to be small , @xmath110 case is not shown here .",
    "in fact the effect of the fluctuation of operation time appears through @xmath85 and the value of @xmath111 is at most 0.1 , which is corresponding to the case of @xmath112 % , then the deviation of @xmath113 from the ideal value 1 is at most a few percent . on the contrary ,",
    "most of the matrix elements contain terms that are degraded due to the imperfection of spin polarization in proportion to the polarization @xmath74 .    .",
    "solid line stands for @xmath94 case , while dashed line for @xmath114 case . ]",
    "next we estimate the fidelity of the process relative to the ideal case .",
    "the process fidelity is defined by @xmath115 $ ] where @xmath116 is the input - output matrix for the ideal cnot gate operation .",
    "we easily find @xmath117 .",
    "figure [ fidelity_cnot ] shows the process fidelity as a function of polarization @xmath74 .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath94 and @xmath114 cases , respectively . from this figure",
    ", we can see that a loss of process fidelity due to the fluctuation of operation time becomes larger as the polarization @xmath74 becomes larger . at the perfect polarization @xmath93 ,",
    "the loss of fidelity is about 5% for @xmath114 .",
    "notice that in the case of @xmath94 , the process fidelity is simply described as @xmath118 .",
    "when the polarization of channel electrons is @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , we obtain the process fidelity @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) for @xmath94 .    moreover , we investigated the spin polarization @xmath74 required to the confirmation of entanglement creation by cnot gate and process tomography . when the input state is a separable state @xmath123 and fluctuation @xmath94 , we have found that the output state is measured as an entangled state for the spin polarization of the electron @xmath124 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the realization of the cnot gate and characterized the gate operation by quantum process tomography for a two - qubit system , realized by electrons confined in self - assembled quantum dots embedded in the spin field - effect transistor . in this system , there exist the spin exchange interactions between the neighboring qubits and one can only measure the spin state of the edge qubit by the spin - blockade measurement .",
    "we have shown that the cnot gate operation can be realized by using the spin exchange interaction and several single - qubit rotations within the coherence time of qubits .",
    "the quantum process tomography can be also achieved in this system .",
    "we have taken into account of the fluctuation of operation time @xmath109 and the imperfection of polarization @xmath74 of channel electrons as sources of decay of fidelity .",
    "the process fidelity of cnot decreases at most 5% by the fluctuation of the operation time and the values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 are obtained for the channel spin polarizations of @xmath119 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "furthermore we have estimated the spin polarization required to the confirmation of entanglement creation by cnot gate and process tomography .",
    "we have found that @xmath127 .",
    "this will serve as a target value of the necessary polarization in order to experimentally implement the proposed device .",
    "in the recent experiments , spin - injection efficiency of 50% has already been achieved @xcite and experimental technology has been intensively advancing .",
    "therefore the cnot gate operation and process tomography for the proposed system should be able to be achieved experimentally .",
