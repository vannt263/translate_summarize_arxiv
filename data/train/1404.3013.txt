    "sec vii is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the rs model can resolve the gauge hierarchy problem by one @xmath5 extra dimension since this model replaces the gauge hierarchy by an exponential function of the fifth dimensional curvature @xmath2 times the size of the fifth dimension @xmath6 which is called the warp factor @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the background metric of the original rs model is given by @xmath8 the fifth dimension has the topology @xmath9 and is parametrized by @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the boundaries @xmath12 are locations of the four dimensional hidden ( @xmath13 ) and visible ( @xmath14 ) branes .",
    "the four dimensional effective action is obtained by integrating out the extra dimension .",
    "the fundamental mass parameter in the visible brane is reduced from the planck scale @xmath15 by the warp factor after canonical normalization of the kinetic term .",
    "the electroweak scale is obtained for @xmath16 , when @xmath17 tev .",
    "the value of @xmath3 , which is the size of the extra dimension is not determined if the distance between the visible and hidden branes is not stabilized .",
    "a mechanism for stabilizing the size of the extra dimension called goldberger - wise mechanism is proposed in  @xcite . in this mechanism , a massive five - dimensional scalar field with self - interaction terms at the two branes",
    "generates a potential for the radion in the effective theory .",
    "the radion corresponds to a fluctuation of the fifth dimension size .",
    "an appropriate value @xmath3 to realize the tev scale at the visible brane may be achieved without large fine tuning among the parameters of the scalar potential when the radion mass can also be below 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "the five dimensional metric may be expanded by a radion field @xmath18 as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is determined by the einstein equation . in the limit that the back - reaction can be ignored , @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the vacuum expectation value of the radion @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath24 is almost the same as the lightest kk particle mass .",

    "the radion couples to the trace of the sm energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the interactions of the radion with the sm fermions and the massive gauge bosons are similar to that of the higgs boson , but these are suppressed by @xmath26 tev instead of the higgs boson vacuum expectation value @xmath27 gev . however , quantum corrections generate the effective radion coupling to gluons and photons , which are known as the trace anomaly terms @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "next we consider the bulk matter fermions in the rs model . in this model",

    "the four dimensional yukawa couplings are determined by overlapping between the fifth dimensional wavefunction and the higgs boson at the visible brane .",
    "the large hierarchy among the sm yukawa couplings can be derived without fine tuning among @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "namely , we can take model parameters where the fifth dimensional wavefunctions of the third generation fermions are localized near the visible brane and those of the first and second generations are localized near the hidden brane . since the overlap between the fifth dimensional wavefunction of the third generation fermions and the higgs boson is large , the effective yukawa coupling of the third generation fermions are also large .",
    "conversely , in the case of the first and second generations , the four dimensional yukawa couplings are small due to the suppressed wavefunction at the visible brane , even though the five dimensional yukawa couplings can be large .",
    "when the sm fermions and gauge bosons propagate in the fifth dimension , kk modes of each field contribute to the higgs(radion)-@xmath32 and -@xmath33 couplings through triangle loop diagrams .",

    "<S> it is difficult to directly discover the heavy kaluza - klein(kk ) particles at the large hadron collider(lhc ) , because the mass of the lightest kk particle is expected to be above 10 tev to satisfy constraints from flavor changing neutral currents(fcnc ) . instead , the precision measurements of the higgs sector at the high luminosity lhc(hl - lhc ) and the international linear collider(ilc ) is a promising way to observe the deviation originating from the higgs - radion mixing and radiative corrections from the kk gauge bosons and matter fermions . </S>",
    "<S> for some cases , those effects are separately determined , providing valuable information on the model . </S>",
    "<S> we perform an extensive scan of the model parameters to see the expected deviations of the higgs couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we also choose several reference points consistent with the current data to show the precision of the fundamental parameter measurements at the future colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the radion-@xmath0-@xmath0 coupling in the model and discuss the role of the ilc for radion search .    </S>",
