    "it is well - known that matter falling into a black hole , or orbiting around it , is a source of gravitational radiation .",
    "the detection of these waves , and of the imprint they carry on the excitation of the black hole quasi normal modes ( qnm ) , would provide an invaluable test of general relativity in the strong - field regime .",
    "this process can be studied using the theory of black hole perturbations , the origin of which dates back to 1957 when regge and wheeler  @xcite showed that the axial perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole can be studied by solving a radial equation in the frequency domain , the angular part of the perturbation being known in terms of a suitable expansion in tensor spherical harmonics .    among the many dedicated to this subject",
    ", two papers can be considered as milestones in the theory of black hole perturbations .",
    "the first one is by f. zerilli  @xcite , who derived the radial equation governing the polar perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole , thus completing the work of regge and wheeler ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the second one is by s. teukolsky  @xcite , who achieved the formidable task of reducing the equations for the perturbations of a kerr black hole to a master radial equation .",
    "both the zerilli and the teukolsky equations were derived in the frequency domain .",
    "the theory of black hole perturbations has been developed largely to study the stability properties of black holes and to determine the gravitational signals emitted by point particles moving near black holes on different orbits ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , it has been used to evaluate back - reaction effects on the orbital motion of a point particle moving around a nonrotating black hole  @xcite .",
    "although it clearly represents only a toy - model , the point - particle approximation has been very useful to study a number of phenomena that occur in the neighborhood of black holes and it has also been applied to study stellar perturbations  @xcite .",
    "however , if one wants to investigate realistic astrophysical processes , in which finite - size effects and internal dynamics need to be properly taken into account , the point - particle approximation is certainly too crude .",
    "therefore , several attempts have been made towards a more realistic description . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , the point particle orbiting a black hole was treated as having a spin angular momentum , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the infalling matter was assumed to be a finite size sphere of dust .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite a semianalytic method was developed to study the radial infall of a shell of dust ; while this latter approach has the advantage of being easily generalizable to sources with arbitrary shapes , it has the serious drawback that it can be applied only to sources in which the matter configurations are freely falling onto the black hole .",
    "it is worth stressing that in all cases mentioned above the black hole is assumed to be nonrotating .",
    "alternative and more general approaches to treat extended sources have recently been developed by papadopulous and font  @xcite and by nagar et al .",
    "@xcite , by combining perturbative approaches with fully multidimensional hydrodynamical calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , the polar perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole induced by an oscillating , thick accretion disk ( a torus ) have been studied by solving the inhomogenous zerilli equation in the _",
    "time domain_. the source terms were computed self - consistently by using the results of two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations in which the relativistic hydrodynamical equations were solved for a torus oscillating in the schwarzschild , unperturbed background .",
    "the purpose of that work was to compare the gravitational signal found by solving the zerilli equation , with the one found using the standard quadrupole formalism applied to the oscillating torus .    in this paper",
    "we develop a new approach to study the perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole excited by extended matter sources , by solving the inhomogeneous bardeen - press - teukolsky ( bpt ) equation  @xcite in the _ frequency domain_. also in this case the source for the perturbative equations is the result of independent 2d hydrodynamical simulations in the time domain . because of the combined use of both time and frequency domains approaches , we refer to this as to a _ hybrid approach_.    there are at least three good reasons why our hybrid approach may be preferrable over a pure time - domain approach as the one used in  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the regge - wheeler and the zerilli equations ( hereafter rwz equations ) can not be generalized to rotating black holes , whereas the bpt equation admits such a generalization , _",
    "i.e. , _ the teukolsky equation ( we recall that the teukolsky equation is not separable in the time domain because the eigenvalues of the angular functions are frequency dependent ; this is not the case in the frequency domain where the equation is indeed separable . ) .",
    "secondly , although the bpt equation is intrinsically unstable when integrated in the time domain , its integration does not offer any numerical difficulty when performed in the frequency domain .",
    "thirdly , it is a common experience that by removing the error in the time integration of a system oscillating around its equilibrium state , a frequency - domain approach improves the overall accuracy .",
    "the work presented here serves therefore to develop a new procedure for the solution of the bpt equation with extended matter sources , whose generalization will allow to reach a long - standing goal : _",
    "i.e. , _ the study of the gravitational - wave emission from an extended source perturbing a _ rotating _ black hole .",
    "while the mathematical apparatus behind our hybrid approach is well - know , our numerical implementation is more innovative and to test it against an astrophysically realistic and computationally complex configuration we have here also considered the gravitational - wave emission from a high - density torus oscillating in its orbital motion around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this is the same source considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and thus offers the possibility of comparing for the same test case our hybrid approach with one which is instead in the time - domain only .    to this scope",
    ", we recall that the possibility that extremely dense and massive accretion tori form around a black hole has been considered in recent years , initially as a possible explanation of @xmath0-ray bursts  @xcite . in these systems , a torus of mass @xmath1 and mean density as high as @xmath2 g/@xmath3 , forms around a black hole of a few solar masses .",
    "the torus can be located within a few tens of km from the horizon and could also be subject to a dynamical instability which would induce its accretion onto the black hole on a dynamical timescale ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "high - density tori could be generated in many astrophysical scenarios ( see  @xcite for a general overview ) : in the coalescence of black hole - neutron star or neutron star binaries , as shown by several numerical simulations  @xcite in the collapse to a black hole of a rapidly rotating supramassive neutron star  @xcite , as a byproduct of collapsars , that is , massive stars in which iron core - collapse does not produce an explosion , but forms a black hole  @xcite . as discussed in  @xcite , these systems can be created with event rates comparable to that of core collapse supernovae . in addition , because the tori have an intrinsically large quadrupole moment , even small - amplitude oscillations would produce gravitational signals that may be detectable by ground based interferometers virgo and ligo  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the calculation of the gravitational waves from these tori does not only represent a useful testbed for our novel approach , but it also offers the opportunity for a more accurate calculation of the emission from a realistic and intense source of gravitational radiation .    the gravitational radiation emitted by a torus oscillating around a black hole was first computed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the newtonian quadrupole formalism",
    ". however , the quadrupole formalism may not be able to describe a system with such a high energy density , and located so close to a black hole horizon with sufficient accuracy .",
    "in particular , the possible excitation of the black hole qnm can not be revealed by the quadrupole approach .",
    "the same system has been studied in  @xcite , where the perturbed equations have been integrated in the time domain and no excitation of the black hole quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) was found .",
    "conversely , as we will later discuss , our hybrid method applied to the same system allows to catch the excitation of the black hole quasi normal modes , though the peak they produce in the energy spectrum is much smaller than that corresponding to the torus oscillation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ approach ] we review the main equations which describe the perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole in the rwz and in the bpt approaches when these are expressed in the frequency domain .",
    "furthermore , we also recall the expression of the gravitational energy flux computed within the newtonian quadrupole formalism . in section  [ hybr ]",
    "we present the analytical and numerical setup of our approach for the solution of both the perturbative and general relativistic hydrodynamics equations .",
    "finally , in section  [ results ] we discuss the results of the numerical integrations for the representative case of an oscillating torus , while in section  [ conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "a number of appendices contain details on the form of the source functions employed for the solution of the perturbative equations .",
    "in what follows we briefly summarize the relevant equations needed to describe the perturbations of a schwarzschild spacetime in the rwz and in the bpt formulations , as they will later be used in our hybrid approach .",
    "we will also write the expression of the energy flux computed within the newtonian quadrupole approximation since it will be used for comparison with the corresponding quantities computed within the perturbative approaches .      in the rwz approach  @xcite ,",
    "the equations describing the radial behaviour of the perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole are reduced to two wave equations after expanding all perturbed tensors in tensorial spherical harmonics and after separating the radial from the angular part . in particular , they are expressed for two suitable combinations of the components of the perturbed metric tensor and which are referred to as the zerilli function , @xmath4 , and the regge - wheeler function , @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "hereafter we will indicate with a `` tilde '' all the perturbative variables that have a time dependence which is not explicitly indicated and with @xmath6 the indices of the spherical harmonic decomposition .    since the system we will consider ,",
    "namely the oscillating torus perturbing the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime , is axially symmetric , the perturbations are also axially symmetric , and hence in what follows we will consider @xmath7 , with the zerilli and regge - wheeler functions expressed as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",

    "firstly , at low frequencies the spectra derived through the perturbative approach shows a rather good agreement with the quadrupole spectrum given in fig .",
    "this confirms what already noted in  @xcite and that , at least for this type of sources , the quadrupole approach captures the most important qualitative features of the energy spectrum .",
    "secondly , the spectrum is not diverging , nor growing at large frequencies as a result of the use of the transformation  . finally and most importantly , the spectrum is not monotonically decreasing but shows a distinctive and broad peak at @xmath176khz , rather close to the position of the expected fundamental @xmath165 qnm of the black hole and which we interpret as the excitation of the qnms of the black hole resulting from the perturbations induced by the oscillating torus .",
    "although its contribution is energetically very small ( _ i.e. _ less that @xmath177 of the total emitted energy is produced at frequencies larger than 2 khz ) , the ability to isolate this peak is of great importance to assess the validity of the hybrid approach and to prove its effectiveness in modelling black hole spacetimes .",
    "the presence of such a peak , in fact , is expected on the basis of simple considerations but was _ not detectable _ in the complementary work of nagar et al .",
    "@xcite based on a time - domain perturbative approach despite the corresponding psd reached values was well below the ones at which our black hole peak appears ( _ cf . _",

    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the gravitational - wave energy spectrum resulting from the hybrid approach employing the solution of the bpt equation [ _ cf . _ eq . ] for @xmath165 .",
    "as expected , much of what found for the rwz equations continues to hold when the hybrid approach is computed using the bpt equation , namely : very good match with the quadrupole approximation at low frequency where most of the energy is emitted and the appearance of a broad peak associated with the black hole quasi - normal ringing .",
    "we have presented a new _ hybrid _ approach to study the perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole excited by extended matter sources in which the solution in the _ time - domain _ of the relativistic hydrodynamical equations in a multidimensional spacetime is coupled to the solution in the _ frequency - domain _ of either the regge - wheeler / zerilli equations or of the bardeen - press - teukolsky equations .",
    "we believe that our hybrid approach may be preferrable over a pure time - domain approach based on the rwz equations for at least three different reasons .",
    "firstly , the regge - wheeler and the zerilli equations can not be generalized to rotating black holes , whereas the bpt equation admits such a generalization .",
    "secondly , the bpt equation is intrinsically unstable when integrated in the time domain but its solution is regular computed in the frequency domain .",
    "thirdly , for a system undergoing small oscillations around an equilibrium state , a frequency - domain approach is expected to be significantly more accurate than one based in the time - domain , especially at high frequencies , where the black hole contributions are expected to emerge . within this framework , therefore , the work presented here serves as a first step towards the study of the gravitational - wave emission from an extended source perturbing a rotating black hole .    as a test of its effectiveness and to provide a close comparison with what done so far in perturbative approaches based in the time - domain , _",

    "@xcite , we have considered as extended source to the perturbation equations the oscillations of a high - density torus orbiting around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the dynamics of the torus has been followed numerically using a 2d numerical code solving the general relativistic hydrodynamics equations using hrsc schemes in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "overall , the results of our study show that the hybrid approach ( either with the rwz equations or with the bpt one ) works remarkably well , producing an energy spectrum of the emitted gravitational radiation which contains both the basic quadrupolar emission of the torus as well as the excited emission of the black hole .",
    "the latter feature was completely washed out in the complementary time - domain approach of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "being totally generic , the formalism and methodology presented here is could be used under more general conditions and in particular also with sources coming from 3d numerical relativity codes as long as an accurate evolution of the matter sources is possible .",
    "future work in this line of research will therefore comprise both the extension of the present results to 3d codes , as well as the generalization of the perturbative formalism to the teukolsky equation in order to model the gravitational emission of rotating black holes when perturbed by extended sources .",
