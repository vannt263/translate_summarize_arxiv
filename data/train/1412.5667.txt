    "miniaturization caused mainly by the energy savings , speed and multi - functionality reasons is a strong driving force for the molecular basic research .",
    "the diodes , transistors , switches , memory cells , and sensors are currently designed from the molecular systems connected to the metallic or carbon leads.@xcite fabrication of organic devices is technologically simpler and its costs are lower .",
    "thus , the search for organic substitutes of inorganic systems is a vigorous branch.@xcite it is also dictated by the ecologic requirements since in the organic systems , the light atoms replace heavy - and toxic for the environment - elements .",
    "moreover , the relatively new field of molecular electronics intensively stimulates the development of methods.@xcite    the metallic leads are widely used for nano - device electronics,@xcite however recently , the carbon systems become more popular.@xcite this is mainly due to the better thermoelectric efficiency - which is a separate subject of investigations including the vibronic effects.@xcite therefore , we decided to use the carbon - nanotube ( cnt ) leads . to date , the carbon - system contacts to the metal leads were explored for c60,@xcite cnt@xcite and graphene.@xcite    various types of electrodes and nano - devices , as well as their functionalities , set requirements for the electronic contacts.@xcite their role has been addressed a decade ago,@xcite and it is still of major importance.@xcite all types of devices seek the low - resistivity contacts in order to avoid large heat dissipation.@xcite additionally , some contacts are designed to be spin - selective.@xcite switches , however , need contacts which are low - resistive , and additionally they amplify the current gear obtained at the transition between two , or more , molecular forms ; so an effect of the switched logic state is easily measured in the circuit .",
    "finding such contacts is the main goal of our study , since  according to our knowledge ",
    "it was not addressed up to date .",
    "molecular switches work under various external triggering stimuli : electric or magnetic field , light , temperature , chemical reaction , mechanical stress , radiation , etc.@xcite here , we focus on two classes of the molecular switches , which operate under the photo- or field - stimuli .",
    "the first group can operate at very low voltage , since the tautomeric transition is triggered by light , not by bias .",
    "the second group works in the wide range of voltages , set by the values of swapping biases  which are different for the state - on and the state - off .",
    "these voltages typically are higher than the low - bias regime in which the photo - switches operate .",
    "the higher - bias regime is more demanding for the electronic contacts .",
    "hence , it is much more difficult to obtain a high current gear for the field - switches than for the photo - switches .    in this work",
    ", we used the first - principles methods for the electronic - structure and ballistic - conductance calculations to obtain the current - voltage ( i - v ) curves for the tautomeric switches connected to the cnt leads .",
    "the studied photo- and field - switches base on the proton transfer between the oxygen and the nitrogen centers.@xcite the contacts are chosen among the light atoms or chemical groups : -c- , -c@xmath0c- , -o- , -o - o- , -s- , -cs@xmath1- , -ch@xmath2- , -nh- , as well as the direct connection to the cnt .",
    "some choices might appear fancy at the first sight , however the results on a nanoscale are often surprising.@xcite    interestingly , the switching voltages are not the properties of the conducting molecules only , but they depend strongly on the selected contacts . among the investigated in this work structures ,",
    "the cases with multiple negative differential resistance ( ndr ) show up , and they were described in our previous work as candidates for the high - frequency devices.@xcite",
    "it is a common practice that the sulfur contacts are used to connect a molecule to the metallic or carbon - based leads .",
    "some authors connect the molecule directly to the graphene surface or the carbon nanotube.@xcite here , we check some other possibilities . among others ,",
    "we explore the properties of acetylene ( -c@xmath0c- ) , oxygen ( -o- ) and peroxide ( -o - o- ) contacts . generally , the oxygen element is not popular as a contact .",
    "but when oxygen is added to some conductive structures , it can bring along a new physics.@xcite below , we report the results for the two types of molecular switches : triggered either by light or by voltage ; both are based on the proton transfer ( pt ) reaction along the intramolecular hydrogen - bond .",
    "the photo - switches discussed in this subsection , differ from the discussed hereafter field - switches by the fact , that their two photo - tautomeric structures form due to reversible photoinduced intramolecular proton - transfer process - while the field - switching induces this reaction in the ground electronic state .",
    "photo - switching of molecular conductance is studied for the two stable isomers of salicylidene methylamine ( sma).@xcite the photo - induced pt reaction occurs between the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group and the nitrogen atom of the amino group of sma.@xcite both respective photo - tautomeric forms - called the enol and keto - are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "additionally , these forms differ from each other by the conformation of the methylamine tail with respect to the salicylidene core.@xcite importance of the contact geometry for the transport properties has been shown for many systems.@xcite moreover , the properties of the junction may also depend on the cnt chirality , thus , all carbon electrodes considered in this work are of the zigzag type - the most effective form for the switches.@xcite    following the work by staykov et al.,@xcite we simulate transport in various structural connections to the leads : _ para _ , _ meta _ , and not studied earlier _ ortho _ - all displayed in fig .  1 . but our main aim is to check the switching impact of contacts , such as the direct connection , o and s atomic connections .",
    "the s and o connections form the angular structures with the cnt ( about 105 - 120 deg ) .",
    "in contrast , the direct connection is linear .",
    "additionally , the electronic conjugation of the phenyl ring of sma is extended by acetylenic moieties attached on its both sides ; so - called anchor groups .",
    "former studies of these molecules framed , however , between the metallic electrodes , have revealed that the _ meta _ connection is much more efficient for the photo - switching than the _ para _ one.@xcite in this work , we considered also the _ ortho _ structure .",
    "the obtained i - v curves are presented in fig .  2",
    "( details of the calculations are given in the methods section ) .",
    "focusing on the resistivity of the contacts and the connecting structures , generally it is not surprising that the sulfur atom is the best conductive contact within the range of applied bias ( about 2v ) .",
    "the _ meta _",
    "structures are much more conductive than the _ para _ , and also more than the _ ortho_. with an exception that for the direct connection , the _ meta _ and _ ortho _ geometries show similar currents for the enol and keto structures below 2v .",
    "transition voltages , in a sense of the voltage at which the current rises from zero for very small applied biases,@xcite are usually lower for -o- than -s- , and are the lowest for the direct connection .",
    "this fact sets the working bias - regimes : v@xmath3(direct )  @xmath4  v@xmath3(o )  @xmath4  v@xmath3(s ) .",
    "further inspection of the results presented in fig .",
    "2 leads to the following conclusions : ( i ) the most interesting result with respect to the current gain between the two isomeric forms at very low bias , up to 0.4v , is obtained for the cases : direct- and oxygen _ para _ and _ ortho _ , but it is not the case with the s contact , ( ii ) for the voltage around 2v , the best performing switches are : oxygen contacts and direct-_meta _ , and s-_meta _ and _ -ortho_. for some cases , the negative differential resistance is observed - especially with the direct contacts .",
    "this effect , however , does not exclude the device from operation if we choose the proper working bias - range ( @xmath40.4 - 0.8v ) .       and",
    "v@xmath1 , corresponding to the energy barrier - less transitions between the tautomeric forms : enol - keto and keto - enol , respectively .",
    "the curves ( a ) and ( b ) are calculated with b3lyp / cc - pvdz method for the 2ppy molecule terminated with the methyl groups.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and v@xmath1 , corresponding to the energy barrier - less transitions between the tautomeric forms : enol - keto and keto - enol , respectively . the curves ( a ) and ( b ) are calculated with b3lyp / cc - pvdz method for the 2ppy molecule terminated with the methyl groups.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and v@xmath1 , corresponding to the energy barrier - less transitions between the tautomeric forms : enol - keto and keto - enol , respectively . the curves ( a ) and ( b ) are calculated with b3lyp / cc - pvdz method for the 2ppy molecule terminated with the methyl groups.,title=\"fig : \" ]        the electric field applied to the molecule may tune the shape of the energetical landscape of the ground - electronic state and thus , it may change the relative stability of the two tautomeric forms of the molecule .",
    "one form which is the most stable without the e - field may become less stable or even unstable in the higher voltage values which favor another tautomeric form .",
    "in the studied case the enol form is the only stable form when no filed is applied , ( see fig 3a , black filled circles ) . to stabilize the keto form one must apply the electric field along the main exes of the molecule , which is also the direction of the proton transfer between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms which transforms enol into the keto form .",
    "the distance between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms , r(oh ) , is the best choice of a driving coordinate for an illustrative description of the process . to characterize the process in more detail",
    ", we construct the minimum - energy profile ( mep ) along the driving coordinate . along the mep",
    ", all the intramolecular nuclear degrees of freedom are optimized for a given frozen value of the driving coordinate r(oh ) .",
    "separate ground - state meps are calculated for different values of the electric field applied to the molecule .",
    "bias values in v are given in fig .",
    "3a above the corresponding mep additionally distinguished with shape and color those indicate changes in the ground - state energy landscape : the heights of the enol - to - keto and keto - to - enol tautomerization - reaction barriers and the stabilization energy of both forms .",
    "meps plotted in fig .",
    "3a represent relative energy normalized at r(oh)=1.4  .",
    "potential - energy profiles sketched in fig .",
    "3a result in a hysteresis of the field - induced switching between the tautomeric forms of the 2ppy molecule terminated with the methyl groups .",
    "the ` hysteresis ' curve presented in fig .",
    "3b represents minimum - energy of a given tautomeric form normalized vs. the mean energy of both tautomeric forms ( the zero - energy of the scale ) at the applied value of bias .",
    "one can see that both tautomeric forms of 2ppy can coexist within a given range of the applied voltage , the terminal values of which define the limits v@xmath5 and v@xmath1 , where the pt process enol - to - keto and keto - to - enol takes place , respectively .",
    "the switching values of the voltage impose the limits on the i - v characteristics computed for a given tautomeric form ( fig .",
    "the operation mode of the device is as follows : we start from the enol form , and when the voltage is increased to the value higher than v@xmath5 , the molecule switches to the keto form .",
    "then , the bias is decreased down to the second switching voltage v@xmath1 , and the reversed transformation to the enol form occurs .",
    "this effect shows up as a jump of the current flowing via the molecule ( fig .",
    "3c ) .    similarly to the photo - switches discussed above , also for the field - switches , different geometric connections to the cnt can be realized ; they are presented in fig .",
    "4a-4d . in fig .  4e",
    ", we show the zigzag geometry of the peroxy ( -o - o- ) contact , in contrast to the linear geometry of the acetylenic ( -c@xmath0c- ) one .",
    "the contact via the cs@xmath1 planar group is depicted in fig .",
    "it is interesting to explore the cs@xmath1 group , since it has been announced as very low - resistive contact for gold leads , characterized by low electronic work - function.@xcite to complete these studies , we add also the -ns@xmath1- connection to our list ( in the same geometry as the -cs@xmath1- contact ) .",
    "it has been experimentally evidenced that the field - switching is a robust property of a molecule , and not a stochastic phenomenon.@xcite we show in this work , that the switching effect is not only a property of the molecule but also strongly depends on the chosen contact .",
    "as one may notice inspecting fig .  4 ,",
    "the single - branched contacts might be arranged to the 2ppy switch in the three - fold manner as : left , right- or central configuration .",
    "the double - branched contacts were studied earlier by us and showed the negative differential resistance,@xcite which in some cases can exclude the system as a candidate for a switch .",

    "4a-4d . for completeness",
    ", we also show the tautomeric switching biases for the bare molecule - not connected to the leads .",
    "inspection of these results leads to the following conclusions : ( i ) the operating voltage range for a given tautomeric form , v@xmath5-v@xmath1 , is relatively wide ( several volts ) , ( ii ) various contacts and structures introduce large diversification of the work regimes .",
    "what is very important , the relatively large switching bias in some cases is perhaps too high for technological applications .",
    "it is generally more practical , for stability reasons , to utilize the device operating under a lower transition ( v@xmath1 ) .",
    "although , in reality the theoretically predicted demands are overestimated .",
    "the calculated bariers would be much smaller when the temperature , vibrational , interface and tunneling effects were included.@xcite analyzing the results obtained for different connections presented in table  1 , one may state that the double - branch and right-single - branch structures seem to be the best promising choice ( smaller v@xmath1 ) . while the larger v@xmath1 values are given for the left-single - branch connections , and",
    "the single - branch central connections are characterized by the highest switching biases . on the other hand , as we will see hereafter , the latter case is the only non - ndr case which is stable with respect to switching .",
    "the i - v curves computed for single - branch side connections , left and right , are depicted in fig .",
    "these curves correspond to the structures shown in fig .",
    "the ndr effect seen in some cases is very often detected in the triangular lattices , such as graphene and some organic molecules.@xcite here , we observe the ndr for the single - branch left- and right-side structures ( fig .  5 ) , and this effect is even stronger than for the double - branch case.@xcite this is generally an undesired effect with respect to the switching performance .",
    "some remedy for this problem possibly could be found using longer anchor groups , since a suppression of the quantum conductance oscillations ( leading also to the ndr effect ) was reported.@xcite on the other hand , the energetic barriers to be conquered in the course of the pt process are not very high ( c.f .",
    "3a ) and the vibrational or thermal effects may lower them , as mentioned earlier . thus , moving the transitions to the next bias - point ( v@xmath5 to lower , and v@xmath1 to higher ) narrowing the hysteretic loop and shifting the operation region to the non - ndr part .",
    "the work regimes , chosen for the lower transitions at v@xmath1 , are marked in the i - v characteristics by dashed green lines . despite the ndr effect existing in all cases in fig .",
    "5 , the -nh- and -s- left-side contacts seem to be promissing for technological applications , due to a large gear of the enol and keto currents in the vicinity of the switching bias .    finally , the single - branch central structures were analyzed with respect to their i - v properties ;",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "one can notice , upon inspection of the figure , that the keto to enol switching voltage is the lowest for the case of the direct connection to the leads .",
    "moreover , for the direct contact , as well as for the acetylenic ( -c@xmath0c- ) and oxygenic ( -o- ) bridges , the i - v curves of two tautomers are almost identical to each other .",
    "it is not surprising result , since for the high voltage the following observations are true :    * the range of the quantum - conductance function entering the current equation ( see methods section ) is large , * the projected density of states ( pdos ) of the o - h - n group in the enol and keto structures lay closer to the fermi level than the voltage range which enters the i - v formula .",
    "therefore , all details differentiating one tautomer from the other are summed - up in the transmission function to the similar values of the current .",
    "if the operating voltage range falls within the range where the characteristic parameters of the tautomers differ , then the current curves of the tautomers also differ .",
    "c- ( cc ) and -o - o- ( oo ) , obtained at bias 6v ; the enol is marked in black upside and keto in red downside .",
    "numbers are values of the current [ in @xmath10a ] at 6v from fig .",
    "pdos of the @xmath11-states of the cc and oo contacts and the cnt terminal carbons connected to the contacts . ]",
    "the most important result of this section is the conclusion that for the peroxy ( -o - o- ) contact , a good current - gear for the switching at high voltage ( @xmath125v ) is obtained .",
    "it is not advantageous property of the peroxy contacts that they are more resistive than the acetylenic ones ( -c@xmath0c- ) .",
    "but the peroxy contacts strengthen the diversity of the conductances of different molecular structures - and this is what we need .    since the sulfur contact is an electron - rich and highly polarizable moiety , the existence of undesired ndr effect in this case is not surprising for larger biases.@xcite we obtained nicely separated enol and keto current curves for -cs@xmath1- at voltages between 3.5v and 5.5v .",
    "it is of little practical use , however , due to the fact that the switching voltage with increasing bias ( v@xmath5 ) is for this contact higher than 15v - up to the checked pes ( see table  1 ) ; and we did not observe switching to the keto structure . also the current values for the enol and keto forms show a tendency to join each other at biases higher than 6v .",
    "the electrical conductivity can be derived from the orbitals hybridization of the conducting molecule , atomic contacts and the leads - those orbitals , which energetically lay close to the fermi level .",
    "therefore , plots of the pdos tell us about reasons for the existence of the quantum conductance peaks or their absence . of course , not all states visible on the pdos plots contribute to the current . in our systems , there are the lone electron pairs and the molecular orbitals orthogonal to the conduction direction . on the other hand ,",
    "it is trivial that the lack of states in some energetic region results to no current .    in figs .",
    "7 and 8 , we plot the quantum conductance ( qc ) and pdos of photo- and field - switches for selected contacts , for which the i - v curves were presented in figs . 2 and 6 . the electric fields at which the qc and pdos plots have been obtained correspond to the bias 0.4v and 2v for the photo - switches",
    "( in fig . 7 ) and 6v for the field - switches",
    "( in fig . 8) . for convenience ,",
    "the corresponding values of the current [ in @xmath10a ] are written in the top panels .",
    "transition voltage is the bias at which the current starts to grow from zero.@xcite in the case of photo - switches operating at very low bias regime , the working voltages of the device are in the range where the enol and keto forms show different transition voltages .",
    "the lowest transition biases are for the direct contact , medium for oxygen and higher for the sulfur contacts . following the discussion by wu et al.,@xcite",
    "the largest transition voltages are obtained for those atomic contacts whose @xmath11-states lay higher in the energy above the fermi level .",
    "this is also true for the photo - switches and the pdos presented in fig .",
    "the position of the @xmath11-states of the anchor group and the contact and the terminal carbon of the cnt lead is the highest in a case of the sulfur contact . for the direct contacts , these states are the most close to the fermi level of all studied connections .",
    "the above sequence corresponds to the obtained current gears .",
    "the states which originate from the lonely pairs , or the orbitals non - overlapping with the conduction axis , do not contribute to the quantum conductance .",
    "as for the resistance related problems , it has been stressed in many reports - for instance in the recent work by schulz et al.@xcite - that the fermi level mismatch of the conductor and leads is responsible for the low conductance . actually , for a good the switch , one tautomeric form should be very resistive and the other well conducting in the device - operating bias region .",
    "in contrast to the bias regime of 0.4v ( upper panels ) , for 2v ( lower panel ) the best performing contact is that with sulfur , and the next of oxygen .",
    "the low transition bias of the direct contacts does not work for the switch in the higher voltage range .",
    "this is because all pdos diversities of the enol and keto forms are summed - up to similar values when the bias range is larger . instead ,",
    "for the oxygen and sulfur contacts , not all pdos mismatches between two tautomers appear in the bias range of 2v .    for the field - swithes operating at higher voltages - around 5 - 6v -",
    "the situation is more difficult .",
    "one needs to find such contacts , that the nonsymmetric contributions to the pdos from the tautomers do not sum - up in the qc to similar values of current . in a case of the -c@xmath0c- contacts ,",
    "the quantum conductance spectra of tautomers are nonsymmetric but sum to the similar currents ( see fig .  8) . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonsymmetric qc spectra of the peroxy contacts give a good current gear .",
    "after inspection of the pdos in the range of [ -3,3 ] ev , the intensities of the acetoxy states are much smaller than the states of the peroxy case .",
    "therefore , the tautomeric diversity is strengthened in the peroxy - contacts case , and they are the only contacts - of all studied here - which could work for the field - switches .    since the energetic positions of the contact states are very important , we emphasize that the simple dft method does not reproduce them well .",
    "one should go beyond this approximation , and for instance the self - interaction corrections ( asic ) and the constrained dft ( cdft ) method have been applied for the effect of the hydrogenetation on the sulfur contacts in the bdt - gold molecular junction.@xcite on the other hand , our leads and conductors are mainly carbonic , and not metallic .",
    "in contrast to the large underestimation of the energy gap in diamond by simple dft scheme , the carbonic conductive systems , such as graphene and carbon nanotubes , are well described within this method - the same as the band structures of simple metals .",
    "the dft failur very strongly shows up when the metallic and non - metallic elements are combined , and the localized atomic - like @xmath13-states ( or @xmath14-states ) form .",
    "the relative position of these metallic states , with respect to the @xmath15-states of the non - metallic atoms , is usually placed too shallow below the fermi level ( or the highest occupied molecular orbital , homo , level ) .",
    "similarly , the corresponding energies of the unoccupied metallic - states reside too low above the conduction band minimum ( or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , lumo , level ) .",
    "such situation leads to large overestimation of the calculated conductance .",
    "the systems studied in this work are purely non - metallic , therefore , they are free of the above described mismatch of the two kinds of the energy levels .    since in this work , we studied an impact of the geometry on the current , another interesting phenomenon could be addressed in a future work - namely , the current - driven geometric and electronic structure rearrangements .",
    "these effects would lead to the non - linear conduction characteristics and different switching properties .",
    "such studies within the time - dependent ehrenfest formalism were reported for the metallic clusters.@xcite",
    "we searched for electronic contacts which strengthen the switching properties of the molecular devices based on the intramolecular proton transfer process .",
    "two classes of model molecular photo- and field - switches , operating at lower- and higher - bias work regime , respectively , were analyzed . by means of the first - principles electronic calculations",
    ", we found the electronic structure , wannier functions , and the electronic transport properties ( the i - v curves ) .",
    "the larger difference between the currents of the swapped structures , the better is the performance of a switch .",
    "moreover , we would like to have low - resistive contacts , but the mechanism of the current on - off switching with applied bias and the rules governing the resistance stay in the opposition to each other .",
    "it is demonstrated that for very low- and higher - bias work regimes , the efficient contacts are chosen according to different effects : ( i ) the transition voltage for the current - on switch and ( ii ) the resistive conformational selectivity , respectively . the low - bias operating range ( @xmath120.5v ) of photo - switches prefers the direct connection with leads , which is low - resistive .",
    "for the middle voltage work regime ( 1 - 2v ) , the oxygen or sulfur are the best atomic contacts .",
    "the high - bias operating range ( @xmath94v ) of the field - switches choses the peroxy contacts .",
    "in addition , we found that the transition voltages of the field - switches are very sensitive to the choice of contacts .",
    "this is caused mainly by differences in the polarizabilities of the atomic contacts .",
    "we performed the density - functional theory@xcite calculations of the molecules between the cnt leads using the plane - wave quantum espresso code.@xcite these self - consistent runs were repeated for many discrete external electric fields with a step visible in the reported figures .",
    "then the obtained bloch functions were used to generate maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf)@xcite employing the wannier90 - 2.0.0 code.@xcite the same package was then utilized for the transport calculations within the landauer - bttiker scheme.@xcite the obtained quantum conductance ( or transmission ) for each electric field , t(@xmath16;e@xmath12v ) , was embedded in the equation@xcite @xmath17 t(\\varepsilon;e ) d\\varepsilon \\nonumber\\ ] ] with the fermi - dirac distribution f(@xmath16 ) .",
    "this way , we reach the current i at the bias v which is equivalent to the external electric field e assumed in the dft calculations",
    ".    to estimate the voltage values necessary to switch the transistor forms , the enol to the keto and back to the enol , we optimized the geometry of the molecule at discrete values of the applied electric field ( with the step of 0.001 a.u . ) .",
    "the dft method implemented in turbomole [ 57 ] was used in these calculations along with the b3lyp functional and correlation - consistent valence double - zeta atomic basis set with polarization functions for all atoms ( cc - pvdz)@xcite for thoroughly studied exemplar ppy molecule terminated with methyl groups . for all other ppy derivatives the default def - sv(p ) basis set was used in search of their characteristic v1 and v2 switching bias values .    as for the plane - wave calculations setup , the blyp functional was used . the energy cutoff for the plane - waves in the quantum espresso code",
