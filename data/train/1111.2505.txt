    "the possibility of relative motion of the walls @xcite in multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwnts ) makes it promising to use nanotube walls as movable elements of nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) ( see @xcite for a review ) . at present , nanomotors in which the walls of a mwnt play the role of the shaft and the bush @xcite and memory cells operating on relative sliding of the walls along the nanotube axis @xcite have been implemented . a number of nems have been proposed , which operate on the relative motion of carbon nanotube walls , including a gigahertz oscillator @xcite , brownian nanomotor @xcite , a bolt / nut pair @xcite and an accelerometer @xcite .",
    "thus the study of relative motion and interaction of carbon nanotube walls is an actual problem .",
    "however neither the interaction between carbon nanotube walls nor the interaction between graphene layers have been investigated in details .",
    "the measurements of the energy of interaction between graphite layers give the wide scatter of the results ( see @xcite and references in @xcite ) .",
    "though experimental value of the interwall interaction energy is available ( @xmath0 mev per atom @xcite ) , any measurements of barriers to relative motion of walls of carbon nanotubes are absent up to now .",
    "only upper limits of the shear strength for the relative motion of the walls along the nanotube axis were measured in a few experiments @xcite .",
    "no experimental data on the barriers to relative motion of graphene layers are available .",
    "the value of the critical shear strength for graphite measured in the only known experiment @xcite is related to macroscopic structural defects of the graphite sample",
    ". therefore the theoretical studies are particularly valuable for understanding phenomena and elaboration of nems related with relative motion and interaction of carbon nanotube walls .    for existing experimental realizations of relative motion of walls of carbon nanotubes ,",
    "the movable walls are walls of mwnts and have relatively great diameters : @xmath1 nm at the relative sliding of the inner core of the walls attached to nanomanipulator @xcite , @xmath2 nm in the nanomotors @xcite , and @xmath3 nm in the memory cells operating on relative sliding of the walls along the nanotube axis @xcite .",
    "therefore it is probably that pioneering measurements of the barriers to the relative motion of the walls will be performed for mwnts with great diameter .",
    "however _ all previous theoretical considerations _ of the barriers to relative motion of walls deal with double - walled carbon nanotubes ( dwnts ) with diameters less than 3 nm @xcite .",
    "that is the considered nanotubes do not correspond to the diameter range for which the experimental support can be expected first .",
    "moreover the dwnts with diameter greater than 5 nm have collapsed structure @xcite .",
    "therefore , calculations of the barriers to the relative motion of the adjacent walls of the mwnts with a wide range of diameters , as well as measurements of these barriers are necessary for further progress in elaboration of nanotube - based nems and for verification of theoretical methods for consideration of interaction between nanotube walls and graphene layers .    in the present work we study the dependencies of nanotube properties related with the interwall interaction on diameter of the walls .",
    "for this purpose we perform the first calculations of the interwall interaction energies , as well as the barriers to relative sliding of the adjacent walls along the nanotube axis for a wide range of the wall diameter .",
    "the results of these calculations are used to estimate the following physical quantities : the shear strength for the relative sliding of walls along the nanotube axis , the frequency of the relative axial oscillations and diffusion coefficient for the short outer wall placed in the middle of the nanotube , the maximum overlap of the inner and outer walls for which the controlled reversible telescoping can be achieved ( the pulled - out core of the inner walls could be completely pushed back by capillary forces restoring a nanotube to its original retracted condition ) .",
    "the possibilities of experimental study of these quantities is discussed .",
    "comparison of experimental and calculated values of these quantities can be used as a criterion for the correctness of the results of calculations of the barriers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to analysis of the wall structure and the interwall interaction to prove the choice of pairs of adjacent walls for the present study .",
    "section iii presents the details of computational technique .",
    "section iv gives the results of calculations of the interwall interaction energies , and the barriers to the relative sliding of the walls , as well as estimations of the physical quantities based on these barriers .",
    "section v presents discussion of possibility of experimental study of these quantities and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "neglecting their structure at the ends , which can be either open or closed , carbon nanotubes are single or multiple layers of a cylinder rolled up from graphene sheets . only one parameter is needed to fully determine the structure of the middle section of a single - walled carbon nanotube ( swnt ) or a wall of a mwnt : the chirality index @xmath4 which corresponds to a two - dimensional lattice vector @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the unit vectors of graphene @xcite .",
    "a segment defined by the vector @xmath8 becomes the circumference of cylindrical surface of a nanotube wall .",
    "two types of swnt ( nonchiral swnt ) characterized by the chirality index of @xmath9 and @xmath10 have a simple translational symmetry , and these are referred to as armchair and zigzag nanotubes forming different pattern of hexagons in circumference .",
    "the adjacent walls of nanotube are commensurate if the ratio of the lengths of their unit cells is a rational fraction . in this case , a pair of walls can be considered as a quasi - one - dimensional crystal with the length of unit cell equal to the lowest common factor of the lengths of unit cells of constituent walls .",
    "if the length of the wall overlap is considerably greater than the length of the unit cell , barriers to the relative motion of the commensurate walls are approximately proportional to the length of the wall overlap : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the barrier per unit cell and @xmath13 is the number of unit cells corresponding to the wall overlap . conceivably , it is possible to control the barriers to relative motion of the commensurate walls .",
    "lack of commensurability between the adjacent walls implies a dramatic weakening of the corrugation in the interwall interaction energy potential surface @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the commensurate case , barriers to relative motion of incommensurate walls of do not increase with the length of the wall overlap , but fluctuate near the average value @xcite .",
    "these incommensurate systems , even if the wall overlap exceed micron in length , have barriers to the relative motion of the walls comparable to those with a wall overlap of a single unit cell in length .    for adjacent commensurate walls , at least one of which is chiral , the interwall interaction energy potential surface is extremely flat and corrugations of the surface are smaller than the accuracy of calculations @xcite .",
    "this is so because only very high harmonics of the fourier transform of the interaction energy @xmath14 between an atom of one wall and the entire other wall make contributions to the potential barriers due to the incompatibility of the helical symmetries of the walls @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of chiral walls , _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the certain dwnts @xcite as well as calculations using empirical potentials @xcite show that dwnts with the nonchiral commensurate walls ( i.e. both armchair or both zigzag ) have considerable barriers to relative motion of walls .",
    "therefore , the pairs of the nonchiral commensurate walls can be considered as potential components in nems for which a precise control of motion or position of the walls is required .",
    "a wide set of such nems which operating principle are based on the dependence of the conductivity or / and the interwall interaction energy on the relative position of the walls on subnanometer scales was proposed .",
    "this set includes now a varying nanoresistor @xcite , a stress nanosensor @xcite , an electromechanical nanothermometer @xcite , a nanoactuator for the transformation of a force directed along the nanotube axis to the relative rotation of its walls @xcite , and a nanoresonator @xcite .",
    "thus , analysis of the relative motion and interaction of nonchiral commensurate carbon nanotube walls holds the key to success of these applications .",
    "moreover , due to considerable value of the barriers to relative motion of walls , nanotubes with such walls should be considered as best candidates for measurements of these barriers .",
    "since the system consisting of two nonchiral commensurate walls with great radius has the unit cell which contains up to several thousands atoms , _ ab initio _ calculations are not available for such a system .",
    "thus we perform empirical calculations of the interwall interaction energy and the barriers to the relative motion of the nonchiral commensurate walls with the aim to obtain the qualitative dependencies of these quantities on the wall radius .",
    "the interaction between atoms of adjacent walls is described here by 6 - 12 lenard - jones potential @xmath15 .",
    "note that contribution of many - body terms into the complete van der waals interaction is not essential at relative motion of linear clusters interacting along its full length @xcite .",
    "the parameters of potential , @xmath16 mev and @xmath17  , were fitted to interlayer distance and modulus of elasticity of graphite and used in study of the interwall interaction energypotential surface of the dwnts @xcite .",
    "the upper cutoff distance of the potential is chosen so that calculate the barriers to the relative sliding of the walls with the accuracy 0.1 % .",
    "namely , the upper cutoff distance is 42 , 120 , 25 and 35    for ( @xmath18,@xmath18)@(@xmath18 + 5,@xmath18 + 5 ) , ( @xmath18,@xmath18)@(@xmath18 + 6,@xmath18 + 6 ) , ( @xmath18,0)@(@xmath18 + 9,0 ) , and ( @xmath18,0)@(@xmath18 + 10,0 ) pairs of adjacent walls , respectively .",
    "the length of the outer wall is equal to the length of the unit cell and the length of the inner wall is chosen so that all pairs of atoms with interatomic distances within the cutoff distance are taken into consideration .",
    "the structure of the walls is obtained by mapping of graphene with bond length @xmath19    on cylindrical surface .",
    "the walls are considered as rigid .",
    "account of the deformation of walls is not essential for the shape of potential surface both for the interwall interaction energy of dwnts @xcite and the intershell interaction energy of carbon nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "for example , the barriers to the relative wall rotation and sliding along the axis for the ( 5,5)@(10,10 ) dwnt calculated for walls with unannealed structure @xcite coincide within 14 % with results of dresselhaus _ et al . _",
    "( used annealed wall structure ) @xcite .",
    "note also that 6 - 12 lenard - jones potential was used to study the dependencies of the ground state interwall interaction energy @xcite and radial breathing mode frequencies @xcite as function of radius and chiral angle of walls for dwnts with chiral walls and to determine characteristics of nanotube - based bolt / nut pairs @xcite .     of the inner and outer walls which passes through the midpoint of the carbon bond , point b corresponds to the coincident axis @xmath20 of the inner wall which passes through the midpoint of the carbon bond and axis @xmath20 of the outer wall which passes through the center of the hexagon",

    ", we must calculate the ntershell interaction energy potential surface , i.e. the dependence of the energy @xmath22 of the interaction between two adjacent walls on the coordinates describing the relative position of the walls ( angle @xmath23 of the relative rotation of the walls about the nanotube axis and length @xmath24 of the relative displacement of the walls along this axis ) .",
