    "( _ the preprint is a working paper",
    ". it will be further revised .",
    "comments are welcome . _ )    in complex systems modeling as networks @xcite , the constituents are considered as nodes or vertices , and interactions are considered as links or arcs .",
    "there are many examples of the embedded structure in networks showing a dynamical significance .",
    "the intertwined complexity of the structural topology and the dynamical behaviors is especially typical in directed networks . from the structural side , the strongly connected components ( scc ) of the directed networks @xcite , in which any two nodes has certain path following consecutive and non - intersecting directed arcs to each other ,",
    "is a well - known indicator as the cohesion of the networks . from the dynamical side , in many complex systems with directed interactions , the delicate control mechanisms to maintain stable functioning against external perturbations ( such as circadian rhythm in animals and plants ) or some irreversible decision - making processes ( such as apoptosis of cells and cancer growth in human tissues ) are results of architecture of feedback loops @xcite , and the dynamics of an interaction topology without feedback loops are relatively easy to be driven @xcite .",
    "our starting point for the paper is a simple truth that _ all _ the sccs are simply the collection of all the loops or cycles in the graphs or networks .",
    "an intuitive question naturally arises : how we can disrupt _ all _ the sccs , correspondingly _ all _ the loops , by the removal of a minimal number of nodes or arcs thus there are only tree - like structures left with trivially dynamical significance ?    the optimal network disruption problem is closely related to the study on network resilience and robustness @xcite since the inception of the network research and the optimal percolation @xcite and network attack problem @xcite yet distances itself from them as it provides an optimization perspective on the destruction protocol of directed networks , a more realistic model of description of interactions in real interacted systems .",
    "the arc direction in networks leads to much different handling methods with previous research on the optimization problem : we focus on the sccs rather than weakly connected components ( the largest component of the nodes while every two nodes have certain directed paths between them ) @xcite as the former has a more involved significance in the dynamics apart from the structure ; we consider the removal of _ all _ the sccs rather than the _ giant _ strongly connected component ( gscc ) , thus result in a principled method without the problem of thresholding in finite graphs ( the definition of how microscopic is microscopic ) as present in the case of undirected networks considering the giant connected component .",
    "as a starting point of the problem in this paper , we present the equivalence of _ all _ the strongly connected components and _ all _ the loops or cycles in the same network instance .",
    "a directed network @xmath0 has a vertex set @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and an arc set @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) with the arc density @xmath5 .",
    "an arc @xmath6 is an ordered pair of nodes with the predecessor @xmath7 pointing to the successor @xmath8 .",
    "a path between two nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a consecutive sequence of arcs such as @xmath11 ( which afterwards can be easily denoted as @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 arcs which are non - intersecting ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the sccs of network @xmath15 are those clusters of nodes in each of which any two nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 have a certain path to each other : if node @xmath7 has a path to node @xmath8 as @xmath16 , and node @xmath8 has a path to node @xmath7 as @xmath17 , then these two combined paths form a cycle or loop as @xmath18 , or a consecutive and non - intersecting closed sequence of arcs .",
    "thus _ all _ the sccs for a directed network is simply the aggregate structure of the nodes and arcs in _ all _ of its cycles .",
    "two methods ( a leaf removal method and tarjan s method @xcite ) to decompose a directed network into sccs and a reproduction of the mean - field theory for the gscc can be found in supplementary information section i.",
    "the destruction of _ all _ the sccs in a directed system corresponds to the removal of all the cycles in the same system .",
    "two simple procedures to remove all the cycles can be considered : the removal of vertices ( along with all their adjacent arcs ) , correspondingly the finding of a disruption vertex set ( dvs ) is just the feedback vertex set problem ( fvs ) and the finding of a minimal disruption vertex set ( mdvs ) is just the minimal feedback vertex set problem ( mfvs ) ; the removal of arcs , correspondingly the finding of a disruption arc set ( das ) is just the feedback arc set problem ( fas ) , and the finding of a minimal disruption arc set ( mdas ) is just the minimal feedback arc set problem ( mfas ) @xcite . in a general case , each vertex or arc has a predefined positive weight to account their cost in the removal process , and the total cost to minimize can be further defined as the sum of weights of the disruption vertex or arc set .",
    "both mfvs and mfas are non - deterministically polynomial - hard ( np - hard ) problems @xcite which in the worst case have an exact algorithm with an exponential computation time of the problem size ( such as the size of vertices of the graphs on which the problem is defined ) .",
    "the mfas can be considered as the mfvs on a transformed directed graphs , and can also be considered as a minimum dominating set problem ( mds ) @xcite of a bipartite graph of vertices and arcs ( supplementary information section ii ) .",
    "an example of the optimal network disruption problem on a small directed graph is in fig.[fig : cycles ] .    here",
    "we consider the mdas / mfas problem on directed graphs , since the removal of arcs is a more controlled way of local perturbation of network structure .",
    "( afterwards , das and fas are used interchangeably . )",
    "optimization problems usually concerns finding the minimal energy among the configurations which satisfy all the constraints defined on the graph structure . generally speaking ,",
    "typical types of the constraints are local constraints and global constraints .",
    "local constraints are usually formulated on arcs or vertices with their nearest neighbors , whose local structures makes them relatively direct for an adoption of the cavity method from spin glass theory @xcite . yet , the evaluation of each global constraint needs considering a non - localized structure or even all the nodes or links of the graph , which brings along severe difficulty in introducing statistical mechanical approaches .",
    "that is why the optimal network disruption problem needs more involved methods to tackle than the above - mentioned hard problems .",
    "typical optimizations with global constraints are the prize - collecting steiner tree problem @xcite , the feedback vertex set problem on undirected graphs @xcite , which devise tailored auxiliary methods to transform the global constraints into a localized form thus make possible the application of the statistical mechanical method .",
    "here we follow the same logic to apply a representation to render the global constraints on loops localized before we apply the cavity method .",
    "for a directed graph @xmath0 with a vertex set @xmath19 and an arc set @xmath20 , each arc @xmath6 has a predefined positive weight @xmath21 as the cost of removing the arc .",
    "if we only consider the size of disruption arc set , the weight can be set uniform . on each node",
    "@xmath7 we assign a positive integer @xmath22 $ ] as its height , while @xmath23 is the maximal height chosen for @xmath15 .",
    "thus we have a height configuration as @xmath24 .",
    "to account the direction on each arc @xmath6 , we define a height relation as @xmath25 , which is much like a potential decreasing along the arc direction . yet",
    "the existence of cycles leads to at least one arcs violating the height relation in each cycle .",
    "for example , in a small cycle with only three arcs @xmath26 , we can not satisfy such a height configuration as @xmath27 .",
    "the cycles thus bring a nontrivial effect on the assignment of heights on a directed graph simply based on the height relation and the direction of each arc .",
    "removal of all the arcs with end - nodes violating the height relation leaves a height configuration with satisfied height relation on all the residual arcs , correspondingly an acyclic directed graph .",
    "thus all the arcs violating the height relation constitute a fas @xmath28 . to be quantitative , for any directed arc @xmath29 ,",
    "a binary state @xmath30 is defined as @xmath6 being in a fas @xmath28 ( @xmath31 ) or not ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "then for the ease of discussion , on any arc @xmath6 with @xmath33 $ ] , a compact form of the height constraint can be defined as    @xmath34 [ 1 - \\delta _ { s_{ij}}^{0}],\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the heaviside function as @xmath36 when @xmath37 and @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "for any directed arc @xmath6 , @xmath40 is @xmath41 only if @xmath42 @xmath25 while @xmath6 does nt belong to a fas @xmath28 , or @xmath43 @xmath44 while @xmath6 belongs to @xmath28 .",
    "when each directed arc @xmath29 satisfies the constraint @xmath45 , the set of arcs with @xmath31 constitutes a fas @xmath28 , and the set of arcs with @xmath32 ( or @xmath46 ) forms an acyclic directed graph , correspondingly with no scc . with the language of height configuration ,",
    "we reformulate the fas problem as : given a finite maximal height @xmath23 , we assign the heights on nodes with as many satisfied height relation as @xmath25 for any arc @xmath6 as possible , and a fas is the set of the arcs @xmath28 violating height relations with a total weight @xmath47 .    for a finite @xmath23 , a height configuration with satisfied height constraints on each arc with a fas",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to a fragmentation of directed networks into multiple segments with a largest difference of heights on vertices @xmath48 and without any circle . only in the case",
    "as @xmath23 is large enough , all the cycles with arbitrary length in an arbitrary given graph can be removed without redundant arc contribution from loops or paths with length @xmath49 , and the mfas problem can be defined .",
    "thus the finite @xmath23 case provides an upper bound for the size of mfas .",
    "based on the height representation , we can define a spin glass model for the mfas problem on a directed graph @xmath0 . for a maximal height @xmath23 and the reweighting parameter @xmath50 ( inverse temperature )",
    ", we have the partition function as      the partition function sums on the contribution from all the height configuration @xmath52 with a total size @xmath53 , and only those @xmath52 as all arcs @xmath6 with @xmath54 contribute to the partition function . as an optimization problem ,",
    "we minimize the weight sum on a fas as @xmath55 $ ] for a given @xmath23 and @xmath50 , and the mfas problem is just the case with large enough @xmath23 and @xmath50 .    in the framework of cavity method of the spin glass theory @xcite , we further derive the belief propagation algorithm for the spin glass model . on",
    "each directed arc @xmath6 , a set of four cavity messages @xmath56 are defined with the normalization @xmath57 : @xmath58 is defined as the probability that the node @xmath7 having a height @xmath59 when the height constraint on @xmath6 is removed , @xmath60 the probability that the node @xmath8 having a height @xmath61 satisfying the height constraint on @xmath6 when @xmath8 is removed , @xmath62 the probability that the node @xmath8 having a height @xmath61 when the height constraint on @xmath6 is removed , @xmath63 the probability that the node @xmath7 having a height @xmath59 satisfying the height constraint on @xmath6 when @xmath7 is removed .",
    "we can understand this spin glass model in a factor graph representation as used frequently in hard satisfiability problem @xcite : any node @xmath7 with a height @xmath59 is a variable node , while the height constraint @xmath40 on any arc @xmath6 can be considered as a function node accounting the interaction between the two variable nodes .",
    "the bethe - peierls approximation @xcite assumes a trivial correlation among the nearest neighbors of any vertex if the vertex is removed , leading to the marginal probability as a factorization of cavity messages , which produces exact results in tree - like structure in a sparse random graph .",
    "the marginal @xmath64 for any arc @xmath6 , or the probability that it belongs to a fas @xmath28 , can be expressed with the above defined cavity probabilities as          while @xmath68 is the set of all the incoming nearest neighbors ( predecessors ) of node @xmath7 , @xmath69 as the set of all the out - going nearest neighbors ( successors ) of node @xmath7 , @xmath70 as the exclusion of @xmath71 from a set , @xmath72 as corresponding normalization factors .    with the converged cavity messages , the estimated weight sum of the mfas is @xmath73 , correspondingly the energy density of the spin glass model is @xmath74 .",
    "a more easy - to - understand quantity of mfas is the occupation density @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the weight sum of all arcs .",
    "other thermodynamic quantities of the spin glass model , such as the free energy density and the entropy density can be found in supplementary information section iii , where the details of the implementation of belief - propagation algorithms on graph ensembles and graph instances are presented .",
    "we further apply tarjan s method and bpd method on the randomized counterparts of the @xmath77 real networks with different types of interactions in the main text . in the randomization scheme for the real network instances ,",
    "we maintain the connection topology yet set the direction of each arc to the original direction or its reversion with an equal probability .",
    "see the results in fig.[fig : real_realad ] .",
    "we can see that among the @xmath77 real networks in different types , most networks , especially the networks with biological functions ( @xmath78 of the @xmath79 regulatory networks , neuronal networks , and ecosystem networks ) and networks with social interactions ( internet networks and the wikivote network ) have smaller scc sizes and fas sizes compared with their randomized counterparts .",
    "one type of the biological networks ( the metabolic networks ) behave quite differently from other biological networks , as they have larger scc sizes and fas sizes compared with their randomized counterparts .",
    "the last two types of networks ( the electric circuits and the uscorp network ) which are constructed or evolve possibly following an intrinsic design principle , show quite small difference of the scc sizes and the fas sizes with those of their randomized counterparts .    from the above results , we can draw a rather crude conclusion that : the real world networks evolved from biological functions or social interactions ( except the metabolic networks ) , typically have smaller scc sizes and fas sizes than those in a randomized context",
    ", thus they are easier to be disrupted by the external perturbation or forces ; the metabolic networks , which show atypical behavior with many biological systems , have larger size of both scc and fas compared with the randomized counterparts , showing its stability against the external perturbations .",
