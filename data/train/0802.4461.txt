    "the magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) form a subclass of the cataclysmic variables stars consisting of a low - mass , late - type dwarf that fills its roche lobe and transfers mass to a magnetic white dwarf companion ( e.g. see warner 1995 , wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) . in the most strongly magnetic systems , the polars ( a.k.a .",
    "am  her stars ) , the white dwarf s magnetic field is sufficiently strong to lock it into synchronous rotation with the orbit and to inhibit the formation of an accretion disk , forcing the transferred gas to accrete onto one ( or sometimes both ) of the white dwarf s magnetic poles . in the intermediate polars ( ips , a.k.a .",
    "dq  her stars ) , the magnetic field strength is insufficient to phase lock the white dwarf , and accretion occurs onto both magnetic poles via a truncated accretion disk . in recent years , a third type of mcv has been recognized , the asynchronous polars , where the white dwarf rotates slightly ( @xmath6% ) out of synchronism with the orbit ( campbell & schwope 1999 ) . in all mcvs ,",
    "a high - temperature ( @xmath7  k ) shock is formed at the base of the accretion column , resulting in the emission of x - rays through bremsstrahlung radiation . at the relatively high magnetic field strengths typical of polar systems ( @xmath8  mg ) , a significant component of the cooling in the post - shock gas also occurs via polarized optical and infrared cyclotron radiation , which tends to lower the temperature of the post - schock gas and soften the x - ray spectrum ( lamb & masters 1979 ) . since the cyclotron radiation is beamed preferentially in directions perpendicular to the field lines , the changing aspect of the accretion column results in a significant modulation in the optical and infrared light curves at the orbital period of the binary .    a series of x - ray and optical spectroscopic observations reported in mukai et al . ( 2007 )",
    "have shown that the recently identified swift / bat source , swift  j2319.4 + 2619 , is likely to be a rare , hard - x - ray - emitting polar .",
    "the object was detected initially as a swift / bat source with a @xmath9  kev spectrum that could be fitted with either a power law of photon index 2.7 , or a bremsstrahlung spectrum ( kt=19 kev ) , with a @xmath10  kev flux of @xmath11  ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 .",
    "later , pointed swift / xrt observations obtained in may and june 2007 enabled mukai et al . to identify swift  j2319.4 + 2619 both with the rosat all - sky survey source 1rxs  j231930.9 + 261525 , and with a probable optical counterpart , usno  b1  1162 - 0585089 .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations then revealed strong balmer and he  ii emission lines typical of polars . in this paper we present time - resolved , multi - color , ccd photometry of the optical counterpart of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 , first reported in shafter et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which has enabled us to determine the likely orbital period of the system .",
    "we conclude by discussing the possibility that future observations may reveal swift  j2319.4 + 2619 to be a member of the class of asynchronous polars .",
    "a finding chart for the optical counterpart to swift  j2319.4 + 2619 is shown in figure  1 , with the coordinates taken from mukai et al .",
    "observations were carried out during five nights in december 2007 using the mount laguna observatory 1  m reflector .",
    "each night , a series of one minute exposures were taken through either a johnson - cousins @xmath14 filter ( see bessel 1990 ) , and imaged on a loral @xmath15 ccd . to decrease the read - out time between exposures , only a @xmath16 subsection of the full array",
    "was read out .",
    "the subsection was chosen to include swift  j2319.4 + 2619 and several relatively bright nearby field stars to be used for differential photometry .",
    "a summary of observations is presented in table  1 .",
    "the data were processed in a standard fashion ( bias subtraction and flat - fielding ) using iraf .",
    "the individual images were subsequently aligned to a common coordinate system and instrumental magnitudes for swift  j2319.4 + 2619 and a nearby comparison star were then determined using the _ iraf _ apphot package .",
    "variations in atmospheric transparency were removed to first order by dividing the flux of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 by that of a nearby comparison star located approximately @xmath17  w and @xmath18  s of the variable ( star  c \" in fig .",
    "the differential light curves were then placed on an absolute scale by calibrating the comparison star against standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) . for the comparison star , c ,",
    "we find @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the final calibrated light curves of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 are displayed in figure  2 .",
    "in polar systems a significant component of the optical radiation comes from cyclotron emission radiated from the accretion column . since the white dwarf s rotation ( and hence its magnetic axis ) is locked into synchronism with the orbit , polar systems show strong modulations in their optical radiation at the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the nature of the modulation depends largely on the system geometry ; specifically , the orientation of the magnetic axis relative to the spin axis , and the orientation of the orbital plane to our line of sight . in cases where the accreting column is visible throughout the orbit , the light curve is quasi - sinusoidal , with the observed modulation arising from the combined effects of cyclotron beaming and the changing orientation of the magnetic field axis to our line of sight .",
    "alternatively , if the accreting magnetic pole passes behind the limb of the white dwarf during part of the orbit , the light curve will be characterized by flat intervals ( during self eclipse of the accretion column ) followed by broad  humps \" when the column is visible .",
    "the former systems are often referred to as  one - pole \" systems because the accreting pole is the only pole ever visible , with the latter systems , which have the non - accreting pole visible during the part of the orbit when the accreting pole is hidden , referred to as  two - pole \" systems ( cropper 1990 ) .",
    "the photometry of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 shown in figure  2 clearly reveals a quasi - sinusoidal modulation with a time scale of @xmath13  hr , indicating that the object is a one - pole system . as expected for cyclotron emission in polars , the amplitude of the modulation increases with wavelength , in this case with values ranging from 0.8  mag in @xmath4 to 1.1  mag in @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "we determined the period of the modulation using two approaches .",
    "initially , we estimated times of maximum light from the point of intersection of straight line segments fitted by eye to the ascending and descending portions of the hump profiles . during the five nights of observation , we observed a total of eight maxima .",
    "the resulting timings , which we estimate to be accurate to @xmath23  min , are given in table  2 .",
    "a linear least - squares fit of these timings yields the following ephemeris for the times of maximum light in swift  j2319.4 + 2619 : @xmath24 residuals of the measured timings with respect to eqn  ( 1 ) are also included in table  2 .",
    "next , to make a more thorough period search , including possible alias periods , we analyzed the entire data set by computing a scargle ( 1982 ) periodogram .",
    "given that the light curves were obtained in different colors with differing amplitudes and zero - points , we converted all light curves to relative flux with maxima normalized to unity prior to computing the periodogram .",
    "the results of this analysis is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the 0.1254  d period determined above is clearly favored , however , it is not obvious that the one cycle per day aliases of this period ( 0.1114  d and 0.1435  d ) can be ruled out definitively .    in order to explore the viability of these alias periods ,",
    "we have performed two additional exercises .",
    "first , we have reproduced in figure  4 the light curves from the first three nights of observation , where we covered two maxima , showing the times of maxima expected for the best - fitting period and its one - day aliases .",
    "we have chosen to anchor the timings to the second maxima in each case because these maxima are the best defined ( most symmetrical ) .",
    "clearly , the shorter alias period ( @xmath25  d , dotted line ) appears to be too short to match the light curves , particularly in the case of the @xmath5-band light curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the longer alias period ( @xmath26  d , dashed line ) clearly appears to be too long in all cases .    as a final test",
    ", we have phased the light curves with each of the three periods , and plotted the normalized and phased light curves in figure  5 .",
    "the 0.1254  d period clearly produces the phased light curve with the least scatter , indicating that it provides the best fit to the data .",
    "taken together , the analyses presented above strongly favor the 0.1254  d period , and we adopt this as the likely orbital period of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 .",
    "swift  j2319.4 + 2619 is somewhat unusual ( for a polar ) given the strength of its _ hard _ x - ray emission .",
    "it has long been recognized that among mcvs , polars have relatively soft x - ray spectra compared with the ip systems ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 ; lamb 1985 ) .",
    "the ratio of hard - to - soft x - ray emission in a mcv depends strongly on the magnetic moment of the white dwarf .",
    "white dwarfs with high magnetic moments ( high fields and low masses ) are expected to have strong , soft x - ray emission , with low - field , high - mass systems expected to radiate significant hard x - ray emission ( e.g. see lamb & masters 1979 , cropper et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the dominant post - shock cooling mechanism in high - field systems , such as polars , is cyclotron emission , which tends to decrease the post - shock temperature and suppress hard x - ray emission , as would a lower mass white dwarf . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher temperatures required to produce the hard x - ray emission seen in ips can be produced in a lower - field system , which would be expected to cool primarily through bremsstrahlung radiation , or in a system with a high - mass white dwarf , or both . in a recent study of cataclysmic variables discovered in the integral / ibis survey , barlow et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that ip systems ( and the asynchronous polar systems ) were significantly more likely to be detected in the hard 20 - 100  kev energy band than were polar systems . in the sample of 19 cataclysmic variables discovered by ibis ,",
    "14 are known or suspected magnetic systems . of these , v834  cen is the only polar . among the rest , 11 are ips , two are asynchronous polars , and one is a bright ( and nearby ) dwarf nova ( ss cyg ) .",
    "the majority ( 13 ) of the 19 hard x - ray bright systems have known orbital periods , and all but one , the polar v834 cen , have periods in excess of the well - known @xmath27  hr gap in the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables .",
    "although it appears that the gap is less well defined for mcvs , it remains true that the ips typically have orbital periods above the gap , whereas polar systems are mostly concentrated at orbital periods below the gap ( e.g. webbink & wickramasinghe 2002 ) .",
    "the generally accepted explanation for this segregation is that the smaller binary dimensions and lower mass accretion rates characteristic of the short period systems make it easier for white dwarfs with a given magnetic moment to become locked in synchronism with the orbit ( e.g. king et al .",
    "patterson ( 1994 ) has estimated the minimum field strength necessary to phase lock a white dwarf of a given mass , @xmath28 , in a system with orbital period , @xmath29 , as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath32  g , @xmath28 is the white dwarf mass in solar units , and @xmath33  hr .    the orbital period of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 , as determined from the observed photometric modulation , places the system just above the @xmath27  hr period gap .",
    "the combination of the relatively long orbital period ( for a polar ) , coupled with the strong hard x - ray emission , suggests that it may be difficult to phase - lock the white dwarf in this system .",
    "in particular , as noted earlier the hard x - ray emission suggests either a low field strength , or high white dwarf mass , or both .",
    "however , as can be seen from eqn  ( 2 ) , these requirements make synchronism increasingly difficult to achieve at long orbital periods .      taken together , the observed properties of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 raise the possibility that the system may be a member of the ( rare ? ) class of asynchronous polars . in such systems ,",
    "of which there are currently only four known ( by  cam , v1500  cyg , v1432  aql , cd  ind ) , the white dwarf spin period and the orbital period differ by @xmath6% ( patterson et al .",
    "1995 , campbell & schowpe 1999 ) .",
    "the cause of the slight asynchronism in these systems is unknown , but may be caused by recent ( recorded or unrecorded ) nova eruptions ( v1500  cyg is a known nova , nova cyg 1975 ) , or , as suggested by patterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , by the difficulty in synchronizing white dwarfs at longer orbital periods ( among the four known asynchronous polars , all but cd  ind have orbital periods in excess of 3.3  hr ) .",
    "the latter explanation would seem to be relevant to by  cam and v1432  aql , where the orbital periods ( @xmath13.36  hr ) and estimated white dwarf masses ( @xmath11  m@xmath34 , ramsay 2000 ) suggest via eqn  ( 2 ) that @xmath35  mg would be required to synchronize the white dwarfs in these systems .",
    "although the field strength in v1432  aql is unknown , in by  cam it is estimated to be @xmath141  mg ( cropper et al .",
    "1989 ) , which would appear insufficient to assure synchronism of the white dwarf .",
    "it is possible that asynchronous polar systems may be considerably more common than is implied by the small number of systems currently known . in order to classify a mcv as an asynchronous polar",
    ", it is clearly necessary to establish the orbital period independently of any photometric ( or polarimetric ) modulation tied to the white dwarf rotation .",
    "the orbital periods in polars are difficult to measure directly unless the system is eclipsing . for non - eclipsing systems , such as swift  j2319.4",
    "+ 2619 , the orbital period can be measured directly only if spectral features from the secondary star are visible , and a radial velocity curve can be determined .",
    "future observations of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 , particularly if the system enters a low - state when the relative contribution of the secondary star s light to the overall system luminosity is increased , should focus on the detection of spectral features from the secondary star .",
    "for an orbital period of 3  hr , the secondary star is expected to have a spectral type of @xmath1m@xmath36 ( smith and dhillon 1998 ) , and would be most easily detected in the near infrared , for example through the na  i doublet at 8183 , 8194 .",
    "we have presented five nights of multicolor ccd photometry of the optical counterpart of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 , which has been recently identified as a hard - x - ray - emitting polar by mukai et al .",
    "our principal conclusions are as follows :    \\1 ) a strong , quasi - sinusoidal photometric modulation is seen in the light curve with a best - fitting period of 0.1254  d ( 3.01  hr ) , which we identify as the likely orbital period of the system .",
    "a detailed analysis of the data appears to rule out the one - day aliases of this period at p=0.1114  d ( 2.67  hr ) and p=0.1435  d ( 3.44  hr ) as viable orbital period candidates .",
    "\\2 ) the sinusoidal nature of the modulation suggests that swift  j2319.4 + 2619 is a ",
    "one - pole \" accretor , however a determination of the detailed accretion geometry and magnetic field strength will require future time - resolved polarimetric observations .",
    "\\3 ) the amplitude of the modulation ranges from @xmath10.8  mag in @xmath4 to @xmath11.1  mag in the @xmath5 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "the slight increase in the amplitude of the modulation with wavelength is characteristic of the cyclotron emission produced at typical polar field strengths , providing additional support for the identification of swift  j2319.4 + 2619 as a polar system .",
