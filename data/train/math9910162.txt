    "in 1974 , paul eklof @xcite used infinitary logic to generalize some classical theorems of infinite abelian group theory .",
    "he characterized the strongly @xmath3-free groups as exactly those abelian groups which are @xmath0-equivalent to free abelian groups , used his criterion to deduce that the class of free abelian groups is not @xmath0-definable , and showed that the baer - specker group @xmath2 is not @xmath0-equivalent to a free abelian group , strengthening a theorem of baer @xcite that @xmath2 is not free .",
    "this paper continues in the tradition allying infinite abelian group theory with infinitary logic .",
    "its main result is the following :    [ 0.1 ] the class * sl * of slender abelian groups is axiomatizable in the infinitary logic @xmath0 .",
    "[ 0.2 ] the baer - specker group @xmath2 is not @xmath0-equivalent to a slender group .",
    "corollary [ 0.2 ] improves further the above - mentioned results of baer @xcite and eklof @xcite .",
    "theorem [ 0.1 ] contrasts strikingly with another of eklof s corollaries that the class of free groups is not @xmath0-definable .",
    "the proof of theorem [ 0.1 ] also yields that the class of cotorsion - free abelian groups is @xmath1-definable .",
    "it is a tacit assumption of the present paper that all the groups are abelian .",
    "any undefined group - theoretical concepts can be found in fuchs @xcite and eklof and mekler @xcite ; for logical concepts , see barwise @xcite and dickmann @xcite .",
    "we recall just the essentials and the notation required to read the paper .",
    "the _ baer - specker group _",
    "@xmath2 is the product of countably many copies of @xmath4 ( the integers ) .",
    "recall that a torsion - free group @xmath5 is _ slender _ if whenever @xmath6 is a homomorphism , then @xmath7 for all but finitely many @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the standard @xmath10-th unit vector @xmath11 .",
    "we shall use * sl * to denote the class of slender groups .",
    "since the proof of theorem [ 0.1 ] uses nothing group - theoretical beyond nunke s criterion , stated as theorem [ 1.1 ] , the reader wishing to have a self - contained proof may take theorem [ 1.1](b ) as an equivalent definition of slenderness .",
    "examples of slender groups are @xmath4 , and the free groups , since if @xmath12 is a family of slender groups , then the direct sum @xmath13 is slender",
    ". subgroups of slender groups are slender .",
    "strongly @xmath3-free groups are slender , and hence so are the @xmath14-free groups .",
    "we use @xmath15 to denote the vocabulary of groups : @xmath15 contains a binary function symbol @xmath16 and a constant * o*. for infinite cardinals @xmath17 , the infinitary language ( or logic ) @xmath18 is defined to be the smallest collection of formulas containing the atomic @xmath15-formulas and closed under negation , conjunctions ( disjunctions ) of sets @xmath19 of formulas , and existential ( universal ) quantifier strings of length less than @xmath20 . the language @xmath21 is the union of the languages @xmath18 as @xmath22 ranges over the class of infinite cardinals .",
    "we write @xmath23 for groups",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 , to mean that for every @xmath18-sentence @xmath26 holds in @xmath24 iff @xmath27 holds in @xmath25 , and in this case , we say that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath18-equivalent .",
    "there is a well - known algebraic characterization of @xmath18-equivalence using systems of partial isomorphisms ( see the references @xcite or @xcite for details ) .",
    "a class * c * of groups is @xmath21-definable ( or @xmath21-axiomatizable ) if for some @xmath21-sentence @xmath27 , for every group @xmath28 iff @xmath27 holds in @xmath5 .",
    "many applications of infinitary logic to the study of infinite abelian groups are described in sections 4 , 5 and 7 of the survey @xcite ; the paper @xcite contains further results and bibliographical references .",
    "group - theoretical interest in @xmath0-axiomatizability stems also in part from a general thesis of classification theory that measures the complexity of a complete system of invariants for isomorphism for a class of abelian groups in terms of whether these invariants can be described by @xmath0-sentences ( @xcite , p.292 ; @xcite ) . by corollary 1.9 of @xcite",
    ", there is a group @xmath29 of cardinality @xmath3 which is @xmath0-equivalent , but not isomorphic , to the free group @xmath30 of cardinality @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath30 is slender , it follows that @xmath29 is also slender . in the framework of classification theory ,",
    "the results of this paper establish that the first - order theory of the class * sl * does not have a good structure theorem , since the possible invariants distinguishing the slender groups @xmath30 and @xmath29 can not have a simple definition .",
    "for the same reason , the first - order theory of the cotorsion - free groups has no good structure theorem either .",
    "finally , let us explain why theorem [ 0.1 ] is the best possible , i.e. why the language @xmath0 is the right one for axiomatizing * sl*. note first that * sl * is not first - order definable , since if @xmath31 is any non - principal ultrafilter over @xmath32 , then the ultrapower @xmath33 is not slender , but , by @xmath34o lemma , @xmath35 , and @xmath4 is slender .",
    "so * sl * is not @xmath36-definable . nor is * sl * @xmath1-definable : barwise @xcite shows that @xmath37 , and again @xmath38 , being free , is slender . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy to see that for every cardinal @xmath22 greater than the continuum , the class * sl * is @xmath39-definable .",
    "so the question of real interest is whether * sl * is @xmath39-definable for @xmath40 .",
    "theorem [ 0.1 ] and corollary [ 0.2 ] answer this question in the strongest possible form .",
    "all our results are theorems of zfc ( ordinary set theory ) , and this emphasizes the profound difference , as far as axiomatizability goes , between the classes of slender ( and cotorsion - free ) groups on the one hand , and the free groups on the other .",
    "the key algebraic component in the proof of theorem [ 0.1 ] is the following well - known characterization of the slender groups , due to nunke @xcite ( or see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "[ 1.1 ]    for an abelian group @xmath5 , the following conditions are equivalent :    * @xmath5 is slender ; * @xmath5 does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to any of the following groups : @xmath41 ( the rationals under addition ) , @xmath42 ( the cyclic group of order @xmath43 ) or @xmath44 ( the @xmath43-adic integers ) for any prime @xmath43",
    ".    it will be convenient to split the proof of theorem [ 0.1 ] into some facts and propositions which will all have the general form : for each group @xmath25 in theorem [ 1.1](b ) there is a sentence @xmath27 such that for every torsion - free group @xmath45 is true in @xmath5 iff @xmath5 has a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath25 .",

    "a similar argument using the appropriate conjunct of ( d ) in @xmath83 proves that @xmath94 is one - to - one .    the cases @xmath99 are trivial .",
