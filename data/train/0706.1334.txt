    "the standard scenario for the structure formation is that the primordial density fluctuation grows through its gravitational instability @xcite . even though the perturbative descriptions are possible when the density fluctuation is small enough , in order to follow the distribution far into the nonlinear region , we must , inevitably , rely on the numerical calculations , named , @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .    for @xmath0-body simulations ,",
    "there is a problem about how to set up the initial conditions .",
    "even though the naive expectation is that it is better to start simulations as early as possible , like recombination era , it is well known that this is extremely difficult numerically .",
    "when we start @xmath0-body simulations at an early era , the initial condition can be overwhelmed by sources of noise , such as the numerical roundoff error or the shot noise of the particles .",
    "therefore , in the standard scheme  @xcite , we must use the perturbative approach . until the fluctuations come into the quasi - nonlinear regime and stable numerical calculation become possible .",
    "even though there has been much progress about @xmath0-body code with how to solve the non - linear structure in the universe , the method to set up the initial conditions into these codes has been almost the same from the first works of this field @xcite . in many cases , the zeldovich approximation ( za ) @xcite , i.e.",

    "even though the za describe the growth of the density fluctuation much better than the eulerian linear theory , it does not reproduce the higher order statistics , like skewness and kurtosis with very poor accuracy @xcite , because the acceleration is always parallel to the peculiar velocity .",
    "in other words , the acceleration does not reflect the exact clustering in the za .    therefore",

    "basically , their initial conditions are based on the approximations valid up to second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) which reproduce exact value of the skewness in the weakly nonlinear region  @xcite . with these initial conditions ,",
    "they calculate the statistical quantities and show the effects of transients related with 2lpt initial conditions decrease much faster than the ones related with za initial conditions , that is , the transients with 2lpt initial conditions are less harmful than ones with za initial conditions .",
    "however , there still exist transients related with 2lpt initial conditions which prevent to reproduce the exact value of higher order statistical quantities like the kurtosis , and there is no guarantee that 2lpt initial conditions are accurate enough for these quantities .",
    "therefore , as a natural extension of @xcite , we examine the impact of transients from initial conditions based on 2lpt in @xmath0-body simulation . in this paper ,",
    "in addition to the za and 2lpt , we also calculate the non - gaussianity with the initial conditions based on third - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 3lpt ) which reproduce exact value of the kurtosis in the weakly nonlinear region @xcite .",

    "in this section , we briefly summarize lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) and obtain the approximations valid up to the third - order .",
    "we also point out explicitly why transients appear in the perturbative approach .    before considering the perturbation , we present the background cosmic expansion which determines the motion of cosmic fluid in newtonian cosmology .",
    "we consider @xmath3cdm model in which the friedmann equations are given as @xmath4 with a background density @xmath5 of pressureless fluid and a cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "even though we take account of @xmath3 for the numerical calculations , we sometimes consider the case with @xmath6 , so - called einstein - de sitter ( e - ds ) model , for a concrete solution in this section and the next section .",
    "this can be justified since the effect of @xmath3 is negligible at the time we set initial conditions for cosmological @xmath0- body simulations . for simplicity , in this paper",
    ", we do not consider back - reaction from the motion of the matter to cosmic expansion .",
    "next , we consider the perturbations . in this paper , we consider the lagrangian perturbation in which solutions for cosmic fluid are already derived by several people @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , it is necessary to define the comoving lagrangian coordinates @xmath7 in terms of the comoving eulerian coordinates @xmath8 as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the displacement vector which denotes the deviation from the homogeneous distribution .",

    "( [ eqn : l - exactrho ] ) , we can see that the break down of the perturbation with respect to @xmath11 does not necessarily mean that to @xmath10 , which is the strong reason for considering the lagrangian picture .",
    "in other words , although the density diverges or the fluid forms zeldovich pancake , the perturbation does not diverge .    from the physical property ,",
    "@xmath10 can be decomposed to the longitudinal and the transverse modes : @xmath15 where @xmath16 means the lagrangian spatial derivative .    in this paper ,",
    "since it is well known that the transverse mode is negligible for pressureless fluid , we consider only longitudinal mode . from kelvin circulation theorem , this is quite natural if it is generated only by the action of gravity .",
    "for the discussions with the transverse mode in lpt , see  @xcite .",
    "hereafter we mainly follow the description by catelan  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider the perturbations in einstein - de sitter universe . in the lagrangian description , changing the temporal variable as @xmath17 , the basic equation for the density contrast for the pressureless fluid named lagrangian poisson equation is given by @xmath18 \\ddot{s}_{\\beta \\alpha } = \\alpha ( \\tau )   \\left [ j(\\bm{q } , \\tau ) -1\\right]\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{exact_lag_pois}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the deformation tensor , @xmath20 is the cofactor matrix of @xmath21 .",

    "since we consider only the longitudinal modes , the perturbative solutions are described with gradient of scalar functions , @xmath28 for the pressureless fluid , it can be shown that the perturbative solutions are separable into the temporal and the spatial parts , @xmath29 the dynamics of the evolution constrains in general both the temporal dependence as described by the functions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the spatial displacements @xmath34 .",
    "first we derive the lagrangian linear perturbative solution ( za ) . making use of the fact that up to the third - order , the following expression for the jacobian determinant @xmath13 holds  @xcite : @xmath35 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\nabla_q \\cdot   \\bm{s}^{(3 ) } +   \\left[(\\nabla_q \\cdot \\bm{s}^{(1 ) } ) ( \\nabla_q \\cdot \\bm{s}^{(2 ) } )   - s_{\\alpha \\beta } ^{(1 ) } s_{\\beta\\alpha } ^{(2)}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\det ( s_{\\alpha \\beta } ^{(1)})\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "clearly , by regarding the top - hat spherical collapse considered in this section as the generation of the overdense regions through gravitational instability in the universe , this analysis provides another explanation for the results in the previous section .",
    "for example , for the initial condition @xmath105 , the effect of 3lpt has become significant , while for @xmath106 and @xmath107 it is only below @xmath108 and eventually negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of 2lpt is still significant even we choose the initial condition with smaller density fluctuation like @xmath107 .",
    "recently , observations have improved the precision of cosmological constraints tremendously . in order to compare theoretical predictions with observational results , we should carry out detailed numerical simulations with high accuracy . in this context , in order to follow the nonlinear evolution , one needs to consider carefully how to set initial conditions of @xmath0-body simulations very carefully . in the standard method ,",
    "the initial conditions are set up by the zeldovich approximation ( za ) in the quasi - nonlinear regime .",
    "the za has the nice property that by using linear perturbation theory allows one to describe accurately the quasi - nonlinear density field , in the case of small non - linearity .    on the other hand ,",
    "when constraining cosmological models , non - gaussianity of the density fluctuations generated by the nonlinear dynamics will become important .",
    "it is well known that the za is not sufficient to measure non - gaussianity from higher - order statistics , for example , the skewness and kurtosis .",

    "they show that even though there are also transients from 2lpt initial conditions , the effects of transients are suppressed compared to the za case .    in this paper , as a natural extension of @xcite , in addition to the za and 2lpt , we also analyze the non - gaussianity with the initial conditions based on third - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 3lpt ) .",
    "since 3lpt initial conditions are expected to provide exact results for the kurtosis in the weakly nonlinear region , we can evaluate the impact of transients from 2lpt initial conditions .",
    "the goal is to clarify the range where @xmath0-body simulations from 2lpt initial conditions are accurate .    when we set the initial condition of the maximal density contrast reaching unity @xmath109 at @xmath110 , differences in the predicted non - gaussianity between the three different initial conditions ( za , 2lpt and 3lpt ) are readily apparent .",
    "since the accurate value of the skewness is reproduced by 2lpt for the weakly nonlinear regime , this disagreement is because of the nonlinearity at this initial time . therefore , 2lpt initial conditions are not sufficient to set up the initial condition for @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "there is also no guarantee that 3lpt initial conditions are accurate enough for precise determination of cosmological parameters .",

    "the difference of non - gaussianity with initial conditions based on the za and 3lpt is large ( @xmath114 for the skewness and @xmath115 for the kurtosis ) until @xmath116 .",

    "this tendency is also obtained for the initial conditions set at @xmath117 when the maximal density contrast is about two - tenths , @xmath118 . from the numerical calculations for the kurtosis",
    ", we can see that the effects of transients from 2lpt initial condition have completely disappeared until @xmath119 . however , there is still significant differences in the predicted non - gaussianity with initial conditions based on the za and 3lpt ( @xmath120 for the skewness and @xmath121 for the kurtosis ) until @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently early @xmath122 initial conditions , the effects of transients on kurtosis from 2lpt initial conditions become negligible until roughly @xmath123 , while those from the za initial conditions survive until @xmath116 . as long as one considers typical @xmath0-body simulations , which start at @xmath124 , the predicted statistics are accurate enough up to the forth - order ( kurtosis ) using 2lpt initial conditions .",
    "we further investigated our above results semi - analytically by considering the simpler situation modeled by a top - hat spherically symmetric collapse with constant density .",
    "we can show that in this situation , the difference between the impact of 2lpt and 3lpt initial conditions becomes almost negligible for the initial maximum density contrast much less than the half ( @xmath125 ) , while the difference between the impact of the za and 2lpt initial conditions is still greater than @xmath113 for the initial maximum density contrast about two - tenth ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "finally , we briefly mention the observational consequences of our results .",
    "it is known that weak lensing surveys can potentially provide us with precision maps of the projected density up to redshifts around 1 @xcite .",

    "<S> unless these transients are completely suppressed compared with the dominant growing mode , we can not reproduce the correct evolution of cumulants with orders higher than two , even though there is no problem with the numerical scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the impact of transients on the observable statistical quantities by performing @xmath0-body simulations with initial conditions based on lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the effects of transients on the kurtosis from the initial conditions , based on second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) have almost disappeared by @xmath1 , as long as the initial conditions are set at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for practical purposes , the initial conditions based on 2lpt are accurate enough for numerical calculations of skewness and kurtosis . </S>"
