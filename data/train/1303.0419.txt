    "consider motion of three tracer particles floating on the surface of a fluid which exhibits a complex flow @xcite .",
    "the three points form a triangle whose shape is specified by two angles , and is therefore specified by a point in a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "it is of interest to consider the evolution of the shape of this triangle , independent of its scale , rotation and translation of its origin , because this is a means to characterise the essential geometry of the flow .",
    "early investigations of random shapes were mathematical @xcite , and originally motivated by discerning whether nearly co - linear arrangements of archelogical features occured by chance or by design @xcite . in the context of fluid turbulence ,",
    "models for the evolution of shapes of triangles and tetrahedra have been extensively studied in the past decade in the fluid literature : see @xcite .",
    "our objective here is to define and analyse the motion of triplets of points in a simple model of turbulent flows .",
    "we obtain an exact expression for the steady - state statistics of the triangle shapes .",
    "our model flow is motivated by considering a scale decomposition of turbulent velocity fields .",
    "the flow at scales much larger than the size of the triangle merely translates and rotates the three points of the triangle , without any shape modification .",
    "structures existing at a scale comparable to triangle size are modelled by applying a random matrix of unit determinant , to respect the incompressibility constraint .",
    "we refer to this motion as random strain ( although the motion involves both strain and vorticity ) .",
    "lastly , there may also be small - scale components in the flow which result in apparently uncorrelated motion of particles .",
    "we solve a model incorpoarating these effects , which is a simplification of a model introduced in @xcite .",
    "specifically , it is assumed that the particles evolve under the combined influence of a random strain ( delta - correlated in time ) and of independent brownian motions .",
    "because the displacement caused by a uniform strain is proportional to the scale size of the triangle , the strain will become dominant in the long - time limit as the separation of the particles grows .",
    "we therefore analyse a model where the brownian displacement scales with the radius of gyration of the triangle .",
    "that is , we analyse a model for the small displacements @xmath0 of three particles with positions @xmath1 which has the following structure : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a traceless random symmetric matrix with diffusive fluctuations , @xmath4 is a brownian displacement , and @xmath5 is the radius of gyration , defined by @xmath6 the stochastic incrememts @xmath3 and @xmath0 in equation ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) are both multiplied by terms which depend upon the coordinates @xmath1 .",
    "this implies a potential source of ambiguity about whether the increment @xmath0 at each time step should be evaluated using the it or the stratonovich rule @xcite . we will show that this ambiguity only affects the way the size of the triangle grows in time . when considering the evolution of the shape of the triangle",
    ", we do not need to distinguish whether the stochastic increments are of it or stratonovich type .    in this article , we begin by investigating separately the action of the strain and of the brownian terms .",
    "we then consider the two terms together , and find an exact expression for the distribution of the shapes of the triangles which are generated by this random process .",
    "specifying the shape of a triangle requires two parameters , which could be two of the three angles . for our purposes , however , another parametrisation is much more useful .",
    "kendall argued that it is natural to describe the shape of a triangle by a point on the surface of a sphere @xcite , which we will refer to as the kendall sphere .",
    "his paper also states that if the vertices of a triangle execute independent brownian motions , then the image of this process is uniform diffusion on the surface of the kendall sphere . his original paper @xcite does not give a derivation of this result , and derivations which we have seen in later works rely upon computer algebra packages @xcite or upon quite abstract machinery @xcite . in section [ sec : 1 ] we start by explaining the kendall sphere , its relation to other parametrisations , and we describe a langevin equation which will prove to be a convenient representation of diffusion on the surface of a sphere . in section [ sec : 3 ] we define the ensemble of random strain @xmath3 introduced in ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) , and evaluate the image of this random strain process on the surface of the kendall sphere .",
    "we show that this leads to a diffusion process which is axially symmetric on the sphere . in section [ sec : 2 ] we use the same framework to give a direct demonstration of kendall s result that the image of brownian motion of the three points in cartesian space is unbiased , isotropic and homogeneous diffusion on the kendall sphere .    in section [ sec : 4 ]",
    "we combine the results of sections [ sec : 3 ] and [ sec : 2 ] to determine a fokker - planck equation which determines the probability density for the model ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) on the kendall sphere .",
    "we solve this equation for the steady - state shape distribution .",
    "the analysis in sections [ sec : 3]-[sec : 4 ] is uses the strategy of determining stochastic increments of polar coordinates on the kendal sphere , and using these to surmise the fokker - planck equation .",
    "a complementary approach is to develop a fokker - planck equation for the model ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) directly , and make a change of variable .",
    "this approach is explored in section [ sec : 5 ] , where we also show how the fokker - planck operator can be expressed as a linear combination of casimir operators .",
    "last , we briefly summarize our results in section [ sec : 6 ] .",
    "consider a triangle in the plane formed by three points @xmath1 , @xmath7 .",
    "the shape of the triangle is described by two two - component vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 and by a @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the cartesian components of @xmath16 .",
    "it is natural to represent the matrix @xmath11 by a singular - value decomposition , writing @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the matrix describing a rotation by an angle @xmath19 : @xmath20 note that the angle @xmath21 in ( [ eq : 1.3 ] ) describes an overal rotation of the triangle , and is irrelevant to describing its shape . the radius of gyration @xmath5 of the triangle may be expressed in terms of the singular values @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the centre of mass of the three points .",
    "the area of the triangle is simply expressed in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 as : @xmath26 we note that the size of the triangle can be characterized either by @xmath5 or by @xmath27 .",
    "using @xmath27 is natural when considering area - preserving dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , because the parametrization involving @xmath27 has a singularity when the three points defining the triangle become co - linear , it is more natural to use @xmath5 instead of @xmath27 when the dynamics allows the vertices to become co - linear .",
    "for this reason we prefer @xmath5 over @xmath27 as the scale coordinate throughout most of this paper .",
    "the angle @xmath28 characterizes the rotation in the space of triangles with a given set of values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we note that a cyclic permutation of the vertices @xmath1 , @xmath29 ( respectively @xmath30 ) amounts to a transformation @xmath31 ( respectively @xmath32 ) .",
    "the shape of the triangle may be specified by the variables @xmath28 and @xmath33 instead of by two angles .",
    "it is useful to consider the form of the matrix @xmath34 : @xmath35 so that the geometrical properties of the vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 have period @xmath36 in the angle @xmath28 .",
    "it is convenient to transform the ratio @xmath37 into another variable , @xmath38 , defined by @xmath39 note that the variable @xmath38 , denoted @xmath40 in @xcite , satisfies @xmath41 , so that a point the region @xmath42 , @xmath43 uniquely defines the shape of a triangle .",
    "the points @xmath44 correspond to equilateral triangles , with their shape being independent of the angular coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "we can therefore regard the space of triangles as being equivalent to the surface of a sphere with azimuthal angle @xmath28 , and with polar angle @xmath19 , related to @xmath38 by @xmath45 .",
    "the equator corresponds to degenerate triangles consisting of three colinear points .",
    "the poles are equilateral triangles",
    ". there are three singular points on the equator , at which two points of the co - linear denerate triangle coincide .",
    "this device of representing the shape of a triangle by a point on the surface of a sphere was first introduced by d. g. kendall @xcite",
    ". we will refer to it as the kendall sphere .",
    "in the case where a triangle is subjected to a sequence of uncorrelated infinitesimal perturbations , the representative point diffuses over the surface of the sphere .",
    "we will characterise this diffusion process by specifying the stochastic increments @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath28 .",
    "in general the diffusion process may be inhomogeneous , it may have an anisotropic diffusion coefficient , and it may have drift terms . as a reference model ,",
    "let us consider the case of homogeneous and isotropic diffusion on the kendall sphere , with diffusion coefficient @xmath48 .",
    "we characterise this process in terms of the stochastic increments of @xmath38 and @xmath28 .    to characterise this homogeneous diffusive evolution let us use a system of standard cartesian coordinates : @xmath49 .",
    "without loss of generality we can use invariance with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath28 , and consider a point where @xmath50 . consider an orthogonal basis defined at the point @xmath51 : @xmath52 the diffusive fluctuation of a point @xmath53 on the surface is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are angular increments",
    ", satisfying @xmath57 and @xmath58 the value of @xmath59 is determined from @xmath55 and @xmath56 using the constraint that @xmath60 remains normalised : this implies that @xmath61 .",
    "consider the increments of @xmath38 and @xmath28 under this process : we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "solving for @xmath47 , @xmath46 , we find @xmath64 where @xmath45 , @xmath65 .",
    "the diffusion and drift coefficients for homogeneous diffusion on the sphere are defined by writing @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , are therefore @xmath69 this representation of homogeneous , isotropic diffusion on the surface of a sphere will prove to be an instructive comparison case for the random strain model which we consider next .",
    "here we consider the dynamics of the three verices @xmath70 of the triangle under the action of a matrix @xmath71 which satisfies @xmath72 . we shall describe the shape of a triangle by the matrix used to obtain it by deformation of an equilateral triangle . call this matrix @xmath71 .",
    "we consider area - preserving flows , so that we require @xmath72 . the equilateral triangle ( with unit radius of gyration )",
    "is described by @xmath73 a general triangle is described by @xmath74 we use a singular - value decomposition representation of @xmath71 : @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the strain term , introduced in ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) , acts multiplicatively on the variables defining the shape @xmath71 , in the form : @xmath77 where @xmath3 is an infinitesimal random strain , of the form @xmath78 the statistics of the elements of the random strain are @xmath79 and @xmath80 imposing the reqirement that the statistics of this random strain matrix are rotationally invariant leads to the condition @xmath81 .",
    "an infinitesimal rotation could have been included in the definition of the random strain ( by making the off - diagonal elements dissimilar ) , but this in clearly irrelevant to shape fluctuations .    because the noise term @xmath3 acts multiplicatively on the matrix @xmath71 defining the shape of the triangle , the precise definition of @xmath82 matters when practically integrating the equations . the simplest procedure consisting in taking @xmath83 ( the it procedure ) , and the physically more correct procedure , consisting in defining : @xmath84 ( the stratonovich procedure ) @xcite differ by a diagonal term , @xmath85 , which dilates in a similar way the two eigenvalues @xmath22 and @xmath23 , thus leaving the variables that characterize the shape , @xmath38 and @xmath28 , unaffected .",
    "for this reason , the precise way of defining the model here turns out to be immaterial .",
    "consider the evolution of the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath86 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 under this random strain evolution : from ( [ eq : 3.4 ] ) we obtain @xmath87 where @xmath88 in the following we use the rotational invariance of the statistics of @xmath3 to conclude that the statistics of its elements satisfy @xmath89 .",
    "expanding the factors of equation ( [ eq : 3.7 ] ) up to quadratic terms in the small increments @xmath90 , @xmath47 and @xmath91 , and collecting terms , we find @xmath92 the first order relations between the increments @xmath93 , @xmath94 and the increments of the shape parameters are therefore @xmath95 so that @xmath96 adding the corrections arising from the quadratic terms then gives @xmath97 the first two of these relations are consistent with the constraint @xmath98 , and the second pair follow from @xmath99 .",
    "now transform to new variables @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "it is clear that the evolution is scale invariant , so that the dynamics does not depend upon the radius of gyration @xmath5 .",
    "we find @xmath102 the increment of @xmath28 is @xmath103 the drift and diffusion coefficients in the @xmath37 , @xmath28 variables are : @xmath104 now work in terms of @xmath105 : the diffusion and drift coefficients are @xmath106 to express these in terms of @xmath38 , consider an intermediate variable @xmath107 , satisfying @xmath108 then : @xmath109 and @xmath110 finally @xmath111 it is interesting to note that the coefficients differ from those of the homogeneous diffusion on a sphere ( considered in section [ sec : 1 ] ) by a simple factor , namely @xmath112 .",
    "in the introduction we mentioned that if the vertices execute independent brownian motion , then the dynamics of the representative point on the surface of the kendall sphere is homogeneous diffusion .",
    "the published derivations @xcite are difficult to compare with the derivation of the diffusion process for the random strain model which we analysed in section [ sec : 3 ] . in this section",
    "we present an elementary derivation of kendall s result , using the same approach as for the random strain model .",
    "let the vertices of a triangle make small , independent and isotropic diffusive displacements , as if they are undergoing brownian motion .",
    "the vectors @xmath16 undergo displacements with components @xmath113 the statistics of these small displacements satisfy @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a diffusion coefficient .",
    "note that @xmath116 for any choice of @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , so that @xmath115 is the same as the diffusion coefficient for the brownian motion in coordinate space .",
    "we can characterise the change in the triangle by considering a change matrix @xmath11 and hence the changes in the variables @xmath28 and @xmath38 . applying rotation matrices to @xmath121",
    ", we obtain @xmath122 the elements of @xmath123 are independent of @xmath86 and @xmath28 : for example @xmath124 has a variance @xmath125 which is independent of @xmath28 and @xmath86 , and the same is true of the other components of @xmath126 . because of this invariance it suffices to perform perturbation theory about the @xmath127 , @xmath128 case : @xmath129 where the @xmath130 are components of @xmath131 in the rotated coordinate system . expanding in powers of @xmath132 and @xmath90 , and retaining terms only up",
    "to quadratic order in the small increments , we find @xmath133 these equations can be solved to determine @xmath91 , @xmath134 and @xmath90 in terms of the elements of @xmath123 .",
    "we follow the same approach as in section [ sec : 3 ] .",
    "first , compute the linear terms from the linear terms of ( [ eq : 2.7 ] ) .",
    "we then use these expressions to estimate the covariances of the small increments @xmath47 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we find that the stochastic increments are @xmath135 from now on we concentrate upon the evolution of the coordinates which define the shape : these can be taken to be @xmath28 and @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath136 now normalise the scale of the triangle so that the radius of gyration @xmath137 is factored out of the stochastic increments : @xmath138 \\nonumber \\\\ % & = & \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\delta u'_1}{\\lambda_2 r}-\\frac{\\lambda}{r}\\frac{\\delta v'_2}{\\lambda_2 r } + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{2\\lambda(\\lambda^2 + 1)^2 d_b   \\delta t}{\\lambda^2 - 1 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider the evolution of the shape of the triangle with the radius of gyration frozen .",
    "when the radius of gyration is @xmath139 , the increment of @xmath37 may therefore be written @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a stochastic increment which satisfies @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "similarly , the increment of @xmath28 may be expressed as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a stochastic increment with the same statistics as @xmath146 , that is @xmath147 .",
    "the shape fluctuations are described by fluctuations of just two variables , @xmath28 and @xmath37 , which evolve diffusively .",
    "their coefficients of diffusion and drift are independent of @xmath28 : @xmath148 an alternative coordinate is @xmath105 . expressing the stochastic increments in the @xmath149 coordinate system , we obtain the following expressions for the diffusion and drift coefficients : @xmath150 again following the approach in section [ sec : 3 ] , we express the diffusion and drift coefficients in terms of @xmath38 by introducing a variable @xmath107 defined by @xmath151 , so that @xmath152 . now express the coefficients in terms of @xmath38 , and obtain @xmath153 these are the same as for simple diffusion on a sphere , as discussed in section [ sec : 1 ] , with the diffusion coefficient @xmath115 replaced by @xmath154 .",
    "these coefficients are also very closely related to those obtained in the random strain model : the coefficients for that model all differ by a factor of @xmath155 .",
    "consider the distribution of triangle shapes for a mixed model , in which the displacement of the three particles in a short time interval @xmath156 is a combination of a random strain and an uncorrelated random displacement , which is proportional to the radius of gyration @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to the following map , using the notation of ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) : @xmath157 describing the evolution of the shape of the triangle , from @xmath158 to @xmath159 in a time @xmath156 .",
    "the statistics of the elements of @xmath3 are given by ( [ eq : 3.6 ] ) , and @xmath4 has a gaussian distribution , characterized by @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the diffusion coefficient associated with brownian motion .",
    "the scaling of the brownian component in ( [ eq : 4.1 ] ) implies that the increments of @xmath37 and @xmath28 due to the brownian motion are given by equations ( [ eq : 2.14 ] ) and ( [ eq : 2.16 ] ) , alternatively by stochastic incremenets @xmath46 , @xmath47 which can be expressed using the drift and diffusion coefficients ( [ eq : 2.23 ] ) .",
    "similarly , there are independent contributions to @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the shearing motion .",
    "these are described by stochastic increments with drift and diffusion coefficients given by equations ( [ eq : 3.19 ] ) , ( [ eq : 3.20 ] ) and ( [ eq : 3.21 ] ) .",
    "the stochastic terms @xmath163 and @xmath4 in ( [ eq : 4.1 ] ) both act multiplicatively , either on the variables @xmath1 , or upon the radius of gyration @xmath5 , which is a function of these variables . this could potentially result in an ambiguity in defining the model @xcite , depending upon whether we use the it or stratonovich definition of the stochastic increment .",
    "we notice in this respect the ambiguity in the evolution defined by the brownian term only affects the radial variable @xmath5 , and not the shape variable . as pointed out in section [ sec : 2 ] , the same is true for the shear term .",
    "the fluctuations of shape are therefore described by a fokker - planck equation for the joint probability density on the kendal sphere , @xmath164 @xmath165 + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\left[d_z(z)p\\right]+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2 } \\left[d_\\phi(z)p\\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath166 the steady state solution only depends upon the ratio of diffusion coefficients @xmath167 this has a steady state solution where @xmath28 is uniform on the circle and where the marginal distribution for @xmath38 satisfies @xmath168=0\\ ] ] so that @xmath169 this has a solution @xmath170 where the multiplier normalises @xmath171 on @xmath172 $ ] .    to check the prediction of ( [ eq : 4.6 ] )",
    ", we have studied numerically the mixed model defined by ( [ eq : 4.1 ] ) .",
    "one of the crucial properties of the random strain is that it conserves exactly the area of the triangle : @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is introduced in ( [ eq : 3.2],[eq : 3.3 ] ) .",
    "we stress that the constraint @xmath173 is satisfied only when the evolution equation ( [ eq : 4.1 ] ) is treated using the stratonovich formulation  @xcite .",
    "one readily notices that the expression for the evolution operator , induced by the strain , and correct up to order @xmath175 , is simply : @xmath176 which is the expansion of the exponential of the traceless matrix @xmath3 up to second order . to impose strictly the constraint of area conservation , we replaced the operator in ( [ eq : exp ] ) by @xmath177 , whose determinant is exactly equal to @xmath178 . and has the correct expansion , up to terms of order @xmath179 . using the fact that : @xmath180 , one readily finds that @xmath181 also , the brownian motion term acts in ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) multiplicatively ( because of @xmath5 ) .",
    "as we are interested here only in the shape evolution , and not on the evolution of the size , @xmath5 , which requires some care , we have projected the term @xmath182 term in the direction transverse to the radial direction , which does not affect the shape dynamics , but simplifies the numerical integration .",
    "the data shown in figure 1 was obtained by iterating the mapping given by ( [ eq : 4.1 ] ) for @xmath183 time steps , over @xmath184 different realisations .",
    "figure 1 shows our numerical results , which agree very well with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the derivation of the stationary shape distribution in sections [ sec : 2]-[sec : 4 ] proceeded by setting up langevin equations for the evolution of the variables @xmath38 and @xmath28 ( which label positions on the kendall sphere of triangle shapes ) .",
    "this langevin process was used to obtain a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation for @xmath38 , after first concluding that the probability density is uniform in @xmath28 .",
    "an alternative approach is to derive a fokker - planck equation for the distribution of all of the variables @xmath38 , @xmath28 , @xmath19 and @xmath5 which parametrise the relative disposition of three points in the plane , and to solve the resulting four - dimensional fokker - planck equation by separation of variables .",
    "this alternative method makes plain the invariance properties under the group of rotation , @xmath185 and the group of dilation , and in the case of the random strain model , under the group of unitary matrices , @xmath186 @xcite , at the cost of complicated algebraic manipulations , which we do not present in full detail here .",
    "these invariances are expressed via the introduction of the casimir operators , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 corresponding respectively to @xmath185 , @xmath186 and the group of dilation @xcite .",
    "consistent with the convention introduced in @xcite , we use for the purposes of this section the coordinate @xmath190 to characterise the size of the triangle , rather than the radius of gyration @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , triangles can be parametrized either by the set of coordinates @xmath191 coordinates , as in @xcite , or by the set of coordinates @xmath192 used so far .",
    "note that our notation differ from those of @xcite and @xcite , where the coordinates @xmath191 were denoted @xmath193 ( we changed the notation because it is conventional to use @xmath149 as the polar projection and azimuthal angle on a sphere ) .      here",
    "we consider how to describe the random strain process using a fokker - planck equation .",
    "we parametrize a triangle by the two vectors , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , introduced in equation ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) .",
    "these vectors are specified by four coordinates @xmath196 , and we start by describing the random strain process by a fokker - planck equation expressed in terms of these four variables . under the action of the random strain process , these vectors evolve according to @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a random @xmath10 matrix .",
    "the antisymmetric part of @xmath198 corresponds to an overall rotation .",
    "since we are interested only in the shape , we ignore the overall rotation and dilation , and consider only traceless symmetric matrices .    by integrating equation ( [ eq",
    ": 5.1 ] ) with respect to time and iterating the resulting equation , in the limit of small values of the time @xmath156 one obtains : @xmath199 ( here and in the remainder of this section summation is implied when indices are repeated ) . in equation ( [ eq : int_2 ] ) , the term written as a single integral has zero mean , and a variance growing like @xmath156 .",
    "it is therefore a diffusion term .",
    "the term written with a double integral has a mean of order @xmath156 ; it corresponds to the drift term .",
    "higher order terms are formally smaller order terms in @xmath156 . to make the connection with the formulation used in section [ sec : 3 ] , the stochastic increment in equations ( [ eq : 3.4 ] ) and ( [ eq : 3.5 ] ) may be written @xmath200 we assume that the coefficients of the matrix @xmath198 are @xmath201-correlated in time . using the constraint that @xmath202 is symmetric , traceless , and has rotationally invariant statistics , we find",

    "the use to the relation ( [ eq : int_2 ] ) for advancing the variables @xmath196 amounts to using the physically correct stratonovich procedure to integrate the stochastic model ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) .    from equation ( [ eq : int_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : variance_a ] ) one can easily determine the fokker - planck equation for the random - strain process : @xmath206 p \\bigr ) \\nonumber \\\\ %   & \\equiv &   - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_{a , i } } ( v_{a , i } p ) + \\frac { \\langle a^2 \\rangle}{2}\\hat l_d p \\label{eq : fp_incompl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 is the drift term velocity , obtained by taking the average of ( [ eq : 5.2 ] ) , and @xmath208 is a diffusion operator containing second derivatives . for the drift term",
    "we find @xmath209 the term representing the diffusion term in the fokker - planck operator has a more complex structure .",
