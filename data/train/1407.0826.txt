    "binary mixtures of atomic bose  einstein condensates ( becs ) have been the subject of intense research since the first experimental realisation with two sympathetically cooled hyperfine states of @xmath0rb  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the two species , driven by the nonlinear atomic interaction , gives insight into atomic physics @xcite , supports rich nonlinear phenomena such as phase separation @xcite and solitons @xcite , and provides an attractive setting for exploring nonequilibrium dynamics @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures ( which we treat as distinct from spinor gases @xcite ) have been achieved experimentally with two hyperfine states of the same isotope  @xcite , with different atomic species  @xcite and different isotopes of the same species  @xcite . under the former scenario ,",
    "it is common to first form a bose - condensed gas with atoms in a single hyperfine state and then to coherently transfer a population of the atoms into a second hyperfine state .",
    "most commonly this is performed with @xmath0rb and its @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperfine states .",
    "the population transfer is induced by the application of one or more electromagnetic coupling pulses which drive rabi oscillations between the states , and controllable through the length and amplitude of the pulses .",
    "this approach has been employed to study collective modes of the system @xcite , phase dynamics @xcite , pattern formation @xcite , crossover from triangular to square vortex lattices @xcite and to measure _ s_-wave scattering lengths @xcite . the same principle is also exploited for outcoupling atoms to an untrapped state for the production of atom laser beams @xcite .",
    "importantly , the timescale of the atom transfer ( set by the rabi frequency ) is typically an order of magnitude shorter than the timescale of the external dynamics @xcite .",
    "in other words , the atom transfer is effectively instantaneous with respect to the external dynamics , such that the binary mixture is formed in a non - equilibrium state . in the mean - field context of the ordinary gpe",
    ", the dynamics and collective modes of the _ condensate _ following the population transfer have been successfully modelled by a system of coupled gross ",
    "pitaevskii equations ( gpes  see e.g. refs @xcite ) . within this gpe model",
    ", the variable @xmath3 refers directly to the condensate .",
    "however , a more fundamental question exists over the _ thermodynamic _ evolution from the non - equilibrium state .",
    "one would anticipate that the instantaneous atom transfer could heat the system and reduce the condensate fraction .",
    "this effect is the motivation for the current work .    in order to theoretically model thermal excitations and hence describe variations in condensate fraction",
    ", one must progress beyond the standard mean - field approximation to a model which describes both the condensate and the thermal atoms in the gas .",
    "various finite - temperature descriptions of bose - condensed gases exist ( see @xcite for reviews ) , briefly classified into two categories : in symmetry - breaking approaches , one maintains a single - mode condensate description , supplementing a slightly amended dissipative gpe for the condensate with a ( quantum ) boltzmann equation for the thermal atoms @xcite ; an alternative approach , which is more commonly implemented numerically , is based on the identification that the main dynamics of interest happen in the low - lying modes .",
    "these modes are typically highly - occupied and can thus be treated classically .",
    "this leads to a multi - mode description of the system in which the classical field also obeys the gpe , but now encompassing both the condensate and the low - lying excitations in a unified manner  @xcite . in order to make use of such a classical field description",
    ", one needs to have populations initially distributed in modes other than the condensate mode ( see also variants of this method  @xcite based on slightly different initial mode seeding ) .",
    "this can be facilitated by a ( non - zero ) initial condition across all classical modes , which thus enables mode - mixing during the numerical evolution .",
    "subsequently , the `` classical field '' gpe will thermalize to the classical thermal distribution of the system .",
    "the power of the classical field methods is evidenced in their success in modelling phenomena and extracting quantities not accessible to the standard gpe , such as thermal equilibration dynamics  @xcite , condensate fractions @xcite , critical temperatures @xcite , correlation functions @xcite and spontaneous production of vortex - antivortex pairs in quasi-2d gases @xcite .",
    "the seminal numerical demonstration of this method for a single - species bose gas ( in a 3d periodic box ) is presented in ref .",
    "the simulation begins from a strongly nonequilibrium state where the mode occupation numbers @xmath4 are uniformly distributed over wavenumber @xmath5 ( up to the cutoff in momentum introduced by the numerical grid or a more rigorous cutoff defined by a  projector \" @xcite ) , and the phase of each component is randomized . at early times",
    "the system is weakly turbulent .",
    "self - ordering of the system leads to the growth of occupation numbers at low @xmath5 . over time the mode occupation @xmath4 evolves towards an equilibrium corresponding to the ` classical ' ( rayleigh  jeans ) limit of the bose - einstein distribution @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the energy of mode @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath8 is temperature and @xmath9 is the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "providing the system is in the regime of @xmath10space for bose - einstein condensation to occur , then the equilibrium state consists of a quasi - condensate at low @xmath5 , characterized by macroscopic mode populations ( within which the @xmath11 mode is associated with the true condensate , @xmath12 ) , and a thermal non - condensate at high @xmath5 , with low mode occupations .",
    "the quasi - condensate has superfluid ordering and exists in a state of superfluid turbulence , featuring a tangle of quantum vortices which slowly relaxes over time .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium state , and hence its characteristic condensate fraction and temperature , is uniquely determined by the initial atom number and energy @xcite .    the miscibility / immiscibility of binary bose gases is a determining factor in their static and dynamic properties .",
    "the species are immiscible when the _ interspecies _ interactions , characterized by the coefficient @xmath13 , are more repulsive than the _ intraspecies _ interactions , characterized by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the immiscibility criteria can be written as  @xcite , @xmath16 in this regime , it is favourable for the two species to separate spatially , supporting phase - separated equilibrium density profiles in , for example , side - by - side and ball - in - shell formations @xcite . from nonequilibrium conditions ,",
    "complicated dynamical phenomena can also arise driven by the interplay between the two species , such as superfluid ring excitations @xcite , transient structures during growth @xcite and the formation of topological defects in the form of dark - bright solitons @xcite .",
    "the evolution of binary bose gases from highly nonequilibrium initial conditions has also been studied previously in the miscible regime @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will study the nonequilibrium dynamics following the separation of an equilibrated , homogeneous bose - condensed gas into two species , performed via classical field simulations .",
    "in particular we map out how the final equilibrated state of each species , characterized by their condensate fractions , varies with the amount of population transfer and the interspecies interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we introduce the classical field method of the binary bose gas , and discuss the generation of the equilibrated single - species gas and the subsequent component separation .",

    "we give our closing remarks in sec .",

    "the system energy is given by the integral @xmath38    for simplicity we consider the gases to exist within a three - dimensional periodic box ; then the true condensate of each species is identified as the zero momentum mode .",
    "the dimensionless coupled gpes are solved numerically on a cubic grid of size @xmath39 using a fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the time step is @xmath40 and the ( isotropic ) grid spacing is @xmath41 .",
    "this spatial discretization implies that momentum is discretized into discrete modes and that high momenta are not described . to formalize the latter effect ,",
    "an ultraviolet cutoff is introduced such that @xmath42 for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "this cutoff , which arises numerically in practice , is also required formally to prevent an ultraviolet catastrophe in the classical field model .",
    "as long as the grid size exceeds @xmath45 , the equilibrium properties predicted by classical field simulations , e.g. final condensate fraction , are effectively independent of grid size  @xcite ( although the time scale to reach equilibrium does depend on grid size ) .",
    "our physical scenario begins with a single - species bose - condensed gas which is already at equilibrium . taking this to be species 1 ( and dropping the 1 subscript for brevity ) , we form this equilibrated state via classical field propagation of the gpe for species 1 ,",

    ", we can expect the inhomogeneous density to have a qualitatively similar effect on the nature of the condensate fraction .",
    "nonetheless we expect that the @xmath11 mode will provide an important and insightful metric to characterise the thermodynamic state of the gas .",
    "we seek to establish how the binary bose gas , formed instantaneously via population transfer , evolves from its non - equilibrium state and what the equilibrium properties are .",
    "the key parameters that will dictate the thermodynamical evolution are the population transfer @xmath65 , the intraspecies interactions and the interspecies interactions . below we",

    "we begin by considering the intraspecies interactions to be equal @xmath74 and for each species to have the same population ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we can write the immiscibility criteria ( [ eqn : crit ] ) as @xmath76 ( assuming repulsive intraspecies interactions ) , which simplifies to @xmath77 for the intraspecies interactions considered here .",

    "[ fig : equal](a ) , which plots the equilibrium condensate fractions @xmath78 for each species as a function of the interspecies interactions @xmath13 ( expressed in units of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the condensate fractions are scaled by their initial values , that is , the condensate fraction of the equilibrated single - species gas ( @xmath79 for the arbitrary parameters we employ here ) .",
    "the final equilibrium condensate fractions , according to the ergodic theorem , are determined by time - averaging the condensate fractions ( here over 1000 time units ) following their saturation to a constant average value .",
    "note that the size of the thermal fluctuations , characterized by the standard deviation of this data , are small .",
    "note also that the results for species 1 and species 2 are indistinguishable to within the statistical noise ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : equal](b ) ) and so only the results for species 1 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](a ) .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](a ) that the equilibrium state of the system depends critically on whether the two - species system is miscible ( @xmath80 ) or immiscible ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we now discuss each case in turn .      for @xmath80",
    "the final condensate fraction in each of the two condensates remains close to that of the original condensate ( represented by the horizontal grey line ) . to illustrate the dynamics in more detail ,",
    "we show how the condensate fraction evolves in fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](b ) for the example value @xmath82 ( thick red lines , top ) . immediately following the population transfer at @xmath83 ,",
    "there is a sharp spike in the condensate fraction ; this feature , which we observe for all simulations , is associated with the small but noticeable energy driven into the system by the noise terms @xmath84 in the transformations ( [ eqn : split ] ) .",
    "we have confirmed that reducing the noise amplitude reduces the amplitude of this feature but does not affect the equilibrium properties .",
    "there is a subsequent small modulation of the condensate fractions , but these settle to values which are very close to the original . during the evolution",
    "the mode occupations ( left inset ) undergo no visible changes , being dominated throughout by the macroscopic population of the @xmath11 mode .",
    "we observe similar dynamics for all miscible cases ( @xmath80 ) , with the final equilibrium condensate fraction differing by at most a few percent from the original condensate . in general",
    ", the population transfer process modifies the total energy per particle : while the kinetic energy per particle is unchanged , the self - interaction energy becomes reduced ( due to the quadratic scaling of self - interaction energy with particle density ) and interspecies interaction energy is introduced . over time",
    "there is then a weak equilibration within each species",
    ".    within the miscible regime there exist two special cases .",
    "for @xmath85 the two species evolve independently over time . for @xmath86 , and assuming @xmath74 , the energy - per - particle in each species is the same as in the original bose gas ( and with the same proportion of kinetic and interaction energy ) , barring the weak effect of noise introduced during splitting . for both of these special cases the final condensate fraction is identical ( within noise ) to that of the original single - species bose gas .",
    "for @xmath77 the equilibrium condensate fractions are dramatically reduced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](a ) ) .",
    "consider the example case for @xmath87 ( thin blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](b ) , bottom ) .",
    "following the population transfer , the condensate fractions drop rapidly ( over tens of time units ) , levelling out at around @xmath88 of their initial value .",
    "the origin of this reduction is as follows .",
    "the population transfer forms two immiscible species with overlapping density profiles ( identical apart from the imposed noise ) and drives interaction energy into the system . from this energetically unfavourable state ,",
    "the strong and repulsive interspecies interactions induce the species to phase - separate .",
    "this process imparts opposing momentum to the species , which is evident in the sudden population of finite-@xmath5 modes following population transfer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](b ) , right inset ) .",
    "in doing so , interspecies interaction energy becomes converted into kinetic energy , raising the average kinetic energy per particle , and leading to a lower final condensate fraction .",
    "for the miscible case , the population transfer can also drive interaction energy into the system but , crucially , there is no subsequent phase separation and hence no significant growth of kinetic energy . as discussed earlier , in the immiscible regime , the deformation of a species due to the effective confining by the other may lead to the population of the @xmath11 mode not coinciding with the penrose  onsager condensate .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](a ) are independent of the original single - species condensate fraction ( hence the motivation for scaling the @xmath89-axis in terms of this quantity ) .",
    "we have verified this by starting from single - species condensates with different condensate fractions ( obtained from starting the single - species simulation with different energy densities ) , and find the results to be consistent with the data in fig .  [ fig : equal](a ) . in other words , the final condensate fraction is a fixed ratio of the initial fraction , depending only on the interactions @xmath90 .",
    "we now move on to consider unequal populations and consider the example case of @xmath91 .",
    "the final condensate fraction , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unequal](a ) , shows a more complicated dependence on @xmath90 than for equal populations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : equal](a ) ) .",
    "in particular , we now see that species 1 ( circles ) , which has the smaller number of particles , often has a lower condensate fraction than species 2 ( triangles ) .",
    "what s more , species 2 can develop a condensate fraction which is slightly _ higher _ than the original condensate ( grey line ) .",
    "the special nature of the values @xmath85 and @xmath72 is even more evident for unequal populations ; only here do the condensate fractions become equal to each other and equal to the original condensate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : unequal](b ) we show the evolution for a miscible case , @xmath82 ( thick red curves ) . after the population transfer and following the noise - induced cusp ,",
    "the condensate fraction @xmath92 of species 1 decays slowly to around @xmath93 of its initial value , while that of species 2 increases by approximately @xmath94 . for the immiscible case , @xmath87 ( thin blue curve )",
    ", we see the much faster and larger decay of species 1 condensate fraction , reducing by around @xmath95 , while that of species 2 increases slightly ( a few percent ) .",
    "these curves are typical of the behaviour in the miscible and immiscible regimes , respectively , providing one is away from the special values of @xmath13 .    in the immisicible regime",
    ", the condensate in species 1 mostly `` boils off '' , leaving behind only a weakly populated condensate .",
    "this is again associated with the phase separation dynamics which proceed the population transfer . here ,",
    "for unequal splitting , species 1 gains more kinetic energy per particle than species 2 , due to the low total mass / inertia of species 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : frac_equal ] shows the equilibrium condensate fractions ( scaled by their initial value ) in each species as a function of both the population transfer @xmath65 and the interspecies interactions @xmath13 .",
    "light / dark areas represent low / high condensate fractions .",
    "the two special values of interspecies interactions , @xmath85 and @xmath72 , are even more apparent since the condensate fractions here remain unchanged for all values of @xmath65 .",
    "the values @xmath96 and @xmath97 represent special cases of the population transfer for which only one species is relevant , while @xmath75 ( discussed earlier ) is special in that both species have identical dynamics and properties . in the rest of the parameter space",
    "the general trend as @xmath65 increases is for a reduction in the condensate fraction of species 1 and an increase of it in species 2 . for sufficiently extreme population transfer ( @xmath98 or @xmath99 ) the condensate fraction of the smaller component diminishes to around zero ( white regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_equal ] ) and the condensate fraction in the larger component can slightly exceed the original value . in the immiscible regime ( @xmath77 )",
    "this extends to more moderate values of @xmath65 .    ) for species 1 ( left ) and species 2 ( right ) as a function of the population transfer @xmath65 and the interspecies interactions @xmath90 .",
    "the species are assumed to have equal intraspecies interactions ( @xmath74).[fig : frac_equal],scaledwidth=48.0% ]      all of the results discussed so far have been for equal intraspecies interactions , @xmath74 . for @xmath100 the results are qualitatively similar , except with the miscible and immiscible regimes becoming shifted according to the immiscibility criterion @xmath76 . for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperfine states of @xmath0rb , @xmath14 and @xmath15 differ by less than @xmath101 @xcite such that this shift is small .",
    "starting from an equilibrated bose - condensed gas , we have considered the experimentally - motivated scenario in which a proportion of the atoms are coherently transferred into a different species , thereby forming a non - equilibrium binary bose gas mixture .",
    "using classical field simulations in a homogeneous box we have analyzed the ensuing dynamics and final state of each species , highlighting the strong dependence on whether the components are miscible or immiscible .",
    "for equally populated components , the final condensate fractions vary little from that of the original bose gas when the components are miscible , but reduce significantly when the components are immiscible .",
    "this can be related to the phase separation dynamics which follow the population transfer and which cause a growth in kinetic energy at the expense of the interspecies interactions . for unequal populations",
    "the general trend is for the smaller component to undergo a reduction in condensate fraction , which for even moderate parameters can lead to the condensate fraction becoming effectively zero ; meanwhile the condensate fraction of the larger components typically increases , albeit by a smaller amount .    in considering a homogeneous system",
    "we have revealed the rudimentary role of interactions on the equilibration dynamics . in experiments , however , bose gases are confined in trapping potentials , usually harmonic in shape , which further influence the system through the imposition of an inhomogeneous density profile and a boundary .",
    "while this significantly changes the stationary density distributions of binary condensates , e.g. , leading to ball - in - shell phase - separated states @xcite , and their dynamical properties , e.g. quench dynamics @xcite and shape oscillations @xcite , the atomic interactions remain a dominant influence on the system .",
    "importantly , the miscible and immiscible regimes , which drive our main observations in the condensate fractions , persist in the presence of a trap ( albeit with the crossover shifted by the effects of quantum pressure arising from the inhomogeneous density @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , for the scenario of a single - species bose gas the equilibration dynamics have been shown to be qualitatively similar between homogeneous @xcite and trapped systems @xcite .",
    "as such , we can expect our results to also provide _ qualitative _ insight into the equilibration of trapped bose gases .",
    "our chosen identification of the condensate as the @xmath11 mode ( which does not account for condensate deformation induced by phase - separated density inhomogeneities ) , could be improved by defining the condensate as the macroscopically - occupied eigenmode ( which in practice requires numerically - intensive diagonalization of the one - body density matrix ) .",
    "this would also be crucial for considering the experimentally relevant scenario of harmonic external confinement of the gas .",
    "in this context we remark that recent studies of quenched immiscible trapped binary condensates indicate that the condensate fractions are practically independent of the actual spatial distribution of the condensates @xcite .",
    "the specific scenario we consider of a binary bose gas with equal masses has been performed experimentally with trapped bose gases of @xmath0rb , most commonly utilizing the hyperfine states @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this system has @xmath102 @xcite and lies just in the immiscible regime .",
    "our results suggest a sizeable reduction in condensate fraction of at least one of the two components , intrinsic to the rapid population transfer procedure performed in experiments . in future work",
