    "weakly magnetized neutron stars can be spun up to rates of several 100  hz by accretion in low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the first direct measurements of millisecond spin rates in actively accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) came from the discovery of oscillations in thermonuclear x - ray bursts occurring on the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "the burst oscillation frequencies were later found to be nearly equal to those of coherent pulsations @xcite implying that the burst oscillation frequency indicates the neutron star spin rate .",
    "this x - ray technique has no known biases against the detection of very high spin rates , unlike radio pulsation searches , and the sample of x - ray burst oscillation frequencies has been exploited to constrain the neutron star spin rate distribution .",
    "analysis of a sample of 11 x - ray measured spin frequencies in the range 270 - 619  hz suggests a limiting spin rate near 760  hz if the distribution is uniform and bounded @xcite . this is below the expected maximum spin frequency possible without centrifugal breakup and has been interpreted as evidence that some physical process , possibly gravitational radiation , limits the maximum possible spin rate .",
    "however , the discovery of a radio pulsar spinning at 716  hz , a frequency above any previously measured in x - rays , suggests that the true maximum spin rate is higher @xcite .    here , we describe observations made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) following the detection of x - ray bursts from the transient source xte j1739 - 285 as part of a program to search for millisecond oscillations in both x - ray bursts and persistent emission from neutron star x - ray binaries which are newly discovered or found to be active @xcite .",
    "we detected six x - ray bursts and found oscillations at a frequency of 1122  hz in the brightest burst .",
    "this suggests that xte j1739 - 285 contains the most rapidly rotating neutron star yet discovered .",
    "we describe our observations in  2 , the x - ray bursts in  3 , and the persistent emission and the discovery of khz qpos from the source in  4 .",
    "we discuss the results in  5 .",
    "xte j1739 - 285 is a transient neutron - star low - mass x - ray binary ( ns - lmxb ) that was discovered during rxte pca scans of the galactic bulge on 1999 october 19 @xcite and underwent short outbursts in may 2001 and october 2003 .",
    "the source became active again in august 2005 @xcite and two x - ray bursts were detected with the jem - x instrument on integral on 2005 september 30 and october 4 @xcite .",
    "triggered by the detection of the x - ray bursts , we obtained 19 observations using rxte in the period beginning 2005",
    "october 12 and ending 2005 november 16 .",
    "data were obtained with the proportional counter array ( pca ) in a spectral mode ( standard 2 ) with 256 energy channels and 16  s time resolution , a low - resolution timing mode ( standard 1 ) with no energy information and 0.125  s time resolution , and a high - resolution timing mode ( event mode ) with 122  @xmath1s time resolution and 64 energy channels @xcite .",
    "we searched the standard 1 data for x - ray bursts and found six , see table  [ bursttable ] .",
    "we examined their evolution by extracting spectra for 0.25  s intervals of event mode data using all proportional counter units ( pcus ) that were on during each burst and all layers .",
    "the fluxes were corrected for dead time effects with a maximum correction of 5.5% . to remove the contribution of the persistent emission , we subtracted off a spectrum from 10  s of data preceding each burst .",
    "spectra were fitted in the 3 - 18  kev band ( channels 3 - 24 in the event mode data ) with an absorbed blackbody model with the column density fixed to @xmath2 which is the hydrogen column density along the line of sight in the milky way @xcite .",
    "we found a burst - like event at nov 11 10:27:22 utc which appears in only one of four pcus on at the time and is likely a detector breakdown event and not an x - ray burst .",

    "the blackbody temperature rose rapidly during the flux rise , reached a maximum near 2.5  kev , and then decayed as the flux decayed . this behavior is indicative of heating during the rise and cooling during the decay and is characteristic of type i x - ray bursts .",
    "@xcite found that the empirical maximum bolometric peak luminosities for photospheric radius expansion bursts from a sample of 12 bursters located in globular clusters with known distances was @xmath10 , with an accuracy of @xmath1115% .",
    "none of our bursts showed evidence of photospheric radius expansion and , thus , their luminosities should be below this value .",
    "the peak flux of the brightest burst implies an upper limit on the distance to xte j1739 - 285 of about 10.6  kpc .",
    "this is consistent with , but somewhat closer than , the upper limit of 12  kpc from @xcite .",
    "bursts 1 and 4 - 6 have similar peak fluxes , while bursts 2 and 3 were brighter , see table  [ bursttable ] . burst 3 had a rise time near 3  s , while the other rise times were near 1  s. burst 6 had a relatively broad maximum extending over 5  s. the decay ( @xmath12-folding ) times are in the range 36  s. the fact that the bursts have fast rises and durations of tens of seconds suggests that they are typical helium bursts .",
    "using high time resolution data , we computed power spectra for overlapping 4  s intervals with 0.125  s between the starts of successive intervals using events in pha channels 4 - 24 for pcu0 and channels 3 - 24 all other pcus .",
    "the background , particularly at low energies , is higher in pcu0 due to the loss of its propane layer .",
    "we searched over the duration of each burst defined as the interval where the total counting rate exceeds the background plus persistent counting rate , measured a few seconds before the burst , by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "we searched for excess power in the range 20 - 2000  hz , corresponding to 7920 frequency bins in the 4  s ffts .",
    "we found oscillations in the second burst with a leahy normalized power @xcite of 42.82 at a frequency of @xmath13  hz , occurring in the burst decay 15  s after the burst rise , see fig .",
    "[ burst2dyn ] .",
    "the four consecutive ffts around the one with the peak power all have powers above 40.31 at 1122.0  hz .",
    "to evaluate the significance of the signal , we used a monte carlo simulation which generates poisson distributed events following the light curve from burst 2 in 0.125  s bins after smoothing with a moving average over 9 bins .",
    "the deadtime of the pca is modeled by removing any event which occurs within 10  @xmath1s after a previous event @xcite .",
    "the number of events generated in each time bin is larger than the observed counts so that after the deadtime correction the number matches that in the actual light curve within poisson fluctuations .",
    "we generated 400,000 trial bursts .",
    "each simulated burst was analyzed using exactly the same analysis done on the real data , specifically by calculating 4  s ffts at overlapping intervals with starts each 0.125 seconds and searching for power in the 20 - 2000  hz interval .",
    "the chance probability of occurrence of the observed signal is calculated by counting the fraction of trial bursts with powers equal to or exceeding those observed .",
    "this procedure eliminates the ambiguity in estimating the equivalent number of independent trials for the overlapping ffts .",
    "we found 58 bursts with at least one power above 42.82 of which 14 had at least 4 consecutive powers above 40.31 at the same frequency .",
    "we estimate the chance probability of occurrence of the observed signal to be @xmath14 . allowing two trials for two energy bands , the probability is @xmath15 equivalent to a @xmath16 confidence level .",
    "the signal at 1122  hz was detected in the brightest burst .",
    "since the bursts are not a uniform sample and the presence of oscillations may depend on burst properties and/or accretion history ( e.g.  watts , strohmayer , markwardt 2005 ) , one can reasonably argue that the significance should be evaluated for each burst individually , particularly in this case since the brightest burst is the most likely to give a detectable signal .",
    "however , a more conservative approach is to consider the full set of six bursts .",
    "the durations of the bursts , as defined above , are 21 , 21 , 22 , 10 , 11 , and 18  s for bursts 16 , respectively . to account for all the trials in all the bursts ,",
    "we multiply the number of trials by an additional factor of 103/21 = 4.9 for a chance probability of @xmath17 .",
    "the oscillation is detected at a confidence level of 99.966% , equivalent to a @xmath18 significance .        to obtain an estimate of the significance of the oscillations which does not depend on a simulation , we calculated ffts in independent 4  s , 2  s , and 1  s intervals of data from burst 2 .",
    "there are five successive 1  s ffts with power at 1122 hz , see fig .",
    "[ burst2i ] .",
    "the single trial probability for having five powers at or above the observed levels in the 1  s ffts is @xmath19 .",
    "accounting for all sequential combinations of ffts of fixed length of 1 , 2 , or 4  s with a total duration of 5  s or less covering the 20 - 2000  hz range in two energy bands , we estimate a total of 605880 trials : ( 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21)@xmath201980@xmath202 + ( 9 + 10)@xmath203960@xmath202 + 5@xmath207920@xmath202 .",
    "the chance probability taking into account the number of trials in the one burst is then @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "accounting for the other bursts , the chance probability is @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this probability agrees within a factor of 3 with that in the previous paragraph .    in the 4  s interval with the maximum power ,",
    "the fractional rms amplitude of the 1122.0  hz oscillation is @xmath25 .",
    "the quality factor , @xmath26 , of the oscillation in burst 2 is @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with the values found in burst oscillations and inconsistent with the values found in high frequency qpos in the persistent emission .",
    "we searched for oscillations near half the frequency .",
    "the strongest signal has a leahy power of 13.6 at 561.25  hz and occurs 7.75  s after the burst rise .",
    "this is not a significant signal ; the chance probability of occurrence within the narrow window searched , 562.5 - 558.5  hz , is 0.09 . at the time of the maximum strength of the 1122  hz signal ,",
    "the leahy power near 561  hz is less than 6 .",
    "to study the persistent emission spectra , we used standard-2 data from pcu 2 , removing data around the x - ray bursts , and estimating the background using bright source background files .",
    "the source was in a relatively hard state , with a hard x - ray color , @xmath28 , defined as the count rate in the 9.716  kev band divided by the 6.09.7  kev rate , of @xmath29 for all observations before october 25 .",
    "the flux was roughly constant and near @xmath30 in the 2 - 20  kev band .",
    "the spectra were adequately described by the absorbed ( @xmath2 ) sum of a power - law with a photon index near 2 and a gaussian emission line with a centroid of 6.7  kev and a flux consistent with that from galactic ridge emission at the source position @xcite .",
    "after october 25 , the source stayed in a softer state , @xmath31 .",
    "the flux varied by a factor of two , with the maximum near @xmath32 in the 2 - 20  kev band .",
    "the spectra showed distinct curvature at high energies and were adequately fitted with the absorbed sum of a comptonization model ( compst in xspec ) with a temperature in the range 412  kev and an optical depth in the range 310 , a blackbody with a temperature near 1.6  kev , and a gaussian emission line with a centroid of 6.7  kev , a width less than 0.9  kev , and an equivalent width of 100 - 300  ev , in some cases larger than the expected galactic ridge emission .",
    "the blackbody component was not required for some lower flux observations .",

    "we did not detect two simultaneous khz qpos in any observation .",
    "these observations establish that xte j1739 - 285 exhibits millisecond oscillations in its persistent x - ray emission .",
    "the properties of the source are generally similar to those of other atoll neutron - star x - ray binaries , although the evolution of the timing noise in the banana state is unusual .",
    "the signal at 1122  hz present in burst 2 is significant at the 99.96% confidence level .",
    "if this signal represents a true burst oscillation then it would be of substantial interest .",
    "the near equality of the burst oscillation frequency with the frequency of coherent pulsations in the millisecond pulsars sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite and xte j1814 - 338 @xcite and the frequency of coherent pulsations in a superburst from 4u 1636 - 536 @xcite strongly suggests that the burst oscillation frequency indicates the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "the lack of any significant signal near 561  hz in the burst from xte j1739 - 285 supports this interpretation and suggests that the possible 1122  hz oscillation would be most naturally interpreted as the spin rate of the neutron star .",
    "if the burst oscillation frequency of 1122  hz is the spin rate of the neutron star , then xte j1739 - 285 contains the most rapidly rotating neutron star yet discovered .",
    "this spin rate is close to the centrifugal breakup limit for some equations of state of nuclear matter @xcite and , therefore , may remove the motivation for a physical limit on neutron star spin other than the centrifugal breakup limit .",
    "furthermore , such a high spin rate would place constraints on the nuclear equation of state , particularly if combined with a measurement of the mass and/or radius of the neutron star .",
