    "ricci curvature is a fundamental concept in riemannian geometry , which provides a way of measuring the degree to which the geometry determined by a given riemannian metric might differ from that of @xmath3 .",
    "ricci curvature plays an important role in general relativity , where it is the key term in the einstein field equations , and in the celebrated ricci flow equation , where a time - dependent riemannian metric is deformed in the direction of negative its ricci curvature .",
    "bakry and mery @xcite attempted to define ricci - curvature through the heat semigroup on a metric measure space .",
    "in the recent years , there has been several work on defining a synthetic ricci curvature on general metric measure spaces by sturm @xcite , lott and villani @xcite , and ohta @xcite .    in the context of graphs , chung and yau",
    "@xcite developed the notion of ricci - flat graphs , while proving log - sobolev inequalities .",
    "later , lin and yau @xcite generalized the notion of bakry and mery to the framework of graphs .",
    "finally , ollivier @xcite introduced a notion of coarse ricci - curvature that extends to any markov chains on metric spaces .",
    "this was used to generalize a series of classical theorems in positive ricci - curvature , such as spectral gap estimates , concentration of measure or log - sobolev inequalities @xcite .",
    "joulin and ollivier @xcite proved nonasymptotic estimates for the rate of convergence of empirical means of markov chains , together with a gaussian or exponential control on the deviations of empirical means , under the assumption of positive curvature of the underlying space .",
    "this assumption reduces to the well - known contraction under path coupling when the underlying space is a finite graph , which has been used extensively to prove fast mixing of several discrete markov chains ( refer to chapter 14 of levin et al .",
    "@xcite for details on path coupling and its application to fast mixing and approximate counting of proper @xmath4-colorings of a graph ) .",
    "recently , ollivier s ricci - curvature has been studied in the context of graph by jost and liu @xcite , paeng @xcite , and cho and paeng @xcite .",
    "lin et al .",
    "@xcite considered a modified definition of ricci - curvature of graphs , and proved several analogous results . in this paper",
    "we study ollivier s ricci - curvature on graphs using the markov kernel of the simple random walk on the graph .",
    "we obtain exact formulas for ricci - curvature for bipartite graphs and for the graphs with girth at least 5 .",
    "previously , an exact formula was only known for graphs with girth at least 6 @xcite .",
    "our formulas extend these results and provide , for the first time , exact expressions for the ricci - curvature for a large class of graphs . using these results",
    "we characterize ricci - flat graphs of girth at least 5 .",
    "we also prove several other bounds on the ricci - curvature , involving different graph parameters .",
    "the most interesting among them is the derivation of a general lower bound in terms of the size of the maximum matching in an appropriate neighborhood subgraph . using this we a first necessary and sufficient condition on the structure of ricci - flat regular graphs of girth 4 . finally , using some results from approximate matching in random graphs , we study the asymptotic behavior of ricci - curvature of random bipartite graphs @xmath0 and random graphs @xmath1 , in various regimes of @xmath2 .      in this section",
    "we recall some basic facts about ollivier s ricci curvature on graphs and introduce other relevant definitions and notations .    for two probability measures @xmath5 on a metric space @xmath6 , the _ transportation distance _ ( or the _ wasserstein distance _ ) between them is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the collection of probability measures on @xmath9 with marginals @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". another useful representation of the transportation distance is through the celebrated kantorovich duality ( theorem 1.14 , villiani @xcite ) , which states that @xmath12 where the supremum is taken over all functions @xmath13 which satisfy @xmath14 , for all @xmath15 .",
    "the transportation distance between probability measure is used to define the ricci - curvature of metric measure spaces .",

    "the coarse ricci curvature of a metric measure space is defined as follows :    on any metric measure space @xmath19 , for any two distinct points @xmath15 , the _ coarse ricci curvature _ of @xmath19 of @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 .",

    "for each @xmath32 define a probability measure @xmath33 note that these are just the transition probabilities of a simple random walk on the vertices of @xmath26 .",

    "recently , there has been a series of papers on coarse ricci - curvature when the metric space is a graph @xmath26 .",
    "jost and liu proved the following general bounds :    [ th : jost ] for any graph @xmath26 , with @xmath36 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of triangles supported on @xmath20 .",
    "they also show that the above lower bound is tight for trees .",
    "in fact , it is clear from their proof that the lower bound is an equality whenever there are no 3 , 4 , or 5 cycles supported on @xmath20 . in particular , the lower bound is tight whenever @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the girth of the graph @xmath26 .",
    "recently , cho and paeng @xcite proved this independently , and also showed that the girth condition and the tree formula , obtained by putting @xmath61 in the lower bound in ( [ eq : jlcp ] ) , are equivalent in the following sense : the tree formula holds for all @xmath36 , if and only if @xmath59 .",
    "cho and paeng @xcite also proved other ricci - curvature bounds involving girth .",
    "in particular , they showed that if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the minimum degree in @xmath26 , and @xmath36 .",
    "they also obtained interesting lower bounds on the clique number and chromatic number of a graph with the ricci curvature .",
    "paeng @xcite used ollivier s ricci curvature to obtain upper bounds of diameter and volume for finite graphs .",
    "lin et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a different notion of ricci - curvature on graphs by modifying ollivier s definition .",
    "it is defined as the differential limit of a lazy random random walk on the graph , and we shall refer to it as the modified ricci - curvature to distinguish it from ollivier s coarse ricci - curvature .",
    "the modified definition has some properties which are similar to the original definition , however , in several contexts they are very different . using the modified definition , they proved a theorem on the modified ricci curvature of the cartesian product of graphs .",
    "they established upper bounds for diameters and the number of vertices for graphs with positive curvatures , and also proved some asymptotic properties of modified ricci - curvature for random graphs .",
    "recently , lin et al . @xcite characterized the set of all modified ricci - flat graphs with girth at least 5 , where a graph is called modified ricci - flat whenever it has modified ricci - curvature zero for every edge in the graph .",
    "they showed that if @xmath26 is a connected modified ricci - flat graph with girth @xmath62 , then @xmath26 is the infinite path , or a cycle @xmath65 with @xmath66 , the dodecahedral graph , the petersen graph , or the half - dodecahedral graph .",
    "in this paper we obtain exact expressions of ollivier s ricci - curvature for bipartite graphs and for the graphs with girth at least 5 . for a bipartite graph @xmath26 with @xmath36",
    ", we show that the ricci - curvature has the form @xmath67 the explicit form of @xmath68 is given in theorem [ th : bipartite ] , and can be interpreted as a non - negative correction term which improves the lower bound in theorem [ th : jost ] to an exact equality .",

    "exact formulas for ricci - curvature were only know for the graphs with girth at least six @xcite .",
    "our results not only subsume these results , but also provide the first exact formulas for ricci - curvature for a large class of non - trivial graphs , namely graphs with no odd - cycles and graphs with no cycles smaller than 5 . as a consequence of these results ,",
    "we characterize the set of all ricci - flat graphs of girth at least 5 , where a graph @xmath26 is said to ricci - flat if @xmath71 for all @xmath36 .",
    "this is in analogue to the result on modified ricci - curvature of lin et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of ollivier s coarse ricci - curvature .    in theorem [ th : matching ]",
    "we prove a general lower bound on the ricci - curvature @xmath72 in terms of the size of the matching matching among the non - common neighbors of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the graph @xmath26 .",
    "this bound is often tight , especially in regular graphs which have a perfect matching between the non - common neighbors of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "as the set of all transportation matrices in @xmath73-regular graphs is related to the famous birkhoff polytope , our lower bound result combined with the celebrated birkhoff - von neumann theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition on the structure of ricci - flat regular graphs of girth 4 , which is detailed in corollary [ cor : ricciflat4 ] .    finally , we also study the ricci - curvature of random bipartite graphs @xmath0 ( theorem [ bp ] ) and random graphs @xmath1 ( theorem [ gnp ] ) , in various regimes of @xmath2 . using a stronger version of the hall s marriage theorem , and the existence of near - perfect matching in random bipartite graphs ,",
    "we obtain the limiting behavior of the ricci - curvature in the regimes of @xmath2 where it has a constant limit in probability .",
    "we also show that when @xmath74 , that is , the graph is locally tree - like , the ricci - curvature converges in distribution to the tree formula of jost and lin @xcite .",
    "these are the first known results for ollivier s ricci - curvature for erds - renyi random graphs .",
    "the analogous version of these results using the modified ricci - curvature were obtained by lin et al .",
    "they showed almost sure convergence to constant limits , but could not capture all the different regimes of @xmath2 .    in section [ sec :",
    "preliminaries ] we prove several important lemmas which build the foundations for proving the main results .",
    "we show that the computation of ricci - curvature on a graph can be formulated as a totally unimodular linear programming problem , and so it suffices to optimize over integer valued 1-lipschitz functions .",
    "we also prove a crucially important reduction lemma where we identify the exact neighborhood an edge @xmath36 that needs to be considered while computing the ricci - curvature @xmath75 . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our work and give directions for future work .",
    "we begin by proving an extension lemma for lipschitz function on graphs .",
    "let @xmath22 be a finite unweighted graph .",
    "let @xmath76 be a fixed subset of vertices , and @xmath23 the shortest path metric on @xmath26 .",
    "[ lip ] any 1-lipschitz function @xmath77 , that is , @xmath78 , for @xmath79 , can be extended to a 1-lipschitz function @xmath80 on @xmath26 , that is , @xmath78 , for @xmath81 .",
    "define @xmath82 on @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 be any point .",

    "moreover , by construction @xmath95 , for any two vertices @xmath96 . by repeating this constructing inductively for every @xmath97 , the result follows .",
    "next , we show that computing the transportation distance is a linear programming problem , with integral extreme points . to prove this we use the following result from linear programming ( theorem 2.2 , chapter 4 , yemelichev et al .",

    "the set of all feasible functions of this linear program forms a polytope in @xmath113 with finitely many extreme points .",
    "consider the digraph @xmath114 obtained by duplicating every edge of @xmath26 and orienting one each in both directions .",
    "as each of the constraints of the linear program are of the form @xmath115 for @xmath116 , the set of constraints can be written as @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where @xmath100 is the incidence matrix of the digraph @xmath114 , @xmath119 is the vector of values of @xmath120 with @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the diameter of the graph @xmath26 . as @xmath100 is totally unimodular ( theorem 13.9 , schrijver @xcite ) , the set of points of this linear program are integral , completing the proof of the lemma .",
    "the transportation distance , and hence the ricci curvature , of an edge @xmath36 , is a local property depending only on vertices which are close to @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this section",
