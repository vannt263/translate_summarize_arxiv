    "even though both macroscopic as well as microscopic heat engines work on the same thermodynamic principles , wide - ranging studies have been done in improving the performance of macroscopic heat engines @xcite . at present , the study of microscopic heat engines has received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "this is because of the trend in miniaturization and the need to utilize energy resources available at microscopic scales . as such",
    ", modelling microscopic heat engines and finding how well they perform is a primary task to be undertaken at present .    to get a first insight as to",
    "how such engines perform , it is important to take a toy model that has the basic ingredients . in a recent paper @xcite we considered a simple model of a brownian heat engine and found exact analytic expressions for quantities like current , efficiency and coefficient of performance .",
    "this , in turn , enabled us to explore different features of the engine such as efficiency at maximum power , optimized efficiency as well as efficiency at quasistatic limit .",
    "the present work addresses the same basic issues of a tiny heat engine",
    ". however , here the particle moves on a discrete lattice by hopping as opposed to a continuous brownian motion in a viscous medium . even though the model and its corresponding dynamics is completely different from the one previously studied ,",
    "the results can be compared with those of the previous work at least qualitatively . as such",
    ", this work can be taken as an independent check of the results found in the previous work on microscopic heat engine .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we will first introduce our model in the absence of external load and set up the dynamics governing it .",
    "we will then find analytic expressions for the steady - state current and the rate of heat produced as a function of the model parameters . in section iii , we will consider our model in the presence of an external load and find the steady - state current and the rate of heat flows . in section iv , expressions for the efficiency and coefficient of performance ( cop ) will be determined depending on whether the engine works as a heat engine or as a refrigerator .",
    "regions in the parameter space where the model works as a heat engine , as a refrigerator and as neither of the two will be determined .",
    "we will explore how current , efficiency and cop behave as the model parameters vary .",
    "we will also compare the efficiency of the engine at two operating conditions ( at maximum power and at optimum value with respect to energy and time ) with those of endoreversible and carnot engines .",
    "lastly , we summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "the model we take is a modified version of the one considered by jarzynski and mazonka @xcite in modelling feynmann s ratchet and pawl system .",
    "our model is meant to capture the motion of a particle in a ratchet potential due to the thermal kick it gets from periodically placed hot and cold reservoirs along the path .",
    "consider a particle that moves by hopping on a one - dimensional lattice , with lattice spacing d , assisted by the thermal kick it gets from periodically placed hot and cold reservoirs along its path .",
    "the particle is also exposed to an external discrete sawtooth potential which has the same period as that of the reservoirs . in one cycle",
    ", the particle walks a net displacement of three lattice sites , either to the right or to the left .",
    "this corresponds to the particle crossing one sawtooth of a sawtooth potential .",

    "figure 1 shows the values of sawtooth potential and of the temperature at the given lattice sites .",
    "the jump of the particle from one lattice site to next lattice site is assumed to be random in nature .",
    "the jump probability is determined by the amount of energy it crosses and the temperature of the heat reservoir to which it is coupled .",
    "accordingly , the jump probability per unit time of the particle making a jump from site @xmath0 to site @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the probability that the particle will attempt a jump per unit time .",
    "we take boltzmann s constant , @xmath15 , to be unity . when the particle attempts to jump , first it decides which way to jump ( either to the left or right ) with equal probability and then jumps according to the metropolis algorithm @xcite : if the value of @xmath16 , then the jump definitely takes place ; if @xmath17 then the jump takes place with probability @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamics of the model can be studied by mapping the model to a spin-1 particle system which exhibits identical behavior @xcite . denoting the spin states , @xmath19 , by @xmath20 ,",
    "the energy function of the spin-1 particle is defined by @xmath21 the change of state of spin @xmath19 corresponds to the jump of the particle . if s changes from -1 to 0 or from 0 to 1 or from 1 to -1 , then this is the same as the particle jumping to the right .",
    "the reverse process corresponds to jump to the left .",
    "the three possible states and their corresponding energy values is shown in the table i. +    .the three states of the system and their corresponding energies [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the dynamics of the particle is then described by stochastic jumps among the three states .",
    "the process is markovian and we can describe the evolution of the states with rate equations . let the probability for the system to be found in state @xmath22 at time @xmath23 be given by @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath28 is given by the metropolis rule .",
    "for example ,    @xmath29    in the above expressions , the factor @xmath30 is due to the decision for the particle to jump either to the left or to the right . the rate equation for the model can then be expressed as a matrix equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 . here",
    ", @xmath33 is a 3 by 3 matrix which is given by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "this shows that the total probability is conserved : @xmath38 .    the steady state probability distribution @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is obtained by solving @xmath40 .",
    "we find the normalized @xmath39 to have components given by    @xmath41    the presence of the hot and cold regions along the lattice leads to unidirectional steady state current , @xmath42 .",
    "this steady state current , @xmath42 , can be found as the difference between the current towards the right , @xmath43 , and the current towards the left , @xmath44 , between any two states : @xmath45 . selecting processes taking place between states 2 and 3 ,",
    "the current towards the right , @xmath46 , is given by @xmath47 while the current towards the left , @xmath44 , is given by @xmath48 after some algebra the explicit expression for the current @xmath42 takes a simple form @xmath49 in each cycle , the particle walks a net displacement of three lattice sites , 3d .",
    "therefore the drift velocity , @xmath50 , of the particle is @xmath51 notice that the net current is to the right as long as @xmath52 and zero when @xmath53 .",
    "let us next find the amount of heat transfer per cycle between the hot and cold reservoirs as the particle climbs up or down the potential .",
    "we assume the case where there is no energy transfer via kinetic energy due to particle recrossing of the boundary between the hot and cold reservoirs @xcite .",
    "when the particle jumps from state 2 to state 3 , it takes heat from the hot reservoir whose amount is sufficient to climb up the potential energy difference between the states and equal to @xmath5 .",
    "when the particle jumps from state 3 to state 2 , it gives heat to the hot reservoir by losing its potential energy and is equal to @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the net heat per unit time taken from the hot reservoir due to climbing up or down the potential , @xmath54 , is given by @xmath55 after substituting the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 from eqs .",
    "( 9)and ( 10 ) in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , we get @xmath58 when the particle jumps from state 3 to state 1 and from state 2 to state 1 , it gives heat to the cold reservoir .",
    "when it jumps from state 1 to state 3 and from state 1 to state 2 , it takes heat from the cold reservoir . the net heat per unit time given to the cold reservoir due to climbing up or down the potential is given by @xmath59 after substituting the values of @xmath60 s , we obtain @xmath61 the above results show that @xmath62 .",
    "this clearly shows that a heat taken from a hot reservoir directly goes to the cold reservoir without doing any work . unlike this work , in our previous work @xcite",
    ", there is work done against viscous medium even in the absence of external load .",
    "let us now compute the rate of entropy production .",
    "the rate of entropy production related with the flow of heat from the hot reservoir is given by @xmath63 while the rate of entropy production related with the flow of heat to the cold reservoir is : @xmath64 .",
    "the net rate of entropy production given by @xmath65 takes of the form , @xmath66 notice that @xmath67 is non - negative which implies that the system is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "let us consider the model in the presence of constant external load , @xmath68 , added to the sawtooth potential as shown in fig .",
    "2 . accordingly",
    ", the potential energy will now be changed from @xmath1 to @xmath69 .",
    "the method of solving for steady state behavior is the same as that for the load - free case .",
    "we consider our model when the load , @xmath68 , is greater than zero and for metropolis algorithm to hold , we need to limit the range of @xmath68 to @xmath70 for this range of the load , we find the matrix @xmath71 ,    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "note that the sum of each column of the matrix @xmath71 is zero , which shows that the total probability is conserved .",
    "the steady state probability @xmath75 satisfies the matrix equation , @xmath76 we solve for @xmath77 and after normalization the final results are of the form : @xmath78 using similar approach as in section ii , the expressions for the steady state current , @xmath79 , and the drift velocity , @xmath80 , are respectively found to be given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 when the brownian particle walks along the potential with additional load , it takes heat from the hot reservoir and gives some part of it to the cold reservoir and uses the rest for climbing up the load .",
    "the difference between the rate of heat energy that the brownian particle takes from the hot reservoir , @xmath83 , and the rate of heat energy that it gives to the cold reservoir , @xmath84 , is the rate of useful work , @xmath85 , that the particle uses to lift the load ; i.e ,    @xmath86    from eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) , we get @xmath87 the rate of heat energy taken from the hot reservoir by the particle , @xmath88 , can be obtained by a similar approach as in section ii and we find its expression to be @xmath89 the rate of heat energy given to the cold reservoir @xmath84 is given by @xmath90 the difference between @xmath91 will be @xmath92 which is exactly equal to @xmath93 as given in eq .",
    "to specify the model , one requires to specify the six quantities : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath96 and @xmath68 .",
    "taking @xmath97 , @xmath95 and @xmath6 fixed we still have three parameters @xmath5 , @xmath96 and @xmath98 that can be varied independently .",
    "we convert these into three dimenssionless parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , we introduce a dimenssionless current @xmath105 .",
    "we take @xmath106 for the rest of our work .",
    "the current j is now a function of @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath107 .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of @xmath108 versus @xmath107 for fixed values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the figure shows that the current is positive as long as the load is less than a certain value of @xmath107 .",
    "this corresponds to the region where the model works as a heat engine .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( 28 ) , ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) the efficiency of the heat engine , @xmath109 , takes the expression @xmath110 on the other hand , when the load is large enough the current becomes negative and that implies that the model works as a refrigerator .",
    "the cop , @xmath111 , of the refrigerator then takes the expression @xmath112 from this equation , eq .",
    "( 32 ) , we note that in order for the model to function as a refrigerator the upper limit for @xmath107 must be @xmath113 .     versus @xmath107 for @xmath114 and @xmath115",
    "the set of points in the parameter space at which current changes its direction differentiates the domain of operation of the model as a refrigerator from that as a heat engine . using the expression for @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( 24 ) , the value of @xmath107 at which the current reversal takes place is given by @xmath116 note that this value of the load where current is zero is usually called the stall force for molecular engines @xcite .",
    "when we evaluate the values of both @xmath109 and @xmath111 as we approach this boundary determined by eq .",
    "( 33 ) , we find that they are exactly equal to the respective values for the carnot efficiency and the carnot cop : @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the boundary at which current is zero corresponds to the quasistatic limit be it from the heat engine side or from the refrigerator side .",

    "in this work , we introduced an exactly solvable model of a heat engine with minimum ingredients .",
    "we obtained closed form expressions for current , efficiency and cop of the model .",
    "we showed that at quasistatic limit the values of both efficiency and cop go to that of carnot efficiency and carnot cop , respectively .",
    "we then explored the basic properties of the microscopic heat engine by varying the parameters describing the model .",
    "we further studied the efficiency when the engine operates with maximum power and compared this efficiency with those values one gets by using the finite - rate linear heat exchange assumption of curzon and ahlborn @xcite .",
    "the results of optimized efficiencies of the model are also reported .",
    "it is worth to note that the particle walks in non - viscous medium .",
    "hence the model does not work as a heat engine in the absence of external load .",
    "in the presence of external load , even though the model and its corresponding dynamics is completely different from the one we studied earlier , there is a qualitative agreement between this work and the earlier work .",
    "therefore , one can take this work as independent check of the results we found in the previous work on brownian heat engine @xcite .",
