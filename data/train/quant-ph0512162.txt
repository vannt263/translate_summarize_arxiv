    "<S> using path integrals we express the quantum nonlocality of ab - effect type in the form of singularity . the gauge - fixing term in path integrals </S>",
    "<S> induce the ab effect in ordinary scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> this means that all scattering processes are accompanied by nonlocal effect . </S>",
    "<S> the formulae are then extended to theory of fields that additionally include a scalar potential . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the degree of freedom of nonlocality in quantum fields is just the degree of the ghosts . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , renormalization method can be related to this type of nonlocal effect .    </S>",
    "<S> * e - mail address : whj@mail.jlu.edu.cn    _ introduction . _ </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocality in quantum mechanics has long been a hot topic in the past decades , and up to date there has been no experiment contradicting the nonlocality ; it refers to the correlation between two particles separated in space such as entanglement derived from the bell theory [ 1 ] and well confirmed in many experiments [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> all these experiments used massless photons as carriers of the states , and the nonlocality is of the bell type . </S>",
    "<S> the study of nonlocality has been also extended to a single photon , which is in a superposition state of two space - separated states such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as in the situation when a photon passes through a two - slit plane ( diffraction ) . </S>",
    "<S> this type of nonlocality is called hardy type [ 3 , 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional method of studying this type of states is to introduce two vacuum states @xmath2 and @xmath3 at two local regions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 [ 5 - 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then the correlation of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 is obvious when one couples them to entangled state @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> however , some authors argued that [ 8 ] for a single fermion , the above method is not effective any longer because the massive fermion manifests its nonlocality in a completely different way . since its nonlocality ca nt be transformed to explicit correlation as above , one ca nt measure it at location @xmath4 and @xmath5 and then evaluate how it violates the bell inequalities . through a tedious analysis </S>",
    "<S> , the authors arrived at the conclusion that the only type of nonlocality for a fermion ( except the collapse ) wave is of the ab - effect [ 9 ] type .    </S>",
    "<S> the ab effect for fermions has been well demonstrated by experiments [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it appears when a charged particle winds around a magnetic flux completing closed _ </S>",
    "<S> n _ ( integer ) loops . to understand the effect in more general circumstances [ 13 ] , </S>",
    "<S> one may ask what will happen if a charged particle is scattered by a very thin flux such as a spin moment . </S>",
    "<S> the answer to this question provides us with some more useful observables of nonlocality other than the familiar scattering results . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitudes and phase shifts have been studied quantitatively [ 14 , 15 ] , and distinguishing feature is that the scattering result loses the axile symmetry and dependence on the magnetic component appears . </S>",
    "<S> but , how does the nonlocal effect take place * simultaneously * with the scattering process remains elusive as does not make sense to require the charged particle to move around the flux for exactly _ </S>",
    "<S> n _ closed loops in a certain plane and then come back to fulfill the scattering process involving other interactions .    in this paper we will demonstrate that the nonlocal effect takes place when and only when scattering occurs . </S>",
    "<S> first , we prove that the aharonov - bohm effect can be reproduced if we introduce a singularity to the feynman path integral for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics . secondly , the condition of ( 2 + 1)-dimension can be removed by considering the gauge transformation and gauge - fixing condition . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , the nonlocality like ab - effect can be described using the same lagrangian with only an additional singularity . in above expression </S>",
    "<S> , we have viewed the fermion that is with magnetic moment as rest singularity , the other fermion is initial and final particle that being scattered . </S>",
    "<S> this view makes us aware that any scattering process is accompanied by the ab - like nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant formulae can be easily generalized to quantum field and thus to the non - abelian situation . </S>",
    "<S> it is showed that the degree of nonlocality is relevant to the degree of freedom of ghost fields . </S>",
    "<S> the application to the renormalization group is sketched .    in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we employ the path integral method of feynman to interpret the propagating process of the wave function [ 16 ] . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , using the kernel @xmath9 to describe how the wave function @xmath10 has evolved from all states @xmath11 at the moment @xmath12 : @xmath13 and @xmath14e^{is}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 $ ] denotes all possible paths , @xmath16 @xmath17 is the action along a certain path , and @xmath18 is the corresponding lagrangian .    in calculation , the following two properties of the kernel are very useful . in quantum mechanics level , </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to the kernel comes from the paths that nearly make the action @xmath19 in an classical extremum @xmath20 [ 16 ] up to a normalizing factor , i.e. @xmath21if the @xmath22 in @xmath19 is a quadratic form . and due to the kinetic energy @xmath23 , few situations violate the quadratic requirement . </S>",
    "<S> although this simplification originally appeared only as a mathematical technique , it can also simplify our physical consideration evidently , which will be validated later .    </S>",
    "<S> another feature of kernel is that  _ </S>",
    "<S> amplitudes for events occurring in succession in time multiply_.  [ 16 ] . for two such succeeding events @xmath24 and @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath26    \\(i ) _ expressing ab effect in feynman integral with a singularity _ : we do the integral of kernel as usual for any lagrangian , and then evaluate the contribution from the singularity and its neighborhood . by virtue of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , we can perceive the removal of singularity as a succeeding event after the just finished integral . </S>",
    "<S> this is equal to the case that a particle walks backward along all the original paths near the singularity after the particle has already completed all the possible paths . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth we call this sort of walking backward as a * return * mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> so , in physical sense , the redundant integral performed around the singularity is removed not by subtracting but by multiplying another kernel . </S>",
    "<S> although the events are in successive order and the latter motion is along the same original paths , the integral over the position space should be written out using different variables for distinguishability . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27e^{i\\int\\nolimits_{t_b}^{t_c}l(q^{\\prime } , % \\dot q^{\\prime } ) { \\bf d}t}\\int [ { \\bf d}q]e^{i\\int\\nolimits_{t_a}^{t_b}l(q,% \\dot q){\\bf d}t }   \\nonumber \\\\ \\ & = & \\int [ { \\bf d}q][{\\bf d}q^{\\prime } ] e^{is+is^{\\prime } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the measure @xmath15 $ ] stands for all the paths and @xmath28 $ ] represents all the paths covering the neighborhood of the singularity , see graph 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it will be clear later that the action @xmath19 is associated with scattering calculation and @xmath29 associated with nonlocal effect .    in general , we are only concerned with the effect of singularity on the wave function in eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case we only need to evaluate the first kernel @xmath30e^{is^{\\prime } } $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> now suppose an ideal dimensional ( 2 + 1 ) situation in which a low energy electron is scattered by a neutron : a plane is predetermined and the magnetic moment of neutron is vertical to the plane . </S>",
    "<S> a general lagrangian has a simple form as @xmath31 @xmath32 , in which @xmath33 and @xmath34 are scalar and vector potential respectively . for neutron , we know @xmath35 and make @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> then it is straightforward to carry out the integral @xmath37 using the above - mentioned first property . </S>",
    "<S> but the result is not what we have expected for the singularity . in a plane with singularity , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution to the kernel ca nt be approximated using only one classical extremum of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the paths encompassing a singularity ca nt be topologically invariably shrunk to one classical path . </S>",
    "<S> this point will be clearer with the consideration of gauge fixing condition_. _ using the above mentioned @xmath39 we may get @xmath40_{\\text{left}}+[{\\bf d}q^{\\prime } ] _ { \\text{% right}})e^{is_{cl}^{\\prime } } \\sim e^{is_{cl}^{\\text{left}}}+e^{is_{cl}^{% \\text{right}}}\\text{.}\\ ] ] in the integral of action @xmath41 , the second term @xmath42 can just afford the phase difference @xmath43 required by ab - effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , there yet left the first term to be treated in consistency . by a similar process , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the momentum , and thus the phase difference is @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is differential area element ) , which actually vanishes when the momentum is constant . </S>",
    "<S> obviously when a momentum is split into two on one side and merge on another side of the singularity , the direction of momenta along the two paths will change . using the method of difference </S>",
    "<S> , we can prove that @xmath48 is non - vanishing ( graph 2 ) , so is the nontrivial difference . </S>",
    "<S> this difference from @xmath49 is expected to be responsible for the phase shift due to diffraction , which should be held even when the interaction @xmath50 is absent . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of scalar potential @xmath33 can be included ( neutron replaced by proton ) without affecting the above result since it is path - independent .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) _ generalizing the expression of nonlocality_. in order to generalize the expression , it is necessary to consider the gauge transformation @xmath51 , and gauge fixing condition , e.g. coulomb gauge @xmath52 . concerning the gauge transformation , since the scalar function @xmath53 can be arbitrarily determined </S>",
    "<S> , it can directly reduce the degree of freedom of @xmath54 by one . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the vector @xmath54 can directly be chosen as @xmath55 , and thus in a plane . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we know that any two - particle scattering must occur in a plane which ca nt be predetermined but actually exists . </S>",
    "<S> so as an effective choice ( equivalent way ) , make all the @xmath54 s are parallel to the scattering plane . </S>",
    "<S> so , the above assumption for ab effect that the scattering must happen in a plane can actually be removed . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , @xmath52 suggests that the vector @xmath54 behaves like a tangent of magnetic lines without divergence ; and hence form closed loops . to this end , the condition of ab - effect , in a plane and close loop , is automatically satisfied by two - particle scattering with regard to the gauge transformation and gauge fixing condition . </S>",
    "<S> these two constraints reduce the freedoms of vector @xmath56 from three to one , identical to the freedom along a loop . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the freedom for gauge transformation is the very nonlocal degree of the fermion .    on an alternative viewpoint , </S>",
    "<S> since the choice of function @xmath53 for the gauge transformation @xmath57 is arbitrary , @xmath54 can be replaced by @xmath58 at every point in a continuous manner . </S>",
    "<S> thus the discussion of @xmath54 also applies to @xmath58 , i.e. the @xmath58 is in the scattering plane with @xmath59 . a change of @xmath60 in @xmath54 transform the wave function @xmath61 to @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> . the movement will not be trivial if a singularity exists for it produces observable interference stripe of the ab - effect .    in qed </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb gauge is equivalent to the lorentz gauge @xmath63 , so the above argument _ can be extended to include scalar potential_. we do this at the cost of giving up the time arrow , and the  plane  in which scattering and diffraction occur is now a 3-dimensional  super plane  . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath59 becomes @xmath64 , accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the two constrains @xmath65 and @xmath66 will reduce the freedoms of @xmath67 from four to two . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the scattering considered here is automatically extended to the general cases of a two - fermion scattering .    to extend the above argument to field theory , let s write down the gauge condition in terms of faddeev and popov form </S>",
    "<S> [ 17 ] . in qed , </S>",
    "<S> the form is    @xmath68\\int [ d\\theta ] \\delta ( \\partial _ \\mu ( a^\\mu ) ^\\theta ) = 1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 $ ] is the jacobian @xmath70 which is independent of @xmath71 in abelian case , and hence gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) is demanded to be gauge invariant , so the gauge invariance of @xmath72\\delta ( \\partial _ \\mu ( a^\\mu ) ^\\theta ) $ ] automatically restores the result @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge condition @xmath74 can be controlled in experiments by specifying the final outcome , but the resultant path of @xmath75 is a pure gauge property that ca nt be fixed by using local experiments , i.e. the function @xmath53 ca nt be determined locally . </S>",
    "<S> if considering the integral for the grassman variables @xmath76 , @xmath77det@xmath5 [ 18 ] , @xmath69 $ ] in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) can be expressed using degree [ 18 ] of freedom of the ghost as @xmath78[{\\cal d}c]e^{i\\int d^4x\\,\\bar c(x)\\box c(x)}\\ ] ] in the case of qed the above integral only contains dynamical term that can be absorbed into normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> we reserve its explicit form here to see clearly that the freedom of ghosts ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) is just the nonlocal degree of freedom . and </S>",
    "<S> the degree of freedom of an electron is 4 , larger than the ghosts .    from amplitude @xmath81 it is straightforward to extend the above discussion to field theory . </S>",
    "<S> notice the form of eq.(1 ) and the expansion property of quantum mechanics @xmath82 , every element of the s - matrix can be written as    @xmath83    now the integral measurement should be replaced by the fermion and boson fields instead of configuration space . for qed , @xmath84 has the form @xmath85[{\\cal d}{\\em \\psi } ] [ { \\cal d}{\\em a}]e^{is}$ ] , where the lagrangian in @xmath19 now becomes @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> a gauge - invariant lagrangian made by imposing gauge fixing condition and adding the ghost [ 19 , 20 ] has a general form @xmath89 a lagrangian with ghost field is convenient to do brst transformation to get identities used in renormalization . here </S>",
    "<S> we skip the details along this context . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the term @xmath90 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) and the term @xmath91 in eq.(8 ) are both responsible for gauge invariance after the gauge fixing term having been added [ 19 ] . comparing the freedom of @xmath92 and ghost field @xmath93 , it is found that the ghost degree is very the nonlocal degree . in qed , this degree of freedom is 2 , one for scalar , one for vector .    </S>",
    "<S> the above formulae can be further extended to the non - abelian case ( e.g. qcd ) by only changing @xmath94 and @xmath95 to @xmath96 and @xmath97 , in which the @xmath98 is the generator of the gauge group and @xmath99 is the corresponding structure constant . </S>",
    "<S> the terms in lagrangian of @xmath100 is the same as @xmath101 ; however , the integral measurement should be independent . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at the neighborhood of singularity , the fermion wave function and thus the fermion field should vanish . here </S>",
    "<S> let s again concentrate on the degree of freedom for nonlocality .    for non - abelian field , eq.(8 ) </S>",
    "<S> should be changed to @xmath102\\delta ( g(a^\\alpha ) ) \\text{det}(\\frac{\\delta g(a^\\alpha ) } { % \\delta \\alpha } ) = 1\\text{,}\\ ] ] in which the jacobian det@xmath103 is related to @xmath104 and ca nt be taken out of the integral as @xmath105 $ ] in qed . for qcd , </S>",
    "<S> the gauge transformation is @xmath106 from this expression we can get the analogous result of qed in lorentz gauge : @xmath107 similarly eq.(10 ) takes the form : @xmath108[{\\cal d}{\\it c}]e^{i\\int d^4x\\,\\bar c(x)(-\\partial ^\\mu d_\\mu ) c(x)}\\ ] ] accordingly gauge - invariant lagrangian becomes [ 18 ] @xmath109 the fact that the degrees of the ghost fields are responsible for the nonlocal degrees is directly extended from qed . in qcd , the degree of freedom for ghost fields is 16 . here </S>",
    "<S> the discussion of nonlocality is more complex for the ghost fields are coupled with the vector field , which is one of the main features in non - abelian field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between the wilson loop and berry phase [ 21 ] belongs to 2-dimensional out of 4-dimension case of the spatial degrees . </S>",
    "<S> and the degree of quarks here is @xmath110 , smaller than @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> it may be of this reason that quarks are confined .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) _ new hamiltonian_. </S>",
    "<S> let s start from the eq.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the two lagrangians in actions @xmath19 and @xmath29 have the same forms , the same integrand will certainly induce the same integral resultant function , in which only boundary values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are different . for example , if resultant function is @xmath114 and @xmath115 , then for the first action , @xmath116 , and for the second , @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> to finish the integral of [ @xmath118 and [ @xmath119 , let s divide the time interval into many parts as , @xmath120\\sim [ t_1,t_2,\\cdots , t_l,\\cdots , t_m,\\cdots , t_n]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> then the integral measurement [ @xmath118 changes with the time division to @xmath121=dq_2dq_3\\cdots dq_l\\cdots dq_m\\cdots dq_{n-1}$ ] . for the division of @xmath122 $ ] </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the intervals of time so coincident with the time interval between the @xmath123 $ ] as to reflect the * return * mechanism : if @xmath124\\sim [ t_1^{\\prime } , t_2^{\\prime } , \\cdots , t_n^{\\prime } ] $ ] , then make @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , which means @xmath130=dq_{m-1}dq_{m-2}\\cdots dq_{l+1}$ ] . and </S>",
    "<S> thus applying the second property of feynman integral and multiplying every integral results together yield @xmath131[{\\bf d}q^{\\prime } ] e^{is+is^{\\prime } }   \\nonumber \\\\ \\ & = & \\int dq_2dq_3\\cdots dq_l\\cdots dq_m\\cdots dq_{n-1}e^{i(s_{12}+s_{23}+\\cdots + s_{n-1,n})}\\times   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ </S>",
    "<S> \\ \\int dq_{m-1}dq_{m-2}\\cdots dq_{l+1}e^{i(s_{m-1,m-2}+s_{m-2,m-3}+\\cdots + s_{l+2,l+1})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 represents the integral for action between @xmath133 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be noted that , according to the * return * mechanism and our design of division , @xmath134[for @xmath135@xmath136[for @xmath84]@xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> equally , if the integrand for @xmath139 is @xmath140(@xmath141 is a singularity region ) , then there will be no paths between the region @xmath142 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the paths that contribute nothing to the kernel will only add a factor @xmath143 to the kernel . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath144or @xmath145 and is absorbed in normalized factor . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the integral of eq.(18 ) has an equivalent expression , @xmath146[{\\bf d}q^{\\prime } ] e^{is+is^{\\prime } } = \\int [ { \\bf d}% q]e^{i(s - s_d)}=\\int [ { \\bf d}q]e^{i\\int ( { \\frak l}-{\\frak l}^{\\prime } ) dt}\\ ] ] now the integral measurement is over all the region of space , and @xmath147 is the part which is nontrivial only in singular region . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis applies equal to quantum fields : changing the integral measurement and extending the variables in @xmath148 and @xmath149 directly to fields quantities , and make fermion fields vanish at the singularity point correspondingly .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.(11 ) suggests that future calculations may consist of two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , we calculate the scattering amplitude @xmath84 as usually done ; then , we consider the @xmath100 to include nonlocal effect . to calculate the correction of higher order than the tree level , then , the amplitude @xmath84 and @xmath150 have to be considered together . for the case of ultraviolet divergence in qed and the infrared behavior in qcd , the  * return *  region for @xmath151 may just be the forbidden region for @xmath84 , whose contribution should be cut off for its non - physical meaning . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , we make the lagrangian in @xmath147 as the counter terms for that in action @xmath19 in @xmath101 , and the lagrangian has the same form as that in @xmath19 with only some renormalization constants multiplied to the corresponding terms . </S>",
    "<S> the new lagrangian means a new hamiltonian , which contributes only to nonlocal phase as in berry phase , and does nt contribute to the transitional amptitude . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization and the nonlocality have been unified to an expression .    here </S>",
    "<S> we will not reiterate the lengthy procedure of renormalization calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to recognized that the cutoff for renormalizationare determined by the nonlocal region which we are really concerned . knowing the geometry of this region can enable us to distinguish what is physical from what is non - physical , and justify the effective region that renormaliztion group can be properly used . using the relation @xmath152 can only get a rough estimation in purterbative situation . </S>",
    "<S> further investigations on this issue are under way .    in above argument </S>",
    "<S> we have employed the case that electrons(or protons , as in ref [ 13 ] ) are scattered by neutron , but with the generalized formulae , there is no constraints for the involved particles . </S>",
    "<S> the argument can be readily extended to any scattering of two particles that carry both flux and charge[14 , _ commence ( i ) _ ] .    in summary , in this paper we argue that any scattering process must be accompanied by the nonlocal effect which may induce resultant observables . and it is also achieved that the degree of freedom of nonlocality is equivalent to the degree of the ghost field , and also the gauge degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of the renormalization along this context is also sketched . </S>",
    "<S> though having been unified in the same path integral frame , the nonlocality ( diffraction or ab - effect ) is really different from the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the former is sensitive to measurement and thus unobservable locally , but the latter can be detected anyway . </S>",
    "<S> now the dissertation can be unified using the gauge transformation even in higher - dimension unitary space . </S>"
