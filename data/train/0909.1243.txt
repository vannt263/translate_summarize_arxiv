    "einstein s famous elevator / rocket thought experiment unambiguously connects energy - momentum to space - time curvature as the expression of gravity , and leads to the einstein equation[1 ] .",
    "the a piori separation of space - time and energy - momentum was not to einstein s liking , despite the profound success of general relativity , and some deeper connection between the two may exist[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ] . in this light , and as a follow - up to [ 5 ] , quantum aspects are considered .",
    "the energy momentum tensor is an observable quantity .",
    "quantum - mechanically , this implies that it may be impacted by interaction with an observer .",
    "indeed , the place , @xmath3 , and momentum , @xmath4 , operators for some field @xmath1 in the energy - momentum tensor allow one to assign field values and the changes therein , but @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not commute .",
    "in fact , an observer that measures a field in the energy - momentum tensor ( through @xmath5 ) also changes it ( so acts with @xmath6 ) . through the einstein equation",
    "this change propagates into space - time , which causes a secondary change ( through @xmath6 again ) .",
    "it is this back - reaction that the observer should actually measure ( through @xmath5 again ) .",
    "this leads to a `` measurement '' operator @xmath7 that acts on any field in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the influence of the observer may seem small , _ but _ in reality any system observes itself unremittingly .    if implemented , @xmath8 would be a significant modification of einstein gravity .",
    "of course , one can argue that the measurement argument has no merit because the observer and observed parts of the gravitational system are assumed to be distinct entities in the first place .",
    "this very distinction , as an observable fact , implies that the action of the operator @xmath8 must be the identity .",
    "this is quite true .",
    "however , the distinction between observer and observed parts of the gravitational system can be made using _ only _ non - gravitational information .",
    "that is , irrespective of gravitational forces and , say , through exchange of information carried by light , the entanglement of an observer and a system part can be affected[9 ] .",
    "consequently , @xmath8 does act if there is a difference between the non - gravitational and gravitational information that is necessary to describe the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "therefore , one finds an operator @xmath9^p$ ] with @xmath10 when a field @xmath1 is relevant to both gravitational and non - gravitational processes ( @xmath9^p$ ] is just the identity then ) and @xmath11 when this is not the case .",
    "einstein gravity , for newton s constant @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 in the usual notation .",
    "typically , @xmath14 , with density @xmath15 , pressure @xmath16 and four - velocity @xmath17 .",
    "semi - classically , one can just transform a classical field @xmath1 in @xmath18 to @xmath9^px$ ] .",
    "e.g. , under @xmath8 one has eigenvalues 2 and 6 in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , yielding @xmath21 .",
    "this specific @xmath11 case pertains to a collisionless fluid , since in the absence of collisions no non - gravitational information on pressure and velocity is needed , and only density is required for the non - gravitational aspects of the system to be tangible . for pure dust the pressure is zero and one finds a factor 6 increase in the strength of gravity .",
    "interestingly , this is equivalent to the 5 times more dark matter than baryonic matter that is needed to describe the dynamics of ( almost collisionless ) stellar systems like galaxies[5 ] . for systems that are partially collisionless ( e.g. , due to stellar collisions or gas hydrodynamics ) ,",
    "the discrete variable @xmath22 varies with position depending on the local gravitational and non - gravitational information needed .",
    "interestingly , below a redshift of @xmath23 fewer galaxies merge and most stars are in place , and the universe as a whole is relatively quiet .",
    "so more recently than redshift @xmath23 processes that need mostly gravitational information occur less frequently , by a factor of more than a few looking at the mass accumulation history of galaxies , compared to those that require gravitational and non - gravitational information ( like the evolution of stars and diffuse matter ) .",
    "this favors @xmath10 for the global matter distribution of the universe since a redshift of @xmath23 , compared to @xmath11 for earlier times , and leads to an acceleration in cosmic expansion ( dark energy behavior ) .",
    "the operator @xmath9^p$ ] , when applied to individual particle excitations of an underlying field like density , should act exactly the same and weigh deviations in the required gravitational versus non - gravitational information of contributing particles .",
    "the sun is obviously a collisionally dominated system and @xmath9^p=1 $ ] .",
    "however , through particle interactions , the fusion cycle that powers the sun causes our star to loose mass and @xmath24 for a starting mass @xmath25 in the classical limit .",
    "the @xmath26 term represents any extra gravitational information that is needed and follows from @xmath18 . for negligible pressure , @xmath27 , i.e. , 2 from @xmath15 times 6 from @xmath28 because now the non - gravitational information on _ changes _ due to the fusion cycle resides with individual particles only , independent of their mass density and four - velocity .",
    "in fact , one expects @xmath29 since 3 particles are removed for every produced @xmath30he in the dominant fusion cycle of the sun .",
    "this extra factor three is a pure particle effect not captured by the field description of @xmath9^p$ ] . in all",
    ", this translates into a correction of @xmath31 to @xmath32 , which can be viewed as an information dependent change in the gravitational constant[5 ] .",
    "therefore , the astronomical unit au increases by @xmath33 due to the astronomical definition @xmath34[10 ] , with @xmath35 gauss constant",
    ". this yields @xmath36 cm / yr , close to what appears to be observed[10 ] .",
