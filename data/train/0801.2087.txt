    "<S> we present a study of the magnetic susceptibility  of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  single crystals in a doping range @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our data shows a pronounced magnetic anisotropy for all compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy is in agreement with a low - spin ground state ( @xmath4 ) of co@xmath5 for @xmath6 and a high - spin ground state ( @xmath7 ) of co@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our data with a crystal - field model calculation assuming local moments and find a good description of the magnetic behavior for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the pronounced kinks observed in the inverse magnetic susceptibility , which result from the anisotropy and low - energy excited states of co@xmath8 and are not related to magnetic ordering or temperature - dependent spin - state transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> transition - metal oxides are known for their complex interplay between different degrees of freedom like spin , charge and orbitals . in some of these systems </S>",
    "<S> another interesting property is found : ions like co@xmath5 in a crystal - field environment can occur in different spin states . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , transitions between different spin states are possible for some compounds . a prominent example showing this phenomenon is lacoo@xmath10 , which has been examined and discussed since the middle of the last century ( see e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of different spin states arises from the competition between crystal - field effects and on - site coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> crystal fields lift the degeneracy of the @xmath11 states . </S>",
    "<S> if the crystal field is strong , this can lead to a violation of hund s rules . in the case of cubic symmetry and in a one - electron picture , the five - fold degenerate @xmath11 states are split into a three - fold degenerate @xmath12and a two - fold degenerate @xmath13  level . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting between @xmath12and @xmath13  states is called @xmath14 . with a strong crystal field , </S>",
    "<S> the electrons will be forced into the low - spin state ( ls ) . regarding a @xmath15 system , this state consists of an antiparallel alignment of spins with @xmath16  and @xmath4 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction manifests itself in the effect of hund s coupling . </S>",
    "<S> a parallel arrangement of spins minimizes the electron - electron repulsion because the pauli principle forces the electrons to occupy different orbitals . in a weak cubic crystal field </S>",
    "<S> , this effect will dominate and lead to the high - spin state ( hs ) , which is the configuration with the highest total spin possible in accordance with the pauli principle . for a @xmath15 system , this configuration is @xmath17  with @xmath18 . for co@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> the crossover between these two different spin states occurs roughly at an energy difference of @xmath19ev .    in the case of lacoo@xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> a low - spin ground state for co@xmath5 was found@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the difference between the crystal field energies and the promotional energies is so small that an excited state with different spin state can be reached by thermal excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this excited state has been a subject of debate for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the hs state described above , the intermediate - spin state ( is , @xmath20  @xmath21 ) was also discussed@xcite and reported in many experiments , but it was shown that it might have been confused with a spin - orbit coupled hs state@xcite .    for the layered cobaltates </S>",
    "<S> la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 , much less is known about the spin state of co@xmath5 . based on magnetic </S>",
    "<S> measurements@xcite a hs ground state for @xmath22 and a spin - state transition to an is ground state for @xmath23 was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion was based on a curie - weiss analysis of the susceptibility  in a temperature range of 100k to 300k and nmr measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unrestricted hartree - fock calculations@xcite showed a slightly different picture . here , three different magnetic phases were found . </S>",
    "<S> an antiferromagnetic hs phase ( @xmath24 ) , a ferromagnetic hs phase ( @xmath25 ) and an antiferromagnetic ls - hs - ordered phase ( @xmath26 ) were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations were also based on the results of the curie - weiss analysis in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . taking into account </S>",
    "<S> that la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  is an anisotropic material with rather strong spin - orbit coupling compared to the tetragonal crystal field splitting , the validity of the curie - weiss law is questionable . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to analyze the magnetic susceptibility  from a different perspective , concentrating on the spin state of co@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the single crystals used for the magnetic measurements have been grown using the floating - zone technique in an image furnace . </S>",
    "<S> a strontium doping range of @xmath27 was covered . </S>",
    "<S> resistivity measurements revealed that la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  is a strong insulator for all sr doping concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath28 sample turned out to possess the highest resistivity , which is in accordance with the charge ordering of co@xmath8 and co@xmath5 at @xmath29k that has already been reported@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization was measured with a quantum design vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the field was aligned parallel to the coo@xmath30 planes as well as perpendicular to these planes ( the crystallographic @xmath31 direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding components @xmath32  and @xmath33  are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chi ] . </S>",
    "<S> a short - range antiferromagnetic order has been found in the compounds @xmath34 by neutron measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this frustrated short - range order is also reflected by the difference between field cooled ( fc ) and zero - field cooled ( zfc ) measurements at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility  is smaller for zfc than fc below a certain freezing temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  for two different directions of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the insert is an expanded view of the low - temperature region to show the difference between fc and zfc measurements for @xmath35 . the curves with the lower susceptibility  refer to the zfc measurements . </S>",
    "<S> ]    figure [ fig : sus ] shows the inverse magnetic susceptibility  for both orientations of field . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of the susceptibility  in the paramagnetic regime is the pronounced magnetic anisotropy , both in magnitude and form of the curves . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the anisotropy is the same for all crystals , finding @xmath32  to be bigger than @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  for two different directions of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the curves and the magnetic anisotropy strongly deviates from curie - weiss behavior . ]    here , the magnetic anisotropy arises from band structure and spin - orbit coupling . for mott and charge - transfer insulators with well - localized moments , </S>",
    "<S> band - structure and covalency effects can be approximated by an effective crystal field . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal field reflects the anisotropy of the lattice and lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath11 states , resulting in a new set of linear combinations of the unperturbed wave functions as a basis . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation values of the components of the orbital moment result from these new linear combinations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the crystal s anisotropy may result in an anisotropy of the orbital moment . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit coupling ties the spin moment to this anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian will be written as @xmath36 where the sum over @xmath37 runs over all electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the dot product between spin and orbital momentum tends to align these moments antiparallel for each electron . for an anisotropic orbital momentum , </S>",
    "<S> the spin is aligned in the direction of maximum orbital momentum@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the full many - body ground - state for a @xmath38 or @xmath39 configuration in a crystal - field calculation including spin - orbit coupling and a tetragonal distortions is not simple @xcite but well known . in order to get </S>",
    "<S> an intuitive picture one would like to fall back to a single electron description . in the limit of full spin polarization </S>",
    "<S> this can be done and gives important results . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will first discuss the magnetic anisotropy of la@xmath0sr@xmath40coo@xmath41 in terms of a one - electron picture . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that each spin state has a different magnetic anisotropy from which , by comparison to the experiment , the spin states of the co ion can be concluded . in order to obtain also a quantitative description and to verify our simple argumentation we will present a full many - body crystal - field calculation afterwards .    </S>",
    "<S> within a cubic crystal structure , the @xmath11 states split into @xmath13  orbitals and @xmath12  orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the basis can be chosen as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a partially filled @xmath12  shell can produce a pseudo orbital moment of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> though the individual real wave functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the basis themselves have a completely quenched orbital moment , their linear combinations are in general complex . writing @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 as the orbital wave function with the orbital moment quantized along the axes @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , one finds    @xmath54    in the limit of very large crystal field splittings @xmath14 and with a partially filled @xmath12  shell , the moment is isotropic , despite the large orbital moment . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath12  electrons are sometimes compared to @xmath55 electrons@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> introducing a tetragonal distortion , the orbital moment becomes anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonal crystal field splits the cubic @xmath13  states into non - degenerate @xmath56 and @xmath57 levels , while the @xmath12  states split into a non - degenerate @xmath58 state and a two - fold degenerate @xmath59 level . as a basis for these states , </S>",
    "<S> the real orbital functions can also be used . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath53 axis of the system is taken to be identical with the @xmath31 axis of the crystal . in the case of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen octahedron is elongated in the @xmath31 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the order of levels and occupations for the ground states of the two cobalt ions is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : occ ] .     levels in a tetragonal crystal field arising from an elongated oxygen octahedron . </S>",
    "<S> the two sketches on the left show the occupation for the ls and hs state of co@xmath5 in a one - electron picture . </S>",
    "<S> the right sketch refers to hs co@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the real orbitals on the right can be used as a basis.,width=377 ]    the co@xmath5 low - spin state is , except for a small van vleck susceptibility , nonmagnetic since it does not carry any moment . in the high - spin state , co@xmath5 has spin and orbital moment . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital degeneracy is not completely quenched : the degenerate @xmath60 and @xmath61 are occupied by three electrons . </S>",
    "<S> these real orbitals can thus be recombined to form complex orbitals carrying orbital moment in the @xmath53 direction as described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : co3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the linear combinations in equations ( [ eq : co21 ] ) and ( [ eq : co22 ] ) can not be formed because the @xmath62 orbital is not degenerate with the @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the orbital moment is larger in the @xmath53 direction making this the easy axis . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy should be reflected in the susceptibility  with @xmath33@xmath63@xmath32 , which obviously contradicts the anisotropy found in the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a co@xmath5 hs system shows the wrong magnetic anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss the is state of co@xmath5 . due to the elongation of the oxygen octahedra , the @xmath13  electron occupies the @xmath64 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> this also effects the splitting of the @xmath12  states . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals remain degenerate but are not degenerate with the @xmath62 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the different charge distributions in relation to the @xmath64 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> we have five electrons to fill in the @xmath12  states , which can also be treated as one hole in the @xmath12  states . </S>",
    "<S> this hole is attracted to the @xmath13  electron in the @xmath64 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : is ] shows the charge distribution of this hole and the @xmath64 orbital . in the left sketch , both </S>",
    "<S> the electron in the @xmath64 orbital and a hole in the @xmath62 orbital is drawn . </S>",
    "<S> the sketch in the center shows the @xmath64 orbital and the hole in a linear combination of the degenerate @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the distances between the electron and the hole , on can conclude that the state with the hole in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals is lower in energy . as the order of levels is reversed when we are speaking about holes instead of electrons , </S>",
    "<S> this means that the @xmath62 orbital is lowered in energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the order and occupation of levels is the one shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : is ] . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic anisotropy is the same as in the case of co@xmath5 hs which we treated in the last paragraph . with three electrons in the degenerate level of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals </S>",
    "<S> , we can also make use of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : co3 ] ) to show that the direction of anisotropy does not fit the measurements for la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 .    neither the hs nor the is state of co@xmath5 show the correct magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> but before we draw further conclusions , co@xmath8 should be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> although co@xmath8 has also been found in the ls state in some intramolecular compounds@xcite , for bulk crystals it can be safely assumed that co@xmath8 is in the hs state@xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> orbital ( black ) and a hole in the @xmath62 orbital ( white ) . </S>",
    "<S> the charge distribution in the center refers to an electron in the @xmath65 orbital and a hole in a linear combination of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting and the occupation of the @xmath11 levels for co@xmath5 in the is state is shown on the right.,width=404 ]    regarding the ground state produced by the crystal field in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : occ ] , where the lowest level is filled , no linear combinations like in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : co3 ] ) can be formed . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital moment would be completely quenched and the magnetic moment would be determined by an isotropic spin . if , however , spin - orbit coupling is of the same magnitude as the splitting of the @xmath12  orbitals , it will mix these states . mixing in a state with orbital moment in the @xmath53 direction would require placing a hole in the @xmath66 orbital ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : co3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this would cost an energy equal to the splitting within the @xmath12  orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> it is more favorable to mix in a state with orbital moment in the @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) direction by placing a hole in the @xmath67 ( or the @xmath68 ) orbital ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : co21 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this costs only half of the crystal - field splitting within the @xmath12  orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> an orbital moment in the @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) direction costs less energy than in the @xmath53 direction . </S>",
    "<S> so , the @xmath62 plane will be the easy plane for co@xmath8 in this elongated tetragonal structure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin moment will also be found in the @xmath62 plane . comparing these findings to the measurement , </S>",
    "<S> we see that co@xmath8 shows the correct direction of magnetic anisotropy . now </S>",
    "<S> a conclusion about the spin state of co@xmath5 can be drawn . for @xmath9 , at least half of the cobalt ions in the crystal are co@xmath5 . taking into account that co@xmath8 has a smaller spin moment than hs co@xmath5 , the latter would dominate the anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the opposite is , however , the case in the data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for this doping range , the spin state of co@xmath5 is identified with the ls state and the magnetization must be assigned to co@xmath8 , which shows the correct anisotropy . for @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> , we still have 40% co@xmath5 and , because of the pronounced anisotropy , we can follow the same argumentation here . regarding @xmath70 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sus ] , the anisotropy is found to be rather small compared to the other compounds .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the direction of anisotropy in layered perovskites depends on the direction in which the oxygen octahedron is distorted . in some systems like k@xmath30cof@xmath2 the octahedra </S>",
    "<S> are compressed in the @xmath31 direction , resulting in an easy - axis anisotropy@xcite ; co@xmath8 in almost cubic symmetry also tends to have an easy - axis anisotropy like in coo . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our case of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 , the oxygen octahedron surrounding the cobalt ion is elongated by the inherent tetragonal structure . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is comparable to the change of anisotropy in coo films on different substrates@xcite .    for a quantitative analysis of the data and a confirmation of the results found in the qualitative discussion of the anisotropy , </S>",
    "<S> a full - multiplet calculation was carried out within the crystal field approximation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a hamiltonian for the @xmath11 shell of the co@xmath8 ion was set up , including crystal field , spin - orbit coupling and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the slater integrals @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 characterizing the coulomb interaction and the spin - orbit coupling constant were taken from a hartree - fock approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any excitations from the oxygen @xmath74 levels and mixing with higher states were neglected , as these effects are not significant when considering thermal energies . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters for the crystal field were treated semi - empirically . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the tetragonal distortion as a perturbation of the cubic symmetry , the effect of the hybridization of the co @xmath11 shell with the surrounding oxygen @xmath74 shells only increases the splitting of the cubic @xmath12  and @xmath13  states . </S>",
    "<S> hybridization can thus be included into the crystal field parameters and need not be treated separately . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian was diagonalized and eigenstates and eigenvalues were used to obtain the temperature dependence of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic exchange was included in the calculation on a mean - field level . </S>",
    "<S> the results can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fit ] , where the inverse magnetization is plotted .     </S>",
    "<S> ( black lines ) , plotted inverse . </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field magnetic exchange was added to the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> note that the magnetization of the ion was weighted with the content of co@xmath8 ( @xmath75 ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the crystal - field parameters were chosen as follows : the @xmath14 splitting and the splitting within the @xmath13  levels were fixed at 1.5ev and 0.2ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these two values are of minor importance for the calculation , because the anisotropy of the magnetization arises from the @xmath12  electrons , as described in the discussion above . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the @xmath12  states showed up to be crucial for the form and the anisotropy of the calculated curves . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the splitting within the @xmath12  states were chosen as 80mev , 60mev , 68mev , and 50mev for the compounds </S>",
    "<S> @xmath760.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , and 0.8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath12 crystal field splittings for co are in good agreement with previous measurements on strained coo thin films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they might appear to be surprisingly small compared to the values found for the titanates @xcite in the order of 200 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between co and ti can be understood by considering the radial extent of the @xmath77 wave function and the transition metal - oxygen ( tm - o ) distance . </S>",
    "<S> the co @xmath77 wave function is much smaller than the ti @xmath77 wave function , reducing the covalency and thereby the size of the crystal - field splitting . at the same time , the average tm - o distances of la@xmath0sr@xmath40coo@xmath41 and latio@xmath78 are almost equal ( @xmath792.02  for co - o @xcite and @xmath792.04  for ti - o @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the occupation of the anti - bonding @xmath13 orbitals in a hs co@xmath8 compound which pushes the o atoms further away .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fit ] that the calculation gives a good description for @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of the half - doped sample @xmath28 is reproduced well for higher temperatures . at temperatures below the freezing temperature </S>",
    "<S> , the calculation can not describe the system because magnetic order is not included in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath82 sample is fitted well for lower temperatures . above @xmath83k , the magnetization in the measurement </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced by another effect and results in a deviation from the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be seen in all curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sus ] , but at significantly higher temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this increase of magnetization could arise from the thermal population of the co@xmath5 hs or is state . </S>",
    "<S> but surely further measurements at higher temperatures are needed to confirm this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the full - multiplet calculation of a pure co@xmath8 system already succeeds in describing the main features of the magnetization for @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that co@xmath5 is a ls system in this doping range .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic susceptibility  of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  has been analyzed for two different directions of the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> a definite anisotropy of the magnetic moment is found experimentally with @xmath32@xmath63@xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this direction of anisotropy does not match with the behavior of hs or is co@xmath5 , whereas co@xmath8 in the hs state shows the correct single - ion anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spin state of co@xmath5 for @xmath85 must be the ls state . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is also confirmed by a full - multiplet calculation .    </S>",
