    "we consider the problem of factorization of permutations . we begin with a discussion of some simple mathematical ideas behind a matching game known as amidakuji concerning the assignment of @xmath0 jobs to @xmath0 people .",
    "it is shown that the ideas are related to the study of other topics including sorting algorithms in computer science , permutations in abstract algebra , and research in genomics . in section 2 ,",
    "we extend the ideas to obtain new results and discuss new problems on factorization of permutations into special type of transpositions .",
    "amidakuji , also known as ghost leg drawing , is a matching game ( with a certain degree of randomness ) for creating a one - one correspondence between @xmath0 people and @xmath0 jobs , or between @xmath0 boys and @xmath0 girls .",
    "this game is quite popular in asian regions ( japan , korea , hong kong , taiwan ) , and has even been created into an iphone app .",
    "@xcite .    to do the matching ,",
    "one draws @xmath0 vertical lines connecting persons @xmath1 to jobs @xmath2 , which yields the natural assignment that @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "one then randomly adds some horizontal line segments between any pair of adjacent vertical lines so that no two horizontal line segments meet .",
    "now , @xmath3 will find their job assignment by going down the @xmath6th vertical line and making a turn ( to left , right , or going down ) whenever an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line segments is encountered .",
    "this will set up a one - one correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one can see the example in figure 1 ( from @xcite ) below .",
    "first time players are often amazed by the fact that the procedure always leads to a one - one correspondence between @xmath0 people and @xmath0 jobs .",
    "that is , at the end of the game , no two people will be assigned the same job . also , it is natural to ask whether one can get all possible job assignments , and how to draw the horizontal lines to arrange the specific job assignment .",
    "we list several natural questions in the following .    1 .",
    "why do we always get a one - one correspondence ?",
    "is it possible to get every possible job assignments ? 3 .",
    "what is the minimum number of horizontal lines one has to add to achieve a certain specific job assignment ? 4 .",
    "what is the job assignment so that the minimum number of horizontal lines needed for the assignment is maximum ?    the answer of question 1 is easy if one approaches it in the `` right '' way .",
    "one can interpret the procedure as follows .",
    "the people @xmath1 sit in a row of chairs labeled by @xmath2 . adding a line segment corresponds to switching an adjacent pair of people .",
    "of course , no matter how many horizontal line segments are added , @xmath0 people will still occupy the @xmath0 seats without any conflicts .",
    "formally , one can prove the result by induction on the number of horizontal line segments .",
    "if there is no horizontal line segment , clearly one has a one - one correspondence between the people and jobs .",
    "suppose @xmath7 horizontal line segments will give rise to a one - one correspondence .",
    "then adding one more line segment will only add an additional switch of the job assignment of an adjacent pair of people .    using the above interpretation",
    ", one can readily answer questions 2  4 .",
    "we can represent the original sitting arrangement by @xmath8 $ ] and the final sitting arrangement by @xmath9 $ ] , which is referred to as a _ permutation _ of @xmath10",
    "we can always restore the order of @xmath9 $ ] by doing the following . survey the list from left to right , whenever we encounter two consecutive number so that the left one is larger than the right one , we switch the two numbers .",
    "we * claim * that after a number of such switches , one will not see any pair of consecutive terms such that the left number is larger than the right one .",
    "then the permutation must be @xmath10 $ ] at that stage . reversing the above switching steps",
    ", we will generate the permutation @xmath9 $ ] from @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "hence , we can generate any permutation if we can prove our * claim*. to this end , we define the number of inversions of a permutation @xmath9 $ ] as the sum of the numbers inv@xmath12 , where inv@xmath12 is the numbers of integers smaller than @xmath6 lying on the right side of @xmath6 in @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "for example , the number of inversions in @xmath13 $ ] is @xmath14 .",
    "note that if we exchange two consecutive numbers we either increase or decrease the inversion numbers by @xmath15 or @xmath16 depending on whether the left number is smaller or larger .",
    "thus , each step of our proposed scheme will reduce the number of inversions by 1 . as a result , after a number of steps ( equal to the number of inversions ) , we will have no more inversions .",
    "* figure 1 *    the above analysis does not only show that one can get all permutations of @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "it also tells us the minimum number of switches needed to get to a special permutation @xmath9 $ ] , namely , the number of inversions in the permutation .",
    "now , it is clear that the permutation with the maximum number of inversions is @xmath18 $ ] requiring @xmath19 switches .",
    "so , we have the answers for questions 2  4 .      * sorting algorithm *    it is easy to see that the mathematical idea behind the amidakuji game can be used to determine the number of steps required to restore the order of a permutation @xmath9 $ ] under the restriction that one can only switch two consecutive numbers in each step .",
    "in fact , this is the well known bubble sort algorithm in computer science study ; see @xcite and its references .",
    "the basic idea is : to restore a permutation @xmath9 $ ] to the identity permutation @xmath17 $ ] by exchanging a consecutive pair of numbers in each step , the minimum number of steps needed is the number of inversions in @xmath9 $ ] . as long as one exchanges a pair of numbers @xmath20 for @xmath21 in each step to reduce the total number of inversions in the permutation , the procedure will bring @xmath9 $ ] to @xmath17 $ ] in the minimum number of steps .",
    "there are many other efficient sorting algorithms .",
    "we refer the readers to the excellent reference @xcite for more details .",
    "* genome rearrangements *    it turns out that the study is related to the study of genome rearrangement . in nature , some species have similar genetic make up and differ only in the order of their genes . finding the shortest rearrangement path between two related bacteria or viruses is useful in drug discovery and vaccine development .",
    "the study is also useful in the study of mutations . in fact , a slight change of the genetic sequence may have significant effect , and it is more likely to see a change ( permutation ) of the positions of the nucleotides close to each other in the genetic sequences .",
    "that is why there are keen interest in studying such permutations in genetic sequences ; for example , see @xcite and their references .",
    "* group theory and cayley graph *    the problem is clearly related to the study of group theory and cayley graph in abstract algebra .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the set of permutations of @xmath10 $ ] , i.e. , symmetric group of degree @xmath0 , and regard every permutation as a vertex .",
    "we connect two vertices @xmath23 and @xmath24 if @xmath25 for a permutation @xmath26 which exchanges two consecutive numbers at the @xmath27th and @xmath28st positions for some @xmath29 .",
    "then the bubble sort algorithm amounts to moving a permutation @xmath9 $ ] to @xmath17 $ ] in the cayley graph most efficiently ( using the minimum number of steps ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 is the maximum distance from @xmath17 $ ] to another permutation @xmath9 $ ] , which is @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "one easily shows that the value @xmath30 is actually the maximum distance between any two vertices , and is known as the diameter of the cayley graph .",
    "it also indicates that a permutation is a product of no more than @xmath30 transpositions of the form @xmath32 .",
    "a more general version of the above problem is how to represent a permutation as a product of a minimal number of permutations selected from a certain set .",
    "the study has a long history , and attracted many authors ; see @xcite and their references .",
    "we will consider this type of problem in the next section .",
    "the study of this problem has a long history .",
    "d@xmath33nes @xcite determined that the minimum number is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of disjoint cycles in the given permutation on @xmath0 letters .",
    "other approaches have been used to get the minimum number in @xcite .",
    "later on , people found it natural and interesting to determine the number of minimal factorization of a permutation and the minimal product with factors from a given set of transpositions @xcite .    * graph algorithms *    graph algorithms concern the study of efficient computational methods in solving pure and applied problems which can be modeled using graph theory ; see @xcite and their references",
    ". formulating our problem in terms of the permutation group and cayley graph naturally lead to the use of graph algorithms to search the shortest path from a given permutation @xmath36 $ ] to the identity @xmath17 $ ] , and the search of the diameter of the cayley graph . in our study",
    ", we also develop some computer programs in our study ; see section 2.3 .",
    "in the following we consider a variation of the sorting algorithm , namely , in each step one can switch two numbers which are separated by fewer than @xmath7 numbers .",
    "in other words , we can switch @xmath37 and @xmath38 in @xmath9 $ ] as long as @xmath39 .",
    "we will see that it is more challenging to determine the minimum number of such moves to reduce a permutation to the identity permutation , and which permutation requires the maximum number of moves for the reduction .",
    "mathematically , for @xmath40 , let @xmath41 be the set of transpositions @xmath42 in @xmath22 with @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath41 generates @xmath22 , i.e. , every permutation in @xmath22 is a product of transpositions in @xmath41 .",
    "we are interested in finding the smallest number of transpositions in @xmath41 needed to convert a given permutation to the identity , and the permutation requires the maximum number of transposition to do the reduction .    in the context of cayley graph , one can construct the graph @xmath44 so that the vertices are permutations in @xmath22 , and two vertices @xmath23 and @xmath24 if @xmath45 .",
    "denote by * 1 * the identity permutation @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "we are interested in the shortest path joining the identity permutation @xmath46 to a given permutation @xmath47 .",
    "the length of this path is denoted by @xmath48 . also , we are interested in the permutation @xmath49 with a maximum distance to the identity @xmath46",
    ". clearly , the maximum distance will be the same as the maximum distance between any two vertices in the cayley graph , and we will denote this quantity by @xmath50 .",
    "the result in section 1 shows that @xmath51 .    in what follows",
    "we always use @xmath52 to specify that the transpositions are from @xmath41 .",
    "denote by @xmath53 the permutation @xmath54 such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 for other @xmath6 , which is referred to as a length @xmath35 cycle .",
    "also denote by @xmath57 the smallest integer greater than or equal to @xmath58 and @xmath59 the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the following lemma will be used frequently in our discussion .",
    "[ le1 ] let @xmath54 .",
    "a transposition in a cycle of @xmath47 splits the cycle into two disjoint cycles .",
    "a transposition between two disjoint cycles of @xmath47 joints the two cycles into one .    _ proof .",

    "then @xmath67and @xmath68 -.3 in _",
    "the result for @xmath69 was discussed in section 1 .",
    "the other extreme is when @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath41 is the set of all transpositions .",
    "we have the following known result , see @xcite . here give a short proof of it for completeness .",
    "[ 2.2 ] suppose @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72 , where @xmath35 is the number of cycles in the disjoint cycle representation of @xmath47 under the convention that each fixed point is counted as a 1-cycle .",
    "thus , @xmath73 is attained at a @xmath0-cycle .    _ proof .",
    "writing @xmath74 for a minimum number of transpositions @xmath75 is the same as finding the minimum number of transpositions @xmath76 such that @xmath77 . using lemma [ le1 ] , to convert @xmath47 to the product of @xmath0 disjoint cycles , i.e. , back to the identity permutation @xmath17 $ ] most efficiently by composing @xmath47 with transpositions , the most efficient way is to choose transposition @xmath42 in each step such that @xmath27 and @xmath6 lie in the same cycle .",
    "so , using @xmath78 transpositions @xmath79 to convert @xmath47 to the identity permutation will be the most efficient scheme .",
