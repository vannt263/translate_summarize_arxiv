    "the solar system is permanently exposed to a vast flux of highly energetic and fully ionized atomic nuclei , the cosmic rays .",
    "their energies extend from the gev range to at least @xmath0  ev . over a wide range",
    "the energy spectrum follows a power law @xmath1 . the spectral index changes around 4  pev from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "this transition phenomenon has been reported for the first time in 1958 @xcite and is commonly referred to as _ the knee_. a cutout of the energy spectrum in the knee region is depicted in .",
    "shown is the all - particle energy spectrum , which exhibits the knee , as well as results from direct measurements above the atmosphere for primary protons and iron nuclei .",
    "the origin of the knee is one of the central questions of high - energy astroparticle physics , closely related to the mechanisms of acceleration and propagation of high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "answers are expected from the measurements of the energy spectra for individual elements ( or at least elemental groups ) above 1  pev .",
    "since this is an extreme experimental challenge , one often measures the average atomic mass instead .    in this article ,",
    "the present experimental status is reviewed and the results are set in context to predictions of contemporary models for the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays .    ideally , one would like to continue the energy spectra for individual elements above several @xmath4  ev with direct measurements above the atmosphere .",
    "at present , several groups measure in this region , applying different experimental techniques , e.g. a calorimeter ( atic @xcite ) or a transition radiation detector ( tracer @xcite ) .",
    "the tracer experiment , investigating nuclei from oxygen to iron , had a 14 day flight from mc murdo , antarctica in december 2003 .",
    "recent accelerator tests have shown that transition radiation detectors can be utilized to measure energy spectra of cosmic rays in a space borne experiment up to energies of about 1  pev / n @xcite .",
    "presently , at energies above 1  pev one relies on indirect measurements . in these experiments",
    "the secondary products , generated by interactions of cosmic - ray particles with nuclei in the atmosphere are investigated .",
    "two basic approaches can be distinguished : measuring the debris of the particle cascade at ground level by registering electrons , muons , or hadrons . or measuring the longitudinal shower development in the atmosphere by exploration of the erenkov or fluorescence light generated predominantly by the shower electrons .",
    "an astrophysical interpretation of air shower data requires detailed knowledge of the interaction processes in the atmosphere .",
    "one of the tasks of air shower experiments is to improve the understanding of high - energy interactions above the energies covered by todays accelerator experiments and beyond their kinematical bound , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the bulk of cosmic rays is assumed to be accelerated in shock fronts of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "this goes back to an idea of baade and zwicky , who have estimated the total power required to generate the observed flux of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "it can be shown , that about 3 supernovae per galaxy and century are sufficient to release enough kinetic energy in order to deliver the required power .",
    "a mechanism to accelerate particles by moving magnetic clouds has been introduced by fermi @xcite .",
    "the present understanding of acceleration in strong shock fronts has been initiated by blanford and ostriker @xcite which could demonstrate that at strong shocks particles are accelerated efficiently .",
    "the finite lifetime of a shock front ( @xmath5  a ) limits the maximum energy attainable to @xmath6  pev for particles with charge @xmath7 .",
    "various versions of this scenario have been discussed , see e.g. @xcite . in the literature also other possibilities , like the acceleration of particles in @xmath8-ray bursts are discussed @xcite .    after acceleration ,",
    "the particles propagate in a diffusive process for about @xmath9  a through the galaxy , being deflected many times by the randomly oriented galactic magnetic fields ( @xmath10  @xmath11 g ) .",
    "the propagation is accompanied by leakage of particles out of the galaxy . with increasing energy",
    "it is more and more difficult to magnetically bind the nuclei to the galaxy .",
    "the pathlength of traversed material decreases as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "many approaches have been undertaken to describe the propagation process , see @xcite . during the propagation phase ,",
    "reacceleration of particles has been suggested at shock fronts originating from the galactic wind @xcite .",
    "both , the acceleration and the propagation / leakage processes are expected to yield cut - offs for the fluxes of nuclei at energies proportional to their nuclear charge @xmath14 .    as further possible causes for the knee ,",
    "interactions of cosmic - ray nuclei with background photons or neutrinos in the galaxy @xcite or new types of interactions in the atmosphere @xcite have been discussed . for a more comprehensive review of models",

    "the observations can be interpreted as synchrotron emission from electrons , which are accelerated in these regions @xcite .",
    "recently , the hegra experiments has detected an excess of high - energy @xmath8-rays from the supernova remnant cas a , see . this is interpreted as evidence for hadron acceleration in the snr .",
    "the hadrons interact with protons of the interstellar medium , producing @xmath15s , which decay into high - energy photons , supposedly detected by the hegra experiment @xcite .",
    "the flux is compatible with a model of electron and hadron acceleration in shock fronts , see .",
    "recently , an excess of charged particles from the direction of a snr ( monogem ring , @xmath16  pc ) has been reported @xcite .",
    "however , such a signal could not be confirmed by the kascade experiment @xcite .",
    "the latter has performed a detailed search for point sources , covering the whole visible sky at energies @xmath17  pev .",
    "special attention has been given to the region of the galactic plane , as well as to the vicinity of known snrs and tev-@xmath8-ray sources .",
    "no significant excess could be found .",
    "the gyromagnetic radius for a particle with momentum @xmath18 and charge @xmath19 in a magnetic field @xmath20 . ] of particles with an energy around 1  pev in the galactic magnetic field is in the order of 1  pc .",
    "hence , it is not expected to find any point sources at these energies .        to characterize the large scale anisotropy of cosmic rays , the rayleigh amplitude@xmath21 for @xmath22 events which are detected at a right ascension angle @xmath23",
    "is introduced .",
    "a compilation of measured amplitudes as function of energy is given in @xcite .",
    "an increase of @xmath24 as function of energy can be recognized .",
    "this trend is compatible with expectations taking into account diffusive propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy @xcite , as indicated by the lines .",
    "the all - particle energy spectrum has been derived by many experiments as shown in . in this representation",
    "the flux of the air shower experiments has been normalized to the extrapolated flux of direct measurements at 1  pev by introducing a slight adjustment ( @xmath25 ) of the energy scales of the individual experiments @xcite .",
    "it is quite interesting to realize that the absolute energy calibration of these various experiments , using different observation techniques and models to describe the shower development in the atmosphere agree within @xmath25 . the normalized all - particle flux changes",
    "smoothly without any prominent structures .",
    "the solid and doted lines indicate the total sum of galactic cosmic rays according to a parameterization of data @xcite .",
    "the kascade group performed systematic studies to evaluate the influence of different hadronic interaction models used in the simulations to interpret the data on the resulting spectra for elemental groups @xcite .",
    "two sets of spectra , derived from the observation of the electromagnetic and muonic air shower components , applying the gold algorithm and using corsika @xcite with the hadronic interaction models qgsjet and sibyll are compiled in figure  [ kascade ] .    as can be seen in the figure , the flux for elemental groups depends on the model used .",
    "the kascade group emphasizes that at present , there are systematic differences between measured and simulated observables , which result in the ambiguities of the spectra for elemental groups .",
    "these conclusions apply in a similar way also to other experiments .",
    "a correct deconvolution of energy spectra for elemental groups requires a precise knowledge of the hadronic interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "the interaction models presently used do not describe the measurements with a sufficiently high precision required for this task .",
    "the figure also shows the spectrum of primary protons , which has been derived from the flux of unaccompanied hadrons @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is compatible with the proton flux as obtained from the unfolding procedure when using the qgsjet model . for comparison , also",
    "the results of direct measurements at lower energies at the top of the atmosphere @xcite are presented in the figure .    in order to give an impression of the present status , the energy spectra for three elemental groups ( protons , helium , and iron nuclei ) are compiled in over a wide energy range . shown",
    "are results from direct measurements above the atmosphere as well as the kascade results described above .",
    "the eas - top experiment published two sets of spectra with different assumptions about the contribution of protons and helium nuclei , for details see @xcite .",
    "the resulting fluxes are indicated by two squares per primary energy . to guide the eye ,",
    "the solid lines indicate power law spectra with a cut - off at @xmath26  pev . for the iron spectrum at low energies",
    "the influence of modulation due to the magnetic fields of the heliosphere can be recognized .",
    "the dashed lines represent calculations of energy spectra for nuclei accelerated in supernova remnants by sveshnikova  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the particles are accelerated in a variety of supernovae populations , each having an individual maximum energy to be attained during acceleration , which results in the bumpy structure of the obtained spectra .",
    "the dotted lines reflect calculations of the diffusive propagation of particles through the galaxy by kalmykov  @xcite .",
    "the leakage of particles yields a rigidity dependent cut - off .",
    "comparison with the data may suggest a _ qualitative _ understanding of the energy spectra . however , for a precise _ quantitative _ understanding , detailed investigations of the systematic errors of the measurements are necessary and the description of the interaction processes in the atmosphere needs to be improved .",
    "the position of the maximum of an electromagnetic or nuclear cascade in matter depends on the incident particles energy as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy per nucleon @xmath29 .",
    "hence , @xmath30 depends on @xmath31 .",
    "also , many other observables in air showers like the number of electrons , muons , or hadrons observed at ground level depend roughly on @xmath32 . to characterize the cosmic - ray mass composition one uses commonly the mean logarithmic mass @xmath33 , defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the relative fraction of nuclei with atomic mass number @xmath36 .",
    "the mean logarithmic mass from experiments measuring electrons , muons , and hadrons at ground level using mostly corsika / qgsjet to interpret the data are compiled in c. one recognizes an increase of @xmath33 as function of energy , the line indicates an increase as expected for a rigidity dependent cut - off for individual elements @xcite .",

    "is not obtained .",
    "the description of hadronic interactions within the models is based on accelerator measurements . however , extrapolating the experimental uncertainties to higher energies may cause significant differences in the interpretation of air shower data . for example , the cross sections for proton - anti proton collisions at the tevatron @xmath38",
    "tev@xmath39 exhibit an error of about 10% . to investigate the influence of such uncertainties on the development of air showers , in the model qgsjet 01",

    "as can be inferred from , the situation is not yet conclusive , but a trend towards a standard picture can be recognized .",
    "some of the proposed explanations can already be excluded .",
    "interactions with background particles in the galaxy would produce a big amount of secondary protons , which results in a light mass composition at high energies , not confirmed by the experiments .",

    "comparing the present results to the status before the start of the kascade experiment ( about one decade ago ) , our knowledge about high - energy cosmic rays has significantly improved .",
    "the experiment has shown that the knee is caused by the subsequent cut - offs of individual elements , starting with protons and helium nuclei and that the mean logarithmic mass increases as function of energy .    summarizing the large number of experimental observations , there are indications for a standard picture of galactic cosmic rays",
    ". at least a large fraction of them seems to be accelerated in supernova remnants up to energies of @xmath41  pev .",
    "higher energies may be reached by reacceleration in the galactic wind or by acceleration in additional sources , such as @xmath8-ray bursts .",
    "the particles propagate in a diffusive process through the galaxy . with rising energy",
    "the pathlength decreases and particles escape easier from the galaxy .",
    "this brings about the knee in the energy spectrum .",
    "when the understanding of the hadronic interactions in the atmosphere improves , the measurements can be interpreted with higher reliability .",
    "this will put more restrictions on the models to describe acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays .",
