    "the potential misalignment of flavor between supersymmetry breaking parameters and the ordinary ckm matrix leads to the possibility of supersymmetry - induced flavor violation @xcite . in general the size of this flavor violation , within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , far exceeds the bounds from the myriad observations and searches for flavor violation in the quark and lepton sector @xcite .",
    "constraints on flavor violation are strongest between the first and second generation , though substantial constraints also exist between the third generation and the light generations .",
    "the top sector is the least constrained , but also the most interesting for collider physics , since tops can be identified given their kinematics and decay pattern .",
    "recently , a new approach to weak scale supersymmetry that incorporates an ( exact or approximate ) @xmath0-symmetry @xcite , suggests large flavor violation in the supersymmetry breaking parameters may be present _ without _ exceeding the flavor - violating bounds @xcite .",
    "this is possible for several reasons : left - right squark and slepton mixing is absent ; the gaugino masses @xmath4 can be naturally @xmath5 heavier than the scalar masses ; and several flavor - violating operators are more suppressed than in the mssm due to the absence of @xmath0-violating operators . in this paper , we study one particularly interesting collider signal of flavor violation within the context of an @xmath0-symmetric model : single top production from squark pair production in which one squark decays to a top and gaugino , while the other squark decays to a non - top quark and gaugino .",
    "interestingly , another source of single top can result from sgluons in @xmath0-symmetric models , as was recently shown by @xcite .",
    "single top is an important process in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . beyond the standard model , in the context of supersymmetry ,",
    "several groups have explored a single top signal with or without additional flavor violation in the squark mass matrices @xcite as well as resulting from @xmath0-parity violation @xcite . unlike the approaches in these papers",
    ", however , our single top signal does not suffer from substantial restrictions from other flavor - violating processes .",
    "the presence of an @xmath0-symmetry suggests large flavor - violation can be probed in a variety of ways involving sleptons as well as squarks .",
    "nevertheless , we make no attempt at an exhaustive study of flavor violation .",
    "our focus is on the shortest possible decay chains of squarks : pair - produced squarks that decay into different flavors of quarks and the lightest gaugino .",
    "we consider three basic scenarios : ( i ) the `` collider - equivalent '' lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a neutralino , ( ii ) the next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) is a neutralino that decays within the detector to a photon and a gravitino lsp , and ( iii ) the nlsp is a chargino that may or may not decay ( within the detector ) to a gravitino lsp .",
    "cases ii and iii arise when the scale of mediation of supersymmetry breaking is low @xcite or as a consequence of a strongly coupled hidden sector @xcite . in an @xmath0-symmetric model ,",
    "@xmath0-symmetry itself may be broken explicitly in the hidden sector to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "this explicit breaking , communicated via anomaly - mediation to the visible sector , leads to suppressed contributions to @xmath0-violating supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "the size of this contribution is proportional to the gravitino mass , which can not exceed the weak scale to ensure the @xmath0-violation in the visible sector , proportional to @xmath6 the gravitino mass , is sufficiently small . given a much smaller mass for the gravitino , where it becomes the lsp , the induced @xmath0-violation automatically becomes safe .",
    "two interesting scenarios for a signal of flavor violation result within the mrssm with a gravitino lsp : one with a neutralino next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) ; the other , a chargino nlsp . depending on the strength of the interaction between the nlsp and the lsp",
    ", the nlsp can be long lived .",
    "the characteristic signals depend sensitively on the lifetime of the nlsp .",
    "finally , our mrssm analysis can also be applied to the mssm in a partially @xmath0-symmetric limit , which may well be of interest in its own right . as a reminder",
    ", @xmath0-symmetry forbids left - right mass mixings among squarks and sleptons , and also implies gauginos are dirac fermions .",
    "( a brief review of the mrssm and its characteristics is provided in the appendix of this paper . ) at the lhc , squark two - body decay into a dirac gaugino lsp is indistinguishable from squark decay two - body decay into a majorana gaugino lsp .",
    "then in the mssm , left - right mixing is proportional to @xmath7 or @xmath8 for up - type or down - type sfermions , and thus can vanish for particular choices of parameters .",
    "it is in this limit that our results apply to the mssm .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : threecases ] we outline the three classes of signals that we consider in this paper .",
    "we then proceed to analyze each case in subsequent sections . in sec .",
    "[ sec : case1 ] we consider the signal top signal with a neutralino lsp . in sec .",
    "[ sec : case2 ] we consider the signal top signal with a neutralino nlsp that decays within the detector to a gravitino and photon . in sec .",
    "[ sec : case3 ] we consider the signal top signal with a chargino nlsp . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we are concerned exclusively with squark production and decay at colliders , specifically at the lhc .",
    "consequently , for us `` lsp '' always refers to `` collider - equivalent lsp '' .",
    "that is , the last particle in the supersymmetry decay chain that escapes the detector .",
    "this means that we treat a strict neutralino lsp the same as a neutralino collider - equivalent lsp where the latter decays into a gravitino well outside the detector .",
    "there are three separate scenarios with a signal of squark flavor violation that we focus on in this paper :    * the lightest neutralino is a collider - equivalent lsp .",
    "the shortest decay chain possible is for the squark to decay directly into a quark plus neutralino . within this class of processes",
    ", we examine the flavor - violating signal of a single top , _ i.e. _ , we select events that contain one top quark and one quark of different flavor .",
    "top is identified by the detection of its decay products ( @xmath9 and a leptonic decay of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the specific collider signal is thus one lepton , one tagged @xmath9 jet , and one other jet .",
    "we look for flavor violation in single top for three reasons : first , flavor violation in the up sector , especially flavor violation involving the third generation , is relatively unconstrained .",
    "second , the hard lepton from @xmath10-decay provides a good trigger for these events and an effective way to reduce the immense qcd background .",
    "lastly , @xmath9-jets can be tagged most efficiently among all jets . *",
    "the lightest neutralino is the nlsp , which decays within the detector to a gravitino lsp .",
    "the nlsp decays into a gravitino and a photon or a @xmath11 .",
    "decays to a @xmath11 are typically kinematically suppressed compared to the decays to a photon , and thus we will focus on signals containing two hard photons plus missing energy . for supersymmetric single - top production ,",
    "the parton - level final state is now @xmath12 .",
    "however , because the hard photons provide a reliable trigger and excellent background discrimination , we do not require a lepton to suppress sm background in this scenario .",
    "therefore we are free to consider flavor - violating processes other than single - top production : for example , we may also look at flavor violation in the sbottom sector @xmath13 , in which case the final state of interest is @xmath14 . *",
    "the chargino is the nlsp , and the gravitino is the lsp .",
    "the main difference from case ii is that if the chargino is long - lived , it produces tracks inside the detector .",
    "accordingly , three different sub - cases arise depending on the decay length of the chargino : * * the decay of the chargino is prompt . in this case",
    ", the single top signal arises from down - squark pair production into one @xmath15 ( decaying into a @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and one jet with two @xmath1 .",
    "up - squark pair - production gives a similar signal , except that the @xmath9 is produced directly , and thus there is no additional @xmath10 from top decay .",
    "* * the chargino is long - lived , but decays inside the detector . * * the chargino decays outside the detector , producing tracks of charged heavy particles escaping the detector .    in the next few sections we systematically analyze these cases in the context of observing the single top signal of squark flavor violation .",
    "single top production is widely understood to be an important process as it allows a direct test of the unitarity of the ckm matrix . in the sm",
    ", however , single top production proceeds only through electroweak interactions and , depending on the production channel , it is also suppressed by the @xmath9-quark pdf , ckm angles , or phase space .",
    "thus , this provides an opportunity for a beyond the sm signal to be seen in this channel at the lhc . in our scenario ,",
    "the bsm - induced single top signal can receive significant enhancement due to the flavor - violating elements in the scalar mass matrices in the mrssm .",
    "our goal is to isolate this signal from among the sm and detector backgrounds .",
    "the signal events arise due to the following processes in the mrssm @xmath16 where we used notation from the appendix : the up - type squarks @xmath17 and @xmath18 are mass eigenstates and @xmath19 is the lightest neutralino of the mrssm . for this case , @xmath19 escapes the detector , giving rise to additional missing energy .",
    "we require that the @xmath10 decays leptonically for triggering purposes and to suppress multijet qcd backgrounds .",
    "this flavor - violating signal requires that the two squarks decay differently  one decays to top , and the other to an up or charm quark .",
    "both decay modes must have significant branching ratios .",
    "a necessary condition for a significant number of signal events is then the presence of large mixing angles in the squark mass matrices . in order to simplify the discussion",
    ", we take the squark mixing matrix to be @xmath20 so that we have mixing between two species of the squarks only .",
    "sfermion mixing matrices are defined in app .",
    "[ app : matter ] , while the lagrangian written in the mass eigenstate basis incorporating these mixing matrices can be found in app .",
    "[ app : lagrangian ] . in the following",
    ", we will assume the mixing angle to be maximal .",
    "the size of our signal , however , can be simply scaled with the mixing angle given otherwise identical kinematics .",
    "the presence of a large mixing angle , by itself , is not sufficient to yield the flavor - violating signal we seek",
    ". the squark masses also play a crucial role - they determine whether or not decay channels are kinematically open . throughout this paper",
    "we assume squark masses are large enough such that decays to top and the lightest neutralino is not kinematically forbidden .",
    "more importantly , the branching ratios depend crucially on the composition of @xmath19 , i.e. , how much bino , neutral wino , and neutral higgsino is present .",
    "there are thus three distinct limits :    * the lightest neutralino is mostly a bino .",
    "such a scenario arises when @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 are the @xmath0-symmetric bino , wino , up - type higgsino and down - type higgsino masses , defined in app .",
    "[ app : gaugehiggs ] . *",
    "the lightest neutralino is mostly a neutral higgsino .",
    "this occurs if either or both of @xmath23 are much smaller than @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "* the lightest neutralino is mostly a wino .",
    "this occurs when @xmath26 .",
    "this scenario is disfavored when @xmath27  tev , since a vev develops for the scalar su(2 ) triplet , which leads to an excessive contribution to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "also , a light wino in the presence of flavor violation in the up sector also could lead to sizable contributions to fcncs such as @xmath29 mixing .",
    "we do not consider this possibility further .",
    "the difference in the first two limits can be easily seen in the gaugino - squark - quark couplings given in the appendix ( _ c.f .",
    "_ , eq .  ; in this equation , neutralinos are in electroweak gauge eigenstates ) .",
    "the only quark which couples to up - type squarks in the squark - quark - higgsino interactions is the top quark .",
    "this implies that , if the lightest neutralinos are higgsinos ( in the notation of the appendix , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , the two body decay of up - type squarks to the lightest neutralino always proceed to a top quark  regardless of the squark flavor content .",
    "this happens precisely since we consider only the third generation quark masses to be nonzero .",
    "even if the masses of the first two generations are taken into account , the decay of a squark into a higgsino and a lighter quark is highly suppressed when compared to the decay into top .",
    "hence , finding flavor - violation with a higgsino - like lightest gaugino is extremely challenging .",
    "the bino limit is much more promising .",
    "gauge invariance requires that the couplings are universal , independent of generation ( in the pure bino limit ) .",
    "the only difference arises due to squark mixing angles .",
    "it is useful to define the flavor - violating ratio @xmath32 @xmath33 which characterizes the amount of up - type flavor violation revealed in squark decay . to illustrate how large @xmath32 can be within the mrssm parameter space , in figs .",
    "[ fig:1],[fig:2 ] we have plotted @xmath32 as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath34 where we took @xmath35 and @xmath36  tev .",
    "maximal mixing angle implies that each squark mass eigenstate couples equally to @xmath15 and @xmath37 . taking the mass of the squark to be @xmath38  gev , in figs .",
    "[ fig:1],[fig:2 ] we plot @xmath32 for @xmath39 .    clearly , the region with @xmath40 occurs when the lightest neutralino is mostly a bino .",
    "in addition , note that using the mixing angles shown in eq .  , we find that the amplitude for the decay @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 , whereas the decay of @xmath43 to the same final states is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that , if these two mass eigenstates are of equal mass , then there is complete cancellation of the amplitudes ( a squark gim mechanism ) .",
    "thus , in order to have a non - zero mrssm contribution to single top , the scalar masses must be hierarchical .",
    "finally , the gaugino hierarchy @xmath21 automatically ensures that all charginos and other neutralinos are also heavy .",
    "if the squarks are light enough , it is plausible that the only open channel for the two body decay of a squark is into a @xmath19 and quark .",
    "there are considerable standard model events which constitute the background for single top events in eq .   due to flavor violation .",
    "one needs to eliminate not only all the electroweak single top events but also all the standard model events which mimic single top . a quantitative study that explores the feasibility of finding flavor violation at lhc in the new physics production of single top must include all these backgrounds . in this subsection",
    "we systematically analyze signals due to sample spectra on top of the standard model backgrounds after imposing a set of cuts and show how the significance of signal vary as we change parameters in the spectrum .",
    "we start this subsection with a description of the software tools we have used .",
    "we list all the channels that have relevant contributions towards the background along with their cross - sections after using generic parton level cuts .",
    "we then compare these background events to the signal events generated in a sample spectrum after we impose various well motivated cuts and estimate the significance of the signal .",
    "we also show how the significance varies as the spectrum itself is varied while keeping the same set of cuts used before .",
    "we end this subsection with a brief discussion of further refinements .",
    "to simulate the signals and background necessary for our analysis of flavor violation , we used several different monte carlo event generators .",
    "all events were first created at parton level utilizing matrix - element generators : alpgenv13  @xcite for the backgrounds , and madgraphv4  @xcite for the signal .",
    "the inputs to the matrix element generators are a set of parton level cuts , which we list under table  [ table : sigbr ] , a factorization / renormalization scale , and a parton distribution function ( pdf ) set . for factorization / renormalization scales",

    "the default pdfs were used throughout ",
    "cteq5l for the background and cteq6l1 for the signal .",
    "all parton level events ( signal + background ) were passed through pythia6.4  @xcite for showering and hadronization , and pgs4.0  @xcite for detector simulation .",

    "jet smearing : the energy / momentum for jets are smeared by an amount @xmath54 not only does this affect the resolution of any object reconstructed from jets , but it also affects the missing energy : @xmath55 , so an error in the visible energy becomes an error in the missing energy . *",

    "both the tag and mistag rates vary with @xmath59 and are modeled in pgs using a cdf fit .",
    "a @xmath9-jet can only be tagged if it goes through the tracker which has pseudo - rapidity extent @xmath51 .      in order to avoid potentially disastrous qcd backgrounds",
    ", we require the @xmath10 from top quark decay to itself decay leptonically .",
    "therefore the signal we wish to identify , in terms of objects seen in the detector , is : @xmath60 an important distinction between the signal and background is the source of missing energy .",

    "first , many sm backgrounds contain only one neutrino and therefore only one source of missing energy .",
    "second , several backgrounds ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 in particular ) require one of the @xmath9 quarks to be mistagged , while others ( @xmath76 ) require a light jet to fake a @xmath9-jet . both of these facts will be exploited in the cuts section to separate the signal from the background .",

    ".signals and background processes considered .",
    "cross sections include the branching ratios to leptons ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "all events were generated with parton level cuts of @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , while the @xmath80 and @xmath81 backgrounds were generated with the additional cut of @xmath82 .",

    "the parton level cuts were imposed to make event generation more efficient ; ideally parton level cuts should be softer then the analysis cuts to allow initial and final state radiation to have an effect .",

    "<S> we consider the prospects for measuring squark flavor violation through the signal of single top production at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we study this signal in the context of @xmath0-symmetric supersymmetry , which allows for large flavor violation in the squark sector , however the results can also be generalized to the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> the single top signal arises from squark pair production in which one squark decays to a top and gaugino , whereas the other squark decays to a non - top quark and gaugino . </S>",
    "<S> we study three decay patterns : ( i ) squark decay into a quark and neutralino lsp ; ( ii ) squark decay into a quark and neutralino nlsp , with subsequent decay of the nlsp to a photon and gravitino ; ( iii ) squark decay into a quark and chargino nlsp , with subsequent decay of the nlsp to a @xmath1 and gravitino . </S>",
    "<S> case ii is the most promising , when the nlsp decay is prompt , since every event contains two hard photons that can be used to tag the events , reducing the background to a negligible level . </S>",
    "<S> case i is promising if the neutralino lsp is bino - like . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully consider large sm backgrounds and identify a series of cuts to isolate the signal . </S>",
    "<S> case iii can occur in the minimal @xmath0-symmetric supersymmetric standard model ( mrssm ) with higgsino - like lightest gauginos . due to the large higgs coupling , squarks preferentially decay to top quarks , substantially reducing the potential flavor violating signal . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the flavor violating signal might still be identifiable if the chargino nlsp is long - lived .    * </S>",
