    "semiconductor nanowires ( nws ) represent systems for exploring nanoscale physics and to design a variety of new devices ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "they can be grown not only on dissimilar substrates but also as axial and radial heterostructures.@xcite device concepts based on the spin rather than the charge of the electron have been introduced in the field of spintronics . among these concepts ,",
    "nanowires that combine a semiconductor and a ferromagnet in a core - shell geometry have gained a lot of interest since 2009 when they were presented for the first time @xcite .",
    "because of the cylindrical shape of the ferromagnet , such core - shell nanowires could allow for a magnetization along the wire and thus perpendicular to the substrate surface . ferromagnetic stripes or tubes with a magnetization perpendicular to the substrate",
    "have the potential for circular polarized light emitting diodes that optically can transmit spin information in zero external magnetic field and thus allow for on - chip optical communication of spins on the one hand @xcite .",
    "on the other hand they enable three - dimensional magnetic recording with unsurpassed data storage capacities @xcite .",
    "the perfect lattice matching of the binary heusler alloy fe@xmath0si and gaas allows for the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) growth of planar high quality hybrid structures @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cubic fe@xmath0si phase @xcite , shows a robust stability against stoichiometric variations with only slightly modified magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "moreover , its thermal stability against chemical reactions at the ferromagnet / semiconductor interface is considerably higher than that of conventional ferromagnets like fe , co , ni , and fe@xmath2co@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "together with the high curie temperature of about 840 k this material system has therefore several advantages compared to most of the previously studied semiconductor - ferromagnet core - shell nanowires using ferromagnetic materials that can not reach the high quality of a binary heusler alloy like fe@xmath0si @xcite .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated for the first time that gaas - fe@xmath0si core - shell nws prepared by mbe show ferromagnetic properties with a magnetization oriented along the nw axis ( perpendicular to the substrate ) @xcite .",
    "however , the structural properties and hence the magnetic properties of the core - shell nws depend strongly on the substrate temperature during the growth of the fe@xmath0si shell @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present a detailed investigation of the real structure of both gaas nws and gaas - fe@xmath0si core - shell nws using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) .",
    "fe@xmath0si - gaas core - shell nw structures are grown by mbe on si(111 ) substrates . first , gaas nanowires are fabricated by the ga - assisted growth mode on the si(111 ) substrates covered with a thin native si - oxide layer .",
    "the growth mechanism is the vapor - liquid - solid ( vls ) mechanism,@xcite where pin holes in the sio@xmath4 serve as nucleation sites.@xcite a ga droplet is the preferred site for deposition from the vapor .",
    "the gaas nw then starts to grow by preferential nucleation at the spatially restricted gaas / si interface ( if ) .",
    "further growth is unidirectional and proceeds at the solid / liquid if .",
    "the gaas nws are grown at a substrate temperature of 580@xmath5c , and a v / iii flux ratio of unity",
    ". the equivalent two - dimensional growth rate amounts to 100  nm / h . in order to finish the nw growth , the ga - shutter is closed .",
    "then the ga - droplets on top of the nws are consumed in the arsenic atmosphere . during this phase of the experiment",
    "there is still a certain nw growth taking place at a reduced diameter .",
    "the samples are then cooled down .",
    "once the nw templates are grown , they are transferred under ultra high vacuum conditions to an as free growth chamber for metals of the same mbe system . there",
    "the gaas nw templates are covered with fe@xmath1si shells at different substrate temperatures ranging from 100  @xmath5c to 350  @xmath5c . more details regarding the growth conditions can be found in ref .",
    "the main growth parameters are summarized in table [ tab : tab1 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    the nw structures are characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , by dark - field ( df ) and high - resolution ( hr ) tem , selected area diffraction ( sad ) of electrons and xrd .",
    "the tem specimens are prepared by mechanical lapping and polishing , followed by argon ion milling according to standard techniques .",
    "tem images are acquired with a jeol 3010 microscope operating at 200 kv and 300  kv .",
    "the cross section tem methods provide high lateral and depth resolutions on the nanometer scale , however they average over the thickness of the thin sample foil or the thickness of the nw as a whole .",
    "the resolution limit of the dark - field method with the tem used is in the ideal case about 0.2 nm . there can be additional errors due to projection and due to curvature of the interfaces .",
    "hr xrd measurements are performed using a panalytical x - pert pro mrd  system with a ge(220 ) hybrid monochromator ( cu  k@xmath6 radiation with a wavelength of @xmath7   ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sem ]  ( a ) shows an sem micrograph of the pure gaas nws ( sample  0 ) .",
    "the micrograph of the sample surface reveals a relatively low area density of nws of about 5@xmath810@xmath9@xmath10 . besides the well oriented nws we see gaas hillhocks.@xcite during the last phase of gaas nw growth no more ga",
    "is supplied , and so the remaining ga in the droplet on top of the nws is consumed leading to a prolongation of the nw at reduced diameter .",

    "it fulfills the diffraction condition in correspondence to the different orientations of the individual crystallites .",

    "the diffusion of fe@xmath0si along the sidewalls can be neglected , in first approximation .",

    "the si and gaas reflections occur only in the upper scan , i.e. si and gaas are single crystalline",
    ". as the reflections of gaas and fe@xmath0si practically coincide , diffraction of some [ 111 ] oriented fe@xmath0si crystallites may be contained in the gaas reflections as well .",
    "we observe a clear tendency of stronger fe@xmath0si facetting with increasing t@xmath18 [ cf .",
    "[ fig : dp ]  ( a ) and [ fig : dfht ]  ( a ) , e.g. ] .",
    "usually these facets are observed to be inclined to the nw axis .",
    "the formation of facets reduces the overall surface energy and evidences non negligible material transport over distances small compared to the nw lengths .",
    "unfortunately , the orientation of those facets does not coincide with those of the original gaas nws .",
    "that is why the shell thickness inhomogeneity is increasing with t@xmath18 due to the facetted growth .",
    "higher substrate temperatures during growth of the fe@xmath0si shell lead to enhanced surface diffusion . under the condition of poor wetting the enhanced diffusion leads to formation of fe@xmath0si islands having an equilibrium shape , i.e. their own facets . at even higher substrate temperatures we found chemical reactions at the fe@xmath0si / gaas and the gaas / si interfaces causing the extended pits around the core - shell nws together with the partial destruction of the gaas cores .",
    "layer - by - layer growth at medium substrate temperatures could in principle solve the problem of facetting .",
    "however , even planar fe@xmath1si grows on gaas in the vollmer - weber ( vw ) growth mode @xcite .",
    "poor wetting during the growth of fe@xmath1si on the gaas surface leads initially to isolated islands , although both lattices match perfectly .",
    "we speculate that textured fe@xmath1si shells found in the present work are a result of the vw growth mode . in general , one way to improve the homogeneity and the other structural properties of the fe@xmath0si - shells could be the use of surfactants .",
    "@xcite for the growth on gaas the following surfactant materials are under discussion : sb  @xcite , bi  @xcite , te  @xcite , pb  @xcite .",
    "the surfactant sb improved the growth of other silicides as well .",
    "the gaas core nws grow epitaxially on the bare si(111 ) surface inside holes of the sio@xmath4 film via the vls growth mechanism .",
    "a gaas / si if is formed without any amorphous phase in between .",
    "two stages of the growth of the gaas cores can be distinguished : regular growth and residual growth after ending of the ga supply .",
    "the surfaces of the original gaas nws are completely covered by magnetic fe@xmath1si exhibiting an enhanced surface roughness compared to the bare gaas nws , partly due to formation of facets . nevertheless , continuous magnetic shells are established .",
    "bright- and dark - field micrographs reveal homogeneous contrast in the gaas cores and pronounced inhomogeneity in the fe@xmath1si shells and the parasitic fe@xmath1si film .",
    "the substrate temperature during fe@xmath0si deposition has a strong influence on the structural quality of the nw structures , especially the fe@xmath0si shells .",
    "growth of the shells at high substrate temperatures above @xmath11  =  200@xmath5c leads to severe reactions between the shell and the core as well as the parasitic layer and the substrate which are detrimental for device applications .",
    "increased facetting is observed with growing substrate temperature t@xmath18 .",
    "poly - crystalline fe@xmath1si shells found in the present work are probably the result of the vw growth mode of fe@xmath1si on the surfaces of the gaas nws .",
    "nevertheless , such a grainy structure may even be sufficient for spintronic devices , because they are forming a dense film of magnetic material around the semiconducting cores .",
