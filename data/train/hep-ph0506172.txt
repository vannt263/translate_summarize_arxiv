    "however , with the autocorrelation technique we observe that jet structure is very well defined , even down to hadron pairs with particle @xmath106 gev / c .",
    "the hatched regions to the left in those panels show the values measured for minimum - bias hard - component hadrons , which are weighted toward lower @xmath4 . in the following section",
    "we examine the systematics of @xmath101 _ vs _ @xmath48 separately on @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and for values of parton @xmath5 previously inaccessible .",
    "by applying eq .  ( [ jt ] ) with the values of @xmath108 defined on the @xmath8 cut space as in fig .  [ consym ] ( first panel )",
    "we obtain @xmath101 values for @xmath109 from the corresponding angular widths . in fig .",
    "[ jtkt ] ( second and third panels ) we observe a strong decrease in both @xmath101 components with decreasing @xmath48 ( @xmath110 parton @xmath5 ) .",
    "we also observe substantial differences in the @xmath101 @xmath16 and @xmath17 components , converging however to the ` @xmath101 scaling ' expectation at larger @xmath48 ( hatched bands ) .",
    "it is notable that the orientation of the @xmath101 asymmetry ( major axis lying in the @xmath111 plane ) is parallel to the ` contact plane ' of the parton collision .",
    "that asymmetry orientation is orthogonal to what is observed for low-@xmath5 jet fragments in central heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",

    "we also measured the angular width of the _ away - side _ azimuth correlation of hadron pairs ( @xmath112 ) and compared it with the same - side azimuth correlation to infer the mean transverse momentum @xmath107 of partons prior to scattering .",
    "we converted the angular widths to @xmath107 values according to eq .",
    "( [ kt ] ) , where @xmath52 estimates the mean value of the ratio of ` trigger particle ' momentum to parton momentum . at larger @xmath4",
    "that value is approximately 0.75 , but is a falling function of @xmath4 for smaller fragment @xmath4 , as in this case .",
    "below @xmath113 ( hadron @xmath114 gev / c ) we observe that @xmath107 values fall below the @xmath95-scaling trend ( hatched band ) by an increasing amount with smaller @xmath48 ( smaller @xmath5 ) .",
    "the trend of pythia @xmath107 values ( dotted line ) is substantially displaced below the data .",
    "we have presented a broad survey of newly - obtained two - particle correlations from 200 gev p - p collisions at rhic .",
    "correlations from longitudinal string fragmentation and transverse scattered parton fragmentation are clearly distinguished .",
    "the former is dominated by local momentum and charge conservation .",
    "the latter provides new access to scattering and fragmentation of _ minimum - bias _ partons . using newly - devised analysis techniques we find that low-@xmath5 parton fragmentation is accessible down to hadron @xmath4 = 0.35 gev / c for both hadrons of a correlated pair .",
    "jet morphology for low-@xmath5 partons requires a more general treatment of fragment @xmath4 distributions and angular correlations .",
    "fragment distributions on transverse rapidity @xmath1 are ` infrared safe ' and exhibit interesting systematic behaviors which can be compared with the mlla .",
    "jet angular correlations show a dramatic asymmetry about the thrust axis at low-@xmath5 ( up to 2:1 aspect ratio , with larger width in the azimuth direction ) , possibly related to nonperturbative details of soft parton collisions .",
    "these measurements of p - p correlations provide an important reference for the study of _ in - medium modification _ of parton scattering and fragmentation in heavy ion collisions .",
