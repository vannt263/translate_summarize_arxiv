    "the production and properties of hyperons have been studied for more than 50 years , mostly in pion and kaon induced reactions .",
    "hyperon production in pp collisions has been investigated close to threshold at saturne ( saclay , france ) and cosy - jlich .",
    "reasonably complete information on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be found in the literature @xcite although for the @xmath6 , in spite of rather high statistics achieved ( the total world statistics is several thousand events ) , there are still open questions concerning the nature of this resonance : is it a singlet _ qqq _ state in the frame of su(3 ) or a quark - gluon _",
    "( uds - q ) _ hybrid , or a kn bound state ?",
    "the @xmath8 hyperon is not well established yet . in the 2004 review of particle physics",
    "it is described as a bump with unknown quantum numbers .",
    "we have investigated whether additional information on hyperon production might be obtained from proton - proton interactions at low energies .",
    "the experiment has been performed at the cooler synchrotron cosy at the research center jlich ( germany )  @xcite .",
    "cosy is a medium energy accelerator and storage ring for both polarized and unpolarized protons and deuterons .",
    "the measurements were performed at a proton beam momentum of 3.65  gev / c incident on a a hydrogen cluster  jet target .",
    "the average luminosity during the measurements was @xmath9 .",
    "the anke magnetic spectrometer  @xcite used in the experiment consists of three dipole magnets .",
    "the central c  shaped spectrometer d2 , placed downstream of the target , separates the reaction products from the circulating cosy beam .",
    "the anke detection system , comprising range telescopes , scintillation counters and multi  wire proportional chambers , simultaneously registers both positively and negatively charged particles and measures their momenta  @xcite .    at a cosy beam momentum of 3.65  gev / c hyperons @xmath10 with masses up to @xmath111540",
    "mev / c@xmath12 can be produced in the reaction @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : only_pk ] the missing mass @xmath1 spectrum is shown for the case that a @xmath14  meson in coincidence with a proton is detected with anke .",
    "while the ground - state hyperons are clearly seen in the spectrum , the heavier ones are on top of a broad background which can mainly be attributed to the production of additional pions .",
    "thus the unambigous identification of these hyperons requires the detection of additional coincident particles from their decays .    a final state comprising a proton , a positively charged kaon , a pion of either charge and an unidentified residue x was investigated in the reaction @xmath15 .",
    "a missing mass @xmath16 spectrum in the reaction @xmath17 shows a flat background with a peak at approximately 1195  mev/@xmath18 ( left part in fig .  [ fig : mm3 ] ) .",
    "the peak corresponds to the decay @xmath19 . in the charge  mirrored case ,",
    "the @xmath20 may originate from different sources , _",
    "e.g. _  a decay with the @xmath21 or a secondary decay of @xmath22 , arising from the major background reaction @xmath23 .",
    "protons from this reaction can be easily rejected by cutting the missing mass @xmath24 around the proton mass ( right part in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm3 ] ) . nevertheless the missing mass distribution for the @xmath25-final state is more complicated .",
    "if only events around the @xmath26 mass are selected , then the missing mass spectrum @xmath1 in the reaction @xmath27 shows two peaks , see left part in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm2 ] .",
    "one of them corresponds to the contribution of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons .",
    "the second peak is located at a mass @xmath111480  mev / c@xmath12 . in the @xmath28 case ,",
    "the distribution also peaks at 1480  mev / c@xmath12 , see right part in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm2 ] .    we have assumed that the measured missing mass @xmath1 spectra can be explained by the production of hyperon resonances and non - resonant contributions .",
    "detailed monte carlo simulations have been performed including the production of well established excited hyperons ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and non - resonant contributions like @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; @xmath33 denotes any hyperon which could be produced in the experiment . from the comparison of measured and simulated missing mass distributions it turned out that it is necessary to include another excited hyperon @xmath34 with a mass @xmath35 and a width @xmath36",
    "we have found an indication of a neutral hyperon resonance @xmath34 produced in proton  proton collisions at 3.65  gev / c and decaying into @xmath37 and @xmath38 final states .",
    "its parameters are @xmath39 and @xmath40 though , since it is neutral , it can be either a @xmath41 or @xmath26  hyperon .",
    "the statistical significance of a signal is at the level of 4.8 standard deviations .",
    "the production cross section is of the order of few hundred nanobarns .",
    "it seems to be difficult to integrate the low mass @xmath34 hyperon within the existing classification of 3q - baryons @xcite .",
    "on the basis of available data we can not decide whether it is a 3quark baryon or an exotic state , although some preference towards its exotic nature may be deduced from theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "further studies are required to determine its quantum numbers . at anke , using a deuterium cluster target and spectator proton tagging , one can search for the charged @xmath42 hyperon in the reaction @xmath43 .",
    "the investigation of @xmath44 decays with photons in the final state is foreseen with the wasa detector at cosy  @xcite .   + this work has been supported by : ffe grant ( cosy-78 , nr 41553602 ) , bmbf ( wtz - rus-211 - 00 , 691 - 01 , wtz - pol-015 - 01 , 041 - 01 ) , dfg ( 436 rus 113/337 , 444 , 561 , 768 ) , russian academy of sciences ( 02 - 04 - 034 , 02 - 04034 , 02 - 18179a , 02 - 06518 ) .",
