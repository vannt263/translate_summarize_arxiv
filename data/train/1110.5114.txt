    "there have been several studies of oort cloud formation in a star cluster environment . in 1999",
    "soenke eggers published his ph.d .",
    "thesis in which he analysed the effects of a star cluster on the formation and evolution of the oort cloud ( oc ) .",
    "he used a monte carlo method and two star clusters , in which the stellar encounters occurred at constant time intervals and their effects on the comets were computed analytically .",
    "the first cluster had an effective number density of 625 stars pc@xmath0 and the other had an effective number density two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "for both clusters eggers assumed a velocity dispersion of 1  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "his model did not include a tidal field caused by the cluster potential .",
    "eggers defined a comet to be in the oort cloud if it attained @xmath2  au and simultaneously @xmath3  au . with these definitions",
    ", he obtained efficiencies of 1.7% and 4.8% for the low and high density clusters respectively , with comets on orbits with a typical semi - major axis between 3000  au and 6000  au .",
    "the clouds were also found to be mostly isotropic .",
    "+ a parallel study of the formation of the inner oort cloud in a denser , clusteresque environment has been performed by fernndez & brunni ( 2000 ) .",
    "they placed comets on eccentric orbits with semi - major axes @xmath4  au and included an approximate model of the tidal field of the gas and passing stars from the cluster .",
    "the cluster had a maximum stellar number density of 100  pc@xmath0 and the maximum mass density of the core of the molecular cloud gas was 5000  @xmath5  pc@xmath0 .",
    "their simulations formed a dense inner oort cloud where the comets had semi - major axes of a few hundred to a few thousand astronomical units .",
    "the outer edge of this cloud was dependent on the density of gas and stars in the cluster .",
    "the most interesting part of their study was their ability to successfully deposit a fair amount of material that was scattered by jupiter and saturn , which were the main contributors to forming the inner oort cloud .",
    "in the current environment , on the other hand , the contribution to the oort cloud from jupiter and saturn is lower than that from uranus and neptune ( e.g. dones et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "however , fernndez & brunni ( 2000 ) pointed out that if the sun remained in this dense environment for long , the passing stars could strip a significant fraction of the comets away from the sun and the trapping efficiency might end up being low .",
    "this low trapping efficiency was partially a result of their cluster lifetimes being too long .",
    "+ the interest in the formation of the inner oort cloud in a cluster environment gained renewed interest with the discovery of ( 90377 ) sedna , a dwarf planet with semi - major axis 500  au and perihelion of 76  au , so that its orbit is detached from that of neptune ( brown et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "gladman et al . (",
    "2002 ) has shown that the object 2000 cr@xmath6 , having an orbit with @xmath7  au and @xmath8  au , could not be reproduced via chaotic diffusion , which ceases beyond @xmath9  au .",
    "thus another mechanism had to be responsible for placing both 2000 cr@xmath6 and sedna on their current orbits .",
    "morbidelli & levison ( 2004 ) , together with kenyon & bromley ( 2004 ) , successfully demonstrated that the most viable way to reproduce the orbits of sedna and 2000 cr@xmath6 is via a slow , close passage of a relatively heavy star .",
    "morbidelli & levison ( 2004 ) argued that the encounter had to happen early in order to still have a reasonably populated oort cloud afterwards .",
    "however , the low velocity of the encounter is difficult to obtain in the current galactic environment , and they suggested that this passage occurred while the sun was in its birth cluster .",
    "+ the above results led to brasser et al .",
    "( 2006 ) - henceforth bdl6 - to investigate the formation of the inner oort cloud in an embedded cluster environment , in which the gas from the molecular cloud is still present ( lada & lada , 2003 ) . inspired by fernndez & brunni ( 2000 )",
    "they attempted to constrain the environment that was needed to save comets under the dynamical control of jupiter .",
    "they employed a plummer model ( plummer , 1911 ) to construct a series of clusters with varying central density but with a more or less fixed number of stars , because most stars form in clusters of a few hundred stars ( lada & lada , 2003 ) .",
    "bdl6 used a simple leapfrog integrator for the cluster in the plummer potential and recorded the positions and velocities of stars , including time , as they came within a user - specified distance of the sun .",
    "the encounter data were then used in swift rmvs3 ( levison & duncan , 1994 ) .",
    "the latter was modified to include the effects of the stars , as in dones et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and the gravitational force from the cluster gas on the comets and the planets .",
    "the sun was assumed to be on a fixed orbit in the plummer potential from which the tidal torque of the gas on the comets was computed .",
    "the typical efficiency for the formation of the inner oort cloud was 10% .",
    "they showed that sedna s orbit could be reproduced when the central density of the cluster exceeded 10000  @xmath5  pc@xmath0 in gas and stars .",
    "for these clusters sedna was found to be at the inner edge of the inner oort cloud . in order to reproduce the orbit of 2000 cr@xmath6 , an even higher ( central )",
    "density was needed . however",
    ", the orbital distribution of the inner oort cloud in these very high density clusters is found to be inconsistent with the current observations of the outer solar system ( schwamb et al . , 2010 ) , so that the clusters where sedna is at the inner edge are preferred .",
    "+ in a similar study , kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) studied inner oort cloud formation in an open cluster with stellar number densities ranging from 10  pc@xmath0 to 100  pc@xmath0 .",
    "kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) modelled the effect of the stars using the same approach as dones et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and bdl6 .",
    "the maximum cluster life time was set to 100  myr and the density of the stars in the cluster decayed linear with time , to account for mass loss by mutual scattering of the stars .",
    "when the cluster had completely disappeared kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) continued their oort cloud simulations until the age of the solar system , something bdl6 did not do .",
    "quantitatively their results were similar to bdl6 and they were able to reproduce sedna when the stellar number density exceeded 30  pc@xmath0 .",
    "+ in a recent publication attempting to solve some of the outstanding problems associated with the oort cloud as a whole , levison et al .",
    "( 2010 ) investigated the capture by the sun of comets from other stars .",
    "they simulated embedded clusters ranging from 30 to 300 stars with a star formation efficiency of 10% to 30% .",
    "they placed a disc of comets around each star with random orientation and orbits with @xmath10  au and semi - major axes ranging from 1000 to 5000  au .",
    "the whole system of stars and comets was simulated until the median spacing between the stars became 500000  au . from these numerical simulations",
    "levison et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that the capture efficiency is high enough to obtain the current population of the oort cloud provided that most of the stars in the cluster contained a similar number of comets to the sun .",
    "at least 90% of the comets in the oort cloud could be extrasolar in origin .",
    "+ unfortunately , apart from the levison et al .",
    "( 2010 ) study , which relied on extrasolar comets rather than indigenous comets to populate the oort cloud , all of the above works suffer from the limitation that the stars are treated as hyperbolic encounters and the sun is on a fixed orbit in the cluster",
    ". both of these assumptions are wrong : the stars motion with respect to the sun reverse direction when their distance to the sun is of the same order as the size of the current oort cloud .",
    "if the stellar number density in a cloud is @xmath11  pc@xmath0 , then their average nearest - neighbour distance is @xmath12  pc , and taking a typical density of @xmath13  pc@xmath0 yields @xmath14  pc or 42000  au .",
    "secondly , mutual scattering among the stars changes their orbits and some end up on highly elliptical orbits on their way to being ejected .",
    "hence the assumption of a static orbit is no longer valid .",
    "a third issue is gas removal .",
    "bdl6 stopped their simulations after 3  myr by assuming that at this time the sun left the cluster .",
    "kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) decreased the density of their fictitious open cluster linearly and it was gone after 100  myr .",
    "levison et al . (",
    "2010 ) made the gas go away exponentially with an e - folding time of 10000 yr .",
    "fourth , the bdl6 study relied on very high central gas densities in order to torque comets under the dynamical control of jupiter into the inner oort cloud before they were ejected . while bdl6 argued that the densities that were chosen are in agreement with the peak densities observed in some embedded clusters ( gutermuth et al .",
    ", 2005 ) , their initial conditions can be improved by using more recent observational data and better models for the embedded clusters .",
    "any reasonable model of the formation of the inner oort cloud in a star cluster environment has to take the above issues into account .",
    "the aim of this paper , therefore , is to re - investigate the formation of the inner oort cloud in a cluster environment using ( i ) a better model for the embedded star cluster which best matches the current observations , in particular the initial conditions for the stars , gas and the gas dispersal , and ( ii ) a computer code that can handle stars , planets and comets at the same time so that there is no need to rely on the assumption of hyperbolic stellar encounters .",
    "+ levison et al .",
    "( 2010 ) used a computer code , based on symba ( duncan et al . , 1998 ) , that was able to integrate both the comets and stars symplectically and self - consistently without relying on assumptions of hyperbolic flybys .",
    "in this study we shall use their code .",
    "this paper is divided as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarise some of the basic properties of embedded star clusters that we need for our simulations as inferred from observations .",
    "section 3 deals with the initial conditions and methods of our numerical simulations . in section 4",
    "we present the properties of the inner oort cloud resulting from the numerical simulations . in section 5",

    "most star identification algorithms rely on the density - weighted nearest - neighbour method of casertano & hut ( 1985 ) , or the minimum spanning tree method ( e.g. graham & hell , 1985 ) .",
    "both are often employed to identify star clusters ( bastian et al . , 2007 , 2009 ; cartwright & whitworth , 2004 ; gutermuth et al . , 2009 ; schmeja & klessen , 2006 ) .",
    "however , in all cases the cluster radius is defined as the radius of a circle with the same area as the projected cluster ( schmeja , 2011 ) .",
    "all methods truncate the size of the cluster when the projected distance between two neighbouring stars is larger than some threshold value , which is equivalent to assuming that the surface density inside said circle is more or less constant .",
    "thus , the size of the cluster then obviously scales as @xmath39 .",
    "however , the @xmath39 relation appears in disagreement with another observation , and that is that the average stellar number density in these clusters is more or less constant ( carpenter , 2000 ; lada & lada , 2003 ; proszkow & adams , 2009 ) , with a median number density of @xmath40  pc@xmath0 . from the clusters listed in lada & lada ( 2003 ) and gutermuth et al .",

    "however , the average stellar number density from one cluster to the next can vary by approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "this true for both cores and halos .",
    "thus the values quoted above should be interpreted as indicative only . + it is easy to verify whether the observation of more or less constant stellar number density is consistent with the relation between the cluster s size and the number of stars .",
    "the total number of stars in the cluster , apart from a constant , is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the average stellar number density .",
    "substituting @xmath45 we have @xmath46 , which is a constant only if @xmath47 .",
    "thus it seems sensible to adopt a cluster size that scales as @xmath48 . in order to determine",
    "whether or not this scaling makes sense , we turn to observations of open and globular star clusters for guidance .",
    "+ king ( 1962 ) proposed that the size of a star cluster , whether open or globular , is given by its tidal radius , @xmath49 . at this distance from the centre ,",
    "the tidal effects of the milky way galaxy start to dominate over the self gravity of the cluster .",
    "king ( 1962 ) states that    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the gravitational constant , @xmath52 is the total mass of the cluster and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the oort constants ( e.g. binney & tremaine , 1987 ) . the tidal radius scales as @xmath48 because @xmath55 .",
    "when adopting a flat galactic rotation curve with angular velocity @xmath56  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 ( macmillan & binney , 2010 ) , we have @xmath57  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 and so @xmath58  pc , which is much larger than the halo sizes of lada & lada ( 2003 ) and gutermuth et al .",
    "this discrepancy is most likely caused by the fact that for embedded clusters the background density is not that of the galactic disc , but rather of the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "typical densities of molecular clouds are some @xmath59  m@xmath60  pc@xmath0 , so that the tidal radius in equation ( [ rt ] ) above should be divided by @xmath61 i.e. @xmath62  pc .",
    "this result is similar to and compatible with the halo distances obtained by gutermuth et al .",
    "the shape of the zero - velocity curves of the cluster reduce the tidal radius even further ( innanen et al . , 1983 ) to @xmath63  pc .",
    "given the uncertainties in the observed properties of the clusters and in the size versus number of stars , we shall anchor the value of @xmath49 for @xmath64 to the best - fit halo value of gutermuth et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and thus use @xmath65  pc for the size of the cluster .",
    "+      open and globular star clusters usually show a dense core with more or less constant surface brightness and then an extended halo where the surface density falls off ( king , 1962 ) , typically as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 ( king , 1962 ; elson et al . , 1987 ) .",
    "observers generally define the cluster core radius , @xmath68 , as the distance from the cluster centre at which the surface brightness drops by a factor of two from the central value .",

    "the core radius is then given by ( king , 1966 )    @xmath71    which we shall use here .",
    "for most cluster models the core radius corresponds roughly to where the stellar volume density has decreased by a factor of 3 .",
    "a second method computes a local density using a star s nearest neighbours ( casertano & hut 1985 ) , in which the core radius becomes a density - weighted quantity obtained from the root - mean - square stellar distances .",

    "( 2010 ) for a more in - depth discussion on how the core radius is defined and measured .",

    "observations indicate that in the youngest embedded clusters the velocities of starless clumps and young stellar objects are a fraction of the virial value .",
    "thus , the orbits of stars are mostly radial .",

    "have even lower values .",
    "indeed , some of the pre - stellar cumps and some young stellar objects in these clusters appear to exhibit a collapse because of the low speeds .",

    "+ the last issue we discuss is mass segregation .",
    "massive stars are believed to sink to the cluster center over a relatively long time scale , given approximately by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the dynamical relaxation time , and @xmath104 is the mass of the star in solar masses ( portegies zwart , 2009 ) .",
    "of course , the massive stars can also be formed at the cluster centres , and some observational evidence ( testi et al .",
    "2000 ; peretto et al . , 2006 ) and theoretical considerations ( bonnell & davies 1998 ; mckee & tan , 2003 ) support this point of view . however , allison et al .",
    "( 2009 ) report very rapid mass segregation if the initial structure of the cluster is sufficiently fractal and the velocities are highly subvirial , typical for these young clusters . in their study of these highly fractal clusters with subvirial velocities ,",
    "mass segregation was achieved for stars heavier than 5  @xmath5 and completed in approximately 1  myr .",
    "this rapid mass segregation appears consistent with observations of the orion nebula cluster ( hillenbrand & hartmann , 1998 ; moeckel & bonnell , 2009 ) . in this study",
    "we consider clusters which are already mass segregated for stars heavier than 5  @xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that the rapid mass segregation coincides with a violent relaxation phase after the gravitational collapse , both of which are a result of its subvirial velocities , as the cluster tries to reach equipartition . as it does so it shrinks in size by approximately a factor two or more ( allison et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "in this study we do not concern ourselves with the mechanism behind mass segregation , whether it is through dynamics or by formation , but assume it has already happened for stars heavier than 5  @xmath5 .",

    "proszkow & adams ( 2009 ) removed the gas instantaneously at times ranging from 1  myr to 7  myr , to account for the spread in observed embedded cluster lifetimes .",
    "levison et al . ( 2010 ) kept the gas density constant for 3  myr and removed it exponentially with an e - folding time of 10000  yr .",
    "thus , previous studies show great variability in their choice of the time of gas removal and its decay rate .",
    "an initially bound cluster responds to external perturbations and changes in the potential in approximately a crossing time and thus this time scale serves as a bench mark .",
    "kroupa ( 2000 ) reports that typically the gas in an embedded cluster is removed on a crossing time",
    ". however , for our purposes we do not want to end up with a bound system of which the sun is a potential member , and thus we would like to take the gas away quickly to ensure that the sun escapes from the system .",
    "even though proszkow & adams ( 2009 ) took the gas away instantaneously , they frequently found that bound systems remained .",
    "the strongest dependency appears to be on the star formation efficiency , @xmath118 , but even when setting @xmath142 , they reported that some 15% of systems remained bound after the gas went away .",
    "ultimately , the gas in the cluster is removed because stellar winds from heavy stars create h@xmath36 bubbles and supernovae .",
    "stellar winds cause rapid outflow of h@xmath36 bubbles , typically with velocities of @xmath143  km  s@xmath1 ( whitmore et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this leads to a removal time scale of @xmath144  yr , for clusters with @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "given this rapid time scale , we have decided to proceed as follows : the gas is kept at its initial density for a time of either 2  myr or 4  myr . given that the typical lifetime of an embedded cluster is some 5  myr ( lada & lada , 2003 ) with a maximum of 10  myr , and that circumstellar discs have a median lifetime of 3  myr ( currie et al .",
    ", 2008 ) , and that jupiter and saturn had to form in this time ( lissauer & stevenson , 2007 ) , a typical cluster lifetime after the formation of jupiter and saturn of 1  myr to 5  myr is reasonable .",
    "after the constant density phase , the density of the gas decays exponentially with an e - folding time of @xmath146  yr .",
    "+      star clusters are not well - suited to the symplectic integration methods typically used to follow the orbits of comets about stars ( spurzem et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "these methods split the hamiltonian into the sum of a part representing keplerian motion around a fixed star and a part representing the non - keplerian perturbations from other stars ( wisdom & holman , 1991 ) .",
    "however , we find that the orbits of the stars and other bodies are efficiently computed using the standard ` leap - frog ' integrator , which is a second - order symplectic integrator where the hamiltonian is split into the sum of a part representing the kinetic energy and one representing the gravitational potential energy . as described in duncan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the key idea is to incorporate a multiple time step symplectic method such that whenever two or more stars , or a comet and star(s ) , or comet and planet suffer close encounters , the time step for the relevant bodies is recursively divided to whatever level is required to resolve the encounter . in other words ,",
    "the code splits the encounter into a series of shells which duncan et al .",

    "1998 ) , we modified it to use the leap - frog scheme . from now on this new code will be referred to as symbac . for a description of tests of the code without planets",
    "we refer to levison et al .",
    "+ including the jovian planets orbiting the sun in symbac proved to be tricky .",
    "the leap - frog integration scheme is not very accurate for kepler orbits unless one takes of the order of 1000 steps per orbit ( kokubo et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "however , even with such a small time step it introduces a secular drift in the argument of pericentre , @xmath148 , of the planets ( kokubo et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this drifting in @xmath148 changes the secular properties of the planets and it is easy to grow the eccentricities of jupiter and saturn to crossing values .",
    "one solution to this problem is to invent a new symplectic method to handle both kepler orbits and stellar encounters , or to search for a set of parameters that keep the planets stable .",
    "we chose to do the latter .",
    "it turned out that it is imperative to keep jupiter and saturn on the same shell , and that the shells are scaled as @xmath149 and the time step between shells is divided by 6 .",
    "the first shell around the sun is set to 2916  au and the time step is 100  yr , and is used for all of the calculations that follow . since the typical spacing between the stars is much larger than 3000  au , encounters between stars are relatively rare and the code does not often need to resort to the recursive encounter routines apart from in the beginning when there are many comets close to the sun .",
    "hence the simulations we performed were finished in mere hours rather than days or weeks .",
    "as in bdl6 we do not include uranus and neptune , because their formation mechanism is still not well understood and the time scale of their formation is not well constrained ( goldreich et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "+ comets were added only around the sun as bodies with masses thirteen orders of magnitude smaller than the stars and planets .",
    "the stars and planets mutually interact , but the comets are only affected by the stars and the planets , and not by each other .",

    "a total of 4000 comets were used in each simulation . in order to hasten the evolution , we removed comets from the simulation when they were farther than 1.5@xmath49 from the cluster centre and unbound . in order to keep the calculations traceable , and because we are only interested in the formation of the inner oort cloud with indigenous comets , no comets were added around other stars , unlike in levison et al .",
    "the simulations were stopped either after some maximum time ( 15  myr ) or when the sun was farther than 1.5@xmath49 from the cluster centre after the gas began to evaporate .",

    "a total of 40 simulations were performed for each cluster , with 10 for each combination of the time the gas density remained constant , @xmath150 , and the concentration @xmath74 . together with the two values of the sfe and the two potential / density pairs , this results in a total of 1120 simulations , which were all performed on the crimson beowulf cluster at the observatoire de la cte dazur .      in this subsection",

    "this sequence of events , in which the cluster collapses and then expands again , occurs in all our simulations .",
    "+ now that we have given a brief overview of the dynamical evolution of the star clusters , we turn to the results of our simulations of stars and comets .",
    "in this section we present the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "many properties of the inner oort cloud that are formed in this way are similar to earlier results presented in fernndez & brunni ( 2000 ) , bdl6 and kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) , such as the the cloud being nearly isotropic apart from the inner 10% or so .",
    "we shall not repeat all of these here but instead only focus on the key aspects and how these scale with the cluster properties : the distribution in semi - major axis , inclination and perihelion , the location of the inner edge and the formation efficiency . during this investigation it became clear that the parameter space is very large ,",
    "so we shall try to reduce it first .",
    "when examining the output from the simulations , it turned out that the initial virial ratio , @xmath99 , does not impact the results beyond the statistical noise one expects from one simulation to another .",
    "this result is surprising , because the value of @xmath99 determines how much the cluster shrinks during the initial collapse and violent relaxation .",
    "thus , in what follows we consider the results to be averaged over the value of @xmath99 .",
    "this leaves us with the number of stars , @xmath15 , the star - formation efficiency , @xmath118 , the time the gas was removed , @xmath150 , the concentration , @xmath74 , and the density profile ( plummer or hernquist ) . for reference ,",
    "a comet is defined to be in the cloud if it satisfies both @xmath156  au and @xmath157  au . +      a simple way to depict the size and distance of the inner oort cloud to the sun is to plot the cumulative semi - major axis distribution of comets that are in the cloud .",
    "we have plotted this distribution for hernquist clusters with 50 , 250 , 500 and 1000 stars ( fig .  [ cumah ] ) and plummer ( fig .  [ cumap ] ) distributions respectively .",
    "both figures correspond to clusters with an sfe of 10% .",
    "the red lines are for clusters with @xmath158  myr and @xmath76 , green lines have @xmath153  myr and @xmath76 , the blue lines correspond to the parameters @xmath158  myr with @xmath77 , while the magenta lines depict cases with @xmath153  myr and @xmath77 .",
    "we will use these @xmath159-colour correlations throughout the paper , unless specified otherwise .",
    "the plots show a few interesting features that require further discussion .",
    "+    the first is that , generally but not exclusively , the magenta lines precede the blue lines , which precede the green lines , which in turn precede the red lines . in other words ,",
    "the inner oort clouds formed above become more centrally condensed when both @xmath150 and @xmath74 increase .",
    "this is easy to imagine .",
    "as the sun resides in the cluster for longer times , the outermost comets are stripped away by encounters with the other stars .",
    "only the tightest - bound comets survive these encounters over long times because stars need to come ever closer to destabilise the close - in comets .",
    "in addition , as the sun spends more time in the cluster , the tidal forces from the gas and stars have more time to torque the comets perihelia away from the planets . since this time scale is @xmath160 ( duncan et al . , 1987 ) ,",
    "spending more time in the cluster will torque comets at smaller semi - major axis .",
    "the same argument holds for the torquing of the comets perihelia by stellar encounters . secondly , ignoring the red curve in the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ cumah ] , where the sun suffered a very close encounter with another star early on , the range of the curves of the same colour are similar among all the panels of each model .",
    "however , when comparing the hernquist and plummer clouds , for the hernquist model the range of the clouds is from approximately 200  au to 200000  au ( where we truncated it ) , while for plummer the clouds are farther away , starting at about 800  au .",
    "this makes sense : the central density in the hernquist model is higher than that in the plummer model and thus as the sun flies through the centre of the cluster the torquing by the gas and the encounters with the other stars in the hernquist model are more violent than in the plummer model .",
    "a third interesting feature is that the cumulative distributions have a similar shape and appear just different in their median values .",
    "it appears as if both stochastic effects from one simulation to the next and the number of stars in the cluster affects the final distribution .",
    "kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) also reported that their results suffered from strong stochastic effects from one simulation to the next .",
    "we examined the cumulative semi - major axis distributions for clusters with an sfe of 0.25 and conclude that they are very similar to the figures shown above . +    in order to characterise the oort clouds better , in fig .  [ ocfig ]",

    "the data are accumulated over a series of clusters with different @xmath15 .",
    "the top two panels pertain to hernquist models while the bottom two panels are for plummer clusters .",
    "note that the plummer clusters are less centrally concentrated than the hernquist clusters .",
    "note also that unlike the traditional oort cloud , which has an inner edge at approximately 2000  au ( e.g. dones et al .",
    ", 2004 , kaib & quinn , 2008 ) the oort cloud formed in the cluster environment can extend all the way down to @xmath161200  au so that the cluster environment produces an oort cloud that is much more centrally condensed . +",
    "the differences among the cumulative distributions are a measure of the concentration of the cloud .",
    "unfortunately there is no definite way to define this from the cumulative distributions of the semi - major axis .",
    "however , we might turn to the theory of star clusters for guidance .",
    "in analogy with star clusters , a useful way to characterise the central concentration of the inner oort cloud is by considering the number density of the comets as a function of semi - major axis .",
    "this is similar to counting the stars in a cluster as a function of their projected distance to the centre .",
    "the number density of the comets as a function of the semi - major axis , @xmath162 , can be well approximated by a power law when far from the sun , and the slope is usually -@xmath163 or @xmath164 ( duncan et al .",
    ", 1987 ; dones et al . , 2004 ;",
    "bdl6 ; kaib & quinn , 2008 ) , while close to the sun the density is usually flat ( e.g. brasser et al . ,",

    "we know that in a plummer cluster the torquing on the comet is a maximum when @xmath196 .",

    "as one can see , there is little variation among the distributions with either @xmath15 , @xmath150 or @xmath74 .",
    "all clouds are predominantly prograde since the median value of @xmath197 is larger than 0 .",
    "if the inclination distribution were isotropic , then a cumulative distribution of @xmath197 would be a straight line from 0 to 1 as @xmath197 goes from 1 to @xmath198 .",
    "as one can see , this is not the case for most distributions and thus the inner oort cloud is not ( yet ) isotropic .",
    "that said , the median inclination is lower in the inner parts of the cloud and higher in the outermost parts ( not shown ) .",
    "however , even in the innermost part ( less than 10% in cumulative semi - major axis ) the median value of the inclination is typically between 45@xmath199 and 55@xmath199 .",

    "this implies that most comets are found with small perihelion relative to the semi - major axis .",
    "this is no surprise for two reasons .",
    "first the galactic tide has not had time to randomise the @xmath200 distribution .",
    "second , the innermost part of the oort cloud i.e. comets with @xmath204  au , are barely affected by the galactic tides even on gyr time scales ( dones et al . , 2004 ; bdl6 )",
    ", so we expect both the perihelion and inclination distributions to be preserved in this region .",
    "+ when examining the inclination and perihelion distributions for the plummer clusters , they turn out to be very similar to those for the hernquist clusters .",
    "this is to be expected because these distributions have not been evolved to the present age and thus the galactic tide has not had time to mix the inclinations and eccentricities of the comets . regarding the cumulative eccentricity distribution , which is not shown , we find the cumulative distribution scales as @xmath205 , with @xmath206 .",
    "a thermal distribution has the cumulative @xmath207 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the semi - major axis and eccentricity distributions varies from -0.07 to 0.05 , suggesting no trend of the eccentricity to either increase or decrease with increasing semi - major axis . between the semi - major axis and inclination distributions , the spearman rank correlation coefficient is approximately 0.25 , suggesting a weak trend for the inclination to increase with increasing semi - major axis .",
    "we verified this by noting that the inner portion of the oort cloud has a lower median inclination than the outer part .",
    "in bdl6 we argued that comets with semi - major axis @xmath204  au are barely affected by the galactic tide because the average rotation rate of their apses is governed by planetary perturbations rather than the galactic tide .",
    "therefore , it is likely that this population has preserved its original orbital structure since its formation during the time the sun was in a cluster .",
    "we call this population the fossilised inner oort cloud , and its most prominent member is sedna , with 2000 cr@xmath6  @xmath208  and 2004 vn@xmath209  @xmath210  being potential other members . the high - inclination objects ( 136199 ) eris and 2004 xr@xmath211 ( buffy )",

    "here we are interested in the orbital distribution of objects in this fossilised inner oort cloud in order to directly compare it with observations .",
    "however , before proceeding there are a few issues that we have to consider .",
    "+ recently schwamb et al .",
    "( 2010 ) attempted to constrain some of the properties of the sun s birth cluster by comparing recent deep - field observations with palomar of trans - neptunian objects with the simulations presented in bdl6 .",
    "schwamb et al .",
    "( 2010 ) concluded that the current environment of the outer solar system is incompatible with the two densest clusters from bdl6 with a confidence of 95% or better ; they were unable to reject the next - densest clusters , with central density @xmath212  @xmath5  pc@xmath0 , for which sedna was always at the inner edge .",
    "this should help us put some crude constraints on the cluster models employed in the current study that are compatible with the data from schwamb et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and which are not .",
    "re - examining the data from bdl6 we find that for the @xmath213  @xmath5  pc@xmath0 clusters sedna is located at the 3% level in cumulative semi - major axis , and the innermost object has a semi - major axis of 218  au . for the denser clusters the inner edge is closer in . however , how can we distinguish between objects that were placed on their current orbits by a stellar encounter and by planetary actions , in particular during the late epoch of planetary instability where neptune most likely temporarily resided on a highly eccentric orbit ( tsiganis et al . , 2005 )",
    "? gomes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and gomes ( 2011 ) have demonstrated that the combined effect of mean - motion resonances with neptune and the kozai mechanism ( kozai , 1962 ) can place objects from the scattered disc on orbits with a high inclination ( up to 50@xmath199 ) and large pericentre distance ( more than 40  au ) , mimicking a fossilised inner oort cloud object that was perturbed by a star .",
    "in addition , as neptune migrated and its eccentricity decreased through dynamical friction , some objects detached from is resonances or sphere of influence and now permanently reside on high - perihelion , high - inclination orbits ( gomes et al . , 2005 ; gomes , 2011 ) . however , the combined effects of mean - motion resonances and the kozai mechanism breaks down when the mean - motion resonances with neptune begin to overlap , which occurs for semi - major axes larger than 200 to 250  au ( gomes et al . , 2005 ; lykawka & mukai , 2007 ) .",
    "thus any object with a semi - major axis longer than this value , and a pericentre distance farther than 38  au  beyond which chaotic diffusion stops ( gladman et al . ,",
    "2002 )  could be a fossilised inner oort cloud object .",
    "therefore , for our purpose , we eliminate objects with semi - major axis shorter than 250  au and perihelia lower than 38  au .",
    "+ the cumulative distributions of the inclination and pericentre distance for the fossilised inner oort cloud are very similar to those depicted in figs .",

    "the bottom - left panel displays the inclination distribution clearly indicating the prograde bias , while the bottom - right panel plots the semi - major axis vs pericentre distance .",
    "here we report the formation efficiency of the inner oort cloud from our numerical simulations .",

    "as is clear , the typical efficiency does not depend strongly on the properties of the cluster but remains at approximately 1.5% .",
    "bdl6 reported typical efficiencies of 10% although kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) obtained efficiencies of typically 3% during their open cluster phase , which are in better agreement with our current value .",
    "in addition , the results of kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) do not strongly depend on their cluster properties either .",
    "we can not pinpoint the exact reason for the significant difference in the trapping efficiency between our current simulations and those presented in bdl6 although we can present a plausible argument .",
    "+ kaib & quinn ( 2008 ) argued that their resulting inner oort clouds and efficiencies were very strongly dependent on the closest stellar passage through their oort clouds .",
    "if this passage happened late then there would be little material left in the oort cloud or the scattered disc to refill the cloud ( levison et al . ,",
    "in addition , in bdl6 the orbit of the sun remained fixed in the plummer potential and were obtained from a cluster in virial equilibrium , so that most orbits had a small radial excursion . since the sun stayed near the plummer radius the fluctuations in density and flux of stellar encounters that the sun experienced were limited .",
    "here this is not the case : the sun s orbit is nearly radial so that it passes close to the cluster centre before receding back into the halo after the initial phase of violent relaxation .",
    "thus the sun does not stay close to the plummer or hernquist radius and , especially in the latter clusters , experiences a change in background density of at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the passages through the centre of cluster occur after 1 to 3 myr , by which time the number of comets that are being scattered by jupiter and saturn has decreased by as much as 80% .",

    "then there are not many comets left to resupply the oort cloud and thus the corresponding efficiency is low . this efficiency",
    "could possibly be increased by adding uranus and neptune and having them scatter the comets in their vicinity .",
    "however their formation mechanism and time scale is not well understood ( goldreich et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "thus we have reason to believe that the efficiencies that we obtained here are in agreement with the expected dynamics . + is the existence of sedna in agreement with a typical trapping efficiency of 1.5% ?",
    "levison et al . ( 2008 ) and morbidelli et al . ( 2009 ) estimate that there were approximately 1000 pluto - sized objects in the trans - neptunian disc .",
    "since the mass in this disc is probably comparable to that in the jupiter - saturn region , we also estimate that there were some 1000 pluto - sized objects in this region . taking the size distribution for large kuiper belt objects from bernstein et al . (",
    "2004 ) , with a cumulative slope of 3.5 , we estimate there were approximately 4000 sedna - sized objects shortly after the formation of jupiter and saturn .",
    "if only 1.5% of these ended up in the oort cloud , this implies there are some 60 sedna - sized objects in the oort cloud , and thus we can expect to see one of these in the innermost 2% of the cloud . thus , our low formation efficiency is compatible with the detection of one sedna - like object .",
    "however , this estimate is uncertain by factors of a few because of the lack of knowledge of the primordial number of sedna - like objects in the jupiter - saturn region .",
    "+ in the next section we better compare the compatibility of our cluster models with a single detection of sedna .",
    "in this section we compare the orbital distribution of sedna - like bodies produced in the above cluster environments to the observational constraints the wide - field survey of schwamb et al .",

    "after a few myr of evolution , star formation in onc - like settings occurs mainly in photo - dissociation regions where the hii region created by the central star and the surrounding molecular gas meet , which is at a few parsecs from the massive star . the fate of the onc is well illustrated by the 2 - 3 myr old cluster ngc 2244 , whose most massive star has the same spectral type as @xmath231 c ori . in ngc 2244 ,",

    "to our knowledge no n - body simulations of star clusters containing gas take into account the motion of and the related changes in the gas .",
    "doing so would most likely require a hybrid study of n - body for the stars , planets and comets , and hydrodynamics for the gas .",
    "this would be a completely new study in star cluster dynamics far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "+ a second issue concerns the initial conditions of the cluster . for this study we chose to artificially have",
    "the stars reach their final masses at the same time , while in reality this occurs over a certain time span .",
    "the sequential star formation could prevent the early violent relaxation phase of the cluster and thus the dynamics would be milder .",
    "adams et al .",
    "( 2006 ) incorporated the sequential star formation by adding the stars one by one to his simulations over a time span of 1  myr .",
    "levison et al . ( 2010 ) randomised the phases of the stars by integrating the whole cluster in the hernquist potential for 1  myr .",
    "but , as we argued earlier , there is no definitive piece of evidence that supports either sequential star formation or having most of the stars in the cluster form at more or less the same time .",
    "further study is needed to support either mechanism and how it would impact the outer parts of the solar system .",
    "+ one additional issue that we need to address is the problem of when is @xmath235 ? in our simulations , @xmath235 corresponds to when jupiter and saturn have fully formed and begin to scatter the comets in their vicinity .",
    "here we assume that their time scale of formation is short compared to the free fall time of the sun in the cluster .",
    "the free fall time is given by @xmath236  myr .",
    "a typical number density in the centre of the clusters is @xmath237  pc@xmath0 ( carpenter , 2000 ) , which implies @xmath238  @xmath5  pc@xmath0 . taking the sfe to be 0.1 we have @xmath239  myr , which is more or less the time when the cluster reaches it maximum density in fig .",
    "the formation of jupiter and saturn is thought to have taken between 1  myr and 3  myr ( lissauer & stevenson , 2007 ) and observations indicate that circumstellar gas discs have a typical lifetime of 3  myr ( currie et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the sun had already passed through the centre of the cluster at least once before the formation of jupiter and saturn had been completed . would including jupiter , saturn and the comets after this initial passage dramatically change the outcome of our simulations ?",
    "we do not think so because the sun will still have a radial orbit and continue to experience a few passages through the cluster centre before the gas is blown away by stellar winds .",
    "given that the first passage deposits most of the comets in the cloud and is also the most damaging , we believe that the outcome will be similar to what we have presented here . + the last issue we would like to address is whether or not our model predicts more sednas .",
    "as we discussed in section  5 , the existence of sedna can not rule out the current cluster model . to our knowledge",

    "if there are more objects in this region brighter than or equal to sedna , then we expect there to be of the order of several to a few hundred more bodies of similar size , similar to our predictions from section 5 .",
    "however , the final outcome depends on the slope of the size distribution .",
    "if the slope is steep then we expect there to be many more similar objects in this region , but if the size distribution is rather shallow then maybe only a single or handful of objects detectable .",

    "we have performed a series of numerical simulations of the formation of the inner oort cloud in an embedded cluster environment .",

    "this difference is no surprise because the hernquist clusters are more centrally condensed . for the current oort cloud which formed in the current galactic environment",
    "the concentration radius is approximately 5000  au .",
    "* the concentration radius increases with increasing number of stars in the cluster , so that more populated clusters form less compact inner oort clouds .",
    "the reason for this is the smaller volume of phase space that the sun can occupy to pass close enough to the centre to experience the necessary high density and torquing to deposit the comets in the cloud . *",
    "the location of the dwarf planet sedna at 500  au is usually within the inner 5% of the cloud for hernquist clusters , and within the innermost 2% of the cloud for plummer clusters , in agreement with the idea that it is at the inner edge of the inner oort cloud . *",
    "almost all the orbital distributions of the clusters are consistent with a single detection of a sedna - like body , and can not be rejected at greater than the 90@xmath227 confidence level for the entire range of the size distribution slopes that were tested . in other words , from the position of sedna and a comparison with the current structure of the outer solar system we can not constrain the number of stars in the cluster . *",
    "the inner oort clouds formed in these clusters are not isotropic , but show a slight prograde preference with a median inclination of approximately 50@xmath199 .",
    "the inner part is significantly more prograde while the outer part is slightly retrograde . *",
    "the perihelion distribution is flat in @xmath203 , so that most inner oort cloud objects have small perihelia compared to their semi - major axis .",
    "* we examine the ` fossilised inner oort cloud ' , which is the region inside approximately 2000  au where the galactic tide has barely altered the orbital elements of the comets .",
    "we find that the distributions in inclination , perihelion and semi - major axis are similar than for the whole cloud .",
    "in this region we expect these distributions to be preserved because the galactic tide does not randomise the inclinations and eccentricities .",
    "the median perihelion distance is @xmath242  au for plummer and @xmath4  au for hernquist . *",
    "the typical formation efficiency of the oort cloud is 1.5% , lower than previous estimates , but consistent with a single detection of sedna .",

    "<S> 2006 ) with several substantial modifications . first , the system consisting of stars , planets and comets is treated self - consistently in our n - body simulations , rather than approximating the stellar encounters with the outer solar system as hyperbolic fly - bys . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have included the expulsion of the cluster gas , a feature that was absent previously . </S>",
    "<S> third , we have used several models for the initial conditions and density profile of the cluster  either a hernquist or plummer potential  and chose other parameters based on the latest observations of embedded clusters from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> these other parameters result in the stars being on radial orbits and the cluster collapses . </S>",
    "<S> similar to previous studies , in our simulations the inner oort cloud is formed from comets being scattered by jupiter and saturn and having their pericentres decoupled from the planets by perturbations from the cluster gas and other stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all inner oort clouds formed in these clusters have an inner edge ranging from 100  au to a few hundred au , and an outer edge at over 100000  au , with little variation in these values for all clusters . </S>",
    "<S> all inner oort clouds formed are consistent with the existence of ( 90377 ) sedna , an inner oort cloud dwarf planetoid , at the inner edge of the cloud : sedna tends to be at the innermost 2% for plummer models , while it is 5% for hernquist models . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that the existence of sedna is a generic outcome . </S>",
    "<S> we define a ` concentration radius ' for the inner oort cloud and find that its value increases with increasing number of stars in the cluster , ranging from 600  au to 1500  au for hernquist clusters and from 1500  au to 4000  au for plummer clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing trend implies that small star clusters form more compact inner oort clouds than large clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we are unable to constrain the number of stars that resided in the cluster since most clusters yield inner oort clouds that could be compatible with the current structure of the outer solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the typical formation efficiency of the inner oort cloud is 1.5% , significantly lower than previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the more violent dynamics that the sun experiences as it rushes through the centre of the cluster during the latter s initial phase of violent relaxation .    </S>",
