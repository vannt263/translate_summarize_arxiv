    ", the interaction - induced level shifts can suppress resonant optical excitation of multiple rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "a collection of atoms in the corresponding blockade volume then forms a `` superatom '' which can accommodate at most one shared rydberg excitation @xcite .",
    "the rydberg blockade mechanism constitutes the basis for a number of promising quantum information schemes @xcite and interesting multiatom effects @xcite .",
    "resonant two - photon excitation of rydberg states is employed in several schemes @xcite utilizing the effects of atomic coherence , such as electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite and coherent population trapping and transfer @xcite .",
    "stimulated adiabatic passage with delayed pulses in an ensemble of three - level atoms was previously considered in @xcite , where all the atomic states were assumed to be stable , while the lower atomic transition was driven either by a microwave field or by a pair of optical fields in the raman configuration .",
    "it was shown that , under the rydberg blockade , the application of the `` counterintuitive '' pulse sequence results in a multiatom entangled state with strongly correlated population of the two lower states .    the purpose of the present work is to investigate the more typical experimental situation @xcite in which both transitions of three - level atoms are driven by optical fields in a ladder ( @xmath0 ) configuration , while the intermediate excited state of the atoms undergoes rapid spontaneous decay . for non - interacting ( distant ) atoms , the situation is analogous to what is usually referred to as stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) in a @xmath1-configuration @xcite . adding interatomic interactions leads to highly non - trivial behavior of the rydberg superatom . in the earlier part of the process , the system is in a completely symmetric superposition of @xmath2 atoms , each undergoing adiabatic passage towards the rydberg state without populating the intermediate excited state .",
    "but once any one atom is excited to the rydberg state , it blocks further rydberg excitations and triggers the cycling excitation and decay of the intermediate excited state of all the other @xmath3 atoms .",
    "this destroys the interatomic coherences and dephases the single rydberg excitation which therefore decouples from the field . through the exact solution of the @xmath2-atom master equation , we obtain at the end of the process a mixed state of the system with a single rydberg excitation incoherently shared among all @xmath2 atoms .",
    "we can also understand the underlying physical mechanism in terms of the quantum zeno effect @xcite , in which atoms emitting spontaneous photons through the decay of the intermediate excited state reveal that interactions block their adiabatic passage towards the rydberg state and thereby perform frequent projective measurements of the presence of a rydberg excitation in the ensemble .",
    "remarkably , the larger is the number of atoms within the blockade volume the more robust is the transfer process resulting in a single rydberg excitation of the superatom .",
    "let us first recall the essence of adiabatic transfer of population in an isolated three - level atom using a pair of delayed laser pulses ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "a coherent optical field with rabi frequency @xmath4 resonantly couples the stable ground state @xmath5 to an unstable ( decaying ) excited state @xmath6 , which in turn is resonantly coupled to another stable state @xmath7 by the second coherent field of rabi frequency @xmath8 [ fig .",

    "the `` dark '' state @xmath14 with energy @xmath15 does not have any contribution from the fast decaying state @xmath6 , while the `` bright '' states @xmath16 having energies @xmath17 do contain @xmath6 and thus are unstable against spontaneous decay .",
    "the aim of the stirap process is to completely transfer the population between the two stable states @xmath5 and @xmath7 without populating the unstable state @xmath6 , which is achieved by adiabatically changing the dark state superposition . with the system initially in state @xmath5 , one first applies the @xmath8 field , resulting in @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and therefore @xmath20 ) .",

    "if the mixing angle is rotated slowly enough , @xmath24 , the system adiabatically follows the dark state @xmath14 , and the bright states @xmath16 , and thereby @xmath6 , are never populated .",
    "hence , the decay of @xmath6 is neutralized and the population of the system is completely transferred from @xmath5 to @xmath7 . for what follows , it is useful to remember that the dark state @xmath14 does not contain @xmath6 because the resonant coupling of @xmath5 to @xmath6 by @xmath4 interferes destructively with the resonant coupling of @xmath7 to @xmath6 by @xmath8 .     and @xmath8 on the transitions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are ( population ) decay rates of states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "the evolution is interrupted by random quantum jumps @xmath132 with probabilities determined by the decay rates @xmath133 .    in the early part of evolution , the states of all the atoms share the same overlap with the current dark and bright states , and the state of the system @xmath129 is symmetric under permutation of the atoms .",
    "but already the first quantum jump breaks this symmetry by transferring one randomly selected atom from @xmath6 to @xmath5 ( or , with a much smaller probability @xmath134 , from @xmath7 to @xmath6 ) , while the dark state overlap increases for the atoms that did not jump . during the subsequent evolution under the rydberg blockade",
