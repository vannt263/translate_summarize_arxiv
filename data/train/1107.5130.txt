    "blazars are flat radio spectrum active galactic nuclei that are dominated by the nonthermal emissions of superluminal moving bulk plasma blobs emitted from the core @xcite .",
    "their strong high energy emissions show a characteristic double bump structure in their spectra @xcite . in leptonic models ,",
    "the lower energy bump is caused by synchrotron emission while the bump at higher energies is produced by inverse compton - scattering . according to synchrotron self compton models ( ssc ) synchrotron photons",
    "are produced by accelerated particles in the jet , while gamma ray photons arise from the inverse compton - scattered synchrotron photons @xcite .",
    "however , external photons that are not produced inside the jet can also be scattered by the inverse compton effect and can contribute to the emission .",
    "external compton models ( ec ) consider photons from the accretion disk or the broad line region @xcite while conventional one zone ssc models consider the emission in the blob as homogeneous .",
    "these models assume that the variability of blazar emissions is limited by the size of the blob .",
    "in contrast , two zone ssc models @xcite allow for shorter variabilities but only spatially resolved models are suitable for even shorter variabilities .",
    "they take angular dependent properties of the jet into account like the direction of magnetic fields and spatial variations of electron and photon densities inside the blob .    in this paper",
    "we consider spatially resolved ssc models with an ec component and are interested in ascertaining the angular radiation characteristics of the ec component .",
    "@xcite assumed that this beaming pattern is produced by a relativistic moving blob consisting of isotropic distributed electrons that thomson - scatter photons from an external isotropic radiation field . as a result",
    "the isotropic external photons are more strongly boosted than isotropically distributed photons in a blob within the jet .",
    "while dermer s calculations are based on ultrarelativistic electrons and scattering in the thomson regime , in this paper we will consider all possible electron energies obeying the thomson as well as the klein - nishina regime .",
    "using the exact klein - nishina cross section we compute the distribution of scattered photons numerically , examine the dependencies of physical parameters and determine the resulting intensity for an electron distribution given by a power law . such a calculation",
    "has already been executed by @xcite but in contrast to them we do not use the formula of the scattered photons by @xcite that averages over the photons emergent angles .",
    "in fact we will inherit the first steps of jones exact calculation , i.e. not relying on the head on approximation , and continue using exact expressions .",
    "we organize the remaining paper as follows . in section [ sec_calc ]",
    "the necessary steps are shown to calculate the scattered spectrum exactly . in section",
    "[ sec_results ] the results in the blob frame as well in the observer s frame are presented and compared to both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section we explain the calculation of the spectrum arising from the isotropically distributed , monoenergetic photons of energy @xmath2 , that have been compton - scattered by the homogeneous electrons in the moving blob . in the remainder of this work",
    "all quantities in the electron rest frame will be primed , while quantities in the blob frame are unprimed and quantities in the observer s frame are annotated by a star .",
    "the photon and electron energies are given in units of the electron rest energy @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig_angles ] illustrates the use of relative and absolute angles in the restframe of the blob , the blob frame . the differential number of compton scattered photons of energy @xmath4 in the blob frame given by @xmath5 whereas @xmath6 is the incident photon distribution , @xmath7 the isotropic electron distribution and @xmath8 the full klein - nishina cross section .",
    "we evaluate this expression in several steps :    firstly , the resulting photon distribution in the blob frame is analytically calculated when a photon of energy @xmath9 ( emerging from @xmath10 ) compton - scatters an electron of energy @xmath11 ( emerging from @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath13 the incident photon distribution is given by @xmath14 and we assume the incident photons emerging from @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the dirac delta function .",

    "@xmath29 we checked the accuracy of the results by revisiting the properties of compton - scattering , e.g. forward scattering for only @xmath30 or the maximal energy gained by scattering .",
    "thirdly , we assume an incident monoenergetic isotropic photon distribution in the observer s frame @xmath31 and transform it into the blob frame @xmath32 this allows us to integrate the obtained result in equation ( [ eq_electronangle ] ) over the incident photon distribution @xmath33 .",
    "for that purpose the emergent solid angle @xmath34 is rotated with respect to the considered incident photon direction @xmath10 , i.e. the new @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 represents the rotation operator with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath37 the integration over all directions ( @xmath10 ) and energies ( @xmath9 ) is done numerically .",
    "fourthly , we assume the energetic distribution of the electrons as @xmath38 and consider energies ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath40 . in order to integrate over the electron energies each number of electrons of energy @xmath11 is multiplied by the respective calculated differential number of the compton - scattered photons in the third step ( cf . equation ( [ eq_photons ] ) ) .",
    "the obtained values are summed up for all energies @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath41 finally , we transform the resulting differential photon distribution expressed in the blob frame into the observer s frame using @xmath42 the intensity is yielded by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the volume of the blob and @xmath45 its area perpendicular to the moving direction of the blob .",
    "the characteristic spectrum of the compton - scattered photons is a broadened peak if we assume an isotropic electron distribution in the blob frame .",
    "when plotting the spectrum on a double logarithmic scale graph , two characteristic areas show up .",
    "these are the regime of elastic scattering , i.e. the thomson regime , and the regime of inelastic scattering , i.e. the klein - nishina regime . defining the electron distribution by a spectral index @xmath1 the differential number of photons in the thomson regime depends on @xmath46 . in the klein - nishina regime the spectral index is characterized by a higher spectral index .",
    "choosing an electron distribution of @xmath47 , the plot of the differential number of scattered photons displays the transition from the thomson ( elastic scattering ) to the klein - nishina regime ( inelastic scattering ) that is displayed as a sharp break in figure [ fig_comp_dermer ] .",
    "the upper limit of the thomson regime depends on the initial energy in the observer s frame because depending on the incident angle of the external photons they loose or win energy due to the change of the frame of reference .",
    "the maximal electron energy @xmath48 that allows scattering in the thomson regime determines this upper limit : @xmath49 .",
    "hence , the maximal photon energy that results from thomson scattering is defined by the maximal electron energy , i.e. @xmath50 . the higher @xmath51 , the more the incident photon distribution is peaked , the higher the maximum energy @xmath52 and the lower @xmath48 and the thomson limit .      , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "emissions are presented in the observer frame assuming a spectral index of the electron distribution of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and an incident photon energy of @xmath59 .",
    "emissions are calculated in the observer frame and correspond to a viewing angle of @xmath60 if @xmath61.,width=415 ]    , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and an incident photon energy of @xmath59 .",
    "emissions are calculated in the observer frame and correspond to a viewing angle of @xmath60 if @xmath61.,width=415 ]    boosting the resulting spectrum into the observer s frame enhances the differential number of photons emerging at @xmath62 and decreases those emerging at @xmath63 .",
    "the main characteristics of the spectrum - in particular the break - remain . in figure [ fig_energies ] the development of the break",
    "is shown by choosing different maximal electron energies of @xmath64 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 . the higher the electron energy , the higher the maximal energy of the scattered photons . in the klein - nishina regime photons",
    "are scattered to energies up to @xmath65 while in the thomson regime up to @xmath66 .",
    "the break gradually appears as scattering is dominated by the klein - nishina regime .",
    "it turns out that this break is sharper than in @xcite . as we do not use any approximations ( e.g. head on approximation , outgoing photons",
    "are directed along the direction of the scattering electrons , i.e. @xmath67 ) when calculating the spectrum the sharper break is due to the angle averaged solution of @xcite ( introduced by @xcite ) . by taking the average of all emergent photon angles in the blob frame we studied how angle averaging effects the shape of the break ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig_comp_georg ] ) . the break becomes less sharp and is similar to the shape of the break in @xcite .",
    "the number of photons of the angle averaged solution is lower than those of the exact calculation due to the decreasing photon number at lower emerging angle @xmath68 .       if @xmath61 . the spectral index for the electron distribution runs @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath69.,width=415 ]    in the following section we compare our results to those of @xcite with respect to the regime of elastic scattering ( thomson regime ) .",
    "we observe the differential scattered photon number to be larger than predicted by @xcite ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig_comp_dermer ] ) .",
    "dermer considers only the emergent photons that are scattered to the maximal energy @xmath70 .",
    "this fact explains the observed difference since in our work all photons with energies ranging from the initial photon energy to the maximum energy @xmath71 are also considered .",
    "we obtain dermer s result if we only take into account the photons that are scattered to the maximum energy .",
    "the distribution of scattered photons in the observer s frame as well as the difference to dermer highly depends on the observing angle and the velocity of the blob .",
    "depending on the emergent angle @xmath24 and the gamma factor of the blob @xmath51 the relative difference @xmath72 of the differential number of scattered photons between our exact calculation and @xcite is shown in figure [ fig_valid_dermer ] as a contour plot .",
    "the mean value for all relative differences for @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 and hence the correcting factor runs @xmath75 .",
    "the limits for the gamma factor of the blob @xmath51 and the emergent angle @xmath24 can be deduced from the values in figure [ fig_valid_dermer ] .     of the differential number of scattered photons between this exact calculation and @xcite , dependent on the emergent angle @xmath21 and the gamma factor of the blob @xmath51 .",
    "the lines are contour lines and show together with the coulors the value of the relative difference.,width=453 ]    we find that for higher emergent angles @xmath76 and higher blob velocities @xmath77 our differential number of scattered photons is higher by a factor of @xmath0 than calculated in @xcite .",
    "hence , dermer s approximations can be used for high doppler factors and small observing angles , i.e. @xmath78 . but for higher observing angles and smaller doppler factors the deviation increases and the klein - nishina cross section and the exact incident photon distribution must be considered .",
    "considering the boost factor that is needed to transform the differential number of scattered photons from the blob frame into the observer s frame , we computed a lower boost factor than derived in @xcite .",
    "analogously to @xcite the boosting depends on the spectral index @xmath1 of the electron distribution .",
    "if @xmath79 and @xmath80 describe the exponents of the dopplerfactor of the respective quantities , the found boost factor goes as @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath79 coincidences with dermer s @xmath82 and @xmath80 reaches a smaller value .",
    "this difference can be explained by dermer s use of the head on approximation .",
    "dermer uses this approximation for all scattering processes but actually it is not valid for low energetic electrons .",
    "furthermore the number of low energetic electrons coincides with the decrease of the deviation when smaller spectral indices of the electron distribution are considered .      comparing our work",
    "to @xcite we did not use the head on approximation as well as the calculated scattered spectrum by @xcite that averages over all angles of the emergent photons . in @xcite",
    "the only angle dependent quantity is the doppler factor while we computed directly the angle dependent scattered spectrum . while the rough shape and peak energies coincidences with @xcite we find as already mentioned a smaller boost factor than @xcite and @xcite . due to the exact calculation",
    "the break in our spectrum is much sharper than in @xcite . but",
    "taking the average of all angles of the emergent photons softens the break and approaches the results of @xcite .    summing up , in contrast to @xcite we observe a higher differential number of scattered photons in the regime of elastic scattering .",
    "furthermore a lower boost factor was computed because we considered the exact distribution of the incident photon field . despite this difference",
    "dermer s approximation is applicable for high doppler factors and small observing angles .",
    "but for high inclination angles ( e.g. m87 , @xcite ) or small doppler factors ( e.g. bl lacertae 3c371.0 or rg 3c84 , @xcite ) the calculations of this work should be used .",
    "furthermore for high electronic spectral indices dermer s boost factor overvalues and a too large number of scattered photons is yielded .",
