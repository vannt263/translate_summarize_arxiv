    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is a nearby dwarf galaxy ( @xmath4 60 kpc ; * ? ? ? * ) which provides an ideal environment to study the interstellar medium ( ism ) in a region of low metallicity ( z @xmath4 0.005 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the foreground galactic extinction is low ( e(b - v ) = 0.02 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its face - on view orientation allows the observer to investigate the small scale structures .",
    "the smc , itself , contains significant amount of dust and gas but with a low dust - to - gas ratio ( 8 times smaller than the milky way ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a strong interstellar ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field ( 4  10 times higher than that in the solar neighborhood ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ism of the smc is similar to that of high redshift galaxies because of its low metallicity and therefore may be a stepping stone to our understanding of the ism in them @xcite .",
    "dust in the smc is quite different from that in either the milky way or the lmc as shown , for instance , by the absence of 2175   bump @xcite .",
    "models of the dust in the smc typically assume that it is dominated by silicates with the absence of the 2175   bump attributed to a lack of carbonaceous dust @xcite .    the surface brightness and",
    "integrated magnitudes of the bright regions of the smc has been mapped in the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) by a number of rocket and satellite observations @xcite . here , we present the first observations of diffuse far - uv ( fuv : 1000  1150  ) emission from the smc .",
    "these were serendipitous observations made with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ and include different environments in the smc : from those near hot stars to those further out in the edges of the galaxy .",
    "the diffuse emission tracks the interaction of the radiation field with the dust and is an important input into models of distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "the smc offers an opportunity to test these models at high spatial resolution and to distinguish the different components of the galaxy .",
    "we have used observations made by the _ fuse _ spacecraft to measure the diffuse emission from the smc in the fuv .",
    "the _ fuse _ instrument and its mission have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it consisted of four optical channels with each channel comprising a mirror , focal plane assembly ( fpa ) and diffraction grating .",
    "two of the channels included optics coated with lif and aluminum and the other two with sic and each channel was imaged onto a delay - line detector at the focal plane .",
    "observations were made through three different apertures : the high - resolution aperture ( hirs : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 ) ; the medium - resolution aperture ( mdrs : @xmath8 @xmath6 @xmath7 ) ; and the low - resolution aperture ( lwrs : @xmath9 @xmath6 @xmath9 ) , with all three obtaining data simultaneously .",
    "thus even though a source may have been observed in the mdrs or hirs aperture , the diffuse background could still be measured through the lwrs aperture as it is separated from the former apertures by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "only the very brightest backgrounds could be observed with the smaller mdrs aperture or with the less sensitive sic channels . @xcite",
    "have shown that the practical limit for _ fuse _ diffuse observation is about 2000 photons @xmath0 s@xmath1 sr@xmath1 @xmath1 .",
    "there were a total of 220 _ fuse _ observations within @xmath12 of the smc but 190 were of stars through the lwrs aperture leaving 30 pointings from which we could extract the diffuse background .",
    "these observations were from two classes of targets : stars observed through either of the mdrs or hirs apertures ; or empty areas of the sky where the spectrographs were allowed to thermalize before an instrumental realignment .",
    "the observational details of these targets are given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "most of the regions observed are either active areas of star formation or h ii regions , such as ngc 346 and ngc 330 .",
    "the data selection and analysis procedure have been explained in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we began with the raw photon list and processed the data through the latest version of calfuse ( v3.2 ; * ? ? ? * ) except that we estimated the instrumental background from the counts in the detector just off the spectrum .",
    "the background was subtracted from the data which was then collapsed into two wavelength bands per segment , avoiding airglow lines .",
    "this resulted in a total of six bands from three segments .",
    "we found that the data were of much higher quality from segment 1 leaving us with four bands at effective wavelengths of 1004   ( 1a1 ) , 1058   ( 1a2 ) , 1117   ( 1b1 ) , 1157   ( 1b2 ) .    the surface brightness measured in the _ fuse _",
    "bands show a strong correlation between each other with correlation coefficients of better than 0.9 .",
    "our observed surface brightnesses ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) range from near the _ fuse _ detection limit to as high as @xmath2 photons @xmath0 s@xmath1 sr@xmath1 @xmath1 in ngc 346 , the youngest and largest h ii region in the smc .",
    "we have estimated the level of galactic background at these wavelengths from the _ voyager _ maps of @xcite to be about 1000 photons @xmath0 s@xmath1 sr@xmath1 @xmath1 , much less than the observed smc fluxes .",
    "we have plotted the location of our targets ( plus symbols ) on a 160 @xmath13 m image of the smc @xcite in figure [ fig1 ] . also shown",
    "are the @xmath14 fields ( circles ) observed by _ ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) _ at 1615  , covering most of the smc bar @xcite .",
    "we calculated the diffuse nuv flux for the 9 _ fuse _ locations that are within the _ uit _ field of observations by integrating the @xmath15 _ uit _ pixels over the @xmath9 @xmath6 @xmath9 _ fuse _ lwrs aperture .",
    "these fluxes are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the _ uit _ fluxes are highly correlated with the surface brightness of the _ fuse _ bands with a correlation coefficient of better than 0.88 ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the fraction of the total ( stellar + diffuse ) fuv light emitted as diffuse radiation in the smc provides important information in context to the regional distribution of dust .",
    "we found the total flux in each of the _ uit _ fields by summing the fluxes in all pixels in that field .",
    "we then used the catalog of @xcite to calculate the total stellar flux in each field . the diffuse flux in the _ uit _ field was the difference between the two .",
    "we extended the stellar flux into the _ fuse _ bands using kurucz @xcite model spectra and calculated their flux in _ fuse _ bands .",
    "finally , we extrapolated the diffuse flux into the _ fuse _ bands using the observed _ fuse / uit _ diffuse flux ratios i.e. , the slope of the best fit line ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , obtained separately for each of the _ fuse _ bands from their correlation with _",
    "uit _ band .",
    "@xcite predicted that 22% of the diffuse flux was due to faint unresolved stars which we subtracted from each of the _ uit _ and _ fuse _ diffuse fluxes . the diffuse fraction defined as the diffuse emission divided by the total emission",
    "was then calculated for each region and over the entire smc bar ( figure [ fig3 ] ) , with an estimated uncertainty of about 30% . in all cases ,",
    "the behavior of the diffuse fraction is almost the same , rising by 10% from 1000   to 1150   and a further 50% from 1150   to 1615  .",
    "the albedo of the dust obtained from the theoretical predictions of @xcite for a mix of spherical carbonaceous and silicate grains increases by about the same factor over the considered wavelength range and the consequent increase in scattered light may be responsible for the increased diffuse fraction at longer wavelengths .",
    "integrating over the entire smc bar , we find that 34% of the total radiation that escapes the smc bar at 1004   is diffuse rising to 63% at 1615  .",
    "the scattered light in the smc has been modeled by @xcite using multiple scattering in a clumpy medium .",
    "they found that the diffuse radiation is 25% to 50% of the total ( figure [ fig3 ] ) depending on different dust geometries . considering only h ii regions of the smc",
    ", we found that around 20% of the total radiation at 1004  is diffuse rising to 50% at 1615  .",
    "studies for the orion nebula @xcite and ngc 595 @xcite find similar results with 66% of the total radiation being diffuse at 1400   in orion and 55% at 1700   in ngc 595 .",
    "@xcite found significantly smaller values for the diffuse fraction in the lmc ( figure [ fig4 ] ) perhaps due to the difference in grain size and composition between the two galaxies @xcite .",
    "the albedo of the smc dust is about 50% higher @xcite compared to the lmc dust ( figure [ fig4 ] ) and this may explain the increased diffuse fraction in the smc .",
    "we have examined the variation of the diffuse fraction over different region in the smc bar finding that it is larger in those areas where there are fewer stars ( ngc 267 and ngc 292 ) suggesting that much of the diffuse radiation from those regions is actually due to distant stars .",
    "similar results were found in the lmc @xcite which show that the diffuse fraction is less in crowded regions such as 30 doradus , sn 1987a and n11 ( 4%  10% ) and more in sparse regions such as n70 ( 24%  45% ) . @xcite modeled the escape fraction of nuv photons for the lmc where they show that much of the stellar light is non - local i.e. , the light from the distant ob associations is scattered by local dust .",
    "a catalog of h ii regions in the smc was given by @xcite and their integrated h@xmath3 flux was calculated by @xcite .",
    "we have computed the integrated fuv diffuse flux in the _ fuse _ bands for 36 h ii regions defined by @xcite .",
    "we find a good correlation ( r = 0.81 ) between the integrated diffuse fuv emission and h@xmath3 emission from h ii regions of the smc ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is as expected given that the h@xmath3 flux is proportional to the brightness of the exciting stars as is fuv flux .",
    "we have measured fuv diffuse emissions in the smc using the spectra obtained by _ fuse _ from different environments .",
    "the diffuse radiation is primarily due to light from hot stars scattered by the interstellar dust grains .",
    "we have used these observations to measure the fuv diffuse fraction which is 34%  44% in the _ fuse _ bands ( 1000  1150  ) increasing upto 63% at 1615  .",
    "the amount of light scattered increases towards the longer wavelengths showing that a large percent of the light at shorter wavelengths is absorbed by the dust .",
    "the behavior and distribution of fuv diffuse emission and emission fraction are quite similar in both the lmc and the smc with much of the stellar radiation in both galaxies being non - local i.e. , the diffuse ( scattered ) light in a particular region is the light coming from distant stars being scattered by local dust .",
    "the diffuse fraction in the smc is higher than the lmc and the difference in diffuse fraction is related to amount of dust , dust grain properties , and geometry .",
    "a more detailed model incorporating the ample amount of data available for both galaxies in other spectral band is in progress to sort out the effect of local geometry from dust scattering .",
    "we found a good correlation between fuv diffuse emission and the h@xmath3 emission in the h ii regions .",
