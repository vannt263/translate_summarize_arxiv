    "looking out at the universe from the vantage point of earth , we see a small fluctuation @xmath0 in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) . over the last decade , advances in observational astronomy have allowed us to commence a detailed study of @xmath0 s statistical properties .",
    "we aim to compare these properties with those of small fluctuations which , according to our present ideas , are expected to have existed in the very early universe .",
    "these fluctuations evolve in a hot , dense plasma of tightly coupled baryons and photons .",
    "if we suppose the plasma era was preceded by an epoch of primordial inflation , then initial conditions for these fluctuations can be calculated from the parameters of the inflationary model . the variance predicted by this approach",
    "was computed in a now - classic series of early papers @xcite , and later extended to the skewness @xcite and kurtosis @xcite . with sufficiently precise experimental data in hand",
    ", we can work backwards from observations of these statistical properties to determine what the initial conditions must have been .",
    "the result is a realistic prospect of constraining parameters in certain inflationary models .",
    "this ambitious programme was begun in earnest following the arrival of high - quality cmb maps made by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "even more precise data are expected from the _ planck surveyor _ satellite .",
    "once it had become clear that the statistical properties of @xmath0 carried important information about whatever physics was operative during inflation , theorists were soon tempted to refine their calculations in the hope that additional detail could be extracted .",
    "a similar programme in electroweak physics had provided important clues about the unknown details of electroweak symmetry breaking , and it was reasonable to explore the possibility of similar gains in cosmology .",
    "the observable statistical properties of the inflationary density perturbation are encoded in its @xmath1-point correlation functions , with the leading contribution to each function typically suppressed by @xmath2 powers of the small quantity @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the hubble rate during inflation and @xmath5 is the planck mass .",
    "two types of refinement were possible : either to calculate to lowest order in @xmath3 at progressively larger @xmath1 , or to calculate higher order corrections with @xmath1 fixed .",
    "it had been known for a long time that perturbation theory beyond leading order in @xmath3 was complicated by troublesome infrared behaviour .",
    "sasaki , suzuki , yamamoto & yokoyama considered a @xmath6 theory with @xmath7 , coupled non - minimally to gravity , and evaluated each @xmath1-point function perturbatively @xcite .",
    "noticed that the @xmath1-point functions evaluated in de sitter space had a potential divergence in the far future , which they called `` superexpansionary . ''",
    "we will rephrase the analysis of sasaki _ et al . _ in modern notation and discuss the meaning of these divergences in  [ sec : zoo - time ] and  [ sec : time ] .",
    "later , mukhanov , abramo & brandenberger studied a different sort of infrared effect the accumulation of long wavelength fluctuations in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "( see also abramo & woodard , ref .",
    "this differed from the analysis of sasaki _ et al .",
    "_ , which had been based on a purely geometrical effect .",
    "whether such divergences are physical is complicated by the question of gauge , initially studied by unruh @xcite .",
    "later , losic & unruh were able to give a gauge - invariant argument that infrared terms generically become large in spacetimes close to de sitter @xcite",
    ". we will discuss corrections of this type in  [ sec : zoo - box ] and  [ sec : space ] .",
    "divergences of a third kind had long been studied by prokopec , tsamis , woodard and their collaborators .",
    "these authors took the quantum nature of correlation functions seriously , and calculated loop corrections just as one would when studying scattering experiments .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of both the rules for calculating these loops and the computations themselves are somewhat greater than in minkowski space .",
    "these calculations have been reported in a large literature .",
    "together with quantum effects studied by others , including boyanovsky , de vega & sanchez , a recent sample can be found in refs .",
    "we will consider effects of this type in  [ sec : zoo - new ] .",
    "perturbative calculations of correlation functions from inflation had been studied in the 1980s by allen , grinstein & wise @xcite and later by falk , rangarajan & srednicki @xcite .",
    "the sophistication of such calculations increased dramatically in the years following maldacena s calculation of the three - point function in single - field slow - roll inflation @xcite . at least in part , this increase was a consequence of the more complicated models of inflation which had been developed during the 1990s and early 2000s , and which theorists hoped would yield a distinctive pattern of correlations @xcite .",
    "these developments are reviewed pedagogically in a recent article by chen @xcite .    since 2002 ,",
    "significant theoretical effort has been expended in refining our understanding of both inflationary correlation functions themselves , and the models which can generate significantly non - gaussian statistics .",
    "the calculations reviewed in this paper were a consequence of the reinvigoration of interest in infrared issues which followed this effort .",
    "logarithms exhibiting secular growth with time were discovered in calculations of @xmath1-point correlation functions with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "other calculations , if taken at face value , gave divergent answers in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "divergences could be avoided by carrying out the calculation in a finite box , but any such procedure left behind residual logarithms involving the box cutoff @xcite .",
    "further logarithms were encountered while studying the influence of unknown physics at energy scales even larger than the inflationary scale @xcite .",
    "infrared effects are not a phenomenon unique to de sitter calculations , but are present in many applications of quantum field theory .",
    "their appearance typically signals the presence of a non - trivial background , which can not be described by asymptotic _ in_- and _ out_-states containing a definite number of particles . in scattering calculations ,",
    "infrared divergences allow putative fixed - particle states to develop a slowly varying field , made out of an accumulation of arbitrarily many soft particles radiated on approach to or recoil from the scattering event .",
    "this `` bloch  nordsieck '' or `` initial state radiation '' phenomenon is studied in many textbooks on quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "a similar effect can occur in the confined phase of quantum chromodynamics , where soft particles can be radiated by partons moving inside nuclei .",
    "these particles are trapped by the strong qcd force , and change the background colour field .",
    "this effect may dramatically alter the mix of partons observed by an impinging probe such as a photon , and can not be neglected in an accurate comparison with experiment @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath8 approximation is a related example , in which the same infrared effects control the @xmath9 content of colliding nuclei .",
    "the results are very practical .",
    "for example , this method can be used to predict the rate of higgs production from @xmath10 fusion @xcite .    throughout this article , planck s constant @xmath11 and the speed of light @xmath12",
    "are set to unity .",
    "many expressions are written in terms of the reduced planck mass , @xmath13 .",
    "for brevity , a scalar field which contributes to the energy ",
    "momentum tensor @xmath14 is referred to as ` active , ' whereas a field making no contribution to @xmath14 is referred to as a ` spectator . ' in a cosmological context , such scalars are isocurvature modes .",
    "in this section , i briefly review the sources of logarithmic divergences in inflationary correlation functions .      a decade",
    "after calculations of the 2-point function had determined the variance in @xmath0 expected from an inflationary initial condition , the corresponding skewness was calculated by falk , rangarajan & srednicki @xcite in an approximation where gravitational interactions were neglected . at that time",
    ", data from the cobe satellite @xcite had established the existence of temperature fluctuations in the microwave background at the level @xmath15 , where @xmath16 was the average microwave temperature over the sky . in inflationary models @xmath17",
    "is closely related to the parameter @xmath3 . since the skewness is proportional to @xmath18 , it was already evident that any non - gaussianity would be very small .",
    "let us suppose inflation is driven by a single scalar field with potential @xmath19 .",
    "we define the slow - roll parameters by @xmath20 and use a conformal time variable , @xmath21 , related to cosmic time @xmath22 by @xmath23 . when measured in this variable",
    ", horizon crossing occurs for a mode of wavelength @xmath24 when @xmath25 , and after @xmath26 e - folds outside the horizon we have @xmath27 .",
    "the infinite future of de sitter space corresponds to @xmath28 . in this notation",
    "the result of falk , rangarajan & srednicki can be written @xmath29 where a subscript ` @xmath30 ' denotes evaluation at the time @xmath31 , and ` @xmath32 ' denotes terms of lower order in the slow - roll expansion , together with other terms which do not grow as @xmath33 @xcite . , which is conserved on superhorizon scales , @xmath34 , in the absence of entropy modes .",
    "occasionally it has been argued that an estimate of the non - gaussian yield at the end of inflation can be obtained by setting @xmath35 , but this example shows clearly that unless care is taken to account for possible cancellations any such procedure can be quite misleading .",
    "the possibility of such cancellations when reasoning with cutoff - dependent terms in a general effective field theory was pointed out by burgess & london @xcite . in the inflationary context",
    ", the pitfalls of this procedure were noted in ref .",
    "i would like to thank xingang chen for discussions on this point . ]",
    "higher powers of @xmath36 may be generated at higher order in the slow - roll expansion , either by retaining such terms explicitly in the tree - level calculation or by including loop corrections , as we shall shortly explain .",
    "a similar effect can be observed in the massless limit of the calculation by chen & wang @xcite .",
    "the result is a power series in @xmath36 with an apparent divergence in the limit @xmath37 , as sasaki _",
    "et al . _ had predicted @xcite .",
    "series representations of this type were later applied to inflationary correlation functions by gong & stewart @xcite , who obtained them by systematically solving mukhanov s equation @xcite using a green s function approach .",
    "gong & stewart remarked that the correction linear in logarithms was typically proportional to @xmath38 , whereas the correction quadratic in logarithms was typically proportional to @xmath39 , and so on .",
    "always orders itself in this form , and according to a general theorem due to weinberg ( to be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : weinberg ] ) there may be cases where it does not .",
    "in many practical examples where the slow - roll approximation applies , however , this structure appears . in these expressions , the symbol ` @xmath40 ' is used to mean that the coefficient of @xmath41 is a quantity of order @xmath42 ( but not necessarily @xmath42 itself ) , wheras the coefficient of @xmath43 is of order @xmath44 , and so on .",
    "] one could therefore expect the series to break down as a predictive instrument when @xmath45 .",
    "this occurs when the mode @xmath24 is of order @xmath46 e - folds outside the horizon .",
    "taking into account the construction of gong & stewart , and bearing in mind that @xmath31 is the time at which we wish to evaluate the correlation functions , it seems clear that there is nothing mysterious about the appearance of powers of @xmath36 .",
    "such terms merely express that correlations evolve outside the horizon .",
    "this evolution is mainly driven by the evolving classical background field @xcite , but we shall see in  [ sec : dynamical ] that intrinsically quantum contributions can also be present . we conclude that , as in other applications of quantum field theory , properties of the background play a role in interpreting the physics of infrared divergences . in the present case ,",
    "correlation functions can be evaluated at any time of interest provided the series of logarithms can be summed or ignored .",
    "therefore , for observational purposes the key question is the value of @xmath42 when modes of interest leave the horizon . we would typically wish to evaluate correlation functions at the end of inflation , where initial conditions for the subsequent evolution must be set . if @xmath47 , the end of inflation may be uncomfortably close to the era when @xmath48 .",
    "we will return to this question in  [ sec : time ] , where we will argue that a reasonable prescription exists for handling time - dependent logarithms which does not impair our ability to extract a predictive initial condition even if @xmath49 at the time of interest .",
    "we can already note one obvious strategy .",
    "if only logarithmic divergences are present , then better control over the power series may be achieved by `` resumming'' that is , accounting for the contribution of all terms at the same order as the _ leading logarithms _ , which are terms of the form @xmath50 for all @xmath51 @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the principal tool is the renormalization group equation .",
    "such an analysis has been carried out by burgess , holman , leblond & shandera @xcite , whose method will be outlined in  [ sec : time ] .",
    "unfortunately , this method leaves open the question of whether all divergences in the @xmath33 limit are comparatively tame logarithms , or if more aggressive behaviour can occur .",
    "this question was taken up by weinberg in 2005 @xcite , and later by chaicherdsakul @xcite .",
    "weinberg was able to prove that in many inflationary models , but not all , the worst divergences would be logarithmic .",
    "in a later publication , this theorem was extended to fields of higher spin @xcite .",
    "what of the possibility of faster divergences , which are apparently allowed by the analysis of sasaki _ et al . _",
    "these would grow like powers of the scale factor , @xmath52 , corresponding to powers rather than logarithms of @xmath53 .",
    "in many cases such aggressive growth would induce a failure of predictivity long before the end of inflation . also , whereas the coefficient which accompanies a logarithmic divergence is physically meaningful , and can be used as an input to renormalization group calculations , power - law divergences are by contrast mostly meaningless .",
    "the late - time physics whose presence they signal must be found elsewhere : it can not usually be distilled from the properties of the divergences themselves .",
    "although weinberg s theorem identifies a class of models containing interactions which may give rise to such fast divergences , it does not appear that any previously proposed inflationary model makes essential use of such interactions .",
    "for this reason they have not yet received much attention .      until non - linear questions became pressing ,",
    "inflationary perturbation theory was dominated by the traditional lifshitz approach @xcite , in which one separates each field into a background @xmath54 and perturbation @xmath55 . at second order and above such calculations",
    "become more arduous , although they have now been carried to an impressive degree of refinement @xcite .",
    "the separate universe principle is an alternative to the lifshitz approach . according to this principle",
    ", a volume of spacetime containing a background field @xmath54 and perturbation @xmath55 behaves ( on scales sufficiently large that gradients may be neglected ) just like an unperturbed universe containing the homogeneous field value @xmath56 .",
    "if we solve for an arbitrary quantity @xmath57 with initial conditions set by the value of a background field at time @xmath31 in the unperturbed universe , we can determine the values taken by this quantity on superhorizon scales in the perturbed universe using the trivial identity @xmath58 where @xmath21 is the time at which we wish to evaluate @xmath59 .",
    "this might typically be at the end of inflation or later .",
    "whatever time we choose ,",
    ".   allows correlations of @xmath59 to be computed provided we know the correlation functions of @xmath60 at time @xmath31 . for example , the first contribution to the two - point function of @xmath59 is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes the partial derivative of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "higher - order terms present in eq .",
    "imply that other contributions must exist .",
    "let us restore spatial arguments for clarity .",
    "even if @xmath64 has gaussian statistics at time @xmath31 , there will be contributions of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the preceding term with @xmath67 and @xmath68 exchanged and the symbol `` @xmath69 '' means that the correlation function contains this contribution among others .",
    "indeed , these four - point correlations will be accompanied by six- , eight- and higher @xmath70-point correlation functions for all @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath64 has non - gaussian statistics then even more contributions will be generated .",
    "zaballa , rodrguez & lyth introduced a set of diagrammatic ( `` feynman - like '' ) rules designed to keep track of these terms @xcite .",
    "generalized rules were discussed by byrnes , koyama , sasaki & wands @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , but practical calculations are rarely of sufficient complexity to require them .",
    "these contributions depend on the correlations among @xmath64 when @xmath71 becomes large , which are identified most simply in fourier space .",
    "we find that @xmath72 receives contributions of the form @xmath73 in which @xmath74 is the power spectrum of @xmath64 , defined by @xmath75 in the limit @xmath76 , significant contributions to the @xmath77-integral in eq .",
    "arise only from the region @xmath78 .",
    "the behaviour of the integrand in the small-@xmath24 limit depends crucially on @xmath74 . for a scale - invariant power spectrum generated during inflation @xmath79 , which gives logarithmic singularities in the @xmath80-integral .",
    "boubekeur & lyth @xcite , and later lyth & rodrguez @xcite , remarked that because the logarithmic behaviour is softened in the limit @xmath81 , the log - divergent part only receives contributions for @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , to a reasonable approximation , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an infrared cutoff .",
    "this expression diverges in the limit @xmath85 .",
    "it is clear at once that this divergence is not a physical prediction .",
    "it depends on what is assumed about correlations among the perturbations in the infinite volume limit , where @xmath86 . even within the framework we are using , it is easy to see that if @xmath74 has constant red tilt then this logarithmic divergence is exchanged for a power law . if @xmath74 has constant blue tilt the integral is convergent .",
    "an exactly logarithmic divergence occurs only for a scale invariant @xmath74 .",
    "for example , if @xmath55 has even a very small mass this will give rise to a finite correlation length , beyond which correlations decay exponentially . the divergence in eq .",
    "would then be absent .",
    "we will see later that there are good physical reasons to believe this is what should happen in practice , at least in certain theories , and some evidence from concrete calculations that it does .",
    "in any case we should also recognize that the framework we have been discussing is inadequate for the description of correlations on very large scales .",
    "why is this ? to calculate the power spectrum from a model of inflation",
    "we must typically assume that the background field @xmath54 is spatially homogeneous and depends only on time , whereas the spatially dependent fluctuation @xmath60 satisfies @xmath87 everywhere .",
    "although this is reasonable on scales not too much larger than the de sitter horizon , it need not happen that every field admits such a decomposition as we pass to the infinite volume limit . if this is the case we should set the scale @xmath88 to be conservatively smaller than the largest scale for which a spatially homogeneous background @xmath54 can be found .",
    "the calculation makes sense within this `` box . ''",
    "if we are forced to discuss correlations on larger scales , they will have to be determined by patching together a mosaic of boxes in which the homogeneous background field may take different values .",
    "this point of view was advocated by boubekeur & lyth @xcite , and later refined by byrnes , koyama , sasaki & wands @xcite , lyth @xcite and other authors @xcite .",
    "this can not be the whole story , because eq .   shows that the mosaicking procedure leaves behind terms involving @xmath89 .",
    "these logarithms depend on the arbitrary scale @xmath88 . assuming the physics of the scalar field zero - mode to be quasi - classical on very large scales , the missing element is an accurate map of the average scalar field value within each box of the mosaic .",
    "this map naturally depends on the scale @xmath88 , but the @xmath88 dependence of physical quantities cancels when we study correlations within the mosaic as a whole .",
    "these issues will be discussed in more detail in  [ sec : space ] .",
    "we see again that the appearance of infrared divergences is connected with the existence of non - trivial background configurations . in the present case",
    "the map could consist of an inventory of boxes , pairing each box with the average field value within .",
    "alternatively , in a theory such as inflation where predictions are essentially statistical , it could simply consist of a probability distribution for the average field value , taken over the ensemble of boxes .      in the previous two sections we have emphasized the role of the background field configuration in generating infrared divergences : when determining correlations among small fluctuations we take the background to be homogeneous and approximately time independent . in practice it may be neither , leading to the emergence of compensating logarithms .",
    "there is another source of logarithmic corrections which is unconnected with the background field configuration .",
    "suppose we define some quantum field theory at a scale @xmath90 . in using this field theory to compute correlations in vacuum where there is no background at all we are familiar with the appearance of `` large logarithms '' of the form @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is an energy scale characteristic of the correlation in question .",
    "corrections of this sort occur in any quantum field theory , and the field theories we use to compute inflationary correlations are no exception .",
    "such logarithms were studied by weinberg @xcite , who computed the correction induced by loops of @xmath26 different spectator fields in a model where inflation is driven by the vacuum energy associated with a single scalar field .",

    "the result is to reproduce the conclusion that infrared divergences derive from a supposition that calculations are to be carried out with a definite , homogeneous expectation value for the background field configuration . from this point of view , eq .   can be thought of as an analogue of cluster decomposition in de sitter .",
    "these ideas have a large literature of their own .",
    "kirsten & garriga @xcite used related reasoning to represent the quantized massless scalar field as the product of a hilbert space , associated with the zero - mode , and a fock space corresponding to excitations of finite wavenumber .",

    "however , this argument does not entirely preclude the appearance of @xmath24 in any logarithm .",
    "for example , the combination @xmath36 measures by how many e - folds the wavenumber @xmath24 is outside the horizon at time @xmath31 and is a sensible physical quantity .",
    "nevertheless , this example shows that one must be careful in dealing with the combination @xmath89 , in which @xmath88 is also a comoving scale .",
    "let us first idealize to an inflating volume which is spatially infinite .",
    "as in  [ sec : zoo - box ] we divide this volume into boxes of size @xmath88 , in each of which the field is spatially homogeneous with small perturbations .",
    "we have seen that correlations computed within these boxes depend on the arbitrary scale @xmath88 , but ( assuming only zero - modes need be retained from the long wavelength physics ) an answer independent of @xmath88 is obtained if we average the correlations over boxes @xcite .",
    "this requires a knowledge of the homogeneous background field within each box of the mosaic .",
    "if merely probabilistic answers are acceptable , it may only be necessary to use information about the statistical distribution of field values over the ensemble of boxes .",
    "cosmological perturbation theory has been discussed from this point of view by many authors ; see , for example , the recent textbook by mukhanov @xcite .",
    "if we assume that only zero - modes need be retained , as in ",
    "[ sec : mosaic ] , it follows that this argument does not depend on a careful discussion of how the total @xmath88 dependence can somehow cancel between the @xmath88-dependent box - sized correlations and the distribution of field values among boxes . the schematic argument of eqs .",
    " shows that in a full treatment , where the entire ultraviolet physics and initial conditions are known , we have done nothing more than divide the calculation into two parts .",
    "when we assemble these two halves , the final answer must be independent of @xmath88 .",
    "this happens automatically , no matter how remarkably fine - tuned the necessary cancellations appear , and is a standard argument in the application of effective field theories @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath88 therefore disappears from the answer and we need not worry about its physical significance . in practice , the distribution of field values among boxes of the mosaic will evolve in time .",
    "after convolving with this distribution , @xmath88-dependent terms would be traded for a time dependence which could itself be represented by secular logarithms",
    ".    however , it may not be the case that this @xmath88-independent answer is the quantity we wish to compare with observation . in discussing similar questions almost twenty years ago",

    "whichever is correct , the answer will not change the result of satellite observations made today .    if we subscribe to programme outlined in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , then we must suppose that our observable region of the universe passed through a phase of inflation which eventually came to an end .",
    "we assume that the classical background associated with whatever scalar fields supplied the necessary vacuum energy became roughly homogeneous within a box somewhat larger than our present horizon .",
    "this box should be large enough to contain many regions of comparable size to the presently observable universe , but need not be exponentially larger @xcite .",
    "we wish to compute correlations in the density fluctuation which would be recorded by a typical observer whose local patch experienced the same gross cosmological history . for this reason it may be _ incorrect _ to compare the @xmath88-independent answer discussed above with experiment , because in this answer",

    "the problem we face in this scenario is to determine the correct homogeneous background in which we should carry out our calculation . in general the answer depends on the distribution of field values within the ensemble of boxes , but there is a simple class of models in which this question is trivial . in any single - field model with a unique reheating minimum there is a unique value of the background field , @xmath248 , when inflation is of order 60 e - folds from ending .",
    "the prior history of the large - scale universe is irrelevant @xcite . to compute what would be recorded by a typical observer in this model , we are entitled to carry out our calculation within a box carrying an approximately homogeneous background field with value @xmath249 . in this picture , the effective field theories we use to study slow - roll inflation are to be understood only as a description of the process by which an inflationary trajectory arrives in its final reheating minimum , causing inflation to end",

    "the argument of boubekeur & lyth @xcite , which was extended to two loops by bartolo _",

    "there is no preferred background configuration analogous to the single - field configuration @xmath249 in which we should carry out our computations .",
    "even where a terminal vacuum can be selected in advance , it was shown by byrnes , choi & hall that the final fluctuations may depend sensitively on the path by which the fields arrive at the minimum @xcite ( reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to determine what would be recorded by a typical observer we must know at least the frequency with which these minima are populated by boxes in which inflation terminates .",
    "this can be ascertained only if we know the distribution of field values within boxes of the mosaic , and ( as we have discussed above ) this distribution is an ultraviolet - dependent quantity . without knowledge of the complete ultraviolet physics , including any relevant initial conditions",

    "apart from our interest in observational predictions , there may be other reasons to enquire about the large - scale disposition of the scalar fields .",
    "senatore & zaldarriaga @xcite emphasized that we would like to know the circumstances under which eternal inflation can occur @xcite .",
    "it is possible this depends on effects arising from loops at high order in perturbation theory .",
    "for this reason we may wish to go beyond the narrow view advanced above , according to which our theories of slow - roll inflation should be restricted to a description of how inflation ends .",
    "using a model of slow - roll inflation to describe evolution within a large spatial volume over very long times would again require us to know the distribution of field values over the entire mosaic of boxes .",
    "clearly we can not hope to calculate this distribution _",
    "ab initio_. suppose , however , that by some means we know the distribution of field values over the mosaic of boxes at time @xmath252 , at which point we suppose the hubble scale took the value @xmath253 .",

    ", it is the regime of small @xmath254 which is accessible to perturbative calculations .",

    "our discussion of time evolution in   [ sec : zoo - time ] and   [ sec : time ] shows that we will obtain reasonable answers only if we account for the slow roll - down of this field . in a single - field scenario",
    "the evolution of the background field value is given by @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the potential and @xmath257 is a gaussian noise term satisfying @xmath258 in a careful treatment , we would find that this noise term depends on what we assume about the physics responsible for generating correlations within this box .",
    ".   is a langevin equation , which can be equivalently expressed as an evoution equation for the distribution function of field values over the mosaic , @xmath259 , @xmath260 various refinements of this equation are possible , which were discussed by salopek & bond @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that stochastic inflation may represent one possible method of determining the distribution of field values over the entire mosaic of boxes @xcite .",
    "although this idea is attractive , there are several drawbacks .",

    "this difficulty is usually circumvented by seeking stationary solutions of the fokker ",
    "planck equation , eq .  .",
    "however , it is not clear under which circumstances this is a reasonable choice , or whether the result genuinely approximates what would be obtained if we were to retain the complete ultraviolet physics .",
    "second , the evolution equations   and   depend on what we assume about physics at high values of the hubble parameter , up to @xmath261 . in particular , these equations assume that slow - roll inflation is a good description throughout this regime .",
    "this is analogous to the supposition that the standard model is a good description of physics at energies from the electroweak frontier at @xmath262 to up the gut scale at @xmath263 .",
    "this assumption allows renormalization group evolution of the su(2 ) , u(1)@xmath264 and strong coupling constants to predict a unification near the gut scale in the same way that eq .",
    "allows us to predict the behaviour of @xmath54 at values of @xmath4 far above those which gave rise to observable density fluctuations . in either case",
    "it is perfectly reasonable that unguessed physics intervenes to spoil the conclusion .",
    "if so , the true evolution of the background fields might follow laws very different to eqs .   and  .",
    "alternatively , at sufficiently high values of @xmath4 the concept of a homogeneous background field itself may lose meaning . in that case the present discussion would be invalidated , becoming relevant only at lower energies .",
    "it was emphasized above that , assuming only zero modes need be retained from the quasi - classical physics on large scales , cancellation of @xmath88 was automatic after averaging over the distribution of field values within the mosaic .",
    "since there is no recipe to construct this distribution , it must checked individually for each candidate .",
    "unfortunately , it is non - trivial to verify that the @xmath88-dependence carried by a solution to eq .   would precisely cancel that @xmath88-dependence of correlations computed within a box @xmath88 . at the time of writing",
    ", this does not appear to have been verified .",
    "a complete cancellation would depend on retaining sufficient information about the relevant long - range physics in eqs .",
    " , and it is far from obvious that this is the case .",
    "however , since the same physics which gives rise to the box - cutoff logarithms is used to compute the evolution of @xmath54 in eq .  , it is at least plausible that the @xmath88 dependence of @xmath265 may have the requisite properties .",
    "a similar property is exhibited by the parton distribution functions which describe the physics internal to colliding nuclei @xcite . a first step in this direction",
    "was given by kuhnel & schwarz @xcite who argued that large - scale correlations were strongly suppressed by stochastic effects , leading to infrared finite correlation functions .",
    "in  [ sec : zoo - time ] and  [ sec : time ] we discussed the role of an evolving background field in suppressing correlations at late times , and in  [ sec : dynamical ] we reviewed the argument of burgess _",
    "@xcite , according to which the secular logarithms could be resummed into a dynamically generated mass .",

    "a fluctuation @xmath266 in eq .   can push the field up the potential . at later times",

    "if an exact shift symmetry protects the potential of some field , then it experiences no classical evolution .",
    "an example might be a goldstone boson or axion , or more generally any isocurvature field which can be interpreted as an angle .",
    "once perturbations have been generated in such a field , they do not decay . in this case",
    "we would not expect resummation to generate a mass , and there is no prediction for the value taken by such a field within our presently observable patch , although it may be possible to estimate a distribution @xcite .",
    "hertzberg , tegmark & wilczek @xcite argued that such scenarios represented a test case of anthropic reasoning .    what would happen if a microwave background observable depended on the value of such a field ?",
    "we would not be able to predict which measurements should be recorded by cmb survey satellites , such as the wmap and planck satellite missions . a similar argument was given by sloth , who pointed out that an observable such as the tensor fraction , @xmath281 , may depend on a ratio of two quantities which receive loop corrections scaling differently as the box size increases @xcite .",
    "the expected value of @xmath281 will depend on the box in which correlations are computed .",
    "however , as has been stressed throughout , to obtain observables one must compute a conditional expectation value , contingent on inflation ending in our own vacuum ( almost surely ) everywhere within the box .",
    "for this reason , the observational relevance of infrared corrections in @xmath281 is not yet clear .",
    "infrared effects have attracted considerable interest , but at the time of writing it has not been possible to extract a definitive prediction of a novel effect from these calculations  that is , an effect which is not already implicit in calculations carried out locally around background fields set at a point on the scalar potential .",
    "the best studied examples of infrared effects are the time - dependent secular logarithms introduced in  [ sec : zoo - time ] . over short timescales",
    "these logarithms represent evolution of correlations , as the background fields slowly roll down their potentials . at later times quantum effects can become important , but their role remains somewhat unclear .",
    "the calculation of burgess _",
    "et al . _ , supported by the arguments of senatore & zaldarriaga , suggests that in stable theories they will suppress correlations at late times .",
    "box - cutoff logarithms represent a different problem : the possibility that , after many e - folds of inflation , spatial gradients develop in the background scalar fields .",
    "if we only wish to use our theories of inflation to study observable correlations generated on approach to reheating , then this may not be a significant problem .",
    "on the other hand , if we wish to study the evolution of a large spatial volume undergoing inflation for a long period of time , we expose ourselves to the possibility of unknown new physics at large values of @xmath254 .",
    "the gauge invariant arguments of losic & unruh appear to cast doubt on the idea that perturbation theory remains globally well defined for an indefinite period in de sitter or nearly de sitter spacetimes .    except in special cases , such as single - field inflation",
    ", the study of correlations generated near exit from inflation is still ultraviolet - sensitive ( in the sense of physics at large values of @xmath254 ) and infrared - sensitive ( in the sense of physics on very large lengthscales ) , because we do not know in which reheating minimum inflation is likely to terminate .",
    "this need not be a problem if observation can accurately determine the properties of our local minimum . in that case",
    "we would be able to understand all the properties of our vacuum , but we would not be able to understand how to embed this minimum in the larger landscape of the inflationary potential .",
