    "cosmic superstrings can be formed as a result of brane annihilations in the context of brane - world scenario  @xcite . in the brane - world models , brane inflation takes place  @xcite while two branes move towards each other , and their annihilation releases the brane tension energy that heats up the universe to start the hot big bang era .",
    "typically , strings of all sizes and types may be produced during the collision .",
    "considering a iib string theory in a ( 9 + 1)-dimensional space - time , interactions of dirichlet ( d ) branes leads to the _ unwinding _ and subsequent _ evaporation _ of higher dimensionality branes , with the survival of three - dimensional ( d3 ) branes embedded in a ( 9 + 1)-dimensional bulk  one of which could play the rle of our universe  and d1-branes ( d - strings )  @xcite .",
    "large fundamental ( f ) strings and d - strings that survive the cosmological evolution become cosmic superstrings .",
    "they are of cosmological size and could play the rle of cosmic strings  @xcite , false vacuum remnants formed generically at the end of hybrid inflation within grand unified theories  @xcite .",
    "cosmic superstrings have gained a lot of interest , particularly since it is believed that they may be observed in the sky , providing both , a means of testing string theory and a hint for a physically motivated inflationary model ( for a recent review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "brane collisions lead also to the formation of bound states , @xmath2-strings , which are composites of @xmath0 f - strings and @xmath1 d - strings  @xcite . the presence of stable bound states implies the existence of junctions , where two different types of string meet at a point and form a bound state leading away from that point .",
    "thus , when cosmic superstrings of different types collide , they can not intercommute , instead they exchange partners and form a @xmath3-junction , as a consequence of charge conservation at the junction of colliding @xmath4-strings .",
    "the evolution of f , d strings and their bound states is a rather complicated problem , which necessitates both numerical as well as analytical investigations .",
    "junctions may prevent the network from achieving a _ scaling _ solution , invalidating the cosmological model leading to their formation . in a number of studies ,",
    "cosmic superstring evolution has been addressed via numerical experiments  @xcite .",
    "the formation of three - string junctions and kinematic constraints for their collisions have been also investigated analytically  @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we address the question of the effect of junctions in the evolution of a cosmic superstring network , being composed by three components : @xmath0 f - strings , @xmath1 d - strings and their @xmath2 bound states . the results of our numerical investigations can be summarised as follows .",
    "firstly , there is clear evidence for _ scaling _ of all three components of the network , independently of the chosen initial configurations .",
    "secondly , the existence of bound states effects the evolution of the network .",
    "thirdly , for @xmath2 strings there is a supplementary energy loss mechanism , in addition to the chopping off of loops , and it is this new mechanism that allows the network to scale .",
    "more precisely , the additional energy loss mechanism is the formation of bound states , whose length increases , lowering the overall energy of the network .",
    "we note that in our simulations we can have control over the initial population of bound states , and this renders our novel results particularly important .",
    "we adopt the model of ref .",
    "this is a simple field theory model of @xmath5 bound states , in analogy to the abelian higgs model , which incorporates the main features of string theory . to represent the two different species of strings , the model includes two complex scalar fields , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , of the abelian higgs model , coupled via a potential , so that bound states can be formed .",
    "the presence of stable bound states implies the existence of junctions , where two different types of string meet at a point and form a bound state leading away from that point .",
    "we distinguish two different cases of cosmic superstring networks .",
    "the nature of cosmic superstrings depends on the particular brane inflationary model leading to their formation . in the case",
    "that both species of cosmic strings are bps , the model is described by the action  @xcite : @xmath8~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the covariant derivative @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 for clarity in our discussion , we label the @xmath6 field as `` higgs '' and the @xmath7 field as `` axion '' , even though both fields are higgs - like . the scalars are coupled to the u(1 ) gauge fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 and field strength tensors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the scalar potentials are parametrised by the positive constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .    in the case",
    "that one species of string is non - bps , we remove the second gauge field by setting @xmath19 . in this way",
    ", this species of string is represented by the topological defect of a complex scalar field with a global u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "such defects are characterised by the existence of long - range interactions @xcite  as opposed to local strings in which all energy density is confined within the string , so that local strings have only gravitational interactions  implying different consequences for the evolution of the network .",
    "in flat space the classical equations of motion for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 fields , obtained from the above action , eq .",
    "( [ equ : action ] ) , read  @xcite @xmath20 by calculating numerically the tension of the @xmath5 strings , for a range of values of the charges , and then fitting the data to the square - root expression @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the effective fundamental string tension after compactification and @xmath23 stands for the string coupling , we check  @xcite the validity of our model .",
    "we remind to the reader that eq .",
    "( [ pq_tension ] ) is exact only in the bps limit .",
    "the potential is chosen such that bound states are energetically preferred over single strings .",
    "this can be seen from the form of the potential for the axion strings . at the core of the higgs string the field vanishes , @xmath24 , and",
    "therefore the potential of the axion vanishes as well .",
    "therefore it is energetically favourable for the axion string to be located at the core of the higgs string . in the true vacuum of the higgs",
    ", we have @xmath25 , so the axion string behaves just like the higgs string .",
    "we employ this model to study , via numerical simulations , overall properties of the cosmic superstring network .",
    "in particular , we are interested in investigating the effect of junctions and their rle in achieving _ scaling _ of the network .    in the actual simulations we include the expansion of the universe by considering strings of fixed co - moving thickness , according to the model of refs .",
    "@xcite . in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe and considering the temporal gauge , @xmath26 , the equations of motion for the scalar fields take the form : _ 0f_0i + 2(1-s)f_0i & = & 2a^2se_1im^*d^+",

    "we set @xmath28 , instead of the @xmath29 required by the continuum - limit of the equations of motion ( otherwise the defects will _ fall through the lattice _ ) ; we also take , for simplicity , @xmath30 .",
    "we calculate the correlation length using the expression : =  , where @xmath31 is the volume of the simulation box and @xmath32 is the total length of the string network inside the box ( following the same approach as for example in ref .",
    "we identify the location of the string by the value of the scalar fields .",
    "we present our main results for the _ scaling _ of @xmath5 string networks , using simulations of the classical time evolution on lattices with three spatial dimensions .",
    "we consider two types of networks , namely local - global and local - local networks .",
    "the axion field has a global u(1 ) symmetry , and therefore the axion strings display long - range interactions .",
    "the lattice discretisation of the equations of motion is discussed in ref .",
    "we choose all parameters of the lagrangian to have _ natural _ values , @xmath33 the lattice spacing is @xmath34 , roughly half the characteristic length scale set by the masses of the scalar and gauge fields in the broken phase .",
    "the time - step is @xmath35 .",
    "the simulations are carried out with boxes of volume @xmath36 .    for each of the two ( local - global and local - local ) networks we consider two types of initial conditions : one in which a large percentage of strings ( @xmath37 50 % of the string length ) is in bound states , and the other one with a small percentage of strings (",
    "@xmath37 2 % of the string length ) is in bound states .",
    "we are able to achieve the small bound state percentage configuration , by starting with a large percentage configuration and then _ shifting _ one of the fields by roughly half the initial correlation length .",
    "the type of behaviour we observe is that in most cases the string network does have a _ scaling _ behaviour , but the slope , @xmath38 , of the correlation length , @xmath39 , versus time , defined by : ( ) =  , undergoes a discrete change as the network evolves .",
    "this change is most clearly visible in the case of a local - global string network , for both large and small amounts of bound states .",
    "the most dramatic change is that for the correlation length of the bound states themselves , provided the amount of bound states is small .    for local - local networks ,",
    "the change in correlation length is not detectable if there is a large amount of bound states , while if there is a small amount of bound states we find a case where the bound states themselves do not exhibit _ scaling _ behaviour .",
    "this violation of _ scaling _ by the bound states can be explained by taking into account that the formation of bound states gives an additional possibility for a network of @xmath5 strings to decrease its energy .",
    "therefore , the length of the bound states increases as a function of time , violating the _ scaling _ behaviour which requires the total length to decrease .",
    "once the length of the bound states have reach the maximum value , _ scaling _ resumes .",
    "this violation of _ scaling _ by the bound states does not lead to violation of _ scaling _ for the entire network , as it can be observed from the evolution of the higgs and axion strings .    in fig .",
    "[ lg_high ] we show the string correlation length for the higgs and axion fields , as well as for their bound states , as a function of time .",
    "the initial configuration is a local - global network with a large amount of bound states .",
    "clearly , there is convincing evidence for scaling of the three components of the network .",
    "this scaling is characterised with a distinct change of the correlation length slope during the network evolution .    ,",

    "the difference between the case plotted in fig .",
    "[ lg_low ] and the one plotted in fig .",
    "[ lg_high ] , is the percentage of initial bound states . as one can easily observe from fig .",
    "[ lg_low ] , if the initial state of a local - global network has a small amount of bound states , then the change of the correlation length slope during the evolution of the network is more acute .    ,",

    "[ ll_high ] , that for a local - local network with a large amount of bound states , all three components scale ( as for the local - global case ) , whereas the change in correlation lengths during evolution is not really apparent ( as opposed with the local - global case ) .    , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]    in fig",
    ".  [ ll_low ] , we plot the correlation length of the higgs , the axion and their bound states for a local - local network with a small amount of bound states . here",
    "we explicitly see that there is a violation of the _ scaling _ behaviour for the bound states , as a result of the increase of their length with time . as we have already mentioned earlier",

    "[ ah ] we show , for comparison , the correlation length of a single species of string , using the same initial data as the one used for the ( first ) higgs of the @xmath5 strings .",
    "clearly , there is no change in the slope of the correlation length as a function of time .",
    "this is an important check to assure that finite size effects do not influence the results of the simulations .",

    "in the context of brane - world models , brane collisions lead to the formation of large fundamental ( f ) strings and/or d1-branes ( d - strings ) .",
