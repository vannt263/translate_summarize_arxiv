    "` accretion disk corona ' ( adc ) sources such as 4u  2129 + 47  are believed to be near edge - on accreting systems since they have shown binary orbital modulation via broad , partial x - ray eclipses .",
    "such eclipses imply emission extended over radii comparable to the binary separation @xcite .",
    "studies of the adc x1822@xmath2371 offer an intriguing possibility for the cause of this very extended corona @xcite .",
    "orbital period derivative measurements imply that x1822@xmath2371 may be accreting very close to its eddington rate ; however , only a very small fraction of the eddington flux is observed .",
    "if the mass transfer from the secondary is actually accreted by the primary , then the adc must either be very optically thin ( the tacit assumption made for ` on state ' emission of 4u  2129 + 47  by garcia & grindlay 1987 ) , or very optically thick .",
    "if the latter is true , the released accretion energy may not be able to diffuse out of the flow on a viscous inflow time scale , and the corona will essentially become an ` advection dominated accretion flow ' ( adaf ; esin , narayan , & mcclintock 1997 , and references therein ) . in order to dissipate the accretion energy ,",
    "an adiabatic outflow might ensue at large radius ( ` adiabatic inflow / outflow solution ' , adios ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) , hence creating the adc .",
    "the adc source 4u  2129 + 47  is strongly believed to be a neutron star since it has exhibited a type i x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "its classification as an adc is due to the fact that prior to 1983 , 4u  2129 + 47   was observed to have a lightcurve similar to that of x1822@xmath2371 . over the 5.24hr orbit of 4u",
    "2129 + 47 , the eclipse width was @xmath3 in phase and @xmath4% of the x - rays were occulted at the eclipse midpoint .",
    "as hypothesized for x1822@xmath2371 , the adc might have been indicating the presence of an adios .",
    "since 1983 , 4u  2129 + 47  has been in a quiescent state .",
    "the question then arises as to whether the extended coronal structure has persisted or recurred in this state ( see garcia 1994 ; garcia & callanan 1999 ) .",
    "an extended coronal structure could signal the presence of an adios , albeit at low accretion rates where advection domination might ensue due to a decoupling of the ions and electrons .",
    "the bulk of the accretion energy would stored as thermal energy of the protons , which would then be lost as a wind rather than be dissipated on the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the spectra of quiescent neutron star sources might be due emission from their surface as they cool after a prior active accretion phase , or due to a low level of residual accretion @xcite .",
    "thermal emission from the neutron star surface has been suggested as partly contributing to the putative differences between the fluxes of quiescent neutron stars and quiescent black hole candidates , with the former class being suggested as systematically brighter @xcite .",
    "modern neutron star atmosphere models utilizing realistic opacities @xcite have yielded good fits to _ rosat _",
    "spectra of quiescent neutron stars , including quiescent spectra of 4u  2129 + 47   @xcite .",
    "the flux and color temperature of the spectrum are determined by the level of residual accretion and/or by the time averaged ( over @xmath5@xmath6yr time scales ) accretion rate in prior active phases @xcite .",
    "the degree to which residual heat dominates over active accretion in specific sources is a matter of current debate , with there being a recent suggestion that the quiescent flux level of 4u  2129 + 47  might be too low to be consistent with the cooling model @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that for quiescent neutron stars the `` propeller effect '' ( campana et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) halts , or at least greatly diminishes , the accretion rate onto the neutron star surface . the neutron star might then enter a radio pulsar phase , with x - ray emission arising from the interaction between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow from the secondary @xcite . the x - ray emission would be prominent at very large radii , comparable to the disk circularization radius . as in the outburst phase of 4u  2129 + 47 , this would imply that the x - ray emission would be gradually eclipsed over @xmath7 in orbital phase .",
    "a number of neutron star systems in quiescence have exhibited hard tails @xcite , which might be related to the shocked pulsar wind .",
    "the shocked wind emission might be in addition to and somewhat independent of any emission associated with the neutron star surface , i.e. , the hard tail could vary while the soft excess remained steady @xcite . the presence or absence of such a hard tail in the quiescent state of 4u  2129",
    "+ 47   has been impossible to determine with _ rosat",
    "_  observations ( 0.1 - 2.4kev ) , although those observations did suggest that the soft x - ray component was variable @xcite .",
    "4u  2129 + 47  has another very interesting property which relates to estimates of its quiescent flux .",
    "after 4u  2129 + 47  entered quiescence , optical modulation was no longer observed over its 5.24hr binary period . instead of finding its expected m or k type companion , a nearby late f type star was found @xcite , which has led to the hypothesis that the 4u  2129 + 47  system is a hierarchical triple .",
    "the f star would be in a few month orbit about the inner binary , which in turn could lead to modulations of the binary eccentricity on 50yr time scales @xcite .",
    "it is the optical measurements of this f star , which may or may not be related to the x - ray source , that yields the 6.3kpc distance that has been used by @xcite to determine the quiescent flux of 4u  2129 + 47 .",
    "we note that given a 6.3kpc distance , 4u  2129 + 47  is the third brightest quiescent neutron star in the @xcite sample .",
    "the _ chandra _  x - ray satellite , which provides excellent spatial resolution ( @xmath8 ) and good coverage in the soft x - ray band ( 0.510kev ) can help answer some of the questions concerning the 4u  2129 + 47  system . the high spatial resolution can determine whether or not the x - ray source is truly coincident with the observed f star .",
    "measurement of the eclipse can determine whether an extended coronal structure still exists and place constraints on the mass and radius of the secondary .",
    "the 0.52kev spectra can yield constraints on surface emission models , while the 210kev spectra can indicate whether 4u  2129 + 47  exhibits a hard tail similar to other quiescent neutron stars . to these ends , on 9 december 2000 , we obtained a 37ksec ( @xmath9 binary orbital periods ) observation of 4u  2129 + 47 .",
    "details of the observational modes and data extraction methods are presented in appendix  [ sec : extract ] .",
    "the discussion of our results is organized as follows .",
    "we first outline our data extraction methodology in  [ sec : extract ] . in  [ sec : astrometry ] we discuss the previous optical observations and the extent to which the x - ray source is coincident with the identified f star .",
    "we then present the x - ray lightcurve in  [ sec : curve ] and discuss its implications .",
    "we present orbital phase resolved spectroscopy in ",
    "[ sec : spec ] .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] , and suggest further observations with the _ x - ray multi - mirror mission ( xmm ) _ that can resolve the mysteries left unanswered by these _ chandra _  observations .",
    "so as not to deter the reader from the scientific results , some of the details of the analyses are relegated to the appendix , including discussion of the statistical methods used in analyzing the lightcurve ( appendix  [ sec : anal ] ) . in appendix",
    "[ sec : serendipity ] , we briefly discuss the sources that were serendipitously observed along with 4u  2129 + 47 .",
    "all observations of 4u  2129 + 47  described here were taken with the _ advanced camera from imaging spectroscopy _ ( _ acis _ ) on board the _ chandra _  x - ray satellite .",
    "specifically , they were taken with the backside illuminated s3 chip ( in imaging mode , i.e. , without the gratings inserted ) . to reduce the amount of spectral pile - up ( see below ) , we employed a 1/4 sub - array on all chips , yielding a frame readout time of 1.1sec .",
    "the total integration time was approximately 36.6ksec , with roughly a 96.5% observing efficiency ( see below ) , yielding 35.3ksec of on source time .",
    "data extraction and response matrix generation were performed with the ciao v2.2 analysis package and calibration products from caldb v2.9 .",
    "sources within the field of view were detected using the wavdetect program , and source counts were extracted from within the @xmath10 contours found from this analysis .",
    "the 4u  2129 + 47  background region was extracted from an annulus centered on the source with an inner radius of 5  and an outer radius of 14 .",
    "we include in our spectral _ and _ lightcurve analyses photons only in the 0.58kev range , and have rebinned the spectra to have between 2026 photons per spectral bin . in determining the error bars of the spectral parameters ,",
    "we have calculated the 90% confidence limits using the methods of @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath11 for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "we have not applied any systematic errors to the spectral energy bins .",
    "although the detected count rate from 4u  2129 + 47  was only @xmath12cps , the observation did suffer from a small degree of pile - up ( i.e. , two photons being detected as a single photon with their summed energy ) .",
    "an in depth discussion of pile - up , along with analysis methods that may be able to account partially for its effects , is presented by @xcite . in all fits",
    "presented in this work , we have employed the pile - up model of @xcite as implemented in isis v1.0.6 @xcite .    with a 1.1sec frame integration time and an @xmath13cps count rate ,",
    "we expect 28 double photon events over the course of our entire observation .",
    "roughly 95% of the detected photons land on the same @xmath14 pixel region , which implies that 10% of the double photon events were registered as individual photons , whereas the remaining 90% of the double events were potentially registered as a single photon .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in this latter number is the `` grade migration factor '' , @xmath15 , i.e. , the probability that the piled - up event is _ not _ rejected as a cosmic ray particle or other background event . in our use of the isis implementation of the model of @xcite",
    ", we have assumed that there is a 50% probability ( @xmath16 ) that two piled - up photons are accepted as a single `` good event '' .",
    "consistent with the above expectations , two lightcurve time bins show two distinguished photons . since the detected spectrum peaks at @xmath17kev , the majority of piled - up events accepted as photons likely were read as having energy @xmath18kev . even though we only expect @xmath19 piled - up events , as we discuss below there are only @xmath20 photons in the hard tail of our observed spectrum",
    "; therefore , pile - up does effect the fitted power law slope and amplitude .",
    "if @xmath16 is in fact too low a probability for accepting a piled - up event , then we have under subtracted the piled - up photons at 2kev and slightly overestimated the value of the photon index . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath16 is too large , then we have slightly underestimated the photon index , @xmath21 . to date , there has been no independent calibration of the value of @xmath15 ( which in reality is likely to be energy and chip location dependent ) in the _ chandra _   detectors .",
    "our estimates are that for the fits described below these systematic effects lead to at most @xmath22 .",
    "based upon the assumption of roche lobe overflow and a main sequence mass - radius relationship , the 5.24hr orbital period of 4u  2129 + 47  suggests a secondary mass of @xmath23 , which corresponds to an m or k dwarf .",
    "it was expected that optical observations of the 4u  2129 + 47  system in quiescence would reveal strong ellipsoidal variations .",
    "instead , @xcite observed a system exhibiting an f star with no detectable orbital modulations .",
    "comparison of the position of this quiescent optical source with the position of the optical counterpart of 4u  2129 + 47  in outburst revealed the two sources to be coincident within 0.3 ; therefore , @xcite considered the possibility that the 4u  2129 + 47  system might be a triple . with higher resolution optical observations",
    ", @xcite showed that the 4u  2129 + 47  field was fairly crowded , but that there were no obvious contaminating sources .",
    "these authors favored the triple hypothesis .",
    "@xcite found that the f star exhibited spectroscopic velocity modulations on the order of tens of km  s@xmath24 on the time scale of months , which they also attributed to the system being a triple .    in table",
    "[ tab : optical ] we list some of the optical identifications made for the quiescent counterpart to 4u  2129 + 47 . all spectroscopic observations , ranging from 22007500 , agree on some type of f star identification for this counterpart , and most observations suggest an extinction of @xmath25 .",
    "if the x - ray source is at the same distance as the f star , then it is at a distance of @xmath268kpc .",

    "one of the main goals of our observation was to determine whether or not the broad , partial dip seen in the outburst lightcurve of 4u  2129 + 47   @xcite persisted into quiescence .",
    "@xcite did not detect any evidence of an eclipse in quiescence ( see below ) , while @xcite found only weak evidence for an eclipse and could not distinguish among total and partial eclipse models .",
    "the folded lightcurve from our observation , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcurve ] , removes any ambiguity and shows that the eclipse is rapid , total , and of shorter duration than in outburst .",
    "the eclipse duration is @xmath32sec ( see appendix  [ sec : anal ] ) , i.e. , 0.08 in binary phase .",
    "this is 2.5 times narrower than in outburst .",
    "no photons are detected over the course of the eclipse , which implies that the 3@xmath33 upper limit to the mean observed count rate during eclipse is @xmath34cps .",
    "given the mean count rate out of eclipse , the eclipsing object exhibits an optical depth of @xmath35 with 99.9% confidence , and @xmath36 with 95% confidence .",
    "in addition to the eclipse , the lightcurve exhibits a sinusoidal modulation .",
    "fitting the lightcurve outside of eclipse with a function @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 is the observed rate and @xmath39 is the orbital phase ( @xmath40 is the midpoint of the eclipse ) , we find @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( 90% confidence levels ) . note that this sinusoidal modulation is similar to that exhibited by x1822@xmath2371 in its bright state (",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , where it is believed that modulation is due to interactions of the accretion stream with the accretion disk .",
    "thus the sinusoidal modulation may be indicating the presence of an active accretion stream and a disk about the neutron star .",
    "note that @xcite in three separate , short _ rosat - hri _ observations found evidence of variability . due to the fact that these observations were spread over the span of a month",
    ", one could argue whether intrinsic source variability or orbital modulation was observed .",
    "the sinusoidal modulation observed here is roughly consistent , in both phase and amplitude , with the x - ray variability described by @xcite ( who likely detected little , if any , of the actual eclipse ) .",
    "thus , whereas the quiescent lightcurve of 4u  2129 + 47  has changed from that in outburst @xcite , it is possible that the quiescent lightcurve has remained remarkably steady , at least in shape and _ relative _ amplitude , during quiescence .    with an accurate measurement of the eclipse",
    ", we can update the ephemeris presented by @xcite .",
    "the barycenter corrected julian date of the first eclipse ( @xmath44 ) in our lightcurve is @xmath45 which is 0.0293days later than expected from the @xcite ephemeris .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to either the uncertainty in the original orbital period determination , or due to orbital evolution . adding a quadratic term to the @xcite ephemeris , and propagating errors",

    "orbital evolution is indicated , but only at the 2@xmath33 level . converting this into an orbital period derivative , we find @xmath49    due to the possibility of winds , magnetic torques , etc .",
    ", it can problematic to convert an observed period derivative directly into an implied accretion rate ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * for a general discussion of the role of some of these effects ) .",
    "however , if the above period derivative is real and solely due to accretion from the secondary to the compact object , the implied accretion rate averaged over the past twenty years is @xmath50 .",
    "given that 4u  2129 + 47  has been in quiescence over most of this time , this would imply an extremely large accretion rate in outburst , and/or substantial mass loss without radiation , i.e. , an adios , in quiescence .",
    "comparably large orbital period derivatives and implied mean accretion rates have been found for x1822@xmath2371 @xcite .",
    "we can also determine an ephemeris for the _ average _ period .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath51 where the period at the time of these observations might be as much as @xmath52days longer than the above average period .",
    "the fact that the eclipses observed with _ chandra _",
    "are total and only 0.08 wide in phase already indicates that the x - ray emission is emanating from a region nearly two times smaller than in outburst .",
    "the rapidity with which eclipse ingress and egress occurs , however , can place even tighter constraints .",
    "assuming that the eclipse is total and that eclipsing medium has a sharp edge , then the time it takes for the count rate to go from the mean count rate down to zero , or the reverse , is indicative of the size of the x - ray source . as described in appendix  [ sec : anal ] , we have performed a statistical analysis of the eclipse ingress and egress , and show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : egress ] .",
    "we have averaged the two ingresses with each other , and the two egresses with each other , but we have not averaged the ingresses with the egresses . at the 95% confidence level , the average ingress is more rapid than 170sec , while the average egress is more rapid than 217sec .",
    "this implies that the x - ray source diameter is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the binary separation . for a total system mass of 2@xmath55",
    ", this implies an x - ray diameter of @xmath56 cm ( approximately 7 earth diameters ) .",
    "this is approximately a factor of 15 smaller than the implied x - ray source diameter for 4u  2129 + 47  in outburst @xcite .",
    "an important caveat for the above estimates is that they pertain to the 0.58kev lightcurve only , and are dominated by emission from @xmath57kev .",
    "thus , we are unable to distinguish between different source sizes above and below 2kev , as have been hypothesized @xcite .",
    "we also note that for the most part , each individual ingress and egress looked statistically identical , with the exception of the second egress .",
    "there was week evidence for a prolonged period of decreased emission towards the beginning of the second egress .",
    "this was most readily noted by the fact that the 1@xmath33 limit for the second eclipse egress was 260sec , as opposed to 130170sec for the other ingresses and egress .",
    "accretion `` dips '' , due to `` blobs '' of enhanced neutral hydrogen column are in fact common near zero phase in cyg  x-1 , for example ( see bauciska - church et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "perhaps a similar occurrence is being hinted at here , although the statistics are not strong enough to say with any degree of certainty whether or not this is the case .",
    "the lightcurve not only places constraints upon the x - ray source diameter , but the measured eclipse duration also places constraints upon the parameters of the secondary , specifically its mass and radius absorption line and a double peaked he  ii 4686 emission line .",
    "the two measurements together implied a primary and secondary mass of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "these estimates , however , are hampered by uncertainties in modeling the outburst emission of the secondary and disk , as well as by any possible contamination from the f star .",
    "] here we calculate the mass ratio of the secondary to the primary , @xmath60 , as a function of inclination angle , @xmath61 . assuming that the secondary completely fills its roche lobe , which we approximate as spherical , then the ratio of the eclipse duration to the orbital period is given by @xmath62 where @xmath54 is the orbital separation of the binary and @xmath63 is the roche lobe radius of the secondary . utilizing the approximation of @xcite , this can be rewritten as @xmath64 where @xmath65^{3/2 } \\cr q_1 & \\equiv & \\frac{81}{8 } \\left [ 2 \\cos^2 i -   \\theta^2     \\right ] \\left",

    "the other interesting aspect to note about the observed lightcurve is that the position of the ( out of eclipse ) lightcurve minimum occurs at a completely different phase than in outburst . in the lightcurve presented by @xcite ,",

    "postulating a larger neutron star radius of 10 km yields a lower temperature of @xmath91kev consistent with that found by @xcite using these same models to describe the _ pspc _   data ; however , the inferred distance is then rather small",
    ". the 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath92kpc is less than most of the distance estimates based upon optical studies of the f star .",
    "( note that the fit with the fixed 10 km radius also yielded the largest fitted value of the neutral column . ) assuming instead a neutron star radius of 5 km yields distance estimates consistent with those of the f star .",
    "it had already been noted by @xcite that the neutral column obtained from the orbital phase - averaged _ rosat _  _ pspc _   spectrum was too large to be consistent with the reddening of the f star . using our typical fitted column of @xmath93 implies e(b@xmath2v)@xmath94 @xcite , whereas the e(b@xmath2v)@xmath95 measured by @xcite implies a column of @xmath96 .",
    "phase resolved spectroscopy offers a possible solution to this discrepancy .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcurve ] , there is clear phase - dependent variability . extracting spectra at orbital phases 0.20.5 and 0.650.958",
    ", the variation appears to be consistent with changes in the soft spectrum only .",
    "( the statistics of the hard tail above 2kev become poor in each phase bin , but are consistent with a constant amplitude and slope . )",
    "we therefore have chosen to perform a series of fits where below 2kev we consider the above two orbital phases , while above 2kev we use the spectrum from the total observation , excluding the eclipse .",
    "we constrain all model parameters , including normalizations , to be the same for each of these spectra , except that we allow the neutral column to be different in each orbital phase .",
    "( for the hard tail , we constrain the neutral column to be the same as for orbital phases 0.650.958 . )",
    "all three spectra are fitted simultaneously , and the results are presented in table  [ tab : fit ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : phased ] . as for our orbital phase - averaged spectra ,",
    "we present a simple blackbody model ( model b ) , and neutron star atmosphere models with fixed distances ( model d ) or radii ( models f , h ) .",
    "overall these fits are fairly good , and we see that the fitted temperatures , radii , distances , and power law parameters are very comparable to those obtained for the phase - averaged fits . the neutral column is seen to vary by nearly a factor of two between the two phases , with the lower column value being a factor of only 10 - 70% larger than would be implied by the f star reddening .",
    "the averages of the two column values are approximately the same as the columns determined from the phase - averaged fits .",
    "the spectral variations are therefore consistent with being solely due to variations of the intrinsic column , with the total column having roughly equal contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic columns .",
    "as regards the power law components in these fits , all fits imply that the power law comprises @xmath97 of the ( unabsorbed ) 0.58kev flux .",
    "the error bars are large ; however , the index of the power law is consistent with being fairly flat .",
    "we note that , if anything , changing our assumptions regarding pile - up is most likely to further flatten the power law ( see  [ sec : extract ] ) . in terms of amplitude , slope , and extent ,",
    "such a power law is difficult to describe solely using a neutron star atmosphere model .",
    "our _ chandra _  observations of 4u  2129 + 47  have revealed that the previously observed extended coronal structure has collapsed by at least a factor of 15 in size .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum is now consistent with thermal emission from the surface of a neutron star with radius on the order of 5 km . to",
    "what extent this emission is indicative of residual thermal emission or active , albeit low - level , accretion , remains unclear .",
    "the fact that the spectrum observed by _ chandra _  is consistent in amplitude and shape with that observed by _",
    "rosat _  in 1994 can easily be accommodated for in the cooling neutron star model , as the cooling time scale is expected to be very long .",
    "the prior observed soft x - ray variability @xcite can be accounted for via orbital phase - dependent obscuration effects , rather than intrinsic accretion variability .    on the other hand , questions concerning the cooling model",
    "first , assuming a distance of 6kpc , consistent with various estimates of the f star distance , the fitted neutron star radius tends to be be fairly low , on the order of 5 km .",
    "although larger than the inferred blackbody radius , this is smaller than expectations from numerous neutron star models . forcing a large neutron star radius , 10 km ,",
    "implies a distance substantially less than most estimates of the f star distance , which of course might still be a chance overlap .",
    "however , it is seen that each of the various fits , including the simple blackbody , are statistically nearly identical to one another .",
    "second , the variability discussed by @xcite is consistent , in amplitude and phase , with that observed here , which indicates that roughly 2/3 of the integration time from the 1992 _ hri _  observation occurred over the phases of _ lowest _ emission . thus the estimate of an approximate factor of two flux difference between 1992 and 1994 might be an _ underestimate _ , although this is hampered by the poor spectral resolution of the _",
    "hri_. @xcite argue that this change might be related to solely the outer crust cooling .",
    "additionally , this change in flux might indicate that as of 1992 , 4u  2129 + 47   had not yet truly entered into a quiescent phase .    based upon the work of @xcite and the observations discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "@xcite has suggested that the quiescent phase of 4u  2129 + 47  might be too faint to be consistent with the neutron star cooling model .",
    "specifically , one expects a quiescent flux of @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the average flux in outburst , @xmath100 is the average time the source spends in outburst , and @xmath101 is the average time spent in quiescence . assuming a typical accretion efficiency of @xmath102 , and an average accretion rate of @xmath103 , as suggested by the possible period derivative found in  [ sec : curve ] , we then find that @xmath104 to accommodate the above result , either the assumed accretion rate is atypically large ( i.e. , not indicative of the long term average in outburst ) , the durations of the quiescent periods are very long , there is enhanced cooling of the neutron star during quiescence ( see wijnands 2002 , wijnands et al . 2002 , and references therein ) , or the efficiency is very low .    if one instead assumes an average outburst flux of @xmath105 ( i.e. , 5 times the typical 210kev flux seen in outburst ; @xcite and references therein ) , then one obtains @xmath106 .",
    "however , this estimate assumes that one has observed nearly all of the outburst flux in the system , contrary to the more usual assumptions for an adc of either a very optically thin or very optically thick coronae seen near edge on @xcite . in order to retain the typical adc assumptions , one",
    "is again drawn toward hypotheses of the previous outburst episode being atypically bright , long quiescent periods , enhanced neutron star cooling , or very low radiative efficiencies .",
    "given that any matter that reaches the neutron star surface will contribute towards heating the neutron star , the latter hypothesis implies that inefficiency during outburst is achieved via an outflow , e.g. , an adios .",
    "questions remain about the origin of the sinusoidal variability and the power law tail .",
    "the former is similar to what has been observed in x1822@xmath2371 , where the variability has been associated with the interaction of the accretion stream with the outer edge of an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "a similar model for 4u  2129 + 47   could argue for active accretion .",
    "observations of x1822@xmath2371 imply that a totally opaque disk rim is raised that completely blocks the central neutron star , while a more vertically extended disk atmosphere ( with @xmath107 ) attenuates the extended corona @xcite . here",
    "the evidence suggests that the neutron star in 4u  2129 + 47  is directly observable , while the combination of inclination angle and outer disk atmosphere height serves only to attenuate its soft flux with a column of @xmath108 .",
    "the presence of the hard tail might also argue for active accretion .",
    "the limited _ chandra _  band pass shows that at least @xmath97 of the total , unabsorbed 0.58kev luminosity emanates from this component .",
    "thus we might be seeing the accretion energy first being funneled through a corona , and then actively being dissipated as thermal energy on the neutron star surface .    one alternative that preserves",
    "the cooling model would be for the accretion stream to be halted by an outgoing pulsar wind @xcite .",
    "the hard tail would represent shocked emission from the interaction region of the wind and accretion stream .",
    "the sinusoidal modulation could still be due a neutral hydrogen column being raised by the interaction of the accretion stream with a disk rim . such a disk need not be actively accreting , however , as the pulsar wind and magnetic field could halt any inward flow of disk material .",
    "we note that the disk radius inferred from the location of the light curve minimum is comparable to expectations from the pulsar wind model ; however , the soft flux radius determined from the rapidity of the eclipse is somewhat smaller .",
    "the _ chandra _  observations have lent further credence to the hypothesis that the 4u  2129 + 47  system is a hierarchical triple .",
    "the x - ray source position is now seen to be even more closely aligned with optical position of the f star . furthermore , the minimum fitted neutral column ( i.e. , the flux from the maximum emission phase of the lightcurve ) is more consistent with the reddening of the f star than were previous measurements obtained from phase - averaged spectra .",
    "prospects are good for refining the answers to some of the remaining questions about 4u  2129 + 47 . further observations with either _ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _ , aside from improving the statistics of the model fits , might reveal variability .",
    "variability in the soft spectra would argue against the cooling model be the sole source of quiescent emission .",
    "_ xmm - newton _  observations can have direct bearing upon the pulsar wind models for the hard tail . aside from extending detection of this tail to beyond 8kev ( which would rule out most atmosphere models for the hard tail ) , the methods of  [ sec : curve ] then could be applied separately to the hard tail .",
    "measurement of three or more eclipses would allow one to place limits of @xmath109 on the diameter of the hard component emission region .",
    "although large , this is a smaller diameter than suggested by many of the pulsar wind models .    additionally , each _ xmm - newton _  observation can determine the eclipse centroid to approximately @xmath110sec .",
    "if the f star is truly in a month long orbit about the binary , then we expect @xmath111sec variations in the eclipse ephemeris . thus , multiple _ xmm - newton _   observations spaced out over a month long time scale could directly determine the orbital parameters of a third body . in the absence of the detection of such orbital variations , either _",
    "chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _   observations could determine whether or not the orbital period evolution hinted at in the analysis of  [ sec : curve ] actually occurred . this in turn ,",
    "as discussed above , could have implications for the expected level of quiescent emission in the cooling neutron star model .",

    "in what follows , we explicitly ignore the effects of detector `` deadtime '' . each _",
    "chandra _  frame for this observation represented an integration time of approximately 1.1s with a `` frame transfer time '' of 40ms between frames .",
    "the effective deadtime therefore was on the order of 3.5% , which is negligible for the purposes of this analysis .",
    "we shall employ a bayesian approach .",
    "the following discussion pertains to eclipse egress ; however , it is readily generalized to ingress as well .",
    "we label our @xmath112s time bins with indices @xmath113 , and assume that at the beginning of the time bin indexed by 0 , the x - ray source is fully eclipsed , and by the beginning of the time bin indexed by @xmath114 it is fully unobscured .",
    "we assume that the mean count rate measured at the detector increases linearly from 0 to @xmath115 ( although other assumptions are readily accommodated ) . the mean count rate in time bin @xmath61 is therefore @xmath116 , for @xmath117 . following the usual derivation of poisson statistics",
    ", we assume that each bin is short enough such that the probability of measuring one photon event in a given bin is @xmath118 , the probability of measuring no events is @xmath119 , and that @xmath120 .",
    "the probability of the data , @xmath121 , given this model is therefore @xmath122 where the product over @xmath61 is for those bins where a photon was detected , and the product over @xmath123 is for those bins where no photons were detected .",

    "we allow for uncertainty in this start point by assuming that its prior probability is uniformly distributed between 0 and 500s before the first detected photon .",
    "( [ eq : pdak ] ) then must be slightly modified by including in the sum within the exponential all the time bins from 500s before the first detected photon to the time bin represented by index 0 .",
    "the above was used to calculate probability distributions separately for the two measured eclipse ingresses and the two measured eclipse egresses .",
    "the probability distributions were then multiplied together for each pair to give the ingress and egress distributions for the folded lightcurve .",
    "marginalizing over the eclipse sharpness yielded the eclipse widths and midpoints , while marginalizing over the eclipse start points yielded the distributions for the eclipse sharpness ( see  [ sec : curve ] ) .",
    "a number of other sources were serendipitously observed within a few arcminute radius of 4u  2129 + 47 .",
