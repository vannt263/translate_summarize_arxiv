    "<S> furthermore for uniform data on the real line , the exact and asymptotic distribution of the domination number of cccds were analytically available . in this article , we determine some appealing properties of the spherical proximity map in compact intervals on the real line and use these properties as a guideline for defining new proximity maps in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> delaunay triangulation is used to partition the region of interest in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we introduce the auxiliary tools used for the construction of the new proximity maps , as well as some related concepts that will be used in the investigation and comparison of them and the resulting graphs . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the geometry invariance of pcds for uniform data . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide some newly defined proximity maps in higher dimensions as illustrative examples .    </S>",
