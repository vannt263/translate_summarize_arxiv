    "there is an old belief that the electroweak standard theory possesses a first order phase transition @xcite-@xcite at some temperature of the order of the @xmath3 mass .",
    "this phase transition has become subject of intensive studies in the last years , in particular its dependence on the mass of the so far elusive higgs boson .",
    "one motivation was the phenomenological interest in baryon asymmetry generation at the electroweak scale .",
    "the transition has to be strong enough , both in order to accomplish a sufficient rate of baryon generation during the transition and to prevent the wash  out of baryon number after it is completed .",
    "the present quantitative understanding of possible mechanisms as well as experimental lower bounds for the higgs mass make this unlikely within the minimal standard model .",
    "a second reason was the wish to control the behaviour of perturbative calculations of the effective action .",
    "this quantity is the appropriate tool of ( non  lattice ) thermal quantum field theory for dealing with symmetry breaking .",
    "infrared problems prevent a perturbative evaluation of the free energy in the symmetric phase to higher loop order .",
    "however , the true , non  perturbative nature of the symmetric phase will be characterized by massive @xmath3 and higgs bound states instead of massless @xmath3 gauge bosons . a selfconsistent approach to provide masses across the transition , e.g. by gap equations , can improve the ability to calculate perturbatively the symmetric phase .",
    "gauge field condensates are another property of the symmetric phase , expected to lower its free energy density .",
    "an independent method is needed to characterize the electroweak phase transition even within a pure @xmath2 gauge  higgs version of the theory .",
    "this model has become a testfield to control the validity of perturbative predictions over a broad range of higgs masses . at present , one is interested to see whether the first order transition ends somewhere around a higgs mass @xmath4 gev .",
    "lattice simulations @xcite-@xcite are not only able to describe both phases starting from first principles but , moreover , make it possible to put both phases into coexistence near the phase equilibrium .",
    "thus one is able to measure directly quantities like latent heat , surface tension , condensates etc . quantifying the strength of the transition .",
    "one approach to lattice calculations of the electroweak transition is based on an effective @xmath5dimensional higgs model .",
    "it is attractive phenomenologically because it circumvents the problem of putting chiral fermions on the lattice . due to dimensional reduction , fermions as well as non ",
    "static bosonic modes contribute to the effective action .",
    "in contrast to qcd , dimensional reduction should work for the electroweak theory around and above the transition temperature because @xmath6 is small .",
    "for the electroweak phase transition this approach has been pioneered by farakos et al .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this program aims at exploring the accuracy of dimensional reduction at various higgs masses by comparing various parameters of the transition with those of @xmath7dimensional lattice and perturbative approaches .",
    "perturbation theory is necessary to relate the @xmath7dimensional continuum theory to the parameters of the dimensionally reduced theory and , finally , to the bare coupling parameters of the lattice action .",
    "dimensionally reduced versions retain the remnant of the temporal gauge field @xmath8 ( as an adjoint higgs field ) or not ( as in this work ) .    recently @xcite we have presented results obtained with the @xmath5-dimensional lattice model on the phase transition for @xmath1 gev . here",
    "we present some results of numerical work on the more realistic @xmath9 gev and compare them with the case of smaller higgs mass .",
    "as expected the first order nature has become weaker but is still evident . in this",
    "talk we put our main emphasis on ways to characterize the phase equilibrium at finite lattice size in order to obtain the infinite volume limit of the transition parameters , and on non  perturbative features of the symmetric phase .",
    "the extrapolation to the continuum limit will be dealt with in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "we study the @xmath2higgs system with one complex higgs doublet of variable modulus .",
    "the gauge field is represented by the unitary @xmath10 link matrices @xmath11 and the higgs fields are written as @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the higgs modulus squared , @xmath14 an element of the group @xmath2 ) .",
    "the lattice action is @xmath15 with @xmath16 . in three dimensions",
    "the lattice higgs self  coupling is @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the 3@xmath20 continuum gauge and higgs self couplings which are 3@xmath20 renormalization group invariants .",
    "they are related to the corresponding four dimensional couplings via @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "string operators like @xmath23 ( of extension @xmath24 ) are used to form higgs and @xmath3-operators .",
    "actually the @xmath25 masses ( inverse correlation lengths ) have been obtained from the connected correlators between separated  time slice  ( in @xmath26 dimensions ! ) sums of  spatial  string operators , which project out the proper @xmath2 and spin content .",
    "the overlap with the lowest mass states is improved choosing an extension @xmath27 for correlators in the @xmath3 and also partly in the higgs channel ( there also @xmath28 is used ) .",
    "a static force is ( formally ) defined using wilson loops @xmath29 of asymmetric extensions @xmath30",
    "( @xmath31 is the lattice size ) .",
    "the bare lattice coupling parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be translated into a physical temperature by a formula which generalizes the tree level relation between the higgs mass and the bare lattice parameters including perturbative corrections ( too complicated to be given here ) .",
    "we consider here the quartic coupling @xmath34 .",
    "according to the tree level based relation @xmath35 this would correspond to the case of @xmath36 gev .",
    "corrections to this approximate relation depend on details of the dimensional reduction ( loop order , the adjoint higgs field @xmath8 integrated out or not ) .",
    "taking these corrections into account ( @xmath7dimensional renormalization effects are neglected ) this coupling ratio corresponds to @xmath37 gev for @xmath38 . for comparison ,",
    "the lower higgs mass had been simulated with @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 gev .",
    "the lattice higgs self coupling @xmath33 is not fixed but runs with @xmath32 .",
    "this is important for the multihistogram technique to be used . in general",
    ", binning has to be performed in the _ two relevant parts _ of the action ( corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and some other observable .",
    "our data come from typically @xmath41 configurations per set of couplings ( separated by one heat bath step mixed with eight higgs field reflections ) .",
    "correlation measurements were separated by @xmath42 iterations .",
    "in order to characterize the order of the phase transition at higgs mass @xmath9 gev and to obtain the infinite volume critical hopping parameter @xmath43 we have simulated lattice sizes @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to control the approach to the continuum limit we have chosen gauge couplings @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( not presented here ) . lattice observables to monitor",
    "the phase transition are the higgs modulus squared @xmath49 and the link contribution to the action @xmath50 , but other pure gauge field quantities like the average plaquette or the polyakov line give @xmath51state signals , too .",
    "we have used the ferrenberg  swendsen analysis and present here only results obtained for histograms of @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding binder cumulants @xmath52 are shown for the lattice sizes @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in fig . [ cumulant ] the minima give the respective pseudocritical @xmath56 . from a linear extrapolation with @xmath57 we obtain the infinite volume limit @xmath58 .",
    "for comparison , the maxima of the @xmath49 susceptibility give @xmath59 . in the case of a @xmath2 higgs model without @xmath60quark this value corresponds to @xmath61 gev . for comparison ,",
    "we obtain @xmath62 gev for @xmath1 gev .",
    "finiteness and shrinking of the binder cumulant with increasing volume are evidence for the first order nature of the transition at the larger higgs mass , too .",
    "the dip of the binder cumulant reaches @xmath63 in the @xmath64 limit clearly different from @xmath65 .",
    "alternatively we have used and improved the equal weight criterion for the localization of the transition . in order to account for mixing of broken and symmetric phases at some floating @xmath32",
    "_ inside the metastability range _ we make the superposition ansatz for the histogram : @xmath66 for finite volumes there is also a contribution of inhomogeneous states containing interfaces .",
    "all histograms as well as the sum of the appropriate thermodynamic weights @xmath67 are normalized .",
    "the histogram @xmath68 is obtained by reweighting towards @xmath32 , merging all data by the ferrenberg  swendsen method .",
    "the pure phase histograms should be provided by the same technique from data taken _ outside the metastable range_. our data are scarce there , however .    to obtain the pure phase histograms from runs in the metastability region",
    "one could use a selection procedure removing tunneling and excursions to the  wrong ",
    "phase from the monte carlo history .",
    "this method has been used to extract _ pure phase correlation lengths _ ( see below ) near @xmath69 .",
    "it is unsuitable for the extraction of the weights @xmath67 .",
    "we have defined _ pure phase histograms _ by gaussian fits to the outer flanks of the full histogram @xmath68 , which allows to define the weights as functions of @xmath32 and to determine the equilibrium point where @xmath70 .",
    "more information is given by the probability of mixed phase configurations , @xmath71 at @xmath72 and the slopes of @xmath73 and @xmath74 at intersection .",
    "the infinite volume limit of the pseudocritical couplings is @xmath75 .",
    "we show in fig.[histogram ] the full histogram @xmath76 at @xmath56 for the @xmath77 lattice and the contribution from inhomogeneous ( mixed phase ) configurations . for a lattice of this size ( in contrast to the smaller @xmath78 or @xmath53 ) the pure phase histograms do not overlap ,",
    "the gap is filled exclusively by inhomogeneous states .",
    "the present variant of the equal weight method for localizing the phase transition has the advantage to give an immediate estimate for the surface tension . it is safer than binders method which uses only the maxima and the minimum of @xmath79",
    "this is an important improvement for very asymmetric ( typical for higgs transitions ) and strongly overlapping histograms ( for all except the largest lattice sizes ) .",
    "the excess free energy per unit area of interphase surfaces @xmath80 can be obtained from @xmath81 where the weights are taken at @xmath72 ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath83 is the surface between the phases . the smallest surface @xmath83 is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "thus we obtain an estimate , @xmath85 at @xmath77 .",
    "the latent heat @xmath86 of the transition is given by the jump of the average higgs modulus squared according to @xmath87 the phase separated histograms with respect to @xmath49 at @xmath72 give @xmath88 slightly decreasing with growing lattice size .",
    "the infinite volume extrapolation with @xmath89 gives @xmath90 , which amounts to @xmath91 .",
    "for comparison , we have obtained @xmath92 for the case @xmath93 gev ( at @xmath47 , too ) .",
    "the equal weight method makes it possible to reconstruct the free energy densities of the pure phases in the vicinity of the phase equilibrium .",
    "the latent heat can then be expressed as the jump @xmath94 of the energy density by @xmath95 with derivatives taken at @xmath72 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath96 for @xmath77 .",
    "both methods give compatible results for @xmath94 in the infinite volume limit within an @xmath89 extrapolation .",
    "the jump in @xmath97 at the critical temperature ( at @xmath72 ) may be translated into continuum units @xmath98 this jump is independent of the @xmath5-dimensional renormalization scale @xmath99 , and is therefore more appropriate to consider than the higgs condensate itself . extrapolating to infinite volume we find @xmath100 ( at @xmath101 ) .",
    "this value may be compared with predictions from @xmath51loop perturbation theory ( in landau gauge ) @xcite @xmath102 .",
    "one has to realize that @xmath103 is not identical with the condensate value @xmath104 .",
    "there is a relation @xmath105 at @xmath34 and with a renormalization scale @xmath106 .",
    "we conclude that the phase transition at @xmath9 gev shows a clear @xmath51state signal , and quantities like the latent heat , the surface tension and the higgs condensate ( all scaled by an appropriate power of @xmath69 ) have a clearly non  vanishing infinite volume limit . for the latent heat and the surface tension it must be stressed that , contrary to the cases of very small higgs mass , the transition appears to be weaker than predicted by perturbation theory .",
    "this phase is characterized by a mass scale @xmath107 .",
    "it manifests itself e.g. in the string tension of the dimensionally reduced variant of the theory . as in the @xmath7dimensional theory",
    "a force can be defined formally between static non ",
    "abelian charges through creutz ratios of wilson loops . in a previous work @xcite",
    "we have calculated the force in the case of @xmath1 gev in the symmetric as well as in the broken phase .",
    "we have found a string tension @xmath108 in the symmetric phase , whereas it vanishes in the broken phase .",
    "this value has to be compared to @xmath109 for the @xmath5dimensional pure gauge theory @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ force ] we show the force in the symmetric phase for the cases @xmath1 gev and @xmath9 gev , both at @xmath47 . from these data for @xmath1 gev the above string tension had to be fitted .",
    "the errors are large but there is no evidence for the expected breakdown of confinement beyond some screening length . for @xmath9 gev ( due to the smaller @xmath3 mass in the symmetric phase compared to the lighter higgs case )",
    "the perturbative contribution extends further in distance .",
    "thus we can obtain only an upper bound for the string tension , @xmath110 .",
    "there is another possibility to calculate the string tension in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "we consider the ratio of wilson loops from _ both sides of the phase transition _ which amounts to a subtraction of the perturbative part .",
    "this allows to anticipate the string tension already at much smaller distance . by this method",
    "we make more precise for @xmath1 gev the string tension @xmath111 and predict @xmath112 for @xmath9 gev .    in order to characterize immediately the symmetric phase we have studied masses in various channels .",
    "the behaviour of two correlation lengths at @xmath113 gev with higgs and gauge boson quantum numbers is presented in fig .",
