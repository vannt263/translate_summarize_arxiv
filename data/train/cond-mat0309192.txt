    "the microscopic description of magnetism and metal - insulator transitions constitutes one of the major research activities in modern solid state theory .",
    "for example , transition metal compounds like v@xmath1o@xmath2 , latio@xmath2 , nis@xmath3se@xmath4 or the cuprates show metal - insulator transitions and magnetic order depending on composition , pressure or other control parameters.@xcite one interesting and controversial question concerns the description of the optical properties of these materials,@xcite in particular whether the fundamental physics is governed by the broken translational symmetry e.g.  in the nel state or rather by correlations,@xcite i.e.  the formation of so - called hubbard bands with an energy gap of the order of the relevant coulomb repulsion .",
    "the simplest model showing both magnetism and a correlation induced metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is the one - band hubbard model@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 annihilates ( creates ) an electron at site @xmath7 with spin @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the hopping amplitude between sites @xmath7 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the local coulomb repulsion .",

    "considerable progress in understanding the physics of this simple but nevertheless non - trivial model has been achieved in the last decade through the development of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . in particular , the phase diagram for the hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping is very well understood @xcite .",

    "vertex corrections to the leading particle - hole bubble of the current - current correlation function vanish identically,@xcite i.e.  one needs to calculate the bare bubble only .",
    "this has been extensively used to study the optical conductivity and various other transport properties in the paramagnetic phase of the hubbard model.@xcite on the other hand , up to now a comparable investigation of the optical properties of symmetry broken phases , in particular the nel state at half filling , has not been performed .",
    "however , such an investigation is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , the insulating phase in real materials is in many cases accompanied by magnetic or orbital ordering , typically of the nel type .",
    "to what extent the model ( [ equ : hubbard ] ) can describe the optical properties of ordered insulating phases has up to now not been studied in detail .",
    "second , it is well - known that the restriction of the hubbard model to the paramagnetic state at half filling shows a metal - insulator transition@xcite at a finite critical @xmath15 which is of first order.@xcite it might be argued that for the nel state a similar situation can occur . at small @xmath12 a weak coupling theory",
    "is expected to give accurate results , leading to a band or slater insulator@xcite due to the doubled unit cell in the nel state . at large @xmath12 , on the other hand , the hubbard model is known to reduce to an effective heisenberg model@xcite with localized moments from the onset .",
    "it is an open question whether these two limits are linked continously or via a phase transition at some finite value of the coulomb interaction @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the derivation of an expression for the optical conductivity in the nel state is presented .",
    "the results obtained for the optical conductivity of the hubbard model with nearest neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice at half filling are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "a conclusion and outlook finish the paper in section iv .",
    "in the nel state , the dmft equations have to be modified to account for two inequivalent sublattices @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ fig : ab ] , left panel ) with self - energies @xmath18.@xcite     sublattice decomposition suitable for the treatment of the nel state .",

    "[ fig : ab],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to this end , we introduce operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 which act on sublattice @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . in the case of",
    "nearest - neighbor hopping only , the kinetic part of the hamiltonian ( [ equ : hubbard ] ) can then be written as @xmath21 after fourier transforming this expression we obtain @xmath22 where we introduced the spinors @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the dispersion on the bipartite lattice .",
    "the prime on the sum indicates that the summation is over all values of @xmath25 in the _ magnetic _ brillouin zone ( mbz ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] , right panel ) . within this notation ,",
    "the green function becomes a matrix in the two sublattices , @xmath26 where @xmath27 . from now on we employ the symmetry @xmath28 of the nel state and drop the indices @xmath29 . using this formalism ,",
    "the current operator is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 as usual .",
    "if we consider a lattice for which the conductivity tensor is diagonal , the elements @xmath32 can be calculated from ( @xmath33 is the spatial dimension of the lattice ) @xmath34 with the current - current correlation function @xmath35 again , due to the symmetry of the lattice , the index @xmath36 can be dropped .",
    "the most important simplification arises from the locality of two - particle self - energies within the dmft.@xcite note that in the present formulation the proper locality of the two - particle self - energies is still ensured , because in the dmft as defined by equ .",
    "( [ equ : gfmatrix ] ) no dynamical correlations between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sublattices are introduced . in analogy to the paramagnetic case this allows us to carry out the @xmath25 sums in diagrams containing two - particle self - energy insertions independently at each vertex .",
    "since the single particle propagators only depend on @xmath25 through the even function @xmath24 and the @xmath37 are of odd parity , the sum over their product vanishes . as a result",

    "note that the form ( [ equ : optcond ] ) is reminiscent of the results found in the case of superconductivity , which is discussed at length e.g.  in the book by mahan.@xcite consequently , one can expect to obtain similar features from the evaluation of ( [ equ : optcond ] ) .    in order to proceed with the calculation ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the actual lattice structure and the corresponding non - interacting dispersion in equation ( [ equ : vsqrav ] ) .",
    "for the hypercubic lattice,@xcite @xmath49 is a simple gaussian , and the integration over @xmath50 can be performed analytically . for the details of this calculation see appendix a.",
    "in the following we present results for the optical properties of the hubbard model on a simple hypercubic lattice with nearest neighbor hopping at half filling and @xmath0 in the dmft . the hopping matrix element is chosen as @xmath51 , which ensures the correct scaling of the kinetic energy in the limit @xmath52.@xcite as energy unit it is convenient to use the bandwidth @xmath53 of the system at @xmath54 .",
    "since the gaussian density of states ( dos ) of the simple hypercubic lattice in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions has no real band edges , we take @xmath55 as a reasonable value .",
    "note that for this choice of @xmath53 , ( i ) the spectral weight of the gaussian is exhausted by @xmath56% between @xmath57 and ( ii ) the paramagnetic metal - insulator transition will occur at @xmath58.@xcite the effective quantum impurity model of the dmft is solved using wilson s numerical renormalization group method ( nrg),@xcite suitably extended for dynamical quantities and spin - polarization.@xcite the calculations were performed with a discretization parameter @xmath59 , keeping @xmath60 states .",
    "dynamical quantities were calculated with a gaussian logarithmic broadening of @xmath61 .",
    "occasional checks with @xmath62 states or smaller @xmath63 showed sufficient robustness of the results .      .",
    "the inset shows the magnetization as function of @xmath64 .",
    "[ fig : dosofu],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    before discussing the optical conductivity calculated from ( [ equ : optcond ] ) , it is helpful to review the single particle properties .",
    "the spin resolved one - particle dos calculated at @xmath0 for different values of @xmath12 shows the expected insulating behavior with a clear gap at the fermi energy for all @xmath13 .",
    "in particular for small values of @xmath65 , the dos shows nicely developed nesting singularities at the gap edges , which qualitatively follow the predictions of a weak coupling theory.@xcite with increasing @xmath12 these features get more and more smeared out , and for @xmath66 the spectra resemble those of the mott insulator.@xcite note that the appearance of a gap in the dos is of course accompanied by a vanishing imaginary part of the one - particle self - energy in this region . neither the development of the dos nor the magnetization as a function of @xmath12 shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : dosofu ] provide any evidence as to whether the limits @xmath65 and @xmath66 will be linked smoothly or by some kind of transition .",
    "another interesting quantity is the dynamical magnetic susceptibility , whose low - energy behavior gives further insight into possible differences in spin and charge dynamics . in principle , it is also possible to calculate this quantity as a function of wave vector @xmath67 within the dmft.@xcite however , this requires the calculation of the local irreducible particle - hole self - energy,@xcite which is     for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which shows a well - defined gap @xmath71 as @xmath72 . only the part for @xmath73",
    "note that @xmath71 first increases with increasing @xmath12 , but eventually decreases again.[fig : spingap],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    presently not possible within the nrg .",
    "nevertheless , for the current investigation , a reasonable approximation can be obtained from the local magnetic susceptibility , @xmath74 since the ground state of our system is the nel state , spin excitations require a minimum excitation energy , the spin gap @xmath71 , which conventionally is read off @xmath75 evaluated at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath76 .",
    "however , the gaps at other @xmath67 vectors will be equal to or larger than @xmath71 .",
    "thus , even after summing over all @xmath67-values , the size of the gap in @xmath77 will be determined by @xmath71 . the quantity @xmath77 on the other hand can easily be calculated from the nrg once the dmft has converged .",
    "the results for three typical values of @xmath64 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spingap ] , displaying a nice spin gap @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "evidently , the value of @xmath71 first increases with increasing @xmath12 but then decreases again , as is to be expected from the mapping of the hubbard model to an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with @xmath78 at large @xmath12 . from the calculated @xmath77 one",

    "the results will be discussed below together with the charge gap obtained from the optical conductivity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spin_charge_gap ] ) .",
    "the optical conductivity resulting from the spectra in fig .  [",

    "the inset shows the curves for @xmath68 and @xmath81 using a logarithmic scaling .",
    "[ fig : optcond],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    apparently , the overall behavior seen in the dos has its counter part in @xmath82 . for small values of @xmath12",
    ", one finds a threshold behavior with a singularity , whereas for large @xmath12 the optical conductivity closely resembles the one found in the paramagnetic insulator.@xcite obviously , there are at least two interesting features in @xmath82 .",
    "first , the behavior of @xmath82 in the vicinity of the maximum and second the actual value of the optical gap , i.e.  the energy at which @xmath83 .    in order to address the first point we adopt the following line of reasoning . in the hartree limit ,    , @xmath84 and @xmath85 in ( [ equ : fitfunction ] ) on @xmath12 .",
    "the lines are meant as guides to the eye .",
    "note the rather well defined change in @xmath86 from @xmath87 to @xmath88 around @xmath81 .",
    "[ fig : fitparms],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    i.e.  without an imaginary part of the self - energy , an approximate evaluation of ( [ equ : optcond ] ) yields @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "since this behavior is goverened by square root singularities in the integrand in ( [ equ : optcond ] ) ( see e.g.  the explicit formula derived in the appendix ) , it is reasonable to assume that for a finite imaginary part of the self - energy the above singularity will become an algebraic function @xmath92 with a general exponent @xmath84 .",
    "the quantity @xmath93 approximately cares for the finite imaginary part introduced by the one - particle self - energy and @xmath85 allows for a more complex mixing of real and imaginary parts in the integral ( [ equ : optcond ] ) .",
    "the function ( [ equ : fitfunction ] ) describes the behavior of @xmath82 in the vicinity of the maximum very nicely for all values of @xmath12 ( see dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : optcond ] ) ; note that from the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : optcond ] it is evident that for small @xmath12 this algebraic form has the tendency to overestimate the optical gap , while at large @xmath12 it is clearly underestimated .",
    "let us now turn to the behavior of the parameters @xmath94 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitparms ] . as @xmath95",
    ", we expect that @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , i.e.  @xmath99 .",
    "we indeed find the anticipated square - root singularity ; however , even for small @xmath64 , the value of @xmath94 significantly deviates from the hartree value , being systematically smaller but obviously approaching it as @xmath95 . for values @xmath100 ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath101 is best described by a lorentian , which becomes apparent from the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 obtained in this region , viz @xmath102 and @xmath103 , meaning @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , the results for @xmath94 together with @xmath105 indicate that @xmath106 , in agreement with the predictions of the mott - hubbard picture.@xcite    the behavior of the optical gap @xmath107 ,     ( circles ) , spin gap @xmath71 ( squares ) and double occupancy ( diamonds ) as function of @xmath12 .",
    "the inset shows the gaps scaled with @xmath108 .",
    "dotted lines are meant as guides to the eye . for small @xmath12",
    "both charge and spin gap are identical , while for large @xmath12 we find @xmath109 ( see inset ) and @xmath110 ( full line in main panel).[fig : spin_charge_gap],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    together with the spin gap @xmath71 obtained from @xmath77 and the double occupancy @xmath111 , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_charge_gap ] .",
    "the details of the method used to obtain @xmath107 are discussed in appendix b.    for small @xmath64 , the optical gap is exactly twice as large as the spin gap and , as becomes apparent from the inset , approaches the hartree value @xmath112 as @xmath95 . again _ both _ quantities deviate systematically and by the same amount from the expected hartree values even for the smallest @xmath12 .",
    "thus , even for @xmath113 correlation effects are important and significantly modify the predictions from hartree theory.@xcite for large @xmath12 , on the other hand , we find @xmath114 , consistent with mott - hubbard localized states ; furthermore , @xmath115 as expected from the mean - field theory of the heisenberg model with a @xmath78 .",
    "we find , however , no evidence that the slater limit at @xmath116 and the mott - heisenberg limit at @xmath117 are separated by some kind of phase transition .",
    "all results , including the variation of @xmath111 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_charge_gap ] , rather indicate that a smooth crossover takes place for @xmath118 .",
    "while in the paramagnetic phase of the hubbard model at half filling , when artificially extended to @xmath0 , a true phase transition from a correlated metal to a mott - hubbard insulator at @xmath119 has been established , the situation in the physically more relevant nel state has not been investigated in similar detail up to now . as a first step into this direction the properties in the ground state of the hubbard model at half filling with particle - hole symmetry have been discussed .",
    "we did confirm that the physical properties at small and large values of the coulomb parameter @xmath12 can be well described within a slater and mott - heisenberg picture , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the paramagnetic mott - hubbard mit we could not find any solid evidence for a similar transition in the nel state ; our data rather suggest a smooth crossover , which occurs at a value @xmath120 .",
    "even the double occupancy , which in the case of the paramagnetic mit is an indicator of a phase transition , does not show any sign of an anomaly here .",
    "a novel quantity we discussed was the spin gap , which we extracted from the local transverse spin susceptibility .",
    "the general behavior and size agree very well with exactly known limits .",
    "this shows that at least in cases where a well defined spin gap exists that becomes minimal at special points in the brillouin zone , even the inspection of purely local dynamical susceptibilities can be sufficient .",
    "there are , however , still several unanswered questions .",
    "first , the analytic form of the optical conductivity close to the optical gap and the precise value of this gap could not be obtained at present due to numerical problems when evaluating the integral ( [ equ : optcond ] ) . especially for a more quantitative comparison with experiment",
    "this has to be improved in future work .",
    "second , comparison with the data for v@xmath1o@xmath2 from ref .",
    "( circles and left scale ) and full optical gap @xmath121 ( squares and right scale ) vs. @xmath64 .",
    "the open circle and square with errorbars represent values for the scaled kinetic energy and @xmath121 respectively , extracted from ref .   for the sample of v@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath122k .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath124.[fig : h_kin],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    show a nice agreement for the kinetic energy ( obtained using the optical sum rule ) , but fail completely concerning the size of the optical gap .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_kin ] , where we plot the kinetic energy scaled to its value for @xmath54 ( circles and left scale ) and @xmath121 ( squares and right scale ) vs.  @xmath64 . the open circle and square represent data for the kinetic energy and charge gap , respectively , extracted from ref .   for a v@xmath1o@xmath2 sample with @xmath122k .",
    "obviously , with the present model , one largely overestimates the optical gap at intermediate values of @xmath12 .",
    "of course the present investigation did concentrate on the simplest situation , viz a system with perfect particle - hole symmetry . in reality ,",
    "electron hopping beyond nearest neighbors will destroy antiferromagnetism at small values of @xmath12 and consequently lead to different gaps at intermediate values of @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gaps at large @xmath12 are controlled by mott - hubbard physics and will most likely change only little . a similar line of argument has in fact been invoked in ref .  , too .",
    "a recent study of the properties of the magnetically frustrated hubbard model indicates that this scenario is indeed very likely.@xcite evidently , a further detailed investigation of the optical properties in the nel state , in particular with more realistic band structures , is necessary and surely highly interesting .",
    "work along this line is in progress .",
    "we acknowledge useful conversations with d.  vollhardt , t.p .",
    "deveraux , g.  uhrig , m.  potthoff , s.  kehrein and r.  bulla .",
    "this work was supported by the dfg through the collaborative research center sfb 484 , the leibniz computer center and the computer center of the max - planck - gesellschaft in garching .",
    "in this appendix we present details of the further evaluation of the energy integrals in equation ( [ equ : optcond ] ) for the hypercubic lattice in the limit @xmath52 . in that case",
    "the density of states becomes a gaussian , i.e.  we need to calculate the two integrals @xmath125 and @xmath126 it is now convenient to split up the spectral functions into two parts , i.e.@xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 as defined after equ .",
    "( [ equ : gfmatrix ] ) . in the same way we write @xmath130",
    "where now @xmath131 using this notation and collecting equivalent terms , it can easily be verified that the following four integrals need to be evaluated : @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 and @xmath135 the further evaluation will be demonstrated for the first term . using the notation @xmath136 we may write @xmath137 \\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bar above a term denotes complex conjugation .",

    "the remaining three contributions can be obtained in a similar fashion . finally ,",
    "combining complex conjugate expressions , we arrive at the following result for the four integrals : @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 where we have introduced @xmath148 a further analytical evaluation of the remaining integration over @xmath149 in equation ( [ equ : optcond ] ) using eqs .",

    "while the definition of the optical gap is straight forward , the extraction of numbers from the numerical data appears to be rather problematic for two simple reasons .",
    "first , the spectra calculated with nrg have an unavoidable intrinsic broadening , which becomes especially severe for the hubbard bands at larger values of @xmath64 .",
    "second , as @xmath153 , the imaginary part of the one - particle self - energy becomes negligible , and the singular structure of the integrand ( [ eq : i3 ] )  ( [ eq : i2 ] ) entering into ( [ equ : optcond ] ) makes additional broadening necessary to allow for a stable numerical integration .",
    "together both effects very efficiently mask the true @xmath154-dependence close to the optical gap , in particular for larger @xmath64 .    in order to nevertheless have an unambiguous working procedure that allows to extract a reasonable approximation to the true optical gap from our numerical data , we _ postulate _ that @xmath155 for @xmath154 in the region where ( [ equ : fitfunction ] ) starts to deviate substantially from the data and _ choose _ a minimal @xmath84 such that it produces a reasonable fit _ for all values of @xmath12 _ ( see fig .

    "fig : lowwfit ] for selected results ) .",
    "we find @xmath156@xcite and an optical gap @xmath107 which is consistent with the spin gap @xmath71 as @xmath95 .",
    "the good agreement of these two differently calculated quantities ( see inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : spin_charge_gap ] ) also serves as an a posteriori check for the procedure used to determine @xmath107 . in view of a possible comparison to experimental results@xcite",
    "this situation is , of course , not satisfying .",
    "for this purpose a more thorough and possibly analytical evaluation of @xmath82 close to @xmath107 would be desirable .",
    "unfortunately , the complicated form of the integrals in ( [ equ : optcond ] ) so far have allowed for an analytical evaluation only in the hartree limit .",
