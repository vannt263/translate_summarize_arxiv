    "the detection of the @xmath6 second neutrino pulse from supernova 1987a , observations of its blue giant progenitor and of the subsequent electromagnetic signals have contributed a great deal to our understanding of supernova physics .",
    "conversely new physics manifesting via neutrinos or new theoretically motivated particles is strongly constrained by these observations .",
    "a path to many such constraints utilizes the fact that various stars do not suffer excessive energy losses via the production and emission of these new particles .",
    "as shown by many authors ( for a review and references , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , such considerations are particularly strong when we consider the very hot and dense core of the supernovae . due to its high nuclear density ,",
    "the core can , in the standard model ( sm ) , cool only via emission of neutrinos .",
    "the collapse energy of a core of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 km is approximately @xmath9 erg @xmath10 mev .",
    "the collapse heats up the core to a high temperature and generates a large flux of neutrinos of all six types ( including neutrinos and antineutrinos ) of average energy o(@xmath11 mev ) .",
    "calculation of the mean free path for neutrino collisions suggests that the neutrinos will be trapped for a while in the core before diffusing out and the resulting neutrino emission based cooling is then expected to last for a few seconds .",
    "the approximately twenty neutrinos observed from supernova 1987a  @xcite confirm the expected pulse duration , it s energy spectrum and overall intensity .",
    "hypothetical weakly coupled particles can  for not too weak a coupling to electrons and nucleons  be amply produced in the hot core and more readily escape , depleting the neutrino pulse and shortening its duration .",
    "this will contradict observations and thereby exclude significant domains of couplings of particles such as axions , kk recurrences of light particles , right handed neutrinos , super - light gravitinos etc , which can be thermally produced in the core and escape , for a wide range of masses and couplings . in this paper , we focus on the dark photon @xmath0 associated with a hidden @xmath12 , which has been widely discussed in the literature in connection with attempts to understand the dark matter of the universe  @xcite .",
    "these particles arise also in a class of particle physics models known as mirror models discussed in connection with neutrino physics as well as dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the dark photon is very weakly coupled to the sm particles and also expected to be light .",
    "therefore , supernova observations should provide useful constraints on the properties of this particle .    in general dark photon models ,",
    "gauge invariance allows a mixing of type @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the antisymmetric tensor made out of the sm @xmath15 gauge boson and @xmath16 is the corresponding one for the @xmath12 gauge field associated with the @xmath0 .",
    "the primary channel through which @xmath0 couples to sm particles is through the kinetic mixing with photon with strength parameter @xmath5 given above .",
    "in the simple @xmath12 extensions of sm , @xmath5 is an arbitrary parameter , but in the context of a grand unified or other non - abelian embedding of either the sm or @xmath12 , where , at the tree level , @xmath17 , any super - heavy `` @xmath18 '' particles that carry both the sm @xmath15 and @xmath12 charges , can generate kinetic mixing @xmath19 at one or higher loop level .",
    "the mixing is then proportional to @xmath20 and varies only logarithmically with the mass ratio @xmath21 with @xmath22 tev to mev the mass scales in the sm .",
    "thus if @xmath12 is eventually unified with the sm gauge interactions , then we will have @xmath23 and @xmath24 might be expected .",
    "however @xmath12 may have very small @xmath25 charges leading to much smaller mixing , @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider a broad range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in considering constraints on this new particle .",
    "recent laboratory experiments have indeed already eliminated a wide range of @xmath4 for @xmath26 or so . for smaller mixings ,",
    "astrophysical observations such as from the supernova can be used and general energy loss arguments sketched above do indeed imply that @xmath27 for @xmath28 mev or so  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : constraint ] ) . in this note",
    "we focus on the impact of subsequent decay of the @xmath0 on observations and discuss bounds from them on the @xmath29 plane . for most of the paper",
    ", we will treat the @xmath0 on it s own as a particle with a mass @xmath4 and a mixing @xmath5 with the photon .",
    "the @xmath0 produced in the supernova can decay to @xmath1 or @xmath30 s depending on its mass .",
    "we will see that these decays will help to strengthen the bounds on @xmath5 can arise from consideration of the effect of @xmath0 decays on big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "these bounds arise in a different mass range of the dark photon and are complementary to our results . ] .",
    "the boundaries of the region in the @xmath29 plane excluded by the energy loss argument correspond to situations where the dark photons carry out of the core a sizable fraction of the huge collapse energy @xmath31 ergs .",
    "our main point is that if some fraction of this energy also manifests electro - magnetically , then the signature would be hard to miss .",
    "the fact that the optical , uv , x - ray etc signatures started only @xmath32 3 hours after the collapse with the expected light - curve magnitudes and durations , extends further the disallowed @xmath29 regions .",
    "some of the arguments here are similar to those used in deriving limits on radiative decays of neutrinos from the supernova leaving the progenitor star  @xcite or the axion - photon conversion in the strong external fields @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we discuss preliminaries on the production and decays of the dark photon ; in sec . 3 , we consider the constraints when the @xmath0 decays outside the core but before it reaches the surface of the progenitor ; in sec . 4",
    ", we discuss the same for the case when the @xmath0 decays to @xmath1 in the vicinity of the progenitor star , namely at distances between @xmath33 ( the radius of the star ) and @xmath34 ; in sec . 5 , we discuss the case with dark photon mass below @xmath3 and the resulting constraints on @xmath5 for this kinematic range .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the production of the dark photon in the supernova core and its decay properties .      in the supernova core ,",
    "the dominate production process of the dark photons are the nucleon bremsstrahlung scattering @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with the dark photon coupled to proton via the kinetic mixing @xmath37 . following closely ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the energy emission rate of dark photon per unit volume from both the two bremsstrahlung processes , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the phase space of the five incoming and outing particles , @xmath40 symmetry factor , @xmath41 scattering amplitudes , @xmath42 the non - relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distributions of the two incoming nucleons in the non - degenerate limit .",
    "see the appendices in ref .",
    "@xcite for the calculation procedure and details . after some straightforward simplification , we find that , compared to @xmath43 , the @xmath44 scattering process is highly suppressed by the ratio @xmath45 ( @xmath46 being the momentum transferred in the @xmath47 scattering ) , the symmetry factor @xmath40 and powers of the nucleon - pion coupling ratio @xmath48 , thus in the calculation below we consider only the former one , with the energy emission rate expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the pion - nucleon coupling , @xmath51 the electric charge , @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 the masses of nucleon and pion , @xmath55 and @xmath56 mev the baryon density and temperature in the supernova core , @xmath57 dimensionless parameters relating the masses , momenta and temperature in the scattering processes .",

    "is solely determined by the dark photon mass @xmath4 . to obtain the luminosity due to the dark photon emissions , we have to integrate over the whole volume of the supernova core @xmath59 , assuming simply the production rate is a constant within the core @xmath60 km . for a decaying dark photon , we have to include the decaying factor @xmath61 $ ] in the integral , which depends both on the mixing and mass parameters .",
    "we would also like to mention that when calculating the number emission rate per unit volume , the explicit factor @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : qa1 ] ) should be removed , @xmath63 in obtaining the following constraints , the equations  ( [ eqn : qa1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : na ] ) are the basics for the `` exact '' numerical calculations , with the decaying factor being also a crucial factor .    for our discussion below",
    ", we will take the total number of dark photons to be such that it carries away energy less than the luminosity corresponding to neutrinos . as a rather rough estimation",
    ", this corresponds to the value @xmath64 with each @xmath0 having an average energy of @xmath65 mev . from the fact that the total energy loss is @xmath66 ergs",

    "<S> the hypothetical massive dark photon ( @xmath0 ) which has kinetic mixing with the sm photon can decay electromagnetically to @xmath1 pairs if its mass @xmath2 exceeds @xmath3 and otherwise into three sm photons . </S>",
    "<S> these decays yield cosmological and supernovae associated signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss these signatures , particularly in connection with the supernova sn1987a and delineate the extra constraints that may then arise on the mass and mixing parameter of the dark photon . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that for dark photon mass @xmath4 in the 5 - 20 mev range , arguments based on supernova 1987a observations lead to a bound on @xmath5 which is about 300 times stronger than the presently existing bounds based on energy loss arguments . </S>"
