    "convection plays an important and well - known role in the transport of energy in stellar interiors .",
    "it has also been argued that convection is important in a number of low - density astrophysical plasmas , such as the intracluster medium in clusters of galaxies ( chandran & rasera 2007 ) and accretion flows onto compact objects ( quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "although convection in stellar interiors has been thoroughly studied over the course of several decades , the theory of convection in low - density plasmas is still being developed , and investigations carried out during the last several years have led to some interesting surprises .",
    "for many years , it was widely assumed that the convective stability criterion for a low - density , non - rotating , weakly magnetized plasma is the schwarzchild criterion , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the specific entropy of the plasma and the gravitational acceleration is in the  @xmath3 direction .",
    "however , balbus  ( 2000 , 2001 ) showed that even weak magnetic fields strongly modify the convective stability criterion by causing heat to be conducted almost exclusively along magnetic field lines .",
    "this anisotropy in the thermal conductivity arises when the electron gyroradius is much less than the electron mean free path , a condition that is easily satisfied for realistic magnetic fields in most cases of interest .",
    "balbus considered an equilibrium in which the magnetic field is in the  @xmath13-plane , and in which @xmath14 , where @xmath1 is the pressure and  @xmath2 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "he showed that near marginal stability , the temperature of a rising fluid parcel is almost constant , essentially for two reasons .",
    "first , the parcel remains magnetically connected to material at its initial height .",
    "second , near marginal stability a fluid parcel rises very slowly , so thermal conduction has enough time to approximately equalize the temperature along the perturbed magnetic field lines . as a result ,",
    "the stability criterion becomes  @xmath15 .",
    "when this criterion is satisfied , a rising fluid parcel is cooler than its surroundings , and hence denser at the same pressure , so that it falls back down to its initial height .",
    "parrish & stone ( 2005 , 2007 ) carried out numerical simulations that validated balbus analysis and extended it to the nonlinear regime .",
    "an immediate question arises , namely , why does nt balbus s stability criterion apply to stars ?",
    "although stellar plasmas are magnetized , heat is conducted in stellar interiors primarily by photons . as discussed by balbus ( 2000 , 2001 ) ,",
    "the conductivity is thus almost isotropic , so it is the schwarzchild criterion that applies .",
    "the reason that the schwarzchild criterion applies even if the isotropic conductivity is large is somewhat subtle .",
    "if @xmath16 , then adiabatic expansion would cause a slowly rising fluid parcel to be hotter and lighter than its surroundings , and hence buoyant .",
    "the effect of isotropic conductivity is then to relax the temperature in the parcel towards that of the immediately surrounding fluid .",
    "however , because the conductivity is finite , the rising fluid parcel s temperature is never decreased all the way to the temperature of its surroundings .",
    "the fluid parcel thus remains slightly hotter than its surroundings , and hence slightly lighter at the same pressure , and the fluid is convectively unstable .",
    "although isotropic conductivity does not modify the schwarzchild stability criterion , it does reduce the convective heat flux and the `` efficiency of convection '' in a convectively unstable fluid by decreasing the temperature difference @xmath17 between rising fluid parcels and their surroundings ( cox & guili 1968 ) .",
    "balbus s analysis has been extended in two ways by recent studies .",
    "first , chandran & dennis ( 2006 ) , ( hereafter referred to as [ cd06 ] ) , investigated how the stability criterion is affected by the presence of cosmic rays that diffuse primarily along magnetic field lines .",
    "like balbus ( 2000 , 2001 ) , they assumed that  @xmath18 and took the equilibrium magnetic field to be in the  @xmath13-plane they showed that near marginal stability , the cosmic - ray pressure is nearly constant within a rising fluid element .",
    "this is because the fluid element remains connected to material at its initial height , and because fluid elements rise very slowly near marginal stability , so that there is plenty of time for cosmic - ray diffusion to approximately equalize the cosmic - ray pressure  @xmath9 along the perturbed magnetic field lines .",
    "[ cd06 ]  showed analytically that the stability criterion in the presence of cosmic rays is @xmath19 , where @xmath8 is the total number density of thermal particles .",
    "more recently , quataert ( 2007 ) considered buoyancy instabilities in a low - density , high-@xmath20 plasma in the absence of cosmic rays , but allowing the equilibrium magnetic field to have a component in the  @xmath21 direction , parallel or antiparallel to the direction of gravity .",
    "since the temperature is a function of  @xmath21 , the @xmath21 component of the equilibrium magnetic field leads to an equilibrium heat flux .",
    "quataert ( 2007 ) showed that this heat flux causes the plasma to become convectively unstable even if  @xmath15 , so that the plasma is always convectively unstable if the magnetic field has a nonzero @xmath21 component and a nonzero component in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "this heat - flux - buoyancy instability arises because of the geometry of the perturbed magnetic field lines in the plasma .",
    "for example , when the magnetic field is in the  @xmath21 direction and a fluid element is displaced upwards at a 45-degree angle with respect to the @xmath21 axis , field lines converge as they enter the fluid element from `` above '' ( i.e. , from larger  @xmath21 ) . as a result , if @xmath15 then the parallel heat flux converges within the fluid element , causing the fluid element to become hotter than its surroundings , and thus less dense at the same pressure .",
    "buoyancy forces then cause the upwardly displaced fluid element to rise unstably .",
    "( quataert  2007 ) the nonlinear development of this instability was investigated numerically by parrish & quataert ( 2007 ) .",
    "one of the open questions in this area of research is whether the buoyancy instabilities identified in these previous studies for the  @xmath18 regime still operate when the magnetic field strength is increased to the point that  @xmath22 .",
    "we address this question in this paper .",
    "we consider the equilibrium geometry investigated by balbus ( 2000 , 2001 ) and [ cd06 ] , in which the magnetic field is in the  @xmath13-plane - in particular , we set @xmath23 .",
    "we also allow for cosmic rays that diffuse along magnetic field lines , but now we allow  @xmath20 to take any value .",
    "we focus on wave vectors in the `` quasi - interchange '' limit , in which @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , where  @xmath27 is the density scale height .",
    "this is the most unstable wave - vector regime for stratified adiabatic plasmas , because a small  @xmath28 reduces the stabilizing effects of magnetic tension and a large  @xmath29 allows a rising fluid element to easily get out of the way of the next rising element beneath it by moving just a small distance in the  @xmath30 direction .",
    "( parker 1967 , shu 1974 , ferrire et al . 1999 ) we show analytically that the stability criterion in this limit is @xmath31 and we present a heuristic derivation of this stability criterion from physical arguments . we also derive approximate analytical solutions to the dispersion relation for small - amplitude perturbations to the equilibrium in different parameter regimes , and compare these solutions to numerical solutions of the full dispersion relation .",
    "our results are important for determining the convective stability of galaxy - cluster plasmas , in which cosmic - rays are often produced by central radio sources .",
    "convection in intracluster plasmas is of interest because it may provide a mechanism for regulating the temperature profiles of galaxy - cluster plasmas and offsetting radiative cooling , thereby solving the so - called `` cooling - flow problem . ''",
    "( chandran 2004 , 2005 ; parrish & stone 2005 , 2007 ; chandran & rasera 2007 ) .",
    "our results are also important for determining the conditions under which the parker instability can operate in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "previous treatments of the parker instability assume an adiabatic thermal plasma ( parker 1966 , 1967 , shu 1974 , ryu 2003 ) .",
    "our results show that anisotropic thermal conductivity makes the ism more unstable to the parker instability , so that the instability can operate under a wider range of equilibrium profiles than was previously recognized .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : disprel ] we outline the derivation of the general form of the dispersion relation . in section",
    "[ sec : qil ] we specialize to the quasi - interchange limit , present our derivation of the necessary and sufficient condition for convective stability , and describe the properties of the unstable eigenmodes in plasmas that are very close to marginal stability . in section  [ sec : physical ] we present a heuristic , physical derivation of the stability criterion .",
    "we discuss the implications of our work for galaxy - cluster plasmas and the interstellar medium in sections  [ sec : gc ] and  [ sec : parker ] , respectively . in section  [ sec : conc ] we summarize our results , and in appendix  [ ap : eigenmodes ] we present approximate analytic solutions and numerical solutions to the dispersion relation .",
    "we begin with a standard set of two - fluid equations ( drury & volk 1981 , jones  &  kang 1990 ) , which we modify to include thermal conduction along the magnetic field : @xmath32 ,                                      \\\\ \\label{eq : pcosmic } \\frac{d{p_{\\rm cr}}}{dt}&= & -{\\gamma_{\\rm cr}}{p_{\\rm cr}}{\\nabla}\\cdot{\\mathbf v}+{\\nabla}\\cdot \\left [   { \\hat { \\mathbf b}}{d_\\parallel}\\left (    { \\hat { \\mathbf b}}\\cdot{\\nabla}{p_{\\rm cr}}\\right ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , and where @xmath34 is the plasma mass density , @xmath35 is the velocity , @xmath36 is the plasma pressure , @xmath37 is the cosmic - ray pressure , @xmath38 is the ratio of specific heats of the plasma , @xmath39 is the effective ratio of specific heats for the cosmic rays , @xmath40 is the magnetic field , @xmath41 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath42 is the thermal conductivity along the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath43 is the cosmic - ray diffusivity along the direction of the magnetic field , and @xmath44 is the gravitational acceleration . we have ignored cross - field conduction and diffusion in equations  ( [ eq : pgas ] )  and  ( [ eq : pcosmic ] ) since the gyroradii of the thermal particles are small compared to their coulomb mean free path , and the gyroradii of the cosmic rays are small compared to the mean free path for cosmic - ray scattering .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : masscon])@xmath45([eq : pcosmic ] ) are closed via the equation of state for an ideal gas : @xmath46 we take @xmath47 and consider an equilibrium in which @xmath48 all equilibrium quantities ( denoted with a `` 0 '' subscript ) are taken to be functions of @xmath21 only , and we set @xmath49 .",
    "these assumptions lead to a condition for hydrostatic equilibrium of the form : @xmath50 to introduce perturbations , we represent the variables in our two - fluid equations as sums of an equilibrium value and a small fluctuating quantity as follows : @xmath51 we employ a local analysis , in which we take the fluctuating quantities to be proportional to @xmath52 , with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the density scale height , which we take to be comparable to the length scales over which each of the equilibrium quantities varies . substituting equations ( [ eq : rhoperturb ] ) and ( [ eq : pgasperturb ] ) , and analogous expressions for @xmath37 , @xmath40 , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , and @xmath7 into equations  ( [ eq : masscon])@xmath45([eq : pcosmic ] ) , and into equation  ( [ eq : eqstate ] ) ,",

    "it is worthwhile to note that in the absence of cosmic rays and thermal conductivity , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the adiabatic sound speed , and that if we take this limit , together with the limit of no stratification and @xmath77 , the general dispersion relation reduces to the well - known dispersion relation obtained in ideal mhd .",

    "this solution satisfies the approximate equation @xmath155 making use of the fact that  @xmath156 for this mode , we can return to the results of section  [ sec : disprel ] ( in particular , the equation @xmath157 ) and show that to leading order in  @xmath158 @xmath159 and @xmath160 so that @xmath161 thus , for modes with @xmath162 near marginal stability , most of the compression or expansion of the plasma occurs in the direction of the magnetic field rather than perpendicular to the magnetic field , despite the fact that  @xmath28 is very small .",
    "we discuss the importance of this result further in the next section .",
    "in this section , we present a way of understanding the stability criterion in equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit0 ] ) in physical terms .",
    "we consider the same equilibrium discussed in section  [ sec : disprel ] , in which  @xmath163 and @xmath23 , and we again take the plasma to be perfectly conducting , so that magnetic field lines are frozen - in to the fluid .",
    "however , we now assume that the equilibrium is very close to marginal stability .",
    "we then imagine some mode in the plasma that causes a long and narrow magnetic flux tube to rise upwards , as depicted in figure  [ fig : f1 ] . for simplicity , we assume that the ends of the flux tube are anchored at the flux tube s initial height .",
    "we take the flux tube to be very long , so that magnetic tension forces are very weak . because the medium is arbitrarily close to marginal stability ,",
    "the growth time or oscillation time for the mode is arbitrarily long .",
    "thus , even though the flux tube is long , there is plenty of time for conduction and diffusion to equalize  @xmath7 and @xmath9 along the perturbed magnetic field lines .",
    "we assume that the total pressure , @xmath164 , at each point along the flux tube is equal to the total pressure just outside the flux tube at that point .",
    "[ cd06 ] , and we assume they are stable here as well . however , we note that socrates , parrish , & stone ( 2007 ) have shown that magnetosonic waves can become unstable in the presence of an equilibrium heat flux , when @xmath106 . ]    , width=240 ]    we define @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively , as the difference between the density , temperature , field - strength - squared , and cosmic - ray pressure at the highest point in our flux tube and the immediately surrounding medium , at a point in time when the top of the flux tube is a small distance  @xmath169 above the flux tube s initial height .",
    "the constancy of  @xmath7 and @xmath9 along the flux tube yields the relations ( accurate to first - order in  @xmath170 ) @xmath171 and @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the gradients of the equilibrium temperature and cosmic - ray pressure evaluated at the initial height of the flux tube .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : dt1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dpcr1 ] ) tell us how to evaluate @xmath7 and @xmath9 in our flux tube . evaluating @xmath175 in the flux tube is a little more involved . assuming that the total pressure decreases with height , the fluid in the flux tube has to expand in order to achieve total - pressure balance .",
    "however , the manner in which the flux tube expands is not obvious .",
    "if the plasma expands primarily along the magnetic field , the cross sectional area of the flux tube will be constant along the flux tube , and thus so will the magnetic field strength .",
    "on the other hand , if the plasma expands perpendicular to the field , the magnetic field strength will decrease .",
    "which type of expansion does the plasma favor ?",
    "we answer this question analytically in section  [ sec : ems ] , where we show that , near marginal stability , @xmath176 for the low - frequency long - parallel - wavelength buoyancy instability in the large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "thus , for this mode , most of the expansion @xmath177 arises from the parallel motion .",
    "we note that this statement is stronger than the statement that @xmath178 , because we take @xmath24",

    "one way is by analogy to the @xmath179 analysis of the stability of ideal mhd plasmas , in the absence of thermal conduction .",
    "( bernstein , frieman , kruskal , & kulsrud 1958 , friedberg  1987 ) in this analysis , it is shown that if a mode expands in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , additional work must be done on the surrounding magnetic field .",
    "this requirement makes the mode more stable . to find the stability criterion , we must seek out the most unstable mode , which in this case is a mode that keeps the cross - sectional area of the flux tube constant .    taking the cross - sectional area of the flux tube to be constant ,",
    "we can treat @xmath175 as constant along the flux tube .",

    "in many galaxy - cluster cores , the radiative cooling time is much shorter than the cluster s likely age ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "nevertheless , high - spectral - resolution x - ray observations show that very little plasma actually cools to low temperatures .",

    "this finding , sometimes referred to as the `` cooling - flow problem , '' strongly suggests that plasma heating approximately balances radiative cooling in cluster cores .",
    "a heating mechanism for cluster cores that has been studied extensively is heating by a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the importance of such `` agn feedback '' is suggested by the observation that almost all clusters with strongly cooling cores possess active central radio sources ( burns 1990 ; ball , burns , & loken 1993 ; eilek  2004 ) and by the correlation between the x - ray luminosity from within a cluster s cooling radius and the mechanical luminosity of a cluster s central agn ( brzan et al 2004 ,  eilek 2004 ) .",
    "one of the main unsolved problems regarding agn feedback is to understand how agn power is transferred to the diffuse ambient plasma .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been investigated , including compton heating ( binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ; ciotti , ostriker , & pellegrini  2004 , sazonov et al 2005 ) , shocks ( tabor & binney 1993 , binney & tabor 1995 ) , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave - mediated plasma heating by cosmic rays ( bhringer & morfill  1988 ; rosner & tucker  1989 ; loewenstein , zweibel , & begelman  1991 ) , and cosmic - ray bubbles produced by the central agn ( churazov et al  2001 , 2002 ; reynolds 2002 ; brggen  2003 ; reynolds et  al  2005 ) , which can heat intracluster plasma by generating turbulence ( loewenstein & fabian 1990 , churazov et  al  2004 , cattaneo & teyssier 2007 ) and sound waves ( fabian et  al  2003 ; ruszkowski , brggen , & begelman 2004a , b ) and by doing @xmath183 work ( begelman 2001 , 2002 ; ruszkowski & begelman  2002 ; hoeft & brggen  2004 ) .",
    "another way in which central agns may heat the intracluster medium is by accelerating cosmic rays that mix with the intracluster plasma and cause the intracluster medium to become convectively unstable . a steady - state ,",
    "spherically symmetric , mixing - length model based on this idea was developed by chandran ( 2004 ) and subsequently refined by chandran ( 2005 ) and chandran & rasera ( 2007 ) . in this model , a central supermassive black hole accretes hot intracluster plasma at the bondi rate , and converts a small fraction of the accreted rest - mass energy into cosmic rays that are accelerated by shocks within some distance  @xmath184 of the center of the cluster .",
    "the resulting cosmic - ray pressure gradient leads to convection , which in turn heats the thermal plasma in the cluster core by advecting internal energy inwards and allowing the cosmic rays to do  @xmath183 work on the thermal plasma .",
    "the model also includes thermal conduction , cosmic - ray diffusion , and radiative cooling . by adjusting a single parameter in the model ( @xmath184 ) ,",

    "the parker instability is an unstable mode in a gravitationally stratified plasma that is driven by the buoyancy of the magnetic field and/or cosmic rays .",
    "( parker 1966 , 1967 ) the parker instability is thought to be important for the interstellar medium for several reasons .",
    "it has been argued that this mode , acting alone or in concert with the thermal instability ( field 1965 ) , contributes to the formation of molecular clouds ( blitz & shu 1980 ; parker & jokipii 2000 ; kosinski & hanasz 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ) .",

    "results for this mode are presented for the unstable quasi - isothermal buoyancy mode in the top row of figure [ fig : f2 ] for the cases @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",

    "the mode is always damped .",
    "this result is just the generalization to the case of arbitrary @xmath20 of the diffusive mode referred to in section 4.2 of [ cd06 ] .    for the isothermal buoyancy mode we set @xmath338 in equation ( [ eq : swaveexp ] ) and substitute into equation  ( [ eq : nodimbspwl ] ) again .",

    "once again we compare our approximate analytical solutions to the solutions obtained numerically from equation  ( [ eq : gendisp ] ) for a set of parameters chosen to ensure that the solutions presented fall within the bounds of the short - parallel - wavelength limit . as before we present two examples of the unstable ( isothermal buoyancy ) mode ; one for the case @xmath308 , and one for the case @xmath309 .",
    "these are shown in the bottom row of figure [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "for each mode , the location of the critical wave number @xmath247 is marked with a vertical line .",
    "it is again seen that within the limits of validity of our analytical expressions , ( @xmath343 ) , the approximate results and numerical results are in good agreement .",

    "finally we note that for both cases , the range of unstable wavelengths is the same as for the long - parallel - wavelength limit while , in the @xmath308 case , the maximum growth rate occurs for @xmath344 where we find @xmath345 , whereas for the @xmath309 case we find @xmath346 and @xmath347 . here",
    "again we observe the importance of the magnetic field in determining both the rate of growth and the range of unstable wave numbers .",
    "comparing these results to those in section [ sec : numcomplong ] , we also note that high rates of diffusivity lead to growth rates several times larger than when these rates are low .",
    "in this appendix we show that the general dispersion relation given by equation  ( [ eq : gendisp ] ) reduces properly to the results obtained by parker ( 1966 , 1967 ) and shu ( 1974 ) when these results are restricted to the short - wavelength approximation ( @xmath348 ) assumed throughout this paper . in the limit considered by these authors ,",
    "cosmic - ray diffusivity is taken to be infinite and thermal conduction vanishes , whence @xmath349 , and @xmath350 .",
    "taking these limits in equation ( [ eq : gendisp ] ) and once again neglecting the terms involving @xmath351 , our dispersion relation reduces to @xmath352 where the coefficients are now @xmath353 , \\hspace{0.3cm}\\mbox{and}\\label{eq : ccoffour}\\\\ c_6 & = & { \\omega_{\\rm s}^2}{\\omega_{\\rm a}^2}\\left[\\left({\\gamma}-1\\right){\\omega_0 ^ 2}+{\\gamma}{\\mathcal c}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : ccofsix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we compare this result to the expression obtained by shu ( 1974 ) in the limit of no rotation and no shear which is given by equation ( 53 ) of that paper .",
    "to do this we must take account of the differences in notation , the fact that shu s expression is given in dimensionless form , and most importantly that given the global equilibrium assumed in shu ( 1974 ) , the scale height , @xmath27 , in that paper is consistent with our definition of @xmath27 given by equation ( [ eq : defh ] ) .",
    "it is also important to note that shu s perturbations include a multiplicative `` envelope '' function which is an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath21 above the origin . to account for this the quantity `` @xmath354 '' as defined in shu ( 1974 ) must be set to zero . with all of these requirements",

    "\\label{eq : pscofsix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath357 , the terms in equations ( [ eq : pscoffour ] ) and ( [ eq : pscofsix ] ) that involve the factor @xmath358 must be neglected in the short - wavelength limit .",
    "additionally , the term in equation ( [ eq : pscoftwo ] ) involving @xmath359 can be seen to be small compared to @xmath81 as follows : @xmath360 and similarly , the term in equation ( [ eq : pscoffour ] ) involving @xmath361 can be seen to be small by comparison to @xmath362 according to : @xmath363 where the second - to - last relation uses the fact that @xmath364 .",
    "thus the terms by which the coefficients @xmath365 of shu ( 1974 ) differ from the coefficients @xmath366 obtained from our general dispersion relation in the parker / shu limit and given by equations ( [ eq : ccofzero])@xmath45([eq : ccoffour ] ) , are just those that must be neglected in the short - wavelength limit to which we have restricted ourselves in this paper , so that in this limit the results we have obtained match those of shu ( 1974 ) .",
    "we can informally recover the necessary and sufficient condition for stability in this limit by applying the method of dominant balance ( bender & orszag , 1978 ) which we have described in appendix [ ap : eigenmodes ] , to the dispersion relation given by equation ( [ eq : pslim ] ) with the quantity @xmath81 used to scale the solutions , and with the quantities @xmath367 and @xmath89 taken to be small compared to @xmath81 . thus to lowest - order",
    "we find that solutions , @xmath153 to equation ( [ eq : pslim ] ) that are of order @xmath81 satisfy : @xmath368 the discriminant of this expression can be expressed in positive definite form as @xmath369 and one can see by inspection of equation ( [ eq : ccoftwo ] ) that @xmath370 is also a positive - definite quantity .",
    "thus the solutions , @xmath371 are always real and negative , and the modes of order @xmath372 are always stable .    the potentially unstable modes @xmath373 can be found by seeking solutions to equation ( [ eq : pslim ] ) that satisfy @xmath374 where @xmath375 , while continuing to assume that @xmath367 and @xmath89 are also small compared to @xmath81 .",
