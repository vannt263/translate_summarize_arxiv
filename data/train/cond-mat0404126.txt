    "in the last few years graph theoretic approach has been of great value to characterize complex systems found in social , informational and biological areas . here",
    ", a complex system is represented as a graph or network whose vertices and edges stand for its constituents and interactions .",
    "a simplest model for such is the random graph model proposed by erds and rnyi ( er )  @xcite . in the er model , @xmath0 number of vertices",
    "are present from the beginning and edges are added one by one in the system , connecting pairs of vertices selected randomly . due to the randomness , the distribution of the number of edges incident on each vertex , called the degree distribution , is poissonian .",
    "however , many real - world networks such as the world - wide web , the internet , the coauthorship , the protein interaction networks and so on display power - law behaviors in the degree distribution .",
    "such networks are called scale - free ( sf ) networks  @xcite .",
    "thanks to recent extensive studies of sf networks , various properties of sf network structures have been uncovered  @xcite .",
    "there have been a few attempts to describe scale - free networks in the framework of equilibrium statistical physics , even though the number of vertices grows with time in many real - world networks  @xcite . in this approach , various mathematical tools developed in equilibrium statistical physics",
    "may be used to understand network structures . to proceed , one needs to define equilibrium network ensembles with appropriate weights , where one graph corresponds to one state of the ensemble . in a canonical ensemble ,",
    "the number of edges @xmath11 is fixed : given a degree distribution , @xmath12 , the mean degree @xmath13 is obtained .",
    "then the number of edges obtained through the relation , @xmath14 , can be fixed .",
    "a degree sequence specifies the number of vertices with degree @xmath15 as @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "a grandcanonical ensemble can be also defined , where the number of edges is also a fluctuating variable while keeping the sf nature of the degree distributions . the grandcanonical ensemble for sf random graphs",
    "is realized in the static model introduced by goh _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite or in its generalized version investigated in refs .",
    "the name ` static ' originates from the fact that the number of vertices is fixed from the beginning . here",
    "each vertex @xmath1 has a prescribed weight @xmath2 summed to 1 and an edge can connect vertices @xmath1 and @xmath3 with rate @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a chemical potential - like parameter @xmath17 that can be regarded as  time \" in the process of attaching edges controls the mean number of edges so that @xmath18 increases with increasing @xmath17 .    as the parameter @xmath17 increases , a giant cluster , or giant component , forms in the system .",
    "here the giant cluster means the largest cluster of connected vertices whose size is @xmath19 .",
    "often such a giant cluster appears at the percolation transition point . in equilibrium",
    "statistical physics , the percolation problem can be studied through a spin model , the @xmath6-state potts model in the @xmath5-limit  @xcite . using the relation , in this paper , we study the evolution of sf random graphs from the perspective of equilibrium statistical physics . to be specific ,",
    "we construct the @xmath6-state potts model , where the interaction strength between each pair of vertices is inhomogeneous on the complete graph . in this formulation , since the interaction strength @xmath17 is tunable , the mean number of edges @xmath20 varies .",
    "thus , the grandcanonical ensemble is taken in the network representation .",
    "however , since the number of spins ( vertices ) is fixed , the formulation corresponds to a canonical ensemble in the spin - model representation .",
    "note that our model is different from the one studied by dorogovtsev _",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite where the potts model is defined as a given fixed network so that each edge represents homogeneous interactions .",
    "the formulation of the spin model facilitates explicit derivation of various properties of the sf network .",
    "thus we derive the formula for the giant cluster size , the mean cluster size , and in particular , the number of loops and clusters .",
    "these quantities are explicitly evaluated analytically for the static model with @xmath21 , @xmath22 in the thermodynamic limit as a function of the edge density , and their critical properties are also studied .",
    "the degree exponent @xmath23 is related to @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , their finite - size scaling behaviors are obtained using the _ finite _ largest cluster size for finite @xmath0 that in turn is evaluated from the cluster size distribution . from these , we are able to elucidate the process of formation of the giant cluster . while for the case @xmath9 , the giant cluster forms abruptly at the percolation transition point @xmath26 , for the case @xmath27 where most real world networks belong to , however , the formation of the giant cluster is gradual and the mean cluster size for finite @xmath0 show double peaks .",
    "in fact , the percolation problem of sf networks has been studied , but in a different way , that is , by removing vertices one by one as well as their attached edges from an existing sf network  @xcite .",
    "the percolation transition was understood by using the branching process approach , which is supposed to be valid near the percolation transition point , where the network is sparse . in this paper",
    ", we provide the criterion for the validity of the branching process approach for a general degree distribution , and show that the branching process and the potts model approaches are equivalent for the static model . finally , note that while the branching process approach can not count the number of loops , the potts model formalism we use here enables us to count it .",
