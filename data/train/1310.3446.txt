    "heegaard floer theory is a set of invariants for closed , connected 3-manifolds and cobordisms between them , with a related invariant for closed 4-manifolds @xcite .",

    "the maps associated to cobordisms arise from a similar construction , which uses heegaard triples to represent certain elementary cobordisms @xcite .",
    "+ in 2008 , lipshitz , ozsvth and thurston @xcite developed bordered heegaard floer homology , which generalizes @xmath15 to parametrized riemann surfaces and to bordered 3-manifolds , meaning 3-manifolds with parametrized boundary . given two such 3-manifolds @xmath16 and @xmath17 , if the surfaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 have compatible parametrizations , then the bordered heegaard floer invariants for @xmath16 and @xmath17 may be combined to obtain @xmath9 , where @xmath6 is the 3-manifold defined by identifying the boundaries of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "+ specifically , to a parametrized surface @xmath20 , there is an associated differential graded algebra @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath18 is identified with @xmath20 and @xmath19 with @xmath22 , then the bordered invariant for @xmath16 is a right @xmath23 module @xmath24 over @xmath21 , while the invariant for @xmath17 is a left differential graded module with an additional `` type d '' structure over @xmath21 , called @xmath25 .",
    "lipshitz , ozsvth and thurston define the tensor product @xmath26 , which is a simple model for the @xmath23 tensor product .",
    "they then demonstrate that the resulting chain complex is quasi - isomorphic to the closed invariant @xmath9 .",
    "+ given such a decomposition of a closed 3-manifold @xmath27 , we may represent @xmath6 by a heegaard diagram @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are subsurfaces of @xmath31 with disjoint interiors , each @xmath11 curve is contained entirely in either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , and @xmath32 is the union of all gradient flow lines of the morse function that pass through @xmath33 , for each @xmath34 .",
    "the marked surfaces @xmath29 and @xmath30 are called bordered heegaard diagrams for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and they contain the data needed to define @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "+ in each case , the generators are the tuples of intersection points of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 curves in @xmath33 which extend to generators of @xmath35 , while the differential and products involve counting rigid holomorphic curves .",
    "however , in order to rebuild the closed invariant from these pieces , the algebra @xmath21 and the modules @xmath24 and @xmath25 must encode information about how such curves interact with the boundary @xmath36 . to accomplish this , the generators of @xmath21 are `` strand diagrams '' representing ways that rigid holomorphic curves may intersect @xmath36 , while the relations in @xmath21 represent ways that the ends of one - dimensional moduli spaces of holomorphic curves may behave near this boundary .",
    "+ in the @xmath23 module @xmath37 , the products record the behavior of holomorphic curves that hit the boundary in certain prescribed ways , with rigid curves that intersect the boundary more times contributing to higher products .",
    "the type @xmath38 structure on @xmath39 consists of a differential and an identification between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 vector space whose generators are the same as those of @xmath39 , with this data satisfying certain properties .",
    "+ lipshitz , ozsvth and thurston also defined a bordered invariant for cobordisms between parametrized surfaces @xcite .",
    "this is a bimodule , called @xmath0 , which incorporates both the type d structure and the @xmath23 structures of the modules @xmath39 and @xmath37 .",
    "bimodules with this structure are called type @xmath43 bimodules .",
    "+ the bimodule @xmath0 is defined for 3-dimensional cobordisms in general , but in particular we may consider mapping cylinders of surface diffeomorphisms , meaning 3-manifolds diffeomorphic to a product @xmath44 $ ] with the boundary components parametrized , and with a marked , framed section over @xmath45 $ ] which allows us to compare the two parametrizations .",
    "this yields a functor from the mapping class groupoid to the category of differential graded algebras , with morphisms given by type @xmath43 bimodules .",
    "+ we may construct a 2-category from the mapping class groupoid by taking certain lefschetz fibrations over rectangles as 2-morphisms .",
    "the main result of this paper is that these cobordisms induce type @xmath43 maps between the @xmath0 invariants of mapping cylinders , and that this data forms a 2-functor .",
    "+ specifically , the 2-morphisms we use are  cornered lefschetz fibrations , \" or clf s .",

    "the left and right edges are identified with @xmath46 for some parametrized surfaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , while the top and bottom edges are identified with mapping cylinders , so the resulting parametrizations of the corners coincide .",
    "this lefschetz fibration is also equipped with a marked framed section , which corresponds to the marked sections on the edges . with this definition understood",
    ", we have the following theorem :    given a cornered lefschetz fibration between two mapping cylinders @xmath49 and @xmath50 , there is an induced type da bimodule map from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "this map is well - defined up to chain homotopy .    to define a cobordism map associated to a clf with a single critical point ,",
    "we first construct a bordered heegaard triple which represents this lefschetz fibration . to accomplish this",
    ", we consider the vanishing cycle as a knot in the mapping cylinder identified with the bottom edge , and build a genus @xmath53 bordered heegaard diagram for this mapping cylinder subordinate to that knot , where @xmath7 is the genus of the fiber .",
    "we then define an additional set of curves , obtaining a heegaard triple which represents the cobordism induced by the appropriate surgery .",
    "+ the cobordism map is defined by counting rigid holomorphic triangles associated with this heegaard triple .",
    "the higher maps and type @xmath38 structure maps encode the ways that these triangles interact with the right and left boundaries of the heegaard surface , respectively . +",
    "more generally , we may associate a cobordism map to any clf , by decomposing this lefschetz fibration into pieces by a sequence of horizontal and vertical cuts . given two clf s @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with the right edge of @xmath54 and the left edge of @xmath55 equipped with compatible parametrizations , we may define their horizontal composition @xmath56 by identifying these edges .",
    "if @xmath57 is a cobordism between the mapping cylinders @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and we have maps @xmath60 associated to each @xmath57 , then there is an induced type @xmath43 bimodule map : @xmath61    similarly , if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are clf s where @xmath62 is a cobordism from @xmath49 to @xmath7 and @xmath63 is a cobordism from @xmath7 to @xmath64 , then we may define the vertical composition @xmath65 by identifying the top edge of @xmath62 with the bottom edge of @xmath63",
    ". given maps between the appropriate bimodules associated to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we may associate the composition of these maps to the vertical composition of @xmath62 and  @xmath63 . + to prove that the homotopy class of maps associated to a clf with multiple critical points does not depend on the decomposition",
    ", we will show that horizontal decompositions may be altered to form vertical decompositions , and vice versa .",
    "this flexibility allows us to show that hurwitz moves do not change the class of the map , and also allows us to rearrange a description of a given lefschetz fibration in order to facilitate the calculation of the invariant .",
    "in this section we will review the concepts of @xmath23 modules , type @xmath38 modules , and type @xmath43 bimodules , working exclusively over @xmath42 .",
    "this material is covered in greater detail in section 2 of @xcite , and section 2 of @xcite .      given a differential graded algebra @xmath66 with differential @xmath67 , a right @xmath23 module over @xmath66",

    "we will define type @xmath43 bimodules over @xmath23 algebras , noting that these definitions reduce to those of analogous structures over dga s .",

    "this differential arises from the relationships between the products @xmath81 and the maps @xmath108 for particular generators , namely :    @xmath113      given @xmath23 algebras @xmath114 and @xmath115 , a type @xmath43 bimodule over @xmath114 and @xmath115 is an object which behaves as an @xmath23 module over @xmath115 and a type @xmath38 module over @xmath114 ( see section 2.2.4 of @xcite ) .",

    "therefore the corresponding triangles in @xmath29 must be rigid .",
    "a count of the dimensions of the triangles in @xmath30 shows that the analogous disks must be rigid as well .",
    "+ now we may prove the following :    given a decomposition of a clf with a single critical point , the homotopy class of the induced type da map does not depend on the decomposition .",
    "we may relax our initial assumptions , and allow the mapping cylinders @xmath280 and @xmath426 to differ .",
    "we may decompose @xmath395 as @xmath427 , where @xmath428 and @xmath429 , and then express @xmath297 as @xmath430 , where @xmath431 .",
    "this decomposition satisfies our previous assumptions , and so the map induced by the decomposition is homotopic to @xmath344 .",
    "the invariance result for clf s with no critical points , along with lemma 1 , show that the map induced by @xmath432 is homotopic to @xmath344 as well .",
    "this decomposition also satisfies our initial assumptions , and so @xmath4 and @xmath344 are homotopic .",
    "+ the case of a horizontal decomposition @xmath394 where @xmath395 is trivial and @xmath396 has a single critical point is similar ; while the formula for @xmath175 is different , the underlying geometric argument is essentially the same .",
    "+      ( horizontal versus vertical ) let @xmath297 be a clf with at least two critical points , expressed as a composition of clf s each with a single critical point , and let @xmath4 be the type @xmath43 map induced by this decomposition .",
    "then there is a purely horizontal decomposition of @xmath297 which induces the same map up to homotopy .",
    "proof : it suffices to show that any individual vertical composition may be removed or replaced with a horizontal composition , without altering the homotopy class of the resulting type @xmath43 map . with that in mind ,",
    "assume that @xmath297 is expressed as a vertical composition @xmath433 , where the clf @xmath54 has initial mapping cylinder @xmath49 and resulting mapping cylinder @xmath50 , and @xmath55 has initial mapping cylinder @xmath50 and resulting mapping cylinder @xmath434 .",
    "+        we will argue that the composition @xmath435 , which induces a type @xmath43 map from @xmath436 to @xmath437 , yields the same map as @xmath433 up to homotopy ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "first , note that @xmath54 and @xmath438 induce homotopic maps , as do @xmath55 and @xmath439 .",
    "the latter may be decomposed as @xmath440 , and by the invariance result for clf s with no critical points , this change does not alter the homotopy class of the induced map .",
    "+ next , we may apply lemma 2.2 to show that the map induced by @xmath441 is homotopic to the map induced by @xmath442    by lemma 2.1 , this map is homotopic to that induced by @xmath435 , as desired .",
    "we have now demonstrated that any decomposition of a clf may be replaced with a purely horizontal decomposition , without altering the homotopy class of the induced map .",
    "it remains to show that any two horizontal decompositions of the same clf induce homotopic maps .",
    "+ given such a horizontal decomposition , there is an ordering of the critical points from  left \" to  right \" , according to where they occur in the decomposition .",
    "if two horizontal decompositions of the same clf result in the same ordering of critical points , then we may construct a common refinement of these decompositions . since horizontal compositions of type @xmath43 maps are associative up to homotopy , we may use the invariance result for clf s with a single critical point to show that these two compositions induce homotopic maps .",
    "+ now we will show that two horizontal decompositions of the same clf induce the same map up to homotopy , even if they order the critical points differently .",
    "it is sufficient to treat the case in which these orderings differ by a transposition .",
    "let @xmath297 and @xmath377 be two clf s each with a single critical point , which may be composed horizontally as @xmath443 .",
    "we may express @xmath297 as an abstract clf with @xmath444 , and @xmath377 as an abstract clf with @xmath445 .",
    "+        if @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the initial mapping cylinders of @xmath297 and @xmath377 , respectively , then we may decompose @xmath297 as @xmath446 and @xmath377 as @xmath447 , where @xmath396 and @xmath448 are clf s each with a single critical point , both from the identity to a dehn twist .",
    "it then suffices to show the following :    ( hurwitz move ) there is an alternate horizontal decomposition of @xmath449 , which induces the same map up to homotopy , and which reverses the ordering of the two critical points .",
    "let @xmath450 and @xmath451 be the resulting mapping cylinders of @xmath396 and @xmath448 , respectively .",
    "then we may decompose @xmath396 as @xmath452 , and @xmath448 as @xmath453 . by applying lemma 2.2",
    ", we can then show that @xmath449 induces the same map , up to homotopy , as @xmath454 .",
    "+ by lemma 2.1 , this map is homotopic to the map induced by :    @xmath455    however , the clf @xmath456 is equivalent to a clf @xmath457 , with one critical point , from the identity function to the dehn twist @xmath458 . by another application of lemma 2.2 ,",
    "the map induced by @xmath449 is thus homotopy equivalent to the map induced by @xmath459 .",
    "these two clf s differ by a hurwitz move , which preserves the symplectic structure but reverses the order of the two critical points .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 5.1 .",
    "for each genus @xmath7 the mapping class groupoid of genus @xmath7 may be extended to a 2-category , by taking cornered lefschetz fibrations to be the 2-morphisms .",
    "we may also consider the 2-category whose objects are differential graded algebras , with 1-morphisms given by quasi - isomorphism classes of type @xmath43 bimodules , and 2-morphisms given by chain homotopy classes of type @xmath43 morphisms . with this in mind",
    ", we have the following theorem :    the bordered invariants for surfaces and mapping cylinders , along with the maps induced by clf s , comprise a 2-functor .",
    "this is almost directly a consequence of the invariance result , as we will see .",
    "+ recall that , given 2-categories @xmath460 and @xmath461 , a 2-functor @xmath462 consists of the following data :    1 .",
    "for each object @xmath306 in @xmath460 , an object @xmath463 in @xmath461 .",
    "2 .   for each morphism @xmath464 in @xmath460 , a morphism @xmath465 in @xmath461 .",
    "3 .   for each 2-morphism @xmath466 in @xmath460 , a 2-morphism @xmath467 in @xmath461 .    this data must satisfy :    1 .",
    "@xmath4 preserves identity morphisms and 2-morphisms .",
    "this means that for every object @xmath306 in @xmath460 we have @xmath468 , and for every morphism @xmath49 in @xmath460 we have @xmath469 .",
    "2 .   @xmath4 preserves composition of morphisms , so @xmath470 , for any composable morphisms @xmath471 and @xmath472 in @xmath460 .",
    "@xmath4 preserves both horizontal and vertical composition of 2-morphisms .",
    "this means that , given morphisms @xmath473 and @xmath474 in @xmath460 , and 2-morphisms @xmath475 , we have that @xmath476 .",
    "furthermore , given a morphism @xmath477 and a 2-morphism @xmath478 , we also have that @xmath479    in our case , the 2-functor @xmath4 takes a parametrized surface @xmath480 to the dga @xmath481 , a mapping cylinder @xmath482 to the type @xmath43 bimodule @xmath404 over @xmath483 and @xmath484 , and a clf @xmath297 between mapping cylinders @xmath49 and @xmath7 to the induced map @xmath485 .",
    "all of these associations are up to quasi - isomorphism and chain homotopy , and so @xmath4 is well - defined .",
    "+ @xcite demonstrated that the bimodule @xmath486 over two copies of @xmath481 is quasi - isomorphic to @xmath481 as a type @xmath43 bimodule over itself .",
    "we have seen that the map induced by a trivial heegaard triple for a clf with no critical points is equal to the identity map on the appropriate bimodule , and so we can see that @xmath4 satisfies the first criterion . @xcite",
    "have also shown that the bimodules @xmath487 and @xmath488 are quasi - isomorphic , and so @xmath4 meets the second criterion as well .",
    "+ to see that @xmath4 preserves both types of composition of 2-morphisms , note that we defined @xmath489 to be the map induced by any horizontal or vertical decomposition of @xmath297 , and then showed that the choice of decomposition does nt matter .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath4 is a 2-functor , proving theorem 6.1 .",
    "given a clf @xmath297 with @xmath87 critical points and fibers of genus @xmath7 , we may express @xmath297 as a horizontal composition of the following form :    @xmath490    where @xmath491 is any given clf with a single critical point and genus @xmath7 fibers .",
    "+ this shows that , in order to calculate the map associated to any clf with fibers of genus @xmath7 , it suffices to know the bimodules associated to mapping cylinders of that genus , and the map associated to a single clf @xmath491 . @xcite",
    "have shown that we may calculate @xmath404 for any mapping cylinder @xmath49 provided that we have a decomposition of @xmath49 into arc slides .",
    "thus the calculation of the map associated to a single clf with one critical point in each genus would provide the remaining necessary piece .",
    "broken fibrations are a natural generalization of lefschetz fibrations , in which we allow for smooth one - dimensional families of singular fibers , as well as the usual isolated singular fibers , and in which the genus of the fibers difers by one on either side of such a family .",
    "while lefschetz fibrations are necessarily symplectic , any smooth 4-manifold may be represented by a broken fibration @xcite . by defining cobordism maps associated to broken fibrations",
    ", it should be possible to generalize the results of this thesis to obtain a full 2 + 1 + 1 tqft . + this problem is tractable because broken fibrations , like lefschetz fibrations , may be decomposed into elementary pieces .",
    "one of these pieces is a trivial cobordism between a certain 3-manifold @xmath6 and itself . here",
    "@xmath6 is any cobordism between a parametrized genus @xmath7 surface and a parametrized genus @xmath492 or @xmath493 surface , provided that @xmath6 arises from adding a one - handle or two - handle , respectively .",
    "+ the other new elementary pieces are 4-manifolds with corners that come from adding one - handles and three - handles .",
    "the appropriate cobordism maps for such pieces are analogous to the maps @xcite developed for one - handle and three - handle additions between closed 3-manifolds . + once these components are in place , one can attempt to prove that the resulting maps associated to general cobordisms with corners do not depend on the choice of decomposition .",
    "lekili @xcite developed a collection of moves for modifying broken fibrations without altering their smooth structures , and williams @xcite proved that these moves are sufficient to relate any two mutually homotopic broken fibrations which represent the same 4-manifold .",
