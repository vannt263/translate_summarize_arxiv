    "the dna molecule is a double - stranded biopolymer with two complementary sugar - phosphate chains ( backbones ) twisted around each other forming a right handed helix @xcite .",
    "each chain is a linear polynucleotide consisting of four kinds of bases : adenine , guanine ( purines ) and cytosine , thymine ( pyrimidines ) .",
    "the two chains are joined together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of nucleotides , a - t with two hydrogen bonds and g - c with three hydrogen bonds . at sufficiently high temperature , the double stranded dna ( dsdna ) helix melts and the molecules",
    "separate into two single strands ( ssdna ) .",
    "the experimental procedure consists in preparing a set of dsdna with the same length and sequences , which are immersed in an aqueous solution with given physiological conditions .",
    "then the fraction of broken base pairs as a function of temperature , referred to as the melting curve , is measured by the @xmath0 light absorption , typically at about @xmath1 .",
    "long dna molecules give rise to steps in the melting curves corresponding to different regions melting at different temperatures whereas synthetic oligonucleotides do not show any multistep behavior ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this denaturation process , often interpreted as a reminiscent of a discontinuous first order phase transition , has attracted a great deal of interest to study the physics of highly nonlinear biomolecular system and also it has led to several micromanipulation experiments @xcite . from biophysics point of view",
    ", the strand separation is a key aspect of dna transcription and replication @xcite . during transcription , a transient bubble of ssdna",
    "is formed to allow the enzyme that makes a rna copy of the dna sequence to access the dna bases . during replication that occurs during cell division for example , the dsdna separates into two , each strand then serving as a template for the synthesis of a new dsdna . on",
    "the otherhand , accurate prediction of dnas thermal denaturation is an important parameter for many biological techniques like polymerases chain reaction ( pcr ) where dsdna are routinely converted to separated ssdnas by melting at elevated temperature .",
    "therefore , the study of dna denaturation which is an important biological phenomena has become a subject of interdisciplinary interest .",
    "the early theoretical models like poland - scheraga ( ps ) type @xcite considers the dna molecule as being composed of an alternating sequence of bound and denaturated ( loop or bubble ) states . typically , a bound state is energetically favored over an unbound one while a denaturated segment is entropically favored over a bound one .",
    "the dna denaturation can be viewed as a competition between the entropy of the denaturated loops and the bound state energy of the sequence . in ps type models ,",
    "the segments that compose the chain are assumed to be noninteracting with each other .",
    "this assumption considerably simplifies the calculation of free energy . in the past",
    ", the entropy of the denaturated loops has been evaluated by modeling them either as ideal random walks @xcite or as self avoiding walks @xcite .",
    "it has been found that within this approach the denaturation transition of dna is continuous both in two and three dimensions , and it becomes first order only for @xmath2 .",
    "a denaturated segment in between two bounded structures may introduce flexibility , allowing neighboring segments to interact with the bubble and with each other .",
    "inclusion of this excluded volume interaction effect in ps model drives the transition first order even for @xmath3 ( and above ) @xcite . in a different approach , peyrard and bishop ( pb )",
    "@xcite proposed a microscopic model to describe the dynamics of the dna denaturation by introducing an interaction potential which depends on the transverse stretching of the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs .",
    "an improved version of this pb model with more realistic treatment of the backbone stiffness @xcite yields what appears to be a first order phase transition . despite the simple formalism",
    ", the pb model has successfully reproduced the essential features of thermally induced denaturation of long dna chains .",
    "it has been used to estimate the melting curves of very short heterogeneous dna segments , in excellent quantitative agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "it also provides the characteristic multistep melting behavior observed in heterogeneous dna sequence @xcite .",
    "recently , this model has been used to investigate charge transport properties in dna chain @xcite and the role of nonlinearity and entropy provided by the local base pairs on the interaction of the dna transcription @xcite .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the uv absorption of the spectroscopic measurements are interpreted as the yield for the average fraction of the open base pairs .",
    "the denaturation process leads to a sharp transition from dsdna to ssdna when the sequence is long . for short oligomers ,",
    "this transition is not sharp enough . due to finite size effect , two fractions ,",
    "fully dissociated molecules ( @xmath4 ) due to opening of all the base pairs spontaneously and partially melted intermediate states ( @xmath5 ) , may co - exist over a wide range of temperature below the melting point . from the spectroscopic measurements , it is not possible to estimate these two fractions separately .",
    "recently , a new method has been proposed @xcite to quantify the presence of intermediate states and fully open molecules by combining the uv spectroscopy with the quenching technique .",
    "the sequences which are partially self - complementary are prepared in the duplex form by hybridizing with the exact reverse complement . on heating",
    ", the duplex either melts spontaneously into two separate single strands or remains as connected but with many broken base pairs .",
    "molecules which are completely open form hairpins on quenching while the molecules which are partially open close again as duplexes .",
    "the relative amount of hairpins give the fraction @xmath4 of completely open molecules whereas the uv spectroscopic measurements yield the fraction of total open base pairs @xmath6 .",
    "the difference @xmath7 represents the fraction of partially melted intermediate states .",
    "this method has yielded new data on the fraction of @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 and also the relative average bubble size @xmath8 as a function of temperatures in the melting transition of several dna oligomers @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we try to understand this new and exciting experimental data both qualitatively and quantitatively within the frame work of pb formalism which has been quite successful elsewhere .",
    "we avoid the rigorous solution of the transfer integral ( ti ) equation to evaluate the configurational partition function . instead , we concentrate on yet simple but well approximated ti integral which yields a schrodinger like second order differential equation . for simplicity ,",
    "we use morse potential @xcite with inclusion of anharmonic stacking interaction @xcite .",
    "we propose here that for the spontaneous melting of the dsdna leading to a complete strand separation , the molecules are required to overcome an effective barrier through thermally assisted tunneling whereas the fraction of partially melted intermediate states can be explained on the basis of the bound state solution of the effective potential in the temperature range for which the bound state exists .",
    "the excellent agreement of this prediction with experiments @xcite provides strong justification for the proposed formalism .",
    "since the spontaneous melting probability is considered as the tunneling phenomena , there exists a mid point temperature at which the thermal energy becomes equal to the height of the entropic barrier .",
    "this aspect has been utilized further to derive a simple but an important relation between the double strand stiffness parameter and the mid point temperature which can be determined experimentally .",
    "it is shown that the height and the width of the derivative of the double strand separation probability with respect to temperature depend strongly on the parameters of the entropic barrier and thus , can be used as the experimental tool to learn more about the nature of the stacking interaction .",
    "the details of the pb model with various improvements have been described elsewhere @xcite and also we have mentioned it briefly in the appendix for completeness .",
    "what concerns here in the present study is the partition function of the configurational part given by    z_y= _ - ^ _",
    "i=1^n dy_n  e^-h(y_n , y_n-1 ) , [ mzy ]    where the constant @xmath9 having the dimension of length has been introduced to make @xmath10 dimensionless .",

    "the first term represents the stacking interaction potential between adjacent base pairs with a @xmath16dependent stiffness constant @xmath17 .",
    "the morse potential ( second term ) describes the interaction of the base pairs in the two complementary strands .",
    "the parameters of the model , the depth @xmath18 and the spatial range @xmath19 , distinguish between the a - t and g - c base pairs .",
    "the integral eq.([mzy ] ) can be evaluated in the thermodynamic limit using the eigen values and eigen functions of a transfer integral ( ti ) operator @xcite    dy_n-1   e^-h(y_n , y_n-1 )   ( y_n-1 ) =  e^-   ( y_n ) .",
    "[ mti ]    it yields @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lowest eigen value of a schrodinger type equation    - + v(y ) ( y)= ( + s_0 )   ( y ) , [ sch1 ]    where    @xmath22    [ meigen ]    as expected , the constant @xmath9 does not affect the final expression for @xmath10 or the free energy per site @xmath23 .",
    "however , as will be shown later , it is an important and useful parameter of the present formalism which affects the thermal activation energy @xmath24 and also it is required to make the ti equation ( [ mti ] ) dimensionally consistent .",
    "it may be mentioned here that the full partition function that contains all the factors including the kinetic terms is dimensionless due to the phase space factor @xmath25 in the denominator .",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath26 in ( [ mzy ] ) can be considered as the part of the phase space distance associated with only the configurational part of the partition function whose value can be fixed by comparing the results with the experimental measurements .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is assumed of the form @xmath27 $ ] so that @xmath17 decreases from @xmath28 to @xmath29 at large @xmath30 .",
    "it is now possible to separate @xmath24 into two parts : a @xmath16dependent positive term which gives an entropic barrier when added to the morse potential and a @xmath16independent thermal part @xmath31 , although both parts depend on temperature .",
    "accordingly , eq.([sch1 ] ) can be rearranged to give    - + v_eff(y ) ( y)= ( + _ th )   ( y ) , [ sch2 ]    where v_eff(y)=+  ln , and _ th = ln ( ) .",
    "[ eth ]    in the pb model , a y - dependent stiffness with an exponential form @xmath32 was used to reflect the fact that the dna is significantly more rigid in the double - stranded conformation than when either of the two interacting base pairs is stretched .",
    "although there is no theoretical guideline , a value of @xmath33 was used in @xcite to simulate the melting curves of short heterogeneous dna sequences ( which accounts for total yield @xmath6 ) . however , in this study , we have felt the need to use a very small value of @xmath34 in order to explain the spontaneous melting fraction of the fully dissociated molecules and partially open intermediate states simultaneously for many oligomers .",
    "a small value of @xmath34 would mean a flat entropic barrier over a large distance .",
    "although it is very much essential for @xmath35 to decrease from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , the rate of decrease is not found fast enough unless the stretching exceeds a particular limit which may be due to the strong backbone support it receives from the neighboring base pairs while in the double stranded conformation .",
    "this could be interpreted as some type of co - operative phenomena involving several base pairs with a range larger than what is normally expected . to simulate this effect",
    ", we use a slightly different form of wood - saxon type    = ,    characterized by the depth @xmath36 , range @xmath38 and diffuseness parameter @xmath34 .",
    "these are the co - operativity parameters and , in general , may depend on the sequence composition , length of the sequence and also on the buffer conditions .",
    "since it is not known how to fix , these are considered as free parameters to be fixed by the experimental observations .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical plot of the effective potential @xmath39 as a function of @xmath30 at a temperature of @xmath40 .",
    "the potential parameters are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for exponential dependence @xmath34",
    "is taken as @xmath45 whereas for wood - saxon form , @xmath38 and @xmath34 are chosen as @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively ( as an example ) .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the case when the y - dependence is ignored . as can be seen from the figure , although both the exponential and the wood - saxon forms lead to the same physical consequence , namely , a decrease of the backbone stiffness from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , qualitatively , both give rise to two different forms of entropic barriers .",
    "we have studied both the forms and prefer to retain the wood - saxon form which is found to be more suitable to explain the melting behavior of several oligomers .",
    "in the following , we describe the method to characterize the fraction of fully open molecules @xmath4 and partially melted intermediate states @xmath5 .",
    "a dsdna corformation is thermodynamically stable when the free energy per base pair @xmath48 . on the otherhand , for ssdna , @xmath49 .",
    "the bound state solution of the morse potential with the entropic contribution with inclusion of both harmonic and anharmonic stacking interaction has been studied in the past . for long dna sequence ,",
    "the denaturation begins with formation of bubbles due to local meltings of different domains ( local openings of base pairs ) where the base pair bindings are relatively weak .",
    "when the average bubble size attains a critical value at temperature close to the melting point @xmath50 , the entropy gain becomes sufficient to overcome the binding and the entire sequence separates into two single strands discontinuously .",
    "therefore , it is only at @xmath51 , a real separation is expected . however , for shorter sequences as in the case of many synthetic oligomers , the complete strand separation may occur even below the melting temperature and the melting process may proceed with the co - existence of both fully dissociated molecules ( @xmath4 ) and partially melted intermediate states ( @xmath5 ) over a wide range of temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is noticed that the short oligomers ( @xmath52 bp ) melt suddenly and the melting curve can be represented by a two state model in which the molecules are either completely closed or completely open . as the oligomer size increases , zipper model seems to be more appropriate which opens continuously giving rise to partially open intermediate states @xcite .",
    "many synthetic oligomers which are clamped at both the ends by the relatively gc rich base pairs may nucleate from the middle at region continuosly until a limiting bubble size is reached after which the melting becomes discontinuos or even depending on the sequence composition , the melting may have contributions from both the processes simultaneously .",
    "it is also noticed that the oligomers which are open at one end behave differently than when both the end points are fixed .",
    "therefore , the new experimental measurements with different oligomer designs now impose additional constraints on the theoretical models which are required to explain both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( hence @xmath6 ) simultaneously .",
    "moreover , a quantitative understanding of the melting process of different synthetic oligomers will be a stepforward in gaining more insight of the process by which the base pairs open up locally in a real dna sequence even at room temperature . in this work ,",
    "we propose thermally assisted barrier penetration phenomena as a new mechanism for complete strand separation whereas the partially opened intermediate states are interpreted as the bound state solutions of the same effective potential that generates a barrier .",
    "these are two distinct processes below the melting temperature although this distinction vanishes as the temperature is raised up to a limit above which the bound state no longer exists . below the melting temperature , small amplitude coherent fluctuations which involves several base pairs",
    "may drive a dsdna out of the potential well into the continuum for which @xmath49 .",
    "although thermodynamically favorable to remain separated , these conformations are still in the dsdna state ( small amplitude fluctuations around the equilibrium value @xmath53 ) and are required to overcome an entropic barrier ( to the right ) in order to remain as stable ssdna conformation .",
    "the fraction @xmath4 , thus , amounts to calculating the thermally assisted tunneling probability through an entropic barrier with energy @xmath54 as given by ( [ eth ] ) where we have set the free energy @xmath55 .",
    "the probability of tunneling can be obtained by solving the schrodinger eq.([sch2 ] ) using wkb approximation    p=(1+e^2s ) ^-1 , with the action integral    s=_y_1^y_2 ^1/2 dy . [ p1 ]    note that the term @xmath56 is the quantum analog of @xmath57 .",
    "when the thermal energy @xmath54 becomes greater than the barrier height @xmath58 , the potential barrier can be approximated by an inverted parabola , allowing the use of the analytic expression of hill and wheeler @xcite    p= ^-1 , [ p2 ] with = ^1/2 , evaluated at the barrier position @xmath59 .",
    "now , using ( [ p1 ] ) for @xmath60 and ( [ p2 ] ) for @xmath61 , the ssdna fraction @xmath4 as a function of @xmath62 can be estimated . for the intermediate states",
    ", we estimate the quantity    = n _ y_min^y_max |_0(y)|^2  dy , [ sig ]    where @xmath63 is a normalization constant and @xmath64 is the ground state eigen function of the effective potential @xmath65 for temperature @xmath66 .",
    "the integral is bounded by two limits whose values are very crucial to reproduce the experimental observation of the peak to valley ratio of the partially melted intermediate states @xcite . in general , @xmath67 so that the nucleating bubble gains sufficient entropy to grow whereas @xmath68 defines a range upto which the entropic barrier exists .",
    "it may be mentioned here that we do not include the contribution of @xmath64 beyond @xmath68 although @xmath64 is still nonvanishing particularly when @xmath62 approaches @xmath69 . at such high temperature ,",
    "the ground state energy becomes quite close to the continuum and the melting may proceed with opening of all the remaining base pairs suddenly .",
    "therefore , the fraction of @xmath64 beyond @xmath68 only contributes to the sudden opening which has been already included in eq.([p2 ] ) for @xmath70 .",
    "as will be shown later , the experimental data supports a long entropic barrier with range @xmath71 . since we are interested for @xmath64 in the range @xmath72 , where the entropic barrier remains practically constant , the ground state solution of the morse potential with a constant stiffness @xmath73    _",
    "0(y)= exp(-d e^-ay ) exp[(d-)a y ] .",
    "[ phi ]    can be used to estimate @xmath5 ( as a good approximation ) .",
    "it is well known that a sharp melting transition can not be understood only on the basis of the ground state solution of morse potential with a constant stiffness unless a y - dependent stacking interaction is included . in the present formalism , the above desired effect is already included in the total yield @xmath6 which is now the sum of @xmath5 obtained with a constant stiffness as part of the bound state solution and @xmath4 which is the tunneling probability through a dynamically generated entropic barrier that includes stiffness variation .    now using the above formalism",
    ", we have estimated both the fraction @xmath4 and @xmath5 for two synthetic oligomers l60b36 and l42b18 which are studied experimentally in ref@xcite .",
    "both the oligomers are clamped at the ends with identical gc pairs and with an at rich middle region of variable lengths ( l60b36 : length l= 60 bases , bubble forming region b=36 bases , l42b18 : l=42 bases , b=18 bases ) .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the estimated fractions of completely separated molecules @xmath74 and partially melted intermediate states @xmath5 as a function of temperature @xmath62 .",
    "the parameters used in the calculations are listed in the figure captions .",
    "the agreement of the theoretical predictions with the experimental measurements is indeed excellent .",
    "although , initially there are too many free parameters , most of them have been fixed based on different physical considerations .",
    "for example , it is noticed that the tunneling probability @xmath4 is not very sensitive to the morse potential as long as they are reasonable , but depends sensitively on the factor @xmath75 that decides the nature of the entropic barrier . on the otherhand ,",
    "the fraction @xmath5 and the peak position have strong dependence on the depth and range of the morse potential .",
    "as will be shown later , we fix the morse parameters that give optimum fits to the @xmath5 measurements .",
    "accordingly , we take @xmath76 for l60b36 and @xmath77 for l42b18 whereas @xmath78 is fixed at @xmath79 for both the sequences .",
    "in fact , these values are nearly identical to what has been used in @xcite corresponding to an at base pair .",
    "as @xmath4 is the tunneling probability , there exists a temperature @xmath80 at which the thermal activated energy @xmath54 becomes equal to the barrier height @xmath58 ( tunneling probability becomes @xmath81 ) . since the contribution of the morse potential is negligible outside the well , it is basically the flat portion of the stacking interaction @xmath82 that decides the height of the entropic barrier . equating @xmath54 with @xmath58 at @xmath80 and using the approximation @xmath83",
    ", we get    t_d = [ td ] .",
    "thus , the above relation puts the constraint on the choice of @xmath73 and @xmath9 . for same @xmath80",
    ", we may have different combinations of @xmath84 and @xmath9 . in practice , @xmath84 is really not a free parameter which can be varied randomly as it also controls the temperature dependent effective mass that appears in eq.([sch2 ] ) .",
    "although , we have tried various combinations , it is found that the fit is optimum when @xmath9 is close to @xmath85 .",
    "this is an interesting observation as this distance also corresponds to an average stretching beyond which the hydrogen bonds start breaking .",
    "as we have discussed before , @xmath9 is a phase space factor associated with the configurational partition function .",
    "it is probably meaningful to expect @xmath9 of the order of @xmath85 for the configurational changes to occur .",
    "subsequently , we fix @xmath9 at @xmath86 which is an optimum choice for all the sequences . with",
    "@xmath9 fixed , eq.([td ] ) now gives a very simple but an important relation which can be used to estimate the stiffness parameter @xmath73 directly by knowing @xmath80 which can be measured experimentally .",
    "for example , from the experimental curves , we estimate @xmath87 for l60b36 and @xmath88 for l42b18 . with the choice of @xmath89 , we get @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the above two sequences .",
    "although , knowing the full stiffness @xmath84 is itself important , yet we do not know how to split it between @xmath29 and @xmath36 .",
    "however , taking the guidance from ref @xcite where @xmath36 was taken @xmath92 , we find @xmath29 should be @xmath93 .",
    "subsequently , we fix @xmath29 at @xmath94 for all the sequences and consider the co - operative parameter @xmath36 as a variable which , although should be close to @xmath95 , can be used as tuning parameter so as to reproduce the correct mid point temperature @xmath80 .",
    "thus , with @xmath96 , @xmath78 , @xmath9 , @xmath29 and @xmath36 fixed , we are now left with only two free parameters @xmath38 and @xmath34 which are finally adjusted to reproduce the experimental measurements .",
    "as listed in the figure captions , the strength @xmath36 turns out to be @xmath97 for l60b36 whereas it is @xmath98 for l42b18 .",
    "this slight variation is expected as both the sequences have different dissociation temperature @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , the range and diffuseness parameters are found to be @xmath99 and @xmath100 for l60b36 sequence .",
    "the corresponding values for l42b18 are @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "although it is difficult to draw any definite conclusion , the length @xmath38 seems to depend strongly on the size of the bubble forming at rich region or more precisely on the ratio @xmath103 which are @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively for the above two oligomers .",
    "it may be mentioned here that this observation is more meaningful for these two oligomers which have identical endpoints and may not be valid in general .",
    "however , all sequences studied in this work have a nearly flat entropic barrier over a larger range . this effect ,",
    "probably , can be interpreted as the reminiscent of a long range co - operative phenomena .",
    "the parameters for @xmath5 are also fixed in a similar way .",
    "since the entropic barrier turns out to be nearly constant up to the range @xmath38 , @xmath5 has been estimated using eq.([sig ] ) with the ground state wave function given by eq.([phi ] ) .",

    "@xmath69 where @xmath80 is the dissociation temperature at which @xmath4 becomes half whereas @xmath69 is the melting temperature above which the bound state vanishes .",

    "we take @xmath42 as in @xcite and use @xmath76 for l60b36 and @xmath77 for l42b18 to reproduce the @xmath5 curves .",
    "it is also noticed that the optimum results are obtained when @xmath109 , i.e. the range of the entropic barrier .",
    "subsequently , we set @xmath110 and adjust @xmath108 which turns out to be @xmath111 for both the sequences .",
    "therefore , by putting the constraint to explain both @xmath4 and @xmath5 measurements simultaneously , we have fixed most of the free parameters of the model .",
    "although , @xmath108 is expected to be @xmath112 , a value of @xmath111 is indeed too large as compared to the minimum threshold of average stretching @xmath113 above which hydrogen bond between the base pairs starts breaking .",
    "this large value of @xmath108 probably is very specific to these two oligomers whose end points are fixed by a relatively stronger gc rich regions .",
    "an unzipping transition leading to the continuous melting may begin with a nucleating bubble initiating from the softer at rich middle region .",
    "since this melting is a competition between the energy of the bound states and the entropy of the dissociated states , the transition may not proceed until the bubble radius attains a minimum value which is about @xmath111 for these oligomers .",
    "a stretching distance of @xmath114 would mean a nucleating bubble of diameter @xmath115 containing about @xmath116 to @xmath117 open base pairs . unless the size attains this minimum value , the entropy gain is not sufficient enough for the bubble to grow .",
    "note that this minimum size is different from the critical bubble size which is required to drive a spontaneous transition .",
    "the @xmath108 value strongly depends on the size and composition of the sequence .",
    "we have found that @xmath108 value is much smaller if the sequence is homogeneous . since the bubble forming at region of l60b36 and l42b18 oligomers",
    "are bounded by relatively stronger gc rich regions at the end , the denaturated bubble may encounter higher resistance to grow due to strong binding . this is to say that the interaction of the bubble with itself and also with its surroundings may bring a reduction in entropy .",
    "therefore , for a given entropy gain , the minimum bubble size required to grow ( by compensating the binding energy ) for the sequence with fixed end points is larger then the case when the sequence is open at both the ends .",
    "this could be viewed as analogous to the excluded volume interaction whose effect is to reduce the entropy of the loop .",
    "notice that when @xmath108 is large or the range @xmath118 is small , the @xmath5 contribution decreases .",
    "another parameter which may also suppress @xmath5 yield is the strong binding effect of the base pair .",
    "if the binding energy is large , i.e. if the @xmath107 ratio is large , the temperature @xmath69 at which the bound state vanishes goes up where as the dissociation temperature @xmath80 remains unaffected .",
    "if @xmath119 , complete dissociation may take place much earlier , thus reducing the fraction of continuous melting .",
    "therefore , in either case , the most probable route available for denaturation is the sudden melting thus making the transition to appear discontinuous .",
    "it may be mentioned here that for a complete strand separation , it is not necessary to raise the temperature until all the base pairs break .",
    "normally , the nucleation is initiated with a small denaturating bubble from the softer at rich region .",
    "when the average bubble size attains a critical value , the loop entropy becomes sufficient enough to overcome the binding so that rest of the base pairs unwind instantly .",
    "the critical sized bubble is formed either through a sequential unzipping process what is known as a continuous melting or through the sudden opening due to coherent fluctuation ( followed by tunneling ) . in the first approach",
    ", the critical size is reached when the temperature is close to the melting point whereas the second process can happen at any temperature with different probabilities .",
    "since the tunneling probability @xmath4 depends only on the entropic barrier parameters , the heterogeneity of the sequence which introduces a site dependent binding @xmath120 , does not affect the full dissociation yield .",
    "on the otherhand , the fraction of the continuous yield @xmath5 is strongly affected by the heterogeneity of the sequence . by design",
    ", the bubble formation for l60b36 and l42b18 is initiated in the at rich middle region . since the at rich region for l60b36",
    "is long enough , the critical bubble size may still remain confined to the homogeneous middle portion only . for l42b18 , the homogeneous at region may not be long enough and the bubble may extend upto the gc rich region also . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath5 transition may encounter different melting regions with appropriate weights . as can be seen",
    ", the @xmath5 peak for l60b36 is more sharper as compared to the case of l42b18 sequence where the gc region may start contributing .",
    "this curve can be better understood as a weighted sum over two melting regions with appropriate weights although @xmath4 curve can still be understood as a single tunneling phenomenon through an appropriate entropic barrier .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show the comparison of @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the corresponding experimental results using the set of parameters as listed in the figure captions 2 and 3 .",
    "the linear rise of the total open base pairs @xmath6 after the sigmoidal transition is a well - known phenomenon attributed to the residual base unstacking in the single strands .",
    "however , the theoretical prediction of @xmath6 does not increase beyond unity as this effect has not been included in the present model .",
    "as shown in figures ( 2 - 5 ) , the present model has been quite successful in explaining both qualitatively and quantitatively experimental observations .",
    "we have also studied two more oligomers l42v1 and l48as for which experimental data points are available @xcite .",
    "the l42v1 sequence is @xmath121 base pairs long with @xmath122 at base pairs in the middle whereas l48as is @xmath123 base pairs long with a at rich region of @xmath124 base pairs which is open at one end .",
    "figure 6 shows the plot of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath62 for the above two oligomers with the parameters listed in the figure captions .",
    "the @xmath38 parameter is found out to be @xmath125 for l42v1 with a diffuseness value of @xmath126 .",
    "this oligomer ( a @xmath103 ratio of @xmath127 ) is quite identical to l42b18 oligomer in design .",
    "accordingly , the parameters of @xmath128 follows the systematic and also the full dissociation probability is quite close to that of l42b18 oligomer .",
    "interestingly , this oligomer has no contribution to @xmath5 as it melts suddenly at all temperatures . as mentioned before",
    ", the vanishing of @xmath5 component would mean a vanishing range ( @xmath129 ) or a higher effective binding energy which pushes the melting temperature @xmath69 to the higher side .",
    "since l42v1 is quite similar to l42b18 in design , it is difficult to understand why @xmath5 vanishes for the former whereas this component is still significant for the later oligomer .",
    "although this needs more careful analyses , a possible reason could be different buffer conditions in which the dna solutions were prepared .",
    "it is known that a stronger ionic concentration may increase the binding ( higher @xmath96 , hence higher @xmath69 ) while the entropic parameters may still remain unchanged . on the otherhand ,",
    "the melting behavior of l48as is quite different from the rest of the oligomers as it opens from one end .",
    "it has a range which is relatively larger @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) .",
    "the large entropic range explains why @xmath4 component is small with a relatively larger @xmath5 contribution .",
    "we have not estimated the @xmath5 fraction , but it is expected to be broad with contributions coming from two different melting regions .    the temperature driven denaturation has also been studied for synthetic ploy ( a)- ploy ( t ) oligomers of various lengths in different buffer conditions @xcite .",
    "these oligomers can be regarded as homogeneous duplexes held together by identical base pair interaction at the different sites . although , the measurements do not separate the fractions into fully dissociated and partially open components , the total fraction @xmath6 is itself interesting as it has a large not so well understood premelting region .",
    "the peak and width of the derivative with respect to temperature also show strong dependence on the length of the oligomer as well as on the buffer conditions . due to finite size effects",
    ", the co - existence of both the components is expected for these oligomers also .",
    "since data is not available , we will not try to estimate @xmath4 and @xmath5 exactly so as to reproduce the total yields , rather we will discuss a scenario based on which the experimental results can be understood at least qualitatively .",
    "again as before , we consider an arbitrary oligomer which may have similar potential parameters like l60b36 oligomer except for the fact that this oligomer is now homogeneous .",
    "a homogeneous sequence may have a lower @xmath108 value than when the sequence composition is more heterogeneous .    as a model study , we choose @xmath132 , i.e. the minimum expected value . as the @xmath108 decreases , the behavior of @xmath5 changes completely , becoming more uniform as @xmath108 decreases from a higher threshold value towards @xmath37 .",
    "figure 7 shows a typical plots of @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 as a function of @xmath62 where we have set @xmath108 to its lowest value .",
    "although we have used a normalization factor @xmath133 , it can be adjusted so as to reproduce the appropriate yield in the premelting region .",
    "the total yield is quite similar ( at least qualitatively ) to what one observes experimentally @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the so called premelting region is probably due to a continuous transition which has nearly uniform probability up to temperature @xmath69 above which the transition becomes discontinuos .",
    "since below @xmath69 , the continuous process dominates , a zipper type model may be found more appropriate to describe this type of melting curve , particularly when the sequence is homogeneous and also relatively large .",
    "it is also observed that the length of the entropic range @xmath38 depends on the length of the sequence , i.e. for the same composition , @xmath38 increases with the length of the sequence probably until an upper limit is reached .",
    "so the smaller sequence will have short ranged entropic barrier with increased @xmath4 contribution .",
    "when the size is very short ( @xmath52 bp ) , it may completely dissociate without any intermediate state .",
    "this explain why a two step model is found more appropriate to describe the melting behavior of very short oligomers .    since the premelting region is flat , the non vanishing part of the derivative of the total yield is basically due to the fraction @xmath4 .",
    "figure 8 shows the plot of @xmath134 ( estimated numerically ) as a function of @xmath62 for different co - operativity parameters .",
    "the curves on then left correspond to the case when @xmath135 whereas the curves on the right are for @xmath136 .",
    "on both the sides , the solid curve corresponds to the parameters as listed in the figure captions while the dotted and dashed curves are obtained when either @xmath38 or @xmath34 is changed .",
    "the point which needs to be stressed here is that the peak positions ( hence the temperature @xmath80 ) are quite sensitive to the strength @xmath36 which may be small for smaller oligomers .",
    "therefore , the shift in peak positions of the oligomers to the higher values when the length increases can be understood on the basis of the increase of the @xmath36 parameter . on the otherhand ,",
    "the width and the height are very sensitive to @xmath38 and @xmath34 parameters which also depend on the length of the oligomers as well as on the buffer conditions .",
    "therefore , with suitable @xmath36 , @xmath38 and @xmath34 parameters , it is possible to understand all aspects of the melting behavior of the synthetic oligomers studied in @xcite .",
    "based on the above studies , we have several conclusions to make .",
    "recall again , a large dna sequence melts with the initiation of the nucleating bubbles at different regions which are relatively soft .",
    "a complete strand separation occurs when the average bubble size attains a critical value .",
    "depending on the nature of the entropic barrier , the domain melting occurs either through continuous opening of base pairs or due to coherent fluctuation followed by tunneling .",
    "however , at this level , whatever may be the process of domain melting , the complete dissociation of the full sequence will not be realized unless the average bubble size attains a limiting value so that the entropic gain becomes sufficient to overcome the bound state energy .",
    "once the melting point is reached , a complete strand separation occurs what appears as a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "therefore , the complete dna denaturation in the thermodynamic limit can be interpreted as a first order phase transition characterized by a sharp melting temperature at which the bound state vanishes . however , due to finite size effect as in the case of oligomers , both type of processes , one due to continuous opening and the other due to the sudden melting , may co - exist and the concept of a phase transition is not strictly applicable .",
    "therefore , we invoke a barrier penetration phenomena along with the bound state solution to explain these two fractions separately . although , it is not possible to draw any definite conclusions unless more experimental data sets of various synthetic oiligomers are available with different design , we can only make a few qualitative remarks as follows .",
    "the available measurements seem to support a long ranged entropic barrier with parameters which depend on the length and composition of the sequence . for the same length ,",
    "the range of the sequence made up of gc base pairs is higher than when the sequence is homogeneous with at base pairs .",
    "consequently , the gc rich sequence will have less @xmath4 and more @xmath5 contributions as compared to the at rich sequence .",
    "if the oligomer is short enough ( @xmath52 bp ) and homogeneous , a sudden melting may occur due to an entropic barrier which is very short ranged ( small value of @xmath38 ) .",
    "these oligomers will also not have any continuous fraction due to vanishing @xmath118 range and the full melting process can be explained by the so called two state model . on the otherhand , with increasing size of the oligomers , the entropic barrier range increases ( due to stronger collectivity ) and the full dissociation probability @xmath4 decreases .",
    "if @xmath108 is close to zero , continuous opening takes place with equal probability at all temperatures until the melting point is reached . as seen in @xcite , these type of processes are characterized by a slowly rising pre - melting region followed by a sudden transition and are more suitable to be described by the zipper type model as contrast to the two state phenomena .",
    "the melting behavior of the oligomers studied in @xcite can also be understood as the sum of two components .",
    "these two oligomers l60b36 and l42b18 with the @xmath103 ratios of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are clamped at both the ends with identical gc rich regions . since the relative at length is large enough , the bubble forming region is homogeneous and the corresponding @xmath38 values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 are probably following the @xmath103 ( relative length ) systematic .",
    "the l60b36 has a longer entropic barrier than l42b18 and the corresponding fraction @xmath4 is also less for l60b36 . on the otherhand ,",
    "the entropic range is smaller for l42b18 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath5 contribution is also less as compared to l60b36 .",
    "however , the key aspect where these two oligomers differ from not being homogeneous is the higher @xmath108 value of about @xmath139 which makes the peak to valley ratio in the @xmath5 yield very distinct .",
    "the oligomer l42v1 which is nearly identical to l42b18 has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "while this oligomer has a comparable @xmath4 yield , it does not have any @xmath5 component .",
    "this aspect is interesting and needs further investigations . on the otherhand ,",
    "the oligomer l48as has a @xmath103 ratio of @xmath140 with more gc components and also with a large entropic range .",
    "consequently , the @xmath4 component for this type of oligomer is negligible and the transition mostly proceeds through continuous opening . for the same reason , as remarked in @xcite , even shorter oligomer ( down to @xmath141 bp ) which unzips from one end may open continuously .",
    "finally , we would like to add here that the shape of the intermediate fraction yield @xmath5 depends strongly on the sequence heterogeneity since @xmath120 becomes site dependent . however , the full dissociation probability @xmath4 is still can be obtained from the barrier penetration formalism as it is sensitive only to the entropic barrier .",
    "the temperature at which the full dissociation probability becomes half is directly related to the dna stiffness parameter . for the sequence for which @xmath142 , the mid point of the full absorption curve @xmath6 can be used to estimate the stiffness parameter . in general , @xmath80 need not be same as @xmath69 . since @xmath80 relates directly to the stiffness parameter and",
    "also its derivative is more sensitive to the parameters of the entropic barrier , it will be more meaningful to study these two components @xmath4 and @xmath5 separately .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "giovanni zocchi and yan zeng for providing the tabulated values of the experimental data points .",
    "a linear chain of dna molecules can be described by the hamiltonian given by      where @xmath143 and @xmath144 correspond to the displacements of the bases at site @xmath13 along the direction of the hydrogen bond , and @xmath145 is the potential between the base pairs which can be of the morse type      in terms of the variables @xmath146 and @xmath147 , the above hamiltonian can be written as h=_n \\ { + } + h ( x_n , x_n-1 ) + h ( y_n , y_n-1 ) , [ ham2 ] where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the canonical momenta , and            where @xmath150 with @xmath151 being boltzmann s constant , and @xmath152 is plank s constant .",
    "the integrals for the variables @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 are of the gaussian type , and give , respectively z_p = z_q=(2 m k_t ) ^n/2 ,   z_x= ( 2 k_t /k ) ^n/2 .",
    "the remaining configurational partition function @xmath10 involves nonlinear morse potential , and given by      the factor @xmath9 ( dimension of length ) has been in introduced to make @xmath10 dimensionless .",
    "the above integral can be evaluated by using the transfer integral ( ti ) method defined by dy_n-1",

    "[ ti ]    to compute the integral , we consider a finite chain of @xmath63 base pairs and chose periodic boundary conditions by demanding that @xmath156 .",
    "this amounts to adding a fictitious base pair with index @xmath37 which has the same dynamics as base pair @xmath63 , with a simultaneous introduction of a factor @xmath157 .",
    "consequently , eq.([zy ] ) can be written as      the @xmath158 function of @xmath10 can be expanded on the base of the eigenfunctions of the ti operator as @xmath159 .",
