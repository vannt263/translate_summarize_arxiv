    "the pioneering experiments of projectile fragmentation at relativistic energies of @xmath0ar and @xmath1ca beams at the lbl bevalac  @xcite have demonstrated the potential of this method for the production of exotic nuclei .",
    "based on these ideas , the sis / frs facility  @xcite at gsi has used also heavier projectiles like e.g. @xmath2ni , @xmath3kr , @xmath4xe , and @xmath5pb to produce and study exotic nuclei  @xcite . for planning such experiments ,",
    "when count - rate predictions are needed , analytical descriptions of fragmentation cross sections are useful .",
    "they are also useful in simulation programs for projectile - fragment separators ( like e.g. intensity  @xcite or mocadi  @xcite ) .",
    "compared to physical models of high - energy fragmentation reactions , which in general involve time - consuming monte - carlo calculations , the virtue of an analytical formula lies in the short computing time and the possibility to calculate easily sub - microbarn cross sections that are beyond the reach of physical - model calculations .    in 1990 , smmerer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a universal empirical parametrization of fragmentation cross sections ( `` epax '' , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which was based on and similar to previous prescriptions by rudstam  @xcite and silberberg _ et al . _",
    "the parametrization was to a large extent based on multi - gev proton - induced spallation cross sections , since only scarce heavy - ion induced experimental data were available at that time .",
    "meanwhile , more precise data from relativistic heavy - ion - induced fragmentation reactions together with recent results from projectile fragmentation of heavy nuclei ( @xmath6au and @xmath5pb ) on h@xmath7 targets  @xcite ) allow a more stringent comparison of proton- and heavy - ion induced isotope distributions .",
    "this comparison indicates that for heavy nuclei the two reactions lead to different isotopic distributions , which can not be obtained from each other just by scaling factors .",
    "this can be easily understood since heavy - ion induced reactions are expected to deposit more excitation energy in a nucleus than proton - induced reactions , making the final product distributions  after evaporation  broader and more neutron - deficient .",
    "nevertheless , the data show that in both cases the isotopic yield distributions can be well described by gaussian - like analytical functions with parameters that vary smoothly as a function of fragment mass  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we will base the choice of these parameters exclusively on heavy - ion - induced reaction data .",
    "we will first review briefly the basic characteristics of the epax formula and then show which modifications are necessary to improve the accuracy with which the new experimental results can be reproduced",
    ". this will be followed by a brief comparison with similar attempts by other authors .",
    "the basic characteristics of the analytical description of high - energy fragmentation cross sections by the epax formula are the following  @xcite :    * in the absence of systematic excitation - function measurements of heavy - ion induced fragmentation reactions , the formula is valid only for the so - called `` limiting fragmentation '' regime , i.e. for projectile energies where the fragmentation yields are no longer energy dependent , at least within the accuracy of the formula ( approximately within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "this is certainly true for incident energies considerably above the fermi energy in nuclei ( @xmath8 40 @xmath9 mev ) , in particular for the typical sis energies of 500 to 1000 @xmath9 mev . *",
    "the epax formula is meant to describe the fragmentation of medium- to heavy - mass projectiles ; nucleon - pickup cross sections are not included .",
    "no attempt is made to describe the fragmentation of fissile nuclei .",
    "therefore , the range of validity is limited to projectiles from around argon to below the lead and bismuth isotopes .",
    "predictions for production cross sections of fission products or of fragments below u where fission competition is significant require an elaborate description of the fission process , such as can be found e.g. in a recent publication by benlliure _",
    "_  @xcite . * for fragments sufficiently far away from the projectile ( i.e. for mass losses larger than 15 - 20% of the projectile mass ) , the isotope distributions are largely independent of the original nucleus ; their position , shape , and width depend only on the fragment mass number .",
    "this constitutes what has been termed the `` residue corridor '' and is related to the fact that the isotope distributions are mainly governed by statistical evaporation from highly excited prefragments produced in collisions between relativistic heavy ions . * for fragments that involve only a small mass loss from the projectile , the isotope distributions should be centered close to the projectile and their variance should be small .",
    "therefore , a smooth transition is anticipated between the residue corridor and the projectile .",
    "the parametrization of this smooth transition constitutes the main task in designing the formula .    in a first step",
    ", a parameter set has been searched for that describes the fragmentation yields from projectiles located close to the line of @xmath10stability . in a second step , a modification of the yield distributions due to the neutron or proton excess of projectiles located on the neutron- or proton - rich side of the line of @xmath10stability (",

    "the second term describes the `` charge dispersion '' , the distribution of elemental cross sections with a given mass around its maximum , @xmath16 .",

    "[ eq17 ] is very similar to what has been suggested by von egidy and schmidt  @xcite to reproduce production cross sections from antiproton annihilation .",
    "the overall agreement with the experimental fragmentation yields studied in our work is worse , however , when we adopt their description of the memory effect , in particular on the neutron - rich side .",

    "do they represent a rare example of cross - section measurements down to the sub - nanobarn level , but also a case where severe discrepancies with epax version 1 were observed : the yields of even-@xmath11 isotopes close to the proton drip line where found to be enhanced in experiment by factors of up to 750  @xcite . as a remedy for this deficiency ,",
    "we have chosen to switch over from quasi - gaussian to exponential slopes of the charge distribution above a certain gradient of the cross - section distribution . in order to achieve a steady transition between the two slopes , the transition point and the slope of the exponential have to be adjusted carefully .",
    "for this purpose , we calculate the derivative of the logarithm of the cross section ( eq .

    "[ eq1 ] at this point .",
    "the gradient for which we switch to the exponential slope has to be parametrized as a function of the fragment mass @xmath9 .",
    "as for the moment only the @xmath2ni data exhibit this exponential trend ( the measured cross sections in the @xmath76sn region reach the same cross section level , but are further away from the proton drip line ) , we tried to adjust the function @xmath81 in such a way to reproduce the @xmath2ni data without deteriorating the good agreement with the measured @xmath77xe data .",

    "therefore , we think that some caution should be applied when using epax predictions for projectiles very far from stability like e.g. @xmath57sn . here , no experimental data at all exist to verify the epax predictions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the quality with which epax reproduces measured high - energy fragmentation cross sections could be improved considerably by introducing rather small modifications to the formula .",

    "this is the difference in experimental cross sections for @xmath76sn production from a @xmath50sn beam of roughly a factor of 100 in recent ganil and gsi experiments  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these intermediate - energy data are measured with separators having very low transmissions ( of the order of few percent ) which are difficult to measure experimentally .",
    "it would be interesting , however , to compare epax also to cross sections obtained at lower incident energies once high - quality data become available .",
    "a fortran program of the epax formula as well as additional graphs comparing experimental data to epax predictions can be downloaded from the following address :  ftp://ftpcenbg.in2p3.fr/pub/nex/epax .",
    "we wish to thank our colleagues jose benlliure , roman gernhuser , manuel de  jong , akira ozawa , jrg reinhold , robert schneider , shuying wan , and martin weber for providing their experimental cross sections prior to publication .",
