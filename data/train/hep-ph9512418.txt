    "as it is widely known now , only part ( less than one third in fact ) of the proton spin is due to quark spins @xcite .",
    "these results can be interpreted in the effective qcd approach ascribing a substantial part of hadron spin to an orbital angular momentum of quark matter .",
    "it is natural to guess that this orbital angular momentum might be revealed in asymmetries in hadron production . in the recent paper @xcite we considered a possible origin of asymmetry in the pion production under collision of a polarized proton beam with unpolarized proton target and argued that the orbital angular momentum of partons inside constituent quarks leads to significant asymmetries in hadron production with polarized beam .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to an ozi - violating process of @xmath1meson production @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms were proposed recently as a source of the significant asymmetries observed in pion production : higher twist effects @xcite , correlation of @xmath2 and spin in structure @xcite and fragmentation @xcite functions , rotation of valence quarks inside a hadron @xcite .",
    "significant role in part of above references also belongs to orbital angular momentum .",
    "recent reviews of theoretical and experimental aspects of single ",
    "spin asymmetry studies have been given in @xcite .",
    "in the model @xcite the behavior of asymmetries in inclusive meson production was predicted to have a specific @xmath3dependence , in particular , vanishing asymmetry at @xmath4 , its increase in the region of @xmath5 , and @xmath3independent asymmetry at @xmath6 .",
    "parameter @xmath7 gev / c is determined by the scale of chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking .",
    "such a behavior of asymmetry follows from the fact that the constituent quarks themselves have slow ( if at all ) orbital motion and are in the @xmath8state , but interactions with @xmath6 resolve the internal structure of constituent quark and feel the presence of internal orbital momenta inside this constituent quark .",
    "we consider a nonperturbative hadron to be consisting of the constituent quarks located at the core of the hadron and quark condensate surrounding this core .",
    "experimental and theoretical arguments in favor of such a picture were given , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we refer to effective qcd and use the njl model @xcite as a basis .",
    "the lagrangian in addition to the @xmath9fermion interaction of the original njl model includes @xmath10fermion @xmath11breaking term .",
    "strong interaction radius of this quark is determined by its compton wavelength : @xmath12 , where the constant @xmath13 is universal for different flavors .",
    "spin of constituent quark @xmath14 in this approach is determined by the sum @xmath15 .",
    "the value of the orbital momentum contribution into the spin of constituent quark can be estimated with account for the experimental results from deep ",
    "inelastic scattering .",
    "the important point what the origin of this orbital angular momentum is .",
    "it was proposed @xcite to consider an analogy with an anisotropic generalization of the theory of superconductivity which seems to match well with the above picture for a constituent quark .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we described how the orbital angular momentum , i.e. orbital motion of quark matter inside constituent quark , can be connected with the asymmetries in inclusive production at moderate and high transverse momenta and have given the predictions for @xmath3dependence of asymmetry . in this note",
    "we specify @xmath0dependence of asymmetries . in section 2",
    "we give a brief outline of the model , section 3 is devoted to the description of an @xmath0dependence of asymmetry in inclusive pion production and in section 4 we give short conclusion .",
    "we consider the hadron processes of the type @xmath16 with polarized beam or target and @xmath17 being a charged pion .    in the model constituent quarks are supposed to scatter in a quasi - independent way by some effective field which is being generated at the first stage of interaction under overlapping of peripheral condensate clouds @xcite .",
    "inclusive production of hadron @xmath17 results from recombination of the constituent quark ( low @xmath3 s , soft interactions ) or from the excitation of this constituent quark , its decay and subsequent fragmentation in the hadron @xmath17 .",
    "the latter process is determined by the interactions at distances smaller than constituent quark radius and is associated therefore with hard interactions ( high @xmath3 s ) .",
    "thus , we adopt a two  component picture of hadron production which incorporates interactions at large and small distances .",
    "we supposed that @xmath18mesons are produced mostly by up flavors and @xmath19mesons  by down flavors .    in the expression for asymmetry",
    "@xmath20 @xcite @xmath21 the function @xmath22 is the generalized reaction matrix @xcite and the functions @xmath23 can be expressed through its multiparticle analogs @xcite , @xmath13 denotes the set of kinematical variables for the detected meson . in the model the spin  independent part @xmath24 gets contribution from the processes at small ( hard processes ) as well as at large ( soft processes ) distances , i.e. @xmath25 , while the spin ",
    "dependent part @xmath26 gets contribution from the interactions at short distances only @xmath27 .",
    "the function @xmath28 gets a nonzero value due to interference between the two helicity amplitudes , which gain different phases due to internal motion of partons inside the constituent quark .",
    "the following relation between the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 has been proposed assuming the effect of internal motion of partons inside constituent quark leads to a shift in the produced meson transverse momentum : @xmath30 i^h_+(s , b,\\xi),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the polarization of the leading constituent quark @xmath32 ( in the process of the meson @xmath17 production ) and @xmath33 is the mean value of internal angular momentum inside the constituent quark .",
    "this relation allowed to get a parameter  free prediction for the @xmath3dependence of asymmetries in inclusive pion production @xcite .",
    "we have considered there @xmath34 being a constant .",
    "here we assume @xmath34 being a function of @xmath0 and consider the behavior of asymmetry in the beam fragmentation region ( where @xmath35 ) .",
    "the @xmath0dependencies of the functions @xmath36 and @xmath29 are determined by the distribution of constituent quarks in a hadron and by the structure function of constituent quark respectively : @xmath37 taking into account the above relations , we can represent inclusive cross  section in the unpolarized case @xmath38 and asymmetry @xmath20 in the following forms : @xmath39,\\label{cs}\\ ] ]    @xmath40 { w_+^h(s,\\xi ) } } { { [ w_+^s ( s,\\xi)+w_+^h(s,\\xi)]}},\\label{an}\\ ] ]    where the functions @xmath41 are determined by the interactions at large and small distances : @xmath42",
    "the asymmetry in the model has a significantly different @xmath0-dependence in the regions of transverse momenta @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore we consider these two kinematical regions separately . for that purpose",
    "it is useful to introduce the ratio @xmath45 where the function @xmath46 in its turn is the @xmath0independent ratio @xmath47 the expression for the asymmetry @xmath48 can be rewritten in the form @xmath49 { r(s , x , p_{\\perp})}/ { [ 1 + r(s , x , p_{\\perp})]},\\ ] ] the function @xmath50 at @xmath51 since in this region dominate short distance processes and due to the similar reason @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "thus we have simple @xmath3independent expression for asymmetry at @xmath51 @xmath54 \\label{las}\\ ] ] and a more complicated one for @xmath53 @xmath55 \\frac{\\omega_{\\tilde q/\\tilde",
    "q}(x ) } { \\omega_{\\tilde q / h_1}(x ) } r(s , p_{\\perp } ) .",
    "\\label{sas}\\ ] ] as it is clearly seen from eq .",
    "( [ sas ] ) the asymmetry at @xmath53 has a nontrivial @xmath3dependence . in this region asymmetry",
    "vanishes at small @xmath3 and is suppressed also by the factor + @xmath56 which can be considered as the ratio of sea and valence quark distributions in hadron .",
    "the @xmath0dependence of asymmetry in this kinematical region strongly depends on particular parameterization of these distributions .",
    "we therefore will consider the region of transverse momenta @xmath51 where the @xmath0dependence of asymmetry has a simple form reflecting corresponding dependence of leading constituent quark polarization . in @xcite the two different cases were considered @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the latest choice seems to be in better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "it is evident also that the experimental data @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ las ] ) point out increase of @xmath31 with @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we take the above values of constituent quark polarization as the maximal ones and consider the simplest possible dependencies , e.g. linear and quadratic ones : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the curves corresponding to the above parameterizations are presented in figs . 1 and 2 by dashed lines .",
    "the value of @xmath62 has been taken @xcite on the basis of the analysis @xcite of the dis experimental data . as it is seen from figs . 1 and 2 the mean orbital angular momentum seems to be underestimated and experimental data prefer its greater value .",
    "indeed , another analysis of dis experiments has been carried out in @xcite and the smaller value of the total spin carried by quarks has been obtained @xmath63 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath64 . using the above value of angular orbital momentum we obtain a good agreement with the data in the case of linear dependence of constituent quark polarization and better but still not good agreement in the case of quadratic dependence of this polarization on @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding curves are presented in figs . 1 and 2 by solid lines .",
    "it seems that the existing experimental data prefer linear dependence on @xmath0 of constituent quark polarization .",
    "note also that in this model the mirror symmetry for asymmetries in @xmath18 and @xmath65 production at @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath66 takes place . due to this relation asymmetry in @xmath67 production @xmath68 since from experimental data it is known that @xmath69 .    to perform the quantitative description of @xmath0dependence of inclusive cross  sections of the pion production in the collisions of unpolarized hadrons",
    "we should choose according to eqs .",
    "( [ is ] ) , ( [ cs ] ) the particular parameterizations of the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "as it was noted these functions could be associated with the valence and sea quark distributions respectively .",
    "noting that we use the simplest forms @xcite appropriate for fragmentation region : @xmath72 and @xmath73 then for the cross - sections of inclusive @xmath74- and @xmath75- production we have : @xmath76 where the factors @xmath77 are the constants at fixed energy . using the available experimental data at @xmath78 gev / c",
    "@xcite we obtain a good agreement of eqs .",
    "( [ pp ] ) , ( [ pm ] ) with experiment at @xmath79 with the following values of the factors @xmath80 mb , @xmath81 mb , @xmath82 mb , @xmath83 mb .",
    "the corresponding results are represented in fig .",
    "we have specified in this note the @xmath0dependence of asymmetry in inclusive pion production in the beam fragmentation region in the framework of the approach formulated in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the polarization of constituent quark in the polarized proton has a nontrivial @xmath0dependence .",
    "the predictions for asymmetries given earlier in @xcite should be referred as to the fragmentation region .",
    "the above considerations suggest simple linear dependence of @xmath31 at large @xmath0 .",
    "the main role in the generation of asymmetry belongs to the orbital angular momentum of current quarks inside the constituent one .",
    "present considerations and the experimental data suggest that @xmath64 .",
    "we would like to conclude noting that the result of e143 collaboration on the measurements of @xmath84 function suggests small twist-3 matrix element @xcite and the experimental result of aleph collaboration @xcite reveals unexpectedly small polarization of @xmath85 measured in @xmath86interactions in the @xmath87-decay which implies a strong depolarization mechanism acting at the stage of fragmentation .",
    "these interesting results could have important impact on mechanisms of generation of spin asymmetries in hadron production .",
    "however , further experimental studies are needed to clarify the spin puzzles observed in the measurements of asymmetries in hadronic processes .",
