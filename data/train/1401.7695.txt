    "the cooling time of the gas is much shorter than the hubble time , allowing the system to reach a steady state where a cooling flow of 100s to 1000 m@xmath2/yr was expected to develop ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , there is a lack of cooler gas at temperatures below 2 - 3 kev ( or 1/2 to 1/3 of the virial temperature of the cluster ) observed by chandra and xmm - newton ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this means that a classic cooling flow does not exist , and the cooling is balanced by some heating sources in these cool - core clusters .",

    "* ) ; ( 3 ) a strong correlation has been observed between the existence of an agn and the cool - core status of the cluster @xcite .    besides the evidence of agn activity , many cool - core clusters",
    "are also observed to harbor line - emitting gas @xcite and to form stars at a rate typically 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the classic cooling flow rate @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest the existence of a reduced cooling flow of some sort . in some cool - core clusters , the cold gas only exists in the nuclear region while in some others , the cold gas exhibit filamentary morphology that can extend to a few 10s kpc from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "there is also a spatial correlation between the optical filaments and the enhanced soft x - ray and uv emission , indicating that the icm cooling , agn feedback , cold filaments and star formation are likely related ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we focus on the long - term evolution of the cluster in the presence of momentum - driven agn feedback .",
    "besides the basic question `` can agn feedback balance cooling '' , we also try to address the following issues : ( 1 ) is cooling perfectly balanced by agn feedback ? ( 2 ) how does numerical resolution affect the results ?",
    "( 3 ) what are the required feedback parameters such as feedback efficiency ? ( 4 ) does the model also produce cold gas distribution that is consistent with the observations ?    we describe the methodology of this work in section  [ sec : method ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present the main results of our standard simulation with @xmath5 pc resolution , and analyze how the energy is deposited , how efficient this heating mechanism is and how cooling is balanced by the heating . we also study how resolution and model parameters affect the results . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare our results with the observations and previous simulations , and discuss the success and the caveats of our model .",
    "we summarize this work in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . as in paper ii , we refer to the diffuse icm at temperatures above 1 kev as being `` hot '' and the condensed gas at temperatures around @xmath6 k as `` cold '' .",
    "we perform the simulations using enzo @xcite , a 3d amr code . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the refinement criteria of the simulations and the physics included in section  [ sec : methodology_simulations ] . in section  [ sec : methodology_initial ] , we describe the initial condition of the simulations and in section  [ sec : methodology_jet ] , the smbh accretion and jet modeling .",
    "the cooling function used in these simulations is the same as in paper i & ii for radiative cooling , which is computed based on table 4 from @xcite for gas with half - solar metallicity @xcite and a truncation temperature of @xmath7 .",
    "the refinement strategy is also the same , which is that a cell is refined whenever one of the following criteria is met : ( 1 ) the cell mass criterion  if the mass of the gas in any cell exceeds @xmath8 of that in one cell of the root grid , ( 2 ) the cooling criterion  when the ratio of the gas cooling time ( @xmath9)to the sound - crossing time over the cell becomes too small , and ( 3 ) the jeans length criterion  when the cell size is larger than @xmath10 of the jeans length .",
    "a detailed discussion of these criteria can be found in paper i. we also add a nested static refine region around the jet launching region so that this region is always refined to the highest refinement level of the simulations .",

    "i is how we model the gas properties at @xmath33 kpc . in paper",
    "i , we steepen the index of the observed gas density profile for larger radii , while here we adopt a universal temperature profile for the cluster outskirts .",
    "the resulting profiles are quite similar and since the cooling time of the gas at @xmath33 kpc is longer than the hubble time , the slight change of the initial condition has a negligible effect on the results .",
    "another difference from paper i is that in order to focus on the effect of agn feedback here , we do not introduce any initial perturbation or rotation of the gas .",
    "the accretion and jet modeling is the same as in paper ii .",
    "following @xcite , the jets in our simulations are launched along the z - axis from two circular planes perpendicular to the z - axis at a distance of @xmath38 from the x - y plane .",
    "mass , momentum and thermal energy are added to the cells in the planes at each time step . during each time step @xmath39 ,",
    "the amount of mass added to the cells follows @xmath40 where r is the distance of the cell center from the z - axis . in the standard run , @xmath38 is set to be 5 cell widths and @xmath41 is 3 .",
    "they are reduced to 2 and 1.5 cell widths respectively in the lower resolution runs to so that the physical size would increase less with lower resolution ( and larger @xmath42 ) .",
    "the effect of resolution is discussed in section  [ sec : results_resolution ] .",
    "@xmath43 is normalized such that the total outflow mass @xmath44 during @xmath39 is equal to @xmath45 , the total mass that is added to the accretion disk , which is not resolved in our simulations .",
    "the outflow rate is set to be equal to the accretion rate @xmath46 because the difference between the two is the black hole growth rate , which should be negligible in radio mode agn feedback considered here .",
    "we refer to the growth rate of the accretion disk as the accretion rate , and the accretion rate onto the smbh as the `` smbh growth rate '' through out the paper .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath46 is estimated by dividing @xmath47 , the total amount of cold gas in the vicinity of the smbh , by @xmath48 , a typical accretion time .",
    "the vicinity of the smbh in our simulations is defined as a box of size @xmath49 centered around the smbh , with @xmath50 pc in our standard simulation .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is chosen to be small enough to represent the sphere of influence of the smbh , but large enough so that the accretion region is refined by at least a few cells .",
    "thus for the two test runs with the lowest resolution , @xmath51 is increased to 1 kpc .",
    "the gas is considered `` cold '' when the temperature of the cell is lower than @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath48 is set to be 5 myr , which is roughly the average free - fall time of the gas within @xmath51 .",
    "the simulation results are not sensitive to the exact choice of @xmath53 and @xmath48 .",
    "after @xmath46 is computed as each time step , the cold gas in the accretion region is accreted by removing a fraction of the mass of the cold cells .",
    "the total jet power is : @xmath54 where @xmath23 is the feedback efficiency with a typical value of @xmath55 .",
    "since the actually jet base is much closer to the smbh than the jet launching planes in our simulations , some of the kinetic energy may have already thermalized . therefore , the kinetic energy of the jets is only @xmath56 .",
    "we will discuss the effect of varying feedback efficiency @xmath23 and kinetic fraction @xmath57 in section  [ sec : results_other_simulations ] .",
    "given @xmath46 and @xmath58 , the velocity of the injected material @xmath59 can be computed from @xmath60 , and therefore , @xmath61 . for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 km s@xmath65 .",
    "the evidence for the re - orientation of jets over @xmath66 myr timescales is seen in nearby cool - core clusters @xcite , but the physics of the jet re - orientation is beyond the scope of this study . to mimic the re - orientation of the jet , we make the jet precess at a small angle @xmath67 with a period of @xmath68 myr .",
    "this also help avoid the `` dentist drill '' effect with simple straight jet where the energy is channeled out of the cluster core seen in high resolution hydro simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "in this section , we present the main results of our simulations . we first describe the cluster evolution in our standard simulation in section  [ sec : results_evolution ] , and in section  [ sec : results_heating_cooling ] , we analyze how agn deposits its energy and balances cooling over the course of a few gyr . in section  [ sec : results_other_simulations ] , we look at the impact of resolution and model parameters on the simulation results .",
    "we present here the main results of our standard run over a few gyr timescale . during the first 200 myr , the temperature of the hot icm in the core of the cluster slowly decreases and the density increases due to radiative cooling .",
    "a global cooling catastrophe first starts to happen in the very center ( @xmath71 pc ) of the cluster at @xmath72 myr , but no gas condensation is seen outside the central cooling region .",
    "the details of the cluster evolution during the pure cooling phase can be found in paper i.     +   +   +    as soon as run - away cooling happens in the center of the cluster , agn feedback is turned on due to the presence of cold gas surrounding the smbh .",
    "the evolution of the system can be roughly divided into four stages based on the thermal status , the characteristics of the agn activity and the structure of the cold gas .",
    "the cluster first experiences a short period of low power agn feedback , and then a burst of clump formation , which leads to a few myr of chaotic cold gas condensation and accretion with a burst of agn feedback . by @xmath73 gyr , the cluster settles to its last phase with a stable cold disk and steady agn feedback .",
    "the details of each stage are discussed from section  [ sec : results_1a ] to section  [ sec : results_1d ] .",
    "a movie showing the time evolution of the gas temperature during the whole period ( from the onset of the agn feedback through the end of the simulation ) can be found here : http://vimeo.com/84807876 .",
    "the snapshots showing the gas properties in each stage are presented in figure  [ fig : projections ] at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 gyr .      from @xmath78 myr to @xmath79 myr , the temperature of the gas in the central region continues to decrease and the density continues to increase , and therefore the cooling time of the gas continues to decrease .",
    "this happens in the presence of an active smbh because the cooling rate of the gas is still low , and therefore the agn jet power is still low , so the heating from agn feedback is not enough to offset cooling yet .",
    "the first row of figure  [ fig : projections ] shows the projected gas density , temperature , entropy and pressure in the central @xmath80 kpc region . like in the early pure cooling phase",
    ", gas condensation still only happens in the very center of the cluster .",
    "outside the central cooling region , no local instability is seen to develop .    as the cooling rate of the gas increases",
    ", the jet power steadily grows to @xmath81 ergs @xmath82 when the accretion rate increases to @xmath4 m@xmath83yr at the end of this stage at @xmath79 myr .",
    "clumps of cold gas first start to form at @xmath79 myr along the propagation direction of the jets ( the second row of figure  [ fig : projections ] ) .",
    "this is because the gas inside the jet propagation cone is much more perturbed than outside .",
    "a detailed analysis of the clump formation can be found in paper ii .",
    "once the gas cools into clumps , it loses pressure support . the pressure of the clumps is lower than the icm and the sound crossing time within the clumps is longer than the cooling time .",
    "many of the newly formed clumps move outwards for a short time because of their initial positive radial velocities , but soon they rain down to the center of the cluster .",
    "many of the clumps grow bigger along the way due to their lower pressure than the surrounding icm , and some of them join each other to form larger filamentary structures . some small clumps are stripped and destroyed .",
    "this process is analogous to the high velocity clouds in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "when the clumps reach the center , due to their non - zero momentum and usually non - zero angular momentum , they oscillate and/or orbit around the smbh while some of the cold gas gets accreted .",
    "the accretion of the cold clumps increases the jet power drastically , generating stronger shock waves , which then increases the heating rate of the icm and thus its cooling time starts to increase , resulting in a decline of the formation of new clumps .",
    "this phase ends roughly when the largest cold clouds approach the center of the cluster at @xmath84 gyr .",
    "this moment is also very close to when the total amount of cold gas peaks .",
    "the evolution of the amount of cold gas in the cluster center is shown in figure  [ fig : cold_gas ] along with its angular momentum .    ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ] + , title=\"fig : \" ]      when the largest cold clouds reach the center at @xmath84 gyr , the power of the agn peaks .",
    "the cooling time of the icm is further elevated due to the increased agn heating , and the formation of new clumps along the z - axis is further suppressed . on the other hand , however , the gas condensation outside the original jet propagation cone ( along the z - axis ) starts to happen .",
    "this is related to three processes .",
    "first , the clumps that overshoot the smbh can follow a trajectory that leads them off the z - axis due to their non - zero angular momentum . as they travel through the region to the side of the jet",
    ", they can both grow larger themselves , and perturb the local icm along the way .",
    "second , the jet has been on for a few hundred myr by this time and the power of it has increased , both of which help establish a global turbulence on a larger scale throughout the core .",
    "last but most importantly , when large clouds of cold gas are present around the smbh , if they are in the way of the jet , instead of being destroyed as small clumps might be , they force the jet out through lower density regions , which effectively changes the direction of the jet .",
    "this physical process is similar to the quasar outflow confined by the cold disk in a galaxy @xcite .",
    "the motion of the cold gas surrounding the smbh is very chaotic , so the jet comes out in all random directions , perturbing the icm everywhere in the cluster core .",
    "the third row of figure  [ fig : projections ] shows that at @xmath76 gyr , the jets come out at about @xmath85 from the z - axis , causing clumps to form in that direction .",
    "the extended cold gas at this time looks strikingly similar to the @xmath0 structure in the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "the chaotic accretion of cold clouds is also seen in @xcite with cooling and continuous injection of turbulence .    like the cold clumps that cool along the z - axis earlier",
    ", the clumps formed in other directions also fall towards the center of the cluster almost ballistically .",
    "the cold clouds that have already accumulated in the center collide and combine into a rotating structure .",
    "while gas in the central area of the rotating gas cloud is accreting onto the smbh , more clumps fall down to join the cloud .",
    "because of the abundance of cold gas surrounding the smbh , even though the cooling rate of the icm has been reduced due to the agn outburst , the jet power is still high and is only slowly declining .",
    "the heating rate is still higher than the icm cooling rate .",
    "this further elevates the temperature and the cooling time of the icm , making clump formation more and more difficult .",
    "after another few hundred myr , at @xmath86 gyr , clump formation becomes very rare and all the cold gas has settled to a rotating disk : the cluster enters its last phase .",
    "the last stage lasts for a few gyr through the end of our simulation .",
    "the physical properties of the icm stay rather constant , indicating that a thermal balance is achieved and maintained over a few gyr .",
    "the icm in the core of the cluster is still cooling , but it cools in a fashion more similar to the first stage , i.e. , a reduced cooling flow is present , but gas only condenses out of the flow in the center of the cluster instead of through local instabilities as in the previous two stages .",
    "clump formation at @xmath87 kpc becomes extremely rare . in the center of",
    "the cluster , the reduced cooling flow ( of hot icm ) cools directly onto the cold disk through a mixing layer surrounding the disk .",
    "the cold disk has a size of @xmath88 kpc and a total mass of @xmath1 m@xmath2 .",
    "note that the cold disk is hollow in the very center ( the accretion zone ) , but due to its thinness , we refer to it as a `` disk '' for simplicity instead of calling it a thin torus ( see the bottom row of figure  [ fig : projections ] ) .",
    "the disk is rotationally supported as shown in figure  [ fig : kepler ] .",
    "when the hot icm cools onto the disk , it adds mass but not enough angular momentum to the disk because the hot icm is not rotationally supported .",
    "as is shown in figure  [ fig : kepler ] , the rotational velocity of the gas deviates from the keplerian velocity outside the disk .",
    "the disk self - adjusts such that the low angular momentum material is lost in the center , which then gets accreted to the smbh and the bulk of the disk stays rotationally supported .",
    "therefore , the agn jet power , which is proportional to the accretion rate , is still closely ( although not directly ) linked to the icm cooling rate through the disk .",
    "the mass of the disk grows by about @xmath89 from @xmath90 gyr to @xmath91 gyr at the end of the simulation ( see figure  [ fig : cold_gas ] ) , which corresponds to an average growth rate of about 10 m@xmath92 .",
    "the initial rotation of the disk is determined by the total angular momentum of the cold clumps formed at large distances in early stages , and is therefore random . in the long term ,",
    "the icm does add angular momentum to the disk , which is not necessarily aligned with the initial angular momentum of the disk .",
    "the interaction between the jet material and the disk can also cause a secular evolution in its rotation .",
    "therefore , the rotation direction of the disk changes slowly over a few gyr timescale , which is shown in the movie and the right panel of figure  [ fig : cold_gas ] .",
    "gyr . due to the possible warp of the cold disk",
    ", we calculate the cell mass - weighted tangential velocity as a proxy for the rotational velocity of the gas .",
    "the rotational velocity follows the keplerian velocity within the disk ( @xmath93 kpc ) , indicating that the disk is rotationally supported .",
    "[ fig : kepler ] ]      in this section , we analyze how agn heating balances icm cooling in the simulation .",
    "we first examine heating under the microscope .",
    "the shock waves observed in nearby cool core clusters are generally rather weak with only a few exceptions ( see review by * ? ? ? * ) . to measure the strength of the shocks in the simulation ,",
    "we randomly sample lines drawn from the center of the cluster outwards .",
    "we measure the gas properties along the lines and identify the location of shocks .",
    "then the mach numbers of the shocks are estimated based on the pressure jump : @xmath94         most of the shockwaves at @xmath95 kpc are weak shocks with a mach number only slightly above 1 . as an example , figure  [ fig : mach ] shows the pressure map of a slice of gas at @xmath96 gyr and the gas properties along a line .",
    "the entropy is roughly the same across the shock front , and the mach numbers measured at @xmath9714 , 25 and 33 kpc are 1.15 , 1.13 , and 1.04 , respectively .",
    "these shocks are consistent with the weak shocks observed in nearby cool core clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shock heating time scale can be roughly estimated as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the thermal energy and its average increase after each shock , and @xmath101 is the shock passing frequency . for weak shocks , @xmath102 given the typical separation between two successive shocks of @xmath103 kpc ( figure  [ fig : mach ] ) and the sound speed @xmath104 at a few 10s kpc , @xmath105 for @xmath106 , the shock heating timescale @xmath107 myr .",
    "this is comparable to the cooling time of the gas at a few tens kpc .",
    "although shock heating is important , other physical processes including sound wave @xcite and turbulent mixing @xcite also contribute to the heating of the icm .    over a few gyr timescale throughout our simulation , the icm cooling",
    "is well balanced by the agn heating . as is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : heating ] ,",
    "the instantaneous jet power closely follows the total cooling rate in the core of the cluster , calculated as the total energy loss rate through radiation within @xmath71 kpc and @xmath24 kpc .",
    "noticeably , three large peaks are seen in all three curves at @xmath108 0.7 , 1.0 , and 1.2 gyr .",
    "the cooling rate peaks when a large amount of icm cools into clumps .",
    "there is a short delay of a few tens of myr between the peak of the jet heating and the peak of the cooling .",
    "this is the time it takes for the cold clumps to fall to the smbh in the cluster center , which is of the order of magnitude of the dynamical time of the gas at a few 10s kpc where the clumps form .",
    "there is another delay between the peak of the agn power and when the icm is heated up , shown as the local minima of the cooling rate .",
    "this delay again is very short as shown in figure  [ fig : heating ] .",
    "a rough estimation gives @xmath109 myr , where 100 kpc is the core size and 1000 km / s is the typical shock velocity ( close to the sound speed for weak shocks ) .    ) and the total cooling rate in the central @xmath71 kpc and 300 kpc region of the cluster as a function of time .",

    "this is confirmed in the medium resolution simulations : the run with @xmath120 has a disk that is initially almost aligned with the y - z plane .    the simulation with @xmath121 ( hereafter refereed to as `` the low resolution simulation '' ) however , shows a different initial evolution .",
    "the clumps first form around the same time as the standard run , but both the number of clumps and the amount of gas that condenses into clumps are lower .",
    "we have shown in paper ii that the ability to resolve clumps is limited by resolution .",
    "in addition , the physical size of the jet launching planes is larger in lower resolution simulations , and therefore , the jet material has a lower density given @xmath46 , which results in a weaker perturbation , and a slower buildup of turbulence .",
    "cold clumps are also more vulnerable to destruction with lower resolution .",
    "the cold gas falls to the center and forms a rotating disk .",
    "however , unlike in the standard run , the disk is quickly accreted onto the smbh without any cold gas left , because the disk is smaller and the angular momentum is less well conserved here due to low resolution .",
    "the agn is turned off and the icm starts to cool again . at @xmath122 gyr ,",

    "the gas temperature has decreased by @xmath126 kev at @xmath127 kpc , where the cooling time has decreased . in the fourth cycle , when the disk forms , cooling overwhelms heating and the growth of the disk is faster than its consumption by the smbh .",
    "the disk stays and grows to @xmath128 m@xmath2 at the end of the simulation at @xmath129 gyr .",
    "the lowest resolution run with @xmath130 experiences even more cycles of agn outbursts before a massive stable disk finally forms at @xmath131 gyr .",
    "the time evolution of the total amount of cold gas in the central 100 kpc of the cluster in the two low resolution simulations is shown in figure  [ fig : low_resolution ] .",
    "overall , we find that simulations with higher resolution produce more realistic looking cold clumps and filaments , but as long as the resolution is above @xmath120 , the long - term evolution of the cluster stays the same : the cluster experiences four phases ending with a large cold disk described in detail in section  [ sec : results_evolution ] .",
    "when the resolution is lower than @xmath120 , the cold clumps and the cold disk are only resolved by a few cells . somewhat to our surprise , this results in cycles of agn outbursts and clump formation that seem to agree with the observations better than our standard run .",

    ". however , the choice of the parameter @xmath135 is not physically motivated , because we do not resolve the actually base of the agn jets in our simulations , which is only a few schwarzschild radii from the smbh @xcite , and it is unclear exactly how much energy is thermalized at the location of our jet launching planes .",
    "therefore , we carry out two simulations in two extreme cases to test the influence of the choice of this parameter : one with pure kinetic feedback ( @xmath136 ) and one with mostly thermal feedback ( @xmath137 ) .    with pure kinetic feedback , the jet material has even lower pressure and the jets are narrower .",
    "the clumps initially form at slightly larger radii owing to the faster velocity of the jets as we have discussed in paper ii .",
    "the rest of the cluster evolution is very similar to our standard run .",
    "the result from the simulation with mostly thermal feedback also agrees with the standard run with only a subtle difference . due to the lower velocity of the jets , most clumps form at radii slightly smaller than in the standard run with a lower initial velocity .",
    "thus the average specific angular momentum of the cold gas is smaller .",
    "the total amount of the gas that cools during the clump formation stage is comparable to the standard run , but the total angular momentum of the cold gas measured at @xmath138 gyr is only half of that in the standard simulation .",
    "this results in a slightly larger amount of cold gas accreted onto the smbh at early times , and therefore a stronger heating from the agn .",
    "the cooling rate of the icm is further reduced by @xmath139 compared with our standard simulation .",
    "overall , we find the exact choice of the kinetic fraction @xmath57 to have little effect on the long term thermal balance of the cluster , i.e. agn is able to balance cooling with a wide range of @xmath57 ( from @xmath140 to @xmath141 )",

    "to study the effect of a higher @xmath23 , we carry out a simulation with @xmath144 at medium resolution .",
    "due to the higher @xmath23 , the agn power is higher when cooling first starts to run away .",
    "thus the initial burst of clump formation at @xmath84 gyr is quickly suppressed , with the peak amount of cold gas an order of magnitude lower than our standard run .",

    "+    overall , cooling is suppressed by the agn feedback successfully in this simulation with high efficiency .",
    "however , the temperature profile of the gas becomes flat inside the cluster core at late times ( see bottom panel of figure  [ fig : high_epsilon ] ) due to the slightly excessive energy output from the agn , practically turning the cluster into a non - cool - core cluster . since agns are mostly found in the center of cool - core clusters , we consider this model acceptable but less favorable than our standard simulation with @xmath147 .",

    "the feedback efficiency in our standard simulation ( @xmath147 ) is roughly an order of magnitude lower than theirs ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) , but the general agreement between our results , as well as our test run with @xmath144 ( discussed in section  [ sec : results_epsilon ] ) shows that the results are not very sensitive to the choice of the feedback efficiency @xmath23 .",
    "both our work here and @xcite find that in a momentum - driven agn feedback model , a thermal balance can be achieved with a wide range of feedback efficiency .",

    "the critical ratio of the thermal instability timescale over the free - fall time ( @xmath152 , or the cooling time over the dynamical time @xmath153 ) for the icm to condense into a multiphase medium in our simulations is generally consistent with that found in @xcite and @xcite except at very early times . as we have discussed in paper ii",
    ", we find a critical ratio of @xmath154 for the icm to first cool into clumps .",

    "compared with @xcite , we find that even though the feedback modeling differs and our feedback efficiency @xmath23 is only @xmath150 of theirs , in both simulations , the cluster experiences a large agn outburst at early times and the system later settles to a long - lived quiescent phase . the total amount of cold gas in the last stage is larger in our simulations likely because our model cluster is much more massive than that in @xcite .",

    "momentum driven agn feedback is also found to successfully suppress cooling in the center of the cluster , which results in a smaller cooling flow and a reduced stellar mass of the bcg .",
    "+        we have shown in section  [ sec : results_heating_cooling ] that a classic cooling flow is prevented and the cooling rate in our standard simulation is reduced to @xmath3 m@xmath157yr , consistent with the estimation for the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "more directly , we can compare the mass - temperature distribution of the gas in our simulation with figure 11 of @xcite , where they fit the @xmath158 x - ray spectra with a multi - temperature model and find the total mass of the gas within each temperature bin .",

    "the recovery at around @xmath159 kev is missing in the first panel ( the initial cooling phase ) and the last panel ( the disk phase ) , but is seen in the middle two panels when the icm is cooling into extended structures that morphologically resemble the @xmath0 filaments observed in perseus .",
    "this confirms that the @xmath159 kev gas and the filaments are closely related .",
    "the correlation between the soft x - ray gas ( @xmath160 kev ) and the cold filaments is also be seen in the composite x - ray image of perseus ( e.g. figure 8 of @xcite or figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have already shown in paper ii that the @xmath0 and the soft x - ray maps correlate with each other , consistent with the observations .",

    "the bin size is @xmath162 kpc .",
    "extended cold gas is only seen at early times ( dark lines ) , and at later times all the cold gas is inside the disk of about 6 kpc .",
    "[ fig : m_r ] ]    the structure of the cold gas ( formed along the propagation direction of the jet ) in the clump formation stage in our simulation morphologically resembles the elongated molecular gas seen in some cool - core clusters such as abell 1795 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the extended filamentary structure ( see figure  [ fig : projections ] and figure  [ fig : x ] ) in the third stage looks similar to that found in perseus and some other clusters ( e.g. abell 0496 in @xcite ) .",
    "the total mass of the cold gas in our simulation ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) is higher than but still consistent with the lower limit for perseus ( @xmath163 m@xmath2 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , this much cold gas in the form of a rotating disk in the final stage of our simulations lacks observational support .",
    "even though many cool core clusters are seen to harbor a compact rotating structure in the center , the observed disks are usually orders of magnitude less massive than that in our simulation .",
    "for example , @xcite found a disk of @xmath164 kpc in hydra - a , similar to our disk in radius , but its mass is estimated to be only @xmath165 m@xmath2 .",
    "other observed disks are either of similar mass or even smaller ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the disk in our simulation also stays stable for a few gyr , which would predict most cool - core clusters to be in this stable phase .",
    "however , only a fraction of the cool - core clusters in the survey of @xcite host a compact central structure . therefore , we consider the last phase of our simulation unrealistic and thus additional physics is still needed .      as discussed in section  [ sec : discussion_obs ] , the major problem with our model is that the standard simulation produces a cold disk that is too large and stays too long compared with observations .",
    "interestingly , this problem is most serious in the high and medium resolution simulations . in the low resolution simulations , the cluster experiences cycles of clump / filament formation with short - lived disks , which is more consistent with the expectation from the observations . even though a large disk eventually forms , in the lowest resolution run with @xmath133 , the disk forms after 14 gyr , which is roughly the age of the universe .",
    "therefore , the low resolution probably has the same effect as the crucial physics that is not included in our model .",
    "two major effects of low resolution are : first , cold clumps are harder to form and more easily destroyed ; second , a cold disk is more quickly accreted onto the smbh and is thus destroyed .",
    "the physics missing in our simulations includes thermal conduction , star formation , self - gravity , magnetic fields , and viscosity .",
    "heat conduction alone is unable to prevent a classic cooling flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it does affect the temperature of the gas with cooling time of a few gyr at @xmath118 kpc , and is found to produce a more homogeneous icm with less temperature variation in the cluster core in cosmological simulations @xcite . by transporting thermal energy from larger radii inward , heat conduction may reduce the required amount of heating from the agn .",
    "@xcite found that anisotropic conduction does not change the criteria for gas to cool into multiphase medium , but it might affect the amount of the gas that cools into clumps and filaments , and reduce the disk mass at later times .    star formation has been observed in many cool core clusters , with a typical rate of @xmath166 of the mass deposition rates estimated from the x - ray assuming a steady classic cooling flow @xcite .",
    "even star bursts of much higher rates are occasionally detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "star formation does not only consume the cold gas , the feedback from stars can also locally heat up the cold gas .",
    "given the typical observed star formation rate of @xmath146 m@xmath2/yr in the center of cool - core clusters , the rotating disk in our simulation should be completely consumed by star formation alone within a few gyr , which may allow the icm to cool and experience multiple cycles of cold filament formation as seen in the low resolution simulations . the feedback from star formation may also help drive the formation of filaments @xcite .",
    "we would like to explore the effects of star formation in the near future .",
    "self - gravity may trigger instabilities inside the cold disk that can drive inflows , which may trigger accretion onto the smbh , reducing the disk mass .",
    "magnetic fields will likely make the cold clumps more filamentary as we discussed in paper ii and is shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they can also affect how heat is transported via conduction , especially around the cold filaments , and support them against gravity .    as we have mentioned earlier",
    ", we do not have explicit viscosity in our simulations . including viscosity can increase the accretion rate of the cold disk and thus reduce its mass .",
    "viscosity also helps dissipate turbulent energy @xcite , which increases the efficiency of heating .",
    "all the physics discussed above has the potential to alleviate the problem in our simulation , and may also have an impact on the filamentary cold gas , which we leave for future studies .",
    "in this study , we have performed a series of three - dimensional amr simulations examining the effect of radio - mode agn feedback in an idealized cool - core galaxy cluster built to match the observations of the perseus cluster .",
    "the key question we are trying to address here is whether agn feedback can prevent a classic cooling flow in a realistic fashion over a long period of time .",
    "we model the momentum driven agn feedback with a pair of jets precessing at a small angle , and we compute the outflow rate and the jet power based on the accretion rate of the cold gas surrounding the smbh .",
    "our standard simulation has a minimum cell - size of @xmath5 pc , and the cluster evolves for 7 gyr .",
    "our primary results are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) run - away cooling first occurs only in the very center of the cluster at @xmath72 myr while no local instability develops outside the cooling region .",
    "the cold gas is accreted onto the super - massive black hole which powers agn jets at an increasing rate as the entropy of the icm continues to decrease in the cluster core . at @xmath167 myr ,",
    "cold clumps of gas first start to form at @xmath168 kpc along the propagation direction of the agn jet due to its non - linear perturbation .",
    "the cold clumps fall to the center of the cluster roughly within a dynamical time .",
    "some of the cold gas blocks and redirects the jets to go out in other directions , causing clumps to form in all directions within the cluster core , while some feeds the smbh , increasing its power which causes the core entropy to increase and thus slows down the cooling of the icm . due to its non - zero ( random ) angular momentum , not all the gas can be accreted onto the smbh . by @xmath86 gyr ,",
    "all the cold gas has settled to a rotationally supported disk of @xmath169 kpc in radius and @xmath1 m@xmath2 in mass .",
    "the cold disk stays , keeping the agn on for a few gyr through the end of the simulation .",
    "\\(2 ) the agn heating rate traces the icm cooling rate of the cluster core . about @xmath112 of",
    "the energy goes to balance cooling within @xmath71 kpc , with the rest deposited outside of the cluster core .",
    "the mass cooling rate only briefly reaches the classic cooling flow rate at the peak of the cold clump accretion phase ; the average cooling rate is only @xmath170 m@xmath171yr , an order of magnitude lower than the classic cooling flow value .",
    "overall , the icm cooling is well balanced by agn heating , and a cool - core appearance of the cluster is also preserved .",
    "\\(3 ) the long term evolution of the cluster is not sensitive to the resolution of the simulation either , as long as it is better than @xmath172 kpc . when @xmath173 kpc , because of the smaller amount of the cold clumps and quicker accretion of the cold disk , the cold gas disk can be completely accreted and the cluster experiences cycles of clump formation followed by agn outbursts .",
    "the cold massive disk still forms eventually after a few gyr . with even coarser resolution of @xmath174 kpc ,",
    ", the period of the cycle gets shorter and the formation of the final stable disk is delayed even more ( longer than the age of the universe ) .",
    "\\(4 ) our parameter study shows that the general results are not very sensitive to the model parameters including the fraction of kinetic energy in the jet @xmath57 , and the feedback efficiency @xmath23 , with only subtle differences in the details .",
    "the self - regulating model enables agn feedback to balance cooling with a wide range of parameters ( @xmath57 from 0.1 to 1 , and @xmath23 from @xmath175 to @xmath150 ) .",

    "however , the cold disk in the final stage of our simulation is much more massive than the compact rotating structures that have ever been observed in cool - core clusters , and it stays for too long , which contradicts the observed frequency of such structures .",
