    "crystals of molecular magnets are paramagnets @xcite that have the ability to maintain macroscopic magnetization for a long time in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "this is a consequence of the magnetic bi - stability of individual molecules @xcite that in many respects behave as superparamagnetic particles .",
    "the latter is due to a large spin ( e.g. , @xmath0 for mn-12 and fe-8 ) and high magnetic anisotropy of the molecules .",
    "together with quantization of spin energy levels this leads to a distinctive feature of molecular magnets : a staircase hysteresis curve in a macroscopic measurement of the magnetization .",

    "@xcite the advantage of molecular magnets is that they , unlike conventional paramagnets , can be prepared in a variety of magnetic states even in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "spontaneous transitions between spin levels in molecular magnets are normally due to the emission and absorption of phonons . interactions of molecular spins with phonons have been studied in the context of magnetic relaxation , @xcite conservation of angular momentum , @xcite phonon raman processes , @xcite and phonon superradiance .",
    "@xcite parametric excitation of acoustic modes in molecular magnets has been studied .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that surface acoustic waves can produce rabi oscillations of magnetization in crystals of molecular magnets .",
    "@xcite in this paper we study coupled dynamics of paramagnetic spins and elastic deformations at a macroscopic level .",
    "when considering magneto - elastic waves in paramagnets the natural question is why the adjacent spins should rotate in unison rather than behave independently . in ferromagnets",
    "the local alignment of spins is due to the strong exchange interaction . due to this interaction",
    "the length of the local magnetization is a constant throughout the ferromagnet .",
    "we shall argue now that a somewhat similar quantum effect exists in a system of weakly interacting two - level entities described by a fictitious spin @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , since any product of pauli matrices reduces to a single pauli matrix @xmath2 , interaction of @xmath3 independent two - state systems with an arbitrary field @xmath4 should be linear on @xmath2 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 describes a two - state system located at a point @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 was independent of coordinates , then the hamiltonian ( [ gen - ham ] ) would reduce to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total fictitious spin of the system . in this case",
    "the interaction hamiltonian would commute with @xmath11 , thus preserving the length of the total fictitious `` magnetization '' .",
    "this observation is crucial for understanding dicke superradiance : @xcite a system of independent two - state entities behaves collectively in a field whose wavelength significantly exceeds the size of the system .",
    "when the wavelength of the field is small compared to the size of the system but large compared to the distance between the two - state entities , the same argument can be made about the rigidity of @xmath12 summed up over the distances that are small compared to the wavelength .",
    "consequently , the system that has been initially prepared in a state with all spins up , and then is allowed to evolve through interaction with a long - wave bose field , should conserve the length of the local `` magnetization '' in the same way as ferromagnets do .",
    "the relevance of the above argument to the dynamics of magnetic molecules interacting with elastic deformations becomes obvious when only two spin levels are important .",
    "this is the case when the low - energy dynamics of the molecular magnet is dominated by , e.g. , tunnel split spin - levels or when the magneto - acoustic wave is generated by a pulse of sound of resonant frequency .",
    "recently , experiments with surface acoustic waves in the ghz range have been performed in crystals of molecular magnets .",
    "@xcite the existing techniques , in principle , allow generation of acoustic frequencies up to 100 ghz .",
    "@xcite this opens the possibility of resonant interaction of generated ultrasound with spin excitations . in this paper",
    "we study coupled magneto - elastic waves in the ground state of a crystal of molecular magnets .",
    "we derive equations describing macroscopic dynamics of sound and magnetization and show that high - frequency ultrasound interacts strongly with molecular spins when the frequency of the sound equals the distance between spin levels .",
    "we obtain the dispersion relation for magneto - elastic waves and show that non - linear equations of motion also possess solutions describing solitary waves of magnetization coupled to the elastic twists .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model of spin - phonon coupling is discussed in section ii where coupled magneto - elastic equation are derived .",
    "linear magneto - elastic waves are studied in section iii where we obtain dispersion laws for bulk and surface acoustic waves .",
    "non - linear solitary waves are studied in section iv .",
    "suggestions for experiments are made in section v.",
    "we consider a molecular magnet interacting with a local crystal field described by a phenomenological anisotropy hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "the spin cluster is assumed to be more rigid than its elastic environment , so that the long - wave crystal deformations can only rotate it as a whole but can not change its inner structure responsible for the parameters of the hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "this approximation should apply to many molecular magnets as they typically have a compact magnetic core inside a large unit cell of the crystal . in the presence of deformations of the crystal lattice , given by the displacement field @xmath15 , local anisotropy axes defined by the crystal field",
    "are rotated by the angle @xmath16 as a consequence of the full rotational invariance of the system ( spins + crystal lattice ) , the rotation of the lattice is equivalent to the rotation of the operator @xmath17 in the opposite direction , which can be performed by the @xmath18 matrix in the spin space , @xcite @xmath19 therefore , the total hamiltonian of a molecular magnet in the magnetic field @xmath20 must be written as @xmath21 where @xmath13 is the anisotropy hamiltonian in the absence of phonons , @xmath22 is the zeeman hamiltonian and @xmath23 is the hamiltonian of harmonic phonons .",
    "the angle of rotation produced by the deformation of the lattice is small , so one can expand hamiltonian ( [ total hamiltonian ] ) to first order in the angle @xmath24 and obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hamiltonian of non - interacting spins and phonons @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the spin - phonon interaction term , given by @xmath29\\cdot \\delta{\\bm \\phi}\\,.\\ ] ]      for certainty , we consider a crystal of molecular magnets with the anisotropy hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a small term that does not commute with the @xmath32 operator .",
    "this term is responsible for the tunnel splitting , @xmath33 , of the levels on resonance .    at low temperature and small magnetic field , @xmath34 , when the frequency of the displacement field @xmath15 satisfies @xmath35 , only the two lowest states of @xmath13 are involved in the evolution of the system .",
    "thus , one can reduce the spin - hamiltonian of the molecular magnet to an effective two - state hamiltonian in terms of pseudospin-@xmath1 operators @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the pauli matrices in the basis of the @xmath32-states close to the resonance between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the energy difference for the resonant states at @xmath42 .",
    "the non - degenerate eigenfunctions of @xmath43 are @xmath44 with @xmath45 in terms of @xmath46 the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 are now the pauli matrices in the new basis @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 ) onto this new two - state basis results in @xmath51 with @xmath52 ) of a single molecular magnet becomes @xmath53 here we have assumed that the perturbation introduced by the spin - phonon interaction is much smaller than the perturbation @xmath31 producing the splitting @xmath33 , which will usually be the case .",
    "note also that @xmath33 and @xmath54 can in general be made @xmath55-dependent to account for possible inhomogeneities of the crystal .    when considering magneto - elastic excitations we will need to know whether they are accompanied by a non - zero local magnetization of the crystal .",
    "for that reason it is important to have the magnetic moment of the molecule , @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 being the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath58 being the bohr magneton ) , in terms of its wave function @xmath59 where @xmath60 are arbitrary complex numbers satisfying @xmath61 . with the help of eq .",

    "if the size of that volume is small compared to the wavelength of the phonon displacement field , then , as has been discussed in the introduction , @xmath69 should be approximately constant in time . according to equations ( [ mz ] ) , ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) ,",

    "this effect can be viewed as the local einstein  de haas effect : spin rotation produces a torque in the crystal lattice due to the necessity to conserve angular momentum . with the help of equations ( [ heff ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) , and ( [ 3 ] ) , using standard results of the theory of elasticity , one obtains @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are velocities of longitudinal and transverse sound .",
    "the source of deformation in the right hand side of this equation is due to the above - mentioned torque generated by the spin rotation .",
    "equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) describe coupled motion of the pseudospin field @xmath85 and the displacement field @xmath86 . it is easy to see from these equations that in accordance with the argument presented in the introduction @xmath87 is independent of time",
    ". it may , nevertheless , depend on coordinates , reflecting the structure of the initial state . in this paper",
    "we study cases in which the crystal of molecular magnets was initially prepared in the ground state @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the concentration of magnetic molecules . in this case",
    "the dynamics of @xmath90 described by equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) reduces to its rotation , with the length of @xmath91 being a constant @xmath89 .",
    "remarkably , this situation is similar to a ferromagnet , despite the absence of the exchange interaction .",
    "for magnetic molecules whose magnetic cores are more rigid than their environments , only the transverse part of the displacement field ( with @xmath92 ) interacts with the magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the elastic deformation produced by the rotation of local magnetization is a local twist of the crystal lattice , required by the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "let us consider then a transverse plane wave propagating along the x - axis . from eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) one obtains @xmath93    we shall study linear waves around the ground state @xmath94 corresponding to @xmath95 .",
