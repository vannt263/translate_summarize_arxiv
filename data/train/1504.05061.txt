    "no probability can be lost and @xmath92 for all energy levels with non - zero population .",

    "the work extraction protocol , eq .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) , has mapped @xmath105 .",
    "it is natural to ask in what reduced state @xmath106 $ ] the system is left as a result .",
    "we will here answer this question .    a crucial point to note",
    "is that not a single , unique unitary @xmath23 corresponds to maximum work extraction but that there are infinitely many .",
    "any unitary that maps the projective energy subspaces @xmath67 , with dimensions @xmath72 calculated in section [ sec : max ] , onto the projective subspaces @xmath57 will give rise to maximum work extraction . the large set of unitaries with this",
    "property forms a subset of all allowed unitaries , i.e. those that commute with @xmath107 .",
    "as a first step we look at the average final state , obtained through the application of each of these unitaries and integration over the respective haar measure , which we denote by @xmath108 .",
    "details on integration over haar unitaries can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "note that even though the unitaries @xmath23 commute with @xmath107 , @xmath109 itself need not be diagonal w.r.t . to the product basis of local energy eigenstates that defines the energy shells . while @xmath107 and @xmath109 share a simultaneous eigenbasis",
    "there is no guarantee , due to @xmath107 having degeneracies , that this is the product basis of local energy eigenstates and thus @xmath109 can have off - diagonal elements in the degenerate blocks of @xmath107 . for the diagonal part of @xmath109 w.r.t .",
    "the above basis consisting of products of energy eigenstates of individual subsystems , @xmath110 , one finds [ eq : find ] > e^-h_s",
    "e^-h_b |w_ww| , see [ derfin ] for details of the derivation .",
    "this is a factorized state where the system and bath are each in thermal states at inverse temperature @xmath8 .",
    "however , this result in itself is not sufficient to conclude that typically an almost thermal state of the system results from an individual @xmath23 .",
    "one needs to calculate also the relative variances of @xmath111 .",
    "the latter are the portions of the diagonal elements at @xmath112 of the final reduced state of the system @xmath113 that correspond to the parts of the total final state living in energy shell @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "hence , if these relative fluctuations are small one will typically get diagonal elements of @xmath113 that resemble their averages , which in turn coincide , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : find ] ) , with those of a thermal state . concretely we obtain for those relative fluctuations , see [ derfin ] , [ eq : fluc ] , which is indeed very small due to the large multiplicity of the bath @xmath115 for energies @xmath116 . off - diagonal elements are considered separately , as detailed in [ derfin ] , but it turns out that the variance to their vanishing mean also scales as @xmath117 .",
    "thus , for a unitary drawn at random all elements of a typical final system state @xmath113 are @xmath117 close to the average thermal state if the bath is large .",
    "the entire above reasoning is along the lines of what has become known as `` quantum typicality '' @xcite .",
    "having realised that optimal work extraction can result in a multitude of final states , with typical state being close to the thermal state , one may wonder why it is not possible to extract more work in those rare instances where the final state happens to be fairly different from the thermal state . here",
    "it is important to note that the final state need not to be factorized between system and bath ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : find ] ) only describes the diagonal part ) .",
    "indeed , it is known @xcite that only a negligible set of the final states will be factorized , especially when the degeneracies of the bath @xmath13 are large . however , to repeat the same work extraction process requires an initially fully factorized state , thus preventing repetition and further work extraction along the same route for the majority cases .",
    "finally , a concern may be that one could introduce a `` fresh bath '' that is uncorrelated with the final system in order to extract even more work from a non - thermal final system state .",
    "here it is important to realise that the work extraction process with the first bath left the system not necessarily in a thermal state , but certainly in a state with full rank , @xmath113 .",
    "this is due to the fact that maximum work extraction requires a non - zero population of every dimension spanned by @xmath57 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pfine ] ) . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : perfectwork ] ) a full rank system state means that there is no potential for further `` perfect '' work extraction , i.e. moving weight population from @xmath118 with certainty ( @xmath119 ) , even if new baths are brought in .",
    "if the first work extraction process is imperfect ( @xmath120 ) , i.e. the weight ends with population in @xmath121 and @xmath122 , in general weight and system will be correlated , thus also violating the initial factorisation condition , see ( [ eq : map ] ) , for a second work extraction process .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness , suppose that the result factorises and the weight is chosen such that it has additional energy levels @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is adjusted to match @xmath126 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwork2 ] ) applied to @xmath113 .",
    "one can now indeed perform a second imperfect work extraction which may very well increase the mean energy in the weight system .",
    "however , this will lead to a weight level population of at least three of the four eigenlevels , @xmath127 .",
    "this scenario is outside of what is allowed in case ( a ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pic]a , but will be discussed as case ( b ) in section [ sec : disc ] . if , on the other hand the first work extraction process is a perfect one , weight and system necessarily factorise and a second , imperfect , work extraction can be added .",
    "this will result in overall imperfect transfer of @xmath128 to @xmath129 as a result of the total process instead of raising perfectly to @xmath130 in the first step alone .",
    "so one could have obtained the same result if one had allowed for imperfect work extraction in the first place since an increase of @xmath131 always allows for an increase of work , @xmath132 .",
    "this shows that there is no second law conflict with a final state being non - thermal .",
    "a key finding of the single shot thermodynamics approach presented in @xcite is the realisation that , in analogy to entanglement of formation and distillation , the work required to form a non - equilibrium state may differ from the work that can be extracted from that state . here",

    "this part of the appendix is dedicated to a more detailed derivation of the results on the final states discussed in section [ sec : fisysta ] .",
    "we start by denoting the projector spanned by all eigenstates of the initial state @xmath205 that have total energy @xmath47 and @xmath206 by @xmath207 .",
    "the dimension of this projector @xmath208 $ ] has already been calculated in ( [ eq : dinie ] ) . by construction",
    "it equals the dimension @xmath162 of the respective projector @xmath57 .",
    "the maximum work extraction itself simply consists in a unitary @xmath23 which maps the initial subspaces on the respective final ones , thereby respecting energy shells , which is the only condition on @xmath23 . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : fisysta ] the crucial point here is that there is obviously not a single , unique unitary that corresponds to maximum work extraction but infinitely many .",
    "since there are very many unitaries there may be potentially very many different reduced states of the system after maximum work extraction . in order to better understand the multitude of final system states",
    "it is instructive to consider unitaries which are randomly distributed according to the haar measure .",
    "( those unitaries may be constructed by drawing ( column ) vectors component - wise at random and doing a gram - schmidt orthonormalization for more details on averaging over haar distributed unitaries see @xcite ) . in the following we outline some results on distribution of quantities generated by such random unitaries without ( formal ) proof .",
    "consider the unitary mapping @xmath23 of some matrix @xmath209 and a subsequent projection onto its diagonal part w.r.t . some orthonormal basis @xmath210 , i.e. , @xmath211 .",
    "the average over all such unitaries may simply be inferred from symmetry considerations : [ units ] > = , : = _",
    "n=1^d|n   n | where @xmath108 denotes the average over all unitaries and @xmath212 is the dimension of the hilbertspace , @xmath213 $ ] . denoting the sum over @xmath214 of the diagonal elements of this operator by @xmath215",
    ", we find for the latter : [ defsum ] s:=_n=1^m n|vav^|n , we find from ( [ units ] ) for the average of @xmath215 : [ typav ] > = .",
    "it is more subtle to compute the variance of @xmath215 but it has been done , e.g. , in the context of quantum typicality @xcite . from the latter works we find : [ typvar ] ( s)^2:= > - > ^2 = , and for the relative deviation ( setting @xmath216 for simplicity ) [ reldev ] : = > - > ^2 = .",
    "thus , if @xmath217 is sufficiently large , those relative deviations become ( negligibly ) small . which means even for a single unitary drawn at random according to the haar measure @xmath215",
    "may be expected to be given by @xmath218 for the overwhelming majority of cases .",
    "equipped with these findings we may now identify the `` typical '' local reduced final state of the system @xmath12 . to this end",
    "we consider ( [ units ] ) and make the identifications : [ ascrp ] a : _ ini^e ( , ) _",
    "ini^e ( , ) , : _ fin^e , furthermore we note that [ probe ] tr[a ] = tr[_ini^e ( , ) _",
    "ini^e ( , ) ] = ( 1- ) p^e_ini .",
    "let @xmath219 be the diagonal part ( w.r.t .",
    "the product energy eigenstates of the uncoupled subsystems ) of the full system final state that has actually changed under work extraction , i.e. everything except for the @xmath131-part that remained unchanged , and @xmath220 the state s projection into the subspace of energy @xmath47 .",
    "then one finds from ( [ units ] ) , inserting ( [ ascrp ] ) and ( [ probe ] ) : [ fina ] > = .",
    "since @xmath65 is invariant under @xmath23 it may be calculated most conveniently from ( [ eq : roini ] ) . from this calculation",
    "it is found to be actually independent of @xmath47 , i.e. , the total probabilities on all energy shells are the same . using ( [ eq : pfine ] ) and ( [ eq : dfine ] ) yields [ finb ] > _ e_s_s(e_s)_b(e - e_s - w ) _",
    "w(w ) . at this point",
    "it is actually more convenient to go back to the original , local energies and sum over @xmath48 rather than @xmath221 . doing so yields : [ finc ] > _ e_s , e_b_s(e_s)e^-e_s_b(e_b - w)e^-e_b _",
    "w(w ) using the index shift @xmath222 , this may be summed as [ find ] > e^-_se^-_b _ w(w ) which is ( [ eq : find ] ) as given and discussed in section [ sec : fisysta ] .",
    "however , to conclude that the actual final state of the system @xmath12 corresponding to a single random unitary is close to @xmath223 and thus a minimum free energy state it remains to be shown that the relative deviations of @xmath219 are small . to this end",
    "it is instructive to write out the diagonal matrix elements of the reduced final system state @xmath224 $ ] explicitly [ trace ] & & e_s , g| _ s| e_s , g = _ e p_fin(e , e_s , g ) , + & & p_fin(e , e_s , g):= _ f=1^m_b(e_b)e_s , g , e , f , w| _diag| e_s , g , e , f , w , where @xmath225 are the respective ( product ) energy eigenstates of the decoupled system .",
    "so a single @xmath226 , i.e. , a contribution to the respective diagonal element of the final reduced state of @xmath12 from some energy shell @xmath47 , is itself a sum over very many diagonal elements of the full final state , as may be seen from the lower line of ( [ trace ] ) .",
    "namely , it runs over all bath energy eigenstates at @xmath227 , i.e. , contains @xmath158 summands .",
    "thus from ( [ reldev ] ) , setting @xmath228 , it may be inferred that the relative deviations of the contributions to the diagonal matrix element are on the order of [ reldevdiag ] , which is very small if the bath is large .",
    "this is ( [ eq : fluc ] ) as given and discussed in section [ sec : fisysta ] .",
    "furthermore , if the unitaries are drawn at random , the @xmath229 are independent of each other",
    ". thus one may conclude from ( [ reldevdiag ] ) and the central limit theorem , that according to the first line of ( [ trace ] ) , the relative deviations of @xmath230 will be even smaller if many energy shells are involved .    an analogous consideration ( which we do not present here in full detail for brevity ) applies to the off - diagonal elements of the final reduced state of @xmath12 .",
    "the analogue to ( [ typav ] ) required to find the average of those off - diagonal elements reads @xcite [ typavoff ] > = 0",
    "n n. thus , using the same identifications as before ( [ ascrp ] ) , on average off - diagonal elements of the full system final state vanish .",
    "since off - diagonal elements of reduced states are sums of off - diagonal elements of the full state exclusively , the averages of the final reduced state of the system @xmath113 also vanish .",
    "thus on average , the final state is indeed diagonal in its energy eigenbasis .",
    "furthermore only those ( off - diagonal ) elements of the full state for which the full system states @xmath231 both correspond to the same bath system state @xmath232 contribute to the reduced state of @xmath12 at all .",
    "thus each contribution to the reduced state of @xmath12 may be associated with a certain energy shell @xmath20 of the bath .",
    "an analogue to ( [ typvar ] ) quantifies the deviations of off - diagonal elements , [ typavoff1 ] ( o)^2:= > n n , and reads , according to e.g. @xcite , [ typavoff2 ] ( o)^2:=. from ( [ ascrp ] ) and ( [ units ] ) it may be inferred that , @xmath233 \\leq { { \\rm tr}}[{\\hat{\\pi}_{\\rm ini}}^e({\\epsilon } , \\eta)]$ ] and @xmath234 $ ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] is has been established that both traces essentially scale with the dimension of the bath , i.e. [ scale ] tr [ _ ini^e ( , ) ] m_b(e ) , tr [ _ fin^e ] m_b(e ) . thus we find [ typavoff3 ] o .",
    "where @xmath235 is a number which is independent of the overall dimension of the bath . as @xmath236",
    ", this implies that the deviations of the off - diagonal elements of the reduced state of @xmath12 again scale at most as @xmath237 , just like in the case of the diagonal elements , cf .",
    "( [ reldevdiag ] ) .",
    "this result is also given and discussed in section [ sec : fisysta ] .",
    "this part of the appendix is dedicated to the derivation of ( [ eq : ineq ] ) in sect .",
    "[ sec : multinifi ] . in the remainder",
    "any state of the total system , possibly including correlations , will be denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "reduced local states will be denoted by @xmath239 $ ] for the non - equilibrium system , @xmath240 $ ] for the weight storage system , and @xmath241 $ ] for the bath .",
    "just as before @xmath23 transforms the total initial state @xmath56 into the total final state @xmath144 which means @xmath242 . and just as before we assume conservation of the sum of local energies , i.e. , @xmath243=0 $ ] .",
    "free energies will be denoted as [ freeen ] f(x):=u(x ) - s(x):=- tr [ x x ] , where @xmath244 .",
    "thus , free energies may refer either to parts or to the total system .",
    "the expectation value of the respective energy is denoted by @xmath245 for the corresponding hamiltonian , @xmath246 .",
    "generally primed operators will refer to final states and unprimed operators to initial states .",
    "again , as also mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : multinifi ] , we assume factorizing initial conditions , i.e. , @xmath247",

    "the only difference in the set up of the approach in this section compared to sections [ sec : max]-[sec : disc ] is that we do not require the state density of the spectrum of the bath to be exponentially growing . by construction ,",
    "the total entropy and the sum of local energies are both invariant under @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the initial total free energy and the final total free energy are the same , @xmath249 , and due to the factorizing initial conditions we have [ initotloc ] f ( ) = f(_s)+f(_b)+f(_w ) . from the araki - lieb theorem @xcite",
    "it follows that [ al ] s()s(_s)+s(_b)+s(_w ) and hence , [ fineq ] f ( )f(_s)+f(_b)+f(_w ) . combining ( [ initotloc ] ) and ( [ fineq ] ) yields [ ifineqf ] f(_s)+f(_b)+f(_w ) f(_s)+f(_b)+f(_w ) which may simply be rearranged as [ rear ] f(_w)- f(_w ) - ( f(_s)- f(_s ) ) - ( f(_b)- f(_b ) ) .",
    "a thermal state has the lowest free energy given a specific inverse temperature @xmath8 .",
    "since we assumed an initial thermal state for the bath it follows that @xmath250 is the lowest possible bath free energy . consequently , whatever @xmath251 is , one has [ ineqfreebath ] -(f(_b)- f(_b ) ) 0 . by dropping the corresponding term in ( [ rear ] )",
    "we only make the r.h.s .",
