    "covered bonds are special debt instruments that are normally served by their issuer .",
    "but if the issuer defaults and is no longer able to make the payments due to the covered bonds holders , the debt service is continued on the basis of the proceeds of the assets in the pool covering the bonds .",
    "if in the case of the bond issuer s default the proceeds of the cover pool assets do not suffice for the debt service and the bond holders claims are not met by the liquidation of the assets , the bond holders still can take recourse to the remaining assets of the issuer .",
    "their claims are then pari passu with the claims of the holders of the issuer s senior unsecured debt .",
    "thus the covered bonds holders have a privileged position compared to most other of the issuer s creditors . indeed ,",
    "no loss due to missed payments was ever observed for european covered bonds @xcite .",
    "while this is good news for covered bonds investors , it makes estimation of expected loss for covered bonds difficult .",
    "covered bonds have been popular investments for a long time especially in europe . as a consequence of the recent financial crisis ,",
    "covered bonds became an even more important funding instrument for banks , as such replacing instruments like securitised products .",
    "therefore , asset encumbrance in the banks balance sheets due to the higher demand of collateral is increasing .",
    "this has led to concerns that expected loss for creditors of senior unsecured debt is also increasing @xcite .",
    "but it is not clear how to efficiently quantify this effect for the purpose of loss provisioning or stress testing .",
    "this paper draws on recent work on fitting lognormal asset value distributions to given probability of default ( pd ) and loss - given - default ( lgd ) estimates @xcite and on asset encumbrance to suggest simple and intuitive models for covered bonds that allows quantitative assessment of expected loss and the impact of asset encumbrance .",
    "we find that one - period lognormal two - assets model in some situations can not exactly be calibrated even if different time horizons for bond issuer and covered bond holders are taken into account .",
    "the proposed adjusted lognormal one - asset model represents an acceptable workaround for the calibration issues , but only as long as the credit quality fo the cover pool is only moderately better than the bond issuer s credit quality .",
    "the paper is organised as follows :    * in section  [ se : vares ] , we revisit the pd and lgd fitting observation by @xcite , proving that there is a unique solution for the two model parameters and placing the approach in the general context of the method of moments . * in section  [",
    "se : covbonds ] , we extend the lognormal one - asset model by to a lognormal two - assets model and provide formulae for efficient numerical computation of expected losses for covered bonds , senior unsecured debt and junior debt with this model .",
    "* computations for the two - assets model are straightforward when the model parameters are known .",
    "we show in section  [ se:2lognormal ] that the calibration of the parameters leads to a non - linear equation system that may have no exact solution at all . * in section  [ se:1lognormal ]",
    ", we revisit the one - asset model by .",
    "we adjust the model for portfolio heterogeneity in terms of risk by modifying the asset encumbrance ratio related to the covered bonds to reflect the expected loss of the cover pool .",
    "we show that in the case of a homogeneous portfolio the adjusted lognormal one - asset model is equivalent to a comonotonic special case of the two - assets model discussed in section  [ se : covbonds ]",
    ". unsurprisingly , therefore , exact calibration of the model again is not always possible . * in section  [ se : numerical ] , we provide some numerical examples illustrating the impact of asset dependence , of asset encumbrance , and of approximating the two - assets model with the adjusted one - asset model . * the paper concludes with some comments in section  [ se : conclusions ] .",
