    "the subject of this paper is the evolving surface cahn - hilliard ( esch ) equation @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is a smoothly evolving surface , @xmath2 is the material time derivative associated with the velocity @xmath3 of material points of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the surface gradient and laplace - beltrami operator , the function @xmath7 is the derivative of a double - well potential , and @xmath8 is a mobility function . note that @xmath9 is the variation of the ginzburg - landau energy @xmath10 and in the case @xmath11 the system , is the @xmath8-weighted @xmath12 gradient flow of .    with regards to @xmath13 we consider potentials with two stable non - degenerate minima denoted by @xmath14 which are twice continuously differentiable on an interval @xmath15 containing @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "we consider second order phase transitions such that @xmath17 .",
    "specifically , we have a quartic potential and a logarithmic potential in mind defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 are parameters , but we stress that the results are not restricted to these two cases .",
    "we assume that the mobility @xmath8 is lipschitz on @xmath20 $ ] and positive and continuously differentiable on @xmath15 ( the latter for simplicity , a slightly smaller open interval comprising @xmath16 $ ] would be sufficient ) .",
    "we have in mind the two specific mobility functions : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "let us introduce the pairings @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the former we refer to as the _ constant mobility esch equation _ and the later as the _ degenerate esch equation_.    on a stationary , flat domain the cahn - hillard equation has been introduced to model phase separation in binary alloy systems @xcite . as a prototype model for segregation of two components in a mixture",
    "it has been applied in many areas beyond materials science .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review of the equation and highlight @xcite as one example of a recent application of relevance .",
    "the field @xmath25 usually stands for the ( mass or volume ) concentration of one of the components , sometimes also their difference .",
    "cahn and hilliard motivated the logarithmic double - well potential in their original works @xcite by theories of mixing .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is the ( constant ) temperature of the system and @xmath27 is a critical temperature dependent on the material which determines the onset of phase separation . in the shallow quench limit ( @xmath28 )",
    ", the logarithmic potential can be well approximated by the quartic potentials of the form .",
    "non - constant mobilities were motivated by cahn and hilliard in the original derivation , see also @xcite . but also the case of a constant mobility has been of interest @xcite .",
    "partial differential equations describing phase separation on evolving surfaces or domains occur , for example , in de - alloying of binary alloys @xcite , in two - phase flow @xcite ( potentially with soluble surfactants @xcite ) , in pattern formation on growing organisms @xcite , or in phase separation on biomembranes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the usual notion of @xmath25 as a concentration we here take an abstract point of view choosing not to physically interpret the phase field variable .",
    "we only assume that @xmath25 is a conserved quantity for which is a mass balance on the moving surface @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 at all times @xmath30 . the essential difference to the standard cahn - hilliard equation",
    "is the @xmath31 term which accounts for local stretching if @xmath32 ( or compressing in case of the opposite sign ) .",
    "after the initial stage of separation , solutions @xmath25 to the cahn - hilliard equation exhibit large domains ( or _ phases _ ) in which @xmath25 is almost constant and close to one of the minima @xmath33 , @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "these phases are separated by moving layers with a thickness that scales with @xmath36 .",
    "this behaviour of solutions is a general feature of phase field models .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an analysis of a phase field model with regards to the different time scales at which the phase separation and the movement of the interfacial layers take place . in the latter solution regime , by using formally matched asymptotics expansions , limiting free boundary problems ( or _ sharp interface models _ ) as @xmath37 have been derived . for the cahn - hilliard equation in a stationary , flat domain ,",
    "the pairing @xmath23 has been considered by @xcite whilst @xcite have studied the pairing @xmath24 including the deep quench limit @xmath38 .",
    "the method has also been applied to elliptic equations on fixed hypersurfaces in @xcite where also the underlying surface depends on the solution and , thus , on @xmath36 . in some cases such expansions",
    "have been rigorously shown to converge , for instance , see @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is required that the resultant free boundary problem admits a smooth solution , thus imposing regularity assumptions on the initial condition . in @xcite",
    "these regularity assumptions are relaxed but with the restriction to radially symmetric solutions . regarding other approaches to assess the sharp interface limit , the @xmath12-gradient flow ( of the ginzburg - landau energy ) structure has been used in the context of @xmath39-convergence to show asymptotic convergence to the mullins - sekerka problem in @xcite for the pairing @xmath23 .",
    "however , when working with a deformable domain , without some relation coupling the surface velocity to the solution , the system not necessarily has a gradient flow structure .",
    "the general aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of the motion of the underlying domain @xmath4 . via a formal asymptotic analysis ( for instance , see @xcite ) we investigate the effects of the surface motion on the limiting problem that is obtained as @xmath37 .",
    "the methodology has been applied to surface phase field models in the stationary case where also the surface depends on @xmath36 in @xcite .",
    "we have further extended the technique so that we can deal with moving surfaces and can apply it to the esch equation . as usual , a coordinate change using the signed distance function to the limiting moving phase interface is performed in the narrow interfacial region which blows up its thickness to unit length .",
    "but since the underlying space , @xmath4 , is time dependent , the scaled distance function must take account of transport due to the surface velocity . technically , the challenge is to expand the material time derivative @xmath40 in the new coordinates .",
    "the analysis is carried out for the case of hypersurfaces in the three - dimensional space ( @xmath41 ) but the ideas should carry through to the case @xmath42 .",
    "the only difficulty should consist in dealing with several tangential coordinates along the limiting phase interface rather than one .",
    "the scaling of @xmath8 ( or rather @xmath43 ) with respect to @xmath36 turns out to be crucial when attempting to derive limiting free boundary problems . in the case of a stationary , flat domain ( @xmath11 ) it is equivalent to study the cahn - hilliard equation at different time scales as in @xcite .",
    "specific scalings have been considered in @xcite where @xmath44 and @xcite where @xmath45 .",
    "the former appears as a model for early time phase separation when the interfaces form and the latter as a long time model for interface evolution .",
    "the scaling @xmath46 appears in @xcite for the degenerate mobility in the regime of the deep quench limit , @xmath38 , of the logarithmic potential .",
    "each of these time scales has been considered in @xcite .",
    "different scales have also been discussed in @xcite in the context of a more general phase field model .",
    "we here consider a fixed time scale given by the evolution of the surface , namely one given by ( a ) a typical velocity at which the domains evolves and ( b ) a length scale given by the typical size of the surface .",
    "different scalings of @xmath43 in @xmath36 then relate to the speed at which diffusion effects are taking place in comparison with transport effects .    not for all scalings",
    "were we able to identify sensible limiting free boundary problems .",
    "if the mobility is too small , i.e. , @xmath43 is of a high order in @xmath36 , then the limiting problems do not see the long time behaviour resulting from the evolution of the phase field variable , whence the dynamics is purely governed by the transport with the given velocity field @xmath47 .",
    "if the mobility is too high so that @xmath43 is of a low ( negative ) order in @xmath36 then the asymptotic limits are forced towards equilibrium states with respect to the phases which are barely affected by the transport .    in the interesting intermediate case",
    "in which @xmath45 we obtain the following general limiting free boundary problem : @xmath48^+_- & = & 0 \\\\ w(t ) & = & s \\kappa_\\lambda(t ) \\\\",

    "this fact causes problems when attempting to pass to the deep quench limit @xmath38 for the degenerate esch equation . in that limit the degenerate mobility switches off the elliptic equation in the bulk . on a stationary domain a purely geometric equation",
    "is obtained in the sharp interface limit , namely surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "but in the present case a non - trivial term persists in the bulk if @xmath58 , and there is no mechanism to account for the mass density changes due to this local stretching or compressing .",
    "we present our findings as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the notation that we use throughout our analysis , discussing the notions of surface calculus as well as how we handle curves on evolving surfaces . in section 3 we present our assumptions for performing an asymptotic analysis on an evolving surface .",
    "in particular we discuss the necessary expansion of the material time derivative , @xmath40 , in the inner co - ordinate system . in section 4",
    "we perform the asymptotic analysis of the esch equation for the slow mobility , when @xmath45 , and interpret the results for specific mobility and potential functions . in section 5 we turn our attention to the fast mobility , when @xmath46 , and compare the result with the slow mobility .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present supporting numerical experiments for the theoretical findings and display some interesting behaviour due to a non - trivial velocity .",
