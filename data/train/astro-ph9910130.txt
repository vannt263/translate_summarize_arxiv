    "figure  [ obs ] shows the observed velocity distribution in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , based on the hipparcos input ( radial velocities ) and output ( tangential velocities ) catalogues .",
    "the distribution is characterised by several distinct streams , and in particular a stream with an asymmetric drift of @xmath3  kms@xmath4 and @xmath5 , which hereafter we will refer to as the `` herculis '' stream according to a comoving eggen group ( skuljan et al .",
    "this stream most probably has a dynamical origin because its stars are mainly older than a few gyr and present a large range of metallicities ( raboud et al .",
    "1998 ) , and is under - represented in the hipparcos sample , which is biased towards young stars .",
    "the average luminosity of stars in this sample indeed increases with distance and the sample only covers the vertical region of the galactic plane where the fraction of young stars is largest .",
    "we have realised a large 3d @xmath0-body simulation designed to evolve into realistic barred models of the milky way .",
    "the initial conditions are adapted from fux  ( 1997 ) and @xmath6 particles , allowing to compute very detailed velocity distributions in small space regions .    after the formation of the bar ( at @xmath7  gyr ) , the simulation reveals a complex velocity structure with multiple streams occuring almost everywhere in the disc .",
    "the streams , as well as the velocity dispersions , remain very time - dependent until the end of the simulation ( @xmath8  gyr ) , even within regions corotating with the bar .",
    "outside corotation and for an inclination angle of the bar @xmath9 , the simulation often displays a herculis - like stream ( figure  [ sim ] ) .",
    "the model selected here is a snapshot at @xmath10  gyr , scaled to a corotation radius of @xmath11  kpc , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the galactocentric distances of the lagrangian points @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and to a circular velocity in the azimuthally averaged potential of @xmath16  kms@xmath4 at @xmath17  kpc . in these units , @xmath18  kpc and @xmath19  kms@xmath4 at @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "our interpretation for the herculis stream follows the same lines as in raboud et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in a rotating barred potential , the value of the hamiltonian : @xmath22 where @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 is the gravitational potential and @xmath25 the pattern speed of the bar , is an integral of motion ( jacobi s integral ) .",
    "three critical values of this integral are associated with stars corotating at the lagrangian points ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and stars on circular orbits at the outer lindblad resonance in the axisymmetriesed potential ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "stars with @xmath29 follow `` hot '' orbits which are susceptible to cross the corotation radius . in the simulation , even far beyond the solar circle , a substantial fraction of particles",
    "are on such orbits and the hamiltonian distribution frequently shows a secondary peak between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( figure  [ hist ] ) . if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are measured relative to the galactic centre , equation  ( [ ham ] ) also writes : @xmath32 thus , neglecting the vertical velocity component @xmath33 , the contours of constant hamiltonian in the @xmath34 plane are circles centred on @xmath35 and of radius @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ sim ] shows that the herculis - like stream in the model falls just outside the @xmath30-contour and thus concerns particles on hot orbits .",
    "this interpretation is different from the one proposed by dehnen ( 1999 ) , who attributes the valley between the herculis stream and the hyades - pleiades branch to stars scattered off the olr . in our case , the valley is produced by the decline of the hot orbit population as @xmath38 .",
    "but in both cases the position of the olr is found near @xmath20 , in agreement with kalnajs  ( 1991 ) conclusion based on the hyades and sirius streams .",
    "figure  [ orb ] traces back in time the orbits of the particles in the herculis - like stream which were recently captured inside corotation ( using the instantaneous frozen rotating potential ) .",
    "these particles come from the low hamiltonian edge of the stream and represent about 10% of the particles in the stream .",
    "this percentage strongly depends on @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
