    "certain anisotropic molecules such as n@xmath2 , c@xmath3 , and kcn form a cubic crystal and , at lower temperatures , they undergo an orientation phase transition with a specific - heat peak @xcite , where the crystal structure changes to a noncubic one . furthermore , mixtures of anisotropic particles @xcite such as ( kcn)@xmath4(kbr)@xmath5 and one - component systems of globular molecules @xcite such as ethanol and cyclohexanol become orientation glass . in such glass , the phase ordering should occur only on small spatial scales with mesoscopically heterogeneous orientation fluctuations .",
    "because of anisotropic molecular shapes , there should be a direct ( proper ) coupling between the molecular orientations and the lattice deformations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the shear modulus becomes small around the orientational order - disorder or glass transition @xcite .",
    "these systems thus exhibit singular acoustic and plastic behaviors @xcite , but there has been no systematic experiment in the nonlinear response regime .",
    "many of these anisotropic molecules have dipolar moments also , yielding dielectric anomaly near the transition .    in metallic alloys",
    ", a structural phase transition arises from the displacements of the atoms in each unit cell from their equilibrium positions in the high - symmetry phase .",
    "some alloys undergo a martensitic phase transition gradually from a high - temperature phase to a low - temperature phase over a rather wide temperature range and , at sufficiently low temperatures , they are composed of multiple martensitic variants or domains @xcite .",
    "in particular , a system of off - stoichiometric intermetallic ti@xmath6ni@xmath7 has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "even at @xmath8 , it becomes strain glass , exhibiting the shape - memory effect and the superelasticity , where strain heterogeneities with sizes of order 10 nm were observed @xcite . as a similar example ,",
    "metallic ferroelectric glass , called relaxor , exhibits large dielectric response to applied electric field @xcite , where the electric polarization and the lattice deformations are coupled and frozen polar nanodomains are produced in the presence of the compositional disorder in the perovskite structure .    in soft matter , impurities often strongly disturb or influence phase transitions .",
    "examples of impurities are filler particles in phase - separating polymer blends @xcite , microemulsions in nematic liquid crystals @xcite , and crosslink irregularities in polymer gels @xcite . for gels , some authors developed random crosslink models @xcite .",
    "moreover , in gels with liquid crystal solvents @xcite , the isotropic - nematic phase transition is analogous to the orientation phase transition in solids , where the coupling between the molecular orientation and the elasticity leads to singular elastic behavior . in such liquid crystal gels ,",
    "nematic polydomains are produced by random crosslinkage and polydomain - monodomain transitions are induced by applied stress or electric field @xcite , as numerically studied by uchida @xcite using quenched random stress .",
    "the polydomains obviously correspond to the mesoscopic orientation heterogeneities in solids .",
    "we also mention experiments of crystal formation and glass transition using elongated colloidal particles in three dimensions @xcite and in two dimension @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic heterogeneities produced by impurities are widely recognized in various solid and soft materials .",
    "we may mention two previous approaches .",
    "one is based on a random field coupled to the order parameter @xcite . in particular , vasseur and",
    "lookman @xcite introduced a spin glass theory supplemented with the elastic interaction ( the long - range interaction among the order parameter @xmath9 mediated by the elastic deformations ) @xcite .",
    "the other is a phase - field ( ginzburg - landau ) theory with a random critical temperature and the elastic interaction @xcite , where the quadratic term ( @xmath10 ) in the free energy has a random coefficient . in these theories ,",
    "the impurities are governed by an artificial random distribution without spatial correlations .",
    "therefore , they lack microscopic physical pictures of the impurity disordering . from our viewpoint ,",
    "microscopic approaches are particularly needed when each impurity strongly perturbs the local order parameter . to perform first - principle calculations of the mesoscopic heterogeneities , we start with lennard - jones systems composed of anisotropic host particles and impurities to create orientationally disordered and ordered crystal states .",
    "( i ) in such states we may examine the degree of heterogeneities by changing the impurity composition .",
    "( ii ) we may describe a tendency of impurity clustering or aggregation @xcite , which depends on the cooling rate from liquid .",
    "it apparently governs the degree of vitrification , for example , in water containing a considerable amount of salt @xcite .",
    "( iii ) we also note that the positional disorder and the orientation disorder have been discussed separately in the literature . in this paper , they appear simultaneously , though the former is weaker than the latter .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we will present the backgrounds of our theory and simulation . in sec.iii",
    ", we will give simulation results for one - component systems of elliptic particles forming crystal to examine the orientation transition .",
    "in sec.iv , we will treat mixtures of elliptic particles and larger repulsive impurities , where the elliptic particles are aligned in the planar alignment around the impurities@xcite . in sec.v",
    ", we will examine the orientation dynamics of the elliptic particles .",
    "in sec.vi , we will treat small attractive impurities , which tend to form aggregates and solvate several elliptic particles in the homeotropic alignment@xcite .",
    "we propose a simple microscopic model of binary mixtures in two dimensions , which exhibits orientation phase transitions and glass behavior .",
    "we do not introduce the dipolar interaction supposing nonpolar molecules .      in our model , the first and second components are composed of elliptic and spherical particles , respectively .",
    "their numbers are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 in this paper .",
    "the composition is defined by c = n_2/n , which is either of 0 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , or 0.3 in this paper .",
    "thus the particles of the second component constitute impurities .",
    "the particle positions are written as @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the orientation vectors of the elliptic particles may be expressed in terms of angles @xmath16 as _",
    "i=(_i,_i ) , where @xmath17 .    the pair potential @xmath18 between particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is a truncated modified lennard - jones potential .",
    "that is , for @xmath22 it is zero , while for @xmath23 it reads u_ij = 4-c_ij . here , @xmath24 with @xmath25 . in terms of the diameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the two species , we define _",
    "= ( _ + _ ) /2 . in eq(3 ) , @xmath28 is the value of the first term at @xmath29 , ensuring the continuity of @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath30 is the characteristic interaction energy .",
    "the particle anisotropy is taken into account by the angle factors @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which depend on the relative direction @xmath33 and the orientations @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the elliptic particles .",
    "there can be a variety of their forms depending on the nature of the anisotropic interactions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume the following form , a_ij = _ 1 ( n_i)^2 + _ 1 ( n_j)^2 , where @xmath36 is the anisotropy strength of repulsion . the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is equal to 1 for @xmath39 @xmath40 ) and 0 for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "thus , in the right hand side , the first ( second ) term is nonvanishing only when @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) belongs to the first species . in sec.iv",
    ", we treat large spherical impurities repelling the elliptic particles by setting @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "the total energy is written as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the potential energy and @xmath53 is the kinetic energy , u & = & _ 1i < jnu_ij , + k & = & _ 1 in |_i|^2 + _",
    "1in_1 |_i|^2 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the masses , and @xmath58 is the moment of inertia of the first component . in this paper",

    "the second line holds for the first component ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , since we treat equilibrium or at least nearly steady states , we attach a nos@xmath64-hoover thermostat @xcite to all the particles by adding the thermostat terms in eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "unless confusion may occur , space , time , and temperature will be measured in units of @xmath65 , _ 0 = _ 1 , and @xmath66 , respectively , where @xmath67 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "stress ( and elastic moduli ) will be measured in units of @xmath68 .    from eqs.(3 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) the elliptic particles have angle - dependent diameters .",
    "let the particles @xmath43 and @xmath44 belong to the first species .",
    "then minimization of @xmath18 in eq.(3 ) with respect to @xmath69 gives @xmath70 .",
    "thus the shortest diameter @xmath71 is given for the perpendicular orientations ( @xmath72 ) , while the longest diameter @xmath73 by the parallel orientations ( @xmath74 ) so that a_s= 2 ^ 1/6_1,a_= ( 1 + 2)^1/62 ^ 1/6_1 .",

    "<S> using a modified lennard - jones model for elliptic particles and spherical impurities , we present results of molecular dynamics simulation in two dimensions . in one - component systems of elliptic particles , we find an orientation phase transition on a hexagonal lattice as the temperature @xmath0 is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> it is also a structural one because of spontaneous strain . at low @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> there arise three martensitic variants due to the underlying lattice , leading to a shape memory effect without dislocation formation . </S>",
    "<S> thermal hysteresis , a minimum of the shear modulus , and a maximum of the specific heat are also found with varying @xmath0 . with increasing the composition @xmath1 of impurities , </S>",
    "<S> the three kinds of orientation domains are finely divided , yielding orientation - strain glass with mesoscopically ordered regions still surviving . </S>",
    "<S> if the impurities are large and repulsive , planar anchoring of the elliptic particles occurs around the impurity surfaces . if they are small and attractive , homeotropic anchoring occurs . </S>",
    "<S> clustering of impurities is conspicuous . with increasing the anchoring power and/or the composition of the impurities </S>",
    "<S> , positional disorder can also be enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the rotational dynamics of the molecular orientations . </S>"
