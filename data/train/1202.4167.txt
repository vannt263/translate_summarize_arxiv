    "entem and fernndez derived a @xmath32 interaction from a constituent quark model constrained by the @xmath39 sector to investigate the possible baryonium resonant state @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "et al _ s study indicated that : ( 1 ) x(1835 ) could be the second radial excitation of @xmath35 ; ( 2 ) x(2120 ) and ( 2370 ) can be explained as the third and fourth radial excitations of @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely accepted as the fundamental theory to describe the hadron and the strong interaction and has verified in high momentum transfer process . in the low energy region , such as hadron spectroscopy and hadron - hadron interaction study , the _ ab initio _ calculation directly from qcd becomes very difficult due to the complication of nonperturbative nature .",
    "recently , lattice qcd ( lqcd ) and nonperturbative qcd method have made impressive progresses on hadron properties , even on hadron - hadron interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , qcd - inspired constituent quark model ( cqm ) is still an useful tool in obtaining physical insight for these complicated strong interaction systems .",
    "cqm can offer the most complete description of hadron properties and is probably the most successful phenomenological model of hadron structure  @xcite . in traditional cqm , a two - body interaction proportional to the color charges @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 or 2 and @xmath44 is the distance between two quarks , was introduced to phenomenologically describe quark confinement interaction .",
    "the model can automatically prevent overall color singlet multiquark states disintegrating into several color sub - systems by means of color confinement with an appropriate @xmath45 casimir constant  @xcite .",
    "the model also allows a multiquark system disintegrating into color - singlet clusters , and it leads to interacting potentials within mesonlike @xmath38 and baryonlike @xmath46 subsystems in accord with the empirically known potentials  @xcite .",
    "however , the model is known to be flawed phenomenologically because it leads to power law van der waals forces between color - singlet hadrons  @xcite .",
    "it is also flawed theoretically in that it is very implausible that the long - range static multibody potential is just a sum of the two - body ones  @xcite .",
    "the problems are related to the fact that this model does not respect local color gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "robson proposed to use many - body confinement potentials for meson - meson and baryon - baryon systems  @xcite , which contains the essential features of the solution which emerges from the flux model based on the strong coupling limit of lqcd hamiltonian and on the explicit local color gauge invariance  @xcite .",

    ", lqcd calculations on mesons , baryons , tetraquark and pentaquark states reveal flux - tube or string like structure  @xcite .",
    "the confinement of multiquark states are multibody interactions and can be simulated by a potential which proportional to the minimum of the total length of strings which connect the quarks to form a multiquark system . a naive flux - tube or string model basing on this picture has been constructed  @xcite .",
    "it takes into account of multibody confinement with harmonic interaction approximation , i.e. , where the length of string is replaced by the square of the length to simplify the numerical calculation .",
    "there are two arguments to support this approximation : one is that the spatial variations in separation of the quarks ( lengths of the string ) in different hadrons do not differ significantly , so the difference between the linear and quadratic forms is small and can be absorbed in the adjustable parameter , the stiffness .",
    "the calculations on nucleon - nucleon interactions support the argument  @xcite .",
    "the second is that we are using a nonrelativistic description of the dynamics and , as was shown long ago  @xcite , an interaction energy that varies linearly with separation between fermions in a relativistic , first order differential dynamics has a wide region in which a harmonic approximation is valid for the second order ( feynman - gell - mann ) reduction of the equations of motion .",
    "the flux tube model has been applied to the study of exotic mesons  @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the multibody confinement should be employed in the quark model study of multiquark systems instead of the additive two - body confinement .",

    "as far as baryon is concerned , the flux tube model is not a new model .",

    "<S> nonstrange hexaquark state @xmath0 spectrum is systematically studied by using the gaussian expansion method in flux tube models with a six - body confinement potential . </S>",
    "<S> all the model parameters are fixed by baryon properties , so the calculation of hexaquark state @xmath0 is parameter - free . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that some ground states of @xmath0 are stable against disintegrating into a baryon and an anti - baryon . </S>",
    "<S> the main components of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are observed in the radiative decay of @xmath3 by bes collaboration , can be described as compact hexaquark states @xmath4 and @xmath5 with quantum numbers @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these bound states should be color confinement resonances with three - dimensional configurations similar to rugby ball , however , @xmath7 can not be accommodated in this model approach . </S>"
