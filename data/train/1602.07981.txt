    "the formalism of open quantum systems , i.e. , quantum systems interacting with an environment , is a widely used concept in many areas of physics .",
    "its backbone is the separation of a large quantum system into a small system of interest and an environment , encapsulating all other degrees of freedom present in the full system .",
    "sometimes , such an approach makes it possible to derive a tractable and physically meaningful equation of motion for the small system , rather than propagating the full system in time .",
    "this concept  @xcite has become a common tool in atomic , molecular , and condensed matter systems , and also finds applications in nuclear  @xcite and particle  @xcite physics .",
    "it is further crucially important in the field of quantum information and computation , making it possible to assess the role of decoherence in quantum information protocols  @xcite .    in many physical systems ,",
    "the environment consists of a large number of degrees of freedom at finite temperature .",
    "often , such an environment exhibits a back - action onto the system , which depends on previous system dynamics . in open quantum system terms",
    ", this memory of the environment is related to the concept of ( non-)markovianity .    from a practical point of view",
    ", a memoryless ( markovian ) environment enables one to derive simple equations of motion , such as the lindblad form @xcite , that allow for an efficient numerical solution of the dynamics restricted to the small system space . for strongly coupled environments with memory ,",
    "typically sophisticated and numerically expensive methods are required . from this point of view",
    "it would be advantageous to possess so called quantum simulators @xcite that can capture such non - markovian dynamics . over the last years , several setups have been suggested with which such non - markovian quantum simulators could be realized @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose an experimentally feasible setup where markovian and non - markovian dynamics can be studied in a controlled fashion using ultracold rydberg atoms .",
    "the idea relies on the combination of two achievements , which have been reached separately in two recent experiments : coherent oscillations of a rydberg dimer due to resonant dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite and imaging of a rydberg excitation by destroying the resonance condition of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) for a background gas through van - der - waals interactions  @xcite .",
    "interfacing a coupled rydberg dimer with an optically driven background gas atom provides , on the one hand , a test bench to study the markovian to non - markovian transition , and on the other hand it might be useful in view of recent proposals to use rydberg ensembles as quantum simulators for open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "we first describe the setup in detail in section [ sec : sec2 ] , and present our numerical results with experimentally accessible parameters in section [ sec : sec3 ] . in section [ sec : sec4 ]",

    "the state configuration is chosen such that coherent rabi oscillations due to resonant dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite are enabled between the pair states @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "we now bring a third , laser - driven atom into the vicinity of the dimer .",
    "this driven atom constitutes our environment and is from now on referred to as the detector @xcite . the laser field ( probe field ) couples the ground state @xmath15 of the detector atom to some intermediate level @xmath16 , which in turn is coupled to a rydberg state @xmath17 by a second laser field ( control field ) . in the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the detector is described by the hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 denote the rabi frequencies and @xmath21 , @xmath22 the detunings of the probe- and coupling fields .",
    "as rydberg states have a very long ( though finite ) lifetime @xcite , we neglect the spontaneous decay of the state @xmath17 in our scheme .",
    "the intermediate state @xmath16 , however , is chosen to undergo radiative decay , which takes place on the time scale of the dynamics of the system . in order to account for this effect , we model the spontaneous decay with rate @xmath23 from this level by the lindblad operator @xmath24    , and the laser - driven detector atom placed in their vicinity .",

    "the presented setup provides a test bench to study controllable non - markovianity in open quantum systems .",
    "we have shown that both markovian as well as non - markovian system dynamics can be achieved by the driven - dissipative environment provided by the detector atom .",
    "besides , our analysis reveals that ( non-)markovianity of the system ( dimer ) dynamics can not be easily inferred from population dynamics alone , but rather a measure relying on the information provided by the full density matrix of the system has to be employed .",
    "our proposal represents a first step towards a non - markovian quantum simulator harnessing ultracold rydberg atoms and should be accessible by state - of - the - art experimental setups .",
    "in contrast to using the environment as a measurement device for the dimer dynamics @xcite , in our setup the single detector atom operates as gateway to the environment of electromagnetic field modes implicitly responsible for its spontaneous decay . the system dynamics can be extracted by different means @xcite .",
    "having shown the variety of markovian / non - markovian dynamics as well as dephasing time scales and steady - state values of the system in the case of a simple setup employing a single detector atom , we expect even richer tunability of the dynamics in the case of many detector atoms .",
    "this might open up new prospects for using rydberg aggregates as quantum simulators with a controlled environment ."
