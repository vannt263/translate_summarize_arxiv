    "the goal of heavy - ion collision experiments is to shed light on thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter and to determine the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "recently , experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite study of event - by - event fluctuations has attracted interest , in particular , because these fluctuations carry information about qcd thermodynamics .",
    "recent experimental data from rhic and cern sps @xcite show non - trivial pattern of fluctuations which awaits theoretical understanding .",
    "thermodynamic description of the final stage of the heavy - ion collision is motivated , to a large extent , by a remarkable phenomenological success of statistical thermal model in describing the observed particle spectra @xcite .",
    "as far as the fluctuations are concerned , the observed fluctuations are gaussian to a very good approximation , and are consistent with being largely of thermodynamic origin ( see @xcite for more quantitative analysis ) . in this paper",
    "we shall not discuss the relationship between the thermodynamic and observed fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions in detail ( in particular , we shall not discuss possible importance of non - equilibrium effects  see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at temperatures of order 120 mev characteristic of the final stage ( freezeout ) of a high - energy heavy - ion collision , hot qcd is , to a good approximation , a gas of predominantly pions interacting through exchange of resonances .",
    "this motivates the main goal of this paper : to calculate equilibrium thermodynamic fluctuations given the interaction of pions .",
    "the most interesting application of our results is the search for the critical point of qcd .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , such a point is characterized by a divergent correlation length , i.e. , a massless excitation , in the channel with the quantum numbers of the sigma meson ( scalar isoscalar ) .",
    "the strategy of the search is to scan the qcd phase diagram by varying experimental parameters , such as the energy of the collision , looking for the signatures of the critical point @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of pions are sensitive to the presence of light sigma excitation because of the direct coupling of pions and sigma : @xmath1 .",
    "thus , measuring the pion fluctuations one could determine if the freezeout is occuring near the critical point @xcite .",
    "another important application of our results is the study of charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the paper is more generic .",
    "we wish to derive a formula for the pion fluctuations , specifically , for the two - pion correlator , given the effective interactions of pions .",
    "we shall discuss in detail the effect of the interaction induced by the sigma exchange , both because of its application to the search for the critical point and because this interaction is the simplest .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to generalize the analysis and the results to interactions induced by exchanges of other resonances , such as @xmath2-meson .",
    "the goal of this paper is to motivate and derive formulas such as ( [ g2corr ] ) . as a simple example of an application of these results we determine the rapidity correlator ( [ cyy ] ) .",
    "other applications and a detailed comparison of these results to experiment are deferred to further work .",
    "most of the commonly used fluctuation measures , such as gaussian widths of event - by - event distributions of mean transverse momenta , @xmath3 , or correlation coefficients such as , e.g. , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the multiplicity fluctuation ) , can be related to the two - particle correlator , or the two - particle momentum space density , as emphasized in @xcite . for completeness , and to underline the importance of the two - particle correlator , we shall repeat some typical relationships here .",
    "an expert may wish to skip this section .",
    "let us denote by @xmath6 an average over events .",
    "let us assume that we binned the phase space into bins labeled by the values of momenta @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the occupation number of a given bin in a given event .",
    "then @xmath10 is the fluctuation , in a given event , of this occupation number around the all - event mean .",
    "the two - point fluctuation correlator which will be discussed and calculated in this paper is then given by @xmath11    for example , the event - by - event fluctuation of the mean transverse momentum is related to the correlator ( [ corr ] ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the inclusive mean transverse momentum .",
    "similarly , the correlator of @xmath14 and multiplicity fluctuations ( also known as linear correlation coefficient ) , can be expressed as @xmath15 the multiplicity fluctuation is related to ( [ corr ] ) by an obvious formula : @xmath16    it is straightforward to generalize these relationships to correlations of fluctuations of momenta or multiplicities of particles of _ different species _ , e.g. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the most interesting example is the charge fluctuation , @xmath19 , which can be expressed via a correlator such as ( [ mastercorr ] ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the charge of the particle labeled @xmath22 .",
    "the correlator ( [ corr ] ) also equals @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath24 is the two - particle momentum space density , one can see that the absence of correlations , i.e. , @xmath25 translates into @xmath26 in the literature such trivial fluctuations are termed `` statistical '' . for example , with ( [ triv ] ) : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc .",
    "corrections to ( [ triv ] ) are commonly termed `` dynamical '' fluctuations . in this paper",
    "we shall calculate corrections to ( [ triv ] ) due to interactions .",
    "the relationships of the type ( [ dpt2])-([dn2 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) demonstrate that the correlator ( [ corr ] ) is a very universal quantity .",
    "our goal is to calculate the universal fluctuation correlator which we define as @xmath29 where @xmath6 denotes the average over a thermodynamic ensemble , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the occupation number for a particle of type @xmath22 in the momentum mode @xmath7 . in view of experimental applications we shall focus on charged pions , i.e , @xmath32 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    in the ideal bose gas",
    "this correlator is given by a well - known formula @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is equilibrium bose - einstein distribution function .",
    "( [ freecorr ] ) simply means that occupation numbers in two different modes are uncorrelated and in each mode the mean square variance is as in the poisson distribution , @xmath35 , times the bose enhancement factor , @xmath36 . without the bose enhancement factor the correlator is just the trivial correlator ( [ triv ] ) .",
    "the corrections due to bose enhancement , significant in the region of @xmath37 and @xmath38 very close to each other , are the subject of hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry studies and will not be discussed here ( see , e.g. , @xcite for review ) .",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath39 in the r.h.s . of ( [ freecorr ] )",
    "is the first derivative of @xmath40 : @xmath41      we wish to find the effect of the interaction on the correlator ( [ mastercorr ] ) .",
    "once the interaction is turned on we must carefully rethink the meaning of @xmath42 .",
    "the spectrum is no longer a direct superposition of the single - particle spectra , i.e. , the energy of a level is not just @xmath43 . in other words ,",
    "the scattering now makes occupation numbers of individual momentum modes bad quantum numbers  they are not conserved .",
    "however , if the changes in the spectrum are controllably small , we may be able to trace the shifted levels to their original position in the free gas and assign their quantum numbers correspondingly .",
    "we shall see below how this qualitative picture works in the lowest non - trivial order in the interaction .",
    "such an `` adiabatic '' definition of the occupation numbers would correspond to a situation in which the interaction ( i.e. , scattering ) in a thermalized system is turned off at a point in time , the momenta are thus frozen , and the particles are allowed to stream freely into a detector surrounding the system .",
    "such a situation can be considered as a model of freezeout in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "such a picture relies on the weakness of the interaction and , presumably , it can not be pushed beyond the leading order calculation systematically .",
    "however , we would like to apply it to the gas of rather strongly interacting particles ( such as pions ) .",
    "we shall argue that some of the contributions of interactions can be absorbed into self - energy , or vertex type renormalizations .",
    "we then assume , unfortunately without a proof , that the resulting effective interactions , _ to lowest order _ , would be sufficient to determine the correlator to a satisfactory ( from experimental point of view ) precision , in the same way as a tree level effective lagrangian describes strong interaction amplitudes .",
    "although our motivation requires us to make such an assumption , in the remainder of this section we shall simply concentrate on performing a formal lowest order calculation , assuming that coupling constant can be made controllably small .",
    "we shall return to the discussion of applicability of our results again .      in summary , this is the strategy .",
    "the energy of a level , descendent from a free level with occupation numbers given by a set @xmath44 is @xmath45=\\sum_\\p n_\\p \\omega_\\p + \\delta e[\\{n_\\p\\}]$ ] , where @xmath46 is a correction which depends , in principle , on all @xmath42 .",
    "once we know the spectrum @xmath45 $ ] we can determine the joint probability distribution @xmath47)$ ] for the sets @xmath44 and thus calculate correlators such as ( [ mastercorr ] )",
    ". becomes singular in the leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "this fact we shall observe in our calculation . ]",
    "rather than pushing forward along these lines , we shall , instead , begin by a more familiar calculation of the free energy of the interacting gas using perturbative expansion .",
    "we shall see that this calculation can be mapped onto the scheme outlined above .",
    "we consider a theory with two charged pions @xmath17 and @xmath18 of mass @xmath48 and a scalar field @xmath49 of mass @xmath50 , with the interaction controlled by a coupling @xmath51 and given by the lagrangian @xmath52 we shall only concentrate on the effect of this simple interaction .",
    "it will then be rather straightforward to include other fields and their interactions .    to order @xmath53 , the correction to the free energy",
    "is given by the two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "we write the corresponding expressions using the mixed time - momentum representation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for the propagators : @xmath54 in this representation the integral over the time @xmath55 separation of the vertices in these diagrams is trivial .",
    "the result can be written as :    [ f2 ] @xmath56 @xmath57 , % \\left\\ { % { 1\\over\\omega_\\p+\\omega_\\k+\\tilde\\omega_\\q } % \\left[(1+f_\\p ) % \\right ] % \\right\\}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the first expression , @xmath60 , is straightforward , while for @xmath61 we introduced shorthand notations : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and analogous notations for @xmath66 s . to elucidate the expression ( [ f2b ] ) , we write one term from the 8 terms in the sum over sets @xmath67 explicitly .",
    "the term @xmath68\\ ] ] corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "the meaning of this term is simple .",
    "it is the ensemble average of the second order perturbative correction to the energy , since to leading order @xmath70 the sum @xmath71 in ( [ term ] ) is the energy denominator .",
    "the term exhibited in ( [ term ] ) comes from the virtual intermediate state @xmath72 , which has three extra particles @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath49 , relative to a given state @xmath73 .",
    "all terms in ( [ f2b ] ) correspond to virtual transitions generated by @xmath74 .",
    "there are 8 variants : a state with either one more _ or _ one fewer @xmath49 ( @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) , _ and _ either one more @xmath17 _ or _ one fewer @xmath18 ( @xmath77 ) , _ and _ either one more @xmath18 _ or _ one fewer @xmath17 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the first , simpler , diagram , @xmath60 , describes the contribution of the virtual states with one more / fewer @xmath49 , and unchanged numbers of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we see that the energy of a given state characterized by a set of occupation numbers @xmath73 , receives a @xmath53 correction @xmath79 $ ] , which is a function(al ) of the occupation numbers @xmath80 in the unperturbed state .",
    "thus , at least up to order @xmath53 , we can view the energy @xmath81 of a given state as a function(al ) of the occupation numbers in this state .",
    "this allows us to evaluate thermodynamic averages such as ( [ mastercorr ] ) .      at zeroth order ( i.e. , in the free theory ) , since @xmath82 is linear in @xmath42 , @xmath83 factorizes into gibbs distributions for individual momentum modes , and the correlator is given by ( [ freecorr ] ) .",
    "however , the correction @xmath84)$ ] does not factorize , introducing correlations between occupation numbers of different modes .",
    "one can derive simple rules which allow to read off the correlator directly from the expression for the free energy . to facilitate this ,",
    "one can introduce `` chemical potentials '' for relevant occupation numbers , shifting the energy @xmath85 $ ] by @xmath86 . differentiating resulting @xmath87-dependent free energy with respect to @xmath88 and @xmath89 we obtain correlators such as ( [ mastercorr ] ) . in the zeroth order this , of course ,",

    "these diagrams represent @xmath98 self - energy type corrections @xmath99 to @xmath100 multiplied by a factor @xmath101 . since at zeroth order the correlator is @xmath102 ( [ freecorr ] )",
    ", one can see that such diagrams are accounted for when we replace @xmath100 by @xmath103 in @xmath104 .",
    "we shall not study the effects of such self - energy contributions on the correlator or on the single - particle distributions @xmath105 .",

    "[ fig : tsu ] .",
    "in this paper we considered pion gas in thermal equilibrium as an idealization of the final ( freezeout ) stage of a heavy - ion collision .",
    "we considered the effect of pion interaction on the fluctuation correlator ( [ corr ] ) or ( [ mastercorr ] )  an important universal quantity characterizing pion fluctuations .",
    "( [ g2corr ] ) gives the lowest order correction to the correlator ( [ mastercorr ] ) due to the interaction mediated by the exchange of @xmath49-resonance and given by the lagrangian ( [ li ] ) .",
    "our main motivation to consider such an interaction is the search for signatures of the critical point on the qcd phase diagram , the point where the sigma mass vanishes .",
    "one can see that the first term in ( [ g2corr ] ) , the one due to the sigma exchange in @xmath117-channel , dominates in the limit @xmath120 .",
    "this term has been already calculated in @xcite using a different method .",
    "the advantage of the diagrammatic approach of this paper is that it allows one to obtain other terms ( due to @xmath118- and @xmath119-channel exchange ) , subleading in the regime @xmath120 .    strictly speaking",
    ", we have calculated the correction to the correlator only in the leading order of perturbative expansion .",
    "thus , our results are only rigorous in the limit of small coupling constant .",
    "our motivation , however , has been the calculation of a two - particle correlator in hot qcd , which , at temperatures of around 120 mev , characterizing the freezeout stage of the heavy - ion collisions , is primarily a gas of pions , whose interactions are not controllably small .",
    "we observed that , at the leading order , some of the contributions could be naturally absorbed into the self - energy renormalizations .",
    "we thus conjectured that if one uses an _ effective _ ( rather than bare ) interaction in ( [ li ] ) and effective self - energies , our leading order calculation could be sufficient in practice .    below",
    "we make several comments and outline some questions and problems , related to the result",
    "( [ g2corr ] ) and its comparison to experimental data . more detailed study of these questions is left to further work .",

    "@xmath122 one obtains the contribution of the @xmath2-exchange in the @xmath117-channel in the form @xmath123 two notable differences from the similar @xmath117-exchange contribution of @xmath49 in ( [ g2corr ] ) are worth a notice .",
    "both are due to @xmath2 being a _ vector _ particle .",
    "first , there is an _ angular _ correlation between the pions due to the @xmath124 factor .",
    "second , the sign of the correlation now depends on the relative sign of the two pions , due to a minus in @xmath125 .",
    "similar formulas can be derived for other resonance - mediated interactions of pions .",
    "it should be clear that the contribution of the @xmath117-exchange of @xmath49-meson is dominant when @xmath126 , i.e. , near the critical point .",
    "it can be further distinguished from other resonance contributions , such as @xmath2 , by its charge - independent character ( @xmath127 for all @xmath114 ) .",
    "most importantly , this contribution will show a non - monotonic behavior if the critical point is approached and then passed during the scan of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "it is important to realize the difference between the result ( [ g2corr ] ) and a more common approach to the correlations due to resonance _ decays _",
    "after freezeout @xcite .",
    "it is easiest to see this difference in the charge dependence of the correlator ( [ g2corr ] ) .",
    "the term which has the same charge dependence as the contribution of the resonance decays is the one due to @xmath118-channel exchange : @xmath49 , or @xmath128 , decays into @xmath129 , therefore the correlator must be proportional to @xmath130 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath117 and @xmath119 channel exchanges is entirely different . in order to compare to experiment",
    ", however , one has to take into account the fact that the _ detected _ pions consist to a large extent ( more than a half ) of the products of resonance decays .",
    "the contribution of such _ resonance _ pions to the correlator should be calculated separately , using the kinematics of the resonance decays .",
    "such a calculation has been done numerically , e.g. , in @xcite for @xmath14 fluctuations , where the effect turned out to be small , except for the contribution of the decay of light @xmath49 meson near the critical point , and in @xcite for charge fluctuations , where the effect is of order 20 - 30% .",
    "the emphasis of this paper is on the correlation induced by virtual resonance exchange among the _ direct _ pions",
    ".      generalization to heavier resonances , such as @xmath2 , presents another problem .",
    "if we consider @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that their invariant mass is equal to @xmath50 , the second term in ( [ g2corr ] ) becomes infinite ( the @xmath118-channel resonance is on mass shell ) .",
    "the perturbative expansion breaks down . with a @xmath129 pair ,",
    "are degenerate in this case .",
    "] however , we know that there is no true pole singularity in this case , since the resonance has a finite lifetime .",
    "thus one would expect that careful treatment of higher order terms should remove this pole divergence and replace it with a smooth breit - wigner - type curve .",
    "perhaps , it will also allow to treat resonance exchange and decay within the same formalism ( cf .",
    "previous subsection ) .",

    "propagator . ]      in this paper we considered an isotropic pion gas ( a fireball ) at rest . before one could compare our results to fluctuations observed in heavy - ion collisions it is necessary to take into account the effect of expansion . in this paper",
    "we shall only consider longitudinal expansion .",
    "it can be taken into account using bjorken s boost - invariant hydrodynamic model . in this approximation , one considers a superposition of fireballs placed continuously over large ( ideally infinite ) rapidity interval . in order to obtain the correlator in this case one needs to take the correlator for a gas at rest @xmath132 , boost momenta @xmath37 and @xmath38 with rapidity @xmath133 : @xmath134 and integrate over @xmath133 : @xmath135 the factors @xmath100 , @xmath136 appear because of the non - uniform density of modes in rapidity space , i.e. , @xmath137 ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) .    as a practical example",
    ", one can use formula ( [ long ] ) to determine the form of rapidity correlations . for this purpose",
    "one needs to fix rapidities @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and integrate over transverse components @xmath142 and @xmath143 : @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath146 , is such that @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 is the density of pairs per unit rapidity squared . using expression ( [ long ] ) in ( [ cyy ] ) one finds , of course , that correlator @xmath150 is a function of @xmath151 only .",
    "the dependence on @xmath151 can be found substituting ( [ g2corr ] ) for @xmath132 in ( [ long ] ) .",
    "the detailed form of the correlator depends on the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath50 , @xmath152 . a rather robust feature of @xmath153 , however , is that it vanishes exponentially with increasing @xmath154 on the scale of 1 - 2 units .",
    "this is because of the fast exponential falloff of the occupation number factors @xmath155 in ( [ g2corr ] ) when either @xmath37 or @xmath38 becomes large compared to @xmath156 . as an example , the contribution to the rapidity correlator from the @xmath117-channel exchange term only , i.e. , first term in ( [ g2corr ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] .    another interesting consequence of ( [ g2corr ] ) is a specific dependence on multiplicity @xmath157 .",
    "for example , the centrality dependence of the freezeout parameters is known to be rather weak . neglecting it",
