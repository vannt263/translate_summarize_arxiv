    "the simultaneous presence of strong frustration and large quantum fluctuations in highly frustrated and strongly correlated quantum antiferromagnets on two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices makes these systems of huge theoretical interest for investigating possible novel quantum phases with exotic ordering.@xcite particular interest has focussed on the zero - temperature ( @xmath18 ) phase transitions that can occur between both quasiclassical states showing various forms of magnetic order and magnetically disordered , quantum paramagnetic ( qp ) phases , as some control parameter characterizing the degree of frustration present in the system , is varied .",
    "the latter qp phases include both various types of valence - bond crystalline ( vbc ) solid and quantum spin - liquid ( qsl ) states .",
    "since quantum fluctuations tend to be the largest , other things being equal , for spins with the smallest spin quantum number @xmath19 , spin-1/2 systems always occupy a special niche .",
    "furthermore , novel quantum phases often emerge from the corresponding classical ( @xmath20 ) models that exhibit an infinitely degenerate family of ground states in some region of the classical @xmath18 phase diagram .",
    "what one typically finds in such a scenario is that this ( accidental ) classical ground - state ( gs ) degeneracy may be lifted entirely ( or partially ) , by the well - known _",
    "order by disorder _",
    "mechanism,@xcite to favor just one ( or a few ) particular member(s ) of the family as the actual quantum gs phase .",
    "this is often found to be the case in the quasiclassical limit ( @xmath21 ) , where one works to keep quantum corrections to leading order in the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "however , what is also often then found in those situations is that for the @xmath0 system _ none _ of the infinitely degenerate set of classical states that form the gs phase in the @xmath8 limit survive the quantum fluctuations to form a stable magnetically ordered gs phase over part , or even all , of the @xmath18 quantum phase diagram . instead , in their place",
    ", emerges one or more novel qp phases with no classical counterpart .",
    "an example of a 2d spin system that fulfills the above scenario is the anisotropic planar pyrochlore ( app ) model ( also known as the crossed chain model ) .",
    "it comprises a frustrated @xmath1@xmath2 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) on the 2d checkerboard lattice with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) exchange bonds of strength @xmath3 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "it differs from the full @xmath1@xmath2 model on the 2d square lattice by having half of the nnn @xmath2 bonds removed , such that alternate squares have zero or two @xmath2 bonds , resulting in a checkerboard pattern .",
    "it may thus be regarded as a 2d analog of a three - dimensional anisotropic pyrochlore model of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "since the @xmath18 phase diagram of the @xmath0 app model is thus of considerable interest , much attention has been paid to it , using a large variety of theoretical techniques.@xcite despite this huge effort , the structure of its full phase diagram has remained unsettled , at least until very recently , particularly in the regime of large values of the frustration parameter , @xmath24 , which is precisely where the gs phase of the classical ( @xmath20 ) version of the model is infinitely degenerate .",
    "for example , in the limit @xmath25 the app model reduces to one of essentially decoupled one - dimensional ( 1d ) crossed isotropic haf chains .",
    "it hence exhibits in that limit a luttinger qsl gs phase , with a gapless excitation spectrum of deconfined spin-1/2 spinons .",
    "it might be supposed ( as was argued in ref .  )",
    "that this luttinger - liquid behavior is robust against the gradual turning on of interchain ( @xmath1 ) couplings , so that the 2d system continues to act as a quasi-1d luttinger liquid for large but finite values of @xmath26 .",
    "such a 2d qsl gs phase is an example of what has been called a sliding luttinger liquid ( sll).@xcite    some putative numerical evidence for such a sll phase in the app model at large values of @xmath26 was claimed in exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies@xcite on small finite - sized lattices of up to @xmath27 spins .",
    "a more detailed and more careful analysis@xcite of the relevant terms near the 1d luttinger liquid fixed point showed , however , that the earlier prediction@xcite of a sll gs phase was incorrect , and the same authors@xcite suggested that an alternate possible gs phase in the large-@xmath26 regime might be the gapped crossed - dimer valence - bond crystalline ( cdvbc ) state , with twofold spontaneous symmetry breaking and without any magnetic order .    a high - order , and numerically very accurate , application of the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) ( see , e.g. , refs .  [ ] and references cited therein ) to the spin-1/2 app model indeed showed@xcite that the quasiclassical antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state with nel ordering is the gs phase for @xmath28 , but that the quantum fluctuations totally destroy the order in _ all _ of the infinitely degenerate set of afm states that form the gs phase ( for @xmath24 ) in the classical ( @xmath8 ) case . instead , it was found@xcite that for @xmath29 there are two stable qp phases in different regimes of @xmath26 , each with different types of vbc order . for @xmath30 the stable gs phase",
    "was found to have plaquette valence - bond crystalline ( pvbc ) order , whereas for _ all _ values @xmath31 it has crossed - dimer valence - bond crystalline ( cdvbc ) order .",
    "the latter cdvbc state has a staggered ordering of dimers along each of the two sets of crossed @xmath2 chains , and hence has twofold spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the ccm has also been applied with considerable success to a large variety of other spin - lattice models ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references cited therein ) with different types of both quasiclassical magnetic order and qp order .",
    "these include models that generalize the @xmath1@xmath2 model on the 2d square lattice by introducing both spatial lattice anisotropy@xcite and spin anisotropy,@xcite as well as several models that fall in the same half - depleted @xmath1@xmath2 class as the app model in the sense that they are all obtained from the full @xmath1@xmath2 model on the 2d square lattice by removing half of the @xmath2 bonds in different arrangements .",
    "examples of this depleted @xmath1@xmath2 square - lattice class are the ( @xmath1@xmath32 or ) interpolating square - triangle afm model@xcite and the so - called union jack model.@xcite    with respect to an underlying square - lattice geometry the former , interpolating square - triangle haf , model contains both nn ( @xmath1 ) bonds and competing nnn ( @xmath33 ) bonds across only one of the diagonals of each square plaquette , the same diagonal in every square .",
    "each site of the lattice is thus six - connected .",
    "considered on an equivalent triangular - lattice geometry this model may be regarded as having two sorts of nn bonds , with @xmath32 bonds along parallel chains and @xmath1 bonds providing an interchain coupling , such that each triangular plaquette thus contains two @xmath1 bonds and one @xmath32 bond . by comparison",
    ", in the union jack model each square plaquette also has only one nnn ( @xmath2 ) bond , but with neighboring plaquettes now having the @xmath2 bond across opposite diagonals .",
    "the bonds are thus arranged so that on the @xmath34 unit cell they form the pattern of the union jack flag , and alternating sites on the square lattice are thus four - connected and eight - connected .",
    "the corresponding gs phase diagrams of both the spin-1/2 interpolating square - triangle and the union jack haf models are very different both from each other and from that of the full @xmath1@xmath2 square - lattice haf model .",
    "they _ both _ also differ markedly from that of the spin-1/2 app model , despite the fact that both the interpolating square - triangle and app models reduce to uncoupled 1d chains in the @xmath25 limit .",
    "presumably the large-@xmath26 difference in phase structure has to do with the fact that whereas the gs phase of the classical ( @xmath8 ) version of the app model is infinitely degenerate after nel order has been destroyed by the effects of frustration , this is not so for either of the latter models .",
    "there is also another member of the same half - depleted @xmath1@xmath2 class of square - lattice models , which we refer to here as the chevron - square lattice model , that has largely been ignored up to now . once again",
    ", each square plaquette contains only one @xmath2 bond , but now in a chevron pattern such that neighboring square plaquettes along one of the two square - lattice axis directions ( say , rows ) have the @xmath2 bond on the same diagonal , whereas along the perpendicular direction ( say , columns ) neighboring plaquettes have @xmath2 bonds along opposite diagonals . in our convention",
    "the chevron lattice is henceforth drawn as in fig .",
    "[ model_bonds ] such that the basic chevron stripes of alternating v - shapes and inverted v - shapes are oriented vertically .",
    "hence the square plaquettes along each row have the diagonal @xmath2 bond oriented in the same direction , and with that direction alternating between neighboring rows . on the chevron lattice",
    "each site is thus six - connected , as in the app and interpolating square - triangle haf models .    in view of the fact that other depleted @xmath1@xmath2 models on the square lattice show such a rich variety of gs phase diagrams",
    ", the chevron - square lattice model now seems to be well worth studying theoretically too for the case @xmath0 .",
    "the recent experimental quantum simulation of frustrated magnetism in triangular optical lattices,@xcite which exploited the motional degrees of freedom of ultracold atoms , provides a clear additional impetus for such studies .",
    "in the experimental simulation@xcite a specific modulation of the optical lattice was used to tune the nn couplings on the triangular lattice in different directions independently . by introducing a fast oscillation of the lattice",
    "the experimentalists were thus able to simulate our previous interpolating square - triangle afm model.@xcite since , as we discuss below in sec .",
    "[ model_sec ] , the @xmath1@xmath2 chevron - square lattice model may also equivalently be regarded as a different form of anisotropic triangular - lattice haf , it is conceivable that this model too may be experimentally realizable with ultracold atoms trapped on a 2d triangular optical lattice .    in sec .",
    "[ model_sec ] we describe the model itself further , including its classical ( @xmath8 ) counterpart .",
    "the key elements of the ccm technique that we will apply to the @xmath0 model are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ ccm_sec ] , before presenting our results in sec .",
    "[ results_sec ] .",
    "we end with a brief summary in sec .",
    "[ summary_sec ] .",
    "in this paper we study the chevron - square lattice model whose hamiltonian may be written as @xmath35 where the operators @xmath36 ) are the quantum spin operators on lattice site @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "we are interested here in the extreme quantum case @xmath0 . on the square lattice",
    "the sum over @xmath39 runs over all distinct nn bonds ( with exchange coupling strength @xmath1 ) , while the sum over @xmath40 runs over only half of the distinct nnn diagonal bonds ( with exchange coupling strength @xmath2 ) . in the latter sum",
    "only one nnn diagonal bond is retained in each square plaquette , as arranged in the ( vertical ) chevron pattern shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ model_bonds ] .",
    "the primitive unit cell is thus of size @xmath41 . in both sums in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) each bond is counted once and once only . in the present paper",
    "we consider the case where both sorts of bonds are afm in nature , @xmath3 and @xmath42 , and hence act to frustrate one another . henceforth , we put @xmath43 to set the overall energy scale .",
    "the model may clearly equivalently be defined on a triangular - lattice geometry in which every site has six nn sites , four connected to it by @xmath1 bonds and two connected to it by @xmath2 bonds , as shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ triangle_geom ] .",
    "thus , the chevron - square lattice model may be regarded also as an anisotropic haf on a triangular lattice , in which every basic triangular plaquette contains two nn @xmath1 bonds and one nn @xmath2 bond in the pattern shown .",
    "it thus clearly shares some properties with our previous interpolating square - triangle model@xcite in the sense that both models interpolate smoothly between the haf on the square lattice ( when the nnn bonds retained on the square lattice are removed entirely ) and the haf on the triangular lattice ( when both nn and the retained nnn bonds on the square lattice have equal strength ) .",
    "both models can be regarded too as anisotropic triangular - lattice haf models . whereas our former interpolating square - triangle model@xcite had",
    "the nn bonds along two of the three equivalent triangular - lattice directions equal ( @xmath1 ) and different along the third direction ( @xmath32 ) , in the current chevron - lattice model the inequivalent ( @xmath2 ) bonds are those along parallel zigzag ( or chevron ) chains in one of the three equivalent directions for the triangular lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ triangle_geom ] .",
    "the current model clearly also reduces to decoupled 1d chains in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the case @xmath44 corresponds to weakly coupled 1d chains , and the model thus also interpolates between 1d and 2d limits .    before considering the extreme quantum limit @xmath0",
    "it is worthwhile to examine first the classical limit , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , it is easy to show that the classical chevron - square lattice model has only two gs phases . for @xmath45",
    "the stable gs phase has afm nel ordering on the square lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ model_bonds](a ) . at @xmath46",
    "the system undergoes a continuous second - order phase transition to a state with noncollinear spiral order that persists for all values @xmath47 . the spin direction in this spiral state , shown in fig .",
    "[ model_bonds](b ) , at lattice site ( @xmath48 ) points at an angle @xmath49\\alpha$ ] , where @xmath50 is defined to be zero if @xmath51 is even and one if @xmath51 is odd .",
    "the gs energy per spin in this classical spiral state is thus given by @xmath52 which is minimized when @xmath53    the pitch angle @xmath54 thus measures the deviation from nel order , and its classical value is @xmath55 it varies from zero for @xmath56 to @xmath57 as @xmath25 ( as shown later in fig .",
    "[ angle_vs_j2 ] ) . at the isotropic point , @xmath58 , we regain the classical three - sublattice ordering of the isotopic triangular - lattice haf with @xmath59 .",
    "the gs energy per spin of the classical model is thus given by @xmath60 equation ( [ eq_e_classical ] ) clearly shows that the classical phase transition at @xmath61 is a continuous ( second - order ) one , where both the gs energy and its first derivative with respect to the frustration parameter @xmath26 are continuous .    in the limit of large",
    "@xmath26 the gs configuration of the classical chevron - square lattice model represents a set of decoupled 1d haf chains ( along the chevrons of the model ) with sites connected by @xmath2 bonds , and with a relative spin orientation approaching @xmath62 between sites on neighbouring chevrons . in this classical @xmath63 limit",
    "there is , however , also complete degeneracy between all states for which the relative ordering directions of spins on different haf chevron chains is arbitrary .",
    "clearly the spin-1/2 model also similarly reduces in the @xmath25 limit to a set of decoupled 1d haf chevron chains , which exhibit the 1d luttinger - liquid behavior described by the exact bethe ansatz solution.@xcite    in general quantum fluctuations tend to favor states with collinear spin order over ones with noncollinear order , and it thus seems possible that at sufficiently large ( but finite ) values of @xmath26 the classical spiral order will be destroyed by quantum fluctuations in the spin-1/2 model of interest here , to yield a state with collinear spin ordering . in this case",
    "the probable ordering is thus clearly one with all of the 1d chevron chains exhibiting nel ordering in the same direction , with spins alternating in orientation ( say , up and down ) .",
    "we note that there is still an infinite family of such states in which , for example , all of the spins along a given row ( in our convention ) can be assigned arbitrarily to be either up or down .",
    "all of these states are degenerate in energy at the classical level , with an energy per spin given @xmath64 .",
    "they include , for example , the three states shown in figs .  [ model_bonds](c ) , [ model_bonds](d ) , and [ model_bonds](e ) in which , respectively , the spins in a given row all have the same orientation ( e.g. , @xmath65 ) , alternate in orientation ( e.g. , @xmath66 ) , and alternate in orientation in a pairwise fashion ( e.g. , @xmath67 ) .",
    "henceforth , we refer to these three states respectively as the row - striped state ( or state r ) , the columnar - striped state ( or state c ) , and the doubled alternating striped state ( or state d ) .    clearly , from eq .",
    "( [ eq_e_classical ] ) , the classical spiral state ( or state s ) always has lower energy than this classical infinitely - degenerate family of collinear afm states .",
    "hence , unlike in the classical app model , where the corresponding infinitely - degenerate family of crossed 1d haf chains _ does _ form the stable gs phase for _ all _ values @xmath24 , this family never becomes the stable gs phase for the classical chevron - lattice model except in the @xmath63 limit .",
    "nevertheless , as we have already suggested , it does form a likely candidate for the stable gs phase of the @xmath0 version of the model considered below , as we discuss further in sec .",
    "[ results_sec ] . in this case",
    "we also expect that the ( accidental ) classical degeneracy might again be lifted by the _ order by disorder _ mechanism .",
    "the ccm@xcite that we use here has become one of the most powerful and most universally applicable techniques of modern microscopic quantum many - body theory . in recent times",
    "it has been applied with great success to a large variety of quantum spin - lattice systems ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references cited therein ) . in particular , for 2d models of quantum magnetism , it now provides one of the most accurate methods available for their study .",
    "some of its most notable strengths are that it provides a systematic way to study various candidate gs phases and their regions of stability , and that in each case the description is systematically improvable in terms of well - defined hierarchies of approximations to incorporate more and more of the multispin configurations present in the exact , fully correlated , gs wave function .",
    "the ccm formalism is now briefly presented .",
    "we concentrate on its key ingredients only , as needed for present purposes , and refer the interested reader to the extensive literature on the method ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) for further details .",
    "any implementation of the ccm always begins with the selection of some suitable ( normalized ) model ( or reference ) state @xmath68 . for spin - lattice models",
    "this is often conveniently chosen as a classical state , which may or may not form the actual gs phase of the classical ( @xmath8 ) version of the model in some region of the @xmath18 parameter space . for the present chevron - square lattice model we will present below in sec.[results_sec ] results based on all five of the states shown in fig .",
    "[ model_bonds ] as ccm model states , for reasons already outlined in sec .",
    "[ model_sec ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively the exact gs ket and bra wave functions of the fully interacting system under study , where the normalizations are chosen so that @xmath71 .",
    "the ccm now uses the exponential parametrizations @xmath72 to incorporate explicitly the multispin - flip configurations in @xmath69 and @xmath70 above and beyond those contained in the chosen model state @xmath68 .",
    "the ket- and bra - state correlation operators are then expressed as @xmath73 where , by definition , @xmath74 is the identity operator , and @xmath75 . the set - index @xmath76 represents a multispin - flip configuration with respect to state @xmath68 , as we elaborate further below .",
    "the operator @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) thus represents a multispin - flip creation operator with respect to @xmath68 considered as a generalized vacuum state .",
    "it is now convenient to choose a set of local coordinate frames in spin space defined for each model state separately , such that on each lattice site the spin aligns along the negative @xmath79 axis ( downwards ) .",
    "such rotations obviously leave the basic su(2 ) spin commutation relations unchanged .",
    "in such a basis the @xmath77 operators now have the universal form , @xmath80 in terms of the usual single - spin raising operators @xmath81 . for a spin",
    "@xmath19 the raising operator @xmath82 may be applied a maximum of 2@xmath19 times on a given site @xmath51 , and hence the set - index @xmath83 where any given site - index @xmath84 may appear a maximum of 2@xmath19 times . in the present @xmath0 case",
    "therefore , no index may be repeated .",
    "the ket- and bra - state coefficients @xmath85 , which from eqs .",
    "( [ expon_parametration ] ) and ( [ correlation_operator ] ) completely specify the gs wave function , may now be obtained by minimizing the gs energy functional , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the hamiltonian of the system , with respect to all of the coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 separately , @xmath90 .",
    "use of eqs .",
    "( [ expon_parametration ] ) and ( [ correlation_operator ] ) then leads simply to the respective coupled sets of equations @xmath91 and @xmath92{\\rm    e}^{s}|\\phi\\rangle = 0 ; \\forall i \\neq 0 $ ] , which are fully equivalent to the gs ket and bra schrdinger equations @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the latter set of equations may equivalently be written as @xmath95 .",
    "once these sets of ccm equations have been solved for the sets of correlation coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath96 , all gs quantities may now be calculated in terms of them .",
    "the gs energy is unique in that its evaluation requires only the ket - state coefficients , @xmath97 , whereas any other gs quantity requires the bra - state coefficients also . for present purposes , for example",
    ", we will also calculate the magnetic order parameter , defined to be the local average on - site magnetization , @xmath98 , in the rotated spin coordinates , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the number of lattice sites . a key feature of the ccm exponential parametrizations of eq .  ( [ expon_parametration ] )",
    "is that the method automatically satisfies the goldstone linked cluster theorem , even when truncations are made in the multispin configurations @xmath76 retained in eq .",
    "( [ correlation_operator ] ) .",
    "thus , the method is automatically size - extensive at every level of approximation , and we may take the infinite - lattice limit , @xmath101 , from the very outset . similarly , the method also satisfies the hellmann - feynman theorem at all levels of truncation .",
    "it is important to note too that while the ccm equations are intrinsically nonlinear , due to the presence of the basic correlation operator @xmath102 in the exponentiated form @xmath103 , it only ever appears in the equations to be solved in the similarity transform , @xmath104 , of the hamiltonian . by making use of the well - known nested commutator expansion for @xmath104",
    ", it is readily seen that the basic su(2 ) spin commutation relations imply that the otherwise infinite series of nested commutators actually terminates _ exactly _ at second - order terms in @xmath102 for hamiltonians of the form of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) used here ( and see , e.g. , refs .   for further details ) .",
    "a similar exact termination generally also applies to the evaluation of the gs expectation value of any operator , such as @xmath98 above , that we calculate .",
    "thus , the ccm formalism is exact if all multispin - flip configurations are included in the index - set @xmath76 , and the equations that we need to solve in practice are coupled sets of multinomial equations for the coefficients @xmath89 and linear equations for the coefficients @xmath88 , in which the solutions for @xmath89 are needed as input .",
    "of course , in practice we need to make finite - size truncations in the multispin - flip configurations retained in the indices @xmath76 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the nel phase has a high susceptibility to pvbc ordering , although @xmath258 only at a single value which is very close to our previous best estimate for @xmath128 . while the row - striped state , on the other hand , is clearly much less susceptible to pvbc ordering , the corresponding lsub@xmath171 estimate for @xmath256 again becomes very close to zero at a value @xmath223 , which is again compatible with our previous estimates for @xmath237 .",
    "presumably , if we were also to perform calculations for @xmath256 for the spiral phase , it too would be nonzero ( and positive ) everywhere except at the values @xmath128 and @xmath237 .",
    "however , such calculations for the spiral phase are computationally very expensive , and as noted previously can be performed only for relatively lower lsub@xmath105 orders of approximation . even for the collinear row - striped state",
    "the number @xmath106 of fundamental spin configurations included in our ccm calculation at the lsub10 level is 2160176 .",
    "while the results shown in fig .  [ plaqxcpty ] corroborate our previous estimates for the qcps at @xmath128 ( at which nel order yields to spiral order ) and @xmath237 ( at which spiral order ceases ) , they essentially add nothing new .",
    "thus , it is clear that the pvbc state can not be the stable gs phase for any range of values @xmath31 , since @xmath256 does not vanish over any finite range in this regime .",
    "the fact that @xmath256 vanishes at individual points ( viz . , @xmath128 and @xmath237 here ) is simply a reflection of these being actual qcps .",
    "thus , at a qcp we expect that the system will indeed become infinitely susceptible to _ all _ forms of ordering ( or , at least , those which are compatible with the symmetries of the actual and trial states ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the two dvbc states of figs.[x_patterns](b ) and ( c ) as possible gs phases for @xmath259 .",
    "firstly , since our results for the inverse susceptibility , @xmath260 , for @xmath240dvbc ordering are qualitatively very similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ plaqxcpty ] for pvbc ordering , we do not show them .",
    "again , we find that using the nel model state @xmath261 vanishes at a single point , which is itself completely compatible with our previous estimates for @xmath128 , and using the row - striped model state @xmath261 vanishes at a single point compatible with our previous estimates for @xmath237 . thus , again , the @xmath240dvbc state is excluded as a stable gs phase in any range @xmath31 .    by contrast ,",
    "our results for the inverse susceptibility , @xmath262 , for @xmath239dvbc ordering , shown in fig.[dimer_parallel_xcpty](a ) are qualitatively quite different in the regime @xmath31 . in the inset to fig.[dimer_parallel_xcpty](a ) we show the raw lsub@xmath105 results for @xmath224 using both the nel and row - striped states as ccm model states , while in the main figure we show several lsub@xmath171 extrapolations based on both eqs .",
    "( [ extrapo_dbonds ] ) and ( [ extrapo_inv - chi-2 ] ) , and using various lsub@xmath105 data sets for the fitting procedure .    in fig .",
    "[ dimer_parallel_xcpty](b ) we also show the fitted values for the exponent @xmath116 in the corresponding extrapolation schemes .    in the first place we find that on the nel side all of the extrapolations yield almost identical results , with @xmath263 at values @xmath264 , which are in agreement with all previous estimates .",
    "secondly , however , we now see from fig.[dimer_parallel_xcpty](a ) that using the row - striped state as ccm model state , all of our extrapolations yield the result that @xmath265 is zero ( or very close to zero ) for _ all _ values @xmath266 .",
    "we thus now have very strong evidence indeed that for @xmath259 , the gs spiral ordering present for @xmath267 gives way to @xmath239dvbc ordering as the stable gs configuration .",
    "figure [ dimer_parallel_xcpty](b ) shows that when @xmath268 is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ extrapo_dbonds ] ) as the extrapolation scheme the fitted exponent @xmath116 is very close to the expected value 2 for a very wide range of values of @xmath26 , as in our standard gs energy scheme of eq .",
    "( [ e_extrapo ] ) , except for values of @xmath26 close to @xmath237 , where it drops . in practice",
    "we calculate the second derivative of @xmath269 in eq.([eq_x ] ) numerically using values @xmath270 , typically with @xmath271 , and the value of @xmath116 plotted in fig.[dimer_parallel_xcpty](b ) is essentially identical for these three values of @xmath272 used .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath262 is calculated using eq.([extrapo_inv - chi-2 ] ) , the fitted exponent @xmath116 is seen to lie very close to the value 0.75 for a very wide range of values of @xmath26 , except for values close to @xmath237 where it rises rapidly .",
    "interestingly , this same value of 0.75 was also observed previously for the spin-1/2 @xmath1@xmath2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the 2d checkerboard lattice ( viz .",
    ", the app model),@xcite when using a similar state as ccm model state in a region where the order parameter for that state was zero everywhere , and where a corresponding dvbc state also provided the stable gs configuration .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath18 gs phase diagram of an @xmath0 @xmath1@xmath2 haf on a chevron - square lattice , the classical ( @xmath141 ) version of which has only two gs phases , viz . , a nel phase for @xmath273 , and a spirally - ordered phase for @xmath274 .",
    "the model interpolates continuously between 2d hafs on the square ( @xmath165 ) and triangular ( @xmath6 ) lattices , and also extrapolates in the @xmath25 limit to uncoupled 1d haf chains .",
    "we found , as expected , that the quantum fluctuations present in the @xmath0 model tend to stabilize the collinear nel - ordered state , which is well established as the gs phase for the square - lattice haf , to larger values of the frustration parameter @xmath26 than in the classical case .",
    "we found a first qcp at @xmath275 at which the nel order gives way to spiral order .",
    "the pitch angle @xmath129 of the spiral phase ( that measures the deviation from nel order corresponding to @xmath126 ) was found to increase markedly more rapidly as @xmath26 is increased beyond @xmath128 than in the classical version as @xmath26 is increased beyond @xmath276 .",
    "although the transition at @xmath277 appears still to be a continuous ( second - order ) one , just as for the classical model at @xmath160 , we can not from our results rule out a weakly first - order transition at which the pitch angle @xmath129 undergoes a discontinuous jump from a value of zero ( nel order ) for @xmath127 to a nonzero value ( spiral order ) infinitesimally above @xmath128 .",
    "the angle @xmath129 becomes exactly @xmath278 at all levels of ccm lsub@xmath105 approximation at @xmath6 , corresponding to the exact three - sublattice relative @xmath16 spin ordering that is well established as the gs phase for the spin-1/2 triangular - lattice haf .    at still higher values of the frustration parameter , @xmath24",
    ", we found that the pitch angle @xmath129 of the @xmath0 model approaches the limiting value of @xmath62 ( which corresponds to nel afm ordering along the 1d chevron chains of @xmath2 bonds ) much faster than in the classical ( @xmath8 ) model . in turn",
    "this led us to consider other possible collinear phases in this regime , which never form the stable gs phase in the classical case , except in the precise @xmath25 limit , but which comprise an infinitely degenerate family of states corresponding to nel ordering along the 1d chevron chains .",
    "we found that the _ order by disorder _",
    "mechanism distinguishes one such state from the rest , so that quantum fluctuations in the @xmath0 case favor it to lie lowest in energy .",
    "furthermore , above some value of the frustration parameter , @xmath31 , this state was seen to become lower in energy too than the spiral state for the @xmath0 model . however , when we then calculated its magnetic order parameter , we found it to be zero , within very small numerical error bars , everywhere .",
    "we were thus led to the conclusion that the spiral order in the @xmath0 model does not persist for all values @xmath279 , but only for a finite range @xmath280 , unlike in the classical model where it persists for _ all _ values @xmath150 .",
    "instead , we found again that the magnetic order parameter of the spiral phase seems to vanish for values of @xmath26 above a certain critical value , which is itself consistent within small errors bars with the energy crossing point of the spiral state with the nonclassical collinear state mentioned .",
    "since this latter collinear state itself has a vanishing magnetic order parameter in the same region , as already noted , it must itself yield to a state with different ordering . by comparison with other related depleted @xmath1@xmath2 models ,",
    "we were led to consider that this collinear state might be susceptible to some form of vbc ordering , and we therefore calculated its susceptibility to both pvbc ordering and two forms of dvbc ordering . from among these we found unequivocal evidence that there is a second qcp in the @xmath0 model at a value @xmath281",
    "at which the spiral order present for @xmath235 melts and gives way for values @xmath31 to a parallel - dimer vbc ( @xmath239dvbc ) order .    in conclusion , the @xmath1@xmath2 haf on the chevron - square lattice has been found to provide a rich gs phase diagram for the extreme quantum case , @xmath0 .",
    "it would certainly be interesting , therefore , both to confirm our results using other theoretical methods and to examine the corresponding @xmath282 version of the model .",
    "we thank the university of minnesota supercomputing institute for digital simulation and advanced computation for the grant of supercomputing facilities , on which we relied heavily for the numerical calculations reported here .",
