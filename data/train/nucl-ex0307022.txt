    "the motivation for ultra - relativistic heavy - ion experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory is the study of nuclear matter at extremely high temperature and energy density with the hope of creating and detecting deconfined matter consisting of quarks and gluons  the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "lattice qcd calculations  @xcite predict that the transition to a deconfined state occurs at a critical temperature @xmath14  170  mev and an energy density @xmath15 2  gev/@xmath16 . based on the bjorken estimation  @xcite and the measurement of transverse energy ( @xmath17 ) in au+au collisions at @xmath4  =  130  gev  @xcite and 200  gev , the spatial energy density in central au+au collisions at rhic is believed to be high enough to create such deconfined matter in a laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions may evolve through the following scenario : pre - equilibrium , thermal ( or chemical ) equilibrium of partons , possible formation of qgp or a qgp - hadron gas mixed state , a gas of hot interacting hadrons , and finally , a freeze - out state when the produced hadrons no longer strongly interact with each other .",
    "since produced hadrons carry information about the collision dynamics and the entire space - time evolution of the system from the initial to the final stage of collisions , a precise measure of the transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) distributions and yields of identified hadrons as a function of collision geometry is essential for the understanding of the dynamics and properties of the created matter .    in the low @xmath7 region ( @xmath18  2  gev/@xmath6 ) , hydrodynamic models  @xcite that include radial flow",
    "successfully describe the measured @xmath7 distributions in au+au collisions at @xmath4  =  130  gev  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 spectra of identified charged hadrons below @xmath19  2  gev/@xmath6 in central collisions have been well reproduced by two simple parameters : transverse flow velocity @xmath20 and freeze - out temperature @xmath21  @xcite under the assumption of thermalization with longitudinal and transverse flow  @xcite . the particle production in this @xmath7 region",
    "is considered to be dominated by secondary interactions among produced hadrons and participating nucleons in the reaction zone .",
    "another model which successfully describes the particle abundances at low @xmath7 is the statistical thermal model  @xcite .",
    "particle ratios have been shown to be well reproduced by two parameters : a baryon chemical potential @xmath22 and a chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath23 .",
    "it is found that there is an overall good agreement between measured particle ratios at @xmath4  =  130  gev au+au and the thermal model calculations  @xcite .    on the other hand , at high @xmath7 ( @xmath24  4  gev/@xmath6 )",
    "the dominant particle production mechanism is the hard scattering described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , which produces particles from the fragmentation of energetic partons .",
    "one of the most interesting observations at rhic is that the yield of high @xmath7 neutral pions and non - identified charged hadrons in central au+au collisions at rhic are below the expectation of the scaling with the number of nucleon - nucleon binary collisions , @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this effect could be a consequence of the energy loss suffered by partons moving through deconfined matter  @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the yield of neutral pions is more strongly suppressed than that for non - identified charged hadrons  @xcite in central au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "another interesting feature is that the proton and anti - proton yields in central events are comparable to that of pions at @xmath19 2  gev/@xmath6  @xcite , differing from the expectation of pqcd .",
    "these observations suggest that a detailed study of particle composition at intermediate @xmath7 ( @xmath26  2  4  gev/@xmath6 ) is very important to understand hadron production and collision dynamics at rhic .",
    "the phenix experiment  @xcite has a unique hadron identification capability in a broad momentum range .",
    "pions and kaons are identified up to 3  gev/@xmath6 and 2  gev/@xmath6 in @xmath7 , respectively , and protons and anti - protons can be identified up to 4.5  gev/@xmath6 by using a high resolution time - of - flight detector  @xcite .",
    "neutral pions are reconstructed via @xmath27 up to @xmath19  10  gev/@xmath6 through an invariant mass analysis of @xmath28 pairs detected in an electro - magnetic calorimeter ( emcal )  @xcite with wide azimuthal coverage . during the measurements of au+au collisions at @xmath4  =  200  gev in year 2001 at rhic ,",
    "the phenix experiment accumulated enough events to address the above issues at intermediate @xmath7 as well as the particle production at low @xmath7 with precise centrality dependences . in this paper , we present the centrality dependence of @xmath7 spectra , @xmath29 , yields , and ratios for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in au+au collisions at @xmath4  =  200  gev at mid - rapidity measured by the phenix experiment",
    ". we also present results on the scaling behavior of charged hadrons compared with results of @xmath30 measurements  @xcite , which have been published separately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : phenix ] describes the phenix detector used in this analysis . in section  [ sec : analysis ] the analysis details including event selection , track selection , particle identification , and corrections applied to the data are described .",
    "the systematic errors on the measurements are also discussed in this section . for the experimental results ,",
    "centrality dependence of @xmath7 spectra for identified charged particles are presented in section  [ sec : pt_spectra ] , and transverse mass spectra are given in section  [ sec : mt_spectra ] .",
    "particle yields and mean transverse momenta as a function of centrality are presented in section  [ sec : meanpt_dndy ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "ratio ] the systematic study of particle ratios as a function @xmath7 and centrality are presented .",
    "section  [ sec : ncoll ] studies the scaling behavior of identified charged hadrons .",
    "a summary is given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the phenix experiment is composed of two central arms , two forward muon arms , and three global detectors .",
    "the east and west central arms are placed at zero rapidity and designed to detect electrons , photons and charged hadrons .",
    "the north and south forward muon arms have full azimuthal coverage and are designed to detect muons .",
    "the global detectors measure the start time , vertex , and multiplicity of the interactions .",
    "the following sections describe the parts of the detector that are used in the present analysis . a detailed description of the complete detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .      in order to characterize the centrality of au+au collisions , zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc )",
    "@xcite and beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite are employed .",
    "the zero - degree calorimeters are small hadronic calorimeters which measure the energy carried by spectator neutrons .",
    "they are placed 18  m up- and downstream of the interaction point along the beam line .",
    "each zdc consists of three modules .",
    "each module has a depth of 2 hadronic interaction lengths and is read out by a single photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "both time and amplitude are digitized for each pmt along with the analog sum of the three pmt signals for each zdc .",
    "two sets of beam - beam counters are placed 1.44 m from the nominal interaction point along the beam line ( one on each side ) .",
    "each counter consists of 64 @xmath31erenkov telescopes , arranged radially around the beam line .",
    "the bbc measures the number of charged particles in the pseudo - rapidity region 3.0  @xmath18  @xmath32  @xmath18  3.9 .",
    "the correlation between bbc charge sum and zdc total energy is used for centrality determination .",
    "the bbc also provides a collision vertex position and start time information for time - of - flight measurement .",
    "charged particles are tracked using the central arm spectrometers  @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer on the east side of the phenix detector ( east arm ) contains the following subsystems used in this analysis : drift chamber ( dc ) , pad chamber ( pc ) and time - of - flight ( tof ) .",
    "the drift chambers are the closest tracking detectors to the beam line  at a radial distance of 2.2  m. they measure charged particle trajectories in the azimuthal direction to determine the transverse momentum of each particle . by combining the polar angle information from the first layer of the pc with the transverse momentum ,",
    "the total momentum @xmath2 is determined .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath33 ( gev/@xmath6 ) , where the first term is due to the multiple scattering before the dc and the second term is the angular resolution of the dc .",
    "the momentum scale is known to 0.7% , from the reconstructed proton mass using the tof .",
    "the pad chambers are multi - wire proportional chambers that form three separate layers of the central tracking system . the first pad chamber layer ( pc1 )",
    "is located at the radial outer edge of each drift chamber at a distance of 2.49  m , while the third layer ( pc3 ) is 4.98  m from the interaction point . the second layer ( pc2 )",
    "is located at a radial distance of 4.19  m in the west arm only .",
    "pc1 and the dc , along with the vertex position measured by the bbc , are used in the global track reconstruction to determine the polar angle of each charged track .",
    "the time - of - flight detector serves as the primary particle identification device for charged hadrons by measuring the stop time . the start time is given by the bbc .",
    "the tof wall is located at a radial distance of 5.06  m from the interaction point in the east central arm .",
    "this contains 960 scintillator slats oriented along the azimuthal direction .",
    "it is designed to cover @xmath34 and @xmath35 in azimuthal angle .",
    "the intrinsic timing resolution is @xmath36 ps , which allows for a 3@xmath37 @xmath38 separation up to @xmath39  gev/@xmath6 , and 3@xmath37 @xmath40 separation up to @xmath41  gev/@xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we describe the event and track selection , charged particle identification and various corrections , including geometrical acceptance , particle decay , multiple scattering and absorption effects , detector occupancy corrections and weak decay contributions from @xmath42 and @xmath43 to proton and anti - proton spectra .",
    "the estimations of systematic uncertainties on the measurements are addressed at the end of this section .          for the present analysis",
    ", we use the phenix minimum bias trigger events , which are determined by a coincidence between north and south bbc signals .",
    "we also require a collision vertex within @xmath44 30  cm from the center of the spectrometer .",
    "the collision vertex resolution determined by the bbc is about 6  mm in au+au collisions in minimum bias events  @xcite .",
    "the phenix minimum bias trigger events include @xmath45% of the 6.9 barn au+au total inelastic cross section  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bbc_zdc ] shows the correlation between the bbc charge sum and zdc total energy for au+au at @xmath4  =  200  gev .",
    "the lines on the plot indicate the centrality definition in the analysis . for the centrality determination ,",
    "these events are subdivided into 11 bins using the bbc and zdc correlation : 05% , 510% , 1015% , 1520% , 2030% , ... , 7080% and 8092% .",
    "due to the statistical limitations in the peripheral events , we also use the 6092% centrality bin as the most peripheral bin .",
    "after event selection , we analyze 2.02@xmath46 minimum bias events , which represents @xmath5 140 times more events than used in our published au+au data at 130  gev  @xcite . based on a glauber model calculation",
    "@xcite we use two global quantities to characterize the event centrality : the average number of participants @xmath47 and the average number of collisions @xmath48 associated with each centrality bin ( table  [ tab : ncoll ] ) .",
    ".the average nuclear overlap function ( @xmath49 ) , the number of nucleon - nucleon binary collisions ( @xmath48 ) , and the number of participant nucleons ( @xmath47 ) obtained from a glauber monte carlo  @xcite correlated with the bbc and zdc response for au+au at @xmath4  =  200  gev as a function of centrality .",
    "centrality is expressed as percentiles of @xmath50 = 6.9 barn with 0% representing the most central collisions .",
