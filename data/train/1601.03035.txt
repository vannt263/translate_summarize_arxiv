    "studied the effect of radiation pressure on the internal structure of static , dusty regions , finding that radiation pressure acting on gas and dust gives rise to a non - uniform density profile with density ( and gas pressure ) increasing outward . in this section , we revisit to obtain the parametric dependence of various region properties on the strength of ionizing radiation .",
    "this information will be used for our dynamical models in section [ s : exp ] .",
    "let us consider a central point source with luminosity @xmath28 embedded in a cloud , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 refer to the luminosities of hydrogen ionizing and non - ionizing photons , respectively .",
    "the number of ionizing photons per unit time emitted from the source is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mean photon energy above the lyman limit . for simplicity",

    "do not possess a cavity ( , @xcite ) . ]",
    "note that although @xmath70 in the cavity , the gas density there is too small to attenuate radiation significantly .",
    "consequently , the radiation force exerted on the gas is almost negligible in the central cavity and rises only in the outer parts of the region , as figure  [ f : dr11](b ) illustrates .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ e : dr-3 ] ) shows that @xmath71 achieves its maximum at the position of the steepest density gradient ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , radiation strongly modifies the interior of the regions such that both gas and radiation forces are applied primarily in the outer portion .    figure  [ f : dr11_param ] plots the dependence on @xmath72 of @xmath73 , @xmath36 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the mean density .",

    "the saturation of @xmath77 and @xmath36 occurs because the radiation - induced ionized shell near @xmath66 has such large density that neutral hydrogen produced by recombinations can compete with dust in absorbing ionizing photons .",
    "this is in contrast to the classical case of uniform - density regions without radiation pressure , for which @xmath84 , @xmath85 as @xmath86 @xcite . since the ionized shell has a saturated column @xmath87 , the gas mass @xmath88 within a dusty region in this limit depends on @xmath89 as @xmath90 , as opposed to classical regions for which @xmath91 and @xmath92 for given @xmath93 .",
    "the high pressure in the interior of an region compared to the ambient levels leads to radial expansion .",
    "@xcite provides approximate solutions for this expansion in the case where just gas pressure is included , under the assumption that ambient gas is swept up into a thin shell surrounding the ionized interior ( see also @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "we explore expansion of spherically - symmetric , dusty regions driven by both thermal and radiation pressures , making a thin - shell approximation . here",
    "we ignore pressure resulting from diffuse recombination radiation , which is negligible in comparison to gas pressure ( e.g. , @xcite ; ) .",

    "the overpressured , ionized gas creates a shock front that moves radially outward , sweeping up the ambient neutral medium into a dense shell .",
    "we assume that the region remains in internal quasi - static equilibrium throughout its dynamical expansion , which is reasonable since the sound - crossing time over the ionized region is sufficiently small compared to the expansion timescale .",
    "we further assume that all of the swept - up gas resides in a thin shell of mass @xmath102 located at @xmath103 . since we are interested in the evolution of the shell well after the formation phase , we may take @xmath104 in describing shell expansion in a power - law envelope .",
    "the momentum equation for the shell is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the expansion velocity of the shell , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 denote the outward and inward forces acting on the shell , respectively .",

    "the thrust term would be important in driving expansion of classical , blister - type regions for which ionization fronts are kept d - critical ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "we also ignore the slowdown of the shell caused by turbulent ram pressure of the external , neutral medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is difficult to model within our spherically - symmetric , one - dimensional model .",

    "this should _ not _ be interpreted as an indication that radiation is unimportant for the shell expansion .",
    "rather , the effect of the radiation force is indirectly communicated to the shell by increasing the ionized gas density @xmath115 above @xmath69 , with the limiting ratio @xmath74 given by the factor in equation   when @xmath83 .",

    "assuming that all the photons from the source are absorbed by the shell , that the region has uniform interior density @xmath69 , and that infrared photons re - radiated by dust freely escape the system , the effective outward forces on the shell from direct radiation and gas pressure are taken as @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively , where @xmath69 is given in terms of @xmath93 , @xmath36 , and @xmath118 using equation  .",

    "evidently , @xmath120 agrees well ( within 20% ) with @xmath107 from equation .",

    "@xcite estimated star formation efficiency of galactic star forming complexes by matching a wmap sample of luminous free - free sources to host gmcs with typical mass @xmath335 and typical surface density @xmath336 , finding @xmath337 on average , for the luminosity limited samples ( see his figure 2 ) .",

    "they found the average star formation efficiency of 3% . while these observations are roughly consistent with our results , the data need to be interpreted with caution , because of selection bias @xcite , neglect of extended emission @xcite , difficulty in identifying the boundary of a cloud that is being destroyed , and uncertainties involved in lifetime of stellar tracers .",
    "also , it is important to distinguish between net star formation efficiency @xmath3 and observational estimates of `` current '' star formation efficiency , the latter of which does not allow for the gas inflow / outflow experienced in the past as well as future star formation before cloud destruction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this work showed that the usual trapping factor based on the dust optical depth overestimates the radiation momentum deposition rate by a factor of @xmath341@xmath342 , in part due to matter - radiation anticorrelation , and in part due to the cancellation of radiation forces where sources are distributed rather than centrally concentrated .",
    "@xcite also showed that reprocessed radiation is able to limit collapse only when the opacity is large , @xmath343 . here",
    ", we also find that reprocessing only significantly affects the minimum efficiency when @xmath24 is large .",
    "while in this paper we exclusively focus on the effects of region expansion , diverse feedback mechanisms with different degrees of importance are believed to operate in star - forming environments (; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , outflows and jets from protostars feed turbulent motions within cluster - forming clumps , prevent global collapse , and reduce star formation efficiency therein ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are a dominant source of momentum injection before massive stars form , but are unlikely to be capable of destroying the intermediate - mass and massive clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "supernova explosions are regarded as the most powerful feedback mechanism for driving turbulence in the ism @xcite , providing vertical pressure support against gravity and regulating the star formation rates in galactic disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "supernovae may also significantly impact or destroy molecular clouds if they are not dispersed by other feedback processes during the lifetime of massive cluster stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of mixed - morphology supernova remnants suggest that this is often the case ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , thermal pressure of hot gas created by shocked stellar winds is thought to dominate expansion of ionized bubbles @xcite .",
    "the pressure of hot gas trapped within the region would push the inner boundary of the region outward , indirectly doing mechanical work on the swept - up shell . a semi - analytic spherical model by @xcite",
    "suggests that shocked wind pressure is more important than radiation pressure in driving region expansion . however , observed @xmath344-ray luminosity is lower than the theoretical prediction of hot confined gas , casting doubt on the effectiveness of stellar winds in controlling the dynamics of gas around star clusters @xcite .",
    "estimates of wind energy lost via various mechanisms suggest that leakage of hot gas through holes in the shell and/or turbulent mixing at hot  cold interfaces can explain the observed low luminosity @xcite . the approximate calculation by shows that a shocked wind brings only a modest increase in effective outward force on a porous shell , with a wind trapping factor of order unity .",
    "the star formation efficiencies we present here are the minimum for disruption solely by dynamical expansion of an region , but other feedback process could reduce @xmath0 .",
    "we now comment on caveats of the present study in various aspects .",
    "first , we have assumed that the ionizing luminosity remains constant during the shell expansion . for most clouds ,",
    "this is acceptable as the expansion time @xmath251 is shorter than @xmath345 , a typical main - sequence lifetime of ionizing stars @xcite . for clouds located in the lower right corner in the @xmath26@xmath27 plane ( figure  [ f : tr ] ) , however , the ionizing output may experience a significant drop before cloud disruption . with a decrease in the outward force , the shell expansion would be slowed down and possibly fall back due to gravity , implying that higher @xmath0 is required than in our models .",
    "second , while we assume spherical symmetry , expanding shells may be subject to various non - radial instabilities such as ionization front instability @xcite , rayleigh - taylor instability , and vishniac instability @xcite in the early phase , and gravitational instability assisted by external pressure in the late phase @xcite . at the nonlinear stage",
    ", the shell may break up into pieces and create holes through which photons and ionized gas can leak out , reducing feedback efficiency .",
    "moreover , any shell that forms in an inhomogeneous cloud would itself be inhomogeneous , such that acceleration would be nonuniform ( see below ) .",
    "third , our model considers a situation where the shell expansion is driven solely by a single embedded region , as in @xcite and . in reality , however , star formation in a molecular cloud may be distributed spatially with a population of subclusters @xcite .",
    "this results in expanding regions of various sizes interacting with each other . in early stage of expansion",
    ", the momentum injection by individual subclusters may not simply add up to the total due to cancelation ; this effect is evident in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "but once a main shell created by the most luminous region expands to a volume large compared to that of most ionizing sources ( assuming some degree of subcluster concentration within the cloud ) , the effective radiation source is the same as for a single central cluster .",
    "more importantly , we have ignored blister - type regions that can effectively vent ionized gas through low density regions . since real turbulent clouds have a log - normal density distribution characterized by many clumps and holes , even an initially fully embedded region is likely to transform into blister - type .",
    "the analytic model of @xcite in which all regions are taken to be blister - type showed that photoevaporative mass loss from small subclusters ( dominated by those around turnover in the cluster luminosity function ( @xcite ) ) alone can limit star formation efficiency of galactic gmcs to below @xmath346 , with the photodestruction time scale decreasing as a function of the cloud mass .",
    "when both mass loss mechanisms are considered , dynamical disruption by shell expansion is more frequent than photodestruction alone , but significant photoevaporative mass loss also occurs prior to disruption if clouds survive for several free - fall times @xcite .",
    "however , these analyses of photoevaporation did not allow for the reduced surface area that gas confined in dense filaments presents to radiation , which tends to reduce photoevaporation . indeed",
    ", @xcite found that less than 10% of the gas is photoionized in their simulations .",
    "the reduced effective area of clumpy clouds also reduces radiation forces @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of the mass loss mechanisms in inhomogeneous clouds is difficult to assess and would require numerical simulations ( but see @xcite ) .    in inhomogeneous turbulent clouds , gas dispersal would take place in a gradual , rather than impulsive , fashion .",
    "both analytic and numerical investigations of radiation - only feedback models show that broad distributions of surface density and/or radiation flux cause locally low - column , super - eddington gas parcels to be ejected from the system early on , while higher surface density parcels are ejected only later , when the total luminosity of stars has increased .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the blue shaded region in figure  [ f : sfe_krho ] shows the range of net star formation efficiency of turbulent clouds with width of lognormal surface density distribution in the range @xmath347 , predicted from the analytic model of @xcite ( see their equation ( 21 ) ) , which considers just radiation pressure on dust from non - ionizing radiation .",
    "stellar mass grows until there is little gas above the critical surface density , making @xmath3 increase beyond what is expected from uniform case ( lower bound ) .",
    "note also that the inclusion of gas pressure in our model is responsible for the dramatic difference in efficiency for low @xmath27 clouds .",
    "because the current models consider only uniform spherical shells of gas rather than a broadened surface density probability distribution function , we underestimate the luminosity and hence @xmath0 required to eject the denser clumps in a cloud via direct radiation forces .",
    "however , the direct photoevaporation enabled by star formation close enough to the cloud periphery would also tend to lower @xmath0 .",
    "additional star formation can also in principle be triggered in shocked shells by the collect and collapse process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to address these complex issues ,",
    "it is necessary to perform three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in a turbulent cloud with both ionizing and non - ionizing radiation .",
