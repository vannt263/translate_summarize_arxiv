    "magnetic fields ( b - fields ) play an important role in almost all stages of star formation as discussed in the comprehensive star formation review by .",
    "however , there are still many uncertainties about how b - fields regulate the protoplanetary disk formation and evolution . for example",
    ", magnetically driven core - collapse models predict an hourglass - shaped b - field geometry at early stages in the disk evolution , a scenario challenged by recent observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the only way to address these issues is with high angular resolution observations of the b - field morphologies in a variety of young disks and their environments .",
    "polarimetry is a potentially incisive observational probe of b - field morphology .",
    "dust grains can polarize light by scattering , dichroic absorption , or dichroic emission , the latter two processes attributed to non - spherical dust grains with their long axes aligned perpendicular to the b - field lines , perhaps as a result of radiative torque @xcite .",
    "dichroic absorption by aligned non - spherical dust grains can partially polarize background starlight with the transmitted e - field direction parallel to the aligning b - field lines @xcite .",
    "light scattering by spherical and non - spherical dust grains can produce high fractional polarization prominently in the optical and near - ir . at far - ir and sub - mm wavelengths ,",
    "aligned non - spherical dust grains emit polarized light with the emitted e - field direction being perpendicular to the b - field lines . in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir , 830 @xmath6 ) , the situation becomes more complicated , since the observed polarization can be a combination of dichroic absorption , emission , and/or scattering @xcite . nevertheless , mid - ir polarimetry has some distinct advantages compared to other wavelength regions : the predicted emissive polarization is much larger than that at longer wavelengths @xcite , and we can potentially disentangle both the absorptive and emissive polarization components simultaneously along the line of sight and thereby infer the three - dimensional structure of the b - fields @xcite .    herbig ae / be stars ( 1.5@xmath7m@xmath8/m@xmath9@xmath78 ) are the higher - mass counterparts to pre - main - sequence low - mass t tauri stars , with which they share some photometric and spectroscopic characteristics @xcite .",

    "key physical properties of wl 16 are given in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "no outflow and only weak 1.3 mm emission are observed for this object ( rb03 ) .",
    "because of its high extinction ( @xmath10 2530mag ) , wl 16 is undetectable in the optical but displays extended , resolved emission in the mid - ir .",
    "the most plausible interpretation of the extended emission is that it is a disk with a diameter of nearly 900 au .",
    "kinematic modeling of near - ir co vibrational overtone emission arising from the innermost region suggests that there is indeed a flat keplerian gas disk @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , whether the entire structure is an unusually large protoplanetary disk or a smaller disk associated with a remnant of the collapsing envelope is still unclear .",
    "the very extended emission is generally ascribed to a population of very small grains ( vsgs ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "the latter population is indicated by the ir spectra of wl 16 rich in pah emission features . because of their small size ( several dozens to hundreds of carbon atoms ) , pahs are dynamically well coupled to the gas and less affected by dust settling .",
    "the pahs observable in the mid - ir likely reside in the disk surface layers .",

    "however , the dust inside the disk can potentially emit polarized thermal emission that contributes to the net polarization as we see toward wl 16 . to evaluation the contribution from emissive polarization , we adopted the method present in @xcite , which showed that , in the mid - ir , the emissive and absorptive polarization components can be identified , and separated from each other , using spectral polarimetry .",

    "should there be multiple components , we would usually expect @xmath35 to change with wavelengths ( i.e. , unless the absorbing and emitting fields are at 90 ) .",
    "in addition , the value of the polarization _ p _ peaks around 10.3 @xmath6 , which is expected from the absorptive polarization of astronomical - silicate feature in this spectral region .",
    "the decomposition indicates that an absorptive - dominant polarization profile provides an excellent fit for both stars , with negligible emissive components ( less than 0.25% for both cases ) .",
    "this result strengthens our conclusion that the mid - ir polarization of wl 16 is primarily due to absorption by interstellar silicate dust .",
    "since absorption by elongated interstellar particles produces polarization parallel to the projected b - field , the direction of projected foreground magnetic field is about 33@xmath154(measured from spectral polarimetry and averaged over the entire 10-@xmath6 band ) .",
    "the observed polarizations at 10.3 @xmath6 for both wl 16 and elias 29 are proportional to their respective values of interstellar extinctions as shown in fig.[fig:6 ] . from this ratio ,",
    "we derive a value for the polarization efficiency , which is defined as the ratio of polarization percentage to the extinction @xcite , @xmath47 mag@xmath5 in table [ tab:4 ] .",

    "this value is within the 03% range derived in @xcite .",
    "we note however that the observed polarization corresponds only to the b - field component projected on the sky ( integrated along the line of sight ) , whereas the extinction depends on the total dust column density along the line of sight .",

    "we do not see any polarization features at pah emission bands ( e.g. , 8.6 and 11.2 @xmath6 ) in the case of wl 16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "analytical modeling does predict detectable pah polarization in astrophysical environments @xcite . though the astrophysical conditions they considered may be different from the condition in protoplanetary disks , pah polarization is too small ( 0.10.5% )",
    "to be distinguished from the contribution of linear dichroism by aligned foreground dust .",
    "0 spatial distribution of intensity at 8.6 and 11.2 @xmath6 along the major axis of the disk .",
    "there is a clear brightness asymmetry of sw ( blue ) and ne ( red ) sides of the disk at both wavelengths .",
    "( b ) : _ r = i@xmath52/i@xmath53 _ along the major axis of the disk as a tracer of the charge state of pahs . the larger the value , the more ionized are the pahs .",
    "the ratio is decreasing farther from the central star as the decreasing uv radiation .",
    "( c ) : the relative _",

    "the total intensity maps ( fig.[fig:0 ] ) of wl 16 reveal intriguing asymmetric features in the disk , including : ( 1 ) an s - shaped , spiral - arm - like structure extending to both sides of the disk ( green dots in fig.[fig:0 ] ) ; ( 2 ) a dark lane immediately outside the spiral - arm - like structure in the sw disk , at 1@xmath03 ( 163 au ) from the star ; ( 3 ) twisted surface brightness contours , i.e. , position angles of the contours major axes are changing from 95@xmath21 ( at smaller radii ) to 50@xmath21 ( at larger radii ) ; and ( 4 ) an asymmetric brightness distribution , the ne side being significantly brighter than the sw side of the disk . though",
    "especially obvious in the pah bands , some of these features are also seen in the continuum . in general",
    ", they appear to be qualitatively consistent with the scenario of an warped inner disk with respect to the outer disk as the result of precession induced by an unseen planet or stellar companions @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the dark lane in the sw could be a shadow cast by the disk warp .",
    "the illumination of a warped inner disk can mimic spiral features @xcite . although the twisted contours could be a result of a stellar companion of wl 16 , a search for such a companion turned out to be unsuccessful @xcite . at 40@xmath22 away ,",
    "elias 29 is the nearest ( in projection ) star of wl 16 , but there is no obvious evidence that these two objects are dynamically related .",
    "we expect high - resolution and high - sensitivity radio telescopes , such as alma and iram , could lead to our new understanding of the dynamic and structure of the object .",
    "we present mid - ir polarimetric imaging and spectral observations of wl 16 obtained with gtc / canaricam .",
    "wl 16 has a well resolved , extended disk ( diameter @xmath1900 au ) in the mid - ir with @xmath12% polarization .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "spectropolarimetry of wl 16 firmly supports the hypothesis that the observed mid - ir polarization is dominated by absorptive polarization arising from aligned non - spherical dust grains in the foreground .",
    "polarized emission from dust inside the disk is non - measurable with an upper limit 0.5% . because , in the most widely accepted dust alignment mechanisms , the absorptive polarization is parallel to the direction of b - field , we interpret the observed polarization map as indicating that the b - field in the molecular cloud is fairly uniform with projected orientation of about 33@xmath21 from north . the direction is consistent with the near - ir polarization at wl 16 and the large - scale optical @xmath2 ophiuchus star formation region polarimetry .",
    "though our original goal was to probe the b - field inside the protoplanetary disk , our study shows the importance of characterizing the foreground polarization as well .",
    "2 .   the maximum values of the polarization of wl 16 and the nearby - polarized standard elias 29 are proportional to their interstellar extinction . using this ratio",
    ", we are able to characterize the polarization efficiency of dust grains in the dense molecular cloud , ( @xmath3 ) @xmath41% mag@xmath5 . keeping in mind that the observed polarization is associated with the projected b - field component",
    ", the parameter may be useful for constraining the dust alignment efficiency and properties in this region and for interpreting the observed polarization to other sources .",
    "wl 16 is rich in pah emission features and we have detected the 8.6 , 11.2 , 12.0 , and 12.7 @xmath6 features in its disk .",
    "we see an asymmetry in the ratio @xmath54 between the two sides of the disk , with the ne ( sw ) side being brighter ( fainter ) at both 8.6 and 11.2 @xmath6 but with a lower ( higher ) value of @xmath54 . this anti - correlation may be explained by complicated disk structures , e.g. , warps and asymmetric disk inner rim .",
    "4 .   the total intensity maps of wl 16 reveal asymmetric features , such as the s - shaped spiral - arm - like structure , twisted contours , asymmetric brightness distributions , and a dark lane on the sw side of the disk .",
    "these may indicate a disk warp , with future observations , especially with alma and iram , likely to fully clarify this picture .",
