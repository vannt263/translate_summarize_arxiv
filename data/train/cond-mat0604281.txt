    "the finite  temperature behavior of sodium clusters has been attracted much attention since the pioneering experimental work by haberland and co - workers .",
    "@xcite these experiments reported melting temperatures of sodium clusters in the size range of 55 to 350 atoms .",
    "a great deal of effort has been spent to understand and explain the main puzzling feature , namely the irregular variation in the observed melting points .",
    "equally puzzling is the observation that na@xmath3 and na@xmath4 , which is neither geometric shell  closing systems nor electronic shell  closing systems , show higher melting temperatures than vicinity systems such as na@xmath0 and na@xmath5 of geometric shell  closing ones or na@xmath6 of electronic shell  closing one , which is not explained so far .",
    "although it is expected that there is an intricate interplay between the electronic and geometric structures so far as finite temperature behavior is concerned , the consensus seems to be that the geometry dominates the melting characteristics and the effects of electronic structure are secondary .",
    "@xcite this has been a surprise since the stability of these clusters is almost entirely dictated by the electronic structure .",
    "* according to our present calculations , it reveals that when a cluster with nearly electronic closed shell structure has nearly icosahedral ground state geometry , it shows a high melting temperature .",
    "*    recently a very different aspect of the finite  temperature behavior has been revealed in the experimental measurements of heat capacities of gallium and aluminum clusters ,  @xcite namely the size  sensitive nature of their _",
    "shapes_. a definitive correlation between the shape of specific heat curve and the nature of the ground ",
    "state geometry in gallium cluster has also been established by our group .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , in spite of extensive work reported on the bench mark system of sodium clusters , there is no report of such a size sensitivity .    in this paper , we show the effect of electronic structure on the melting of sodium cluster by comparison to a geometric shell  closing system .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are very few cases in sodium clusters where an electronic shell  closing system ( n=8 , 20 , 40 , 58 , 138 , ... ) has a similar size as a geometric shell  closing one ( n=55 , 147 , 309 , ... ) .",
    "for instance , a pair of clusters n=55 and n=58 differs by three atoms only .",
    "another example is a pair \\{n=138 and 147 } having nine  atom difference .",
    "the next such occurrence is at n=309 and n=338 , which is not close enough .",
    "therefore , the expected effects due to both the geometric and electronic magic numbers are likely to be seen prominently in \\{55 , 58 } range . the electronically closed ",
    "shell structure of na@xmath2 and nearly electronic shell closing system of na@xmath3 have slightly distorted icosahedral structures as their ground state geometries compared to the geometric shell  closing cluster of na@xmath0 .",
    "indeed , as we shall see , na@xmath2 and na@xmath3 , have significantly different finite  temperature characteristics as compared to those of geometrically closed  shell cluster , na@xmath0 .",
    "firstly , the shape of the specific heat curve is much broader than that of na@xmath0 .",
    "secondly , it shows a peak ( rather broad ) at the temperature approximately 375  k for na@xmath2 and 350  k for na@xmath3 .",
    "we note that the observed melting temperature of na@xmath3 by haberland and co  workers  @xcite is about 325  k which differs less than 8  @xmath7 from our result .",
    "specially , in case of na@xmath2 this is the first observation that a melting temperature of sodium cluster can be closed to that of the bulk .",
    "interestingly , it is observed that na@xmath2 shows high abundance in mass spectra , indicating its high stability .",
    "@xcite the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ comp ] , we briefly mention computational details used . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we discuss our results , and summarize the results in sec .",
    "we have carried out born  oppenheimer molecular  dynamics simulations using ultrasoft pseudopotentials within the local  density approximation  ( lda ) .  @xcite the reliability of our calculation can be judged from the fact that our earlier calculations based on density  functional theory ( dft ) have successfully reproduced the melting temperature of na@xmath8(@xmath9=55 , 92 , and 142 ) .",
    "@xcite in order to get an insight into the evolutionary pattern of the geometries , we have obtained equilibrium structures for na@xmath8 ( @xmath9=55 to 62 ) .",
    "our thorough search of the lowest  energy structure is done by obtaining at least 180 distinguishable equilibrium configurations for each of the clusters by using a combination of a basin  hopping algorithm and density  functional methods . with obtained ground  state geometry of na@xmath2 and na@xmath3 ,",
    "we have carried out extensive _ ab initio _ constant  temperature simulations using a nose  hoover thermostat to compare with geometrically closed shell system , na@xmath0 .",

    "our cell size used is 24@xmath1124@xmath1124  @xmath12 , with the energy cutoff of 3.6  ry whose reliability has been examined in our previous work .",
    "@xcite we use the multiple  histogram technique to calculate specific heat .",
    "more details of the methods can be found in ref .  .",
    "for the analysis , we have taken the last 165  ps data from each temperature , leaving at least first 45  ps for thermalization .",
    "3.3 in    the lowest  energy structures of na@xmath8 ( @xmath9=5562 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "there are some striking features evident in their evolutionary pattern .",
    "the ground  state geometry ( gs ) of na@xmath0 is the well  known icosahedron  @xcite .",
    "a single extra atom added to na@xmath0 is accommodated on the surface by a minor adjustment of surface atoms . when the second atom is added , it is energetically more favorable to retain the icosahedral core with two atoms _ capping _ it . very interestingly , when three atoms are added ( @xmath9=58 ) , instead of the pattern of capping continuing , all three atoms are accommodated on the surface of icosahedron , making the structure again nearly spherical without changing the size of na@xmath0 significantly .",
    "3.3 in    this can be verified by examining the distance from the center of mass ( com ) . in fig .",
    "[ dist_from_com ] , we show the distance from com in na@xmath2 and na@xmath13 by comparison with those of na@xmath0 . it is clearly seen that in comparison with the maximum distance from com in na@xmath0 , that in na@xmath2 is nearly remained the same , while in na@xmath13 it increases considerably .",
    "the pattern of growth from na@xmath13 to na@xmath1 changes back to the capping mode as can be seen in fig .  [ geometry ] . this peculiar shape transformation observed in na@xmath2 can be examined by plotting deformation parameter @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are eigenvalues of the quadrupole tensor @xmath17 with @xmath18 being _",
    "i_@xmath19 coordinate of ion @xmath20 relative to the center of mass of the cluster . for a spherical shape",
    "( @xmath21 ) @xmath14 is 1.0 , while @xmath22 1.0 indicates a deformation .",
    "2.8 in    it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eps_def_evs](a ) that the addition of three atoms over na@xmath0 changes the shape to nearly spherical .",
    "interestingly , this difference is reflected in their eigenvalue spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ eps_def_evs](b ) .",
    "a peculiarity of na@xmath2 is that the structure is not highly symmetric , rather in the sense of amorphous .",
    "however , it follows jellium  like pattern very closely in contrast to na@xmath3 , na@xmath13 to na@xmath1 where additional states appear in the gaps due to their disordered structures .",
    "such an effect is absent in na@xmath2 .",
    "in addition an electronic shell  closing system of na@xmath2 shows the highest gap of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) among present studied systems .",
    "thus , an electronically closed  shell nature of na@xmath2 results into a spherical charge density distribution which drives the geometry towards a spherical shape .",
    "our calculations bring out the fact that this change of shape induces the gs geometry to be compact with a significant structural disorder in na@xmath2 .",
    "this is an example of an _ electronically driven shape change_.    we find that to understand the melting behavior of small cluster , which we shall see later , it is important to study not only how many short bonds are there in the gs geometry of the cluster , but also how these short bonds are connected each other ( we call this  _ connectivity _ \" ) .",
    "thus , we have examined the bond lengths in na@xmath2 , na@xmath3 , and na@xmath0 as well as their connectivity .",
    "[ bondlength ] shows the number of bonds having bond lengths less than 3.71   , the bulk bond length .",
    "na@xmath2 has 21 bonds shorter than the shortest bond in na@xmath0 , which are located in the region a , shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , giving rise to an island of relatively strongly bonded atoms as compared to na@xmath0 . in na@xmath3",
    "there are 16 bonds which are shorter than the shortest bond in na@xmath0 .    3.2 in    fig .  [ connectivity ]",
    "shows how the nature of connectivity in these clusters with different bond lengths . in figs .",
    "[ connectivity](a)[connectivity](c ) , connectivity of short bonds are shown with bond lengths less than 3.45   , and figs.[connectivity](d)[connectivity](f ) for less than 3.55   .",
    "it can be seen that na@xmath0 has fewer short bonds ( 12 bonds ) than na@xmath2 ( 41 bonds ) and na@xmath3 ( 38 bonds ) .",
    "the majority of these strong bonded atoms in na@xmath2 form a connected island in the region a shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , while all short bonds in na@xmath0 are radial .",
    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ connectivity](d ) that for bond lengths",
    "less than 3.55     na@xmath2 shows not only that core atoms are strongly bonded to surface but that even surface atoms are bonded each other .",
    "in contrast to this , there is a connectivity only between core ( first shell ) and surface atoms but not among surface atoms in na@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ connectivity](f ) ) .",
    "na@xmath3 shows stronger and inhomogeneous connectivity than those seen in na@xmath0 but weaker than those seen in na@xmath2 in both bond length regimes .    3.3 in    thus , we conclude that to accommodate three extra atoms in na@xmath2 first  shell and surface distance",
    "is reduced , resulting in a strong network extending over entire cluster with inhomogeneous strength . to compare the gs structures of na@xmath2 and na@xmath0",
    ", we also analyze the distribution of short bond lengths in na@xmath2 and na@xmath0 by comparing the distance from different shells .",
    "it turns out that while na@xmath0 has shorter bond length between center atom and first ",
    "shell , the average bond length between first  shell and outer  shell is shorter in na@xmath2 . in a recent work by aguado and lpez ,",
    "@xcite they have attributed the higher melting temperature , seen in experiments of sodium clusters ,  @xcite to the existence of shorter bonds between the surface and first  shell atoms .",
    "our calculations are consistent with this observation .",
    "we have examined the electron localization function ( elf ) .",
    "the elf  @xcite is defined as @xmath23^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the valence electron density and @xmath27 s are the ks orbitals .",
    "the @xmath28 is 1.0 for perfect localized function and 0.5 for plain waves . in fig .",
    "[ elf ] , we show the elf isosurface of na@xmath2 for isovalue of @xmath28=0.79 in two different regions .    3.0 in    figs .",
    "[ elf](a ) and [ elf](b ) depicts the elf at 0.79 in regions a and b , respectively . the contrast is evident . in region",
    "a which consists of atoms connected by shorter bonds , the elf isosurface forms a connected network showing the existence of a strongly bonded region containing at least 20 atoms . in contrast , in region b such a network is absent .",
    "in fact , the region b gets connected at a lower isovalue of 0.74 .",
    "the same analysis has been carried out for n@xmath3 and na@xmath0 .",
    "na@xmath3 shows similar characteristics compared to those seen in na@xmath2 .",
    "a region near the capping atoms ( left  hand side in fig .",
    "[ connectivity](b ) starts connecting at @xmath28=0.78 , whereas a region away from them is connected at 0.74 .",
    "the connection of isosurface is established over the entire cluster of na@xmath0 at the isovalue of 0.72 .",
    "thus , our elf analysis clearly brings out the existence of strongly bonded island of atoms and the inhomogeneous distribution of bond strength in na@xmath2 and na@xmath3 .",
    "our study reveals two unique features in the ground state geometries of na@xmath2 and na@xmath3 .",
    "firstly , the ( nearly ) electronic shell closing system induces shortening of bonds , resulting in a strong connectivity of short bonds among the surface atoms as well as between first ",
    "shell and surface atoms compared to only first ",
    "shell to core connectivity established in na@xmath0 .",
    "secondly , its ground  state geometry is considerably disordered , resulting in inhomogeneous distribution of bond strength as compared to highly symmetric na@xmath0 .",
    "hear , disordering in these cases is related to the absence of spherical symmetry .",
    "we argue that these two effects will be manifested in the specific heat differently .",
    "the existence of the well  connected short ",
    "bonds are expected to raise the melting temperature as compared to that of na@xmath0 .",
    "the effect of geometric disorder is to broaden the specific heat .",
    "3.0 in    we show the calculated specific  heat curves for na@xmath2 and na@xmath3 along with those of na@xmath0 ,  @xcite in fig .",
    "the most symmetric cluster na@xmath0 shows a sharp melting transition at 280  k , while the highest melting temperature is seen in na@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the addition of two or three atoms changes the specific heat curve drastically .",
    "our calculations clearly demonstrate a strong correlation between the nature of order or lack of order in the gs geometry and their finite temperature behavior , and between the connectivity of short bonds and its melting temperature .",
    "this explanation can be extended to the finite temperature behavior in na@xmath29 ( figure not shown ) .",
    "na@xmath29 has a disordered gs geometry but does not possess a strongly connected network .",
    "@xcite the specific  heat curve of na@xmath29 , indeed , shows a very broad melting transition with low melting temperature ( 225  k ) .",
    "the results of the density  functional simulations carried by rytknen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as well as lee _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite are also consistent with the features that emerge out of our present calculation .",
    "an electronically closed ",
    "shell system na@xmath30 has a disturbed spherical gs geometry with a well  connected network of short bonds from core to surface atoms , which is stronger than that of na@xmath0 .",
    "its specific heat is broader but melting point is higher than that of na@xmath0 ( figure not shown ) .",
    "thus , it also brings out the size  sensitive nature of specific heat curve in sodium clusters , not reported so far either experimentally or computationally .",
    "it may be noted that extreme size sensitivity of this kind has been observed experimentally in ga and al clusters .",
    "@xcite we have also calculated the latent heats per tom by using caloric curves .",
    "they are estimated as 0.02  ev / atom for na@xmath2 , 0.016  ev for na@xmath3 , and 0.014  ev / atom for na@xmath0 .",
    "the latent heats observed by experiment  @xcite are 0.008  ev / atom for na@xmath3 and 0.015  ev / atom for na@xmath0 .",
    "the deviation observed in na@xmath3 may be due to its very broad melting transition .",
    "due to the disordered nature of the gs geometry in na@xmath2 , we expect different atoms to move with various amplitudes at a given temperature . to see this , we have calculated the lindemann criteria , i.e. , the root ",
    "mean  square bond length fluctuation ( @xmath31 ) for individual atoms of na@xmath2 , where @xmath32 for atom @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the distance between @xmath33 and @xmath36 ions with _ i _ @xmath37_j _",
    ", @xmath38 with @xmath9 be number of atoms in the cluster , and @xmath39 ... @xmath40 denotes a time average over the entire trajectory .",
    "indeed , @xmath32 in na@xmath2 has a broad range of values at a given temperature showing a different response for each atom , while for na@xmath0 ( highly symmetric structure ) they are collective , leading to a sharp transition region .",
    "further , it saturates at nearly 375  k in na@xmath2 compared to 280  k in na@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the center atom in na@xmath2 ( the bottom most line ) dose not develop its melting behavior till 300  k.    3.4 in    3.3 in    the disordered nature of the geometry leading to inhomogeneous distribution of bond strength results in distinctly different response of different atoms upon heating .",
    "we show the mean  square  displacement ( msd ) of individual atoms at 240  k in fig .",
    "[ atom_msq ] .",
    "evidently the atoms in these two clusters respond differently when heated . while na@xmath0 shows a clear solid  like behavior , a significant number of atoms in na@xmath2 show diffusive motion .",
    "we also observed the similar characteristics in na@xmath3 , seen in @xmath31 and msd of na@xmath2 .    3.0 in    3.2 in    as shown in fig .",
    "[ eigenvalue ] where we calculate the average eigenvalues carried over the entire simulation runs of na@xmath2 , na@xmath3 , and na@xmath0 , we do not find that liquid  like and solid  like behavior of these clusters are electronically similar .",
    "instead , the homo ",
    "lumo gaps in all the cases are closed . according to the calculations of @xmath14 as a function of temperature , after melting their geometries",
    "become elongated in these clusters .",
    "this can explain the close of homo  lumo gap .",
    "thus , the present extensive simulations clearly bring out the importance and significance of the electronic structure .",
    "interestingly , the change of eigenvalue spectrum and @xmath14 as a function of temperature in na@xmath2and na@xmath3 becomes similar after 180  k. even though the gs geometry of na@xmath3 is not spherical , its structure changes towards spherical shape upon heating .",
    "thus , when a cluster has both characteristics of ( nearly ) closed shell not only geometrically but also electronically , it has high melting temperature compared to those having either geometric close shell or electronic closed shell .",
    "this may explain the reason na@xmath4 has high melting temperature than na@xmath6 , an electronic closed  shell cluster and na@xmath5 , a geometric closed ",
    "shell one .",
    "to summarize , the present work brings out the effect of the electronic as well as the geometric structures on the melting of na@xmath2 and na@xmath3 clusters compared with that of na@xmath0 . the electronic shell  closing nature of na@xmath2 drives the gs geometry to be spherical , which leads to a compact and disordered structure . as consequence , in na@xmath2",
    "the first  shell and surface as well as atoms on the surface are well connected with short bonds .",
    "this leads to the high melting temperature of nearly bulk melting temperature .",
    "the disordered nature of system is responsible for rather broad specific heat curve .",
    "another example of strong connectivity is seen in the gs geometry of na@xmath3 , nearly electronic shell closed cluster , which also shows high melting temperature than geometrically closed shell system of na@xmath0 . the strong correlation between connectivity of bonds and melting temperature",
    "is also seen in the case of ga  @xcite and al clusters .",
