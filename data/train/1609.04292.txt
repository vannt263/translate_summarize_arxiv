    "the sum of the ricci scalar , @xmath13 , and the torsion scalar , @xmath5 , is a total divergence @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we find that the equations of motion derived from ( [ 1 ] ) are equivalent to those derived from einstein - hilbert action @xmath16\\sqrt{-g}d^4x.\\ ] ] one way to explain the inflationary regime of the early universe and also the late time acceleration is to introduce exotic scalar field in the einstein - hilbert action . if this scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity , we find that the difference between ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) becomes again a total divergence and both theories give the same equations of motion , but for non - minimal coupling this situation changes .",
    "let us consider an action with non - minimal coupling term @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18\\sqrt{-g}d^4x.\\ ] ] this non - minimal coupling is required for renormalizability of the theory , and has also root in quantum corrections to scalar field theory on curved space - time @xcite .",
    "this model has been employed to study the inflationary epoch by attributing the higgs scalar to the inflaton @xcite .",
    "inspired by ( [ 5 ] ) , the action @xmath19\\sqrt{-g}d^4x\\ ] ] has been introduced to describe the positive acceleration of the universe as well as the possible phantom divide line crossing @xcite . due to nonminimal coupling , i.e. @xmath20 , ( [ 5 ] ) is not equivalent to ( [ 6 ] ) . in @xcite",
    "a more general action was proposed @xmath21\\sqrt{-g}d^4x,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 .",
    "this model includes ( [ 5 ] ) , and ( [ 6 ] ) as its subclasses .",
    "this can be seen by setting @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "recently , different cosmological and gravitational aspects of this model was discussed in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider ( [ 7 ] ) in a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time filled nearly with pressureless matter and dark energy . based on this action",
    "we try to explain the late time cosmic acceleration after an epoch of matter domination .",
    "to do so , beside the non - minimal couplings , we also need to a conformal coupling between the quintessence and pressureless matter .",
    "this kind of coupling has been previously considered in screening model , such as chameleon @xcite and symmetron @xcite . in the symmetron model ,",
    "cosmic acceleration is related to a @xmath0 symmetry breaking triggered by reduction of dark matter density in the late time .",
    "but due to large mass of quintessence the scalar field overshoots rapidly and oscillates about the minimum of its effective potential and ceases promptly the acceleration .",
    "onset of acceleration in our model is somehow similar to the symmetron model , but the presence of non - minimal couplings in teleparallel model provides a framework such that the quintessence can reside at the minimum of its effective potential giving rise to a de sitter expansion ultimately .    the scheme of the paper is as follows : in the second section we introduce our model and , by obtaining vacuum solutions of the system , study @xmath0 symmetry breaking which leads to an accelerated universe after a decelerated matter dominated phase . in the third section , by employing a dynamical phase analysis , we study the stability of late time vacuum solution . in the fourth section",
    "we conclude our results .",
    "we will use units @xmath25 .",
    "we start with the action @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is a positive conformal coupling .",
    "we consider a spatially flat flrw space time filled nearly with the scalar field dark energy and pressureless matter .",
    "the scalar field equation of motion derived from ( [ 8 ] ) is @xmath30 the matter continuity equation reads @xmath31 by defining the density @xmath32 we find @xmath33 note that @xmath34 is a mathematical @xmath35 independent variable , which facilitates our computations and interpretations .",
    "in this space - time we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the hubble parameter which in terms of the scalar factor , @xmath39 , is given by @xmath40 .",
    "variation of ( [ 8 ] ) with respect to the vierbeins yields @xmath41 and @xmath42    two of the three equations ( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) , and ( [ 15 ] ) are independent .",
    "we consider ( [ 13 ] ) , and ( [ 14 ] ) as independent equations . to solve them",
    "we must identify @xmath43 and @xmath29 . as we want to study the @xmath0 symmetry breaking",
    ", we choose the potential as @xmath44 and take @xmath29 as an even function of @xmath35 , such that @xmath45 in ( ) behaves as a @xmath34 dependent mass term .",
    "based the coincidence problem and structures formation , we expect that in the early universe the contribution of dark energy was negligible .",
    "therefore we assume that , initially the scalar field stays at the vacuum identified by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 so @xmath49 in this epoch the universe is dominated by matter evolving according to : @xmath50 note that @xmath51 is a nonzero number .",
    "the scalar field stays in the vacuum , @xmath46 , as long as its squared effective mass is still positive @xmath52 from ( [ 13 ] ) , and ( [ 16 ] ) , we find @xmath53 to build our model we need that @xmath54 becomes a nonzero number . in this way , the sign of the effective squared mass depends on the value of the dark matter density .",
    "like @xcite , we take @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a mass scale . hence ( [ 19 ] ) becomes @xmath57 thus provided that @xmath58 as long as @xmath59 @xmath60 holds and the scalar field stays at the stable point @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath61 , @xmath62 and this point becomes unstable .",
    "the scalar field becomes tachyonic and rolls to the new minimum of its effective potential .",
    "so in the first stage we have a universe with zero energy density dominated by baryonic and cold dark matter .    in the second stage",
    "we require that dark energy density increases and gives rise to universe acceleration . to see how this expectation can be realized ,",
    "let us obtain the vacuum after the symmetry breaking . by bearing in mind that @xmath63",
    ", the late time vacuum solution can be found from ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "this solutions is characterized by @xmath48 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 from ( [ 15 ] ) we have also @xmath66 .",
    "this solution corresponds to a de sitter expansion with a constant @xmath38 . in the first stage",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath67 , is @xmath68 . in the second stage ,",
    "the late time critical point is given by @xmath69 .",
    "so we expect that universe enters a positive accelerated phase after matter dominated era .",
    "finally the system settles down in a de sitter state .",
    "solutions of ( [ 24 ] ) are @xmath70 these solutions are real provided that @xmath71 also , when @xmath72 only @xmath73 and @xmath74 exist .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) or ( [ 27 ] ) imply that @xmath75 .",
    "whence , if we insist to have late time acceleration , the initial stability condition ( [ 22 ] ) does not hold if we ignore the conformal coupling .",
    "in other words the conformal coupling retains the quintessence in initial stable state for @xmath76 , while the nonminimal couplings ( @xmath77 ) are necessary for late time acceleration .    to elucidate this subject",
    "let us see whether the same scenario can be set up in the minimal case , @xmath78 . in the first stage",
    "when @xmath79 , the quintessence settles down in the minimum of its effective potential at @xmath46 . when @xmath80 , the @xmath0 symmetry breaks and the field moves towards the new vacuum @xmath81",
    ". finally as @xmath82 , @xmath35 oscillates about @xmath83 .",
    "note that as @xmath84 , the solution ( [ 24 ] ) , which gives a negative @xmath85 , is not valid in this case and the field can not stay at the minimum of its potential but oscillates about it and acts as a pressureless matter @xcite , giving rise to a decelerated expansion .",
    "moreover , if one considers local gravity tests to screen the new force mediated by the scalar field , he obtains a large mass for the scalar field which expedites this overshoot . besides , after the symmetry breaking the quintessence potential ( [ 16 ] ) becomes negative and as it is known a quintessence with negative potential can not drive the acceleration in the minimal case @xcite . to remedy this ,",
    "some authors add a positive constant to ( [ 16 ] ) playing the role of a cosmological constant rendering the problem to @xmath86 scenario .",
    "phase space analysis may be employed to investigate the stability of the solution ( [ 25 ] ) . to do",
    "so we define @xmath87 these variables satisfy the autonomous equations @xmath88 where @xmath89 and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 is given by @xmath92 to derive ( [ 30 ] ) we have used the friedmann equation @xmath93 the critical point corresponding to the late time evolution of the universe is given by @xmath94 corresponding to ( [ 25 ] ) , where @xmath95 .",
    "the stability of this point may be checked as follows .",
    "setting @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , we find @xmath99 where @xmath100 at the critical point @xmath101 , @xmath102 becomes @xmath103 where @xmath104 from ( [ 29 ] ) , we obtain @xmath105 inserting ( [ 36 ] ) into ( [ 35 ] ) , and by considering the potential ( [ 16 ] ) , we find @xmath106 where @xmath107",
    "so eigenvalues of ( [ 34 ] ) are @xmath108 if we require that all eigenvalues to be negative , which is sufficient condition to have an attractor , we must take @xmath109 ( [ 37 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) give @xmath110 which is the condition to have an attractor at late time .",
    "we tried to attribute the late time cosmic acceleration to symmetry breaking in a teleparallel model of cosmology in which quintessence is coupled no - minimally to both the scalar torsion and a boundary term .",
    "we derived equations of motion , from which suitable solutions were derived .",
    "the solutions were classified into two classes : before symmetry breaking and after symmetry breaking . before symmetry breaking , provided that ( [ 22 ] ) holds , the conformal coupling holds the quintessence in the bottom of its effective potential . in this epoch dark energy",
    "has no contribution in total energy and so the coincidence problem may be alleviated in this model . when the density of matter becomes less than a critical value ( given by ( [ 23 ] ) ) , the initial vacuum becomes a false vacuum and the quintessence moves towards its new vacuum which describes a state with de sitter expansion ( provided that the conditions ( [ 26 ] ) or ( [ 27 ] ) be satisfied ) .",
    "finally , if ( [ 41 ] ) holds , the scalar filed resides at this vacuum due to the presence of the nonminimal couplings . in figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) ,",
    "the behaviors of the quintessence and the deceleration parameter are depicted .",
    "figure ( [ fig1 ] ) shows that the scalar field leaves @xmath46 after the symmetry breaking and tends towards the final critical point and finally settles down in it .",
    "figure ( [ fig2 ] ) shows that , during this evolution , the deceleration factor becomes negative in a time of order of the present hubble time .",
    "this figure also shows the possibility to have super - acceleration phase @xmath111 which is forbidden in the minimal case ( see([15 ] ) ) .",
