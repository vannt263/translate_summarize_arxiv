    "the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in 1995 by three different groups @xcite has fueled renewed interest in this subject , with many more groups trying to achieve the conditions under which the bec - transition occurs . stated simply , one has to reach the point where the nearest - neighbor distance between the atoms is of the same order of magnitude as their de broglie - wavelength @xmath1 . in mathematical terms , the condition to fulfill is @xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3 the atomic number density .",
    "experimentally , this can be achieved by evaporative cooling of atoms caught in a trap , with typical final conditions given by a temperature of @xmath4 1 @xmath5k and a density of @xmath6 atoms/@xmath7 @xcite for na , and @xmath4 170 nk at @xmath8 atoms/@xmath7 @xcite for rb .",
    "both the efficiency of the cooling process and the final density achievable depend on the rates of inelastic and elastic collisions in the ultra - cold atom clouds used @xcite . with alkali atoms ,",
    "inelastic loss in binary collisions between ground - state atoms is due mostly to hyperfine - changing collisions , with rates on the order of @xmath9 for rb @xcite .",
    "these rates are generallly low enough to allow condition ( [ eqbec ] ) to be reached @xcite . in addition",
    ", all the alkali atoms have closed optical transitions from the ground state that are accessible with commercially available lasers , allowing for initial trapping and cooling in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) . as a result",
    ", bec has now been achieved in na , rb and li , while work is in progress on k and cs .    in comparison , the properties of rare gas atoms",
    "@xcite seem less promising . as with atomic hydrogen , laser cooling and",
    "trapping starting from the ground state is not practical due to the very short wavelengths required ( 75  nm for neon ) .",
    "all rare gas atoms have a metastable first excited state , however , that does allow for optical manipulation . for he , this is the \\{(1s 2s ) 2@xmath10s } state , while for ne ( @xmath3=2 ) through xe ( @xmath3=5 ) the appropriate state can be written \\{(@xmath3p)@xmath11 ( @xmath3 + 1)s @xmath10p@xmath0}. condensates of such atoms might show interesting new phenomena related to the available electronic energy , such as collective decay or ionization .",
    "in addition , an `` atom laser '' @xcite based on such condensates may find applications that are not covered by alkali atoms : because of the large internal energy of metastable rare gas atoms , one might make the comparison with the high - energy photons of an xuv optical laser as opposed to those from a hene - laser . on the downside ,",
    "this internal energy of rare gas atoms is always enough to allow for ionization in binary collisions @xcite .",
    "consequently , ionization becomes a major loss process in metastable atom traps , with experimental rates reported to be as large as @xmath12 for @xcite .",
    "such high rates make achieving condition ( [ eqbec ] ) impractical using the techniques currently employed for alkali atoms .    for he ,",
    "shlyapnikov and co - workers @xcite have shown , however , that the ionization rate can be very strongly suppressed by spin - polarizing the atoms . in the process @xmath13 the initial state then has total electron spin s  =  2 , while in the final state spin can only be s  =  0,1 . because the ionization process conserves electron spin ,",
    "ionization is prohibited in the s  =  2 ( quintet ) states and can proceed only after a magnetic interaction between the electrons causes a spin - flip during a binary encounter . shlyapnikov and co - workers @xcite found that at ultra - cold temperatures the relatively weak spin - dipole or magnetic spin - spin interaction then limits the ionization rate in spin - polarized metastable he samples to the order of @xmath14  @xcite .    for the heavier rare gases ne through xe , the spin - conservation rule holds also .",
    "therefore , suppression of ionization by spin - polarization should be feasible as well .",
    "an added complication , however , is the fact that the unfilled  core now has p - character , as opposed to the he case , where it has s - character .",
    "this causes an orientation dependence of the electrostatic interaction potentials that is present even at large internuclear separation . during a collision ,",
    "this causes the  cores to reorient , which , through the spin - orbit interaction , induces electron spin - flips .",
    "since this interaction has an electrostatic origin rather than the magnetic one that causes spin - flips in he collisions , one may expect it to have a much larger influence and possibly limit the ionization rate for spin - polarized samples to much larger values than for he .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to estimate these effects for trapped clouds of atoms .    out of the various rare gases , we concentrate on neon because this element is being used in experiments presently going on in our laboratory @xcite .",
    "in addition , the properties necessary for our calculations are most readily available for this species @xcite .",
    "while for most alkali atoms , the properties of the atom - atom interactions are known quite accurately @xcite , the situation is very different for the rare gases , so that we have to make our own estimates .",
    "the -configuration of any of the heavy rare gases contains four energy levels , with the @xmath10p@xmath0-state always the lowest - lying state .",
    "table [ tablestates ] lists the properties of these states in neon .",
    "the four atomic fine - structure states give rise to a total of 144 molecular states .",
    "in what follows we will concentrate on the 25 states that connect asymptotically to + , since the @xmath10p@xmath0 state is the only state that is both and has non - zero angular momentum , thus allowing for magnetic trapping and spin - polarization .    in the following sections we develop auto - ionization widths , short - range and long - range real potentials for the equivalent process of eq .",

    "the @xmath15-matrix for such a block will be denoted @xmath23 .",
    "the spin - polarized and non - polarized channels can be easily identified because all the non - ionizing , quintet states have @xmath24 exclusively .    for any given parity , only even @xmath19 ( @xmath25 ) or odd @xmath19 ( @xmath26 )",
    "contribute . because the -atoms we are dealing with are bosons , in addition only states that are symmetric under the exchange of two atoms can contribute .",
    "this translates into the rule that @xmath27 must be even .",
    "since parity is conserved in a collision , it follows that the non - ionizing quintet states ( @xmath24 ) can only couple to other even @xmath20 = 0,2 states .    because of the presence of ionization , the @xmath15-matrix for ( in)elastic scattering is not unitary .",
    "ionization rates follow from the loss of flux described by this property . for the case of a trapped cloud of atoms ,",
    "the distribution of the direction of the initial relative velocity of two atoms is spatially isotropic . taking this into account",

    "@xcite ) . according to the table , for xe the qq - term will be about @xmath43 times larger than for ne .    to obtain an estimate of the dd - term ,",
    "we have used a second - order perturbation treatment of the dd - interaction based on experimental values @xcite for the  to @xmath44p@xmath45p@xmath46 transition , analogous to our previous treatment of the dd - interaction for the @xmath44p@xmath45s@xmath46+@xmath44p@xmath45p@xmath46 configuration in the rare gases @xcite .",

    "the orientation - dependence of the values obtained in this way can be understood from a semi - classical description of the dd - interaction , where the polarizability of a ne atom is thought to be made up of a combination of a large , spatially isotropic value @xmath47",

    "table [ tablemolec ] lists the properties of the 25 molecular eigenstates that diagonalize the combination of the dd- and qq - interaction matrices with the atomic energy - matrix . from the and  values listed ,",
    "it becomes clear that , on average , the qq - term is quite a small effect .",
    "for one it is overwhelmed by the dd - term out to internuclear distances of @xmath54 4000 a.u . beyond that point ,",
    "its value is considerably less than 1 pk , far below the collision energy currently obtainable in atom traps .",
    "therefore , the low - energy behavior of the the scattering rates will be determined by the dd - term . since , however , the anisotropy due to the qq - term ( 1 a.u .",
    "/@xmath55 ) is of the same order of magnitude as the qq - term itself , while that due to the dd - term ( 4.5 a.u .",
    "/@xmath56 ) is only a fraction of its average value , the qq term should still be expected to determine the absolute value of the ionization rates for spin - polarized atoms , which are governed by inelastic , spin - changing processes .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there is little information available about the interaction potentials of the heavier rare gases .",
    "we can obtain rough estimates of these , however , by considering the analogy with ground - state alkali - atoms .",

    "this result is largely due to the fact that the depolarization due to the long - range anisotropy is counteracted strongly at short range by the separation of the non - ionizing quintet states from the other , ionizing states [ see fig.([figpots ] ) ] .",

    "[ seclongrange ] .      since the short - range potentials for the ne - system",

    "of particular importance are resonances due to quasi - bound states with total energy equal to that of the @xmath106 quintet state",
    ". these can give rise to the formation of a relatively long - lived collisional complex , in which the atoms undergo a number of vibrations before they exit .",

    "figure ( [ figvars ] ) shows that a variation of the  singlet potential only has a small effect on @xmath28 . in this case , only the energy levels in the quintet states are unaffected by the change in phase - content , since they derive solely from the  triplet potential .",
    "we can conclude , therefore , that resonances in states other than the quintet states do not seriously alter @xmath28 .",

    "can then be considered a quantum - statistical effect : for polarized atoms , the @xmath100 partial wave necessarily represents a greater flux than for unpolarized atoms , since in the former case the @xmath140 partial wave is absent .",
    "in this paper we have developed a semi - quantitative description of ionization in metastable neon collisions at very low temperatures .",
    "in fact , this description holds for all the heavy metastable rare gas atoms , but we have concentrated on neon because of ongoing experiments in our laboratory as well as the availability of the properties needed as input to the model .",
    "we have put special emphasis on obtaining a lower limit on the ionization rate for spin - polarized atoms , in order to investigate the possibilites of reaching bose - einstein condensation with rare gas atoms .",
    "while we are not able to provide a definitive answer , we do provide a framework of potentials and auto - ionization widths that allow one to investigate the system in a qualitative way .",
    "it has become clear that such a limit depends strongly on the occurrence of quasi - bound resonances in the potentials for fully polarized atoms with @xmath141 .",
    "while it is possible to obtain reasonable estimates of the anisotropy of the long - range part of these potentials , sufficiently accurate information on the short - range parts is not available at this moment .",
    "such potentials may become available in the near future , however @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that , under favorable conditions , the long - range anisotropy still allows for very effective suppression ( up to @xmath121 times ) of ionization by spin - polarization , at least for ne .",
    "this suppression becomes less effective as the atom becomes heavier , with a limit of @xmath142 for xe .",
    "additional couplings may exist between the quintet states and the ionizing states that we have not considered .",
    "such couplings may occur at smaller @xmath93 , where core - valence interactions become more important .",
    "the interactions that will have an effect on the ionization rate for spin - polarized atoms must create a direct coupling between a quintet state and other , ionizing states . for xe ,",
    "e.g. , one should expect a large effect of the second - order spin - orbit splitting from the experience with cs  @xcite . a simple splitting of the various quintet potentials , however , due to a dependence of the potentials on a @xmath143 or @xmath113 orientation of the cores , does not have such an effect , at least not for small magnetic confining fields .",
    "this is because rare gas atoms in general lack hyperfine - structure , so that exothermic exit channels do not exist . as a result ,",
    "depolarization through such a mechanism is prohibited .",
    "we have checked this by adding a phenomenological @xmath144 core - splitting to our potentials , with an order of magnitude comparable to that found in the ne+ne@xmath145-system @xcite .",
    "the ionization rate for polarized atoms was found to increase only slightly with the magnitude of this splitting .",
    "a large magnetic confining field , however , could cause zeeman splittings greater than the centrifugal barrier present in the @xmath141 quintet states .",
    "this would open up new channels for depolarizing collisions that require only a splitting within the quintet states . given the height of the centrifugal barrier , 5.8  mk for ne and @xmath146",
    ", such processes should be expected to be fully developed at magnetic fields of approximately 60  gauss .",
    "it may be profitable , therefore , to use the minimum practical trapping field for metastable rare gas atom traps .",
    "another factor that we have not taken into account is that curve - crossings of the +  states can occur with other molecular states from the ne+ne  system at some intermediate range . for ne , it is possible to develop potentials for this full system with the recipe developed in sec .",
    "[ secpots ] .",
    "the result of such a treatment is shown in fig .",
    "( [ figfullpots ] ) . in this case , the +  quintet states indeed cross several states with other asymptotic limits .",
    "closer inspection has taught us that some of these are indeed avoided crossings , with the coupling due to the dd- and qq - interactions . at the crossing points ,",
    "a second order treatment of the dd - interaction in fact no longer suffices .",
    "flux entering on one of the quintet states can now be diverted onto curves that allow ionization to occur at short range . in order for the effect of such crossings to be taken into account , an @xmath93-dependent treatment of the dd- and qq - interactions would be necessary , and in addition a much larger system of coupled equations would have to be solved .",
    "we consequently leave such a treatment to a future paper .",
