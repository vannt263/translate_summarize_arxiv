    "there are also some examples using techniques from quantum information to prove new mathematical results .",
    "for example regev and vidick used the embezzlement state for a simplified proof of the so called grothendieck theorem for operator spaces ( @xcite ) and ahlswede / winter s application of the goldon - thompson inequality has found numerous application in compressed sensing ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we will use quantum teleportation , one of the most important quantum information protocols , to provide some very sharp embeddings between noncommutative @xmath0-spaces .",
