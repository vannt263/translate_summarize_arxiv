    "some neutron - rich nuclei towards the neutron drip line , which have the neutron numbers @xmath0 8 and 20 , are now widely recognized to be deformed and often called nuclei in the  island of inversion  @xcite . in this paper the change of shell structure in weakly - bound and one - particle resonant neutron levels coming from a unique behaviour of small-@xmath1 neutron levels compared with large-@xmath1 levels is exhibited .",
    "the behaviour comes from the strong @xmath1-dependence of the heights of centrifugal barrier , which are proportional to @xmath2 where @xmath3 is slightly larger than the nuclear radius .",
    "the centrifugal barrier is absent for @xmath4 neutrons which can thus freely extend to the outside of nuclei as the binding energy approaches zero .",
    "consequently , the energy of weakly - bound @xmath4 neutron levels is relatively insensitive to the strength of the potential .",
    "in contrast , large-@xmath1 neutrons are confined to the inside of the potential and , thus , sensitive to the strength of the potential .",
    "the barrier becomes increasingly higher both for larger @xmath1 neutrons and for smaller nuclei . as an example , in figure 1 we sketch the relative energies of three one - neutron levels in the @xmath5 shell depending on binding energies .",
    "the figure illustrates how the levels with smaller @xmath1-values shift downwards relative to those with larger @xmath1-values , as the potential strength becomes weaker .",
    "the cases of the strongly bound ( such as by 30 mev ) levels and those bound by about 10 mev ( approximately equal to the fermi level of stable @xmath5 shell nuclei ) can be found from figure 2 - 30 of @xcite , while the level order of very weakly bound or one - particle resonant neutrons can be found for example in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the level scheme being bound by about 10 mev is similar to that of the conventional modified - oscillator potential plus a spin - orbit potential .",
    "this similarity is accidental .",
    "namely , this never means that `` the one - particle level scheme of weakly - bound neutrons becomes similar to that of the harmonic oscillator potential ( plus a spin - orbit potential ) '' , which is unfortunately often stated in some publications .",
    "indeed , the harmonic oscillator potential has no surface and , consequently , using the potential it is impossible to express some phenomena which are unique in weakly - bound particles .",
    "the similar change of the relative level order and the shell structure , which is sketched in figure 1 for the @xmath5 shell , occurs for other shells .",
    "for example , in the @xmath6 shell the @xmath7 and @xmath8 levels are lowered relative to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 levels as the potential becomes weaker or the binding energies become smaller , since the centrifugal barrier for @xmath1=1 neutrons is six times lower than that for @xmath1=3 neutrons .",
    "this change of the shell structure can lead to the deformed ground state of some nuclei with the traditional magic number for neutrons .",
    "see examples in section 3 .    whether a given nucleus with weakly - bound neutrons will deform or not depends , of course , also on the proton number , since some proton number may definitely favor spherical shape .",
    "for example , the proton number z=8 , oxygen isotope , has been known to prefer spherical shape .",
    "nevertheless , it was recently reported @xcite that the unbound nucleus @xmath11o@xmath12 outside the proton drip line is deformed in the way similar to its mirror nucleus @xmath13be@xmath14 .",
    "it is important to notice that the notion of one - particle states in deformed nuclei can be much more widely , in a good approximation , applicable than that in spherical nuclei .",
    "this is because in the deformed mean field the major part of the long - range two - body interaction in the spherical mean field is already taken into account in the mean field .",
    "thus , the spectroscopy of deformed nuclei is often much simpler than that of spherical ( vibrating ) nuclei .",
    "for example , we note that the analysis of observed spectroscopic properties of low - lying states in light mirror nuclei , @xmath15mg@xmath16 and @xmath17al@xmath18 , in terms of one - particle motion in deformed ( nilsson ) potential is very successful @xcite .",
    "as seen in those examples , the numerical results of the intrinsic configurations , which are obtained in the present work for the ground state of nuclei with the neutron number of @xmath19 , can be equally applicable to the low - lying excited states ( or isomeric states ) of the neighboring nuclei .    as the one - particle energy @xmath20 approaches zero in a deformed potential , the probability of @xmath21 component in the wave function approaches unity in all @xmath22=1/2@xmath23 bound neutron orbits .",
    "however , the energy , at which the @xmath4-dominance shows up , depends on both deformation and individual orbits . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath22=1/2@xmath24 and @xmath22=3/2@xmath24",
    "the @xmath25-components increases as @xmath26 , but the probability of @xmath27 components at @xmath28 0 is less than unity and depends on individual levels and deformations .    except in very light nuclei a significant change of shell structure in weakly - bound protons is not expected because of the presence of the coulomb barrier . for this reason",
    "the shell structure and magnetic moments of proton - drip - line nuclei are not included in this work .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic moment of deformed odd - z nuclei towards the neutron drip line is a very useful and interesting quantity , since it may clearly show possible deformation of those nuclei .",
    "however , the proton separation energy of those neutron - rich nuclei is so large that the shell structure as well as magnetic moments can be reasonably evaluated using some old traditional models , for example , the modified - oscillator model . therefore , the numerical calculations are not included here .    when possible rotational spectra or strongly - enhanced quadrupole moments , which are the direct sign of deformation , are difficult to be measured in neutron drip line nuclei , an indication of deformation is to observe the unusually low - lying 2@xmath29 state in even - even nuclei . on the other hand , one - particle motion in the mean field that shows the shape of nuclei can be easily recognized by studying the low - energy spectra of odd - a nuclei @xcite . in particular , the spin - parity of low - lying states or magnetic moments of the ground or isomeric states of odd - a drip - line nuclei may be sometimes more easily measured and can be used as a clear indication of possible deformation .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we survey the nilsson diagrams that can be applicable to weakly - bound nuclei with @xmath0 8 , 20 , 28 and 40 , and give the estimated values of magnetic moments of possibly deformed odd - n nuclei with the neutron number close to those traditional magic numbers .    in section 2 the essential points of the model used in the present work",
    "are briefly summarized .",
    "numerical examples for nuclei in the @xmath30 region is given in section 3.1 , the @xmath31 region in section 3.2 , the @xmath32 region in section 3.3 , and the region @xmath33 region in section 3.4 .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in section 4 .",
    "recognizing the great usefulness of the nilsson diagram , in which one - particle energies are plotted as a function of deformation parameter for a given potential , in the present article we apply the model and idea presented in @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath34 is defined in @xcite .",
    "the coupled equations derived from the schrdinger equation are solved in coordinate space with the correct asymptotic behaviour of wave functions for @xmath35 , both for bound @xcite and resonant @xcite levels . in particular ,",
    "one - particle resonant levels in a deformed potential are estimated using the eigenphase formalism @xcite .",
    "namely , one - particle resonance is obtained if one of calculated eigenphases increases through @xmath36 as one - particle energy increases .",
    "one - particle resonance is not obtained if none of the calculated eigenphases increase through @xmath36 as energy increases .",
    "the definition is a natural extension of the definition of one - particle resonance for spherical potentials in terms of phase shift , which can be found in standard textbooks .",
    "one - particle resonance with @xmath37=1/2@xmath29 is not at all obtained if for @xmath26 the @xmath1=0 component of the wave function inside the potential exceeds a certain probability @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath38 one - particle resonant levels can be always found at least for small positive energies . compared with the nilsson diagram based on modified oscillator potentials , the striking difference of the level scheme exhibited in the present work comes from the behaviour of levels with low @xmath1 values ( in particular , @xmath1=0 and 1 ) for @xmath34=0 and those with small @xmath39 values ( in particular , @xmath22 = 1/2@xmath29 , 1/2@xmath40 , and 3/2@xmath40 ) for @xmath41 0 , in both the weakly - bound and positive - energy regions .",
    "we use the parameters of woods - saxon potentials taken from the standard ones @xcite for stable nuclei except the depth , @xmath42 .",
    "the potential depth for neutrons is adjusted so that the energy of the one - neutron level last occupied in a given odd - n nucleus is close to the measured neutron separation energy .",
    "the diffuseness , the strength of the spin - orbit potential and the radius parameter are , for simplicity , taken from those on p.239 of @xcite . considering the possible contribution by weakly - bound neutron(s ) to the self - consistent potential , a slightly larger diffuseness might be appropriate for presently studied nuclei .",
    "however , it is noted that the major part of the nuclear potential is provided by well - bound nucleons of the core . moreover",
    ", a larger diffuseness leads to the degeneracy of the 2@xmath43 and 1@xmath44 ( 2@xmath7 and 1@xmath45 ) levels already at a larger binding energy than the one exhibited in the present article .",
    "it is also remarked that for a given deformation the n - th deformed one - particle orbit filling - in all lower - lying nilsson levels is almost uniquely determined for a given one - particle energy and within a reasonable variation of woods - saxon potential parameters .",
    "the magnetic dipole moments of odd - n deformed nuclei are calculated using equations ( 4 - 86 ) , ( 4 - 87 ) , and ( 4 - 88 ) of @xcite , while the matrix elements of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are evaluated using one - particle wave - functions in the deformed woods - saxon potential . see equations ( 5 - 86 ) and ( 5 - 87 ) of @xcite .",
    "the tabulated magnetic moments are calculated for the band - head states for given intrinsic configurations .",
    "the spin of the band - head state is @xmath48 for @xmath49 . for @xmath39=1/2 configurations",
    "the decoupling parameter @xmath50 is calculated , and the spin of the band - head state is different from i=1/2 for both @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the major part of the reduction of the effective @xmath53 factor , @xmath54 , from @xmath55 in the present model is supposed to come from the spin polarization of deformed even - even core . for large deformation where the asymptotic quantum numbers [ n n@xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath39 ] become good quantum numbers , the spin polarizations of @xmath59=0 type vanish , since the quantum numbers @xmath57 and @xmath60 (= @xmath39 @xmath61 @xmath57 ) become constants of the motion . consequently , the longitudinal @xmath54 factor may approach @xmath55 , while the transverse matrix element ( @xmath62 @xmath61 @xmath63)b in equation ( 4 - 86 ) of @xcite is still affected by the presence of @xmath59=1 polarizations of deformed even - even core .",
    "the latter contributes only to the magnetic moments of k=1/2 bands .",
    "the quenching of the spin fluctuations in the large deformation limit seems to be only partially achieved for the equilibrium deformations of stable deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "( a further reduction in the spin polarization of nuclei presently studied may come from the fact that loosely - bound neutrons couple weakly with strongly - bound core nucleons . ) in the present numerical calculations we use @xmath54=@xmath55 in the lightest mass ( @xmath64 region where deformed nuclei have larger deformation , while in heavier mass regions @xmath54=(0.7)@xmath55 is used .",
    "we do not try any detailed evaluation of the spin polarization effect in individual deformed nuclei , since our present aim is to show the spin - parity as well as magnetic moments for deformed shape of nuclei studied , which are very different from those for spherical shape .    in the present coupled channel calculation the @xmath65 = 1/2 , 3/2 , 5/2 , 7/2 , 9/2 , 11/2 and 13/2 channels",
    "are included for positive - parity levels , while the @xmath65 = 1/2 , 3/2 , 5/2 , 7/2 , 9/2 and 11/2 channels for negative - parity levels .",
    "as it is known that the shape of the be isotope can be very different for the a and a+1 nuclei , the notion of the mean field is not so well established in nuclei of this very light mass region .",
    "nevertheless , in figure 2 the nilsson diagram is shown , of which the parameters are adjusted to the nucleus @xmath66c@xmath67 , since in this mass region the spin - parity and/or magnetic moments are measured for some odd - n nuclei with weakly - bound neutron(s ) . in figure 2 the [ 200 1/2 ] level can be obtained as a one - particle resonant level as far as @xmath68 components are dominant .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath69 the resonant level is not obtained because the @xmath4 component becomes dominant in the one - particle wave - function .",
    "similarly , due to the @xmath4-component dominance the extension of the [ 220 1/2 ] level to the positive - energy region on the oblate side as a resonant level is not possible for @xmath70 .    in figure 2 , it is seen that in the spherical limit ( @xmath34=0 ) the very weakly bound @xmath71 and @xmath72 levels are almost degenerate .",
    "namely , as the binding becomes very weak , the energy eigenvalue of the @xmath4 orbit shifts downward relative to that of the @xmath68 level , as schematically exhibited in figure 1 .",
    "the calculated and measured magnetic moments of the ground state of @xmath66c@xmath67 and @xmath73be@xmath74 are compared in table 1 .",
    "it is remarked that for a much weaker strength of the potential such as the one applicable for @xmath75be , in which the [ 220 1/2 ] and [ 101 1/2 ] orbits at @xmath76 are bound by several hundreds kev , the calculated bound one - particle level scheme and magnetic moments around @xmath34=0.6 are found to remain nearly the same .",
    "when in a given region of deformation the curve of the nilsson level is almost a straight line as a function of deformation , the one - particle wave - function depends very little on deformation and , consequently , the calculated magnetic moment remains almost independent of deformation .",
    "we notice that measured magnetic moment of @xmath77c@xmath78 ( i=1/2@xmath29 ) that can be a spherical nucleus , @xmath79 @xmath80 @xcite , is nearly equal to that of @xmath75be@xmath74 ( i@xmath81=1/2@xmath29 ) that is most easily interpreted as a deformed nucleus , assuming that the sign of the former is minus .",
    "this is theoretically expected because the [ 220 1/2 ] wave - function of the 7th neutron in @xmath75be consists exclusively of @xmath71 and @xmath72 components , of which non - diagonal matrix element of magnetic dipole operator is zero , and , furthermore , the neutron one - particle magnetic moments of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the same .",
    "the spin - parity ( 3/2@xmath29 ) of the ground state of @xmath82c@xmath67 is in a very natural way interpreted as the band - head state of the n=11th neutron occupying the [ 211 3/2 ] level .",
    "the near degeneracy of the 1@xmath44 and 2@xmath43 levels at @xmath34=0 can well be the reason why the nucleus @xmath82c is deformed ( jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "the measured magnetic moment is in good agreement with the calculated value based on the deformation , as seen in table 1 .      in figure 3",
    "the nilsson diagram is shown , of which the parameters are approximately adjusted to the nucleus @xmath83ne@xmath84 . for a slightly stronger potential which may be applicable for @xmath85mg@xmath86 ( the neutron separation energy @xmath87 = 2.38 mev ) and @xmath88mg@xmath84 ( @xmath87 = 2.22 mev ) , the calculated bound one - particle level scheme and magnetic moments remain nearly the same as those presented here",
    ". see figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "neither the @xmath89 nor @xmath90 levels are obtained as one - particle resonant levels for the present potential .",
    "nevertheless , in figure 3 the approximate positions of those levels , which are extrapolated from the resonance energies obtained for slightly stronger spherical woods - saxon potentials , are indicated in figure 3 with the question mark .",
    "it is noted that when both the @xmath89 and @xmath9 levels appear as very low - lying resonant levels , the @xmath89 level may lie lower than the @xmath9 level .    the second lowest @xmath22=1/2@xmath40 level for @xmath91 denoted by the dotted curve in figure 3 can not continue for @xmath92 as a one - particle resonant level , because one - particle resonant levels with the major component of @xmath1=1 can not survive for higher @xmath93 values .",
    "the complicated behaviour of the resonant level expressed by the dotted curve for @xmath94 indicates clearly the influence of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 levels that do not explicitly appear in figure 3 .",
    "it is noted that for a pure @xmath9 shell the dotted curve increases almost linearly as @xmath95 increases for @xmath94 , just as a smooth extension of the curve for @xmath91 . around @xmath96",
    "the major component of the @xmath22=1/2@xmath40 level is @xmath1=1 .",
    "as @xmath97 increases @xmath93 increases , and the one - particle resonant level with the @xmath1=1 major component can hardly survive for @xmath98 mev , where both the width and @xmath93 rapidly increase .",
    "the major component of the one - particle resonant level expressed by the dotted curve for @xmath99 is @xmath1=3 , and consequently the resonant level is well defined with the reasonably small width .",
    "the near degeneracy of @xmath9 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 levels at @xmath34=0 can be the origin of possible deformation that appears in the system with a few weakly bound neutrons occupying the @xmath9-@xmath89-@xmath90 shell ( jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "namely , using the degeneracy the energy of a particular combination of the @xmath6 components can be made lower when deformation sets in .    in this region of  island of inversion",
    " there are two odd - n nuclei of which magnetic moments of the ground state are measured .",
    "the measured magnetic moment @xcite of the ground state ( i@xmath81=1/2@xmath29 ) of @xmath85mg@xmath86 is @xmath610.88355(15 ) @xmath80 , while it is reported in @xcite that the magnetic moment of @xmath88mg@xmath84 is @xmath610.7456(5 ) @xmath80 and the spin is 3/2 .",
    "though the parity of the ground state of @xmath100 mg is currently still under debate ( for example , see the recent @xmath34-decay study in @xcite ) , from table 2 the measured negative magnetic moment seems to have no other choice than negative parity for the ground state .",
    "it is remarked that the nilsson orbit that can be occupied by the 21st neutron for @xmath101 is either [ 330 1/2 ] or [ 202 3/2 ] or [ 321 3/2 ] within the reasonable variation of potential parameters .",
    "all of the three nilsson orbits lead to i=3/2 for the band - head spin . considering that we have fixed parameters @xmath54 and @xmath63 in the numerical calculation of magnetic moments , of which some standard values are used , the agreement of the calculated and measured values in table 2 is very good . in table 2",
    "calculated magnetic moments are tabulated for a given @xmath34 value , however , it should be noted that calculated values remain approximately constant , as far as the nilsson level is almost a straight line as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "odd - n nuclei with weakly bound neutrons in this region are currently under study and , to our knowledge , no measurements of magnetic moments are reported . examining e(2@xmath102 ) of even - even nuclei with n=28 , possible candidates for the deformed ground state are @xmath103si@xmath104 and @xmath105s@xmath104 , of which e(@xmath106 ) is 770 ( 19 ) @xcite and 1297(18 ) kev @xcite , respectively .",
    "there have been both some shell - model calculation and more elaborated many - body calculation , which suggested an oblate deformation for the nucleus @xmath107si .",
    "thus , in this region we show magnetic moments of odd - n nuclei evaluated for both prolate and oblate shape .",
    "though @xmath108 mg lies inside the neutron drip line , mg isotope is not discussed here , since none of the neighboring odd - n nuclei , @xmath109 mg and @xmath110 mg , is bound .    in figure 4",
    "we show the nilsson diagram , of which the parameters are approximately adjusted to @xmath111si@xmath112 .",
    "the reported @xmath87 value @xcite of this nucleus is 1.34 mev with a rather large ambiguity .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath34=0 the @xmath89 level lies only 1.2 mev higher than the @xmath9 level when the former is bound only by 0.28 mev .",
    "then , there may be a good chance for n=27 nuclei being deformed , since the neutron number n=28 may not work as a magic number .",
    "calculated magnetic moments are shown in table 3 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the magnetic moment of @xmath109si can be very different if it has an oblate shape .",
    "this is because the ( positive or ) almost vanishing value of the calculated magnetic moment comes from a subtle balance between the p@xmath113 and p@xmath114 components in the one - particle wave - function of the [ 301 1/2 ] orbit .",
    "that means , the calculated magnetic moments of oblate nuclei with n=27 depend on the size of the oblate deformation , as can be guessed from the curved ( and not straight - line ) nilsson level in figure 4 as a function of @xmath34 .    in the @xmath115-factor measurement of @xmath116s@xmath112 , which is an isotone of @xmath109si ,",
    "it is reported @xcite that the 320 kev isomeric state has @xmath117 and @xmath115=@xmath610.317(4 ) .",
    "this observation of the excited state indicates that the ground state of @xmath118s is deformed .    in figure 5 the nilsson diagram for neutrons",
    "is shown , of which the parameters are approximately adjusted to @xmath119s@xmath120 .",
    "the comparison between figure 4 and figure 5 clearly shows that the n=28 shell - gap at @xmath34=0 , namely the distance between the @xmath89 and @xmath9 levels , becomes increasingly smaller as the binding energy of the @xmath89 level approaches zero .",
    "this appreciable change of the n=28 shell - gap indicates that for a given neutron - number n@xmath12128 the si isotope has a better chance to be deformed than the s isotope .",
    "the nucleus @xmath122si@xmath120 is known to lie inside the neutron drip line , however , to our knowledge no spectroscopic information is yet available . in figure 5",
    "the asymptotic quantum numbers , [ n n@xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath39 ] , are written on the nilsson levels which may be occupied by the n=29th neutron , while calculated magnetic moments , in which the last odd neutron is placed in respective nilsson orbits , are given in table 4 .      neutron - drip - line nuclei in the region of n=40 are still far away from reaching experimentally .",
    "moreover , n=40 is not one of magic numbers in the j - j coupling shell model .",
    "nevertheless , we include this subsection , because ; ( a ) while there are no deformed n=40 nuclei along the stability line , recent experimental studies show relatively low energies ( @xmath121 500 kev ) of the first excited 2 + state of even - even nuclei of both @xmath123fe and @xmath124cr isotopes in the region of n @xmath121 40 .",
    "indeed , it is stated @xcite that the nucleus @xmath125cr@xmath126 may be a center of deformation in this region ; ( b ) some magnetic - moment measurements of isomeric states , the presence of which is not rare in this region , have already been reported .",
    "odd - n nuclei of fe and cr isotopes with n@xmath12140 around @xmath125cr@xmath126 have measured @xmath87 values of a few mev . in figure 6 the nilsson diagram is shown , which may be useful for the fe and cr isotopes with n@xmath12140 .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath90 and @xmath10 levels in figure 6 are nearly degenerate in contrast to the level scheme shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "this is because in the weaker potentials of the latter figures the @xmath90 level becomes increasingly lower relative to the @xmath10 level .",
    "calculated magnetic moments are given in table 5 , in which those given for @xmath34=0.25 remain nearly the same for @xmath34=0.35 .",
    "it may be speculated that the observed 387 kev isomeric state in @xmath127fe@xmath128 @xcite may be the @xmath129=1/2@xmath24 or 5/2@xmath24 state coming from the [ 301 1/2 ] or [ 303 5/2 ] intrinsic configuration if the isomeric state is deformed .",
    "examples of the change of neutron shell - structure for weakly bound neutrons are illustrated for neutron - rich nuclei with n@xmath1218 , 20 , 28 and 40 . both weakly - bound and resonant one - particle levels are properly calculated by directly solving the schrdinger equation in mesh of space coordinate with the appropriate boundary condition .",
    "magnetic moments of possibly deformed odd - n nuclei in the region are calculated using one - particle wave - functions in deformed woods - saxon potentials .    among the examples taken in the present paper , the near degeneracy of the weakly - bound @xmath71 and @xmath72 levels ( figure 2 ) , that of the one - particle resonant @xmath9 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 levels ( figure 3 ) , and that of the @xmath10 and @xmath90 levels bound by several mev ( figure 6 ) are the most clear - cut examples of the unique shell - structure , which is very different from what is known for traditional stable nuclei .",
    "it is hoped that more experiments will pin down the unique shell structure . in the present paper",
    "we have argued that the shell structure may lead to , among others ; ( a ) the appearance of the n=16 magic number @xcite ; ( b ) possible deformed shapes of @xmath130be @xcite , @xmath82c , and @xmath131c ; ( c ) deformed nuclei in the island of inversion around n @xmath121 20 ; ( d ) the disappearance of the magic number n=28 and possible deformation of some neutron - drip - line nuclei with n@xmath12128 .    calculated magnetic moments of the deformed ground states of @xmath75be , @xmath82c , @xmath132 mg , and @xmath100 mg are in good agreement with already measured ones , while the values of @xmath53 and @xmath63 have not been adjusted to individual nuclei . except the case of @xmath75be where the unique magnetic moments of the d@xmath133-s@xmath114 mixed neutron wave - functions play a role , both measured and calculated values of magnetic moment are significantly different from what is expected from spherical shape and ,",
    "thus , can be used as a good identification of deformation .",
    "the measurement of magnetic moments of other neutron - drip - line nuclei is strongly wanted .",
    "magnetic moments estimated in the present work are applicable not only to the ground state of the odd - n nuclei studied but also to excited or isomeric states in the neighboring nuclei .",
    "the presence of isomeric states is often expected in the region of n@xmath12128 and n@xmath12140 neutron - rich nuclei due to the coexistence of spherical and deformed shape or the unique shell - structure .",
    "magnetic moments presently estimated for a given deformation remain nearly the same when one - particle energies in the nilsson diagram vary almost linearly as a function of deformation , because the structure of single - particle wave - functions in those cases remains nearly independent of deformation .",
    "it should be remarked that the change of the shell structure described in the present paper is different from ( and independent of ) the one coming from the neutron - proton tensor force @xcite , which is currently very fashionable for being an origin of shell - structure change .",
    "the latter depends on the proton number of respective nuclei when the neutron shell - structure is discussed .",
    "moreover , the effect of the tensor force is usually estimated using harmonic oscillator wave - functions in the shell model and , thus , the effect of weakly binding is not included .",
