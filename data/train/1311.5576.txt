    "the tools presented are general enough to be able to deal with more sophisticated and promising atomic clock setups including many simultaneously evolving atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "however , a rigorous connection between our results and the performance of the actual atomic clock , requires the study of the allan variance , instead of instantaneous variance , as a figure of merit .",
    "the allan variance takes into account the effects of the correlations between subsequent interrogation steps , i.e. @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which is more adequate in the quantification of the performance of atomic clocks but at the same time makes the study of the optimal bayesian strategies much more involved .",

    "the former is the case for example for gaussian states , where mean position is the parameter to be estimated in which case @xmath52 is proportional to the position operator .",
