    "the large majority of the precision detectors of the muon spectrometer of the atlas experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be monitored drift tube ( mdt ) chambers .",
    "these chambers consist of 2 multilayers , each built of 3 or 4 layers of densely packed drift tubes mounted on a support frame made of aluminum ( compare figure  [ mdt.fig ] ) .",
    "the drift tubes  which are also made of aluminum  have an outer diameter of 3 cm and a wall thickness of 400 @xmath4 m ; in the middle of each tube a gold - plated w - re anode wire of 50 @xmath4 m diameter is stretched .",
    "the anode wire is positioned only at the two tube ends by precision end - plugs ; the sag of each chamber can be adjusted to follow the sag of the wire along the tube .",
    "the drift tubes are operated at a pressure of 3 bar absolute with an ar : co@xmath5=93:7 gas mixture at a gas gain of @xmath6 . the area covered by a complete chamber ranges from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "a total of 1194 mdt chambers will be used in atlas  @xcite .     a schematic view of an atlas mdt chamber .",
    "also indicated are the optical paths of the geometry monitoring system ( in - plane alignment ) . ]    in collaboration with the max planck institute ( mpi ) for physics , munich university ( lmu ) is responsible for the construction of 88 mdt chambers of type bos ( barrel outer small  the second largest type used in the atlas barrel region ) which consists of 432 drift tubes , arranged in @xmath9 layers of 72 tubes , and has a size of @xmath10 .",
    "the chambers are built with high mechanical precision at mpi  @xcite and are then commissioned and calibrated at the cosmic ray measurement facility of munich university .",
    "the main objectives of the cosmic ray facility are to test the chambers , to map the positions of the tube layers and of individual anode wires within the chambers , and to gain experience in the operation of the chambers and the calibration procedures .",
    "an important design goal of the atlas muon spectrometer is the standalone measurement capability of muon momenta up to 1tev with a relative error of less than 10% .",
    "this leads to the requirement that the anode wire positions within the mdt chambers must be known to within @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "a schematic view of the cosmic ray measurement facility .",
    "the individual components are described in the text . ]    a schematic view of the cosmic ray measurement facility is shown in figure  [ fig : setup ] . the whole setup is located in a climatized hall to ensure stable environmental conditions during the measurements .",
    "we define a right handed coordinate system , the @xmath12 coordinate in the direction along the wires , @xmath13 perpendicular to the wires in the chamber plane , and @xmath14 perpendicular to the chamber plane pointing upwards .",
    "three mdt chambers are operated simultaneously in the facility .",
    "two of them , the so - called reference chambers , encompass the third chamber  which is to be tested  and provide track information for cosmic ray muons .",
    "the anode wire positions of the reference chambers have been mapped with a precision of @xmath15 with an x - ray tomograph at cern  @xcite .",
    "a coincidence of the three scintillator layers in the hodoscopes above and below the mdt chambers provides the trigger .",
    "the upper hodoscope consists of one layer of scintillator counters , the lower of two staggered layers displaced by half the width of a counter .",
    "only muons with a momentum greater than 600mev pass the 34 cm iron absorber above the lower hodoscope and can generate a trigger signal .",
    "the trigger logic is divided into 5 segments along the @xmath12 coordinate to limit the inclination of the muons in the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane .",
    "the arrangement of the scintillator bars allows the measurement of muon tracks in the @xmath12 direction with a precision of 8 cm .",
    "the time of the muon transition is determined by the lower hodoscope with a precision of better than 800ps .",
    "the average trigger rate is about 70hz .",
    "the streamer tubes at the bottom of the setup are used together with the lower reference chamber to determine the multiple scattering angle in the @xmath13-@xmath14 plane in the iron absorber .",
    "this angle is used in combination with the angle between the track segments in the two reference chambers to estimate the momentum of the muon .",
    "two contact free alignment systems are used to continuously monitor the positions of all mdt chambers : the position of the reference chambers relative to each other is measured with an optical alignment system consisting of eight rasnik sensors  @xcite , the position of the test chamber with respect to the upper mdt chamber with eight capacitive sensors  @xcite .",
    "both systems have a precision of better than @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the chamber - to - chamber alignment , the internal chamber geometry is also monitored with integrated rasnik sensors ( compare figure  [ mdt.fig ] ) .",
    "the position measurement in the mdt chambers is based on the measurement of the drift time of the electrons ( from ionization by the incident muon along its trajectory ) to the anode wire .",
    "the drift time is determined with respect to the external trigger system and translated to the impact radius ( distance from the anode wire ) via the so - called @xmath17-@xmath18 relation ( see section  [ rt - rel - sec ] ) ; the drift tubes are only sensitive to the track coordinates in a plane perpendicular to the anode wire , not along it .",
    "the drift of the electrons depends on the gas composition , the gas density , and the electric field applied ( i.e.  the operating voltage ) , and is therefore characteristic of the gas mixture and the operating conditions .    after correcting for the signal propagation times along the anode wire and in the electronics and cables , the distributions of drift times",
    "are used as a first check that each tube is functioning as expected and that the detector response is homogeneous . for the simple case of uniform illumination of a tube ,",
    "the density of hits at a given drift time is proportional to the drift velocity at the corresponding radius .",
    "events with more than one charged particle passing through the setup would lead to ambiguities in the hodoscope time measurement .",
    "therefore , exactly one hit in the upper hodoscope and one pair of hits in overlapping counters in the lower hodoscope are demanded , which rejects 15% of all triggers ( see table  [ cutflowtable1.tab ] ) .",
    "the edges of the drift time spectra are parameterized  @xcite with the functions @xmath19 as shown in figure  [ fermi_fit ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to the rates of accidental hits , @xmath22 to the height of the spectrum , and @xmath23 to the mid - time and @xmath24 to the steepness of the rising edge of the spectrum , which is determined by the resolution of the drift tube near the anode wire .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath25 is the middle of the trailing edge of the spectrum and @xmath26 its steepness , which is determined by the decrease in pulse height near the tube wall .",
    "the parameterization with @xmath27 accounts for the slope of the spectrum before its trailing edge that is due to the decrease of the drift velocity with increasing radius .     a typical drift time spectrum , normalized to one entry .",
    "the fitted functions are explained in the text . ]",
    "the maximum drift time , defined as @xmath28 , is characteristic of the drift properties of a tube .",

    "b ) the corresponding pull distribution . ]    as part of the chamber quality control programme , it is checked that all tubes have the same drift time spectrum characteristics within errors , compare figure  [ dt_dis]b .",
    "the relation between the measured drift time and the corresponding drift radius ( relation ) is determined without the help of external spacial detectors and without assumptions on uniform tube illumination .",
    "after the check described in section  [ sec_dt_fit ] , it is assumed that all tubes of an mdt chamber have the same @xmath17-@xmath18 relation .",
    "events with two hits at small drift times ( @xmath30 ) in one mdt chamber are selected . by assuming that the muon went through the two corresponding anode wires and that the trajectory of the muon is a straight line , the impact radii in the other tubes of the chamber can be calculated",
    ". this procedure yields drift times for a discrete set of drift radii .",
    "the number of such points  typically 16  is determined by the geometry of the chamber and the angular acceptance of the trigger .",
    "in addition to these points , the drift times corresponding to @xmath31 and to the inner tube radius are determined by the fit to the drift time spectra described in section  [ sec_dt_fit ] .",
    "the @xmath17-@xmath18 relation is then approximated by a linear interpolation between the measured values .",

    "the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are determined for each chamber by minimizing the @xmath37 function @xmath38 where the index @xmath39 runs over all tubes contributing to the track segment , @xmath40 is the distance of the track segment to the wire , @xmath41 is the measured drift radius , and @xmath42 is the resolution of the tube for the given radius . at a test beam measurement using an external reference tracking system of silicon strip detectors",
    "the intrinsic single tube resolution was determined to be around @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the tubes contributing to a track segment are selected by choosing one tube with a hit in each layer of the chamber , which is a sample of six tubes . from the impact radii in the two outermost tubes of this sample four possible track segment candidates",
    "are derived .",
    "if the difference between the distance of such a candidate to the wire and the measured drift radius does not exceed 2 mm in any of the other tubes , a track segment is fitted using this sample .",
    "if more than one track segment is found , the one with the smallest @xmath37 is used .",
    "if no track segment is found , the procedure is repeated with subsamples of five tubes .",
    "the mdt chambers in the cosmic ray facility are aligned mechanically with a precision of about @xmath44 m . a much more precise estimate of their relative positions",
    "is then obtained by comparing the muon track segments reconstructed in each chamber .",
    "the optical and capacitive alignment systems are used to verify that the setup does not move significantly during the data taking period . in the future",
    ", the alignment information will be included in the analysis to correct for time - dependent position shifts of the chambers .",
    "the positions of the two reference chambers are measured relative to the test chamber .",
    "@xmath45    a shift @xmath46 of a reference chamber with respect to the test chamber results in a systematic shift between the track segments in the reference and test chamber and can be obtained from the average over all events , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the track segment parameters defined in equation  ( [ track.eqn ] ) .",
    "they are determined with a precision of 1@xmath4 m .    a shift @xmath50 results in a relative shift of the track segments depending on the slope @xmath51 .",
    "it is determined from a linear fit to the distribution of @xmath52 versus @xmath51 with an error of 10@xmath4 m .",
    "a shift @xmath53 along the @xmath12 coordinate can be ignored , as the mdt chambers are not sensitive to such a shift along the direction of their anode wires .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath54 of a reference chamber around the @xmath12 axis is given by the systematic deviation of the two track segment slopes as @xmath55 a precision of @xmath56 is achieved .    to determine the angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 corresponding to rotations of the reference chamber around the @xmath13 and @xmath14 axes , the @xmath12",
    "coordinate measurement of the hodoscope is used .",

    "the energy of cosmic muons traversing the cosmic ray measurement facility is estimated from multiple scattering  which depends on the muon momentum  in the chambers and the iron absorber .",
    "if @xmath62 designates the slope of the track segment reconstructed in the upper reference chamber and @xmath63 the slope of the track segment reconstructed by the lower reference chamber , the distribution of @xmath64 will be the wider the lower the muon energy . the standard deviation",
    "@xmath65 has been determined as a function of the muon energy by means of a monte carlo simulation and can be parameterized as  @xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , the deviation @xmath70 of the position measured with the streamer tubes from the prediction obtained from the track segment in the lower reference chamber depends on the muon energy : for its width @xmath71 , a monte carlo simulation yields the values @xmath72  mm , @xmath73  mm , and @xmath74 .",

    "this estimator is biased and has a limited resolution but is still useful for a selection of high momentum muons .",
    "in this section , the method for the measurement of anode wire positions is presented . to determine wire positions ,",
    "the muon track segments in the reference chambers are extrapolated into the test chamber , and the drift radii measured in the test chamber are compared with the track predictions .",
    "the cosmic ray measurement facility is particularly sensitive to displacements @xmath80 of the wires in the chamber plane . from this",
    ", a shift of entire tube layers in the @xmath13 direction and the mean spacing @xmath81 between the wires within a layer can also be determined .",
    "wire displacements @xmath82 in the plane perpendicular to the chamber are accessible via tracks with different inclinations @xmath51 ( cf",
    ".  equation  ( [ track.eqn ] ) ) .",
    "this measurement is less precise than the @xmath80 determination owing to the limited angular acceptance of the trigger and the angular distribution of cosmic muons . during chamber production , @xmath14 displacement and tilts of entire tube layers",
    "are more difficult to control than individual wire displacements @xmath82 with respect to the layer .",
    "therefore , the @xmath14 displacement for each tube layer is also measured .",
    "the measurements are performed at both ends of the chamber by selecting muons which passed the tested chamber within one meter of the corresponding end of the chamber using the hodoscope information . because the wires are only supported at the tube ends and since the sag of the anode wires is known from wire tension measurements these two measurements completely determine the wire position .",
    "events with one reconstructed charged particle are selected as described in section  [ sec_dt_fit ] . for the further analysis , the event selection proceeds in two steps :",
    "first , the reconstructed track segments are subjected to a set of cuts , and second , the individual hits in the tubes must pass certain quality criteria .",
    "the presence of a reconstructed track segment with at least 5 hits is required in each of the three mdt chambers .",
    "the track segments must also roughly match , i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this ensures that the track segments are not affected by tubes in which delta rays distorted the drift time measurement .",
    "the remaining events are called good tracks . for the determination of wire positions , tracks with high muon momentum",
    "are desirable to limit the effects from multiple scattering .",
    "thus , the estimated muon energy is required to be larger than @xmath85 .",
    "the efficiencies of these track cuts are given in table  [ cutflowtable1.tab ] .",
    "tubes in the test chamber with hits generated by delta rays would affect the measurement of the wire position , and are therefore rejected : it is demanded that the tube have contributed to a track segment in the test chamber . also , a loose cut on the difference between the radius prediction from the reconstructed track segments and the measured drift radius is made . for the track segment reconstructed in the test chamber",
    "this cut is at 0.7 mm , while it is at 1.5 mm for the predicted radius from the reference track segments extrapolated into the test chamber .",
    "the efficiencies of these cuts are given in table  [ cutflowtable2.tab ] .",
    "they are very close to 100% and thus do not bias the wire position measurement .",
    "the reconstructed reference chamber track segments are extrapolated into the test chamber and the drift radius measured in the test chamber is compared with the prediction from those track segments .",
    "the weighted average @xmath86 of the drift radius predictions from the two track segments @xmath87 is taken , where each uncertainty @xmath88 ( @xmath89 for the track segment in the upper and lower reference chamber ) depends on the extrapolation distance from the reference chamber and the estimated muon momentum ( to account for the uncertainty from multiple scattering ) .",
    "the value of @xmath88 is about @xmath90 m for the reference chamber closer to the tube hit and ranges from 350 to 800 @xmath4 m for the farther chamber .     a sketch explaining the method for the measurement of wire displacements .",
    "a muon ( dashed line ) passing a tube with a wire that is displaced from the nominal position by @xmath80 in the @xmath13 direction and @xmath91 in the @xmath14 direction will lead to a measured drift radius @xmath92 , while @xmath86 is predicted by the reference chambers relative to the nominal wire position . ]",
    "if a given wire is displaced by @xmath80 in the @xmath13 direction and @xmath82 in the @xmath14 direction , the measured drift radius @xmath92 in the tube will show a systematic deviation @xmath93 from the predicted reference radius , @xmath94 as shown in figure  [ deltarsketch.fig ] .",
    "the displacement @xmath82 of an individual anode wire is determined from the slope in a linear fit to the distribution of @xmath93 vs.  @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath14 displacement of an entire tube layer and its tilt corresponding to a rotation about the @xmath12 axis are determined from the distribution of measured @xmath82 values of all tubes as a function of their @xmath13 coordinate is taken to be the nominal wire position . because of the large chamber width , this approximation does not bias the result . ] .",
    "a linear fit to this @xmath82 distribution is performed separately for each layer .",
    "the offset and slope of the fitted line are taken to be the @xmath14 displacement and tilt of the layer , respectively .    in the further analysis , each wire",
    "is assigned the measured @xmath14 position of the layer at the nominal @xmath13 wire position .",
    "the single wire position measurement is used for wires where it deviates from the layer position by more than 3 standard deviations .      using the @xmath14 position measurement described above",
    ", the displacement @xmath80 of an anode wire is obtained as @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the predicted radius corrected for the wire @xmath14 position and the residual displacement @xmath97 after correction is of the order of the resolution of the @xmath14 position measurement .",
    "the average of the track slopes @xmath98 is direction during data taking . ]",
    "@xmath99 , the largest value of @xmath100 for a single tube being @xmath101 . therefore , the systematic error introduced in the last approximation of equation  ( [ deltaraverage.eqn ] ) is typically much smaller than @xmath102 times the resolution on the @xmath14 position , which does not limit the @xmath80 measurement .    in the chamber plane ,",
    "the nominal wire positions can be described by a grid of the form @xmath103 where @xmath34 denotes the index of the tube in the layer , @xmath104 the offset of the layer position relative to the other layers in the same chamber , and @xmath81 the mean distance between two neighbouring wires .",
    "fitting the function in equation  ( [ grid - eq ] ) to the distribution of the wire positions of one tube layer yields the offset @xmath105 and the mean distance @xmath81 for that layer .      in order to test the method described above ,",
    "one of the few chambers which have been scanned by the x - ray tomograph at cern has been used as a test chamber .",
