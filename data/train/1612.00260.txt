    "the idea to treat information retrieval , or , in general , data and knowledge proceeding as physical processes has long tradition , in particular , these ideas gave rise to quantum computation .",
    "in the last decades a research was carried out on viewing usual ( non - quantum ) information deals as physical processes @xcite .",
    "more than 100 years ago along with the growth of the precision of physical measurements quantum mechanics was born .",
    "now , along with the development of world wide web and the emergence of immense data corpora , new conceptual challenges arise . the amount of the existing data together with the possibility to generate new data on - the - fly give rise to purely theoretical inquiries whose practical goals was to boost the performance of search engines .",
    "while the notion of `` performance '' in this context remains ambiguous , the efforts were made to build a general framework for information retrieval in newly emerged environment .",
    "it was observed  in practice , by trials  that the performance of search algorithms may be sometimes improved if one follow a `` wrong '' probabilistic model , that is , recalculate probabilities in discordance with kolmogorovian laws .",
    "similar situation takes place in quantum theory , which gave rise to quantum probability .",
    "furthermore , quantum probabilistic approach was successfully applied to information retrieval @xcite .",
    "the development of world wide web , the emergence of massive accessible data sets gave rise to a kind of new realities .",
    "like conventional physics , information retrieval deals with events and , as it was recently discovered , the statistical dependencies observed ( that is , obtained in experiments ) in information retrieval processes may be not only non - classical , but also demonstrate stronger - than - quantum correlations . from a broader conceptual perspective , information retrieval in its current state can be treated as a factory producing various realities .",
    "i intentionally reduce the picture to that extent that from the point of view of ` end user ' , modern sophisticated physical laboratory is just a man - computer interaction .",
    "the user affects the environment , the environment reacts somehow , the user , being to this or that extent satisfied ( this is to be quantified as well ) refines its query according to some underlying principles .",
    "the above mentioned ` underlying principles ' are based on certain picture of reality which need not be classical , or even quantum .",
    "the suggested picture of operationalistically perceived environment requires a consistent realistic framework . in recent years",
    ", a formalism based on topos theory was developed meeting this requirement . in this essay ,",
    "the appropriate mathematical models based on topos theory and giving rise to event structures similar to those forming traditional spacetime , are overviewed .    in the meantime , the attempts to build a consistent and in some sense `` realistic '' theory of quantum gravity faced severe problems .",
    "the reason was that the very notion of a single , pre - defined underlying configuration space is strange for the theory , it required a formalism dealing with varying or emerging spacetime .",
    "the problems in both information retrieval and quantum gravity were of similar kind  how to make space and time secondary , derived , rather than fundamental entities .",
    "in order to explain the observed non - classicality , the idea of non - uniqueness of the event space within a given probabilistic model was put forward @xcite .",
    "however the occurring `` wrong '' probabilities behaved sometimes neither in quantum , nor in classical way .",
    "the advances in quite different areas signal the need for a unified conceptual framework .",
    "an essential breakthrough in this direction was made by introducing topos approach to physical theories . in this essay",
    "possible applications of topos theory to information retrieval are highlighted .",
    "in this section primitive _ empirical statements _ or _ propositions _ about automata @xcite are introduced .",
    "such experimental statements form the basis of the formal investigation of the corresponding logics .",
    "in particular , there exist automata for which validation of one empirical statement makes impossible the validation of another empirical statement and _ vice versa _ , as it was first pointed out by moore @xcite , which makes them similar to quantum systems .",
    "thereby , one decisive feature of the set - up is the _ intrinsic _ character of the measurement process : the automaton is treated as a black box with known description but unknown initial state .",
    "automata experiments are conducted by applying an input sequence and observing the output sequence .",
    "the conventional state identification problem @xcite is to obtain information about an unknown initial state .",
    "one may think of it as choosing at random a single automaton from an automata ensemble which differ only by their initial state .",
    "the task then is to find out which was the initial state of the chosen automaton .",
    "staying within the instrumentalist framework , we may ask if a classical object may demonstrate elements of quantum behavior .",
    "david finkelstein provided a simple example of a classical automaton , which demonstrated quantum features on the level of the structure of the set of observable properties @xcite . like in quantum system , every measurement on its state affected the state itself , so the logic of accessible properties of finkelstein s automaton with the graph    @xmath0 was similar to that of a quantum particle with spin @xmath1 . @xmath2{$\\emptyset$ } } \\put(62.33,55.00){\\makebox(0,0)[cc]{$\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ } } \\put(18.00,30.00){\\makebox(0,0)[lc]{$\\{2,3,4\\}$ } } \\put(38,30.00){\\makebox(0,0)[lc]{$\\{1,3,4\\}$ } } \\put(73.66,30.00){\\makebox(0,0)[lc]{$\\{1,2,4\\}$ } } \\put(93.66,30.00){\\makebox(0,0)[lc]{$\\{1,2,3\\}$ } } \\end{picture}\\ ] ] in the above example , it is not necessary to input sequences containing more than one symbol , since the non - final states are not distinguished by the output function .",
    "since then a consistent theory of finite automata simulating quantum systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom was developed @xcite .",
    "a more general framework was developed on both technical and operationalistic level by aerts with co - authors , including , in particular , study of cognition from a quantum perspective @xcite .",
    "anyway , on this step the emerging virtual structures was on the level of the logic of accessible properties , or , in other words , on the level of configuration space rather than fully fledged space - time .",
    "the basic idea of this approach , put forward in @xcite and developed in @xcite is the following . a smooth continuous manifold @xmath3 is considered , called _ information retrieval space _ ( ir space ) .",
    "note that @xmath3 is neither a document space , nor a query space ; instead , it has a more fundamental and unstructured nature .",
    "it may be thought of as the set of all transmitted bits .",
    "the elements of @xmath3 are all the same ; they have no structure .",
    "this is a complete analogy to the points of spacetime , or the configuration space in physical theories .    to be more",
    "specific,@xmath3 is an analog to physical spacetime .",
    "both documents and queries re placed into @xmath3 , providing them with both temporal and spatial dimensions . as a consequence ,",
    "the idea that a document may change in time is automatically incorporated in the theory .",
    "the second consequence is that the static documents , and those generated on - the - fly , are described as entities of exactly the same nature , differing only in ` shape ' in our ir spacetime @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , since the points of @xmath3 are uniform , they can be treated as events .",
    "the ir process itself is represented by trajectories in @xmath3 which show the behavior of users .",
    "when we are speaking about a huge community of users , we no longer treat their behavior as intelligent : this gives us the right to shift the focus of our research from the task of finding a good way to satisfy users requests to the task of analyzing typical user behavior . from this perspective ,",
    "a typical user of a search environment is not more intelligent than an elementary particle or a molecule , and we may apply the good old principle of least action , which stems from the work of fermat and euler .",
    "this principle proved its efficiency by providing simple and strongly predictive models .",
    "the standard ir paradigm treats the ir process as a search .",
    "that is , the initial condition is posing a query , then , according to this or that formula , the indexed documents are ranked .",
    "subsequently , the results are delivered to the user according to the ranking .",
    "but , typically , the user never makes a single query and the process is usually progressive . after parsing the results and considering their relevance ,",
    "the user poses further queries , repeating the process iteratively based on relevance feedback .    building",
    "ir space is getting above these particularities .",
    "the notion of relevance feedback is replaced by the least action :        figure 1 . a point on ir surface together with users intention vector .",
    "the sequence of user s actions is interpreted as geodesic motion .",
    "the dynamics replace the notion of relevance , and the displacement of a user from point @xmath4 to point @xmath5 is what replaces relevance feedback making it , in a sense , a _ relevance feedforward_.    let us briefly overview how ir space is built on the basis of query log analysis .",
    "let us first produce the ` flesh ' of ir space .",
    "its elementary constituent , a point , is a click : a query / http request together with a body response ( html page accessed by a result link ) . in order to specify a particular geodesic , we must specify the initial conditions which are the initial position @xmath6 and the initial ` intention ' @xmath7 .",
    "a typical user clickstream will be represented as a line , whereby the points of the line @xmath8 are associated with the state of knowledge the user has gained from interpreting the retrieved information until that point .    a clickstream is a progressive , ` continuous ' sequence of user queries and responses which have a definite start and end .",
    "the result of step 1 is a collection of clickstreams , an ordered sequences of points :        figure 2 .",
    "points on clickstreams are ordered by timestamps of clicks .    at next step ,",
    "the discrete pre - space @xmath3 is created . in the given collection of clickstreams ,",
    "their points are ordered and we know the distances between them .",
    "we assume that we use certain distance between points of the threads ( any particular relevance formula can be applied ) . this way the clickstreams acquire metric :        figure 3 .",
    "clickstreams acquire metrics .",
    "the next step turns the structure from spatial to spatiotemporal by creating layers ( analogs of spacelike hypersurfaces ) .",
    "start with points with label 0 ( this will be a starting layer ) , and , using the same distance function , place them as points on a metric space",
    ". then we pass to sequential label 1 , and form the same discrete metric space , and so on . as a result",
    ", we have a sequence of layers labeled @xmath9 , forming altogether a discrete metric space :        figure 4 . creating transversal layers .",
    "the next step completes the skeleton with the ` bones ' linking nearest neighbors , now irrespective of the thread , to which they belong        figure 5 . forming the discrete skeleton .    in the formalism proposed in @xcite the dimension @xmath10 of the future ir space",
    "is set _ ad hoc _ ( since it has a spatiotemporal structure , one dimension is reserved for the temporal parameter and @xmath11 for ` spatial ' . )",
    "once @xmath11 is chosen , each layer is projected on an @xmath11-dimensional space , a foliation is formed , labeled @xmath12 , together with threads , which are retained fromthe first step .",
    "finally , the resulting space is treated as ir space .",
    "ir space is built .",
    "artificial neural networks ( anns ) have gained increasing interest , finding applications in various domains such as business planning , medicine , engineering , geology , and physics .",
    "anns have shown remarkable efficiency in solving tasks related to forecasting , planning , control and classification .",
    "anns are a natural and intuitive field to explore , as they draw inspiration from the structure of real biological systems .",
    "one of the basic tasks of neural networks is to function as perceptrons , that is , to recognize signals for which we have no structural theory  for instance , to recognize visual patterns .",
    "we shall deal with multilayered feedforward nns , such as @xmath13 that is , their nodes can be arranged in layers so that ( i ) no nodes in a given layer communicate , and ( ii ) the signals propagate only consecutively , via layers .

    "is chosen and then trained via input of known patterns and subsequent adjustment of network parameters ( transition functions ) .",
    "output signals are correlated with patterns from different classes , to be well - separated with respect to certain criterion .",
    "the most popular method to adjust transition functions is error backpropagation .",
    "signal propagation in the linear approximation can be viewed as a matrix multiplication , which reduces to a number of arithmetic operations .",
    "the more links there are between neurons , the more computational resources are consumed by the process of pattern recognition . in order for a neural network to be faster",
    ", we should seek sparser configurations .",
    "therefore , the criterion for ` good matching ' should also take performance into consideration .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the core idea of the suggested approach is to convert the primary component of artificial neural networks  directed acyclic graphs ( dags )  into a more general structure , which naturally complies with quantum parallelism .",
    "the latter inevitably means that this should be a linear structure in order to support superpositions . in @xcite",
    "the idea to replace dag by appropriate sets of linear matrices ( associated further with appropriate quantum variables ) was suggested .",

    "standard performance criteria are used , such as root mean square error ( rmse ) between targets and outputs of the neural network , the correlation ( called r - value ) between the outputs and targets an so on , the are only reclassified in terms of unitary matrices and matrix operations .",
    "the main peculiarity is that the result of training optimization is then a matrix , or a set of matrices , rather than a directed acyclic graph , as is seen in a standard , ` literal ' approach . this way _ adaptive artificial neural networks ( aanns )",
    "_ are introduced which , strictly speaking , are not networks .",
    "the topology of a feedforward artificial neural network , @xmath14 , is described by the _ template matrix _ of the appropriate directed acyclic graph ( dag ) , which is formed as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for a wildcard  any number , and the set of such numerical matrices form an algebra @xcite as it is closed under multiplication .",
    "the main property of @xmath17 is that the synaptic weights ` follow ' it  namely , if @xmath18 , then @xmath19 .",
    "this differs from the standard description in terms of adjacency matrices , and the difference is that the matrix is not numeric .",
    "the simplest example is provided by a two - vertex dag with one arrow @xmath20 whose template matrix is @xmath21 in general , taking various matrices by substituting the asterisk in template matrix by numbers we may form various products .",
    "the resulting set of matrices is called the _",

    "the key point of the spatialization procedure @xcite is the following : consider the full matrix algebra @xmath22 as a linear space . from this perspective , the rota algebras are just linear subspaces of @xmath22 . having a procedure which  starting from a subset of @xmath22  creates a topological space , providing the capability to discuss superposed configurations of differing neural networks . in this section",
    "we present a procedure which  starting from a given subspace of @xmath22  produces a set , and endows it with a topology that can be associated with certain acyclic directed graphs .    in brief",

    "but non - classical does not necessarily means quantum , and a broader conceptual background is needed to build a uniform theory .",
    "the program of building an operationalistic framework for empirically verified theories ( we may call them physical theories , but they should be understood in a broader sense ) was successfully carried out in the last decade , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "topos theory is a vast , broadly developed area of mathematics , there is no need to define it in detail in this essay . a very good introduction to the subject is @xcite",
    ", the reviews of applications of topos theory to physics can be found in a general context @xcite and specifically for quantum gravity in @xcite .",
    "a loose definition of a topos is a category with special properties , which make a topos `` look like '' the category of sets , @xmath63 , in the sense that any mathematical operation that can be done in set theory has an analogue in a general topos .",
    "what is essential is that the conceptual needs for both theoretical physics and information retrieval are in accordance :    * spatialisation ( in whatever sense ) is needed in order to make theory realistic and experimentally verifiable * in order to be in a position to _ dasein _ , a kind of classical snapshot of a system is to be taken . * to create the arena for events , a gelfand - like spatialisation is required * to obtain a reasonable gelfand spectrum , a commutative subalgebra , associated with a particular context , should be specified .",
    "this scheme is common for building a probabilistic - like model in any operationalist environment . to conclude , topos paradigm provides a formalism , which , given a physical system ( or , more generally , an operationalistic environment ) associates with it a bunch of virtual context - dependent configuration ( or sample ) spaces .",
    "we see that the experimental results over large data collections demonstrate features of quantum behavior . in order to mimic quantum indeterminacy ,",
    "the access to complete knowledge about the system was artificially restricted . but this phenomenon is generic for information retrieval !",
    "the point is that search engines store some limited data about the documents rather than the documents themselves .",
    "this is a natural restriction for the access to the documents to be complete , which , in turn , could be the reason for the observed non - classicality .",
    "the task for ir is to range search results",
    ". the standard probability - based approach may be too straightforward and not effective sometimes .",
    "a more subtle evaluations like propensities are invoked .",
    "these propensities must be somehow quantified .",
    "the topos approach is flexible enough to provide various scales for propensities . within it , `` probabilities ''",
    "may not lie with the @xmath64 $ ] interval , furthermore , it admits models where `` probabilities '' are not totally ordered .",
    "the existence of non - comparable properties is natural for ir . but these are practical issues , which i do not inquire here .    to conclude , i would like to formulate the main message of this essay .",
    "there are different physical theories . to evaluate them",
    ", one needs to know what each of these theories has to do with _ the _ reality .",
    "my claim is that nowadays we witness the creation of realities , these realities become to greater and greater extent real in comparison with _ the _ reality . as a consequence ,",
    "we are now in a position to say that certain theory describes _ a _ reality . what happens with a physical theory if it turns out that its predictions are disproved by experiment ?",
    "the theory is to be rejected .",
    "the reason to reject it is that it does not describe the reality . in this essay",
    "i show that nowadays we witness how a new harbor for the abandoned theories is being built .",
    "the factory producing these realities increases its output , and , therefore , abandoned physical theories , which were proved to be falsified by experiment , may find the new life .",
