    "we find evidence for variability of some galactic nuclei in the @xmath6 bands on a timescale of tenths of a second .",
    "byrne & wayman ( 1975 ) first carried out a search for optical flashes in the direction of the center of the galaxy in the early 1970s .",
    "this experiment was the first attempt to find an outburst of radiation that may accompany such energetic events as pulses of gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "recent studies of coincident events in the gravitational wave detectors explorer and nautilus ( astone et al.2002 ) give an observed rate around one event per day .",
    "such events correspond to an isotropic conversion of @xmath7 into gw energy for sources located in our galaxy .",
    "this gives us some hope of detecting optical flares from the cores of other galaxies . to detect flares with confidence , it is desirable to carry out a high - speed monitoring by two or more remote telescopes synchronously .",
    "we present some preliminary results for two objects , the galaxies m85 ( s0 , @xmath8mag ) and ngc 7331 ( sb , @xmath9mag ) .",
    "both of these show very bright inner regions suitable for high - speed monitoring in the optical on timescales as short as @xmath10s with adequate signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "observations were made in the @xmath6 bands with the 2-m rcc telescope at peak terskol and the crimean 1.25-m and 50-inch telescopes equipped with high - speed photon - counting photometers .",
    "for the majority of these observations , these telescopes were operated synchronously .",
    "the nuclei of galaxies were observed with large focal - plane diaphragms ( from 26  to 50 ) .",
    "second channels of the photometers were used for monitoring comparison stars . in all",
    ", we obtained 98 minutes of photometric data sampled at 100 hz .",
    "figure 1 shows an unusual burst in the optical registered while observing the core of the galaxy m85 during a 1 hour - long run .",
    "the burst consists of a sudden onset with a characteristic time of less than @xmath11ms , with the subsequent quasi - exponential decay within approximately @xmath12s .",
    "its amplitude amounts to 2.5mag in the @xmath0 band .",
    "no bursts were found in the control star that was observed simultaneously .",
    "the maximum flux is equivalent to the flux from a @xmath13mag star at the zenith . according to the data given by allen ( 1973 ) ,",
    "the expected mean rate at the zenith for meteors brighter than @xmath14mag in a 39  field ( focal - plane diaphragm ) is @xmath15hr@xmath16 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that a faint meteor did not cause the flare event in m85 .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out that such an event may be produced by some other unknown phenomenon , e.g. , by a cosmic - ray event .    during the high - speed monitoring with the two crimean telescopes operating synchronously",
    ", we also found one coincident event occurring in ngc 7331 during a 38 minute - long run .",
    "this event corresponds to a short burst with duration of @xmath1s ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the amplitudes range from @xmath2mag to @xmath3mag in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands , respectively .",
    "the detection of transient variations is based on a search for coincidence between the data of different telescopes operating synchronously .",
    "let us convert the light curve using the cumulative poisson distribution with the mean and current readings @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , @xmath19 which is the probability of obtaining the observational result @xmath18 .",
    "if a coincidence between two telescopes is due to a real burst , we expect the individual probabilities to be very close to one .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the significance level to obtain the observational result @xmath18 in the light curve . to calculate the joint significance for @xmath21 synchronously operating telescopes",
    ", we may write @xmath22 as noted by fisher ( 1970 ) , the statistic @xmath23 follows the @xmath24 distribution with @xmath25 degrees of freedom .",
    "further discussion of the problem can be found in our paper ( zhilyaev et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that the coincidence technique may lead to a substantial gain in detection of small - scale variability .",
    "the flare event at 85 sec is defined by the individual confidence probability of 99.999497 and 99.942578 percent , respectively .",
    "its joint confidence probability , which was defined in equation ( 2 ) , goes up to 99.999994 percent with two telescopes operating synchronously .",
    "the frequency of occurrence of such an event is equal to 0.000275 for a record of 38 minutes and sampling frequency of 2hz .",
    "it means that one should perform on the average 3636 similar tests of 38 min duration each , that is , 96 days in total , to obtain the same result on account of random fluctuations .",
    "thus we argue that the flare event is a real phenomenon .",
    "there is a growing evidence for the existence of intermediate - mass black holes in the mass range @xmath26@xmath27 , especially in dense globular clusters ( miller 2003 ) .",
    "these are undergoing frequent coalescence with stellar - mass black holes as well as normal stars .",
    "stars whose orbits cross the event horizon or the tidal disruption radius of a black hole are destroyed before they complete the orbit ( alexander et al .",
    "the keplerian orbital period for a black hole of mass @xmath28 in a vicinity of the event horizon is @xmath29s .",
    "thus , orbital inspiral into a supermassive black hole in a galactic center may be a strong source of gravitational radiation ( and optical emission as well ) on timescales of 10@xmath30s . in the case of intermediate - mass black holes , this timescale is in the range 1100ms .",
    "we adopt the luminosity of m85 to be @xmath31erg s@xmath16 ( a typical value )",
    ". then the m85 flare event has energy @xmath32erg s@xmath16 in the @xmath0 band .",
    "we may estimate the mass of a compact object to be @xmath33 , if the duration of the m85 flare event is defined by the orbital inspiral into a black hole .",
    "the ngc 7331 flare event has a peak power value @xmath34erg s@xmath16 in the @xmath35 band , close to that of the m85 flare event .",
    "merging of intermediate - mass black holes with small black holes or normal stars in galactic nuclei and globular clusters seems to be the most plausible mechanism for short bursts . as shown by misner et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , during the merger the output in gravitation waves may reach @xmath36@xmath37erg s@xmath16 ; in electromagnetic waves , the luminosity may be many orders of magnitude less .",
