    "we analyze the observational case for molecular outflows , gas infall , and co depletion in this data set .",
    "molecular outflows are high velocity , collimated streams of ambient circumstellar material that has been swept up in the stellar wind from a young protostar .",
    "the driving mechanisms behind these outflows are believed to be highly collimated stellar jets of ionized and neutral atomic material ( bachiller 1996 ) , with opening angles as small as 3 - 5@xmath45 , lengths of 10@xmath46 - 10@xmath47 au , and velocities between 150 - 400 km s@xmath34 ( knigl & pudritz 2000 ; arce et al .",
    "2007 ; andr et al .",
    "circumstellar molecular material is caught up in these jets and winds , either through entrainment along the sides of the jets , or through interface bow shocks in the jet ( klaassen et al .",
    "2006 ; bachiller 1996 ) .",
    "the co gas forms highly collimated streams along the flow axis at high velocities , and less collimated flows ( collimation factors between 3 and 10 ) at low velocities @xmath29 30 km s@xmath34 ( knigl & pudritz 2000 ; andr et al . 2008 ; richer et al .",
    "outflows are most commonly bipolar , although monopolar ( ngc 2264 , lada 1985 ) and multipolar outflows ( mizuno et al .",
    "1990 ; avery et al .",
    "1990 ) have been observed .",
    "many of the multipolar outflows are believed to be part of bipolar outflows from other nearby sources ( bachiller 1996 ; carrasco - gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "all low - mass ysos have outflows as long as they are surrounded by a circumstellar envelope ( bontemps et al .",
    "1996 ) . the youngest class of protostars , class 0 , experience the strongest and most highly collimated bipolar outflows .",
    "as they move onto the next stage , class i , the outflows become less energetic and less collimated ( arce & sargent 2006 ; tobin et al .",
    "2007 ; bontemps et al . 1996 ) . as the protostar evolves further and accretes or dissipates its circumstellar envelope",
    ", it no longer has molecular outflows associated with it .",
    "outflows then can be used as tracers of evolutionary stages .",
    "if a molecular outflow is present , the source is most likely class 0 or i. if there is no molecular outflow but there is depletion ( see below ) , then the source is probably prestellar .    because co is the most abundant isotopologue [ i.e. , x(co)/x(h@xmath48 ) @xmath49 ,",
    "the relatively low column density in outflowing gas is often most easily traced through co emission .",
    "in addition , the physical conditions in molecular outflows are sufficient to excite co j = 2@xmath41 emission given its low excitation energy ( 16.6 k ) and moderate critical density ( n @xmath50 @xmath33 ) .",
    "therefore , we primarily look for signs of molecular outflows in our cores using the co observations . to quantitatively assign an outflow to a co line",
    ", we fit gaussians to the portions of the co emission that were not self - absorbed .",
    "we found gaussians fit in this way better fit the emission line wings than a single gaussian fit to the entire co spectrum .",
    "an example of such a single co gaussian fit is done for source 1 in which we produced an lte model of an optically thick co line ( figure [ fig : source1_spec ] ; bottom panel , dashed line ) with a kinetic temperature of 20 k , a co column density of 3.86 @xmath51 @xmath52 , and a linewidth of 1.5 km s@xmath34 , which matches the linewidth of the optically thin tracer , c@xmath2o .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : source1_spec ] the single component fit has a harder time fitting the emission in the line wings",
    ". therefore , by using a two - component fit , we are producing the most conservative estimate of the outflow properties .",
    "we consider an outflow present if the co emission has an extension of at least 1 km s@xmath34 beyond where the co gaussian fit dips below the rms , and if the integrated intensity in the wing has a signal to noise ratio greater than 5 .",
    "gaussians were also fit to the c@xmath2o at the central v@xmath53 to measure the extent of the line wing in co from the central velocity of the core . in cases where c@xmath2o has multiple components , each component was fit and",
    "the v@xmath53 was taken to be at the center of all the emission .",
    "columns ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) of table [ tab : colden ] denote the full extent of the blue and red outflows , respectively , from the center of the optically thin c@xmath2o to where the line wing emission in co drops below the rms noise , while columns ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) show the signal - to - noise ratio in the wings .",
    "radiative transfer models reveal that cores collapsing to form a star produce distinctive spectral profiles dependent on the optical depth of the emission line and the infall velocity .",
    "models show that in a collapsing core , optically thin lines produce a single gaussian spectrum centered at the natal velocity of the core whereas optically thick lines produce double - peaked spectral line profiles with the blue peak brighter than the red peak . as the infall velocity increases , the degree of asymmetry increases as well , from two equally bright blue and red peaks to a brighter blue than red peak ( leung & brown 1977 ; myers et al .",
    "1996 ) . in principle , therefore , we can use spectral line profiles to trace infall motion .",

    "( 1997 ) quantify the asymmetry of the line profile using an infall parameter : @xmath54 where v@xmath55 is the velocity of the more intense peak in the optically thick line , v@xmath56 is the velocity of the peak of the optically thin line , and @xmath57 is the width ( fwhm ) of the optically thin line .",

    ", 2 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 ) this ratio was greater than unity in the outer annulus due to the subtraction of large scale structure in the scuba maps . in these cases a constant amount of continuum flux was added across the entire core to make the ratio unity at the outer annulus .",
    "a ratio of less than one at the peak in the scuba continuum flux indicates depletion at the core .",
    "all cores show some signs of depletion .    in order to quantify the degree of depletion",
    ", we define the depletion factor as the h@xmath48 column density ratio at the edge divided by the h@xmath48 column density ratio at the center of the core .",
    "a number of authors ( bacmann et al . 2002 ; caselli et al . 1999 ; willacy et al . 1998 ; crapsi et al . 2004 ) have found co depletion factors of 4 - 15 in samples of prestellar cores .",
    "however , because our cores may include ( and do include ) protostellar cores and , because we added continuum flux across the entire core in several cases rather than subtracting co emission ( which means that the depletion we measure is through the entire cloud rather than within only the core ) , we arbitrarily select a lower depletion factor ( i.e. , a depletion factor of @xmath27 2 ) to indicate significant depletion .",
    "the depletion factors for our nine cores are discussed in detail in  4.1 .",
    "hence only source 2 and source 5 appear to have significant depletion , while the rest of the cores have very little .",
    "through comparison of the evidence for outflow , infall , and co depletion , we can attempt to deduce the evolutionary state of each core in our sample .",
    "sources are placed into three broad evolutionary classes : ( a ) inactive , in which the cloud shows no evidence for any star - formation activity , although molecular depletion may or may not occur depending on the age and physical conditions in the core .",
    "( b ) pre - protostellar , in which the cloud shows evidence for infall and depletion but has no outflow activity since a central object has not yet formed .",
    "( c ) protostellar , in which we believe a protostellar object is in the process of forming as indicated by the presence of an outflow . in this case , infall or depletion may be present depending on the age of the protostar .",
    "we would expect the youngest cores to display both , because the core must be collapsing to form the central object and may not have had enough time to heat up and evaporate the ice mantles ( jrgensen et al .",
    "the eldest cores , on the other hand , would not show evidence for either , because cloud collapse onto the mature protostar would have been halted and the gas temperatures will be high enough to evaporate the ice mantles and drive hot core / corino chemistry ( jrgensen et al .",
    "the metric for classifying sources as inactive , pre - protostellar , or protostellar is provided in table [ tab : metric ] .    to test how well co works as a tracer of star - formation activity",
    ", we compare our classification of each core based on the spectra of the co isotopologues to the classification based on a comparison of spitzer ( mips and irac ) and 850 @xmath31 m scuba continuum observations . for the latter classification ,",
    "a core is considered to be protostellar if the irac and mips data exhibit the colors [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] @xmath27 1 and [ 8.0 ] - [ 24 ] @xmath27 4.5 , in which [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 8.0 ] , and [ 24 ] are the magnitudes of the detected spitzer sources at 3.6 , 4.5 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath31 m , respectively . in addition , the cores must have concentrations of c @xmath27 0.6 , and the spitzer mips source must be less than @xmath80 from the nearest scuba core .",

    "table [ tab : class ] shows our classification of the nine cores based upon evidence for outflow , depletion , and infall , versus the designation provided by the spitzer data which identifies the closest ir source to the submillimeter core .",
    "based on molecular line data alone , we classify 6 to 7 of the cores as protostellar ( source 4 having an uncertain classification ) and one or two as being inactive ( due to an uncertain classification for source 6 ) .",
    "three of our designations are clearly at odds with the spitzer results : source 4 we identified as being protostellar due to depletion , strong red outflow , and strong infall , whereas the closest ir source is further than 15@xmath40 from the submillimeter peak .",
    "source 7 we identified as being inactive due to its lack of an outflow , weak infall , and weak depletion ; however , spitzer finds an ir source only 3.8@xmath40 from the submillimeter peak .",
    "in addition , we identified source 1 as being protostellar ; however we are unable to confirm this result with spitzer because the identified object may , in fact , be an evolved , foreground star .",
    "thus , at first glance , it appears that using molecular line observations alone to classify submillimeter cores as protostellar or starless works about 67% ( 6/9 ) of the time .",
    "however , if the outflow identified in source 4 originates from source 3 , then we would classify source 4 as pre - protostellar in agreement with spitzer observations .",
    "this would make molecular line observations correct 78% ( 7/9 ) of the time .",
    "however , care must be taken before making such a naive statement .",
    "first , we are obviously limited by small - number statistics and a larger sample would be needed to test this definitively .",
    "second , almost everywhere we have looked in ophiuchus we have seen evidence for outflows and infall . without extensive mapping",
    "it is impossible to say whether , in a crowded field like that in ophiuchus , the outflows are originating from an embedded yso or from a yso in an adjacent core .",
    "large mapping surveys like the gbs may be able to overcome this confusion and disentangle one outflow from another by mapping the full extent of the outflows and being able to find the originating object .",
    "our co maps were limited in scope ( @xmath81 ) and so were unable to do this .",
    "in addition , the higher - energy co j = @xmath5 transition has a higher critical density and so will trace the warm dense gas in the outflow rather than the lower density surrounding cloud material .",
    "the higher resolution of the gbs observations at 345 ghz ( @xmath6 vs. our @xmath7 ) may also provide a clearer picture of outflow activity in crowded fields .",
    "in addition , because the central v@xmath53 s of the optically thin molecular species used to measure the infall parameter are so similar ( table [ tab : colden ] ) to each other , and to the native v@xmath53 of the ophiuchus cloud , our infall parameter may be measuring global motion of the cloud , rather than collapse of each individual core .",
    "thus , the infall parameter may not be an accurate tracer of star - formation activity .",
    "this is especially true because we are using a `` nonstandard '' infall tracer - the low j transitions of co and its isotopologues .",
    "the low critical density and excitation temperature of of these transitions may mean that we are preferentially tracing the motions of the core surfaces , rather than their interiors , which are better probed by transitions with higher critical densities .",
    "even depletion is not a good measure of protostellar versus starless cores , because some of our largest depletion factors are seen in cores with confirmed ir objects .",
    "therefore , in conclusion , it seems that while co observations alone can be ( and have been ) used fairly successfully to search for star - formation activity in isolated cores , great care must be taken in interpreting these results in crowded fields .",
    "multiple outflows from adjacent ysos , global infall of the cloud , and a lack of correlation between depletion factors and embedded ir objects make it difficult to classify the cores with any degree of certainty . while it is clear that useful information exists in these tracers , more detailed , higher - resolution observations are needed over moderately large spatial scales . however , despite these caveats , it is remarkable that these simple and easily observable molecular lines seem to do a reasonably good job in describing the crude evolutionary state of cores in star - forming regions .",

    "<S> in this paper we analyze nine scuba cores in ophiuchus using the second - lowest rotational transitions of four molecular species ( @xmath0co , @xmath1co , c@xmath2o , and c@xmath3o ) to search for clues to the evolutionary state and star - formation activity within each core . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we look for evidence of outflows , infall , and co depletion . the line wings in the co spectra are used to detect outflows , spectral asymmetries in @xmath1co are used to determine infall characteristics , and a comparison of the dust emission ( from scuba observations ) and gas emission ( from c@xmath2o ) is used to determine the fractional co freeze - out .    through comparison with spitzer observations of protostellar sources in ophiuchus , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the usefulness of co and its isotopologues as the sole indicators of the evolutionary state of each core . </S>",
    "<S> this study is an important pilot project for the jcmt legacy survey of the gould belt ( gbs ) and the galactic plane ( jps ) , which intend to complement the scuba-2 dust continuum observations with harp observations of @xmath0co , @xmath1co , c@xmath2o , and c@xmath3o j = 3@xmath42 in order to determine whether or not the cold dust clumps detected by scuba-2 are protostellar or starless objects .    </S>",
    "<S> our classification of the evolutionary state of the cores ( based on molecular line maps and scuba observations ) is in agreement with the spitzer designation for six or seven of the nine scuba cores . </S>",
    "<S> however , several important caveats must be noted in the interpretation of these results . </S>",
    "<S> first , while these tracers may work well in isolated cores , care must be taken in blindly applying these metrics to crowded regions </S>",
    "<S> . maps of larger areas at higher resolution are required to determine whether the detected outflows originate from the core of interest , or from an adjacent core with an embedded yso . </S>",
    "<S> second , the infall parameter may not be an accurate tracer of star - formation activity because global motions of the cloud may act to emulate what appears to be the collapse of a single core .    </S>",
    "<S> large mapping surveys like the gbs may be able to overcome some of this confusion and disentangle one outflow from another by mapping the full extent of the outflows and allowing us to find the originating object . </S>",
    "<S> as well , the higher - energy co j = @xmath5 transition used by the gbs has a higher critical density and so will trace the warm dense gas in the outflow rather than the lower density surrounding cloud material . </S>",
    "<S> the higher resolution of the gbs observations at 345 ghz ( @xmath6 vs. our @xmath7 ) may also provide a clearer picture of activity in crowded fields . </S>"
