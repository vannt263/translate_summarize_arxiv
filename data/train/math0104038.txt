    "in @xcite brooks and makover constructed riemann surfaces from oriented cubic graphs . for each orientated graph @xmath0 they associate two riemann surfaces , @xmath1 a finite area noncompact surface , and @xmath2 a compact surface .",
    "the surface @xmath1 is an orbifold cover of @xmath3 and therefore shares some of the global geometric properties with the graph @xmath0 .",
    "the compact surface @xmath2 is a conformal compactification of @xmath4 ; brooks and makover proved that almost always the global geometry of @xmath5 is controlled by the geometry of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , according to belyi theorem @xcite the surfaces @xmath5 are precisely the riemann surfaces which can be defined over some number field and form a dense set in the space of all riemann surfaces .",
    "therefore these surfaces , called belyi surfaces , can be used to model a process of picking random riemann surfaces , by picking a random graph with a random orientation .    in their work ,",
    "brooks and makover use the graphs to get information on the global geometry of the surfaces @xmath6 , but they do not have control on the distribution of the surfaces in the teichmller spaces . in this paper",
    "we investigate the topology of belyi surfaces , which is the first step in understanding the distribution of @xmath6 in different teichmller spaces .",
    "our main result ( with @xmath7 denoting the number of vertices in a cubic graph ) is the following theorem :    [ thm : main ] @xmath8    the genera of these surfaces can be calculated by the euler formula where the number of vertices and edges is determined by the size of the graph @xmath9 .",
    "the faces , which correspond to the cusps of @xmath4 can be described in a purely combinatorial way from the oriented graph @xmath10 .",
    "using bollobas model for random regular graphs @xcite @xcite , we estimate the number of faces :    [ thm : face ] there exist constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that , for a large enough @xmath7 :    @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of faces of the oriented graph .    the euler formula then gives our main result",
    ".    we will start in section [ sec.bey ] in a review on the construction of the belyi surfaces from cubic graphs , and we will show how to calculate the genus of the surfaces . in section [ sec.ce ]",
    "we will review the bollobas model and use it to calculate the expected value of the number of faces in belyi surfaces .",
    "note : our main interest is the construction of the belyi surfaces , this is why we work with cubic graphs .",
    "other authors @xcite work on the average value of the genus of a given graph : our result can be easily generalized to @xmath15-regular graphs .",
    "an orientation @xmath16 on a graph @xmath9 is a function which associates to each vertex @xmath17 a cyclic ordering of the edges emanating from @xmath17 .",
    "we build the surface @xmath4 from an oriented graph as follows : we take the ideal hyperbolic triangle @xmath18 with vertices @xmath19 , and @xmath20 shown in figure [ triangle ] .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ triangle ] are geodesics joining the points @xmath21 , and @xmath22 with the point @xmath23 , while the dotted lines are horocycles joining pairs of points from the set @xmath24 .",
    "we may think of these points as `` midpoints '' of the corresponding sides of the ideal triangles , even though the sides are of infinite length .",
    "we may also think of the three solid lines as edges of a graph emanating from a vertex .",
    "we may then give them the cyclic ordering @xmath25 .",
    "given a cubic graph with orientation @xmath10 we build a non - compact riemann surface denoted by @xmath1 , by associating to each vertex an ideal triangle , and gluing neighboring triangles .",
    "we glue two copies of @xmath18 along the corresponding sides , subject to the following two conditions :    a : :    the `` midpoints '' of the two sides are glued together ,    +    and b : :    the gluing preserves the orientation of the two copies of    @xmath18 .    the conditions ( a ) and ( b ) determine the gluing uniquely .",
    "it is easily seen that the surface @xmath1 is a complete riemann surface with a finite area equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath7 is the number of vertices of @xmath9 , and that the horocycles of the copies of @xmath18 fit together to give closed horocycles about the cusps of @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the conformal compactification of @xmath27 . using the results about random cubic graphs brooks and makover proved @xcite :",
    "[ typical ] there exist constants @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 such that , as @xmath30 :    a : :    the first eigenvalue    @xmath31 satisfies    @xmath32 \\to 1.\\ ] ] b : :    the cheeger constant @xmath33    satisfies    @xmath34 \\to 1.\\ ] ] c : :    the shortest geodesic    @xmath35 satisfies    @xmath36 \\to 1.\\ ] ] d : :    the diameter    @xmath37    satisfies    @xmath38 \\to 1.\\ ] ]    the topology of the surface can be read from the oriented graph using left - hand - turn paths .",
    "a _ _ l__eft - hand - turn path on @xmath9 is a closed path on @xmath9 such that , at each vertex , the path turns left in the orientation @xmath16 .    on @xmath39 a left - hand path",
    "describe a closed path around a cusp .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the number of disjoint left - hand paths . for a cubic graph",
    "the number of edges is @xmath42 and the number of faces is @xmath43 .",
    "therefore we can write the euler formula :    @xmath44    to estimate the genus of a random surface we need to estimate the number of faces ( or left - hand paths of the oriented graph ) .",
    "it is important to observe that a left - hand path is not necessarily a simple closed path on the graph .",
    "for example , if we take the 1-skeleton of the cube , with the usual orientation ( figure [ cube ] * a * ) , we have @xmath45 , and all the faces are simple paths of the graph . in figure [ cube ] * b * we changed the orientation of the right upper vertex . with the new orientation now if we change the orientation of the right upper vertex , the three simple faces that were adjacent to the upper right vertex before we changed orientation are now joined to one composite face while the other three faces are unchanged hence @xmath46 .",
    "in section [ sec.ce ] we obtain an upper and lower bound on the number of faces given in theorem [ thm : face ] .",
    "the lower bound is obtained by counting the number of faces that are simple closed paths on the graph .",
    "the upper bound on the number of faces is obtained by first dividing the faces into two groups :    a : :    small faces @xmath47 b : :    large faces @xmath48    the number of large faces is easily bounded : since the total number of edges is @xmath49 and each edge has two sides , we obtain that @xmath50 .    to estimate the number of small faces",
    "we first introduce the notion of root .",
    "[ def : root ] a root in @xmath10 is a simple closed path in @xmath9 , such that the orientation @xmath16 agrees with the root in all but maybe one vertex .",
    "each face contains at least one root :    * proof*:pick a vertex @xmath51 and start walking along a left hand path until the path intersects itself , i.e. , @xmath52 @xmath53 is the first intersection , then the cycle @xmath54 is a root ( in all the vertices @xmath55 @xmath56 the orientation agrees with the cycle ) . + in section [ sec.ce ] we will prove that the expected number of roots of length less than @xmath57 , and therefore the total number of small faces , is bounded by @xmath58 . by adding the number of short and long faces we get that the total number of faces is @xmath59 ; from equation [ e : gen ] we deduce our main result [ thm : main ] .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thm : face ] .",
    "let @xmath60 be the space of @xmath61-regular graphs with @xmath7 vertices .",
    "we shall , following bollobas , represent our graphs as the images of so - called configurations .",
    "let @xmath62 be a fixed set of @xmath63 vertices , where @xmath64 .",
    "a _ configuration _",
    "@xmath65 is a partition of @xmath66 into @xmath67 pairs of vertices called _ edges _ of @xmath65 .",
    "clearly there are @xmath68 configurations .",
    "( we write @xmath69 ) .",
    "let @xmath70 be a set of configurations .",
    "we now define a map @xmath71 as follows . given a configuration @xmath65 let @xmath72 be the graph with vertex set @xmath73 in which @xmath74 is an edge iff @xmath65 has a pair with one end in @xmath75 and the other in @xmath76 .",
    "every @xmath77 is the image of @xmath78 for @xmath79 configurations .",
    "the number of configurations containing a given fixed set of @xmath80 edges is @xmath81        for @xmath84 a _ k - cycle _ of a configuration is a set of @xmath15 edges , say @xmath85 such that for some @xmath15 distinct groups @xmath86 the edge @xmath87 joins @xmath88 to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "a 1-cycle is said to be a _ loop _ and a 2-cycle is a _",
    "coupling_. given a configuration @xmath65 , denote by @xmath91 the number of k - cycles .",
    "if we are to restrict to graphs in @xmath60 to have no loops and no multiple edges , then not every @xmath72 belongs to @xmath60 but only those satisfying @xmath92 ; such graphs are called simple .",
    "( in order to restrict to graphs with @xmath93 we have to multiply all the ensuing estimates by @xmath94 . )          to obtain a lower bound on the number of faces @xmath14 , we count the number of faces that are simple closed paths . for each simple closed path of length",
    "@xmath15 the probability of correct orientation is @xmath99 , consequently we have :                the estimate ( [ e : a8 ] ) and the fact that @xmath109 are monotonic decreasing in @xmath15 , show that if we let @xmath15 range from @xmath110 to @xmath111 where @xmath112 , the remaining terms in ( [ e : a9 ] ) are negligible . with that in mind ,",
    "let @xmath113 be an arbitrary positive number independent of @xmath67 . if @xmath114 , the estimate in ( [ e : a8 ] ) is between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "using @xmath117 we get that the asymptotic estimate for that part of sum in ( [ e : a9 ] ) with @xmath118 is between @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "for the remainder of the sum , @xmath121 , and the sum of @xmath122 is asymptotic to @xmath123 times an integral of @xmath124 .",
    "it follows that for any value of @xmath113 , the contribution of this part of sum is bounded as @xmath125 , and so ( [ e : a9 ] ) is asymptotic to a function of @xmath67 which lies between @xmath119 and @xmath126 . since @xmath113 is arbitrary ,",
    "@xmath127 can be made as close to 1 as desired ; hence we obtain that the sum in ( [ e : a9 ] ) is asymptotic to @xmath119 .",
    "now we turn to estimating the number of faces from above . recall that the number of large faces is bounded from above by @xmath123 , so we need to estimate from above the number of small faces . as their length is less than @xmath123 , so is the length of their roots ; thus the estimate on the number of roots of length less than @xmath123 will suffice .    now given a cycle of length @xmath15",
    ", we can turn it into a root in @xmath128 ways : one simple face and @xmath15 proper roots .",
    "furthermore , the probability of correct orientation is @xmath99 .",
    "so we have the following estimate ( with @xmath109 given in [ e : a7 ] ) :"
