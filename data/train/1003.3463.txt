    "although any of the previous mechanisms could explain the narrow sio lines in the ridge between condensations n , e and s , it seems unlikely for offsets ( -10,70 ) and ( -37,37 ) , where the narrow sio lines do not show a clear association with 8@xmath7@xmath12 m or 24@xmath7@xmath12 m sources ( section@xmath7[narrow ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the extended and narrow sio emission toward g035.39 - 00.33 could be produced by a widespread and lower - mass population of protostars , compared to those powering condensations n , e and s. some of these distributed protostars may be visible as the 8@xmath7@xmath12 m sources in figure@xmath7[f1 ] , although we do see sio emission from regions apparently devoid of such sources . in this scenario , beam dilution would then prevent us from detecting the broad sio line wings expected to arise from these objects .",

    "however , this mechanism seems unlikely in g035.39 - 00.33 , because of the relatively low luminosity of the region ( it is observed as an infrared dark rather than bright cloud ) , and because the uv radiation field required to produce sio fractional abundances similar to those observed in this cloud ( of @xmath810@xmath13 ) , should be at least few hundred times the galactic uv field @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for sources capable of producing such an intense fuv field in this region , and even propagation of the much lower - intensity galactic fuv radiation field into this cloud , would be strongly impeded by its high extinction . nor are cosmic ray induced uv photons @xcite expected to play a key role in the formation of narrow sio since the same uv field is generated in nearby quiescent dark clouds , where no sio is detected .    in summary , we report the detection of widespread ( size of @xmath62@xmath7pc ) sio emission toward a very filamentary irdc .",
