    "the proposal of materials with simultaneous negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability by veselago in 1967 @xcite has opened the door toward the design of novel and remarkable optical devices based on the use of metamaterials or photonic crystals , such as the perfect flat lens @xcite or the invisibility cloak @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown how these negative electromagnetic properties can be revisited through the admittance formalism @xcite , which is widely used in the thin - film community @xcite and defined the computational rules for the effective indices and phase delays associated with wave propagation through negative - index layers @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that we can simulate the optical properties of negative index material ( nim ) layer by replacing it with a positive index material ( pim ) with the same effective index ( @xmath0 ) , provided that we use for this pim layer a * virtual * thickness * opposite * to that of the nim layer ( @xmath1 ) , which is reminiscent of optical space folding in complementary media @xcite .",
    "this computational rule is easily implementable in standard thin - film software and has allowed us to analyze the spectral properties of some standard multilayer stacks , such as the antireflection coating , the quarter - wavelength bragg mirror and the fabry - perot bandpass filter , in which one or more layers of these stacks involve negative index materials @xcite .    among the presented results , the most spectacular concerns the large increase in the spectral bandwidth of a quarter - wavelength bragg mirror induced by the use of a negatively refracting material ( either the high - index layers or the low - index layers ) and the ability to tailor the phase properties of such multilayer structures by adjusting the number and the features of nim layers within the stack .",
    "the objective of this work is to define an optimization method for such improvements and to identify the design of a _ white _ fabry - perot , i.e. a multilayer cavity that spontaneously exhibits * resonant behavior over a very large spectral range*.",
    "let us consider a bragg mirror that contains @xmath2 alternated quarter - wavelength layers as described by the following formula    incident medium / @xmath3 / substrate    the refractive index of the semi - infinite glass substrate is denoted by @xmath4 , whereas that of the semi - infinite incident medium is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the incident medium and the substrate are non - absorbing positive - index materials .",
    "each layer of the stack can be composed of a positive ( high - index @xmath6 , low - index @xmath7 ) or a negative index material ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , each of which should be non - absorbing .",
    "moreover , in this first approach we neglect the dispersion law of refractive indices for all materials under study .",
    "though this assumption may appear too simplistic in the case of negative index materials , recently published results @xcite showed that it was possible to efficiently control this dispersion in a wide spectral range .      to determine the reflection properties of such a stack , we use the following basic formula @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective index of the incident medium , @xmath12 is the complex admittance of the stack , @xmath13 is the amplitude reflection coefficient , @xmath14 is the corresponding reflectance and @xmath15 is the phase change at the reflection .",
    "the effective index of a medium is given by the general relation @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 for a plane wave passing through a multilayer stack that contains @xmath2 layers , @xmath19 is an invariant quantity that is defined by the angle of incidence ( aoi ) @xmath20 in the incident medium @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the layer number , while @xmath17 depends on the layer and is defined , in the propagating mode , by ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 consequently , we can rewrite relation ( [ eq : effectiveindexalpha ] ) in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the vacuum impedance .",
    "relation ( [ eq : effectiveindextheta ] ) is independent of the type of material ( pim or nim ) within the layer because @xmath27 and @xmath28 are simultaneously negative in the case of negative index materials .",
    "the computation of the @xmath12 factor is based on the application of a recursive formula that links the admittances at two consecutive boundaries @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the phase delay introduced by the crossing of the layer @xmath22 .",
    "the initialization of this recursive formula occurs in the substrate where only the outgoing plane wave is present @xmath31 the phase delay @xmath30 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effectivel thickness of the layer @xmath22 and @xmath34 a binary coefficient equal to + 1 ( -1 ) for a layer that consists of a positive index ( negative index ) material .",
    "this last relation justifies the statement in section [ sec : introduction ] and indicating that we can replace each nim with an equivalent pim that is characterized by a virtual negative thickness @xcite .",
    "all of the layers in the bragg mirror stack are quarter - wavelength ; hence , at zero aoi , we can write @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the central wavelength of the mirror .",
    "if we use a linear approximation of this last relation near @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 consequently , the recursive formula ( [ eq : recursiveformula ] ) becomes , at the same level of approximation @xmath38\\ ] ] by initializing this new recursive formula using relation ( [ eq : initialization ] ) , we find @xmath39 with @xmath40^q\\enskip\\text{for } p=2q\\\\ \\frac{\\tilde{n}_h^2}{\\tilde{n}_s}&\\left[\\frac{\\tilde{n}_h^{2}}{\\tilde{n}_l^{2}}\\right]^q\\enskip\\text{for } p=2q+1 \\end{aligned } \\right .",

    "a multilayer fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity is composed of a thin spacer ( with refractive index @xmath45 and thickness @xmath46 ) surrounded by two quarter - wavelength bragg mirrors deposited at the surface of a semi - infinite substrate .",
    "the overall round trip phase @xmath47 of this planar cavity is defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the optical path difference corresponding to the round trip of the light in the spacer layer ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) the phase change at the reflection on the upper mirror ( lower mirror ) .",
    "a fabry - perot resonance is defined by a central wavelength @xmath36 for which the overall round - trip phase @xmath53 is a multiple of @xmath54 and by a spectral bandwidth @xmath55 which is given , at leading order approximation , by @xmath56_{\\lambda_0}|}\\cdot\\frac{1-\\sqrt{r_{\\text{ls}}^+r_{\\text{us}}^-}}{(r_{\\text{ls}}^+r_{\\text{us}}^-)^{\\frac{1}{4}}}\\ ] ] in other words , the spectral bandwidth of such a fp resonance can become extremely large if the linear dependence of the overall round - trip phase in the cavity @xmath57_{\\lambda_0}=-\\frac{4\\pi n_{\\text{sp}}e_{\\text{sp}}}{\\lambda_0 ^ 2}+\\left.\\frac{\\partial\\rho_{\\text{us}}^-}{\\partial\\lambda}\\right|_{\\lambda_0}+\\left.\\frac{\\partial\\rho_{\\text{ls}}^+}{\\partial\\lambda}\\right|_{\\lambda_0 } \\label{eq : philineardependence}\\ ] ] is equal or very close to zero .",
    "to fulfill this condition and thus obtain a resonant behavior over a very large spectral range , it is absolutely required that at least * one of the cavity mirrors includes nim layers * , which is the only way to obtain a * positive * linear dependence of the phase change at reflection @xcite .    to determine the optimal design of such a * _ white _ multilayer fabry - perot cavity * , we systematically investigate the variation of @xmath58_{\\lambda_0}$ ] of all the symmetric multilayer stacks described by the general formula    air / h@xmath59 2l @xmath60h / glass    when the refractive index @xmath6 of the high - index material varies in the range between 2.00 and 3.00 , while the other refractive indices remain constant ( @xmath5 = 1.00 , @xmath4 = 1.52 and @xmath7 = 1.48 ) . in the previous stack formula",
