    "a major fraction of the practical problems in the operation of cyclotrons are related to beam extraction : the activation of extraction elements increases the personal dose during maintenance work and sometimes requires to shutoff the beam long before the scheduled work .",
    "the electrostatic elements are frequently the cause of beam interruptions due to high voltage trips , they require regular maintenance like cleaning and conditioning . in order to increase the extraction efficiency , the energy gain per turn must be maximized , which requires to run cavity and resonators at the limit of what can be achieved .",
    "this in turn increases the frequency of cavity trips and amplifier failures .    in this work ,",
    "we propose to utilize the mechanism of stripping extraction , which is fairly well - established in many machines worldwide in nearly the complete energy and intensity range that can be achieved by cyclotrons  @xcite .",
    "the extraction mechanism that we present here might help to avoid most extraction problems completely . in the case of variable energy extraction as we propose for proton therapy machines , energy degraders and energy selection systems can be omitted , thus reducing the costs and the facility footprint significantly",
    ". since the required beam intensities are typically in the order of @xmath1 at the patient only , it should be possible to keep a cyclotron with variable energy extraction almost free from activation of components .",
    "higher beam currents  of up to @xmath2  are mainly required to compensate the losses of energy degradation and collimation  @xcite .",
    "variable energy extraction by stripping has been proposed and used at the manitoba cyclotron by stripping of @xmath3-ions  @xcite and in the raccam cyclotron  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath3-ion is not stable in strong magnetic fields at high energy , so that @xmath3-cyclotron are either limited in energy or restricted magnetic field values .",
    "this requires large radius machines like the triumf cyclotron  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the use of @xmath3 ions in accelerators is more demanding with respect to the machine vacuum and the production of @xmath3 in ion sources .    cyclotrons ( and/or ffags ) with reverse bends have been proposed in the past  @xcite  mainly in order to achieve the focusing conditions that are required for energies of @xmath4 and above .",
    "however there is no publication known to the authors that proposes the use of reverse bends in combination with stripping extraction .    in",
    "most ( if not all ) cases where stripping extraction of @xmath0-ions is used , the proposed extraction schemes lead to complicated orbits that circle one or even multiple times within the cyclotron before the beam exits  @xcite .",
    "the use of this method for multiple or even for continously variable energy extraction is difficult - if at all possible .",
    "another method to achieve beam extraction at variable energy is the variation of the main field of the cyclotron and to use a sequence of trim coils to achieve isochronism for the desired extraction energy .",
    "this method is the most `` natural '' way and it is known to work .",
    "however the minimal time to switch between energies is given by the ramping of the main field and the magnetic relaxation time of the yoke .",
    "in the optimal case it might be possible to realize energy switching within minutes .",
    "we are aiming for a millisecond range , i.e. energy switching times that are compatable to the time that is required to adjust a beamline with laminated magnets to the new energy .",
    "the goal of this work is to present first basic geometrical and beam dynamical studies in order to investigate the feasibility of variable energy cyclotrons and to explore the energy ranges that could be achieved . concerning the beam dynamics",
    "we restrict ourselves to the minimum , which we consider to be the verification of the stability of motion of a coasting beam and of the extraction mechanism . in order to survey the parameter space for such machines",
    "we restrict ourselves to the so - called hard edge approximation of the magnets .",
    "and we further simplify this approach by assuming homogeneous magnetic fields within sectors and valleys .",

    "[ sec_geom ] , we give a description of the geometry and the calculation of the transfer matrices .",
    "the equations given there have been used in mathematica^^ to analyze the orbits and the traces of the transfer matrices in hard edge approximation in order to find stable solutions with the desired extraction orbits .",
    "base on the results , a `` c''-program was used to generate smoothed magnetic field maps , which have then been analyzed with an equilibrium orbit code  @xcite and a cartesic tracking code to verify the analytical results of the hard edge approximation numerically .    in sections",

    "they might ( but do nt have to ) be used simultaneously in order to deliver beam for four treatment rooms located around the cyclotron bunker .",
    "since a direct beam from the cyclotron has a small emittance and energy spread , the beam transport system does not require magnets with large aperture .",
    "hence beamline and gantry might be smaller and cheaper than those of conventional systems .",
    "if the beam size and energy spread are too small for fast painting of the tumor , one could insert scatterers into the beam path - or one might directly use `` thick '' stripper foils , which increase the beam size by scattering and make the beam shape more gaussian .",

    "it allows for instance to make precise online field measurements by nmr - probes .",
    "the results could be used to stabilize the magnetic field without beam extraction as it is required for a phase probe  @xcite .",
    "this would not only reduce start up time and simplify beam quality management , but it might also reduce activation of an external beam dump .",
    "furthermore the mechanism that places the stripper foil - if fast enough - could be made `` fail - save '' : if a spring retracts the foil off the median plane in case of emergency , extraction immediately stops . without stripper foil but with an appropriate shaping of the edge field with enough phase shift per turn , the cyclotron could operate in a stand - by mode without activation and extraction but with contineous beam in the median plane .",
    "the beam would be accelerated to maximal energy , phase shifted in the fringe field , decelerated back to the cyclotron center and dumped there without activation of components . in this way , the equipment could stay `` warm '' in stand - by mode .",
    "if beam is requested , the only action to be taken is to insert the stripper foil at the desired location for the requested energy .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest in high intensity cyclotrons not only for the potential use in accelerator driven systems ( ads ) for transmutation of nuclear waste or as `` energy amplifier ''  @xcite , but also for physical experiments like @xmath75  @xcite .",

    "in addition to the above transfer matrices , we will use the familiar coordinate rotation matrix @xmath119 : _ rot()= & -&0&0 + & & 0&0 + 0&0&&- + 0&0 & & + . if we consider an accelerator with @xmath5 equal sectors ( or sections ) , then - given an arbitrary starting position @xmath120 - the position and direction change after one sector _",
    "relative to some center point @xmath121 _ can be described by a rotation with an angle of @xmath122 .",
    "hence we may write ( * * ( l)-**_c)=*m*_rot()(**(0)-**_c ) , so that by the use of eqn .",
    "[ eq_solution ] one finds ( * m*_sec**(0)-**_c)&=&*m*_rot()(**(0)-**_c ) + ( * m*_sec-*m*_rot())**(0)&=&(*1 * -*m*_rot())**_c .",
    "the coordinates of the accelerator center can be obtained by : _ c=(*1 * -*m*_rot())^-1(*m*_sec-*m*_rot())**(0 ) .",
    "[ eq_center ] the matrix @xmath123 can be directly computed and is explicitely given by _",
    "x()&=&12*m*_rot(/2-/2 ) + & = & 1&-&0&0 + & 1&0&0 + 0&0&1&- + 0&0&&1 + if one computes the center of motion of a bending magnet for an angle @xmath124 , the result is given by _",

    "the computation of the center coordinates is therefore straightforward - and yields a result even , if the matrix @xmath125 does not describe a `` valid '' sector .",
    "such a non - valid situation is given , if the the `` velocity '' components of @xmath126 do not vanish , which happens , if the sum of the bending angles entering @xmath125 does not equal @xmath124 .    in the following we use eqn .",
    "[ eq_center ] to compute the starting conditions for a cyclotron centered at @xmath127 , i.e. the radius and direction of an _ equilibrium orbit_. if we let the orbit start at @xmath128 in arbitrary direction , i.e. we choose for instance @xmath129 , then the orbit with starting position @xmath130 is centered .",
    "hence the starting position ( 0)=(*1 * -*m*_x()(*m*_sec-*m*_rot()))(0,0,0,1)^t .",
    "[ eq_centerstart ] is centered .",
    "the orbit still starts at an `` arbitrary '' angle @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath120 as given by eqn .",
    "[ eq_centerstart ] can be written as ( 0)=(r , r,0,1)^t=(x_0,y_0,0,1)^t .",
    "if one aims for a specific orientation of the orbit with respect to the floor coordinates - for instance on the x - axis - then one may use the rotation matrix with @xmath132 : ( 0)_rot(-_0)**(0)=(r,0,,)^t . the angular width of the magnet can then be calculated by computing the position angle of @xmath133 .     and",
    "@xmath134 are the spiral angles of the entrance and exit of the magnet . @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the angles between the sector entrance and exit and the orbit normal vector .",
    "it is obvious from the drawing that @xmath137 .",
    "[ fig_secgeom],width=321 ]    if this method is applied to a cyclotron sector composed of a dipole with bending radius @xmath138 and bend angle @xmath139 and a drift of length @xmath109 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_secgeom ] , then one obtains : & = & 2rl+ + r&=&. both conditions could also be derived from fig .",
    "[ fig_secgeom ] .",
    "the advantage of the algebraic method is , that it gives an _ algorithm _ at hand that allows to determine the essential geometric conditions directly from the parameters @xmath138 , @xmath5 and @xmath109 , without the need to analyze a `` hand - made '' drawing .",
    "furthermore the algebraic algorithm enables to produce the drawing .    in case of the simple situation scetched in fig .",
    "[ fig_secgeom ] , the drawing might do as well .",
    "but in the case of the medical cyclotron as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_medcyc ] , the symmetrie of the equilibrium orbit for a given energy is broken by the drift between the reverse bend ( valley ) and the next sector . in this case and in case of more complex configurations , the analysis of the layout by a handmade scetch becomes cumbersome due to the increasing number of angles and geometrical relations .",
    "in fact , the geometry of the medical cyclotron presented above has been analyzed by a `` c''-program and a mathematica^^ notebook based on the above algebraic ansatz .",
    "the main reason was the desire to create a map of the magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates for the numerical ( and hence more `` realistic '' ) computation of the tunes . in case of a cyclotron that is composed of @xmath5 sections each containing a sector magnet , a reverse bend and a drift",
    ", it turns out , that the entrance and exit radius for a given energy are not equal .    for a given radius of the grid",
    ", we had to determine the energy ( i.e. the @xmath140-value ) of the equilibrium orbit entering the sector , a second @xmath140-value for the orbit existing the sector and a third one at the exit of the reverse bend .",
    "this was done by an iterative numerical interval search .",

    "<S> we discuss the principle possibility of stripping extraction in combination with reverse bends in isochronous separate sector cyclotrons ( and/or ffags ) . if one uses reverse bends between the sectors ( instead of drifts ) and places stripper foils at the sector exit edges , the stripped beam has a reduced bending radius and it should be able to leave the cyclotron within the range of the reverse bend - even if the beam is stripped at less than full energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we are especially interested in @xmath0-cyclotrons , which allow to double the charge to mass ratio by stripping . </S>",
    "<S> however the principle could be applied to other ions or ionized molecules as well . for the production of proton beams by stripping extraction of an @xmath0-beam </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss possible designs for three types of machines : first a low - energy cyclotron for the simultaneous production of several beams at multiple energies - for instance 15 mev , 30 mev and 70 mev - thus allowing to have beam on several isotope production targets . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it is desired to have a strong energy dependence of the direction of the extracted beam thus allowing to run multiple target stations simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> second we consider a fast variable energy proton machine for cancer therapy that should allow extraction ( of the complete beam ) at all energies in the range of about 70 mev to about 250 mev into the same beam line . </S>",
    "<S> and third , we consider a high intensity high energy machine , where the main design goals are extraction with low losses , low activation of components and high reliability . </S>",
    "<S> especially if such a machine is considered for an accelerator driven system ( ads ) , this extraction mechanism has severe advantages : beam trips by the failure of electrostatic elements could be avoided and the turn separation could be reduced , thus allowing to operate at lower main cavity voltages . </S>",
    "<S> this would in turn reduce the number of rf - trips .    </S>",
    "<S> the price that has to be paid for these advantages is an increase in size and/or in field strength compared to proton machines with standard extraction at the final energy .    </S>",
