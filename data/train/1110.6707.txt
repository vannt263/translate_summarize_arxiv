    "the hamiltonian , which controls the system evolution , is determined by a corresponding lri , which is constructed according to the desired initial and final states of the system .",
    "the iec of a system is not adiabatic in general , although the associated hamiltonian of the system may happen to satisfy the adiabaticity condition .",
    "chen and his collaborators have shown that it was plausible that iec offered shortcuts to adiabatic control of the pure states of a two - level quantum system without heating the system @xcite .    in this paper , we study iec in more details by applying it to mixed states of a two - level quantum system .",
    "we consider mixed states because they are more general than pure states and play the key role in nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) quantum computation .",

    "non_adiabatic control passages of a two - level system , compared with the viable adiabatic control passages of the system .",
    "moreover , the lower bound of the control time of iec is only constrained physically but not mathematically .",

    "[ fig : usualunusual ] , the population inversion achieved by the antedated control passages ( solid ) appears at the peak and valley of the passages ; hence , as opposed to the case of usual control passages , the evolution of the state must halt sharply at @xmath105 because somewhat off that specific temporal position would reduce the fidelity .",
    "this price certainly depends on how much tolerance in compromising the fidelity is practical .",
    "we remark that although switching between hamiltonians takes some amount of time , turning on or off a rf field in nmr costs negligible time compared with the control time of iec @xcite .    in the next subsection",

    "the legend in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega5thbeta ] presents the result , which shows that the faster the antedated control passage the less the energy cost",
    ". this conclusion may be somewhat rush because we do not know yet if the energy cost of each antedated control passages under investigation is optimized .",
    "it turns out to be the case as we will show below .    .",
    "]    the integrals shown in the legend of fig .",
    "[ fig : omega5thbeta ] suggests the existence of a certain lower bound in the energy cost .",
    "although it turns out to be true , merely decreasing the antedated time @xmath140 can hardly lead to the bound , contrary to a naive expectation .",
    "we point out the reason without demonstration . by our study , as soon as @xmath140 gets less than @xmath143 , the corresponding @xmath41 will not only cross zero at @xmath140 but also be below @xmath144 at a later time , which brings to @xmath20 and @xmath47 extra unphysical behaviors , such as discontinuity in @xmath20 and @xmath47 and divergence in @xmath47 , which can not be simultaneously remedied by any form of @xmath42 .",
    "nevertheless , for any fixed @xmath140 , the energy cost admits a lower bound that is dictated by the value of @xmath118 , as pointed out earlier .",
    "( in units of @xmath145 ) .",

    "( [ eqecost ] ) . ]    to illuminate the relation between @xmath118 and the energy cost of an antedated control passage , we again consider the control passages in fig .",
    "[ fig : population5thbeta ] , for each of which we sweep @xmath118 in a wide range , say @xmath146 $ ] , then study the energy cost of the control passage as a function of @xmath118 . the result",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : energycost ] . seen in this figure",
    ", each curve of energy cost has a minimum at certain value of @xmath118 , as marked by the black dots therein .",
    "note that @xmath147 is different from @xmath118 by only a minus sign , see e.g. , eq .  ( [ condbeta5th4gammamid0 ] )  ( v ) . we collect the minimal energy costs in fig .",
    "[ fig : energycost ] as follows .",
    "@xmath148    according to fig .  [",
    "fig : energycost ] , the order of the energy costs in the legend of fig .",
    "[ fig : omega5thbeta ] is no more than a coincidence that arises for our unintended choice of @xmath149 for those cases . despite this , eq .",
    "( [ eqecost ] ) , which is extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig : energycost ] , verifies that the energy cost of an antedated control passage reduces with the antedated time @xmath140 , as long as the right @xmath118 is imposed to minimize the energy cost of the control passage for a given value of @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , antedated control passages can be optimized by manipulating both @xmath140 and @xmath118 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqecost ] ) also points to the existence of a lower bound @xmath85 of the minimal energy cost of antedated iec .",
    "in other words , an iec is extremely optimized in terms of energy cost when the inversely - engineered rabi frequency @xmath20 happens to be a @xmath85-pulse , as @xmath150 .",
    "nevertheless , one must diminish @xmath140 further , beyond @xmath151 , to achieve this extremal case .",
    "however , this will result in unphysical @xmath47 and @xmath20 before the extreme is hit as explained before",
    ".    now that the energy cost of the antedated control passages of iec can be optimized while the detuning frequency is physical , stability of the fidelity appears to be the only constraint apart from the uncertainty principle and the hamiltonian - switching time .",
    "the last condition depends on how sharply one can terminate the evolution of the system .",
    "given the available experimental power nowadays , there would not be any problem in switching the hamiltonian in the scale of nanoseconds in nmr , for example .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown by taking the two - level system as an example , that iec indeed offers fast control passages  in particular the antedated control passages  as shortcuts to adiabatic control of quantum systems . to design a lri for a system , appropriate boundary conditions on the parameters in the lri",
    "can be imposed to meet various goals of the control . in the scheme that is based on our polynomial ansatz and the family of boundary conditions of @xmath42 and @xmath41 ,",
    "an iec passage is optimal in terms of speed and energy cost when the inversely - engineered rabi frequency obtained from the designed lri is approximately a @xmath85-pulse .",
    "we expect to study the optimization of iec more systematically by means of control theory .",
    "all our results apply to pure states , which are merely a special case of our general analysis .",
    "besides , we note that carlini _",
    "et al_. @xcite studied time - optimal quantum evolution and the optimal hamiltonian for a quantum system via variational principle .",
    "it would be interesting to see if and how their results are related to the optimization of iec .",
    "mixed states are the subject of iec in this paper , it would be intriguing to apply iec to nmr quantum computation , in which mixed states are used for computation , to further shorten the operation time of the one - qubit quantum gates implemented by rf - pulses in nmr .",
    "it is also natural to extend iec to multi - level systems . to this end",
    ", one has to first design reasonable and most convenient lris for these systems , whose forms are rather hard to guess for complicated systems , which is under our investigation and will be reported elsewhere .",
