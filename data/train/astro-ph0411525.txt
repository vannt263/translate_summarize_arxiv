    "the mid- and far - infrared ( mir and fir ) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum probe the population of actively star - forming galaxies obscured by dust .",
    "extragalactic source counts from different surveys over a wide flux range obtained with isocam indicate that these sources have evolved rapidly , significantly faster than deduced from optical surveys ( elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ; gruppioni et al .",
    "these results are supported by the detection of a substantial cosmic infrared background ( cirb , hauser & dwek 2001 ) , which is interpreted as the integrated emission from dust present in galaxies .",
    "the spitzer space telescope is now providing new insights into the ir population contributing to the cirb , in particular with the mips 24-@xmath0 m band , that is starting to detect a population of galaxies that may be ir luminous galaxies at z @xmath1 1.5 - 3 ( i.e. high - redshift analogs of the faint 15-@xmath0 m galaxies detected by isocam ) .",
    "the availability of the new space facilities in the coming years , such as herschel , and on the ground alma , opens new perspective to study in detail the population of ir galaxies beyond z = 1 .",
    "it is now necessary to use models to make predictions for future surveys , in order to better plan the observations with these new facilities . in particular",
    ", we are now using models to answer to the following questions : which galaxy populations will the new instruments detect ? what fraction of the cirb will be detected into sources ?",
    "will we detect any evolution and up to what redshift ? what will limit the future surveys ?",
    "( confusion ?",
    "sensitivity ? )    here we present the predictions for future surveys with herschel obtained with a new model based on the first determination of the 15-@xmath0 m luminosity function , reproducing all the isocam surveys observables and also the recent spitzer 24-@xmath0 m source counts ( see f. pozzi s paper ) .",
    "we use a model fitting the observed 15-@xmath0 m source counts ( pozzi et al . 2004 ; matute et al . in preparation ) to make predictions in the herschel bands .",
    "the model is based on the first determination of the 15-@xmath0 m luminosity function of galaxies and agn , from data of the elais southern fields survey ( lari et al .",

    "four main populations , evolving independently , contribute to the observed source counts : `` starburst '' and `` normal '' galaxies and type 1 and 2 agn .",
    "the `` normal '' population is consistent with no evolution , while the `` starburst '' population requires a strong evolution , both in luminosity and density ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , up to @xmath4 ) .",
    "the results of the model are in remarkable good agreement with all the available 15-@xmath0 m observables , like source counts at all flux density levels ( 0.1  300 mjy ) and redshift distributions and luminosity functions at low and high @xmath5 ( see pozzi et al .",
    "2004 for more details ) .",
    "by using our model and appropriate seds for the different source populations ( arp220 for the `` starburst '' component , m51 for the `` normal '' , the agn1 sed from elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for type 1 , circinus for type 2 agn ) , we have predicted the expected source counts and redshift distributions in the herschel bands covered by the pacs instrument ( 75 , 110 and 170 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "here we report only the results for the 75 and 170-@xmath0 m bands ( see figure [ fig_cnt ] ) . for the `` starburst '' population we have considered different seds ( m82 , ngc6090 and arp220 ) , but we have found that a far - infrared bright galaxy template as arp220 was needed in order to reproduce the firback observed counts ( dole et al .",
    "2001 ) . using such template",
    "sed we find that pacs will reach the confusion limit at 75 and 170 @xmath0 m at 0.73 and 19.7 mjy respectively . at these flux density levels",
    "about all the ir cosmic background will be resolved into discrete sources at 75 @xmath0 m ( cib(@xmath6 mjy ) = 10 nwm@xmath7sr@xmath8 ) and about 58% at 170 @xmath0 m ( cib(@xmath9 mjy ) = 8 nwm@xmath7sr@xmath8 ) .",
    "the number of sources expected at these limits are 21848 per deg@xmath7 and 3488 per deg@xmath7 at 75 and 170 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "the great majority ( @xmath195% ) of these sources will be `` starburst '' galaxies peaking at redshift 1 .",
