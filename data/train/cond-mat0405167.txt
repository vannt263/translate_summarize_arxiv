    "dyson orbitals are a set of one - particle orbitals that are associated with many - electron wavefunctions .",
    "these orbitals connect the exact ground - state of the @xmath0-electron system with excited states containing @xmath1 or @xmath2 electrons .",
    "the importance of dyson orbitals in understanding compton scattering spectra has been emphasized recently by kaplan et _ al . _",
    "@xcite , who present a general formalism for the compton cross section , which goes beyond the standard treatment involving the frameworks of the impulse approximation ( ia ) and the independent particle model ( ipm ) .",
    "the breakdown of the ia in describing core compton profiles is well - known @xcite .",
    "more recently , high resolution valence compton profiles ( cps ) of li at relatively low photon energy of @xmath3 kev have been found to show asymmetries in shape and smearing of the fermi surface ( fs ) features where deviations from the ia have been implicated @xcite .",
    "dyson orbitals also give insight into quasi - particle effects in the correlated ground state of the many body system . in this article , we focus on understanding energies of one - particle excitations of the ground state , which play an important role not only in the formalism of the compton scattering cross - section , but also in the band structure problem more generally . to this end",
    ", a green s function approach is used to first obtain an expression for the exchange - correlation energy in terms of the self - energy operator involved in the description of the dyson orbitals . a local ansatz for the self - energy",
    "is then invoked to obtain a relatively simple expression for the excitation energies .",
    "we illustrate our scheme by considering the example of first ionization energies of low @xmath4 atoms from @xmath5 ( h ) to @xmath6 ( c ) and find good agreement with the corresponding experimental results .",
    "as another example , the measured bandgap in diamond is also reproduced reasonably by our computations .",
    "an outline of this article is as follows .",
    "the introductory remarks are followed in section ii by a brief overview of the general formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite for the compton scattering cross section .",
    "the importance of properly including excitation energies in the computation for describing the asymmetry of the cp around @xmath7 is stressed .",
    "section iii presents the green s function formulation and discusses our scheme for computing excitation energies .",
    "section iv gives a few illustrative applications of the theory , followed in section v by a few concluding remarks .",
    "the dyson spin - orbital @xmath8 can be defined in terms of the many - body ground - state wavefunction @xmath9 and the wavefunction @xmath10 of the singly ionized excited system characterized by the quantum number @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12 where the index @xmath13 denotes both spatial and spin coordinates and the integration over @xmath14 implicitly includes a summation over the spin coordinates .",
    "the dyson orbitals thus give generalized overlap amplitudes between the ground state and the singly ionized states of the many body system .",
    "note that , in general , dyson orbitals do not form an orthonormal set .",
    "the dyson spin - orbital with the spin projection @xmath15 may be written in terms of the spin function @xmath16 as @xmath17 the excitation energy @xmath18 associated with the @xmath19 dyson orbital is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath0-particle ground state energy and @xmath22 is the energy of the @xmath23 particle ionized system when it is in its @xmath19 quantum state .",
    "1 - 3 above define what may be thought of as occupied dyson orbitals . for completeness , one can also introduce a parallel set of `` unoccupied '' dyson orbitals , which connect the ground state to various @xmath24 particle states containing an added electron .    the importance of dyson orbitals in understanding the nature of the compton scattering spectra beyond the framework of the ia and the ipm has been emphasized by kaplan _ et al .",
    "in particular , the triple - differential scattering cross - section for the ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) process , which is the elementary process underlying compton scattering , is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fourier transform of @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the momentum transfered to the final system , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the energies of the photon before and after the collision , and the summation extends over the occupied dyson orbitals .",
    "( [ eqcross ] ) assumes a large energy transfer ( @xmath33 ) , so that the outgoing electron possesses sufficiently high energy that it can be approximated by a free electron plane wave form .",
    "the binding energy @xmath18 in the @xmath34-function in eq .",
    "( [ eqcross ] ) is usually neglected in obtaining the standard ia - based expression for the cross section .",
    "the resulting form of the compton profile after coordinates of the recoil electron are integrated over can be shown to be symmetric around @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , an accurate computation of the binding energies @xmath18 is important for describing the asymmetry of the compton profile related to deviations from the ia .",
    "in order to gain a handle on the nature of the excitation energies @xmath18 , it proves useful to approach the problem through the green s function method .",
    "the orbitals @xmath29 of eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) satisfy the dyson equation @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the external potential , @xmath37 is the hartree potential and @xmath38 is the self - energy .",
    "the green s function can be expressed as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the chemical potential and @xmath34 is an infinitesimal positive number .",
    "the density matrix @xmath41 and the electron density distribution @xmath42 are obtained by integrating the spectral function @xmath43 over the occupied electronic energies @xmath44 where the spectral function @xmath43 is given by @xmath45}.\\ ] ]    the standard calculation of the self - energy @xmath38 and the green s function @xmath46 proceeds via the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) @xcite .",
    "the first order in the mbpt leads to the so - called @xmath47 approximation @xcite ( @xmath46 stands for the green s function and @xmath48 denotes the screened coulomb interaction ) .",
    "the @xmath47 equation for the self - energy is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the 0@xmath51 order green s function .",
    "the calculation of @xmath48 usually requires heavy computations of the dielectric function . here",
    ", we will take a shortcut by describing the screening in terms of the pair - correlation function .",
    "since many - body effects beyond the hartree approximation are contained in the exchange - correlation energy @xmath52 , we can write @xmath53 where the integral is over the occupied states . in the hartree - fock limit ,",
    "the self energy operator is _ instantenous _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath54 . by integrating over @xmath55 , ones finds the well known result for the exchange energy @xmath56",
    "@xcite @xmath57    we now consider the standard expression of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath52 in terms of the exchange - correlation hole @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the coupling constant from the hellmann - feynman theorem , and @xmath60 is a pair - correlation function describing the exchange - correlation hole .",
    "the two expressions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_xca ] ) and ( [ eq_xchole ] ) for @xmath52 can be linked by assuming a _ local _ and _ instantaneous _",
    "ansatz for the self - energy operator @xcite @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the exchange - correlation energy per particle .",
    "eq.([eq_sigma ] ) has an intuitive interpretation . when an electron moves , its exchange - correlation hole moves with it and modifies its effective mass and excitation energy .",
    "insight into the local approximation for @xmath38 is provided by considering the homogeneous electron gas . in this case , one obtains @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a constant due to the translation invariance of the system .",
    "a simple expression for @xmath64 in the metallic density range is given by @xcite @xmath65 where the mean interelectronic spacing @xmath66 is obtained via the electron density @xmath11 by @xmath67 .",
    "thus , as a consequence of the short range of the self - energy , the electron - electron interaction leads only to a uniform shift of the levels in relation to the non - interacting gas . in the hartree - fock case , the density of states unphysically goes to zero at the fermi level as a result of the long range of the self - energy @xcite .",
    "the situation in a real metal is presumably closer to that of the homogeneous electron gas as the screening tends to make the correct @xmath38 local .",
    "indeed , band calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) employing local potentials @xcite have been rather successful in reproducing the experimental fs s in wide classes of materials @xcite .    bearing these considerations in mind , the correction to the excitation energy @xmath18 of eq .",
    "( [ eq_green ] ) may be obtained in the first perturbational order as @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the kohn - sham eigenvalue and @xmath70 is the exchange - correlation potential in the kohn - sham equations .",
    "@xmath71 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq_excite ] ) can be reasonably replaced by the kohn - sham orbitals @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy per particle @xmath72 is computed straightforwardly within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "notably , correction to @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_excite ] ) will in general be state - dependent and therefore this spectrum will be a useful starting point for implementing the scheme proposed by barbiellini and bansil @xcite for treating the momentum density and compton profile of the correlated ground state of the anisotropic electron gas beyond the lam - platzman correction .",
    "fig . [ fig1 ] provides an illustrative example of the usefulness of eq .",
    "( [ eq_excite ] ) .",
    "the first ionization energy of atoms from h to c ( @xmath74 ) is considered using relativistic dft atomic wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy @xmath75 and the potential @xmath76 have been calculated within the lda parametrized by hedin and lundqvist @xcite .",
    "the lda eigenvalues ( open circles ) are seen to be substantially lower than the experimental values ( diamonds ) .",
    "the quasiparticle correction of eq .",
    "( [ eq_excite ] ) brings the theoretical values ( crosses ) in substantial agreement with the experimental values @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of h , although the quasiparticle correction yields a large improvement , the self - interaction error is not fully removed and about @xmath77 % discrepancy between theory and experiment remains .    ) to c ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "diamonds are the experimental values @xcite , open circles give lda values , while crosses give values corrected by using eq .",
    "( [ eq_excite ] ) . ]",
    "we have also applied our scheme to investigate the band gap in diamond . for this purpose ,",
    "the selfconsistent electronic band structure of diamond @xcite was obtained using the local density exchange - correlation functional of hedin and lundqvist @xcite . as expected , the lda band gap of @xmath78 ev so computed is too small . the inclusion of the correction of eq .",
    "( [ eq_excite ] ) yields a gap of @xmath79 ev , which is in far better agreement with the experimental value of @xmath80 ev @xcite . more generally , we expect our correction to reproduce semiconductor bandgaps with an accuracy comparable to that of the computationally more involved @xmath47 approximation @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that in analyzing the generalized density - functional theory ( gdft ) , several authors have pointed out that the energy of electronic excitations across the gap of insulators and semiconductors can be expressed as the sum of the so - called kohn - sham gap and a correction that is usually of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we note that quasi - particle effects directly influence the shape of the fs of a metal .",
    "for instance , the fs of cu can be measured very precisely so that direct comparisons with theoretical predictions are easy to follow . de hass - van alphen ( dhva ) measurements@xcite find the large belly of the fs of cu to be more spherical compared to the lda computations . in v ,",
    "dhva @xcite and positron annihilation @xcite experiments indicate that the fs pockets at the n symmetry point are smaller than those from lda calculations . in @xmath25-ce , an improved agreement with positron annihilation results",
    "is obtained with the lda fs if the @xmath81-band is moved up by @xmath82 mry @xcite .",
    "interestingly , aforementioned discrepancies concerning the fss can be substantially corrected via a simplified computation of the self - energy via the exchange correlation hole @xcite .",
    "we discuss aspects of dyson orbitals for gaining insight into quasi - particle effects in the correlated ground state of a many - particle system .",
    "the importance of dyson orbitals , which connect the many - body ground state with its singly ionized excited states , has been emphasized previously for describing compton scattering profiles beyond the limitations of the ia and the ipm and we start with a brief review of this earlier study @xcite .",
    "we focus on delineating corrections to the kohn - sham energies due to quasi - particle effects and show how one can gain a handle on obtaining substantially improved excitation energies in molecules and solids . for this purpose ,",
    "a green s function approach is used to suggest a relatively simple local form of the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "illustrative applications of our scheme indicate that our self - energy expression should provide a reasonable description of excitation energies in metals and semiconductors with an accuracy roughly comparable to that of the gw method .",
