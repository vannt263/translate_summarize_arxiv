    "it is generally believed that the top quark , because of its large mass , will be a sensitive probe into physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , its couplings to the gauge and higgs bosons may show deviations with respect to the sm predictions . in the sm",
    "the flavour - changing neutral ( fcn ) couplings @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , vanish at tree - level by the gim mechanism , and the @xmath7 and @xmath8 ones are zero as a consequence of the unbroken @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath10 couplings also vanish due to the existence of only one higgs doublet .",
    "these types of vertices can be generated at the one - loop level , but they are very suppressed by the gim mechanism , because the masses of the charge @xmath11 quarks in the loop are small compared to the scale involved . the single top production branching may be estimated roughly by @xmath12 @xcite , and the calculation of the branching ratios for top decays mediated by these fcn operators yields the sm predictions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , gev . ] and smaller values for the up quark . however , in many simple sm extensions these rates can be orders of magnitude larger . for instance , in models with exotic quarks @xmath17 can be of order @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "two higgs doublet models allow for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite , and in @xmath22 parity - violating supersymmetric models one can have @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "top fcn decays into a light higgs boson and an up or charm quark can also have similar or larger rates in models with exotic quarks @xcite , with more than one higgs doublet @xcite or with supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "hence , top fcn couplings offer a good place to search for new physics , which may manifest if these vertices are observed in future colliders .",
    "in addition , the study of fcn couplings provides model - independent information on the charged current couplings and the unitarity of the ckm matrix @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on fcn interactions involving the top , a light charge @xmath26 quark @xmath27 and a neutral gauge boson @xmath28 . at present",
    "the best limits on @xmath5 couplings come from lep 2 , @xmath29 @xcite , and the best limits on @xmath7 couplings from tevatron , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "they are very weak but will improve in the next years , first with tevatron run ii , and later with the next generation of colliders",
    ".    the cern lhc will be a top factory . with a @xmath31 production cross - section of 830 pb , at its 100 fb@xmath32 luminosity phase it will produce @xmath33 top - antitop pairs per year .",
    "in addition , it will produce @xmath34 single tops plus antitops via other processes @xcite .",
    "this makes lhc an excellent machine for the investigation of the top quark properties .",
    "the search for fcn top couplings can be carried out examining two different types of processes . on the one hand",
    ", we can look for rare top decays @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite or @xmath38 @xcite of the tops or antitops produced in the sm process @xmath39 . on the other hand",
    ", one can search for single top production via an anomalous effective vertex : @xmath40 and @xmath41 production @xcite , the production of a top quark without or with a light jet @xcite , and @xmath42 production @xcite . in these cases",
    "the top quark is assumed to decay in the sm dominant mode @xmath43 .",
    "one can also search for like - sign @xmath44 production @xcite and other exotic processes .",
    "the tesla @xmath0 collider with a centre of mass ( cm ) energy of @xmath45 gev has a tree - level @xmath31 production cross - section of 0.52 pb , and produces only @xmath46 top - antitop pairs per year with its expected luminosity of 300 fb@xmath32 .",
    "however , @xmath0 colliders are cleaner than hadron colliders . for instance , the signal to background ratio @xmath47 for rare top decays can be 7 times larger in tesla than in lhc .",
    "but the sensitivity to rare top decays is given in the gaussian statistics limit by the ratio @xmath48 , and the larger lhc cross - sections make difficult for tesla to compete with it in the search for anomalous top couplings .    in this paper we show that the use of beam polarization in tesla substantially enhances its sensitivity to discover or bound top anomalous fcn couplings and allows to improve some of the expected lhc limits up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we first study the single top production process @xmath49 , mediated by @xmath5 or @xmath7 anomalous couplings @xcite",
    ". then we study rare top decays in the processes @xmath50 , with subsequent decay @xmath51 . in all cases we take into account the charge conjugate processes as well : we sum @xmath52 production , and we consider @xmath51 or @xmath53 .",
    "single top production and top decay processes are complementary .",
    "single top production is more sensitive to top anomalous couplings but top decays can help to disentangle the type of anomalous coupling involved ( @xmath5 or @xmath7 ) if a positive signal is discovered .",
    "we consider the planned cm energies of 500 and 800 gev , and for both we analyse the cases : ( _ i _ ) without beam polarization , ( _ ii _ ) with @xmath54 @xmath2 polarization , and ( _ iii _ ) with @xmath54 @xmath2 , @xmath55 @xmath3 polarization . the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] we describe the procedure used to compute the signals and backgrounds and to obtain the limits . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we analyse single top production . in sections  [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ]",
    "we consider top decays @xmath36 and @xmath35 , respectively . in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we summarize the results and draw our conclusions .",
    "in order to describe the fcn couplings among the top , a light quark @xmath27 and a @xmath1 boson or a photon @xmath56 we use the lagrangian @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the chirality - dependent parts are normalized to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "this effective lagrangian contains @xmath62 terms of dimension 4 and @xmath63 terms of dimension 5 .",
    "the couplings are constants corresponding to the first terms in the expansion in momenta .",
    "the @xmath63 terms are the only ones allowed by the unbroken gauge symmetry , @xmath9 . due to their extra momentum factor",
    "they grow with the energy and make large colliders the best places to measure them .",
    "for single top production we study the process @xmath49 mediated by @xmath5 or @xmath7 anomalous couplings ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn1 ] ) .",
    "we will only take one anomalous coupling different from zero at the same time .",
    "however , if a positive signal is discovered , it may be difficult to distinguish only from this process whether the anomalous coupling involves the @xmath1 boson , the photon or both . on the other hand , in principle it could be possible to have a fine - tuned cancellation between @xmath1 and @xmath64 contributions that led to a suppression of this signal .    for top",
    "decays we study the sm process @xmath50 , followed by antitop decay mediated by an anomalous @xmath5 or @xmath7 coupling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn2 ] ) .",
    "this gives the signals @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and the observation of the final state distinguishes @xmath5 and @xmath7 couplings . in the @xmath67 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 signals the top is assumed to decay via @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "for the @xmath65 signal we only consider the @xmath1 boson decays to electrons and muons .       for the @xmath70 signal",
    "we calculate the matrix element @xmath71 . for the @xmath65 and @xmath66 signals",
    "we calculate @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "these matrix elements are evaluated using helas @xcite and introducing a new helas - like subroutine iov2xx to compute the non - renormalizable @xmath63 vertex .",
    "this new routine has been checked by hand . in all cases",
    "we sum the contribution of the charge conjugate processes . for the @xmath74 signals",
    "there is an additional contribution from @xmath70 production plus radiative emission of a @xmath1 boson or a photon .",
    "this correction is suppressed because it does not have the enhancement due to the @xmath75 on - shell , and is even smaller after the kinematical cuts for the signal reconstruction .",
    "the background for the @xmath70 signal is given by @xmath76 production with @xmath77 decay to electrons and muons .",
    "the leading contribution to this process is @xmath78 production with @xmath79 hadronic decay , but it is crucial for the correct evaluation of the background after kinematical cuts to take into account the 7 interfering feynman diagrams for @xmath80 . taking all the interfering diagrams for @xmath81 into account does not make any appreciable change in the cross - section .",
    "the backgrounds for the @xmath65 and @xmath66 signals are analogous , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with 46 and 44 diagrams , respectively .",
    "these three backgrounds are evaluated using madgraph @xcite and modifying the code to include the @xmath77 decay .    to simulate the calorimeter energy resolution",
    "we perform a gaussian smearing of the charged lepton ( @xmath84 ) , photon ( @xmath64 ) and jet ( @xmath85 ) energies using a realistic calorimeter resolution @xcite of @xmath86 where the energies are in gev and the two terms are added in quadrature . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the energy smearing for muons is the same as for electrons .",
    "note that more optimistic resolutions would improve our results .",
    "we then apply detector cuts on transverse momenta @xmath87 and pseudorapidities @xmath88 @xmath89 the cut on pseudorapidity corresponds to a polar angle @xmath90 .",
    "we reject the events in which the jets and/or leptons are not isolated , requiring that the distances in @xmath91 space @xmath92 satisfy @xmath93 .",
    "we do not require specific trigger conditions , and we assume that the presence of high @xmath87 charged leptons will suffice .",
    "after signal and background reconstruction , which will be analysed in detail for each of the processes discussed , we require a @xmath94 tag on the jet associated to the decay of the top quark to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "we require the @xmath94 tagged jet to have @xmath95 ( polar angle @xmath96 ) and energy @xmath97 gev .",
    "we assume a @xmath94 tagging efficiency of @xmath98 , and mistagging rates of @xmath99 for charm and @xmath100 for lighter quarks @xcite .",
    "these are average numbers appropriate for the @xmath101 kinematical distributions we will obtain later .",
    "after kinematical cuts , for each of the cases studied we obtain two types of limits on the anomalous coupling parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "below we outline the procedure used .",
    "the correct statistical treatment of signals and backgrounds is specially necessary in our study since the backgrounds are very small , sometimes much less than one event even for high integrated luminosities .    assuming that no signal is observed after the experiment is done , _ i.e. _ the number of observed events @xmath105 equals the expected background @xmath106 , we derive @xmath107 confidence level ( cl ) upper bounds on the number of events expected @xmath108 .",
    "we use the feldman - cousins construction for the confidence intervals of a poisson variable @xcite evaluated with the pci package @xcite .    on the other hand , we can obtain the smallest value of @xmath108 such that a positive signal is expected to be observed with @xmath109 significance , assuming that the number of observed events for @xmath109 ` evidence ' @xmath110 equals @xmath111 . for a large number of background events , the poisson probability distribution can be approximated by a gaussian of mean @xmath106 and standard deviation @xmath112 .",
    "the requirement of @xmath109 significance is then simply @xmath113 .",
    "however , this is seldom the case for our study , where the backgrounds are very small . in such case",
    ", we use the estimator based on the @xmath114 number ( see for example @xcite ) . the number @xmath115 is defined as the probability of the background to fluctuate and give @xmath116 or more observed events .",
    "@xmath110 is then defined as the smallest value of @xmath116 such that @xmath117 , corresponding to three gaussian standard deviations .",
    "another possible estimator for the evidence of a signal can be built using feldman - cousins intervals . for a fixed value of @xmath106",
    ", we define the number of observed events for @xmath109 evidence @xmath110 as the smallest value of the number of observed events @xmath116 such that the @xmath118 cl feldman - cousins intervals do not contain zero .",
    "these two estimators for the evidence of a signal can be shown to be equivalent , and for @xmath119 both give similar results to the gaussian approximation @xmath113 .    in our analysis",
    "we find that usually @xmath109 evidence limits are numerically larger than @xmath107 upper limits , but this is not always the case .",
    "for very small backgrounds @xmath109 limits are smaller , what means that the potential to discover a new signal is better than the ability to set upper bounds on it if nothing is seen .",
    "this behaviour can exhibit fluctuations resulting from the discreteness of poisson statistics , but in general and comparing with lhc , the tesla discovery potential is better than the potential to set upper limits .",
    "the process @xmath49 gives better limits on the top anomalous couplings than top decays . however , it has the disadvantage that the final state @xmath120 does not distinguish the type of coupling involved .",
    "the background is @xmath121 production with @xmath122 and a jet misidentified as a @xmath94 .",
    "we take only one type of fcn couplings different from zero at the same time , and we evaluate three signals : ( _ i _ ) with @xmath5 @xmath62 , ( _ ii _ ) with @xmath5 @xmath63 , and ( _ iii _ ) with @xmath7 couplings .",
    "their cross - sections depend slightly on the chirality of the anomalous couplings .",
    "the chirality - dependent parts can be written as @xmath123 , with @xmath124 .",
    "for definiteness , we set @xmath125 , @xmath126 in our evaluations .",
    "the results are the same setting @xmath127 and @xmath128 . for a cm energy of 500 gev and the three polarization options discussed the cross - section for @xmath62 couplings",
    "differs @xmath129 setting @xmath130 , and for @xmath63 couplings it differs @xmath131 .",
    "the signals are reconstructed as follows .",
    "the neutrino momentum @xmath132 can be identified with the missing momentum of the event",
    ". the longitudinal missing momentum can also be used , and @xmath132 is reconstructed without any ambiguity .",
    "the @xmath77 momentum is then the sum of the momenta of the charged lepton and the neutrino . in the case of @xmath70 production ,",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath77 and one of the jets , @xmath133 , is consistent with the top mass , and the other jet has an energy @xmath134 around @xmath135 .",
    "of the two possible pairings , we choose the one minimizing @xmath136 and require a @xmath94 tag on the jet associated to the top quark .",
    "the kinematical distributions for @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the signals and the background at a cm energy of 500 gev without beam polarization are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : tc - mt ] and [ fig : tc - ec ] . the @xmath101 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - eb ] .",
    "another interesting variable to distinguish the signals from the background is the two - jet invariant mass @xmath137 .",
    "the @xmath138 background is dominated by @xmath78 production with @xmath139 , and the @xmath137 distribution peaks around @xmath140 , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - mw2 ] .",
    "a veto cut on @xmath137 can eliminate a large fraction of the background but makes compulsory to calculate correctly the cross - section to include all the diagrams for @xmath80 . also of interest",
    "are the total transverse energy @xmath141 and the charged lepton energy @xmath142 in figs .",
    "[ fig : tc - ht ] and [ fig : tc - el ] .",
    "the kinematical distributions with polarized beams are very similar except the @xmath141 distribution . in this case polarization",
    "decreases the peak of the background around @xmath143 .    to enhance the signal significance we perform kinematical cuts on these variables",
    "however , we find that the veto cut on @xmath137 is unnecessary in single top production since the requirement @xmath144 gev and the kinematical cut on @xmath133 practically eliminate the peak in the @xmath137 distribution .",
    "a cut on @xmath134 is unnecessary because this variable is kinematically related to @xmath133 , and we prefer to apply a cut on @xmath133 to show the presence of a top quark in the signal . for simplicity",
    ", we choose to apply the same cuts for the three signals and the three polarization options , but different for cm energies of 500 and 800 gev .",
    "we choose the cuts trying to maintain the independence of the cross - section on the chirality of the coupling .",
    "obviously , our results could be improved modifying the cuts for each type of coupling and each polarization option .",
    "we now discuss the results for 500 gev and 800 gev in turn .",
    "the kinematical cuts for 500 gev are collected in table  [ tab : tc1 ] , and the cross - sections before and after cuts for the three polarization options in table  [ tab : tc2 ] .",
    "we normalize the signals to @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and sum the charge conjugate processes . for the chiralities with @xmath148 the cross - section after cuts differs @xmath149 for @xmath62 couplings and @xmath150 for @xmath63 couplings .",
    "we see that lhc and tesla complement each other in the search for top fcn vertices .",
    "the @xmath62 couplings to the @xmath1 boson can be best measured or bound at lhc , whereas the sensitivity to the @xmath63 ones is better at tesla . for photon vertices , lhc is better for @xmath151 and tesla for @xmath152 .",
    "the complementarity of lhc and tesla also stems from the fact that tesla will not be able to distinguish @xmath5 and @xmath7 couplings in the limit of its sensitivity , whereas lhc will because final states are different and distinguish between them . on the other hand",
    ", the good charm tagging efficiency expected at tesla will be able to distinguish @xmath153 and @xmath154 couplings looking at the flavour of the final state jet , what is more difficult to do at lhc .",
