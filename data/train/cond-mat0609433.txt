    "quasi - one - dimensional electronic and magnetic materials are fascinating objects which have been intensively studied during the last decades .",
    "they show a variety of different phases as the magnetically dimerized , unconventional metal and triplet superconductor phases .",
    "it is possible to go from one phase to another by changing the experimentally accessible macroscopic parameters : pressure , temperature and the applied magnetic field .",
    "the different phases arise from the competition between the coulomb repulsion between electrons and their coupling with the lattice degrees of freedom . whereas the essential physics relies on the one - dimensionality of the electronic dynamics , the stabilization of the different phases depends on the three dimensional character of the system and thus on the interchain interaction .",
    "transitions between the different phases are , in a way , a dimensional crossover from 1d to the three dimensionality of any real material .",
    "spin - peierls systems are probably the simplest example of quasi - one - dimensional materials .",
    "they show a high temperature phase which can be well modelled by a one dimensional antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain and a low temperature phase with lattice dimerization and spin singlet ground state .",
    "the transition between them arises from the competition between the gain in antiferromagnetic energy and the loss in elastic energy .",
    "it is indeed possible due to the three dimensional character of the phonon field .",
    "it is therefore very attractive to carefully understand the precise character of this transition as a representative of a large class of quasi - one - dimensional materials .",
    "the theory of spin - peierls ( sp ) transition was developed in the 1970 s in connection with organic quasi - one - dimensional materials .",
    "the seminal work of cross and fisher@xcite ( cf ) is nowadays taken as the canonical theory of the spin - peierls transitions .",
    "it is based on a rpa approximation for the phonon field , which corresponds to neglecting the dynamics of the phonons .",
    "otherwise the low energy spin correlations are exactly taken into account by the bosonization method .",
    "the cf theory is expected to work when the phonon frequency is much smaller than the spin gap .",
    "moreover , cf have shown that corrections to rpa are small if the bare phonon frequency in the direction of the magnetic chain is much smaller than the phonon frequency perpendicular to the chains , that is to say if there is a _ preexisting soft mode _ before coupling phonons with the magnetism .    in this context",
    "the discovery of the first inorganic sp compound cugeo@xmath0 opened the possibility to experimentally study the dimerized phase and the phase transition with unprecedented precision @xcite .",
    "the recent characterization of a new family of spin - peierls materials with an incommensurate intermediate phase has renewed the interest on a precise description of the phase transition@xcite .",
    "the picture that emerges from neutron scattering measurement of the phonon spectra in cugeo@xmath0 is the following@xcite : at room temperature , there are two phonon modes relevant for the sp transition with @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the ( 0.5 0 0.5 ) point of the brillouin zone .",
    "the phonon dispersion transverse to the propagation vectors of these relevant phonons is rather flat@xcite .",
    "therefore , _ no preexisting soft _ mode is observed and the rpa is not a priori justified .",
    "moreover , on lowering the temperature , @xmath3 and @xmath4 do not soften at the sp transition , as expected in the cf scenario .",
    "this is a strange behavior for a displacive structural phase transition .    on the other hand , gros and werner@xcite ( gw )",
    "have identified a parameter regime where the cf approach does not predict a softening of the relevant phonons but instead the appearance of a central peak in the dynamical structure factor at the transition point .",
    "the temperature dependence of the peierls active phonon modes predicted by this analysis are in agreement with neutron scattering determinations in cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "however the applicability of the adiabatic approximation or rpa in this material is not a priori justified .",
    "in fact , what is missing for a complete understanding of the spin - peierls transition in cugeo@xmath0 , and possibly in other inorganic quasi - one - dimensional materials , is a theory which does not rely on the static approximation for the phonons .",
    "a first step in this direction was presented in [ ] , where the dynamics of the transverse phonons in the antiadiadatic limit was taken into account and the relevance the three dimensional character of the phonons was first brought to light .",
    "we give some more elements of such a theory in the present work .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we start from a one - dimensional magnetic model coupled to two dimensional phonons and integrate out the phonon coordinates . then we treat the effective in - chain interaction exactly by bosonization , and the inter - chain interaction by a mean field approximation . in section iii",
    "exact results for the 1d sine - gordon model@xcite are used to solve the mean field equations . by comparing with the adiabatic approximation we identify the relevant parameter to analyze the deviations from the adiabatic limit , namely the ratio between the frequency of phonon relevant for the sp transition ( @xmath5 ) and the frequency of the phonons transverse to the magnetic chain ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the adiabatic limit is obtained only for high enough value of @xmath7 . reducing this parameter both the gap and the spin - peierls temperature",
    "are reduced . for @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _   the pure one dimensional problem , the gap and the sp temperature vanish .",
    "we discuss our results in connection with a recent study of the af chain coupled to one - dimensional phonons@xcite . in section",
    "iv we study the dynamics of the sp relevant phonon mode in the high temperature phase , using a rpa on the effective interchain coupling generated by the spin - phonon interaction .",
    "we then address the question of absence of softening close to the sp transition .",
    "finally , in section v we present our conclusions and prospects for future related work .",
    "let us start by considering a two dimensional system of spin @xmath9 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains , with exchange constant @xmath10 along one of the axes of a non - deformed square elastic lattice .",

    "moreover , the experimental value observed in cugeo@xmath0 is close to the bcs - ratio @xmath127 .",

    "the precise value of this ratio is difficult to obtain because it is affected by logarithmic corrections induced by marginally irrelevant terms . indeed",
    ", the effect of the marginal term arising from the heisenberg interaction is expected to be small in cugeo@xmath0 because the second next - nearest neighbor is closer to the critical value@xcite , where logarithmic corrections vanish .",
    "however , as can be seem from action ( [ seff ] ) , logarithmic corrections are also expected from the spin - phonon interaction term and they do depend on the phonon frequencies . therefore we expect that the exact value of @xmath128 will ultimately depend on @xmath112 .",
    "the original work of cf on spin - peierls systems predicts the softening of a phonon mode above the transition temperature , whose polarization pattern corresponds to the static distortion leading to the low temperature phase below the transition point @xmath129 .",
    "the softening is due to the coupling of the phonons with the one - dimensional magnetism .",
    "this is in fact a quite general scenario for a structural displacive phase transition .",
    "therefore it came as a surprise that the sp transition in cugeo@xmath0 shows no phonon softening@xcite .",
    "gros and werner@xcite have reanalyzed the cf approach showing that , for higher enough bare phonon frequency , there is a second pole of the phonon propagator without softening of the active sp phonon , characterized by the presence of a central peak in the dynamical structure factor near the transition point .",
