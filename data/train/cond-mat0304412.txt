    "it is now well established both theoretically @xcite and experimentally@xcite,@xcite that the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) ground state near half filling in the higher landau levels ( @xmath0 ) is the quantum hall stripe state .",
    "transport experiments have shown that this stripe state has an highly anisotropic longitudinal conductivity i.e. @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the direction perpendicular to the stripes ) and a hall conductivity @xmath6 that is not quantized .",
    "away from half filling , more precisely at _ partial _ filling factors around @xmath7 and @xmath8 in landau level @xmath9 , the isotropy of the longitudinal conductivity is restored and a minima appears in the diagonal resistance .",
    "concomitantly , the hall conductivity is quantized , but at a value equal to that of the nearest integer quantum hall effect plateaus .",
    "these other ground states around @xmath7 and @xmath10 in @xmath9 have been called reentrant integer quantum hall states ( riqhs ) @xcite .",
    "studies by koulakov , fogler , and shklovskii and moessner and chalker stripesdebut suggest that the riqhs are due to the formation of bubble states .",
    "these states can be described as triangular wigner crystals of electron clusters .",
    "each cluster ( or `` bubble '' ) contains a fixed number @xmath11 of electrons such that , within them , the local filling factor is equal to one .",
    "the bubble states , being pinned by disorder , should be insulating in contrast to the stripe states .",
    "a review of these novel ground states in higher landau level is given in ref . .",
    "the ground state of the 2deg changes discontinuously as the partial filling factor @xmath1 is changed . in the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) , the ground state is a wigner crystal at small filling @xmath1 or , equivalently , a bubble state with one guiding center per bubble . as the partial filling",
    "is increased , bubble states with increasing number @xmath11 of electrons per bubble are stabilized so that the 2deg evolves from the wigner crystal , through a succession of bubble states , into finally the stripe state near half filling . in landau level @xmath12 , it can be shown that ( in the hfa ) the last bubble state has @xmath13 .",
    "the optimal number of guiding centers in a bubble is well approximated by the formula @xmath14 corresponding to an average separation between the bubbles equal to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cyclotron radius and @xmath17 is the magnetic length .",
    "this sequence of phase transitions in higher landau levels has been verified by a number of authors . by comparing the energy of the laughlin liquid at @xmath18 and @xmath19 with that of the bubble states in several landau levels , fogler and koulakov@xcite showed , within the hfa , that the bubble states are lower in energy than the laughlin liquid at filling factor @xmath18 for @xmath20 and at filling factor @xmath19 for @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite used exact diagonalization studies on finite size systems to show the absence of fractional quantum hall states ( fhqs ) in higher landau levels and a tendancy to charge density wave ( cdw ) ordering .",
    "recent calculations by yoshioka and shibatayoshioka using the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) basically confirms the hartree - fock scenario with some minor corrections . for @xmath9 and @xmath22 ,",
    "the dmrg gives a wider region of stability for the stripe phase than in the hfa . as a result ,",
    "the last bubble state ( that with @xmath23 ) is absent from the phase diagram .",
    "the transitions between different bubble states occur at slightly different filling factors in the two approaches . both calculations",
    ", however , give first order phase transitions between the bubble states and between the bubble and stripe states .",
    "the possibility of a continuous phase transition involving the deformation of the bubbles from a isotropic shape to a more elliptical shape as the stripe state is approached was investigated ( with a negative result ) by ren et al .",
    "@xcite within the hfa .",
    "these authors also claimed@xcite that the @xmath24 composite fermion state has lower energy than the corresponding bubble state in @xmath9 and that this liquid state could be an intermediate state between the wigner crystal and the @xmath25 bubble state .",
    "( see , however , ref . . ) in any case , the difference in the cohesive energy of the various possible ground states at any given filling factor is usually quite small and the possibility that quantum fluctuations , disorder , finite extension of the wave function in the third dimension , screening corrections , _",
    "etc_. modify the above scenario can not be ruled out .",
    "the existence of the bubble state near filling factors @xmath26 and @xmath10 in @xmath9 , was first evidenced by transport measurements showing its insulating behavior@xcite,@xcite and its nonlinear @xmath27 properties@xcite . in more recent experiments , lewis and al.@xcite and ye",
    "et al.@xcite measured the diagonal conductivity @xmath28 of the 2deg in the microwave regime and found sharp resonances in @xmath29 $ ] at some frequency .",
    "these resonances are strongest near @xmath7 and @xmath30 in level @xmath31 they appear for a range of partial filling factors around @xmath7 and @xmath8 and only for temperatures below @xmath32 k. it is believed that these resonances are due to the excitation of the pinning mode of the bubble states realized at these filling factors .",
    "the experiments show no hint of discontinuous transitions among the different bubble states .",
    "it is possible that thermal or disorder effects may smear out any sharp effects on the pinning mode .    in light of these microwave experiments ,",
    "it is natural to ask how one could observe a transition between bubble states , and also how one could distinguish between bubble states of different @xmath11 numbers . in this paper , we study how the behavior of several measurable physical properties of the bubble states evolve as the filling factor , @xmath1 , is increased from the wigner crystal state at low filling to the stripe state at half filling .",
    "we show that the series of transitions between bubble states lead to oscillations and discontinuity in the orbital magnetization and susceptibility and to features in the one - particle density of states that are directly related to the number of electrons per bubble .",
    "working in the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation ( tdhfa ) , we also compute the dispersion relation of the phonon as well as those of other higher - energy modes that correspond to excitations localized on the bubbles .",
    "these localized excitations are interesting because ( in contrast to the phonon mode ) they are gapped and probably less sensitive to the disordering potential .",
    "their dispersion can be computed , in a first approximation , by neglecting disorder which is difficult to take into account in these charge density wave states .",
    "we thus apply the tdhfa to show that , within the range of frequencies accessible in microwave experiments , the first order transitions between the bubble states can be tracked by looking at the discontinuous behavior of the first few high - energy modes as a function of partial filling factor .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the hartree - fock procedure to compute the order parameters of the charge density wave states as well as the orbital magnetization and the one - particle density of states .",

    "we did not study this case further , however , since our approximations do not include correlations responsible for the correlated liquid states that are present in @xmath197@xcite .",
    "another indication of the limitations of the hfa and tdhfa is that the last bubble state ( @xmath13 ) is stable , in contrast with the dmrg resultyoshioka .",
    "the dmrg method includes correlations neglected in the hfa and is , in principle , more exact than the hfa . in any case , for values of @xmath199 where a bubble state is stable , we expect the tdhfa to give a reasonable approximation of the dispersion of its collective excitations .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "4 that , above the phonon mode and in the region where the @xmath177bubble state is stable , there is a series of higher - energy modes that are almost dispersionless except near filling factors where the transitions between bubble states do occur . as we explained in ref . , more and more of these modes appear in the response function when we increase the size of the matrix @xmath200 in the equation of motion ( eq .",
    "( [ 7p1 ] ) ) for the response function @xmath201 . as",
    "more modes appear , the previous ones are not shifted in energy so that these modes are not numerical artifacts associated with the truncation of the infinite dimensional matrix @xmath202 . for higher values of @xmath11 , a general trend of the dispersion ( except close to transition points )",
    "is that there are @xmath11 low - energy dispersive modes close in energy and a number of higher - energy much less dispersive modes . for large values of @xmath11",
    ", each bubble has a complex pattern of density modulations and a large number of reciprocal lattice vectors are needed to describe its structure adequately .",
    "it follows that our numerical procedure is less precise in this case as can be seen from fig .",
    "the small dispersion of the higher - energy modes suggests that they can be identified as local oscillations of the density within a bubble .",
    "this is indeed what can be seen from an animation of these modes using eq .",
    "6 show several snapshots of these modes representing the motion of the density in the second , third , and fourth modes for @xmath149 in landau level @xmath9 . from these figures",
    ", we see that the higher - energy modes are density waves propagating along the rings of the bubbles .",
    "these modes can be readily identified by the number of wavelengths of these waves enclosed in the perimeter of the rings .",
    "for example , the second mode corresponds to the case where the perimeter of the rings enclosed two wavelengths , the third mode to the case where the perimeter enclosed three wavelengths and so on .",
    "when the separation between the bubbles decreases in a given @xmath11 bubble state , the density waves on each bubble become more and more coupled and the dispersion of the higher - energy modes can be very pronounced .",

    "( see fig6.png file),width=311 ]    the frequency of the higher - energy collective modes change discontinuously with the transition between the bubble states .",
    "a measurement of the frequency of these modes could then provide yet another signature of the bubble states",
    ". it would be interesting if variations in the gap @xmath203of these higher - energy modes could be detected experimentally .",
    "recently , lewis et al.@xcite reported the observation of an absorption peak in a measurement of the microwave absorption of a ultrahigh mobility two - dimensional electron system in landau levels @xmath9 and @xmath22 .",
    "a peak of absorption occurs at a frequency that decreases as the center ( @xmath204 ) of the landau level is approached from either above or below .",
    "the resonances in the absorption are sharpest for filling factors @xmath1 around @xmath205 and @xmath206 corresponding to the values where the riqhe occur in transport experiments@xcite . at these filling factors ,",
    "the resonance frequency is approximately @xmath207mhz .",
    "it is natural to associate this resonance with a pinned phonon mode of the bubble states ( of either electrons or holes for @xmath208or @xmath209 ) .",

    ". 7 shows , the transitions between bubble states lead to abrupt changes in the gap frequency when the filling factor is varied .",
    "the discontinuities are more pronounced for lower landau level indices @xmath12 .",
    "the frequency range of the first higher - energy mode is in a range of frequencies that can be obtained in a microwave absorption experiment ; thus , such experiments can in principle proble the transitions among bubble states .",
    "we remark that other effects not included in our calculation , particularly the modeling of a finite width for the electronic wave function in the quantum well , could lead to a reduction of the gap frequency .",
    "this would make behavior such as that seen in fig .",
    "7 easier to detect .    to complete our calculation",
    ", it would be necessary to find out whether these higher - energy collective excitations are really detectable by a measurement of the absorption power .",
    "for this , one needs to compute the longitudinal conductivity @xmath28 in the presence of the disorder potential since otherwise ( by kohn s theorem ) only the cyclotron mode will show up in @xmath220 .",
    "this calculation is beyond the scope of this paper but is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in this work , we have studied several physical properties of the bubble states that form in higher landau levels .",
    "we have computed the energy and density pattern of the 2deg ground state , in landau levels @xmath221and @xmath222 , when the filling factor of the partially filled level is gradually increased from @xmath223 to @xmath204 . in the hartree - fock approximation , the wigner crystal at small @xmath1evolves into the modulated stripe state near @xmath204 by passing through a succession of bubble states with increasing number of guiding centers per bubble . in all cases ( @xmath0 )",
    "that we have studied , the transitions are first order .    we have shown that several physical quantities such as the single - particle density of states , the magnetization , the magnetic susceptibility and the dispersion of the collective excitations change discontinuously at the transition between these different ground states .",
    "we believe that these abrupt changes can be detected experimentally .",
    "in particular , we noticed that the density of states structure in the bubble states has features that allow one to determine , at least in principle , the number of guiding centers per bubble .",
    "we have studied more closely the collective excitations of the bubble states and , in particular , the structure of the higher - energy modes ( i.e. those modes above the phonon mode ) . in light of the recent microwave experiments by lewis et al.@xcite",
    ", we think that some of these modes are likely to be accessible experimentally . more work is needed to compute the real weight of these modes in the absorption .",
    "if these higher - energy modes can be detected in microwave absorption experiments , they will show a discontinuous change of the frequency @xmath224 at each transition between the bubble states .",
