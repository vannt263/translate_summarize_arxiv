    "<S> the angular distribution in photon - jet production in @xmath0 is studied within a generalized factorization scheme taking into account the transverse momentum of the partons in the initial hadrons . within this scheme </S>",
    "<S> an anomalously large @xmath1 asymmetry observed in the drell - yan process could be attributed to the t - odd , spin and transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the same function is expected to produce a @xmath1 asymmetry in the photon - jet production cross section . </S>",
    "<S> this particular azimuthal asymmetry is estimated to be smaller than the drell - yan asymmetry but still of considerable size for tevatron kinematics , offering a new possibility to study t - odd effects at the tevatron .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qg ]    in this contribution to dis 2008  @xcite we consider the process : @xmath3 where the four - momenta of the particles are given within brackets , and the photon - jet pair in the final state is almost back - to - back in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the incoming hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order in pqcd the reaction is described in terms of the partonic two - to - two subprocesses @xmath4 and @xmath5 . following reference  @xcite , we will instead of collinear factorization consider a generalized factorization scheme taking into account partonic transverse momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we make a lightcone decomposition of the hadronic momenta in terms of two light - like sudakov vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , satisfying @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath10 in general @xmath6 and @xmath7 will define the lightcone components of every vector @xmath11 as @xmath12 , while perpendicular vectors @xmath13 will always refer to the components of @xmath11 orthogonal to both incoming hadronic momenta , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the partonic momenta ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) can be expressed in terms of the lightcone momentum fractions ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and the intrinsic transverse momenta ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , as follows @xmath22 we denote with @xmath23 the total energy squared in the hadronic center - of - mass ( c.m . ) </S>",
    "<S> frame , @xmath24 , and with @xmath25 the pseudo - rapidities of the outgoing particles , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the polar angles of the outgoing particles in the same frame . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we introduce the partonic mandelstam variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which satisfy the relations @xmath31    along the lines of  @xcite , we assume that at sufficiently high energies the hadronic cross section factorizes in a soft parton correlator for each observed hadron and a hard part : @xmath32 where the sum runs over all the incoming and outgoing partons taking part in the subprocesses @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the convolutions @xmath35 indicate the appropriate traces over dirac indices and @xmath36 is the hard partonic squared amplitude , obtained from the cut diagrams in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qq ] and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the parton correlators @xmath37 describe the hadron @xmath38 parton transitions and their parameterization in terms of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution functions can be found , for instance , in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in events in which the photon and the jet are approximately back - to - back in the transverse plane , therefore we define the vector @xmath39 and require that @xmath40 and using the approximation @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the azimuthal angles , in the hadronic center - of - mass frame , of the outgoing photon and of the vector @xmath45 respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the azimuthal asymmetry is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 contains the dependence on the time - reversal ( t ) odd distribution function @xmath48 and is identical to the azimuthal asymmetry expression that appears in the drell - yan process  @xcite , with the scale @xmath49 equal to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath51 is interpreted as the quark transverse spin distribution in an unpolarized hadron  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of gauge links in the calculation of @xmath47 is discussed in detail in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath52 only depends on the t - even unpolarized distribution functions @xmath53 , which integrated over @xmath54 give the familiar lightcone momentum distributions @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit expressions of @xmath47 and @xmath52 are given in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the process @xmath56 is currently being analyzed by the d  collaboration at the tevatron collider . </S>",
    "<S> data on the cross section , differential in @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , have been taken at @xmath60 tev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such angular integrated measurements are only sensitive to the transverse momentum integrated parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> a study of the angular dependent cross section in ( [ eq : csfinal ] ) will provide valuable information on the tmd distribution function @xmath61 , if the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath62 turns out to be sufficiently sizeable in the available kinematic region . </S>",
    "<S> model calculations  @xcite applied to the @xmath63 drell - yan process have shown that the quantity @xmath47 in ( [ eq : asymmetry ] ) is of the order of 30% or higher for @xmath64 of a few gev and @xmath49 values of @xmath65 gev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a study of the order of magnitude of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath67 requires an estimate of the ratio @xmath52 in ( [ eq : asymmetry ] ) . this will be obtained as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the unknown tmd distribution functions appearing in the definition of @xmath52 are evaluated assuming a factorization of their transverse momentum dependence , that is @xmath68 , with @xmath55 being the usual unpolarized parton distributions and @xmath69 being a generic function , taken to be the same for all partons and often chosen to be gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath67-dependence of @xmath52 then drops out and we get @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of colors and @xmath72 here we have used that the antiquark contribution in the antiproton equals the quark contribution inside a proton . </S>",
    "<S> we consider only light quarks , _ i.e. _ the sum in ( [ eq : ratio2 ] ) runs over @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath23 , @xmath77 , and we use the leading order grv98 set  @xcite for the parton distributions , at the scale @xmath78 .    our results for @xmath52 as a function of @xmath79 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratio ] at some fixed values of the variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath80 , typical of the tevatron experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 considered correspond to their average when both the photon and the jet are in the central rapidity region , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 , where @xmath52 turns out to be largest . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , @xmath52 increases as @xmath18 and @xmath19 increase , due to the small contribution , in the denominator , of the gluon distributions @xmath84 in the valence region .    </S>",
    "<S> hence , we see that the asymmetry @xmath66 is a product of a large drell - yan asymmetry term @xmath47 and a factor @xmath52 that is estimated to be in the 10%-50% range for tevatron kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that an asymmetry @xmath66 in the order of 5%-15% is possible in the central region . </S>",
    "<S> this could allow a study of the distribution function @xmath85 in @xmath86 at the tevatron , offering a new possibility of measuring t - odd effects using a high energy collider . </S>"
