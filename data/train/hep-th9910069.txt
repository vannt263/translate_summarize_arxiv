    "since their introduction @xcite , topological field theories have been object of continuous and renewed investigations and have led to many interesting applications @xcite . their original motivation was to provide a natural framework for a field theory characterization and computation of several topological invariants .",
    "for instance , the chern - simons and the bf theories in three dimensions play a relevant role in knots theory , their correlation functions being respectively related to the jones @xcite and the alexander - conway @xcite polynomials . in particular , a generalization of this framework to higher dimensions allows to describe the linking number of surfaces in terms of antisymmetric tensor fields , whose action reads @xcite @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are forms of degree @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "indeed , it is possible to show @xcite that the correlation function    @xmath6    gives the linking number between two smooth , closed nonintersecting surfaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth underlining also that , more recently , much attention has been given to the fact that topological terms of the kind of ( [ s - top ] ) appear frequently as parts of more general effective actions describing the low - energy dynamics of several field theory models .",
    "for instance , the effective action corresponding to the bosonization @xcite of relativistic three - dimensional massive fermionic systems at @xmath9 can be written as the sum of a chern - simons term @xmath10 and of an infinite series of higher order terms in the curvature @xmath11 and its derivatives .",
    "the same procedure can be applied when fermions are coupled to a dynamical vector field @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the resulting bosonized action contains a mixed term of the type of ( [ s - top ] ) .",
    "these effective actions are well suited to describe several three - dimensional phenomena such as the fermi - bose transmutation @xcite , the quantum hall effect @xcite , the incompressible chiral liquids @xcite .",
    "further interesting examples are provided by the low energy effective supergravities studied in the context of the @xmath12 correspondence @xcite .",
    "indeed , as discussed by @xcite , the dual supergravity action which describes the @xmath13sym theory with electric and magnetic fluxes is    @xmath14    where  @xmath15are the ramond - ramond and neveu - schwarz  neveu - schwarz two forms , transforming as a doublet under the @xmath16 s - duality symmetry , @xmath17 is a negatively curved five - dimensional einstein manifold , and @xmath18 collects all the higher order terms in the curvatures @xmath19 .    in all these models ,",
    "the topological terms appear together with higher derivatives terms in the generalized curvatures , which depend on the metric .",
    "therefore we are naturally led to analyse the possible contributions coming from these terms , as recently done for the three - dimensional abelian chern - simons theory @xcite . in this case",
    "it has been possible to prove that the correlator    @xmath20    describing the linking number between two smooth closed nonintersecting curves @xmath21 , is not affected by the presence of higher derivative interaction terms of the type @xmath22 .",
    "the aim of the present work is that of generalizing this result to higher dimensions . in particular we shall see that , in analogy with the three - dimensional chern - simons , the correlator    @xmath23    is not affected by the introduction of local perturbation terms in the curvatures of the type @xmath24    and gives as final result the linking number of the two surfaces @xmath25",
    "this result means that the correlator ( [ 1 ] ) is stable against the introduction of perturbing local terms in the curvatures , regardless of their power - counting nonrenormalizability .",
    "it is worth underlining that we will limit here ourselves only to effective actions which are abelian , and we shall consider only terms dependent on the curvatures @xmath26 which can be treated as true perturbations .",
    "namely , we shall avoid in the effective action @xmath27 the inclusion of a term of the maxwell type @xmath28    where @xmath29 @xmath30 are mass parameters .",
    "the presence of this term would completely modify the original properties of the model .",
    "in fact , being expression ( [ max ] ) quadratic in the gauge fields , it can not be considered as a true perturbation term , as it will be responsible for the presence of massive excitations in the spectrum of the theory . rather , the presence of the maxwell term in the effective action @xmath31 will give rise to the existence of two distinct regimes corresponding to the long and short distance behaviors , respectively .",
    "for distances larger than the inverse of the mass parameters @xmath29 @xmath32 ( _ i.e. _ , the low energy regime ) , the topological term will prevail , _ _",
    "_ _ while the maxwell term will become the relevant one at short distances ( _ i.e. , _ the high - energy regime ) . in general",
    ", the computation of the correlator ( [ corr - top ] ) for arbitrary surfaces in the presence of the maxwell term is a very difficult task , mainly due to the metric dependence of the propagator .",
    "indeed , in the abelian three - dimensional maxwell - chern - simons case no closed analytic expression for the correlator ( [ c - s - l ] ) has been found so far , even in the simpler case in which the curves @xmath21 are two circles .",
    "the inclusion of the maxwell term is beyond the aim of the present paper , being presently under investigation .",
    "we would like to remark that , in the low energy regime , a useful local gauge invariant field redefinition has been recently applied @xcite for the maxwell - chern - simons theory to compute the corrections to the correlator ( [ c - s - l ] ) for two coinciding curves @xmath33 as power series in the inverse of the mass .",
    "this field redefinition can be also generalized to the present case and is expected to be suitable for the characterization of the maxwell contributions in the low energy regime @xcite .",
    "in order to analyse the aforementioned nonrenormalization properties of the linking number , let us proceed by computing the correlator @xmath34    in the case in which the total action @xmath35 is chosen to be @xmath36    where @xmath37 is an arbitrary parameter with negative mass dimension , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are respectively the curvatures of the gauge fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "notice that the normal ordering prescription has been adopted for the quartic interaction , allowing us to rule out tadpoles diagrams and @xmath2 are each gauge invariant . ] .",
    "the action @xmath35 is invariant under the gauge transformations @xmath40 remark that the transformations @xmath41 are reducible and therefore the quantization procedure will require the introduction of ghosts for ghosts . in order to gauge fix the action @xmath42 we choose the linear landau tansverse condition    @xmath43    which implies that the whole set of ghosts for ghosts completely decouples , due to the abelian character of the theory .",
    "thus , for the propagator we get    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the green function of the laplacian @xmath46 since the two surfaces @xmath47 must be homologically trivial @xcite    @xmath48 we can suppose that they are contained in a region of @xmath49 diffeomorphic to the flat euclidean space @xcite , but we do not consider these particular cases here . ]",
    "@xmath50 . in this case , the green function is given by    @xmath51 } \\frac{^1}{\\left| x - y\\right| ^{n-2}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 denotes the euclidean distance between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "let us now give the elementary wick contractions which shall be needed for the evaluation of the feynman diagrams .",

    "for the three - dimensional case , in which @xmath69 @xmath70 are two smooth oriented nonintersecting curves , this diagram can be drawn as follows    in the above figure , the dashed , the wavy and the double lines refer respectively to the wick contractions @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "apart from an irrelevant global symmetry coefficient , the feynman integral corresponding to the diagram of @xmath73 is given by @xmath74    in the analysis of the above expression it is worth to observe that the two fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 , lying on the hypersurfaces @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are respectively wick - contracted with @xmath79 and @xmath80 . from the explicit form of the propagator @xmath61 , we see that the term in the second line of @xmath62 yields a total derivative on the closed hypersurface @xmath77 ; implying that this term gives a vanishing contribution . the same result also holds for the contribution coming from the propagator @xmath60  of @xmath81 .",
    "it is worth remarking that this argument relies only on the fact that the two surfaces @xmath77 and @xmath70 are closed .",
    "therefore , it applies to the higher - order contributions as well . as a consequence",
    ", all the wick contractions entering the feynman diagrams will lead to a product of delta functions .",
