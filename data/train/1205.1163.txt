    "this paper is concerned with stability in the numerical solution of initial - boundary value problems for time - dependent multidimensional diffusion equations containing mixed spatial - derivative terms , @xmath1 here @xmath2 is any given integer and @xmath3 denotes any given real , symmetric , positive semidefinite @xmath4 matrix .",
    "the spatial domain is taken as @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "multidimensional diffusion equations with mixed derivative terms play an important role , notably , in the field of financial option pricing theory . here",
    "these terms represent correlations between underlying stochastic processes , such as for asset prices , volatilities or interest rates , see e.g. @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider for given @xmath7 $ ] the following useful condition on the relative size of the mixed derivative coefficients , @xmath8 clearly , @xmath9 yields the smallest possible mixed derivative coefficients ; they all vanish in this case .",
    "subsequently , @xmath10 admits the largest possible mixed derivative coefficients , given that matrix @xmath11 is positive semidefinite . in most applications in financial mathematics",
    "it turns out that ( [ gamma ] ) holds with certain known @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely , such @xmath13 can be determined from the pertinent correlation coefficients .",
    "the aim of our present paper is to effectively use this knowledge about @xmath13 in the stability analysis of numerical schemes , discussed below , so as to arrive at weaker sufficient stability conditions than those obtained when considering @xmath10 .",
    "semidiscretization of initial - boundary value problems for multidimensional diffusion equations ( [ pde ] ) leads to initial value problems for very large systems of stiff ordinary differential equations , @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a given real @xmath16 matrix and @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 are given real @xmath20 vectors . for the efficient numerical solution of ( [ ode ] ) , splitting schemes of the alternating direction implicit ( adi ) type form an attractive means .",
    "these schemes employ a splitting of the matrix @xmath15 that corresponds to the different spatial directions , leading to a substantial reduction in the amount of computational work per time step compared to common implicit methods such as crank  nicolson .",
    "adi schemes constitute a popular class of numerical methods for multidimensional equations in financial mathematics , where mixed derivative terms are ubiquitous .",
    "originally adi schemes were proposed and analyzed for equations without mixed derivatives , see e.g. @xcite . to formulate adi schemes in the presence of mixed derivative terms , consider a splitting of the matrix @xmath15 into @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents all mixed derivative terms in ( [ pde ] ) and @xmath23 represents the derivative term in the @xmath24-th spatial direction for @xmath25 . split the vector function @xmath26 in an analogous way , @xmath27 and define @xmath28 let parameter @xmath29 be given .",

    "the @xmath23 parts for @xmath25 are successively treated in an _ implicit _ fashion .    in its general form ( [ do ] ) the douglas scheme has been considered e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "special instances include the well - known adi schemes of douglas & rachford @xcite , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and of brian @xcite and douglas @xcite , where @xmath40 and @xmath42 .",
    "mckee & mitchell @xcite first proposed the do scheme for equations ( [ pde ] ) where a mixed derivative term is present , with @xmath43 .",
    "it is readily shown that if @xmath22 is nonzero then the classical order of consistency of the do scheme is just one , for any given @xmath0 .",
    "the cs , mcs and hv schemes can be viewed as different extensions to the do scheme .",
    "they each perform a second explicit prediction stage followed by @xmath44 implicit correction stages .",
    "the cs scheme was introduced in @xcite and attains a classical order equal to two ( independently of @xmath22 ) if @xmath42 .",
    "the mcs scheme was defined in @xcite and possesses a classical order equal to two for any given @xmath0 .",
    "note that the cs and mcs schemes are identical if @xmath42 . the hv scheme was constructed in @xcite and was proposed for equations with mixed derivative terms in @xcite .",
    "like the mcs scheme , the hv scheme possesses the favorable property of having a classical order equal to two for any given @xmath0 .    for the stability analysis in this paper the following linear scalar _ test equation",
    "_ is relevant , @xmath45 with complex constants @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "application of any given adi scheme in the case of test equation ( [ test ] ) gives rise to a linear iteration of the form @xmath48 here @xmath49 is a given , fixed , multivariate rational function and @xmath50 ( @xmath47 ) . the iteration is stable if @xmath51 for the schemes ( [ do ] ) , ( [ cs ] ) , ( [ mcs ] ) , ( [ hv ] ) it is readily verified that @xmath52 , respectively , where @xmath53      for the semidiscretization of ( [ pde ] ) we replace all spatial derivatives by second - order central finite differences on a rectangular grid with constant mesh width @xmath54 in the @xmath55direction ( @xmath56 ) :    [ discretization ] ( u_x_ix_i ) _ & & , + ( u_x_ix_j ) _ & & + & & + , ij .    here @xmath57 and the unit vectors @xmath58 denote multi - indices , @xmath59 stands for @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) are given real parameters with @xmath63 .",
    "the righthand side of ( [ discretization]b ) is the most general second - order finite difference formula for the mixed derivative @xmath64 that is based on a centered 9-point stencil .",
    "if @xmath65 , then ( [ discretization]b ) reduces to the standard 4-point formula @xmath66 in the literature also the choices @xmath67 and @xmath68 are frequently considered .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the stability of the four adi schemes ( [ do])([hv ] ) in the application to semidiscretized multidimensional diffusion equations ( [ pde ] ) where the condition ( [ gamma ] ) on the size of the mixed derivative coefficients is effectively taken into account .",
    "our stability analysis is equivalent to the well - known von neumann ( fourier ) analysis .",
    "accordingly , ( [ pde ] ) is considered with constant diffusion matrix @xmath11 and periodic boundary condition and stability pertains to the @xmath69-norm .",
    "the obtained semidiscrete matrices @xmath23 ( @xmath47 ) are then all normal and commuting and can therefore be unitarily diagonalized by a single matrix . for any given adi scheme ,",
    "one thus arrives at the stability requirement ( [ stab ] ) with @xmath46 eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath23 ( @xmath47 ) .    upon substituting discrete fourier modes into ( [ discretization ] )",

    "further , @xmath76    stability results for adi schemes pertinent to ( [ gamma ] ) in the case of @xmath77 were derived by craig & sneyd  @xcite for the do and cs schemes and by in t hout & welfert @xcite for the mcs and hv schemes . for",

    "the useful result was proved here that the lower bound @xmath80 is sufficient for unconditional stability ( whenever @xmath81 ) .",
    "the present paper substantially extends the work of @xcite reviewed above .",
    "section  [ main ]  contains the two main results of this paper .",
    "the first main result is theorem  [ theorem1 ] , which provides for each of the do , cs , mcs , hv schemes in @xmath43 and @xmath82 spatial dimensions a _ sufficient _ condition on the parameter @xmath0 for unconditional stability under ( [ gamma ] ) for arbitrary given @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "the second main result is theorem  [ theorem2 ] .",
    "this yields for any of the four adi schemes , any spatial dimension @xmath2 and any @xmath7 $ ] a _ necessary _ condition on @xmath0 for unconditional stability under ( [ gamma ] ) . for each scheme ,",
    "the obtained necessary and sufficient conditions coincide if @xmath43 or @xmath82 .",
    "section  [ numexp ] presents numerical illustrations to the two main theorems .",
    "the final section [ concl ] gives conclusions and issues for future research .",
    "in the following we always make the minor assumption that the matrix @xmath84 with @xmath85 ( @xmath56 ) is positive semidefinite .",

    "we note that this assumption on @xmath88 is weaker than the corresponding assumption that was made in @xcite .",
    "this section gives two lemmas that shall be used in the proofs of the main results below .",

    "the result for the other two boundary parts is the same , which completes the proof .",
    "the subsequent analysis relies upon four key properties of the scaled eigenvalues ( [ eig ] ) .",

    "next , using the cauchy ",
