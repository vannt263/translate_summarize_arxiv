    "the kinetic of evolution of the system of spins in thin films of yttrium - iron - garnets in the presence of a constant magnetic field , and being excited by a source of rf - radiation which drives the system towards far - removed from equilibrium conditions , has been reported in detailed experiments performed by demokritov et al .",
    "these experimental results have evidenced the occurrence of an unexpected large enhancement of the population of the magnons in the state lowest in energy in their energy dispersion relation .",
    "that is , the energy pumped on the system instead of being redistributed among the magnons in such non - thermal conditions is transferred to the mode lowest in frequency ( with a fraction of course being dissipated to the surrounding media ) .",
    "some theoretical studies along certain approaches has been presented by several authors ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; we proceed here to describe the phenomenon within a complete thermo - statistical description ensemble formalism .",
    "such phenomenon has been referred - to as a non - equilibrium bose - einstein condensation , which then would belong to a family of three types of bec :    the original one is the bec in many - boson particle systems in equilibrium at very low temperatures , which follows when their de broglie thermal wave length becomes larger than their mean separation distance , and presenting some typical hallmarks ( spontaneous symmetry breaking , long - range coherence , etc . ) . aside from the case of superfluidity , bec was realized in systems consisting of atomic alkali gases contained in traps .",
    "a nice tutorial review is due to a. j. leggett @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a second type of bec is the one of boson - like quasi - particles , that is , those associated to elementary excitations in solids ( e.g. phonons , excitons , hybrid excitations , etc . ) , when in equilibrium at extremely low temperatures .",
    "a well studied case is the one of an exciton - polariton system confined in microcavities ( a near two - dimensional sheet ) , exhibiting the classic hallmarks of a bec @xcite .",
    "the third type , the one we are considering here , is the case of boson - like quasi - particles ( associated to elementary excitations in solids ) which are driven out of equilibrium by external perturbative sources .",
    "d. snoke @xcite has properly noticed that the name bec can be misleading ( some authors call it `` resonance '' , e.g. in the case of phonons @xcite ) , and following this author it is better not to be haggling about names , and we introduce the nomenclature nefbec ( short for non - equilibrium frhlich - bose - einstein condensation for the reasons stated below ) .",
    "as noticed , here we consider the case of magnons ( boson - like quasi - particles ) , demonstrating that nefbec of magnons is another example of a phenomenon common to many - boson systems embedded in a thermal bath ( in the conditions that the interaction of both generates non - linear processes ) when driven sufficiently away from equilibrium by the action of an external pumping source and which display possible applications in the technologies of devices and medicine .",
    "00.00.0000    a first case was evidenced by * herbert frhlich * who considered the many boson system consisting of polar vibration ( lo phonons ) in biopolymers under dark excitation ( metabolic energy pumping ) and embedded in a surrounding fluid@xcite . from a science , technology and innovation ( sti ) point of view",
    "it was considered to have implications in medical diagnosis@xcite .",
    "more recently has been considered to be related to brain functioning and artificial intelligence@xcite .",
    "a second case is the one of acoustic vibration ( ac phonons ) in biological fluids , involving nonlinear anharmonic interactions and in the presence of pumping sonic waves , with eventual sti relevance in supersonic treatments and imaging in medicine@xcite .",
    "a third one is that of excitons ( electron - hole pairs in semiconductors ) interacting with the lattice vibrations and under the action of rf - electromagnetic fields ; on a sti aspect , the phenomenon has been considered for allowing a possible exciton - laser in the thz frequency range called `` excitoner''@xcite .",
    "a fourth one is the case of magnons already referred to @xcite , which we here analyze in depth .",
    "the thermal bath is constituted by the phonon system , with which a nonlinear interaction exists , and the magnons are driven arbitrarily out of equilibrium by a source of electromagnetic radio frequency @xcite .",
    "technological applications are related to the construction of sources of coherent microwave radiation @xcite .",
    "there exist two other cases of nebec ( differing from nefbec ) where the phenomenon is associated to the action of the pumping procedure of drifting electron excitation , namely ,    00.00.0000    a fifth one consists in a system of longitudinal acoustic phonons driven away from equilibrium by means of drifting electron excitation ( presence of an electric field producing an electron current ) , which has been related to the creation of the so - called saser , an acoustic laser device , with applications in computing and imaging @xcite .    a sixth one involving a system of lo - phonons driven away from equilibrium by means of drifting electron excitation , which displays a condensation in an off - center small region of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "we describe here item number 4 , namely , a system of magnons excited by an external pumping source . for that purpose",
    ", we consider a system of @xmath0 localized spins in the presence of a constant magnetic field , being pumped by a rf - source of radiation driving them out of equilibrium while embedded in a thermal bath consisting of the phonon system ( the lattice vibrations ) in equilibrium with an external reservoir at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the microscopic state of the system is characterized by the full hamiltonian of spins and lattice vibrations after going through holstein - primakov and bogoliubov transformations@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the characterization of the macroscopic state of the magnon system is done in terms of the thermo - mechanical statistics based on the framework of a non - equilibrium statistical ensemble formalism ( nesef for short)@xcite .",
    "other modern approach consists in the use of computational modeling@xcite ( developed after non - equilibrium molecular dynamics@xcite ) .",
    "it may be noticed that nesef is a systematization and an extension of the essential contributions of several renowned authors following the brilliant pioneering work of ludwig boltzmann .",
    "the formalism introduces the fundamental properties of historicity and irreversibility in the evolution of the nonequilibrium system where dissipative and pumping processes are under way .    in terms of the dynamics generated by this full hamiltonian the equations of evolution of the macroscopic state of the system",
    "are obtained in the framework of the nesef - based nonlinear quantum kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "we call the attention to the fact that the evolution equations are the quantum mechanical equations of motion averaged over the nonequilibrium ensemble , with the nesef - kinetic theory providing a practical way of calculation .    the paper is organized as follows :    in section 2 the theoretical background is described ; in section 3",
    "is presented the evolution of the nonequilibrium macrostate of the magnon system ; in section 4 nefbec in yig is studied ; in section 5 the decay of the condensate is analyzed ; finally , in section 6 we present additional considerations and concluding remarks . in the appendices",

    "<S> the complex behavior emerges after a threshold of the exciting intensity is attained . </S>",
    "<S> it is inhibited at higher intensities when the magnon - magnon interaction drives the magnons to internal thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> the observed behavior of the relaxation to equilibrium after the end of the pumping pulse is also accounted for and the different processes fully described . </S>"
