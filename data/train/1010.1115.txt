    "more than ninety years ago @xcite had already realized that the period changes of a cepheid - like pulsator would give information on the changes of the physics of the star s interior during its evolution .",
    "the potential of measuring the rate of stellar evolution seemed to be fulfilled when @xcite discovered that the periods of the rrab stars in omega centauri were predominantly increasing .",
    "the subsequent observations of rr lyrae stars in other globular clusters , however , failed to demonstrate the direct connection between the detected period changes and horizontal - branch ( hb ) evolution . the observed large period decreases , the random and/or abrupt period changes could not be reconciled with steady evolutionary effects .",
    "it has been , however , argued that evolutionary period changes must be present in individual stars and must be observable , at least on long time-scales.globular clusters with dozens , hundreds of rr lyrae stars are ideal targets for such studies , the mean value of the period - change rates of a large sample of rr lyrae stars of a globular cluster must show the trend of their evolution .",
    "indeed , @xcite proved that the mean period - change rates observed in globular clusters were consistent with synthetic hb models , if the hb - types of the clusters were also considered .",
    "the generally adopted procedure for investigating the period changes of variable stars is the construction and interpretation of their @xmath0 diagrams .",
    "this plots the difference between the observed times ( @xmath5 ) of a particular phase , usually the maximum or the mid - point on the ascending branch of the light curve and the predicted time of the same phase ( @xmath6 ) , calculated according to an accepted ephemeris .",
    "however , using today s computational techniques , the @xmath0 data are often calculated as the time shift between the entire observed light curve and the normal light curve , rather than from one specific phase .",
    "this method gives more stable results . if the @xmath0 diagram is a linear or quadratic function of time , then the period is constant or continuously changing at a constant rate .    in order to explain the complex nature of some @xmath0 diagrams , i.e. the irregular behaviour of the period variations that masks the evolutionary changes ,",
    "several suggestions have been put forward in the past .",
    "the accumulation of random variations ( some sort of noise ) in the period may show different drifts in the @xmath0 diagram as a typical realization of a random walk , even if the period noise has a gaussian distribution ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the appearance of this effect on the @xmath0 diagram , however , strongly depends on the parameters of the probability density function of the period noise , and it does not reflect real period changes .",
    "@xcite suggested a mechanism for the occurrence of irregularities in the pulsation period . according to their theory , random mixing events through the semiconvective zone",
    "cause the composition profile of the star s core to be altered .",
    "this produces changes in its hydrostatic structure , resulting in abrupt and continuous period changes of both signs .",
    "@xcite attributed the irregular period changes to hydromagnetic effects taking place in the atmosphere of the pulsating star . @xcite and",
    "@xcite modelled the effect of mass loss on the period changes of rr lyrae stars , while @xcite noticed that binarity might lead to long - term oscillation in the star s observed pulsation period .",
    "messier 5 ( ngc 5904 ) is one of the globular clusters that are richest in rr lyrae stars .",
    "the period changes of the cluster s rr lyrae stars were already investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite using baselines ranging from seventy to one hundred years . in these previous studies ,",
    "no photometric data were available for nearly two decades between 1970 and 1990 , and the most recent period - change study @xcite concerned only 30 variables .",
    "therefore , with the addition of archival data , the reexamination of the period changes of a larger sample of variables is desirable .",
    "now the observational baseline extends over a century , and the previously published observations , combined with the unpublished ones from the las campanas and konkoly observatories , render almost continuous coverage for the last fifty years of the 20th century .",
    "this provides the motivation for the present study of period changes of rr lyrae stars in the globular cluster m5 .",
    "the first investigation of the variable stars in m5 was carried out by @xcite .",
    "he made use of 111 plates obtained during the years 1895 to 1908 with the 13-inch boyden , the 11-inch draper and the 24-inch bruce telescopes mostly at arequipa , peru with exposure times ranging from 20 to 100 min .",
    "this collection was supplemented with 12 photographs taken at the mount wilson 60-inch reflector with 1014 min exposure times in 1912 .",
    "bailey published brightness estimates for about eighty rr lyrae stars , and these observations provide a firm starting point for the study of period changes of the rr lyrae stars in m5 .",
    "@xcite studied the variables on the basis of a collection of 59 plates mostly with double exposures ( in all 113 exposures ) taken with the mount wilson 60-inch telescope on eight different nights in 1917 .",
    "shapley did not publish his measurements , and likely they have gone astray . therefore , the plates were measured anew , and magnitudes of 62 rr lyrae stars were published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the variables in m5 was made by @xcite .",
    "he investigated the period changes of the cluster variables , and noted that the light curve of some stars showed rw dra - type variation ( now called blazhko effect ) .",
    "the observations consisted of 74 and 7 plates taken with the 60-inch reflector of the mount wilson observatory in the years 1934 and 1935 , respectively . the brightness of 92 rr lyrae stars were measured or estimated on this material .",
    "comprehensive studies of the period changes of rr lyraes in m5 have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite , independently of each another .",
    "coutts & sawyer hogg published magnitudes of 66 rr lyrae variables of m5 measured on 157 plates taken with the 74-inch telescope of the david dunlap observatory between 1936 and 1966 .",
    "kukarkin & kukarkina s material ( 181 plates ) was collected with the 40-cm astrograph at crimea in the years 19521968 . due to the severe crowding effect near the centre of the cluster and the close companions in some cases ,",

    "the 1981 to 1991 plates were measured later by c. clement .",

[ figalfa ] , and the largest value of the normalised period variation versus period",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ deltap ] . from these figures",
    "it can be immediately seen that in m5 ( like in other globular clusters ) there are variables with extreme @xmath69 values .",
    "these extreme period changes occur among rrab rather than among rrc stars according to the study of @xcite .    in our sample",
    ", there are three rrab stars with extreme period - change rates , two stars ( v5 and v81 ) with large negative and one ( v70 ) with large positive values .",
    "v70 lies far from the cluster centre , so it was not included in any of the ccd studies .",
    "therefore , only its photographic @xmath7 magnitude is available .",
    "the mean @xmath14 brightness of v70 is one of the faintest among the whole sample , indicating that v70 can not be in a highly evolved evolutionary phase .",
    "we thus suppose that the period changes of these three stars are not induced by evolutionary effects . since their extreme values strongly influence the mean period - change rates , the averages and the most - probable values of the period changes are also derived excluding them ( see the second part of table  [ beta ] ) .",
    "the most - probable @xmath69 and @xmath70 values for rrab and for all the 52 stars correspond to small positive rates , while the mean values have very small positive and negative @xmath70 and @xmath69 values , respectively .",
    "we thus conclude that , on the average , the period - change rate of rr lyrae stars in m5 are very close to zero .",
    "we also note that the median rates of the period changes for all the different samples is zero .",
    "this conclusion confirms the result of the previous studies @xcite on an extended baseline and larger sample , and is in good agreement with the prediction of lee s ( 1991 ) calculation on the stellar evolution  period change connection : the mean ( median ) rate of period change should be close to zero ( 0.0050.010 dmyr@xmath32 ) for clusters with hb - type like m5 .",
    "an other aspect of the problem of period changes is the distribution of the direction of the changes , whether the proportion of the decreasing and increasing periods reflects the evolutionary state of the rr lyrae stars of a globular cluster .",
    "the models of post - zahb evolution @xcite predict that after an initial ` hook ' to the red caused by shell readjustment , rr lyrae stars evolve blueward ( with decreasing periods ) across the instability strip , and that when they have depleted the helium in their cores , they increase in luminosity and evolve redward ( with increasing periods ) .",
    "the histograms of the distribution of the period - change rates @xmath70 and @xmath69 are shown in fig .",
    "this figure suggests a slight excess of rrab stars with small increasing period .",
    "our sample has 19 ab stars with increasing period , contrasting with 14 ab variables with decreasing period , while 11 ab stars have constant period . among",
    "the rrc stars 2 have increasing , 4 decreasing and 5 constant period .",
    "hence , the full sample contains 21 variables with increasing , 18 with decreasing and 16 with constant period .",
    "the small number of the c - type stars obviously precludes the possibility of their distinct statistical treatment .",

    "rrab and rrc stars are shown by gray and black areas , respectively . although there is some hint that small positive period values are in excess to negative ones in rrab stars , this effect statistically is only weakly significant . on the average , the period - change rates of m5 variables are very close to zero . , width=336 ]    a simple test can prove that the observed small excess of rrab stars with increasing period is only weakly significant .",
    "if we distribute equally the stars with @xmath73 , we end up with 24 or 25 positive and 20 or 19 negative .",
    "supposing that the likelihood of the positive and negative period change is equal , the expected value of the binomial distribution is 22 with a variance of 3.32 .",
    "for the whole sample , the expected value is 27.5 with a variance of 3.71 , so the distribution of the @xmath70 value signs does not provide clear statistical evidence for an excess of period increases among all the m5 rr lyrae stars .",
    "this might be a consequence of the fact that the mean period - change rate of the variables is in agreement with the @xmath74zero mean period - change rates of the variables .",
    "in m3 , another ooi - type cluster , @xcite found 21 rrab stars with increasing and 14 with decreasing period , i.e. a small excess of increasing periods .",
    "this might be explained by that a larger fraction of the rrab stars of m3 shows ooii characteristics @xcite than that of the m5 rrab variables .",
    "at the same time , the rr lyrae stars of the well - observed ooii - type clusters like m15 @xcite and @xmath75 cen @xcite show a definite surplus of increasing periods .",
    "this implies that the majority of the variables in these clusters are evolving across the instability strip from blue to red .",
    "all these results strengthen that the oosterhoff properties of globular - cluster variables are strongly connected to their horizontal - branch evolutionary state @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that @xcite called attention to the fact that no cluster exhibits a large plurality of decreasing period .    on the whole ,",
    "the hb evolution is a plausible explanation for increasing periods .",
    "stars within the instability strip evolve rapidly from blue to red , toward the end of core helium burning , producing a large positive rate of period change . in this respect",
    ", it is worth mentioning the difference between the period - change behaviour of the rrab stars of the clusters m3 and m5 .",
    "although both clusters belong to oosterhoff - type i and resemble each other in many aspects , m5 has fewer strongly increasing periods than m3 .",
    "in m5 , only five out of the 44 rrab ( 11 per cent ) have very large period - increase rate ( @xmath76 dmyr@xmath32 ) , while in m3 , 29 per cent of the rrab stars have . in other ooi - type clusters , m14 @xcite , m28 @xcite and ngc 7006 @xcite the frequency of rrab stars with strongly increasing periods are 16 , 8 and 10 per cent , respectively .",
    "this simple statistic shows that the m5 rrab stars behave like other ooi - type clusters , and only m3 behaves somewhat differently .",
    "brightness versus period diagram of the rr lyrae stars in m5 .",
    "symbols are the same as in fig .",
    "[ deltap ] .",
    "the period - change rate and its direction are indicated by horizontal lines .",
    "rrab stars with period decrease are characterized by short period and fainter luminosities , large period increase occurs at longer period , more luminous variables . , width=340 ]        one of the most intriguing issues connected with the period changes of rr lyrae stars is the large negative values of @xmath70 , observed in different clusters . among the 44 rrab stars of m5 that have parabolic or straight - line @xmath0 diagrams , nine ( 20 per cent ) show decreasing periods with as high rate as @xmath77 dmyr@xmath32 , that certainly can not be explained by canonical hb evolution .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mean period of the sample of 44 rrab stars is 0.5622 d , whereas the mean period of the nine ab stars with fast decreasing period is significantly less , 0.5127 d.    a comparison with other well - studied globular clusters proves that the occurrence of rrab stars with very fast period decreases is a general feature , characteristic of both oosterhoff - types . for example , 11 out of the 35 rrab stars ( 31 per cent ) in m3 @xcite and 9 out of the 42 ab variables ( 21 per cent ) in ngc 6934 @xcite exhibit large period decreases ( @xmath78 dmyr@xmath32 ) .",
    "the ooii - type clusters also have ( perhaps relatively less in numbers ) rrab stars with strong period decreases . in @xmath75 cen ,",
    "29 rrab stars of the chemically homogeneous group have linear period changes , and among them , four ( 14 per cent ) have strong period decreases ( table 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in m15",
    ", there are two out of 13 rrab stars ( 15 per cent ) that show strong period decreases @xcite . the trend that the mean period of the ab stars with fast period decreases is shorter than the mean period of the whole sample also holds for the clusters mentioned .    to resolve the contradition between canonical hb evolutionary model predictions and the observed frequency of strong period decreases",
    ", it is generally supposed that most of the period changes are due to some kind of ` noise ' rather than to evolutionary effects .",
    "@xcite have found that the mixing events at the convective core edge , the transfer of helium into the convective core and the subsequent chemical readjustment of the semi - convective zone around the core , is an intrinsically noisy process that can lead to large period - decrease rates .",
    "recently , @xcite have given an alternative explanation for the frequent occurrence of strong period decreases among the cluster variables .",
    "they constructed pre - zahb evolutionary tracks for a chemical composition appropriate to the globular cluster m3 , and investigated the period - change behaviour of variables in the final approach to the zahb location .",
    "they have found that , before settling on the zahb , the variables are subject to a strong period decrease with the most likely @xmath70 values around @xmath79 dmyr@xmath32 , but more extreme values ( @xmath80 dmyr@xmath32 ) may also take place .",
    "the model simulations have also shown that some percent of the rr lyrae population are in the pre - zahb evolutionary state , and the pre - zahb pulsators are expected to have longer periods than the bona fide hb pulsators . as m5 resembles m3 in different aspects , therefore the model calculations of @xcite can be compared with our results . the high percentage of variables with decreasing periods and the relatively shorter mean periods of these stars in m5 show that , likely , the pre - zahb evolution can not fully explain the observations .",
    "nevertheless , further model calculations of the pre - zahb evolutionary phase may lead to more satisfactory results .",
    "it is perplexing , however , why the observed period - increase rates are in very good agreement with evolutionary predictions , if the period - decrease rates are not .",
    "if this is indeed the case , some significant difference between rr lyrae stars with increasing and decreasing period rates should be found , but observationally , there is no evidence of any difference between these stars .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the evolutionary effects are apparent in the different diagrams of cluster variables , e.g. period - amplitude , period - brightness , etc",
    ". diagrams . fig .  [ vp ] and fig .",
    "[ vap ] show the relationships between the intensity - averaged mean @xmath9 brightness @xmath81 and period , as well as between the @xmath9 amplitude ( @xmath22 ) and the period .",
    "the period - change rate and its direction are indicated by horizontal lines in both figures .",
    "the @xmath81 versus period plot displays that the variables with longer periods have higher luminosity and constant or increasing period ( the only exception is v9 with a very slow @xmath82 dmyr@xmath32 decrease ) . the long - period sequence in the @xmath22 versus period diagram shows the same trend . in accordance with evolutionary theories these stars are at an advanced evolutionary stage moving off from the hb @xcite .",
    "one of the most important issues that should be addressed , is the irregular period changes of rr lyrae stars in globular clusters . scrutinizing the @xmath0 diagrams of 81 rr lyrae stars in m5 , it turned out that 31 out of them ( 38 per cent ) can not be satisfactorily fitted by straight line or parabola . according to the number of inflection points and the order of the polynomial fit",
    ", these diagrams were classified as moderately or strongly irregular ( see index ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' in the middle column of the ` remarks ' in table  [ tabla ] ) .",
    "if we separately investigate the irregular period behaviour of the fundamental - mode and first - overtone pulsators , we find that more than the half of the c - type stars ( 10/18 ) have complex @xmath0 diagrams , while one third of the rrab stars ( 21/63 ) have irregular period changes .",
    "the fact that irregular period behaviour is more frequent among rrc stars than rrab stars has already been noted by @xcite in a similar study of the period - change behaviour of the @xmath75 cen variables .",
    "a comparison with other clusters rrab and rrc stars prove that this period behaviour tends to be a general feature . in m14 @xcite and in ngc 7006",
    "@xcite the frequency of irregular period changes of ab - stars are 20 and 14 percentages , while those of the c - type stars are 80 and 43 percentages , respectively .",
    "the most generally accepted explanation for the irregular period changes was put forward by @xcite .",
    "the mixing process within the semi - convective zone and the overshooting at the convective - core edge were found to be responsible for the non - evolutionary changes .",
    "these physical processes , however , can not account for the different period - change behaviour of the rrab and rrc stars .",
    "another problem is that the observed irregular period changes are as large as 25@xmath83 @xmath84 in some cases ( e.g. in v4 , v14 , v18 , v52 and v72 ) occurring on time - scales of some tens of years only .",
    "although many parameters influence the time - scales and the resultant period - change values caused by mixing events , as an average value , 370 yr was derived for the time interval required to produce a period change of @xmath85 ( @xmath84 ) ( see fig . 9 in",
    "the two orders of magnitude discrepancy between observations and model predictions may give rise to some doubt that the rapid , irregular period variations of rr lyrae stars can indeed be generated by the proposed mixing events in the interior . to settle this issue , more detailed numerical modelling of the effect of the mixing events on the pulsation period is highly needed .        here",
    "we outline another approach to the interpretation of irregular period changes of rr lyrae stars .",
    "[ irreg ] shows that there is a striking connection between the irregular period changes and the blazhko effect of m5 rr lyrae stars .",
    "we omit the rrc stars from the following discussion , the detection of blazhko effect in these stars is difficult as the modulation amplitude is usually in the range of the photometric accuracy .",
    "the figure demonstrates that all rrab stars exhibiting very complex @xmath0 diagram , i.e. irregular period changes , have been found to show the blazhko effect , if the sample of variables with good enough photometry to detect light - curve variability is considered .",
    "it seems that the inverse statement is also true with only a few exceptions .",
    "two blazhko stars , v1 and v30 have constant period , and two , v5 and v58 have decreasing period with very high rates , @xmath86 dmyr@xmath32 and @xmath87 dmyr@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "if , however , the @xmath0 diagrams of field blazhko rr lyrae stars are considered , it can be immediately realized that the irregular ( from time to time abrupt ) period changes are followed by a long interval of linearly changing period , a period readjustment ( see e.g. the @xmath0 diagrams of xz cyg , rr gem , sz hya in fig . 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "on the basis of all this , the period changes of blazhko rr lyrae stars can not be identified with evolutionary effects , and should be left out of evolutionary considerations .",
    "if variables showing blazhko effect are omitted then the period - change rates of rrab stars with constant or linearly changing period ( 38 stars ) have small positive mean and most - probable values . if rrc stars are added to this sample ( 49 stars ) the mean and the most - probable values of the period - change rates hardly change .",
    "the last section of table  [ beta ] summarizes the mean period - change rates and the most - probable values if the blazhko rrab stars are left out of consideration .",
    "curiously enough , these values are in excellent agreement with hb - model predictions of @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the period - change rates of the rrab stars also changes when the blazhko stars are omitted .",
    "now , among the 38 rrab stars 11 , 9 and 18 have decreasing , constant and increasing period - change rates , respectively . in this case",
    ", a binomial distribution with equal likelihood of both period - change directions has a variance of 3.1 , while the difference between period changes is 7 , more than twice as large .",
    "so , in this sample , the period of rrab stars is dominantly increasing .",
    "the period changes of eighty - six m5 rr lyrae stars have been investigated .",
    "the published data have been supplemented by archival , previously unpublished observations covering the second half of the last century .",
    "the observations of m5 variables now provide an almost continuous time coverage for about a hundred - year time base , making the accurate study of the period changes possible .",
    "reliable @xmath0 diagrams ( phase diagrams ) were constructed for 81 rr lyrae , 62 rrab and 19 rrc stars .",
    "the @xmath0 plots of 44 rrab and 11 rrc stars could be well approximated by a straight line or parabola , indicating constancy or linear change of the pulsation period of these stars on the hundred - year time base of the observations .",
    "21 rr lyrae have increasing , 18 decreasing and 16 constant period .",
    "the excess of increasing period among rrab stars is slightly more pronounced , however , statistically that is still weakly significant . omitting blazhko variables",
    "the situation changes , there are 18 stars with increasing , 9 with constant and only 11 with decreasing period in this sample .",
    "the average , median and most - probable values of the period - change rates of m5 variables equals zero , or have very small , either positive or negative values for different subsamples . omitting the blazhko stars , however , the period - change rates indicate a small period increase on the average .",
    "its most - probable value for 49 stars is 0.009 dmyr@xmath32 , in very good accordance with predictions of synthetic hb - model results @xcite .",
    "large period - change rates ( both negative and positive ) characterize some of the shorter - period rrab stars , while variables with period longer than 0.6 d always have constant or increasing period .",
    "the observed rates of period increase are , in general , in good agreement with standard hb evolutionary model predictions , but most of the period - decrease rates are significantly larger than that canonical models would allow .",
    "the recent supposition of @xcite that connects these changes to pre - zahb evolution is a promising attempt , but fails to explain the statistics and the period distribution of these stars .",
    "more than one third of the @xmath0 diagrams of m5 rr lyrae stars can not be fitted solely by straight line or parabola , i.e. the period changes of these stars are moderately or strongly irregular .",
    "the pulsation periods of some of these stars vary by some @xmath88 d within relatively short time intervals ( 1030 yr ) .",
    "the irregular behaviour of the periods is more frequent among rrc stars , and it is rather characteristic of the shorter - period rrab stars .",
    "an important relation between the irregular period change and the blazhko effect has been revealed : in m5 , stars with strongly irregular period changes always have blazhko modulation .",
