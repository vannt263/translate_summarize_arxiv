    "in a recent paper @xcite , bender and milton carried out an investigation of the following non - hermitian hamiltonian : @xmath3 among other results , they provided analytical evidence for the remarkable property that its eigenvalues are real and positive .",
    "this hamiltonian and its field theory counterparts arise in the study of the zeros of the ising model partition function as a function of complex magnetic field , the so - called lee - yang zeros ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the distribution of zeros in the complex parameter plane of the partition function of a given system can yield useful information concerning its phase transitions . for the ising model ,",
    "the zeros lie on the imaginary magnetic field axis and , for imaginary field , the effective theory is an interacting scalar field theory with dominant interaction @xmath4 for small fluctuations@xcite .    in order to give a proper analytical demonstration of the reality of the eigenvalues of hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , as well as",
    "investigate the higher dimensional quantum field theory analogues , we require an expansion method which converges for finite , but otherwise arbitrary values of the coupling @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 .",
    "the method must therefore be necessarily nonperturbative in these parameters .",
    "bender and milton employed a variant of their previous @xmath0 expansion method @xcite , in which the interaction @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath7 . a taylor expansion in @xmath0 of the desired quantity ( @xmath8-point green function , @xmath9th .",
    "energy eigenvalue , etc . ) is obtained and then @xmath0 is set equal to one .",
    "the terms of the resulting series are nonperturbative in @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , in this method it is extremely difficult to go beyond first order in @xmath0 and hence test for convergence .    in the present paper",
    "we employ an alternative expansion method , the so - called linear @xmath0 expansion ( lde ) .",
    "the lde has been employed as a non - perturbative approximation method to study problems in , for example , @xmath10 theory@xcite , quantum chromodynamics@xcite , relativistic nuclear models@xcite , and electron dynamics in disordered systems@xcite .",
    "the method involves constructing a modified action which involves the original action of the theory , @xmath11 , and a soluble trial action , @xmath12 , containing one or more variational parameters @xmath13 : @xmath14 the green function of interest is evaluated as a power series in @xmath0 , which is then set equal to 1 . for the success of the method the trial action @xmath12 needs to be simple , so that one can perform high order calculations , but also as close to the true action as possible , so that expanding around @xmath12 is a reasonable procedure with a good chance of converging . although @xmath15 is independent of the @xmath16 , there is nonetheless a residual dependence on @xmath16 in the truncated series evaluated at @xmath17 , and it is therefore necessary to choose these parameters according to some well  defined criterion . perhaps the most commonly used criterion is the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) , according to which the @xmath16 are chosen to be stationary points of the truncated expansion , where the dependence is minimal .",
    "whatever criterion is adopted , it is to be applied at each order @xmath8 in the expansion , so that the @xmath16 become @xmath8dependent .",
    "this feature of the method is crucial for the convergence of the lde , which can be characterized as an order  dependent split between the bare and the interaction terms in the action . in many cases where the fixed split of conventional perturbation theory leads to a divergent series",
    ", the lde can be proved to lead to a convergent sequence of approximants .    in this paper",
    "we apply different variants of the lde to the @xmath2 potential in zero dimensions , where we give a proof of convergence of the expansion for the analogue of the vacuum persistence amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "we then go on to consider the one  dimensional problem and provide numerical evidence of convergence of the lde for the finite - temperature partition function and the ground - state energy .    in sec .",
    "ii , which deals with the zero - dimensional problem , we first describe how the conventional lde converges , but to the wrong answer .",
    "one possible resolution is to split the integral up for positive and negative @xmath19 and apply the pms separately to each integral@xcite . numerically , this gives a sequence of approximants converging to the correct answer , and we provide a proof of convergence of this procedure .",
    "this lde variant can be generalized to the path integral expression of the 1-d finite - temperature partition function .",
    "however , difficulties are encountered when applied to the ground - state energy , owing to the non - analyticity of the splitting procedure .",
    "we resolve this problem by using a modified @xmath0 expansion which involves a shift parameter .",
    "this retains the essential features of the integration splitting procedure , but has the advantage of being analytic , thus making the calculations straightforward to carry out and allowing the possibility of generalization to higher dimensions . in the last part of sec .",
    "ii , a numerical study of the shift method is carried out , and a proof of convergence provided using saddle - point techniques .    in sec .",
    "iii , where we deal with the quantum mechanical problem , we show that the conventional lde again fails",
    ". numerical evidence of convergence is given for the path integral expression of the partition function ( using both the splitting and shift techniques ) and especially for the ground state energy using the shift technique .",
    "in the conclusion we outline further directions , including proving convergence for the @xmath20-d problem and generalizing the shift method to the higher dimensional field theory analogues .",
    "the zero  dimensional analogue of the finite - temperature partition function in quantum mechanics , or the vacuum persistence amplitude in field theory , is the ordinary integral @xmath21 for simplicity we will take @xmath22 . in that case @xmath23 and we can set @xmath24 without loss of generality . in spite of the absence of the convergence factor",
    "the integral is still well  defined , and can be calculated by splitting up the integration range into @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and then rotating the contour by @xmath27 .",
    "the exact result , obtained in this way , is @xmath28 , to 15 significant figures .      in evaluating @xmath18 using the lde ,",
    "the standard approach is to modify the exponent simply by adding and subtracting a quadratic term , to give @xmath29 the procedure is then to expand @xmath30 to order @xmath31 , set @xmath17 and then choose @xmath32 by some criterion or other . in the absence of any additional information the most reasonable criterion is the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) , namely to choose @xmath33 as a stationary point of @xmath34 .    the truncated series is @xmath35 , with @xmath36 } \\frac{\\gamma(n+r+1/2)}{(2r)!(n-2r)!}\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda^3}\\right)^r .",
    "\\label{zn}\\ ] ] using ( [ zn ] ) , @xmath34 can be calculated to high order . however , the residual dependence on @xmath37 turns out to be radically different from the @xmath38 case discussed in @xcite , where , for odd @xmath8 there was a single maximum , and the value of @xmath18 at that maximum steadily approached the exact value as @xmath8 increased . as shown in fig .  1 , where @xmath39 is plotted against @xmath37 for @xmath40 ,",
    "the situation here is that there are extremely violent oscillations for small @xmath37 , which gradually decrease in amplitude as @xmath37 increases , with a final , very broad maximum lying above the exact value of @xmath18 .",
    "one s natural choice of a pms point for @xmath37 would be the position of this last maximum : the residual dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath37 around this point is much less than anywhere else on the graph .",
    "however , it turns out that the sequence @xmath41 , with @xmath33 so chosen , indeed converges , but to the wrong answer !",
    "the same is true of the previous minimum , and indeed none of the stationary points converges to the correct answer .",
    "this is a stark warning , in this admittedly somewhat pathological case , of the shortcomings of the pms .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scaling behaviour with @xmath8 of these @xmath33 is anomalous : for large @xmath8 they grow like @xmath8 , rather than the @xmath42 which would be expected from a saddle - point analysis and which indeed is obtained in the variants of the lde discussed in the following two subsections . in an estimation of the error @xmath43 on the lines of the double saddle  point procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , the interaction term @xmath2 would then be sub ",
    "dominant , a clear signal that one is on the wrong track .",
    "a possible resolution of this problem is to split up the integration range into positive and negative @xmath19 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and similarly for @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the taylor expansion of @xmath48 to order @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath37 is taken as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is real , and the integration contour rotated by @xmath52 , then @xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath46 we need to take @xmath55 and rotate the contour in the opposite direction , to obtain @xmath56 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath57 is very similar to the @xmath38 case discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for odd @xmath8",
    "there is a single maximum in @xmath51 , which steadily converges to the exact result .",
    "for @xmath58 the situation is depicted in fig .  2 , where we have multiplied @xmath57 by the appropriate factor of @xmath59 . the contrast with fig",
    ".  1 could hardly be more striking .",
    "the crucial difference between this and the nave application of the lde is that by splitting the integral we are in fact using two different ( complex conjugate ) values of @xmath33 for the two integrals rather than the same value for both .",
    "the proof of convergence of this procedure is similar to that for the @xmath38 case , though different in detail .",
    "the remainder @xmath60 is essentially given by the integral for the @xmath8th .",
    "coefficient in the expansion of @xmath61 , namely @xmath62 which can be estimated by saddle  point methods for large @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the pms value of @xmath63 scales as @xmath42 .",
    "writing @xmath64 and @xmath65 and using stirling s approximation for @xmath66 , the leading behaviour of the integral is @xmath67 where @xmath68 the saddle  point equation @xmath69 is @xmath70 which has two positive roots @xmath71 .",
    "what is required for convergence is that both @xmath72 and @xmath73 be negative , and then the rate of convergence is governed by the larger of the two .",
    "they become equal at the pms point , when @xmath74 is such that @xmath75 .",
    "numerically the solution of this equation is @xmath76 , when @xmath77 .",
    "thus the sequence of approximants converges like @xmath78 .",
    "if we were only concerned with zero dimensions this would be an entirely satisfactory resolution of the problem .",
    "however , in higher dimensions one is dealing with a _ functional _ integral , and the generalization of such a splitting procedure is fraught with difficulties , even though some progress can be made along these lines , as we show in sec .",
    "fortunately , consideration of the quantum mechanical problem suggests another solution , which is immediately generalizable to higher dimensions , namely to incorporate a linear term , or shift , into the @xmath0modified action .",
    "the motivation for introducing such a term is discussed briefly in sec .  iiic . in the context of the zero  dimensional",
    "model it is worth noting that one of the features of the successful stratagem of splitting the integration range and treating each half separately is that terms odd in @xmath19 survive the integration , whereas they cancel in the nave application of the @xmath0expansion . introducing a linear term into the @xmath0modified action",
    "also avoids such a cancellation , but in a simple algebraic way .",
    "thus , in zero dimensions the relevant modification of eq .",
    "( [ naive ] ) is @xmath79},\\ ] ] where we have introduced a shift @xmath80 , which will indeed turn out to be pure imaginary .",
    "notice that when @xmath17 this does reduce to the original integration , as the shift is then immaterial .    truncating the expansion at order @xmath31 and setting @xmath17 we now have the series @xmath35 , where @xmath81 } { 3r\\choose 2s } \\frac{\\gamma(n - r+s+1/2)}{r!(n - r)!\\lambda^{s+1/2}}(-1)^s g^r a^{3r-2s}.\\ ] ]    one can now search for double pms points in the two parameters @xmath82 , @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath83 there are several such points .",
    "for example , at order 16 there are ten solutions , with @xmath37 lying in the range 46 and @xmath82 close to 1 .",
    "there is no very convincing criterion for choosing between these multiple pms solutions , but they all agree with the exact answer up to the 7th .",
    "decimal place .",
    "however , the pms was only a means to an end , namely to obtain a sequence of approximants converging to the exact answer , and in the present case we can instead adopt this latter requirement directly as a criterion for choosing @xmath82 and @xmath37 .",
    "this can be done via a saddle  point analysis of the error @xmath60 .    as in the previous subsection",
    ", the error is essentially given by the expression for the @xmath8th .",
    "coefficient @xmath84 , which in the present case reads @xmath85^n.\\ ] ] the appropriate scaling for a saddle  point approximation in which both parameters play a non  trivial rle is @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "then the large@xmath8 behaviour of @xmath84 is @xmath88 where now ( again setting @xmath24 ) @xmath89 + 1.\\ ] ] the saddle  point equation in this case is a quartic : @xmath90 with four complex roots .",
    "the location of these roots is shown in fig .",
    "[ paths ] for typical values of @xmath74 and @xmath91 , when they occur as two pairs of the form @xmath92 . also shown in that diagram are the paths of stationary phase .",
    "it is necessary to know the geometry of these paths in order to determine which saddle points are encountered , and in what direction , when the contour is distorted from its original location along the real axis from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "in fact the required path goes through all four saddle points @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , in each case at a maximum of the integrand because of the intervening `` sinks '' @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath18 where the argument of the logarithm vanishes .",
    "the values of @xmath101 at the mirror points @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the complex conjugates of those at @xmath98 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "the criterion for convergence therefore reduces to ensuring that both @xmath102 and @xmath103 are negative .",
    "optimal convergence occurs when the two are equal .",
    "thus in the parameter space of @xmath74 and @xmath91 we solve the equation @xmath104 and then look for points where this common value is negative .",
    "we display the results as a contour plot in fig .",
    "[ cntr ] , where the outer contour corresponds to @xmath105 and the inner one to @xmath106 .",
    "any point within the outer contour will give convergence , while points within the inner contour will give convergence with an error smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "notice that there is quite a wide range of acceptable values of @xmath108 , but of course this does not include @xmath109 , which would correspond to the nave lde with no shift term .    in fig .",
    "[ cgce ] we demonstrate the nature of the numerical convergence up to @xmath40 for the optimal values @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "the abolute value of the error is shown , on a logarithmic scale .",
    "although this decrease lies within the predicted envelope , the error is periodically significantly smaller than the general trend .",
    "a similar pattern of convergence has been seen@xcite in the application of variational perturbation theory to the calculation of the strong  coupling coefficients of the quartic oscillator .    in conclusion ,",
    "the shift method described in this subsection involves a simple algebraic modification of the original integrand and an unambiguous choice of the two variational parameters according to the requirement of convergence .",
    "the method may be straightforwardly generalized to higher dimensions , where the calculations involved in the @xmath0 expansion are not significantly more complicated than in ordinary perturbation theory . in the case of quantum mechanics",
    "the analytic nature of the @xmath0modified hamiltonian allows one to go to very high orders , as we show in subsection iiic .",
    "we now return to the quantum mechanical problem armed with the insights gained from the zero  dimensional analogue .",
    "the initial evidence for the reality and positivity of the spectrum comes from a numerical analysis using the matrix method , whereby the hamiltonian is rewritten in terms of the raising and lowering operators of the bare hamiltonian and then regarded as a matrix @xmath112 in the infinite  dimensional space labelled by the occupation numbers @xmath9 .",
    "if this matrix is truncated at some finite order @xmath8 the resulting spectrum of eigenvalues can easily be calculated numerically , up to @xmath8 of the order of 100 . the pattern which emerges from such",
    "a calculation is that as @xmath8 increases more and more of the lower eigenvalues emerge as real numbers from the amalgamation of complex conjugate pairs .",
    "after emergence they each tend to a definite positive limit . the ground ",

    "also will be the finite  temperature partition function @xmath118 , which can be calculated to the desired accuracy by including a sufficient number of energy levels in the sum .    to our knowledge",
    "there is no proof of the convergence of the matrix method , and our ultimate goal will be to provide such a proof for a suitable generalization of the lde . in this section",
