    "<S> we generalize the concept of sato grassmannians of locally linearly compact topological vector spaces ( tate spaces ) to the category @xmath0 of the  locally compact objects \" of an exact category @xmath1 , and study some of their properties . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to generalize the kapranov dimensional torsor @xmath2 and determinantal gerbe @xmath3 for the objects of @xmath0 and unify their treatment in the _ determinantal torsor _ @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we then introduce a class of exact categories , that we call _ partially abelian exact _ , and prove that if @xmath1 is partially abelian exact , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are multiplicative in admissible short exact sequences . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 , the category of finite dimensional vector spaces on a field @xmath6 , we recover the case of the dimensional torsor and of the determinantal gerbe of a tate space , as defined by kapranov in @xcite , and reformulate its properties in terms of the waldhausen space @xmath7 of the exact category @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this approach is that it allows to define formally in the same way the grassmannians of the iterated categories @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we then prove that the category of tate spaces @xmath9 is partially abelian exact , which allows us to extend the results on @xmath10 and @xmath11 already known for tate spaces to 2-tate spaces , such as the multiplicativity of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for 2-tate spaces , as considered by arkhipov - kremnizer and frenkel - zhu . </S>"
