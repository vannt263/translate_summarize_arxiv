    "let @xmath0 be a closed oriented surface of genus @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be its mapping class group .",

    "@xmath4 is known to be homeomorphic to @xmath7 .",
    "hence we have a natural isomorphism @xmath8 on the other hand , by a theorem of earle  eells @xcite , the identity component of @xmath3 is contractible for @xmath1 so that the classifying space @xmath9 is an eilenberg  maclane space @xmath10 .",
    "therefore we have also a natural isomorphism @xmath11 thus the mapping class group serves as the orbifold fundamental group of the moduli space @xmath12 and at the same time it plays the role of the _ universal monodromy group _ for oriented @xmath0bundles .",
    "any cohomology class of the mapping class group can be considered as a characteristic class of oriented surface bundles and , over the rationals , it can also be identified as a cohomology class of the moduli space .",
    "the teichmller space @xmath4 and the moduli space @xmath12 are important objects primarily in complex analysis and algebraic geometry .",
    "many important results concerning these two spaces have been obtained following the fundamental works of ahlfors , bers and mumford .",
    "because of the limitation of our knowledge , we only mention here a survey paper of hain and looijenga @xcite for recent works on @xmath12 , mainly from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry , and a book by harris and morrison @xcite for basic facts as well as more advanced results .    from a topological point of view",
    ", fundamental works of harer @xcite on the homology of the mapping class group and also of johnson ( see @xcite ) on the structure of the torelli group , both in early @xmath13 s , paved the way towards modern topological studies of @xmath2 and @xmath12 . here",
    "the torelli group , denoted by @xmath14 , is the subgroup of @xmath2 consisting of those elements which act on the homology of @xmath0 trivially .",
    "slightly later , the author began a study of the classifying space @xmath9 of surface bundles which also belongs to topology .",
    "the intimate relationship between three universal spaces , @xmath15 and @xmath9 described above , imply that there should exist various interactions among the studies of these spaces which are peculiar to various branches of mathematics including the ones mentioned above .",
    "although it is not always easy to understand mutual viewpoints , we believe that doing so will enhance individual understanding of these spaces .    in this paper , we would like to survey some aspects of recent topological study of the mapping class group as well as the moduli space .",
    "more precisely , we focus on a study of the mapping class group which is related to the structure of the torelli group @xmath14 together with a natural action of the siegel modular group @xmath16 on some graded modules associated with the lower ( as well as other ) central series of @xmath14 . here",
    "it turns out that explicit descriptions of @xmath17invariant tensors of various @xmath17modules using classical symplectic representation theory , along the lines of kontsevich s fundamental works in @xcite , and also hain s recent work @xcite on @xmath14 using mixed hodge structures can play very important roles .",
    "these two points will be reviewed in  4 and  5 , respectively . in the final section (  6 ) , we describe several experimental results , with sketches of proofs , by which we would like to propose some possible directions for future research .",
    "this article can be considered as a continuation of our earlier papers @xcite .",
    "we would like to express our hearty thanks to r hain , n kawazumi and h nakamura for many enlightening discussions and helpful information .",
    "we also would like to thank c faber , s garoufalidis , m kontsevich , j levine , e looijenga , m matsumoto , j murakami and k vogtmann for helpful discussions and communications .",

    "it is a pleasure to thank m shishikura for help in handling mathematica .",
    "let us simply write @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "we have the intersection pairing @xmath20 which is a non - degenerate skew symmetric bilinear form on @xmath18 .",
    "the natural action of @xmath2 on @xmath18 , which preserves this pairing , induces the classical representation @xmath21 if we fix a symplectic basis of @xmath18 , then @xmath22 can be identified with the siegel modular group @xmath16 so that we can write @xmath23 the _ torelli group _ , denoted by @xmath14 , is defined to be the kernel of @xmath24 .",
    "thus we have the following basic extension of three important groups @xmath25    associated to each of these groups , we have various moduli spaces . namely the ( coarse ) moduli space @xmath12 of genus @xmath6 curves for @xmath2 , the moduli space @xmath26 of principally polarized abelian varieties for @xmath16 and the _ torelli space _ @xmath27 for @xmath14 . here",
    "the torelli space is defined to be the quotient of the teichmller space @xmath4 by the natural action of @xmath14 on it . since @xmath14 is known to be torsion free",
    ", @xmath27 is a complex manifold .",
    "we have holomorphic mappings between these moduli spaces @xmath28 where the first map is an infinite ramified covering and the second map is injective by the theorem of torelli .    by virtue of the above facts",
    ", we can investigate the structure of @xmath2 ( or that of @xmath12 ) by combining individual study of @xmath14 and @xmath16 ( or @xmath27 and @xmath26 ) together with some additional investigation of the action of @xmath16 on the structure of the torelli group or torelli space .",
    "here it turns out that the symplectic representation theory can play a crucial role .",
    "however , before reviewing them , let us first recall the fundamental works of d johnson on the structure of @xmath14 very briefly ( see @xcite for details ) because it is the starting point of the above method .",
    "johnson proved in @xcite that @xmath14 is finitely generated for all @xmath29 by constructing explicit generators for it . before this work ,",
    "a homomorphism @xmath30 was introduced in @xcite which generalized an earlier work of sullivan @xcite extensively and is now called the johnson homomorphism . here",

    "craggs homomorphisms defined in @xcite .",
    "the target of the latter homomorphisms are @xmath41 so that the first rational homology group of @xmath14 ( or more precisely , the abelianization of @xmath14 modulo 2 torsions ) is given simply by @xmath40 .",
    "namely we have an isomorphism @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "determine whether the torelli group @xmath44 is finitely presentable or not .",
    "if the answer is yes , give an explicit finite presentation of it .",
    "[ prob : torelli ]    it should be mentioned here that hain @xcite proved that the torelli lie algebra @xmath45 , which is the malcev lie algebra of @xmath14 , is finitely presentable for all @xmath29 .",
    "moreover he gave an explicit finite presentation of @xmath45 for any @xmath46 which turns out to be very simple , namely there arise only quadratic relations . here a result of kabanov @xcite played an important role in bounding the degrees of relations .",
    "more detailed description of this work as well as related materials will be given in  5 .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of @xmath47 , mess @xcite proved that @xmath48 is an infinitely generated free group .",
    "thus we can ask    ( i)determine whether the group @xmath37 is finitely generated or not for @xmath29 .",
    "( ii)determine the abelianization @xmath49 of @xmath37 .",
    "[ prob : k ]    we mention that @xmath37 is far from being a free group for @xmath29 .",
    "this is almost clear because it is easy to construct subgroups of @xmath37 which are free abelian groups of high ranks by making use of dehn twists along mutually disjoint separating simple closed curves on @xmath0 .",
    "more strongly , we can show , roughly as follows , that the cohomological dimension of @xmath37 will become arbitrarily large if we take the genus @xmath6 sufficiently large .",
    "let @xmath50 be the second johnson homomorphism given in @xcite ( see  5 below for notation ) .",
    "then it can be shown that the associated homomorphism @xmath51 is non - trivial by evaluating cohomology classes coming from @xmath52 , under the homomorphism @xmath53 , on abelian cycles of @xmath37 which are supported in the above free abelian subgroups .    in  6.6",
    ", we will consider the cohomological structure of the group @xmath37 from a hopefully deeper point of view which is related to the secondary characteristic classes of surface bundles introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath54 be the universal family of stable curves over the deligne ",
    "mumford compactification of the moduli space @xmath12 . in @xcite ,",
    "mumford defined certain classes @xmath55 in the chow algebra ( with coefficients in @xmath56 ) of the moduli space @xmath57 by setting @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the relative dualizing sheaf of the morphism @xmath60 . on the other hand , in @xcite the author",

    "the difference in signs comes from the fact that mumford uses the first chern class of the relative dualizing sheaf of @xmath60 while our definition uses the euler class of the relative tangent bundle .",
    "these classes @xmath67 are called tautological classes or mumford  morita  miller classes .    in this paper",
    ", we use our notation @xmath68 to emphasize that we consider it as an integral cohomology class of the mapping class group rather than an element of the chow algebra of the moduli space .",
    "a recent work of kawazumi and uemura in @xcite shows that the integral class @xmath68 can play an interesting role in a study of certain cohomological properties of finite subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath69\\lra \\lim_{g\\to\\infty } h^*(\\mg;\\bq ) \\label{3}\\ ] ]    be the natural homomorphism from the polynomial algebra generated by @xmath68 into the stable cohomology group of the mapping class group which exists by virtue of a fundamental result of harer @xcite .",
    "it was proved by miller @xcite and the author @xcite , independently , that the homomorphism @xmath70 is _ injective _ and we have the following well known conjecture ( see mumford @xcite ) .",
    "the homomorphism @xmath70 is an isomorphism so that @xmath71.\\ ] ] [ conj : basic ]    we would like to mention here a few pieces of evidence which support the above conjecture .",
    "first of all , harer s explicit computations in @xcite verify the conjecture in low degrees .",
    "see also @xcite for more recent development .",
    "secondly , kawazumi has shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the mumford  morita ",
    "miller classes occur naturally in his algebraic model of the cohomology of the moduli space which is constructed in the framework of the complex analytic gelfand  fuks cohomology theory , whereas no other classes can be obtained in this way .",
    "thirdly , in @xcite kawazumi and the author showed that the image of the natural homomorphism @xmath72 is exactly equal to the subalgebra generated by the classes @xmath68 ( see  6.4 for more detailed survey of related works ) . here",
    "@xmath17 stands for @xmath16 . finally ,",
    "as is explained in a survey paper by hain and looijenga @xcite and also in our paper @xcite , a combination of this result with hain s fundamental work in @xcite via looijenga s idea to use pikaart s purity theorem in @xcite implies that there are no new classes in the continuous cohomology of @xmath2 , with respect to a certain natural filtration on it , in the stable range .",
    "now there seems to be a rather canonical way of realizing the homomorphism @xmath70 of at the space level . to describe this",
    ", we first recall the cohomological nature of the classical representation @xmath73 .",
    "the siegel modular group @xmath16 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath74 and the maximal compact subgroup of the latter group is isomorphic to the unitary group @xmath75 .",
    "hence there exists a universal @xmath6dimensional complex vector bundle on the classifying space of @xmath16 .",

    "( see also @xcite ) , the dual bundle @xmath77 can be identified , on each family @xmath78 of riemann surfaces , as follows .",
    "namely it is the vector bundle over the base space @xmath79 whose fiber on @xmath80 is the space of holomorphic differentials on the riemann surface @xmath81 . in the above paper",
    ", atiyah used the grothendieck riemann ",

    "mumford compactification @xmath57 ) which is called the hodge bundle . in @xcite , mumford applied the grothendieck riemann ",
    "roch theorem to the morphism @xmath84 and obtained an identity , in the chow algebra @xmath85 , which expresses the chern classes of the hodge bundle in terms of the tautological classes @xmath86 with _ odd _ indices together with some canonical classes coming from the boundary . from this identity",
    ", we can deduce the relations @xmath87    in the rational cohomology of @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath88 denotes the @xmath89-th bernoulli number and @xmath90 is the characteristic class of @xmath77 corresponding to the formal sum @xmath91 ( sometimes called the @xmath92-th newton class ) .",
    "we have also obtained the above relations in @xcite by applying the atiyah ",
    "singer index theorem @xcite for families of elliptic operators , along the lines of atiyah s argument in @xcite . since @xmath77 is _ flat _ as a real vector bundle ,",
    "all of its pontrjagin classes vanish so that we can conclude that the chern classes of @xmath77 can be expressed entirely in terms of the classes @xmath93 .",
    "thus we can say that the totality of the classes @xmath93 of _ odd _ indices is equivalent to the total chern class of the hodge bundle which comes from the siegel modular group .",
    "although the rational cohomology of @xmath2 and @xmath12 are canonically isomorphic to each other , there seems to be a big difference between the torsion cohomology of them . to be more precise , let @xmath94 be the natural mapping which is uniquely defined up to homotopy , where the equality above is due to a result of earle and eells @xcite as was already mentioned in the introduction . as is well known ( see eg @xcite ) , @xmath2 is perfect for all @xmath29 so that we can apply quillen s plus construction on @xmath10 to obtain a simply connected space @xmath95 which has the same homology as that of @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that the moduli space @xmath12 is simply connected .",
    "hence , by the universal property of the plus construction , the above mapping factors through a mapping @xmath96    study the homotopy theoretical properties of the above mapping @xmath97 .",
    "in particular , what is its homotopy fiber ?",
    "the classical representation @xmath73 induces a mapping @xmath98    because @xmath16 is also perfect for @xmath29 .",
    "homotopy theoretical properties of this map ( or rather its direct limit as @xmath99 ) have been studied by many authors and they produced interesting implications on the torsion cohomology of @xmath2 ( see @xcite as well as their references ) . a final result along these lines",
    "was obtained by tillmann .",
    "this says that @xmath100 is an infinite loop space and the natural map @xmath101 is that of infinite loop spaces ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "see also @xcite for a different feature of the above map , @xcite for a homotopy theoretical implication of conjecture [ conj : basic ] and @xcite for the _ etale _ homotopy type of the moduli spaces .",
    "let @xmath102 be the homotopy fiber of the above mapping .",
    "then , we have a map @xmath103 using the fact that any class @xmath68 is primitive with respect to miller s loop space structure on @xmath104 , it is easy to see that the natural homomorphism @xmath105\\lra h^*(f_g;\\bq)\\ ] ] is _ injective _ in a certain stable range and we can ask how these cohomology classes behave on the torelli space .    we would like to show that the classes @xmath106 of _ even _ indices are closely related to the pontrjagin classes of the moduli space @xmath12 and also of the torelli space @xmath27 . to see this , recall that @xmath27 is a complex manifold and @xmath12 is _ nearly _ a complex manifold of dimension @xmath107 .",
    "more precisely , as is well known it has a finite ramified covering @xmath108 which is a complex manifold and we can write @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a suitable finite group acting holomorphically on @xmath108 . hence we have the chern classes @xmath111 of the tangent bundle of @xmath108 which is invariant under the action of @xmath110 .",
    "hence we have the rational cohomology classes @xmath112 which is easily seen to be independent of the choice of @xmath108 .",
    "we may call them _ orbifold _ chern classes of the moduli space . to identify these classes",
    ", we use the grothendieck riemann ",
    "roch theorem applied to the morphism @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the relative tangent bundle ( in the orbifold sense ) of @xmath60 and @xmath116 is a vector bundle over @xmath117 .",
    "if we take @xmath116 to be the relative cotangent bundle @xmath59 as in @xcite , then we obtain the relations above . instead of this ,",
    "let us take @xmath116 to be @xmath115 . since @xmath118 by the kodaira  spencer theory , we have @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the euler class of @xmath115 .",
    "from this , we can conclude    @xmath121    the first few classes are given by @xmath122    thus the orbifold chern classes of @xmath12 turn out to be , in some sense , independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the pull back of these classes to the torelli space @xmath27 are equal to the ( genuine ) chern classes of it because @xmath27 is a complex manifold .",
    "since the pull back of @xmath93 to @xmath27 vanishes for all @xmath92 , we can conclude that @xmath123 and only the classes @xmath124 may remain to be non - trivial .",
    "as is well known , these classes are equivalent to the pontrjagin classes of @xmath27 as a differentiable manifold .    in view of the above facts",
    ", it may be said that the classifying map @xmath125 of the holomorphic tangent bundle of @xmath12 would realize the conjectural isomorphism at the space level ( rigorously speaking , we have to use some finite covering of @xmath12 ) .",
    "alternatively we could use the map @xmath126 where the second factor is the classifying map of the tangent bundle of @xmath12 as a _ real _ vector bundle . in short",
    ", we can say that the odd classes @xmath93 serve as chern classes of the hodge bundle while the even classes @xmath106 embody the orbifold pontrjagin classes of the moduli space .",
    "according to looijenga @xcite , the deligne ",
    "mumford compactification @xmath57 can also be described as a finite quotient of some compact complex manifold .",
    "hence we have its orbifold chern classes as well as orbifold pontrjagin classes . on the other hand , since @xmath57 is a rational homology manifold , its combinatorial pontrjagin classes in the sense of thom are defined .",

    "in particular , study the relation between the corresponding charateristic numbers .",
    "if we look at the basic extension given in  2 , keeping in mind the above discussions together with the borel vanishing theorem given in @xcite concerning the triviality of twisted cohomology of @xmath16 with coefficients in non - trivial algebraic representations of @xmath127 , we arrive at the following conjecture .    any class @xmath106 of even index is non - trivial in the rational cohomology of the torelli group @xmath14 for sifficiently large @xmath6 .",

    "he compares the orbifold euler characteristic of @xmath12 given by harer ",
    "zagier in @xcite with that of @xmath26 given by harder @xcite to conclude that the euler number of @xmath27 , if defined , can not be an integer because the latter number is much larger than the former one .",
    "on the other hand , it seems to be extremely difficult to construct a family of riemann surfaces such that its monodromy does not act on the homology of the fiber wheras the moduli moves in such a way that the classes @xmath106 are non - trivial ( see a recent result of i smith described in @xcite for example ) .",
    "perhaps completely different approaches to this problem along the lines of works of jekel @xcite or klein @xcite might also be possible .",
    "as was explained in  2 , it is an important method of studying the structure of the mapping class group to combine those of the siegel modular group @xmath16 and the torelli group @xmath14 together with the action of the former group on the structure of the latter group .",
    "more precisely , there arise various representations of the algebraic group @xmath127 in the study of @xmath2 . for example",
    ", the rational homology group @xmath133 of the surface @xmath0 is the fundamental representation of @xmath127 and johnson s result implies that @xmath134 is also a rational representation of it .",
    "hereafter , the representation @xmath135 will be denoted by @xmath136 .",
    "thus the classical representation theory of @xmath127 can play crucial roles .    on the other hand ,",

    "equivalent statement can be given for the associated lie algebras @xmath468 .",
    "the second result is the explicit presentation of the torelli lie algebra @xmath436 .",
    "let @xmath469 and let @xmath136 be @xmath470 as before .",

    "2]+[2 ^ 2]+[0]\\ ] ] where the decomposition of @xmath475 is valid for @xmath476 .",
    "the fact that @xmath477+[0]$ ] is contained in the kernel was essentially proved in our papers @xcite , though in a more primitive way . in fact , we obtained the secondary invariant @xmath478 ( see  6.6 below for details ) from the vanishing of the trivial summand @xmath479 $ ] in @xmath480 which turned out to be closely related to the casson invariant .",
    "hain proved the above result in a systematic way .",
    "in particular , the non - triviality in @xmath481 of other summands than @xmath477+[0]$ ] was shown by constructing explicit abelian cycles of @xmath14 on which they take non - zero values .    if @xmath29 , then @xmath45 is isomorphic to the completion of its associated graded lie algebra @xmath482 .",
    "moreover if @xmath476 , then it has a presentation @xmath483+[1 ^ 4]+[1 ^ 2]+[2 ^ 21 ^ 2])\\ ] ] where @xmath484 denotes the free lie algebra generated by @xmath485 $ ]",
    ".    hain obtained similar presentations for other lie algebras @xmath486 as well .",
    "although these presentations are very simple , the proof requires deep and powerful techniques in hodge theory .",
    "one of the main ingredients is to put mixed hodge structures on @xmath487 and then on @xmath45 which depend on a fixed complex structure on the reference surface .",
    "one important consequence of this is that after tensoring with @xmath488 , they are canonically isomorphic to their associated graded lie algebras .",

    "more precisely , we consider the following topics .",
    "we consider the structure of the graded lie algebra @xmath498 ( see  5 ) .",
    "recall that this is the graded lie algebra consisting of derivations , with positive degrees , of the free graded lie algebra @xmath276 which kill the symplectic class @xmath499 .",
    "we omit the degree 0 part @xmath500 which is isomorphic to @xmath501 .",
    "as was explained in  5 , this lie algebra serves as the target of the johnson homomorphisms @xmath502 so that the main problem is to describe the image @xmath503 as a lie subalgebra of @xmath275 .",
    "it is one of the basic results of johnson that @xmath504 here we mention two important topological applications obtained by hain in his fundamental work in @xcite .",
    "one is that the graded lie algebra @xmath505 ( the superscript @xmath56 will mean that we take the operation @xmath506 as before ) is generated by the degree one summand @xmath507 , which was already mentioned in  5 . the other is that the natural map @xmath508 is surjective after tensoring with @xmath56 ( and hence is an isomorphism for @xmath509 ) .",
    "as is mentioned in @xcite , this is an answer to a problem raised by asada ",

    "we can also show that it vanishes on the ideal @xmath515 .",

    "the ideal @xmath515 and the image @xmath514 of the johnson homomorphism are almost disjoint from each other and both are contained in the kernel of the traces .",
    "thus the next problem is to determine how large is the remaining part of the lie algebra @xmath275 .",
    "after we had found the traces , nakamura @xcite discovered another obstruction to the surjectivity of @xmath524 which has its origin in number theory .",
    "more precisely , it is related to theories of outer galois representations of the absolute galois group over @xmath56 initiated by grothendieck , ihara and deligne and developed by many people ( see @xcite and references in them ) .",
    "roughly speaking , nakamura proved that certain graded lie algebra , which arises in the above theories , appears in the cokernel of johnson homomorphisms .",
    "in particular , he concluded that the dimension of the cokernel of the johnson homomorphism @xmath525 is greater than or equal to a number @xmath526 which is the free @xmath527rank of a certain galois group @xmath528 associated to the outer representation of @xmath529 on some nilpotent quotient of the pro-@xmath530 fundamental group of @xmath531 ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "hence any invariant of @xmath224manifolds naturally has certain effect on the structure of the mapping class group .    until the discovery of the casson invariant for homology @xmath224spheres in @xmath601 , the rohlin invariant was almost the unique invariant for @xmath224manifolds .",
    "motivated mainly by witten s influential work in @xcite , the theory of topological invariants of @xmath224manifolds has been continually and rapidly developing .",

    "this work has been generalized in two different ways .",
    "one is due to lescop @xcite where she obtained , among other things , a closed formula which expresses how the casson  walker ",

    "hence if problem [ prob : kernel ] will be affirmatively solved , it would imply that the finite type invariants can be described in terms of the original casson invariant together with the massey products .",
    "this might sound unlikely from the point of view of @xmath224manifolds invariants .",
    "also the author learned from j murakami that the restriction , to the torelli group , of the projective representation of @xmath2 associated to the lmo invariant given in @xcite gives rise to a unipotent representation ( after suitable truncations ) .",

    "let us consider the direct limit @xmath713 it is easy to see that the johnson homomorphism @xmath714 and the traces @xmath715 are all compatible with respect to the inclusions @xmath716 . namely the following diagram is commutative @xmath717 where @xmath703 denotes the module @xmath18 corresponding to the genus @xmath6 .",
    "in view of the explicit computations in low degrees we have done so far , it seems to be reasonable to make the following conjecture .",
    "the abelianization of the lie algebra @xmath410 is given by @xmath714 and the traces , so that we have an isomorphism @xmath718\\cong   \\la^3 h_\\bq\\oplus \\bigl(\\bigoplus_{k\\geq 1 } s^{2k+1 } h_\\bq\\bigr).\\ ] ] a similar statement is true for @xmath418 .",
    "[ conj : abel ]    if this conjecture were true , then any element in @xmath410 , including the galois obstructions , can be described by taking brackets of suitable elements of @xmath719 and @xmath720 . regardless of whether the above conjecture is true or not",
    ", we have a homomorphism @xmath721 where @xmath722 denotes the continuous cohomology , in the usual sense ( cf @xcite ) , of graded lie algebras which are infinite dimensional but each degree @xmath149 summand is finite dimensional for all @xmath149 . the @xmath17invariant part of the above homomorphism can be written as @xmath723 where @xmath724 denotes the inverse limit of the @xmath17invariant part of the continuous cohomology of the graded lie algebras @xmath410 which stabilizes .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath410 contains @xmath550 as a natural lie subalgebra and by restriction and passing to the limit , we obtain a series of homomorphisms @xmath725    here @xmath726 and the second isomorphism is due to hain @xcite where he showed that @xmath727 has a mixed hodge structure ( depending on a fixed complex structure on the reference surface ) so that there is a canonical isomorphism of @xmath727 with @xmath728 after tensoring with @xmath488 . for the last homomorphism ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "since @xmath715 is trivial on @xmath729 for any @xmath149 ( see @xcite ) , the composition of with is trivial on any @xmath17invariant which contains the trace component @xmath730 .",
    "hence , the _ moduli part _ of the homomorphism is given by @xmath731 as was explained in @xcite ( see also  2 ) , a combination of our result @xcite with that of @xcite implies that the image of the above homomorphism can be identified with the polynomial algebra @xmath732\\subset \\lim_{g\\to\\infty } h^*(\\m1g;\\bq).\\ ] ] then it is a natural question to ask the geometric meaning of the remaining part of the homomorphism .",
    "this can be answered by invoking important work of kontsevich @xcite , which we now briefly review .    as was mentioned in  5 , our @xmath418 is the degree positive part of his lie algebra @xmath417 described in the above cited papers .",
    "the homology group @xmath733 has a natural structure of a commutative and cocommutative hopf algebra , where the multiplication comes from the sum operation @xmath734 .",
    "also it can be decomposed as @xmath735 by making use of his theory of graph cohomology together with a result of culler ",
    "vogtmann @xcite , he proved the following remarkable theorem .",
    "there exists an isomorphism @xmath736 where @xmath737 denotes the primitive part of the @xmath149dimensional homology and @xmath419 denotes the outer automorphism group of the free group of rank @xmath738 .",
    "more precisely , for each even degree @xmath739 with respect to the grading of @xmath417 , there exists an isomorphism @xmath740 passing to the dual , we also have an isomorphism @xmath741 [ thm : kontsevich ]    let us observe here that if conjecture [ conj : abel ] were true , then @xmath742 so that we can conclude @xmath743 for any @xmath421 by the above theorem of kontsevich .",
    "we have checked that this is the case up to @xmath744 .",
    "we mention that culler ",
    "vogtmann proved , in the above paper , that the virtual cohomological dimension of @xmath419 is equal to @xmath745 .",
    "it is easy to see that the irreducible decomposition of the module @xmath750 $ ] is given by @xmath751+[4]+[3 ^ 2]+[2 ^ 2]+[1 ^ 2]+[0].\\ ] ] then the result follows from rather long explicit computations , in the framework of symplectic representation theory , of the lie bracket @xmath572\\ra { \\mathfrak h}^\\bq_{g,1}(6)$ ] .    recall that similar homomorphism @xmath752 has a big kernel ( hain @xcite , see also @xcite for the case of one boundary component ) .",
    "thus we find that the behaviour of the trace component is fairly different from that of the moduli part .",
    "in particular , the pull back of any class in @xmath753 to the subalgebra of @xmath410 generated by @xmath747 is trivial .",
    "however if we consider the interaction of the trace component with the moduli part , the situation changes .",
    "in fact , we obtain the following result .      by proposition [ prop : la2 ] , there is a chain @xmath756 such that @xmath757 and @xmath758 is a non - zero element of @xmath551 . on the other hand",
    ", explicit computation shows that there is a chain @xmath759 such that @xmath760 and @xmath761 .",
    "we can arrange the above elements so that the @xmath699cycle @xmath762 is in fact an @xmath17invariant one .",
    "thus it defines an element of @xmath763 on which the cohomology class in question takes a non - zero value .",
    "the primitivity follows from the property of the trace .",
    "if we combine the above result with thoerem [ thm : kontsevich ] , we can conclude the non - triviality of @xmath549 .",
    "this seems to be consistent with a recent result of hatcher ",
    "vogtmann @xcite in which they proved that @xmath764 ( vogtmann informed us that she obtained an isomorphism @xmath765 by a computer calculation ) .",
    "if we use higher traces @xmath715 in the above consideration , we obtain infinitely many classes in @xmath755 and these in turn give rise to a series of certain homology classes in @xmath766 it seems highly likely that all of these classes are non - trivial . also by combining various trace components as well as the moduli part at the same time",
    ", we can define many primitive ( co)homology classes of the lie algebra @xmath417 .",
    "chern classes and pontrjagin classes are representatives of characteristic classes of vector bundles and they play fundamental roles in diverse branches of mathematics",
    ". we may call these classes _ primary _ characteristic classes . in some cases where these primary classes vanish , there arise various theories of so - called _ secondary _ characteristic classes . for example",
    ", we have the theory of characteristic classes of foliations , characteristic classes of flat bundles , the theory of chern and simons and also that of cheeger and simons and so on .    in the case of surface bundles ,",
    "it is natural to call the classes @xmath68 the primary characteristic classes . as was mentioned in  3 , the odd classes @xmath93 come from the siegel modular group @xmath16 via the classical representation @xmath767 .",
    "hence these classes ( with rational coefficients ) vanish on the torelli group @xmath14 .",
    "it is a fundamental question concerning the cohomology of @xmath14 whether even classes @xmath106 are non - trivial on it or not ( see conjecture 3.4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it was proved in @xcite that any class @xmath68 , including the cases of even @xmath92 , vanish on the subgroup @xmath37 of the mapping class group @xmath2 , which is the subgroup generated by all dehn twists along _ separating _ simple closed curves on @xmath0 ( see  2 ) .",
    "the proof of this fact goes roughly as follows .",
    "as was recalled in  6.4 , in our paper @xcite we have constructed certain natural cocycles for @xmath68 and by the very definition they vanish on @xmath37 .",
    "thus there are _ two _ reasons with different sources that the odd classes @xmath93 vanish on @xmath37 .    by making use of this fact , we can define the _ secondary _ characteristic classes of surface bundles .",
    "one way to do so can be described as follows . for each @xmath93 , choose two cocycles @xmath768 both of which represent @xmath93 such that @xmath769 comes from the siegel modular group while @xmath770 is a cocycle constructed in @xcite using the linear representation @xmath646 described there .",
    "since these two cocycles are cohomologous to each other , there exists a cochain @xmath771 such that @xmath772 .",
    "now both of @xmath768 are 0 on @xmath37 so that if we restrict @xmath773 to @xmath37 , it is a cocycle . hence we can define a cohomology class @xmath774 to be the class of the cocycle @xmath775 . it can be shown that the cohomology class of @xmath776 $ ] does not depend on the choices of the cocycles @xmath768 modulo the indeterminacy @xmath777 we remark that if conjecture [ conj : basic ] were true , then the above indeterminacy vanishes , at least in the stable range , so that @xmath778 would be uniquely defined .",
    "we know that the first one @xmath779 can be defined uniquely . here",
    "we describe the precise formula for it .",
    "let @xmath780 be meyer s signature cocyle given in @xcite which is in fact defined on @xmath16 .",
    "it represents @xmath781 . on the other hand in @xcite we gave another cocycle for @xmath782 .",
    "more precisely , in the notation of  6.4 the cocycle @xmath783 represents @xmath782 ( see @xcite for an interpretation of this result as well as others from the point of view of algebraic geometry ) . here",
    "@xmath784 is the trivalent graph which has @xmath699 vertices and @xmath699 loops while @xmath785 is the trivalent graph with @xmath699 vertices and without loops ( namely the _ theta _ graph ) .",
    "the above two cocycles are cohomologous to each other so that there exists a mapping @xmath786 such that @xmath787 .",
    "since @xmath2 is perfect for @xmath29 and @xmath788 , the above map @xmath789 is uniquely defined . also since the restriction of both of @xmath40 and @xmath770 to the subgroup @xmath37 is trivial ,",
    "we obtain a homomorphism @xmath790 this is the definition of our secondary class @xmath478 .",
    "let @xmath791 be a dehn twist along a separating simple closed curve on @xmath0 such that it divides @xmath0 into two compact surfaces of genus @xmath792 and @xmath793 .",
    "then the value of the secondary class @xmath478 on it is given by @xmath794 moreover @xmath789 is the generator of @xmath795 for all @xmath1 .    in our paper @xcite , the coefficient of @xmath796 in the above formula for @xmath797 was not mentioned .",
    "however it is easy to deduce it from the results obtained there . in @xcite",
    "we gave an interpretation of @xmath789 in terms of hirzebruch s signature defect of certain framed 3manifolds .",
    "generalizing this , we obtained another more geometrical definition of higher secondary classes @xmath798 .",
    "we expect that these two definitions of @xmath778 would coincide for all @xmath92 .",
    "hain informed us the following interesting facts . in the above theorem",
    ", the number @xmath796 appeared in relation to the dehn twist @xmath386 .",
    "about the same time , the same number appeared in the works of jorgenson @xcite and wentworth @xcite .",
    "in fact , it plays the role of the principal factor in their asymptotic formula of faltings delta function around the divisor @xmath799 , which is associated to @xmath386 , of the deligne ",
    "mumford compactification @xmath57 .",
    "this number plays one more important role also in a recent work of moriwaki @xcite where he obtained a certain inequality related to the cone of positive divisors on @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , hain has an interpretation that these phenomena are more than just a coincidence .",
    "kawazumi is also trying to develop a theory related to @xmath789 . from the topological point of view",
    ", we may say that they are the manifestation of the casson invariant in the geometry of the moduli space of curves .",
    "we expect that there should exist very rich structures here which deserve future investigations",
    ".      there has been rapid progress in the theory of the moduli space @xmath57 related to the primary charactersitic classes @xmath659 or @xmath68 , namely from the celebrated works of witten @xcite and kontsevich @xcite to the recent developments reaching to the gromov ",
    "witten invariants ( see @xcite and references in them ) .",
    "in contrast with this , the secondary classes @xmath778 seem to be beyond the reach of any explicit study at present , except for the first one . in relation to the first class @xmath789 , it seems to be a challenging problem to try to generalize the genus one story given in atiyah s paper @xcite to the cases of higher genera in various ways .",
    "we believe that the higher classes @xmath778 will also eventually play an important role in hopefully deeper geometrical study of the moduli space .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the mapping class group from the viewpoint of gromov s bounded cohomology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recall that the bounded cohomology ( with coefficients in @xmath802 ) of a group @xmath233 , denoted by @xmath803 , is defined to be the cohomology of the subcomplex of the ordinary @xmath802valued cochain complex @xmath804 consisting of all cochains @xmath805 which are bounded as functions .",
    "we have a natural homomorphism @xmath806 and it reflects algebraic as well as geometric properties of the group @xmath233 rather closely .",
    "for example if @xmath233 is amenable , then @xmath803 is trivial in positive degrees while if @xmath233 is the fundamental group of a closed negatively curved manifold , then the above map ( except for degree one part ) is known to be surjective by an argument due to thurston ( see @xcite ) .      in particular",
    ", we may ask whether the characteristic class @xmath808 can be represented by a bounded cocycle or not .",
    "it was remarked in @xcite that gromov s general result in @xcite implies that any odd class @xmath93 can be represented by a bounded cocycle .",
    "this is because , as mentioned in  3 , these classes are pull backs of some classical characteristic classes of @xmath16 which is a discrete subgroup of @xmath74 .",
    "it seems to be natural to conjecture that even classes @xmath106 can also be represented by bounded cocycles .",
    "one evidence for this was given in @xcite where we proved that any surface bundle with amenable monodromy group has trivial characteristic classes as it should be if @xmath68 were all bounded cohomology classes .",
    "meyer s signature cocycle given in @xcite is an explicit bounded cocycle which represents @xmath809 ( see @xcite ) but no other explicit bounded cocycle has been constructed for higher odd classes .",
    "we mention here that the cocycles for @xmath68 constructed in @xcite using trivalent graphs are far from being bounded .",
    "the particular case of degree 2 , namely the map @xmath811 already deserves further investigation . harer s determination of @xmath812 in @xcite together with meyer s result @xcite mentioned above implies that the above map is surjective . if @xmath588 , then @xmath813 so that @xmath814 while it is well known that @xmath815 is infinite dimensional . if @xmath47 , then we know that @xmath816 because @xmath817 is contractible by a result of igusa @xcite .",
    "we consider the cochain @xmath819 described in  6.6 . if @xmath47 , then @xmath820",
    "so that @xmath821 where @xmath822 is meyer s signature 2cocycle for the genus 2 mapping class group . since @xmath823 , @xmath789 is uniquely determined by the above equality .",
    "observe that @xmath789 is not a bounded cochain because @xmath824 is a non - trivial homomorphism .",
    "we can now conclude that the bounded cohomology class @xmath825\\in h^2_b({\\cal m}_2)$ ] is non - trivial .",
    "meyer s signature cocycle has been investigated from various points of view , see work of y. matsumoto @xcite for the case of @xmath47 , endo @xcite and morifuji @xcite for the cases of hyperelliptic mapping class groups and morifuji @xcite and kasagawa @xcite for certain geometric aspects of it .",
    "epstein and fujiwara @xcite proved that the second bounded cohomology of any gromov hyperbolic group is infinite dimensional .",
    "although the mapping class group is not a gromov hyperbolic group , because it contains many free abelian subgroup of rather high ranks , it was proved by tromba @xcite and wolpert @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the sectional curvature of the teichmller space with respect to the weil ",
    "petersson metric is negative .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that if @xmath233 is a uniformly perfect group , then the mapping @xmath829 is injective .",
    "hence if the former part of conjecture [ conj : bounded ] were true , then conjecture [ conj : uniform ] is also true . in the case of @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath830 is not perfect .",
    "however it is also known that its abelianization is finite , namely we have @xmath831 .",
    "the following result is a companion of proposition [ prop : m2 ] .          in this subsection , we consider various representations of the mapping class group .",
    "first we mention the magnus representation of the torelli group .",

    "it is easy to see that this mapping is injective .",
    "however it is not a homomorphism in the usual sense but is rather a crossed homomorphism . to obtain a genuine homomorphism",
    ", we have to restrict this mapping to the torelli group @xmath836 and reduce the coefficients to @xmath837 $ ] which is induced by the abelianization @xmath838 .",

    "the augmentation ideal of @xmath837 $ ] induces a filtration of @xmath449 .",
    "it is easy to see that this filtration is strictly coarser than @xmath842 which was described in  5",
