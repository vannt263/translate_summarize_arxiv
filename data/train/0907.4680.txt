    "@xcite , we perform 3- and 4-node motif detection on the transcriptional regulatory networks of _ e. coli _ ( version @xmath0 ) and _ s. cerevisiae _ , using their freely available network data and software ( mfinder version @xmath1 ) @xcite .    generation of randomized networks from the actual network is performed according to one of three null models : an edge - swapping algorithm , an edge - matching algorithm , and a monte carlo algorithm , all described in detail in @xcite . because significance results are similar among models ( cf .",
    "_ results _ and @xcite ) , emphasis in this note is placed on the edge - swapping algorithm , a markov chain procedure that repeatedly swaps the target nodes between pairs of edges .",

    "mutual information captures correlation between two random variables even when a relationship exists that is nonlinear ( unlike , e.g. , the correlation coefficient ) or non - monotonic ( unlike , e.g. , spearman s rho ) . in this study , the counts @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the @xmath5th and @xmath6th subgraphs at each iteration of the edge - swapping process are used to increment a counts matrix from which the joint probability distribution @xmath7 is obtained by normalization . mutual information @xmath8 is computed as @xmath9 where the log is base 2 to give @xmath8 in bits , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "mutual information is bounded from below by @xmath12 ( as seen in eqn .",
    "[ i ] when there is no correlation and the subgraph counts are independent of each other i.e.  @xmath13 ) and bounded from above by the smaller of the two variables entropies , where @xmath14 and the analogous expression with @xmath15 are the entropies of the @xmath5th and @xmath6th subgraphs counts respectively . in order to obtain a statistic that can be compared across all subgraph pairs ,",
    "we normalize by the average entropy , defining @xmath16 as our measure of correlation .",

    "only four 3-node subgraphs are present in the transcriptional network of _",
    "e. coli _ , and a @xmath2-score analysis of the type performed in @xcite reveals a curious effect .",
    "specifically , with respect to ensembles generated via any of the edge - swapping , edge - matching , and monte carlo algorithms @xcite , the @xmath2-scores of three of the subgraphs ( ids 6 , 12 , and 36 ; cf .",

    "in fact , as shown in fig .  [ overlap ] , the absolute value of the difference in counts within the actual network and counts within a sample randomized network at each iteration of the edge - swapping algorithm is the same among all four subgraphs for the first 1,000 iterations .",
    "the interpretation is simple : as detailed in fig .",
    "[ toy ] , each time an edge of a feed - forward loop is swapped with an external edge , the feed - forward loop is destroyed and one of each of the other three subgraphs is created ; using subgraph ids we may denote this process as @xmath22 since this process accounts for the overwhelming majority of the changes in count of the latter three subgraphs , there is extremely high correlation among the counts of all four subgraphs in each randomized network , and the magnitudes of their @xmath2-scores are very close .    -scores are calculated with respect to an ensemble of 1,000 randomized networks , generated via the edge - swapping algorithm @xcite .",

    "[ mi3]-[mi4 ] show the matrices @xmath24 ; the row and column order is determined by summing along either direction and sorting , which tends to group together sets of subgraphs with high pairwise correlations .    during randomization of the _ e. coli _ network , a set of four 3-node subgraphs ( ids 6 , 12 , 36 , and 38 ; cf .",
    "[ dict ] ) are highly correlated , as shown by the bright 4-by-4 square in fig .",
    "the high correlation is simply the result of the effect described in the previous section , in which any of three swaps overwhelmingly converts a feed - forward loop ( i d 38 ) into three other subgraphs ( ids 6 , 12 , and 36 ) .",

    "these correlations are due to the effects ( in the notation of eqn .",
    "[ eff1 ] ) @xmath25 of which one may convince oneself with the aid of fig .",
    "note that although subgraphs 14 , 102 and 108 participate in the highly correlated effects described here , none changes in number significantly enough upon randomization to be labeled a motif in the _ s. cerevisiae _ network ( subgraphs 46 and 74 do not appear in the actual network , only during the course of the randomization ) .",
    "our analysis reveals correlations between counts of 4-node subgraphs as well . as indicated by the bright blocks and off - diagonal elements in fig .",
    "[ mi4 ] , several sets of subgraphs are highly correlated during the randomization of both the _ e. coli _ and _ s. cerevisiae _ networks .",
    "correlations are less easily interpreted in the 4-node case than in the 3-node case , but one must nonetheless remain aware of such artifacts of the randomization process when identifying subgraphs as motifs .",
    "we note that the bi - fan ( i d 204 ) , the 4-node subgraph commonly identified as a motif in a variety of networks including both transcriptional networks studied here @xcite , does not exhibit particularly high correlation with any other subgraph under our measure in either the _ e. coli _ or _ s. cerevisiae _ network .",
    "we find results qualitatively similar to figs .",

    "by quantifying correlations among subgraph counts during 3- and 4-node motif detection in the transcriptional networks of _ e. coli _ and _ s. cerevisiae _ , we reveal that motifs come in sets : the destruction of a subgraph during the randomization process can be highly correlated with the creation of one or more other subgraphs .",
    "the correlations are easily understood in the 3-node case , and we present an information - theoretic tool to extract such correlations in general .",
    "it has not escaped our attention that this observation serves as the basis for a more principled clustering of subgraphs based on correlations ( e.g. , by mixture - modeling in which the state of the subgraph count is a mixture of several states , with counts conditionally independent given the state ) .",
    "the correlations among subgraphs are artifacts of the algorithm used to generate the ensemble of randomized networks ; although we demonstrate their existence here in the context of only one randomization algorithm , the edge - swapping algorithm , they occur in other commonly used algorithms , as evidenced by mutually consistent effects on the @xmath2-scores .",
    "these findings do not necessarily invalidate the statuses of commonly identified motifs ( it remains the case , for example , that there are significantly more feed - forward loops in the transcriptional network of _",
    "e. coli _ than in a random network generated under most any commonly used null model ) ; they do argue , however , that the limitations of the randomization scheme should be fully recognized during the motif finding process ."
