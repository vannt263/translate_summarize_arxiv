    "particle physics models including weak - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) are amongst the most compelling candidates@xcite for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . of this class of models ,",
    "the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) stands out as at least the most popular framework for performing searches for susy , and can justifiably be called the paradigm model for weak scale supersymmetry@xcite .",
    "the msugra model can be characterized briefly by the following attributes@xcite :    * particle content and gauge symmetries of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , _ i.e. _ a supersymmetrized version of the two - higgs doublet sm , plus all allowed soft susy breaking terms , * a desert between the weak scale and the unification scale , which allows for gauge coupling unification , * universal boundary conditions for soft - susy breaking terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 implemented at the unification scale @xmath10 , * electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively , and is a consequence of the large top quark yukawa coupling .    the various weak scale parameters are related to gut scale parameters via renormalization group equations ( rge s ) .",
    "typically , all weak - scale sparticle masses and mixings are then determined by the parameter set @xmath11 along with the measured value of @xmath12 .",
    "we take @xmath13 gev throughout this paper .",
    "of course , not all values of the above parameter set are allowed .",
    "for some values , electroweak symmetry is not broken appropriately .",
    "for other values , a charged or colored sparticle may be the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , in conflict with cosmology and searches for exotic nuclei and atoms .",
    "in addition , there exist constraints from negative searches for sparticles at the fermilab tevatron @xmath14 and lep2 @xmath15 colliders .",
    "in particular , we note the recent bound that @xmath16 gev for a gaugino - like lightest chargino@xcite . additionally , in the absence of @xmath17-violating interactions , there exist bounds on parameter space from the relic density of neutralinos produced in the big bang@xcite ; for certain regions of parameter space , the neutralino relic density @xmath18 , which implies a universe younger than 10 billion years , in contradiction at least with the ages of the oldest stars in globular clusters .",
    "finally , several recent papers have mapped out regions of msugra parameter space where there exist vacua deeper than the standard minimum@xcite .",
    "these non - standard vacua constraints may not be rigorous , however , if one entertains the notion that the universe may have settled into a false vacuum .",
    "the parameter space of the msugra model ( as well as many other models@xcite ) may also be constrained by data from rare meson decays , such as the branching fraction for @xmath19 .",
    "a recent analysis by the cleo collaboration finds for the inclusive decays @xmath20 , with 95% cl upper and lower limits ( including systematic errors ) of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively@xcite .",
    "such data , when compared against theoretical predictions of @xmath0 , have been shown to be very restrictive for both two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm)@xcite and supersymmetric models@xcite . for a type ii 2hdm ,",
    "loop contributions involving the top quark and charged higgs @xmath23 add constructively with sm loops involving top and @xmath24 bosons . in the mssm ,",
    "there exist other contributions involving squark - chargino loops , squark - neutralino loops , and squark - gluino loops .",
    "the latter two contributions are much smaller than squark - chargino loop contributions , and are frequently neglected .",
    "the squark - chargino loop contribution can add either constructively or destructively with the @xmath24 and @xmath25 loops , leading to allowed or forbidden regions of susy model parameter space .",
    "these calculations are usually performed by evaluating lowest order matrix elements of effective theory operators at a scale @xmath26 .",
    "all orders approximate qcd corrections are included via renormalization group resummation of leading logs ( ll ) which arise due to a disparity between the scale at which new physics enters the @xmath0 loop corrections ( usually taken to be @xmath27 ) , and the scale at which the @xmath0 decay rate is evaluated ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the resummation is most easily performed within the framework of effective field theories . above the scale @xmath1 ( all scales @xmath27",
    "are equivalent in ll perturbation theory ) , calculations are performed within the full theory . below @xmath1 ,",
    "heavy particles are integrated out of the theory , leading to an effective hamiltonian @xmath28 where matching between the two theories occurs at @xmath1 and yields the values of @xmath29 . in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] , the @xmath30 are wilson coefficients evaluated at scale @xmath31 , and the @xmath32 are a complete set of operators , given , for example , in ref .",
    "resummation then occurs by solving the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) for the wilson coefficients @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 anomalous dimension matrix ( adm ) , and @xmath36 the matrix elements of the operators @xmath32 are finally calculated at a scale @xmath4 and multiplied by the appropriately evolved wilson coefficients to gain the final decay amplitude .    the ll qcd corrections just described yield enhancements in the @xmath0 decay rate of factors of @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the resulting ll calculation yields an answer which is ambiguous depending upon which precise scale choice is chosen for evaluation of matrix elements of the operators @xmath32 .",
    "variation of the scale @xmath38 yields approximately a 25% uncertainty in the theoretical calculation .",
    "this uncertainty provides the greatest source of error in currently available theoretical calculations@xcite . to reduce the theoretical uncertainty",
    ", one must proceed to a next - to - leading - log calculation ( nll ) of the @xmath0 decay rate .",
    "recently , a number of theoretical developments have been made towards the goal of a nll calculation of @xmath5 .",
    "cho and grinstein showed@xcite that if there are two significantly different masses contributing to the loop amplitude ( such as @xmath12 and @xmath39 ) , then in fact there can already exist significant corrections to the wilson coefficients at scale @xmath39 . in this case , one must create an effective theory by first integrating out the heavy top quark , apply rge running between the scales @xmath12 and @xmath39 , and then integrate out the @xmath24 boson to arrive at the operator set in [ eq2 ] .",
    "the above procedure gives a @xmath40 enhancement to the sm value of @xmath5 .",
    "in supersymmetric models , many more heavy particles are present .",
    "anlauf has shown how to perform a similar analysis for the case of the mssm@xcite .",

    "greub , hurth and wyler have reported results@xcite on the complete virtual corrections to the relevant operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 . combining these with the bremsstrahlung corrections@xcite results in cancellation of associated soft and collinear singularities . a combination of the qcd corrected operator matrix elements @xmath50 with the complete @xmath3 corrected wilson coefficients at scale @xmath4 will result in a nll calculation of the @xmath5 decay rate .    in this paper",
    ", we have nothing new to add to the calculational procedure for evaluating @xmath5 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to bring together the above pieces of a nll calculation of @xmath5 and to interface with the msugra model so that detailed comparisons to data can be made in parameter space . in so doing ,",
    "we simply neglect the missing piece of the calculation , @xmath47 .",
    "this will result in some small scheme dependence of our results , and in some additional scale dependence , so our calculation will not be truly nll . hence , we label it as qcd improved , in hope that @xmath47 turns out small , as preliminary reports suggest .",
    "our goal as well is to evaluate the @xmath5 rate as a function of msugra parameters and compare with the recent cleo results , to find favored or excluded regions of parameter space .",

    "in this section , we outline our procedure for calculating @xmath5 as a function of msugra parameter space .",
    "our first step of course is to input the parameter set [ eq1 ] and solve for the superparticle masses and mixings via running of the msugra rge equations between @xmath52 and @xmath53 and imposing the appropriate minimization criteria using the 1-loop corrected effective potential .",
    "we iterate the running back and forth between the two scales six times using the usual runge - kutta method ; this results in a convergent spectrum of superparticle masses .",
    "the procedure is described more fully in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the last run down but one ,",
    "we take note of the various superparticle masses . on the final run from @xmath53 to @xmath52",

    "the procedure of anlauf is as follows .",
    "first , at scale @xmath60 , the heavy particle is decoupled from the theory and the corresponding effective field theory is constructed .",
    "the leading terms of the expansion of @xmath61 in terms of @xmath62 are calculated and evolved to scale @xmath63 using the adm including both qcd and electroweak interactions .",
    "taking only leading terms in @xmath64 restricts the operator basis to dimension 5 and 6 operators@xcite . at @xmath63 ,",
    "the remaining part of @xmath61 , which has been evolved down to @xmath59 using only the ew adm , is added together with eventual contributions coming from decoupling of the lighter particle in the loop . as a last step ,",
    "the equations of motion are applied to obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the case that @xmath65 , the evolution is stopped at @xmath39 . in practise , this is almost never a problem , in light of the new bound @xmath16 gev for gaugino - like charginos from lep2 . in our calculation",
    ", we include contributions from @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 loops , for @xmath69 and 2 , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and neglect contributions from @xmath72 and @xmath73 loops , which should have much smaller contributions . as an illustration of these results",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "1 the final value of the wilson coefficient @xmath54 from the various loop contributions just discussed , as a function of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in frame _ a _ ) @xmath6 , while in frame _ b _ ) , @xmath78 . the @xmath66 sm contribution is just @xmath79 , and of course does nt vary versus susy soft - breaking parameters .",

    "however , we note that the region of parameter space most favored by @xmath5 , cosmology and standard minima of the scalar potential , around @xmath148 gev , @xmath130 gev , @xmath151 and @xmath78 might be accessible to fermilab mi or tev33 searches for clean trileptons ; if not , the discovery of susy would have to wait until lhc experiments are performed .",

    "in addition , we thank manuel drees for calculational comparisons which led to discovery of a bug in the program used to generate results for an earlier version of this manuscript .",
