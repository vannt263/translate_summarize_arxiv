    "i.e. , the scenario on which we focus in this paper , the wave packet decays very quickly by successive tunnelling events , once it has tunnelled across the first band gap .",
    "this is due to the much smaller gaps of the higher energy bands in a sinusoidal potential @xcite .",

    "here we are interested in tunnelling in the wannier - stark problem where the impact of the intrinsic atom - atom interactions in the bec has been studied in several recent experiments @xcite . in those experiments , the difficulty in understanding quantum transport processes , such as coherent tunnelling , originates from the complex interplay between classical transport in the underlying phase space , quantum interference effects , and the many - particle interactions .    in a typical experiment with a bec , where the number of atoms in the condensate is large and",

    "one way to define a time - independent , global tunnelling rate is to renormalise the density of the condensate in the preparation region ( e.g. , in the central potential well of the periodic lattice ) continuously , such that the average density remains constant in time . for experimentally realisable nonlinearities",

    "we adapted and improved the technique developed by one us in @xcite for the more complicated scenario of resonant tunnelling in the wannier - stark problem .",
    "we showed that the mean - field nonlinearity leads to experimentally observable modifications in the tunnelling of resonance states from the periodical potential wells , even in a regime where the kinetic and the periodic potential terms still dominate the dynamics .",
    "the broadening and the shift of the resonant tunnelling peaks define clear signatures for nonlinearity induced effects .    our method can be extended  with further system - specific improvements in the propagation algorithm  to treat even more complicated problems appearing in experiments with bose condensates , e.g. , the transport of coherent matter within atomic wave guides .",
    "finally , we can readily extend the proposed method to three spatial dimensions , with the only drawback of much larger numerical effort .",

    "<S> we present a method to numerically compute accurate tunnelling rates for a bose - einstein condensate which is described by the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",
    "<S> our method is based on a sophisticated real - time integration of the complex - scaled gross - pitaevskii equation , and it is capable of finding the stationary eigenvalues for the wannier - stark problem . we show that even weak nonlinearities have significant effects in the vicinity of very sensitive resonant tunnelling peaks , which occur in the rates as a function of the stark field amplitude . the mean - field interaction induces a broadening and a shift of the peaks , and the latter is explained by analytic perturbation theory . </S>"
