    ", we fitted exponentials to the surface brightness profiles of fcc046 and fcc207 and compared the extrapolated b - band central surface brightnesses and the scale - lengths with those of the virgo des , bcds , and dirrs presented in drinkwater  &  hardy @xcite .",

    "<S> whereas fcc207 has only one central emission region , fcc046 also contains fainter emission regions . </S>",
    "<S> based on broad - band colours , its disturbed shape and its very bright nucleus , fcc046 is akin to the class of amorphous dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the central emission regions of both galaxies are barely resolved under seeing conditions of fwhm@xmath2 and we estimate their diameters at about 60  pc . </S>",
