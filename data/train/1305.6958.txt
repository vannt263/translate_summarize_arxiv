    "category theory has foundational importance because it provides conceptual lenses to characterize what is important and universal in mathematics  with an adjunction ( or pair of adjoint functors ) being the primary lense .",

    "yet this does not seem to be the case , particularly in the life sciences .",
    "perhaps the problem has been finding the right level of generality or specificity where non - trivial applications can be found , i.e. , finding out `` where theory lives . ''",
    "this paper argues that the application of adjoints has been hampered by an overly specific formulation of the adjunctive properties that only uses homomorphisms or homs ( object - to - object morphisms _ within _ a category ) . a reformulation of adjunctions using heteromorphisms or hets ( object - to - object morphisms between objects of _ different _ categories )",

    "this application of category theory in the life sciences is not exact in the sense that , say , calculus is applied in physics .",
    "the category theory is exact at the mathematical level , but it is the general determinative schema of the semiadjunctions that is applied .    there is already a considerable but widely varying literature on the application of category theory to the life sciences  such as the work of robert rosen @xcite and his followers as well as andre ehresmann and jean - paul vanbremeersch @xcite and their commentators .",

    "the approach taken here is based on a specific use of the characteristic concepts of category theory , namely universal mapping properties , to define a general schema of determination through universals .",
    "the closest approach in the literature ( but without the hets and semiadjunctions ) is that of franois magnan and gonzalo reyes @xcite which emphasizes that `` category theory provides means to circumscribe and study what is universal in mathematics and other scientific disciplines . ''",
    "their intended field of application is cognitive science .",

    "it might be noted that in a number of our examples essentially the same faculty , e.g. , the language faculty , plays both the role of the receiving or recognition universal and the sending or action universal . hence it should be possible to recombine the semiadjunctions so that the two universals coincide , and that yields the concept of the brain functor ( the `` brain '' being that universal for both recognition and action ) . from the mathematical viewpoint",

    "a brain functor , broadly put , is any universal mechanism of determination that can factor determination either way through a universal  rather than an adjunction that factors one way determination through two ( receiving and sending ) universals . in some contexts in the life sciences , determination is strictly one way so one might expect to find a semiadjunction but not a two - way system like a brain functor .",
    "for instance , there is the _ fundamental dogma _ that dna determines amino acids , proteins , and eventually the characteristics of an organism but never the reverse .",
    "an application of the scheme for a brain functor in the cognitive sciences is to model the language faculty where there is two way determination between vocal stimuli and internal representations .",

    "regardless of the great differences in the underlying substrate processes , many of the most important mechanisms and faculties of the biological and cognitive sciences not only seem to fit into , but also to have their key features characterized by , the schemes for determination through universals .",
    "category theory groups together in _ categories _ the mathematical objects with some common structure ( e.g. , sets , partially ordered sets , groups , rings , and so forth ) and the appropriate morphisms between such objects .",
    "since the morphisms are between objects of similar structure , they are ordinarily called homomorphisms .",
    "but there have always been other morphisms which occur in mathematical practice that are between objects with different structures ( i.e. , in different categories ) such as the insertion - of - generators map from a set to the free group on that set .",
    "indeed , the working mathematician might well characterize the free group @xmath44 on a set @xmath1 as the group such that for any set - to - group map @xmath45 , there is a unique group homomorphism @xmath46 that factors @xmath47  through the canonical insertion of generators @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 . in order to contrast these morphisms such as @xmath45 and @xmath50 with the homomorphisms between objects within a category such as @xmath46 ,",
