    "the fact that our universe is almost flat , homogeneous and isotropic is often considered as a strong indication that the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles is not complete .",
    "indeed , these puzzles , together with the problem of generation of ( almost ) scale invariant spectrum of perturbations , necessary for structure formation , are most elegantly solved by inflation @xcite .",
    "the majority of present models of inflation require an introduction of an additional scalar  the `` inflaton '' .",
    "this hypothetical particle may appear in a natural or not so natural way in different extensions of the sm , involving grand unified theories ( guts ) , supersymmetry , string theory , extra dimensions , etc .",
    "inflaton properties are constrained by the observations of fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the matter distribution in the universe .",
    "though the mass and the interaction of the inflaton with matter fields are not fixed , the well known considerations prefer a heavy scalar field with a mass @xmath0{gev}$ ] and extremely small self - interacting quartic coupling constant @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this value of the mass is close to the gut scale , which is often considered as an argument in favour of existence of new physics between the electroweak and planck scales .",
    "the aim of the present letter is to demonstrate that the sm itself can give rise to inflation .",
    "the spectral index and the amplitude of tensor perturbations can be predicted and be used to distinguish this possibility from other models for inflation ; these parameters for the sm fall within the @xmath2 confidence contours of the wmap-3 observations @xcite .    to explain our main idea , consider lagrangian of the sm non - minimally coupled to gravity , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the sm part , @xmath5 is some mass parameter",
    ", @xmath6 is the scalar curvature , @xmath7 is the higgs field , and @xmath8 is an unknown constant to be fixed later .. ] the third term in ( [ main ] ) is in fact required by the renormalization properties of the scalar field in a curved space - time background @xcite . if @xmath9 , the coupling of the higgs field to gravity is said to be `` minimal '' .",
    "then @xmath5 can be identified with planck scale @xmath10 related to the newton s constant as @xmath11{gev}$ ] .",
    "this model has `` good '' particle physics phenomenology but gives `` bad '' inflation since the self - coupling of the higgs field is too large and matter fluctuations are many orders of magnitude larger than those observed .",
    "another extreme is to put @xmath5 to zero and consider the `` induced '' gravity @xcite , in which the electroweak symmetry breaking generates the planck mass @xcite .",
    "this happens if @xmath12 , where @xmath13{gev}$ ] is the electroweak scale .",
    "this model may give `` good '' inflation @xcite even if the scalar self - coupling is of the order of one , but most probably fails to describe particle physics experiments .",
    "indeed , the higgs field in this case almost completely decouples from other fields of the sm ) , given in the jordan frame , to the einstein frame , see also below . ]",
    "@xcite , which corresponds formally to the infinite higgs mass @xmath14 .",
    "this is in conflict with the precision tests of the electroweak theory which tell that @xmath14 must be below @xmath15{gev}$ ] @xcite or even @xcite if less conservative point of view is taken .",
    "these arguments indicate that there may exist some intermediate choice of @xmath5 and @xmath8 which is `` good '' for particle physics and for inflation at the same time . indeed ,",
    "if the parameter @xmath8 is sufficiently small , @xmath16 , we are very far from the regime of induced gravity and the low energy limit of the theory ( [ main ] ) is just the sm with the usual higgs boson . at the same time , if @xmath8 is sufficiently large , @xmath17 , the scalar field behaviour , relevant for chaotic inflation scenario @xcite , drastically changes , and successful inflation becomes possible .",
    "we should note , that models of chaotic inflation with both nonzero @xmath5 and @xmath8 were considered in literature @xcite , but in the context of either gut or with an additional inflaton having nothing to do with the higgs field of the standard model .",
    "the letter is organised as follows .",
    "we start from discussion of inflation in the model , and use the slow - roll approximation to find the perturbation spectra parameters .",
    "then we will argue in section [ sec : radcorr ] that quantum corrections are unlikely to spoil the classical analysis we used in section [ sec : cmb ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "let us consider the scalar sector of the standard model , coupled to gravity in a non - minimal way .",
    "we will use the unitary gauge @xmath18 and neglect all gauge interactions for the time being , they will be discussed later in section [ sec : radcorr ] . then the lagrangian has the form : @xmath19",
    "this lagrangian has been studied in detail in many papers on inflation @xcite , we will reproduce here the main results of @xcite . to simplify the formulae",
    ", we will consider only @xmath8 in the region @xmath20 , in which @xmath21 with very good accuracy .",
    "it is possible to get rid of the non - minimal coupling to gravity by making the conformal transformation from the jordan frame to the einstein frame @xmath22 this transformation leads to a non - minimal kinetic term for the higgs field .",
    "so , it is convenient to make the change to the new scalar field @xmath23 with @xmath24 finally , the action in the einstein frame is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is calculated using the metric @xmath27 and the potential is @xmath28 for small field values @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so the potential for the field @xmath23 is the same as that for the initial higgs field .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) the situation changes a lot . in this limit",
    "@xmath33 this means that the potential for the higgs field is exponentially flat and has the form @xmath34 the full effective potential in the einstein frame is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ueff ] .",
    "it is the flatness of the potential at @xmath35 which makes the successful ( chaotic ) inflation possible .",
    "analysis of the inflation in the einstein frame can be performed in standard way using the slow - roll approximation .",
    "the slow roll parameters ( in notations of @xcite ) can be expressed analytically as functions of the field @xmath36 using ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) ( in the limit of @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 slow roll ends when @xmath39 , so the field value at the end of inflation is @xmath40 .",
    "the number of e - foldings for the change of the field @xmath41 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 we see that for all values of @xmath45 the scale of the standard model @xmath46 does not enter in the formulae , so the inflationary physics is independent on it . since interactions of the higgs boson with the particles of the sm after the end of inflation are strong , the reheating happens right after the slow - roll , and @xmath47{gev}$ ] , where @xmath48 is the number of degrees of freedom of the sm",
    "so , the number of e - foldings for the the cobe scale entering the horizon @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath50 . inserting ( [ eq:8 ] ) into the cobe normalization @xmath51",
    "we find the required value for @xmath8 @xmath52 note , that if one could deduce @xmath8 from some fundamental theory this relation would provide a connection between the higgs mass and the amplitude of primordial perturbations .",
    "the spectral index @xmath53 calculated for @xmath54 ( corresponding to the scale @xmath55 ) is @xmath56 .",
    "the tensor to scalar perturbation ratio @xcite is @xmath57 .",
    "the predicted values are well within one sigma of the current wmap measurements @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wmap ] .    , @xmath58 ) .",
    "the green boxes are our predictions supposing 50 and 60 e - foldings of inflation .",
    "black and white dots are predictions of usual chaotic inflation with @xmath59 and @xmath60 potentials , hz is the harrison - zeldovich spectrum . ]",
    "an essential point for inflation is the flatness of the scalar potential in the region of the field values @xmath61 , what corresponds to the einstein frame field @xmath62 .",
    "it is important that radiative corrections do not spoil this property .",
    "of course , any discussion of quantum corrections is flawed by the non - renormalizable character of gravity , so the arguments we present below are not rigorous .",
    "there are two qualitatively different type of corrections one can think about . the first one is related to the quantum gravity contribution .",
    "it is conceivable to think @xcite that these terms are proportional to the energy density of the field @xmath23 rather than its value and are of the order of magnitude @xmath63 .",
    "they are small at large @xmath8 required by observations . moreover , adding non - renormalizable operators @xmath64 to the lagrangian ( [ eq:1 ] ) also does not change the flatness of the potential in the inflationary region .. ]    other type of corrections is induced by the fields of the standard model coupled to the higgs field . in one loop approximation",
    "these contributions have the structure @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mass of the particle ( vector boson , fermion , or the higgs field itself ) in the background of field @xmath23 , and @xmath67 is the normalization point .",
    "note that the terms of the type @xmath68 ( related to quadratic divergences ) do not appear in scale - invariant subtraction schemes that are based , for example , on dimensional regularisation ( see a relevant discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the masses of the sm fields can be readily computed @xcite and have the form @xmath69 for fermions , vector bosons and the higgs ( inflaton ) field .",
    "it is crucial that for large @xmath23 these masses approach different constants ( i.e.  the one - loop contribution is as flat as the tree potential ) and that ( [ 1loop ] ) is suppressed by the gauge or yukawa couplings in comparison with the tree term .",
    "in other words , one - loop radiative corrections do not spoil the flatness of the potential as well .",
    "this argument is identical to the one given in @xcite .",
    "another important correction is connected with running of the non - minimal coupling @xmath8 to gravity .",
    "the corresponding renormalization group equation is @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the top yukawa coupling , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are su(2 ) and u(1 ) couplings of the standard model and @xmath67 is the characteristic scale .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath8 from @xmath74 to the planck scale is considerable , @xmath75 . at the same time , the change of @xmath8 in the inflationary region is small , @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the logarithmic running of @xmath8 does not change the behaviour of the potential required for inflation .",
    "there is also the induced one - loop pure gravitational term of the form @xmath77 . during the inflationary epoch",
    "it is smaller than the tree term @xmath78 by the higgs self - coupling @xmath79 and does not change the conclusion .",
    "in this letter we argued that inflation can be a natural consequence of the standard model , rather than an indication of its weakness . the price to pay is very modest  a non - minimal coupling of the higgs field to gravity",
    ". an interesting consequence of this hypothesis is that the amplitude of scalar perturbations is proportional to the square of the higgs mass ( at fixed @xmath8 ) , revealing a non - trivial connection between electroweak symmetry breaking and the structure of the universe .",
    "the specific prediction of the inflationary parameters ( spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio ) can distinguish it from other models ( based , e.g.  on inflaton with quadratic potential ) , provided these parameters are determined with better accuracy .",
    "the inflation mechanism we discussed has in fact a general character and can be used in many extensions of the sm .",
    "thus , the @xmath80msm of @xcite ( sm plus three light fermionic singlets ) can explain simultaneously neutrino masses , dark matter , baryon asymmetry of the universe and inflation without introducing any additional particles ( the @xmath80msm with the inflaton was considered in @xcite ) .",
    "this provides an extra argument in favour of absence of a new energy scale between the electroweak and planck scales , advocated in @xcite .",
