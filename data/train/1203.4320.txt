    "the lightest scalar meson `` sigma '' is an interesting object which may give a clue to understand the fundamental problems of qcd such as the chiral symmetry structure , the origin of mass and so on .",
    "the mass spectrum of the light scalar meson nonet including the sigma meson disfavors the @xmath4 picture but prefers the @xmath5 interpretation . if in the nature there are both @xmath4 and @xmath5 states , they mix to give the physical scalar mesons . in this",
    "write - up , we summarize a main point of ref .  , where we studied the quark structure of the sigma meson in the heavy - light meson decay , @xmath9 , based on the chiral partner structure between ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we first determine the sigma meson mass @xmath12 and the @xmath13-@xmath14-@xmath14 coupling constant @xmath15 by fitting the @xmath16-wave @xmath14-@xmath14 scattering data below 560 mev , the maximum energy transferred to the two pions in the @xmath7 decay . after a construction of an effective lagrangian for interactions among light mesons and heavy mesons",
    ", we show how the @xmath7 decay width depends on the quark structure of the sigma meson .",
    "we introduce a linear sigma model for three flavor qcd in low energy region by including @xmath17 chiral nonet fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 representing the @xmath20 and @xmath5 states respectively .",
    "these two chiral nonets have the same transformation property under the chiral su(3)@xmath21su(3)@xmath22 symmetry : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 su(3)@xmath25 . on the other hand",
    ", they have the following different u(1)@xmath6 transformation properties : @xmath26 with @xmath27 as the phase factor of the axial transformation .",
    "we decompose @xmath28 as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the scalar nonet and @xmath31 is the pseudoscalar nonet . in this study , we adopt the following extended linear sigma model  @xcite : @xmath32 where the first two terms are kinetic terms of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 fields , @xmath33 is the su(3)@xmath21 su(3)@xmath22 invariant potential and @xmath34 stands for explicite chiral symmetry breaking terms due to current quark masses .",
    "here we consider the chiral limit case , that is , @xmath35 .",
    "we distinguish the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states by their u(1)@xmath6 charges .",
    "this u(1)@xmath6 symmetry is explicitly broken by anomaly . as a result ,",
    "physical mesons are given as mixing states of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states through mixing matrices , for example , iso - singlet scalar mesons are @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the mass eigenstates with mass ordering @xmath38 while @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in the following we call the lightest @xmath43 the sigma ( @xmath13 ) meson .",
    "similarly , for iso - triplet pseudoscalar meson , we have @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the phyisical state while @xmath46 is @xmath47 state . in the present analysis",
    ", we identify @xmath45 as @xmath48 .",
    "the above pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath49 relates to the pion decay constant and vaccume expectation values @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 scalar fields , respectively . in the chiral limit",
