    "the skew brownian motion ( sbm ) has attracted interest within other facts , due to its relations with diffusions with discontinuous coefficients or to media with permeable barriers , being the first example of the solution of a stochastic differential equation with the local time of the solution as drift @xcite : the sbm @xmath0 can be defined as the strong solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a standard brownian motion defined on a probability space @xmath3 , the initial condition is @xmath4 ( the case @xmath5 is symmetrical ) , @xmath6 $ ] is the _ skewness parameter _ , and @xmath7 is the local time at level zero of the ( unknown ) solution @xmath8 of the equation departing from @xmath9 , defined by @xmath10 in case @xmath11 we denote @xmath12 , being this case particularly interesting due to some explicit calculations that can be carried out ( see section [ section : ld ] ) .    in the literature",
    "the skewness parameter is sometimes defined as @xmath13 ; this second parametrization being more convenient for an alternative construction of the sbm : depart from the reflected brownian motion and choose , independently with probability @xmath14 $ ] , whether each particular excursion of the reflected brownian motion remains positive .    in the special case @xmath15 ,",
    "the solution to is the reflected brownian motion .",
    "the case @xmath16 corresponds to the the standard brownian motion .",
    "recently , several papers have considered the sbm in modelling or simulation issues , as well as some optimization problems .",
    "see the review by a.  lejay @xcite for references on the subject , as well as a survey of the various possible constructions and applications of the sbm .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the statistical estimation of @xmath17 , the skewness parameter , when we observe a trajectory of the process through an equally spaced time grid . from the statistical point of view",
    "we find this problem interesting because it is in certain sense intermediate between the classical problem of drift estimation in a diffusion , where the measures generated by the trajectories of the process for different values of the parameter are equivalent @xcite , and the estimation of the variance ( the volatility in financial terms ) of a diffusion ( see for instance @xcite , or @xcite and the references therein ) , where the probability measures generated by the trajectories are singular for different values of the parameter . at the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only estimator of @xmath17 is the one constructed by o.  bardou and m.  martinez  @xcite , where they assume that the sbm is reflected at levels @xmath18 and @xmath19 to ensure ergodicity , considering a different scheme of observation of the trajectory .",
    "our main result states that the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) corresponding to the observation of a discretization of one trajectory of the process , with the corresponding normalization , satisfies the so called local asymptotically mixed normality ( lamn ) property at the point @xmath20 . with this result and the identification of the limiting distribution of the scaled mle estimator",
    ", one may construct some hypothesis test to determine whether or not the brownian is skew .",
    "this fact suggests certain asymptotic properties of the mle , as exposed for instance in the classical book of ibragimov and hasminskii @xcite . nevertheless , as our results in terms of convergence of statistical experiments are not exactly the ones needed in the hypothesis of general lamn theorems , we follow a direct approach to construct the estimator and to study its asymptotic properties .",
    "this approach , that can be followed in rare occasions , has the advantage of clarifying the proof of the asymptotic properties and providing insight in the corresponding numerical computations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the maximum likelihood methodology and the convergence results . in section 3",
    "we describe the limit distribution .",
    "sections 4 presents the statistical test and some numerical simulations on the likelihood function .",
    "section 5 presents an application to diffusion of species in two different habitats , and section 6 our conclusions .",
    "finally , in the appendix we provide the theorems taken from @xcite used in the proof of our main results in section 2 .",
    "consider the sbm @xmath8 with parameter @xmath21 defined in and the sampling scheme denoted by @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . in this section",
    "we derive the asymptotic behaviour of maximum likelihood estimator @xmath24 of the parameter @xmath17 when we observe the sample @xmath25 .",
    "the transition density of the sbm of parameter @xmath6 $ ] is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density of a gaussian random variable with variance @xmath28 and mean @xmath29 .",
    "the likelihood of the sample is given by @xmath30 observing that for any @xmath31 we have @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 ) , we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 to see that @xmath36 is a polynomial of degree @xmath37 , with @xmath37 real roots . remember that we assume @xmath38 . in case",
    "the trajectory we observe does not hit the zero level , we obtain @xmath39 and @xmath36 is increasing in @xmath17 . in this case",
    "our maximum likelihood estimator is @xmath40 . in the case",
    "that the trajectory crosses the zero level , we see that the polynomial has roots @xmath41 ( for large enough @xmath37 ) , and no roots inside this interval . as @xmath42 ,",
    "this gives a unique maximum at the point @xmath24 in the interval @xmath43 .",
    "our main result is the weak convergence of the mle to a distribution that we characterize .",
    "three main differences can be noted in respect to the classical statistical situation : ( i ) the convergence of the estimator is more slowly ( @xmath44 ) than in the classical case ; ( ii ) the limit is not gaussian , but a mixture of gaussian random variables ; ( iii ) the convergence is stable , stronger than the usual convergence in distribution , but natural in this context , known as local asymptotic mixed normality ( lamn ) in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we also have to take into account , in accordance to our previous discussions on the existence and the value of the mle , that the event that the trajectory hits the level zero is crucial in the results we obtain ( in fact , if the trajectory does not hit this level , the mle remains constant for all @xmath37 ) .",
    "consider then the events @xmath45 as @xmath8 is continuous , @xmath46 a.s .",
    "( @xmath47 stands for the indicator of the set @xmath48 ) .",
    "we now review the stable convergence ( see @xcite ) , and introduce the conditional stable convergence that will take place in our case .",

    "for example , we see in figure  [ fig-5 ] an approximation of the density of @xmath145 for @xmath296 compared to an approximation of the density of @xmath145 for the brownian motion with @xmath297 .",
    "we can note that the histogram of @xmath145 has its peak on @xmath298 .",
    "as endowed in the introduction , the sbm is a fundamental tool when one has to model a permeable barrier .",
    "in addition , it appears when one writes down the processes generated by diffusion equations with discontinuous coefficients in a one dimensional media : this issue is presented in the survey article @xcite with references to the articles where the sbm arised and covering various fields , such as ecology , finance , astrophysics , geophysics , ...    we present here a possible application to ecology of our hypothesis test , which can be surely applied to other fields .",
    "diffusions are commonly used in ecology to explain the spread of a specie , at the level of individual cells ( see for example the book @xcite ) or the level of an animal in a wild environment .",
    "several authors have proposed the use of biased diffusions to model the behavior of a specie at the boundary between two habitats @xcite ) , when the species diffuse with different species at speed in each habitat .",
    "now , consider a situation where the dispersion of a specie in two different habitats is well modelled by a diffusion process , and that the measurement of the diffusion coefficient give the same value .",
    "does it means that the boundary has no effect on the displacement of the individuals ?    let us apply this in a one - dimensional world , where one habitat is @xmath299 and the other is @xmath300 $ ] .",
    "we assume that we may track the position of an individual , whose displacement in each of the habitat is given by @xmath301 .    then",
    ", we may apply our hypothesis test to determine whether or not the position shall be modelled by @xmath302 or by @xmath303 under hypothesis @xmath304 , the boundary has no effect and is not seen . under hypothesis @xmath305 ,",
    "the individual is more likely to go in one of the two habitat , depending on the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "now , let us consider that we have a measurement of the diffusion coefficients that gives two different values @xmath306 on @xmath307 and @xmath308 on @xmath309 .",
    "one may then wonder which differential operator shall be used to model the diffusive behavior . for @xmath310 , is it @xmath311 on @xmath312 and @xmath313 , there is no difference between these two operators , which means that the local dynamic of the particle / individual is not affected by the choice of @xmath314 and @xmath61 .",
    "however , the difference arises at @xmath29 : the process @xmath8 generated by @xmath314 is solution to @xmath315 while the process @xmath54 generated by @xmath61 is solution to @xmath316 for a brownian motion @xmath48 ( see for example @xcite ) . from the analytical point of view : the domain @xmath317 of @xmath61 contains the functions of class @xmath318 which are bounded with bounded , first and second order derivatives .",
    "the domain @xmath319 of @xmath314 contains functions of class @xmath320 with bounded first and second order derivatives which are furthermore continuous at @xmath29 , and such that @xmath321 .",
    "this condition is called the _",
    "flux condition_. in many physical situations , it is assumed that the flux @xmath322 is continuous and this is why divergence - form operators of type @xmath314 arise .",
    "both @xmath314 and @xmath61 can be embedded in a single class of operators of type @xmath323 .",
    "if @xmath324 and @xmath325 are constant on @xmath312 and @xmath313 , then we may use the following characterization : let us consider @xmath326 and @xmath327 this class of operators is then specified by three parameters , @xmath328 , @xmath329 and  @xmath330 .",
    "the operator @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath331 , while @xmath314 corresponds to @xmath332 .    for @xmath333 ,",
    "@xmath334 is solution to the sde @xcite @xmath335 while @xmath336 is solution to the sde @xmath337 we then see that both @xmath338 and @xmath339 are skew brownian motions , but the coefficients in front of their local time have opposite signs .",
    "even if we have not studied the asymptotic behavior of the mle for the sbm with skewness parameter different from @xmath29 , numerical experiments back the following hypotheses test :    1 .   given an observed @xmath8 , estimate the diffusion coefficient for the process on each side of @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   apply the function @xmath340 to the observed process .",
    "3 .   compute the mle @xmath24 of the skewness parameter . if @xmath341 ( resp .",
    "@xmath342 ) and @xmath343 then decided that the infinitesimal generator of  @xmath8 is @xmath314 ( resp .",
    "@xmath61 ) . otherwise , decide that it is @xmath61 ( resp .",
    "@xmath314 ) .",
    "in this article , we have studied the behavior of the maximum likelihood for the skew brownian motion when the parameter to estimate is @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the rate of convergence of the estimator  @xmath24 is @xmath44 and not @xmath344 as in the classical case .",
    "this should not be surprising : indeed , away from  @xmath29 , the skew brownian motion behaves like a brownian motion , and only its dynamic close to  @xmath29 allows one to see the difference between a skew brownian motion with a parameter @xmath293 and a brownian motion .",
    "it is also not surprising that the local time enters in the limit distribution .",
    "the case @xmath293 remains open .",
    "one needs to prove results similar to the one of j.  jacod @xcite , when the brownian motion is replaced by the skew brownian motion ( its distribution with respect to the wiener measure is singular ) .",
    "of course , one can not expect the limit law to be symmetric .",
    "yet , it is pretty easy to simulate the skew brownian motion and to estimate the maximum likelihood , so that numerical studies are easy to perform .",
    "in this appendix we provide the theorems given in @xcite used for the proofs of the main results in section 2 .",
    "we slightly change the notation and present the results in the particular cases that are relevant to us in the present work .",
    "it must be noticed that the convergence in , as stated in @xcite , is stronger , in the sense that both terms in are processes ( i.e. depend on @xmath28 ) and the convergence is locally uniformly in time , in probability . recall that a sequence @xmath352 of processes is said to _ converges locally uniformly in time , in probability _ , to a limiting processes @xmath57 if for any @xmath353 the sequence @xmath354 goes to @xmath29 in probability .",

    "the constant @xmath358 is given in for the function @xmath359 .",
