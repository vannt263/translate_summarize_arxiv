    "while it is experimentally established that neutrino masses are not zero ( see @xcite for some overviews ) , the mechanism behind them is unknown .",
    "several distinct ideas have been pursued over the last few decades and the hope is that , ultimately , experiments will equip us with enough information to figure out which one , if any , is correct .",
    "the gauge quantum numbers of all fermion fields in the standard model are such that relevant fermion mass operators are forbidden by gauge invariance , and fermion masses arise only after electroweak symmetry breaking . in the case of charged fermions ,",
    "masses are a consequence of yukawa couplings between different chiral fermions and the @xmath0 doublet higgs scalar field .",
    "when this higgs field acquires an expectation value breaking electroweak symmetry , pairs of chiral fermions combine and acquire dirac masses . assuming that this scenario is correct , not only are the fermions masses generated but one is able to make two well - defined predictions : at leading order , the couplings between the propagating higgs boson and the different fermions with a well - defined mass are ( i ) diagonal and ( ii ) unambiguously determined by the fermion masses .",
    "for example , @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the lepton doublet fields , @xmath6 are the ( anti)lepton doublet fields and @xmath7 is the higgs doublet scalar field , and @xmath8 are dimensionless yukawa couplings .",
    "we choose a weak basis for the leptons such that the yukawa interactions are diagonal and @xmath9 .",
    "when the higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath10 , @xmath11  gev , the three charged fermions acquire masses @xmath12 and the couplings between the charged leptons and the propagating higgs boson @xmath13 are @xmath14 , i.e. , after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath15    masses for the active neutrinos ( those that couple to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 gauge bosons , @xmath18 ) , regardless of how they are generated , must also arise as a consequence of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore , new degrees of freedom must be added to the lagrangian in order to allow neutrino masses .",
    "for example , if one adds gauge singlet ( anti)leptons @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) to the standard model particle content and only considers the new yukawa interactions @xmath21 neutrinos also acquire dirac masses and , as above , their couplings to the higgs boson are diagonal in the mass - eigenstate basis and proportional to the neutrino mass eigenvalues , which in turn are proportional the square - root of the eigenvalues of the square of the yukawa coupling matrix , @xmath22 , as in the case of the charged fermions .",
    "life , however , can be more interesting .",
    "since neutrinos are singlets of the unbroken @xmath23 gauge symmetry , they are , unlike all charged fermions , allowed to acquire majorana masses",
    ". these may arise from several distinct @xmath24 gauge invariant lagrangians , which will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : lagrangian ] .",
    "if that is the case , the couplings between the neutrinos and the electroweak symmetry breaking sector ( neutrino  higgs sector ) need not be diagonal in the mass basis .",

    "higgs sector .",
    "they are uniquely determined by the neutrino mass eigenvalues and the elements of the lepton mixing matrix @xmath25 .",

    "for other discussions of this interesting issue from different points of view see also @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for earlier discussions .",
    "both the parameter counting and the allowed ranges above apply below the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and in the absence of new interactions . for example , the number of physical parameters in the mixing matrix depends on the fact that the sterile degrees of freedom are sterile so that one is free to perform `` sterile  only '' rotations indiscriminately .",
    "we extend the analysis in @xcite to include the neutrino  higgs interactions and ask whether an extended physical range , or new mixing parameters , are necessary . naively , it is easy to see why the answer might be ` yes ' since yukawa couplings of different kinds may qualify as new interactions .",
    "for example , if majorana masses for the singlet fermions @xmath19 arise from yukawa interactions with a gauge singlet scalar @xmath34 that acquires a vacuum expectation value ( operators of the type @xmath35 so @xmath36 ) one should question whether `` sterile  only '' rotations can be performed with impunity .",

    "not surprisingly , the total is 18 , as required .",
    "note that this is much less than the number of parameters for a generic @xmath198 @xmath65 which requires 6 masses and 24 real parameters in the mixing matrix @xmath25 .",

    "this indicates that if one chooses the range of parameters in the active leptonic mixing matrix in the standard fashion , one must be sure to properly parameterize @xmath194 and explore the full physical range of its parameters .",

    "active neutrino masses , like all standard model charged - fermion masses , only arise after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this is true regardless of the nature of the neutrinos or the mechanism responsible for their finite masses .",
    "if the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking can be captured by the vacuum expectation values of scalar fields , fermion masses arise due to the interactions between the fermions and these scalar fields .    in the case of the charged - fermions in the standard model , charged - fermions",
    "will couple to the propagating higgs boson in a mass - diagonal way , and the magnitude of these couplings is proportional to the individual charged - fermion masses , as is well known .",
    "this is also the case of neutrinos if they are massive dirac fermions . in this case , of course , the standard model lagrangian is augmented to include at least two standard model gauge singlet weyl fermions , the so - called right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if the neutrinos are majorana fermions and if right - handed neutrinos are propagating degrees of freedom , the couplings of neutrinos to the higgs sector will depend not only on the neutrino masses but also on a subset of the mixing parameters that define the full neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "furthermore , in the neutrino mass - eigenstate basis , the couplings are not necessarily diagonal .",
    "we discussed in detail how to properly parameterize the couplings of the neutrino ",
    "higgs sector .",
    "we find that neutrino yukawa couplings are well - defined functions of all the neutrino mass eigenvalues and the `` active  sterile '' mixing parameters in the full neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "furthermore , we can still choose to constrain the ranges of the parameters that define the elements of the mixing matrix to the ones that are required in order to properly describe the weak interactions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this means if we choose all neutrino masses to be positive , allow all mixing angles to lie in the first quadrant ( @xmath1 $ ] ) , and allow all majorana phases to lie in the first two quadrants ( @xmath2 $ ] ) we will properly parameterize all physically distinguishable outcomes for processes involving interactions between all leptons ( including right - handed neutrinos ) and gauge bosons or higgs bosons , as long as all dirac phases are allowed to vary within the entire unit circle ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this result applies not only to the lepton couplings to the standard model higgs doublet but can be extended to include a higgs boson @xmath0 triplet and a higgs boson standard model singlet .",
    "this is true as long as all elements of the neutrino mass matrix are proportional to the vacuum expectation values of these different scalar fields .    unlike the quark mixing sector , many of the potentially physical parameters in the lepton mixing sector are completely unknown .",
    "we do nt know whether there are right - handed neutrinos , higgs - boson triplets , or higgs - boson singlets , we do nt know whether neutrinos are majorana fermions , and we do nt even know the magnitudes of the mostly - acitve neutrino masses .",
    "we only know that there are at least three neutrinos , and we have measured two mass - squared differences and the values of two mixing angles .",
    "we can infer that a third mixing angle exists , along with a dirac phase , although both of them could be zero .",
    "regardless of all the uncertainty , many of the hypothetical parameters , if they exist , play a pivotal role in potentially important processes , including leptogenesis , expectations of supersymmetric theories for charged - lepton flavor - violating processes , etc .",
    "for this reason we discussed relations between the parameterization discussed here and the casas  ibarra parameterization , and discussed the physical range of the parameters in the latter case .    in conclusion , the issue of properly parameterizing both the gauge and yukawa sectors and understanding how to access the entire allowed parameter space is particularly important in the neutrino sector .",
    "we also have empirical evidence that it is an issue that often leads to misunderstanding among even seasoned neutrino phenomenologists and to confusing statements in the neutrino literature .",
    "we hope our results will help clarify some of the confusion .",
    "finally , we will emphasize some important provisos .",
    "the results presented here apply assuming that , other than the yukawa interactions highlighted above , there are no new interactions involving active or sterile neutrinos . if for example , the right - handed neutrinos couple to some singlet fermion @xmath34 in a way that these new couplings @xmath256 are not related to the right - handed neutrino majorana mass parameters @xmath257 , the @xmath256 couplings will not depend only on neutrino masses and mixing angles but will also depend on some extra parameters .",
    "we also assume that the new neutrino degrees of freedom are standard model gauge singlets .",
    "if one were to enlarge the particle content of the standard model by including fermionic @xmath0 triplets with zero hypercharge , nonzero neutrino masses would be generated ( this is the type - iii seesaw @xcite ) , but the neutrino mixing space would be modified since fermion triplets also couple to the @xmath16-boson .",
