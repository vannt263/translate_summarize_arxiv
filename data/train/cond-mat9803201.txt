    "the discovery of colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) in hole - doped ferromagnetic manganite materials of the form ( ln)@xmath5(a)@xmath6mno@xmath7 , where ln is a lanthanide and a is an alkaline - earth element , has revived interest in this complex magnetic system.@xcite these systems crystallize in a pseudo - cubic perovskite structure .",
    "the electronically active orbitals are the mn d - orbitals and the number of electrons per mn is @xmath8 .",
    "hund s rule coupling implies that 3 electrons are localized on the @xmath9  orbitals forming a core spin of @xmath10 , while the remaining @xmath11 electrons go into a band derived from the @xmath12orbitals .",
    "when the material is doped in the range of @xmath13 , it undergoes a phase transition between a paramagnetic insulator and a ferromagnetic metal at temperature @xmath3 .    the double - exchange model proposed by zener@xcite was the mechanism first used to explain the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transformation in these conducting materials . in this model",
    "the hopping probability between mn sites for the electrons residing on the @xmath12  orbitals is maximal when the core spins are parallel and minimal when they are antiparallel .",
    "hence , the model provides a qualitative explanation for the metallic conduction below @xmath3  ( spins well aligned ) , and insulating behavior above @xmath3(spins randomly aligned ) .",
    "however , recent theoretical as well as experimental reports suggest that , within this model , the coupling between the charge and spin is not enough to explain the high temperature insulating phase .",
    "in particular , theoretical arguments@xcite indicate the need to include effects that are related to the strong coupling between charge and the lattice such as the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect associated with the mn@xmath14 ions . in this picture",
    "a jt distortion lifts the degeneracy in the @xmath12 orbitals causing a splitting into lower and upper @xmath12 levels that is static for @xmath15 and appears to be dynamic for @xmath16 . since the jt distortion is associated with the mn@xmath14 ions it can localize the @xmath12 electrons in the paramagnetic phase of the alloys leading to insulating behavior . whereas , the increased @xmath17band width in the ferromagnetic state quenches the jt effect and produces metallic conduction .",
    "optical absorption studies of the stoichiometric parent compound lamno@xmath2  give evidence for static jt distortions .",
    "analysis of the optical conductivity of lamno@xmath2 within the local - spin - density approximation suggests that the observed gap in the optical conductivity of about 1.0 ev corresponds to the optical process of promoting a hole between the jt split @xmath18  bands on the mn@xmath14 ions.@xcite optical measurements have also been reported for the series of compounds la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath19.@xcite the results from optical reflectivity studies of metallic samples ( @xmath16 ) show large transfers of spectral weight from high frequencies to low frequencies as the samples are cooled from the paramagnetic state through @xmath3  into the ferromagnetic metallic state.@xcite in these studies it is also concluded that a simple double - exchange picture is not enough to explain the observed changes in the optical spectral weight over such a large energy scale compared to @xmath20 for all doping concentrations.@xcite other recent experimental results also suggest the presence of strong lattice effects in these materials : shifts in the ir phonon frequencies related to the mn@xmath21o bonds in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 near @xmath3 have been reported by kim @xmath22@xcite ; anomalies in the local structure of the mno@xmath23 octahedron near @xmath3  obtained from neutron scattering studies of la@xmath24ca@xmath6mno@xmath2 have been interpreted in terms of jahn - teller distortions@xcite ; a magnetic field driven structural phase transformation was observed@xcite in la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath25for @xmath26 ; thermopower measurements of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2have also suggested the presence of small polaronic behavior above @xmath3that is found to disappear below the insulator - metal transition.@xcite    localization of the @xmath12 electron on the mn@xmath14 ions in the paramagnetic state of the doped manganites due to jahn - teller distortions is a self - trapping effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , a small polaron.@xcite if the carriers are localized due to this electron - phonon coupling , there should be an optical signature of the small polaron associated with photo - induced hopping of the carriers , as has been reported in systems such as tio@xmath27.@xcite in an earlier publication we reported evidence for the jt small polaron in nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2.@xcite in this paper we present an extension of that earlier work by comparing the optical conductivity derived from transmittance and reflectance measurements of la@xmath28sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and an oxygen annealed nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 thin film as a function of temperature and for photon energies up to 5 ev . as in the previous work , the optical conductivity on these new films show large shifts in spectral weight from visible to infrared frequencies as the temperature is lowered through @xmath29 , demonstrating broadband changes in electronic properties on an energy scale several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath30@xmath3 . in the paramagnetic - insulating state of all three materials the optical conductivity at low energies",
    "is characterized by a broad maximum near 1 ev as we reported earlier for nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  and interpreted in terms of the photon induced hopping of the jahn - teller small polaron .",
    "therefore these new experiments show that this feature is generic for the paramagnetic state of the pseudo - cubic manganites .",
    "this spectral feature is found to shift to lower energy and grow in optical oscillator strength as the system enters into the ferromagnetic state .",
    "it gradually transforms into a drude - like response well below @xmath3 where the transport is metallic .",
    "nevertheless , the polaron peak can still be identified at temperatures substantially below @xmath3 .    at higher frequencies ,",

    "the energy position of this feature suggests that it involves transitions between the hund s rule spin - split @xmath12 derived bands .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity for the three samples that we studied using standard four - probe measurements .",

    "these values are close to the curie temperature @xmath3  in these samples .",
    "in addition to the observed progression in @xmath3 , there is also a variation in the low - temperature value of the resistivity @xmath38 .",
    "the values for @xmath39 at @xmath40 k are 350 @xmath41 for nsmo , 300 @xmath42 for lcmo , and 10 @xmath41 for the lsmo sample . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these are the lowest values for the resistivities ever reported for these materials indicative of the high quality of these thin film samples .",
    "the observed low temperature resistivities correspond to conductivities greater than the mott minimum conductivity ( @xmath43 if the carrier density is determined by the divalent alkaline earth substitution @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the unit cell volume ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the low temperature resistivities previously reported in the literature for bulk and film samples generally correspond to conductivities below the mott minimum conductivity which suggests that those samples were not homogeneous .",
    "our results imply that previous reports do not reflect intrinsic behavior , perhaps because of sample inhomogeneity .",
    "we suggest that proposals of `` super - unitary '' scattering@xcite be re - examined as the intrinsic behavior becomes better determined .",
    "transmittance and reflectance measurements were performed using a fourier transform spectrometer ( bomem da3 ) to cover the investigated regions of 5 mev to 25 mev and 0.20 ev to 5 ev .",
    "these are the frequency ranges for which the laalo@xmath2 substrate is transparent .",
    "measurements in this wide range of frequencies were accomplished by using different combinations of sources , beamsplitters and detectors .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute transmittance obtained from the reproducibility in the different spectral ranges is @xmath46% .",
    "likewise , the uncertainty in the absolute reflectance spectra is estimated at @xmath47% .",
    "temperature dependent measurements were made possible by mounting the samples on the cold finger of a continuous flow cryostat with room temperature windows for optical access .",
    "the cryostat unit was placed inside the sample compartment of the spectrometer .",
    "the temperature of the sample was stabilized by using a temperature controller with a calibrated si diode sensor mounted near the sample and a heating element attached to the cold finger of the cryostat .    at far infrared frequencies the real part of the optical conductivity , @xmath48 ,",

    "terahertz measurements on a lsmo sample@xcite confirm that @xmath60 is a valid approximation in the regime of interest @xmath61 .    at higher frequencies , the optical properties of the samples in the infrared - uv range are derived from the measured transmittance and reflectance by numerically inverting the fresnel formulae for a thin film on a weakly absorbing thick substrate .",
    "the interference ( etalon ) effects from the substrate are averaged by using low spectral resolution in the measurement and by averaging over the interference fringes in the analysis.@xcite this procedure yields the index of refraction and extinction coefficient of the thin - film material , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , using @xmath57 and @xmath64 for the substrate .",
    "the results of @xmath65 and @xmath63 are then used to derive the other optical constants such as the dielectric function , @xmath66 , or the optical conductivity .@xcite since this technique does not rely on kramers - kronig analysis it permits reliable measurement of the optical conductivity up to the high frequency cut off of the optical equipment @xmath67 ev@xmath68 .",
    "this analysis assumes that the index of refraction , @xmath57 , and @xmath64 of the substrate are known quantities . in all",
    "the substrate samples that we measured , we found the index to be roughly constant , @xmath69 , and sample independent in the 0.2@xmath215 ev range.@xcite although the values for the extinction coefficient were small in this same range ( @xmath70 ) , we found some variation in @xmath64 for different samples of laalo@xmath2 especially near the cutoff frequency of 0.2 ev .",
    "the differences are sufficiently large that it is necessary to use the values for @xmath57 and @xmath64 for the substrate on which the film was grown in the analysis since the effect of @xmath64 in the substrate is similar to the effect of @xmath71 in the sample ( @xmath72% ) .",
    "therefore , after the film was measured , it was removed from the substrate and the transmittance and reflectance of the bare substrate were measured .",
    "this procedure ensured that the proper values of @xmath57 and @xmath64 for the substrate were used in the final inversion of the data .",
    "the optical conductivity in the far infrared was estimated as described in section ii - b .",
    "because of the narrow range of the transmission window of the laalo@xmath2 substrates and the featureless transmissivity from 20 @xmath21 100 @xmath73 these data provide only a low frequency data point to our broad band conductivity spectra shown in fig .",
    "it is interesting to compare this far infrared conductivity with the dc conductivity of the same films .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays a comparison of the measured dc conductivity and the derived conductivities at 20 @xmath74 using eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) .",
    "we noticed a reasonable agreement between the ac and dc values for lcmo and nsmo samples .",
    "however , a striking disagreement is found for the lsmo sample .",
    "the measured dc conductivity in this sample is roughly 10 times larger than the ac values obtained at 20 @xmath74 .",
    "similar results have been observed in another high conductivity lsmo film .",
    "however , typical lsmo films have a resistivity of around 100 @xmath42 in better agreement with the ac values . the observed discrepancy for the high conductivity films",
    "is particularly significant when it is recalled that the far infrared ac conductivity derived from eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) is an upper limit of the true value .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy is not a consequence of granularity in the film since this effect would lead to an effective dc resistivity larger than the intrinsic value due to the higher resistivity of the grain boundaries .",
    "we believe that the observed behavior may be explained in terms of an anisotropic conductivity arising from strain effects in the films .",
    "such effects may be expected in materials with a strong coupling between the electrons and the lattice as we are reporting in this paper .",
    "further studies of these effects are in progress .    the results of the real part of the optical conductivity , , for the three samples measured at different temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "the symbols near zero frequency are obtained from the far - infrared transmittance measurements as described above .",
    "the ir conductivity is seen to extrapolate reasonably to the far infrared value except for a downturn near the low frequency ir cutoff .",
    "this effect is believed to be related to the difficulties in characterizing the differences in the extinction coefficient of the substrates near the ir cutoff as discussed earlier .",
    "therefore we do not trust the data below about 0.3 ev . in the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we find that near and above @xmath3 , the optical conductivity for the three samples is dominated by a broad maximum near 1 ev with a peak value of roughly 600@xmath21700 @xmath75@xmath74 , only slightly higher than the mott conductivity .",
    "we also notice that the feature near 1 ev evolves in temperature in very much the same way for the different alloys .",
    "these data indicate that this feature is universal in the hole doped pseudo - cubic manganites . in all the samples ,",
    "the broad maximum in the conductivity spectrum above @xmath3 moves to lower frequencies and grows in oscillator strength as temperature is decreased through @xmath3 .",
    "the peak structure remains identifiable well below @xmath3 , but as the temperature is lowered further into the metallic range the low frequency part fills in and eventually increases with decreasing frequency for @xmath76 .",
    "this indicates a drude response and coherent conduction at low temperatures and low frequencies in all the samples .",
    "the results for the new oxygen annealed nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath77  sample differ from the results on an unannealed sample , reported previously , which did not show a drude - like response even at the lowest temperature , although the @xmath78 behavior was similar to that observed here .",
    "the earlier sample had a lower @xmath3  and a much higher dc resistivity @xmath79 than the present sample even at the lowest @xmath80 and similar to values generally reported in the literature on nsmo .",
    "clearly , the different oxygen treatment of the two samples produced different behaviors in their dc transport and optical properties .    throughout the infrared the reflectance and transmittance of the films",
    "is dominated by @xmath71 and is relatively insensitive to @xmath81",
    ". therefore our results @xmath81 are less reliable . nevertheless , we find that @xmath81 remains positive down to at least 0.5 ev despite the apparent free - carrier response of at low temperature , which would be expected to produce a negative @xmath81 characteristic of a metal .",
    "the observed behavior is not completely unexpected since interband transitions between the two @xmath17bands are expected in this spectral range .",
    "nevertheless , this behavior indicates that the spectral weight of the coherent component of the conductivity is only a small fraction of the total spectral weight in all these samples as has been reported in refs .",
    "the other major spectral feature in the optical data is the strong peak in the conductivity near 4 ev . the noisy appearance of the conductivity data near the peak of this feature is a consequence of the very small transmittance of the films due to the strong absorption at the peak .",
    "also , this feature appears noticeably weaker in nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "in this section we discuss in more detail several of the striking features of the optical conductivity data shown in fig .",
    "there are three main peaks : at @xmath82 ev , 3 ev , and 4 ev . a qualitative picture of the states and optical transitions is shown in fig .",
    "the important orbitals are the mn @xmath12 and o@xmath32 levels .",
    "optical absorption is controlled by the electric dipole matrix element and allowed transitions involve motion of a charge either from one mn - site to another or from an o to a mn . ref .  [ ]",
    "argues that transitions from one @xmath83 orbital to another one _ on the same site _ appear in the optical spectrum , but we believe these transitions have negligible oscillator strength because both the initial and the final states have d - symmetry with respect to the same origin .",
    "there are several important energies .",
    "one is the @xmath84 charge transfer energy @xmath85 .",
    "another is the jahn - teller energy @xmath86 : if a mn site has one @xmath12 electron then a local even - parity lattice distortion which breaks cubic symmetry may occur ; this splits the @xmath12 levels by an amount @xmath86 .",
    "a third is the breathing distortion energy @xmath87 : at an mn - site with no @xmath12 electrons a symmetric `` breathing '' distortion of the surrounding oxygens may occur : if ( as occurs in an optical transition ) an @xmath12 electron is added on a timescale which is fast compared to a phonon frequency ( so the lattice does not have time to relax ) the final state is shifted up in energy by @xmath87 . in lcmo with @xmath88 ,",
    "the low temperature phase is charge ordered and both breathing and jahn - teller distortions occur.@xcite the amplitudes of these distortions are approximately equal , suggesting @xmath89 .",
    "a fourth energy is the `` hubbard @xmath90 '' repulsion@xcite between two @xmath12 electrons on the same site .",
    "as will be discussed below , available evidence suggests that the effective @xmath90 describing the low ( @xmath91 ev ) energy physics of the @xmath18 band is weak .",
    "a final energy is the hund s coupling @xmath92 : each mn has a @xmath93 t@xmath94 core spin ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) ; any @xmath12 electrons may have spin parallel or antiparallel to the core spin ; the `` antiparallel '' state is higher by an energy @xmath92 .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we shall argue that the 1 ev feature involves @xmath95 transitions within the parallel spin manifold ; the 3 ev feature is due to @xmath95 transitions in which the final state is antiparallel and the 4 ev feature is the @xmath96o@xmath32 transition .",
    "the most striking feature of the data in this energy range is the broad peak centered at @xmath97 ev ( @xmath98 ev in the lcmo and nsmo samples , and perhaps at a somewhat lower energy in lsmo ) , which is evident in the paramagnetic phase in all samples and which , as @xmath80 is decreased below the magnetic @xmath3 , loses intensity and shifts to lower frequency , eventually evolving into the drude - like response observed at very low temperatures .",
    "this feature was first observed by okimoto @xmath22@xcite and was interpreted by them as the `` parallel '' to `` antiparallel '' transition , implying a @xmath99 ev .",
    "however , as noted by millis @xmath22@xcite the temperature dependence of the spectral weight of the 1 ev feature is inconsistent with this interpretation .",
    "because the electric dipole matrix element preserves spin , the `` antiparallel '' final state is inaccessible if the material is in the fully polarized ferromagnetic ground state , so the oscillator strength in the `` antiparallel '' transition should decrease as @xmath80 is lowered below @xmath29 .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the intensity in the peak feature grows as @xmath80 is decreased below @xmath3 , even as the feature broadens and shifts to lower energies , inconsistent with the `` antiparallel '' interpretation .",
    "we , therefore , believe it involves parallel spin @xmath100 transitions only . however , the temperature dependence of @xmath101 near @xmath102 ev is consistent with transitions to an @xmath18 `` antiparallel '' final state . as can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which displays the difference [ @xmath103 , a peak at @xmath104 ev grows in strength as the temperature is raised and the core spins are disordered .",
    "returning now to the 1 ev feature , we ascribe it to @xmath100 transitions . as will be discussed in detail in the next section ,",
    "the oscillator strength is consistent with that expected for dipole allowed d@xmath21d charge transfer transitions between mn ions on different sites .",
    "the insulating nature of the paramagnetic phase and the peak - like shape of the absorption suggests that it arises from excitation of carriers out of bound states .",
    "one possibility is localization due to disorder , as suggested by ref .",
    "[ ] . we think this is unlikely because of the universal appearance of the feature in manganites of widely varying dc conductivities.@xcite as noted by jung @xmath22@xcite the characteristic energy of the absorption feature in the paramagnetic state of the doped materials is similar to that observed in insulating lamno@xmath2 , where a @xmath105 ev gap appears in the @xmath12 manifold due to the presence of a long range ordered jahn - teller distortion . in lamno@xmath2 this feature is believed to be due to the @xmath100 transition shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ; the gap of 1.5 ev corresponds to a band - center to band - center energy difference of about 2.5 ev and we identify this energy as @xmath106 for lamno@xmath2 .",
    "doped materials in the paramagnetic phase were predicted @xcite to have lattice distortions similar to those occurring in lamno@xmath107 ( but without the long ranged order ) and these distortions ( with amplitude about 70% of those in lamno@xmath107 ) have recently been directly observed in neutron pdf@xcite and exafs@xcite experiments .",
    "we , therefore , interpret the 1 ev feature observed at @xmath108 in our doped samples as being due to the excitation of a carrier out of a bound state produced by a strong local lattice distortion ( and into a final state also modified by the lattice distortions ) .",
    "of course , in doped materials the @xmath109 electron concentration is less than 1 per site , so transitions such as those shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are also possible .",
    "the fact that only one ( broad ) feature is observed suggests that the energy shift due to the breathing distortion , @xmath110 , is comparable to the jahn - teller plus coulomb energy @xmath106 .",
    "as the temperature is decreased below @xmath3 , the 1 ev feature grows in intensity and broadens , and eventually evolves into the drude - like response observed at very low temperatures .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the collapse of the jahn - teller small polaron as the system goes into the ferromagnetic state .",
    "it can be understood in terms of a model proposed by millis , mueller and shraiman@xcite that incorporates double exchange and dynamic jt effects in the system . in this model , the behavior of the system",
    "is controlled by the dimensionless effective coupling constant @xmath111 defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the hopping probability , and @xmath114 is the relative angle between neighboring spins . the temperature dependence is controlled by the @xmath115 factor , which goes from 2/3 in the paramagnetic state to 1 in the ferromagnetic state . within this model a qualitative description of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is as follows : in the paramagnetic state @xmath111 is larger than @xmath116 , the critical value for the formation of a small polaron . as the temperature",
    "is decreased , the spins become aligned and @xmath111 decreases becoming smaller than @xmath116 leading to a collapse of the jt small polaron and coherent drude - like conduction at low temperatures . the optical conductivity calculated within this model show shifts in oscillator strength and linewidth as function of @xmath111 that compare well to the experimental results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] below 2 ev.@xcite the behavior of the resistivities , the curie temperatures and the optical properties of these materials indicate that lsmo , lcmo , and nsmo have a progressively increasing jt coupling @xmath111 .",
    "we emphasize that in all the samples the jt small polaron feature remains for intermediate temperatures below @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with thermopower and exafs measurements that also suggest evidence for small polaronic behavior in the lcmo near @xmath3.@xcite the downward shift in the polaron feature and the onset of metallic conductivity indicate a gradual transition from a small polaron to a large polaron and a corresponding gradual growth of the strength of the coherent conductivity .",
    "another aspect of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a large redistribution of spectral weight from optical transitions occurring above 2 ev to below the 1 ev feature discussed above .",
    "the temperature dependence of  is seen to extend up to the upper limit of our measurements ( 5 ev ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the origins of the two major spectral features in this range .",
    "the first one is the strong absorption at @xmath117 ev .",
    "the assignment of the optical process involved in this transition is made by comparing it with the result of the undoped parent compound lamno@xmath2 . in this material , a similar peak in the optical conductivity has been observed at this frequency and assigned to a charge transfer transition between the o@xmath32 and the @xmath12 derived bands.@xcite the @xmath80-dependence of the 4 ev feature does not , however , account for the missing spectral weight when the sample is warmed above @xmath29 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . to fully account for all the low - frequency oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic state it is clear that it will be necessary to include contributions up to and beyond the 5 ev limit of our measurements .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spectral weight will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "this section presents a more quantitative comparison of data to theory .",
    "the main results are : ( i ) the @xmath12 electron kinetic energy is largest ( and effective electron - phonon interaction weakest ) in lsmo , while the kinetic energy is smallest ( and electron - phonon interaction strongest ) in nsmo , with lcmo being intermediate .",
    "( ii ) in all compounds at lowest temperature the @xmath18 kinetic energy is greater than or approximately equal to the band theory value , suggesting that at this temperature the effects of the electron - phonon and electron - electron interaction are relatively weak .",
    "( iii ) the change in @xmath12 kinetic energy between lowest temperature and @xmath3 is too large to be consistent with models involving only double exchange , but is consistent with theories based on the interplay of double exchange and electron - phonon coupling . ( iv )",
    "there is a reasonable consistency between the optical estimates of the electron kinetic energy and the observed low temperature spin wave stiffness ( our analysis here generalizes and corrects statements made in ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "( v ) the magnitude of the change in optical absorption near @xmath104 ev is quantitatively consistent with the interpretation , given in the previous section , of the 3 ev peak as transitions to the `` antiparallel '' final state .    because calculations of @xmath118 including both a realistic treatment of the @xmath12 band structure and the effects of the electron - phonon interaction are not available , we focus the discussion on the spectral weight @xmath119 defined by @xmath120 it is sometimes convenient to define an effective number of electrons per unit cell n@xmath121 and a kinetic energy k@xmath122 ) via @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the unit cell volume and @xmath126 . if the integral in eq .",
    "( [ three ] ) is carried out to @xmath127 the familiar f - sum rule implies one obtains n@xmath128 , the total number , core plus valence of electrons in the unit cell .",
    "@xmath129 gives a partial sum rule which may give information about low - lying states of interest .",
    "for the manganites the low - lying states of interest are the @xmath12 electrons ; in the analysis which follows we will first present some theoretical results , then determine an @xmath130 such that @xmath119 is a good estimate of the spectral weight in the @xmath131 transitions and finally use the magnitude and temperature dependence of the determined spectral weight to infer the results listed above .",

    "the analysis suggests that at low @xmath80 any renormalizations of the kinetic energy due to electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions are small .",

    "we believe that these conclusions , which have been verified in the noninteracting limit , apply also to interacting models .",
    "we therefore analyze the @xmath78 data by comparing the parallel spin spectral weight to the @xmath179 calculations and the `` antiparallel '' weight to @xmath180 the parallel weight .",

    "models involving the interplay of double - exchange and electron - phonon coupling can produce a larger @xmath184 because of a feedback effect : decreasing k@xmath185 by increasing spin disorder increases the effective electron - phonon coupling which decreases k@xmath185 still further . in ref .",
    "[ ] weak , intermediate , and strong electron - phonon couplings were distinguished .",
    "the intermediate coupling regime was argued to be relevant to cmr ; in this regime the phonon renormalization of the kinetic energy is small at low @xmath80 ( where the behavior is metallic ) but significant at high @xmath80 ( where the interaction has localized the electrons ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath186 .",
    "table i presents the measured values of k@xmath187 obtained by integrating the observed conductivity up to @xmath188 ev .",
    "these values lead to @xmath189 , in good agreement with theory .",
    "further , the observed magnitude of @xmath190 supports the correctness of our estimate for k@xmath183 .",
    "if the band theory estimate k@xmath191 ev were correct , then in lsmo , the observed change in spectral weight would be 70% of the total .",
    "such a large change seems very unlikely .",
    "finally , we turn to the `` antiparallel '' absorption . taking the 3 ev feature in fig .",

    "the parallel spectral weights k@xmath193 also shown in table [ table1 ] are obtained as before by integrating up to 2.7 ev .",
    "this leads to ratios of the `` antiparallel '' to the `` parallel '' spin absorptions of about 1/3 , in reasonable accord with the theoretical estimates .",
    "we now turn to the spin - wave dispersion which at small @xmath194 has the form @xmath195 .",
    "the value of @xmath196 is of interest because in double - exchange materials the spin stiffness is related to the amplitude for conduction electrons to hop from one site to the next , and as we have seen this is given by the conduction - band optical spectral weight .",
    "one therefore expects a relation between the optical spectral weight and the spin wave stiffness . to derive this relation ship more precisely , we consider the energy cost @xmath197 of imposing a static distortion of wavevector @xmath194 .",
