    "let @xmath1 be an oval , i.e. , a planar , closed , regular , simple , oriented counterclockwise , @xmath2 curve , @xmath3 , parameterized by @xmath4 and such that its radius of curvature @xmath5 .",
    "the billiard problem on @xmath1 consists in the free motion of a point particle on the planar region enclosed by @xmath1 , being reflected elastically at the impacts on the boundary .",
    "the trajectories will be polygonals on this planar region .",
    "since the motion is free inside the region , it is completely determined by the points of impacts at @xmath1 , and the direction of motion immediately after each reflection , defined by the angle @xmath6 between it and the oriented tangent to the boundary at the reflection point .",
    "therefor , to each oval @xmath1 is associated a billiard map @xmath7 from the cylinder @xmath8 into itself which to each initial condition @xmath9 associates the next impact and direction : @xmath10 .",
    "the map @xmath7 has some very well known properties ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : it is a @xmath11-diffeomorphism , preserving the measure @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the arclength parameter for @xmath1 .",
    "it is reversible with respect to the reversing symmetry @xmath14 , which satisfies @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is a monotone twist map .",
    "so , the billiard map defines a discrete reversible conservative bidimensional dynamical system in the cylinder @xmath8 .",
    "this map has no fixed points but birkhoff @xcite proved that it has periodic orbits of any period greater or equal to 2 .    in this paper",
    "we show that , under certain generic conditions , billiards on ovals have only a finite number of periodic orbits , for each period @xmath0 , all non - degenerate and at least one of them is hyperbolic .",
    "moreover , the invariant curves of two hyperbolic points are transversal .",
    "the generic existence , in the analytic case , of at least one nondegenerate periodic orbit for each period , was proved by kozlov and treschev @xcite .",
    "our results generalize theirs in the sense that we work with curves at least @xmath17 , prove the finiteness and study the heteroclinic connections .",
    "once we have a hyperbolic periodic orbit , which unstable manifold project to @xmath18 , we can construct the instability region associated to it from the closure of the invariant manifold .",
    "the dynamical object we obtain is the same as the one constructed by le calvez in @xcite and thus shares the same dynamical properties .",
    "billiard maps are a special kind of diffeomorphisms and @xmath19 perturbations of the map may produce diffeomorphisms which are not billiards . in order to assure that the perturbed diffeomorphism remains a billiard , we have to perturb the boundary curve instead of the map itself .",

    "let then , @xmath322 be the smallest cylinder containing @xmath317 . since @xmath323 is also a cylinder and @xmath324 , @xmath325 , and we have that @xmath326 .",
    "so , @xmath327 is also a cylinder containing @xmath317 . and",
    "as @xmath328 is the smallest cylinder , we must have @xmath329 .",
    "however , @xmath45 is area - preserving , so we conclude that @xmath330 , i.e , @xmath328 is an invariant cylinder .    as @xmath45 is a diffeomorphism , @xmath331 and @xmath332 . from birkhoff",
    "s theorem it follows that @xmath333 is the union of two rotational invariant curves @xmath100 and @xmath130 .",
    "in fact , these two curves @xmath100 and @xmath130 are contained in @xmath317 . to prove this fact ,",
    "let us suppose that there is a point @xmath334 .",
    "then there is an open ball @xmath43 , centered at @xmath335 such that @xmath336 .",
    "we can then construct a new cylinder @xmath337 with @xmath338 where @xmath339 outside @xmath340 and @xmath341 otherwise .",
    "we have then a new cylinder satisfying @xmath342 and so @xmath328 is not the smallest one , which is a contradiction .",
    "now , as @xmath305 is the union of continuous curves , its closure contains the boundaries @xmath100 and @xmath130 and @xmath307 for every @xmath257 rotational and invariant , it follows that there is no invariant curve in @xmath343 .",
    "we have proved that @xmath328 is an invariant cylinder , its boundaries are rotational invariant curves and there are no other rotational invariant curves inside it .",
    "so , it is the instability region containing @xmath317 .",
    "suppose now that there is no invariant rotational curves curves bounding @xmath305 from bellow , i.e , @xmath344 for all rotational invariant curves @xmath259 .",
    "we can extend @xmath7 continuously to the circle @xmath255 , observing that @xmath345 .",
    "now , any cylinder with boundaries @xmath346 and a rotational invariant curve contains @xmath317 .",
    "the smallest one , @xmath328 , will have boundaries @xmath346 and @xmath130 , because if there were a new boundary @xmath100 then it will be a rotational invariant curve with @xmath347 .",
    "reasoning as above we conclude that @xmath328 is the instability region that contains @xmath317 .",
    "the case @xmath348 for all rotational invariant curves follows from the reversibility property of @xmath7 .",
    "finally , if @xmath45 has no rotational invariant curves , the instability region containing @xmath317 is the entire cylinder @xmath349 $ ] .",
    "obviously , we can make a similar construction and obtain the same result for the stable manifold @xmath306 .",
    "[ prop : ilha ] let @xmath350 be the complement of @xmath317 in the instability region @xmath328",
    ". then @xmath351 , where all the @xmath352 s are disjoint open sets , homeomorphic to discs .",
    "dynamically , each @xmath352 returns over itself .",
    "@xmath350 is open and is the union of its disjoint open connected components .",
    "let @xmath353 be one of them .",
    "@xmath353 can not divide @xmath328 into two disjoint sets because @xmath354 contains @xmath305 , which projects over @xmath258 and converges to the two rotational curves of @xmath333 .",
    "so @xmath353 is homotopically trivial .    as @xmath355 $ ] has finite area and each connected component has positive area .",
    "so there can not exist a non countable number of them .    clearly , @xmath356 . as @xmath45 is area preserving then ,",
    "given @xmath352 , there exists a smallest @xmath357 such that @xmath358 .",
    "but , as each @xmath352 is a connected component @xmath350 , we must have @xmath359 . in other words ,",
    "each component @xmath352 of @xmath360 is periodic .",
    "the above proposition suggests the definition    given @xmath211 , let @xmath357 be the smallest integer such that @xmath359 .",
    "we call @xmath352 an island of stability and @xmath357 its period",
    ". the invariant set @xmath361 will be called an archipel .",
    "remark that , as each island @xmath352 is invariant by @xmath362 and homeomorphic to a ball then    the boundary @xmath363 is a closed connected set , with empty interior , contained in @xmath317 and invariant by @xmath362 .",
    "an easy consequence of proposition [ prop : ilha ] is    every periodic point in an island of stability has a period multiple of the period of the island .",
    "more strongly , we have that    each island of stability contains a periodic point with the same period as the island .",
    "let @xmath352 be an island of stability with period @xmath357 .",
    "since the restriction @xmath364 is area preserving and conjugated to a diffeomorphism of the plane which is orientation preserving , it follows from brouwer s translation theorem that @xmath364 has a fixed point .",
    "so there exists a point @xmath365 such that @xmath366 and so a periodic orbit @xmath367 with the smallest possible period .",
    "remark that , as billiards have no fixed points then @xmath368 and @xmath369 .",
    "all points in an island of stability have the same rational rotation type .",
    "[ prop : rotnum ]    let , as above , @xmath352 be an island of stability with period @xmath357 . following @xcite we observe that if @xmath370 is the lift of @xmath352 to the universal cover and @xmath371 is a lift of @xmath7 , then there exists an integer @xmath169 such that @xmath372 .",
    "since @xmath370 is bounded , this implies that that for all @xmath373 if @xmath374 denotes a lift of @xmath375 , then there exists @xmath376 , where @xmath377 is the projetion on the first factor .      for the sake of completeness , we conclude by describing some well known dynamical consequences of the area preserving and the twist properties .",
    "let @xmath7 be generic , in the sense of the previous sections , and @xmath304 be a hyperbolic periodic orbit such that its unstable manifold @xmath305 satisfies @xmath316 .",
    "let @xmath328 be the instability region containing @xmath317 .",
    "following the terminology of franks in @xcite we call @xmath378 the instability set .    clearly , the instability set @xmath354 does not contain any moser stable periodic orbit , since they have open islands around them . for hyperbolic periodic orbits we have    let @xmath379 be a hyperbolic periodic orbit in @xmath354 and let @xmath380 and @xmath381 be its invariant stable and unstable manifolds . then either @xmath382 and @xmath383 or @xmath384 , ie , the boundary of an island . moreover , for @xmath385 or @xmath386 , if @xmath387 and @xmath388 then @xmath389 ; or if @xmath384 then two branches of the invariant curves of @xmath390 and/or @xmath391 are contained in @xmath363 .",
    "suppose that there exists @xmath392 such that @xmath393 , @xmath394 .",
    "then by lemma 3.1 of @xcite , the branch of @xmath395 which contains @xmath375 is entirely contained in @xmath378 .",
    "so if each branch of @xmath395 intersects @xmath378 then @xmath396 and obviously , @xmath397 .",
    "let us now suppose that a branch @xmath257 of @xmath395 is not in @xmath378 .",
    "then @xmath257 is contained in an island of stability @xmath352 or is outside the region of instability @xmath328 . as the @xmath398-limit of @xmath257 is @xmath399 , either @xmath384 or @xmath400 or @xmath130 , the boundary curves of @xmath328 .",
    "but this last case is impossible in the generic case .",
    "so @xmath384 .",
    "but in this case , it is enough to remark that @xmath363 is an invariant closed connected set and that the only sets with these properties containing @xmath399 are the invariant manifolds to conclude that two branches of the invariant curves of @xmath390 and/or @xmath391 are contained in @xmath363 .    if @xmath388 then @xmath401 and , by theorem [ teo : inst ] , @xmath389 .",
    "concerning non - periodic orbits and as a consequence of proposition [ prop : rotnum ] we have that    any aubry- mather set of irrational type contained in @xmath328 is actually contained in the instability set @xmath378 .    and",
    "as it was proven by le calvez @xcite the instability set @xmath378 contains the closure of the orbits which @xmath1 and/or @xmath402-limits are @xmath100 and @xmath130 .",
    "so far we have obtained a rough description of the dynamics in the instability region , very similar to what hapens for generic area preserving twist maps .",
    "it is made of the closure of an hyperbolic orbit and the union of periodic islands .    in order to proceed with this description",
    "it is necessary to address two basic related themes . the first one has to do with the islands : the existence of a finite number of them , the existence of a lower bound for the period of an island ( e.g. there are examples with no period two islands ) and the existence of connecting orbits between the boundaries of the islands .",
    "a very interesting question is if it is possible to have an instability region without any islands .",
    "a starting point is the instability region that contains the period two orbits . in this region ,",
    "the reversibility symmetry of the phase space , together with geometric properties of the boundary of the billiard may allow us to obtain new results about the above questions .",
