    "* quantum fisher information . *",
    "we start with a brief introduction of qfi and give a useful form of qfi for a special kind of mixed qudit states , which usually represents the output states of qudit cloning .",
    "recall that qfi of parameter @xmath3 encoded in @xmath0-dimensional quantum state @xmath4 is generally defined as^@xcite^ @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the so - called symmetric logarithmic derivative , which is defined by @xmath7 with @xmath8 . by diagonalizing the matrix as @xmath9",
    ", one can rewritten the qfi as^@xcite^ @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the qfi for pure state @xmath12 with the form @xmath13.\\ ] ] note that eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) suggests the qfi of a non - full - rank state is only determined by the subset of @xmath14 with nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "physically , the qfi can be divided into three parts^@xcite^. the first term is just the classical fisher information determined by the probability distribution ; the second term is a weighted average over the qfi for all the nonzero eigenstates ; the last term stemming from the mixture of pure states reduces the qfi and hence the estimation precision below the pure - state case . though the eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) is powerful , there is no explicit expression for an arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional mixed state .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the output reduced states of uqcm and pqcm all have a form as @xmath15 which is completely characterized by a parameter independent shrinking factor @xmath16 and the dimensionality @xmath0",
    ". here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the input state and @xmath0-dimensional identity matrix , respectively .",
    "although @xmath19 has such a simple form , an analytical expression of qfi is still difficult to achieve .",
    "fortunately , if we restrict our discussions to the special case of input states in the form @xmath20 could be given by ( see methods ) @xmath21    the above equation is a key mathematical tool for our analysis of this paper .",
    "although this expression only holds for the combination of eqs .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) , it is powerful since the scaling form of @xmath19 is usually satisfied in quantum cloning machines or in the case of a pure state under white noises . on the other hand ,",
    "the equatorial states are widely employed in the physical implementations of quantum communication ideas ( such as bb84 protocol^@xcite^ ) as well as in the demonstration of fundamental questions in quantum information processing . after a simple calculation",
    ", we find that @xmath22 is a monotonically increasing function of the shrinking factor @xmath16 .",
    "this is to be expected because the larger @xmath16 indicates more information the reduced output state @xmath19 contains about the relevant parameter .",
    "* distributability . * before moving to the discussion of distribution , a proper measure that quantify the distributability of cloning machines should be well defined .",
    "note that one can define the distributability in different ways which depends on what is distributed in the procedure .",
    "for example , it can be defined from the perspectives of fidelity which quantifies the total information of the state , and qfi which quantifies the information of particular parameters in the state .",
    "it is well known that , unlike the symmetric cloning in which all the copies are the same , the outputs of asymmetric cloning are nonidentical .",
    "hence , the optimality of asymmetric cloning can be judged by maximizing the sum of all copies fidelities , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . intuitively , when we consider the distribution of quantum states , the distributability of asymmetric cloning can be defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fidelity between the original and the @xmath25th copy .",
    "namely , the larger @xmath26 indicates the better capability of distribution on the quantum states .    in a seminal work^@xcite^",
    ", the authors pointed that both fidelity and qfi are highly related to the distinguishability of the states , which is measured by bures distance^@xcite^. therefore , from the perspective of qfi , the measure @xmath27 also qualifies the capability of distributing information of relevant parameter encoded in the input state , where @xmath28 denotes the qfi of parameter @xmath3 in the @xmath25th copy . in the following discussions , we will use the definitions ( [ e06 ] ) and ( [ e07 ] ) to quantify the distributabilities of fidelity and qfi respectively in asymmetric cloning machines .    * qfi distribution for 2-dimensional cloning . *",
    "as we mentioned above , one is particularly interested in the asymmetric cloning machines which produce two copies with different qualities within the framework of quantum cryptography .",
    "two typical asymmetric cloning machines are asymmetric uqcm^@xcite^ , which clones all input states equally well , and asymmetric pqcm^@xcite^ , which works equally well only for equatorial input states with the form of eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "we first discuss the 2-dimensional cloning by obtaining the analytical results , and then generalize it to _",
    "d_-dimensional cloning by the assistance of numerical simulations .",
    "* asymmetric 2-dimensional uqcm . *",
    "the @xmath29 optimal asymmetric uqcm was independently proposed by niu and griffiths^@xcite^ , buek _ _ et al__^@xcite^ and cerf^@xcite^. though their formalisms are slightly different , the results are exactly the same . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we adopt the quantum circuit approach developed by buek .",
    "the transformation of asymmetric uqcm can be written in the following form @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are real , and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath35 . with the transformation ( [ e6 ] ) in mind , it is now an easy exercise to verify that the two different copies of the original state @xmath36 are @xmath37 from the point of geometry , the asymmetric uqcm shrinks the original bloch vector by two different shrinking factors ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) regardless of its direction . as special cases , we can see that if @xmath40 , then no information has been transferred from the original system , while , if @xmath41 , then all of the information in system a has been transferred to system b. in addition , if @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , then it reduces to the symmetric uqcm case .",
    "obviously , the two shrinking factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related , and should satisfy the no - cloning inequality^@xcite^ @xmath46 which is an ellipse in the @xmath47 space .",
    "an optimal asymmetric uqcm is characterized by a point @xmath48 which lies on the boundary of this ellipse .    according to eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) , when @xmath49 , the qfi of parameter @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "immediately , the qfis are @xmath51 here and henceforth we omit the subscript @xmath52 for brevity since we restrict our discussions to the single - parameter scenario .",
    "remarkably , a trade - off relation exists for the two qfis : if one qfi is large , correspondingly another qfi will become small . combining eqs .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e10 ] ) , the trade - off relation of qfi is expressed as @xmath53 this trade - off tells us that even we only concern cloning the information of a particular parameter encoded in quantum states , two close - to - perfect copies can not be achieved simultaneously , imposed by quantum mechanics .",
    "an intuitive presentation of this trade - off relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ( dashed line ) .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the distribution of qfi in the asymmetric uqcm . as we defined in eq .",
    "( [ e07 ] ) .",
    "the distributability of qfi is measured by @xmath54 therefore , the larger @xmath55 is , the more qfi of the relevant parameter has been distributed to the two copies .",
    "we find that the asymmetric uqcm always performs better than symmetric uqcm in distributing qfi , which means @xmath56 this can be proved by the method of lagrange multiplier .",
    "one will find three extreme points : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath60 is the minimum value .      in order to show the difference of distributability between qfi and fidelity",
    ", we also write the corresponding fidelities defined as @xmath61 @xmath62 according to eq .",
    "( [ e06 ] ) , we adopt @xmath63 to qualify the capability of asymmetric uqcm in distributing the entire quantum state . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the results of asymmetric 2-dimensional uqcm .",
    "it is remarkable that , from the perspective of qfi , the asymmetric uqcm is always works better than symmetric uqcm , which is a sharp contrast to the result of fidelity^@xcite^ , where the symmetric uqcm is always optimal .",
    "* asymmetric 2-dimensional pqcm . * in the context of quantum cryptography^@xcite^ , the uqcm studied in the previous subsection might be optimal if the detail setup of qkd protocol is not specified .",
    "but it may not be optimal for the quantum states involved in a special qkd protocol . practically , it is possible that we already know a priori information of the input states .",
    "thus , a state - dependent cloning machine would perform better than uqcm .",
    "the best - known example of state - dependent cloning machine is the so - called pqcm .",
    "the symmetric pqcm was firstly proposed by bru _",
    "et al _ for the equatorial qubit state^@xcite^ and then an asymmetric version was demonstrated by niu and griffiths^@xcite^. recently , the asymmetric pqcm has been experimentally realized using nmr^@xcite^ and fiber optics^@xcite^.      previous studies suggest that the equatorial qubit state pqcm can be realized by both economic^@xcite^ and non - economic^@xcite^ transformations .",
    "one can check that both economic and non - economic methods achieve the same distributability of qfi . in the text",
    "we discuss the non - economic case as it can be directly generalized to _",
    "d_-dimensional pqcm .",
    "the transformation of asymmetric pqcm can be written in the following form @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is the normalization condition .",
    "@xmath68 is a set of orthogonal normalized ancillary state . for the equatorial qubit - state @xmath36 ,",
    "the output states have the form as @xmath69 then , the shrinking factors are @xmath70 . using the normalization condition ,",
    "the shrinking factors can be simplified as @xmath71 as is seen , in the scenario of asymmetric pqcm , there are two free parameters to be optimized .",
    "therefore , an optimal asymmetric pqcm is defined as the following : if we fix the quality of one copy , then the other copy is optimal with the highest quality . from the eqs .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) and ( [ e19 ] ) , one can eliminate @xmath34 and obtain the trade - off relation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath72 assuming @xmath44 is constant , the optimal value of @xmath73 can be found , and the optimal trade - off relation reduces to @xmath74 the corresponding qfis are @xmath75 in the symmetric case , we have @xmath76 . remarkably , according to eq .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) , one can immediately find the inequality @xmath77 the meanings of above equation are twofold .",
    "on one hand , it indicates that asymmetric pqcm performs better than asymmetric uqcm in distributing qfi by virtue of the known information .",
    "this result is essentially in agreement with that of fidelity . to be clear , we plot the trade - off relations between a s fidelity ( qfi ) and b s fidelity ( qfi ) for both asymmetric uqcm and pqcm in fig .",
    "it is evident that the lines of asymmetric pqcm are always above those of asymmetric uqcm , except for the start points and end points . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that , for the 2-dimensional pqcm , the asymmetric case is as good as the symmetric case on the capability of distributing qfi , while the later always performs better than the former with the measure of fidelity .",
    "the reason is that the fidelity @xmath78 as a function of @xmath79 is strictly concave , but the qfi @xmath80 as a function of @xmath81 is convex .",
    "this results in the sum of two fidelities and qfis achieving its maximal and minimal value , respectively , in the symmetric case .",
    "* qfi distribution for _ d_-dimensional cloning .",
    "* until now , we have restricted our discussions to the 2-dimensional cloning .",
    "although all quantum information tasks can be performed by using only two - level systems , it has been recently recognized that higher - dimensional quantum states ( i.e. , qudits ) can offer significant advantages for improving the security of quantum cryptographic protocols^@xcite^ , achieving higher information - density coding^@xcite^ and reducing the required resources for quantum computation and simulation^@xcite^.    based on these considerations , it would be essential to extend above discussions to _ d_-dimensional cloning .",
    "one may think the results will be trivial and analogous conclusions will be obtained as well as the 2-dimensional cloning . however , as we will show below , there are some similarities between them , but more importantly , significant differences will appear with increasing dimensionality @xmath0 .    *",
    "asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional uqcm .",
    "* the optimal asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional uqcm was proposed by cerf^@xcite^ and braunstein _ _ et al__^@xcite^. for a @xmath0-dimensional quantum system , the corresponding asymmetric uqcm can be generalized directly from the transformation ( [ e6 ] ) with @xmath82 and @xmath83 instead defined in higher - dimension , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "hence , the normalization condition now reads @xmath86 .",
    "the output reduced density matrices are written in the form of eq . ( [ e3 ] )",
    "@xmath87 with shrinking factors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath88 , we recover the results of symmetric uqcm .",
    "similarly , we can obtain a trade - off relation between two shrinking factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath89 which corresponds to a set of ellipses in the space of shrinking factors that their eccentricities vary with dimensionality .",
    "it should be noted that in the infinite dimensional case , the corresponding ellipse shrinks to the line @xmath90 .",
    "now we turn to the calculation of qfi . assuming the input state is a @xmath0-dimensional equatorial state , then the qfis of output states ( [ e23 ] ) and ( [ e24 ] ) are obtained directly by ( [ e5 ] ) . @xmath91 the tradeoff relation between @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be derived by substituting @xmath94 into ( [ e25 ] ) with @xmath95 , but it is too complicated to present in the text .",
    "nevertheless , there is no doubt that one can not gain , at the same time , two copies whose qfis are above values allowed by the trade - off relation .",

    "[ fig3]a , we find the sum of two fidelities still reaches its largest value at the point of @xmath98 , which means , by the measure of fidelity , the symmetric uqcm will optimally copy the state regardless of the dimension^@xcite^. however , fig .",
    "[ fig3]b shows that the distributability of qfi achieves its smallest value at the point of @xmath99 when @xmath100 , while it is interesting to note that the point of @xmath99 becomes a local maximum point when @xmath97 .",
    "namely , the asymmetric uqcm is no longer always better than symmetric uqcm with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that even though qfi is a monotonically function of the shrinking factor , it is not a linear function of it .",
    "this sophisticated relation between @xmath55 and @xmath16 reveals above interesting results .    naturally , we start wondering when the asymmetric uqcm may become worse than symmetric uqcm .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that when @xmath1 , the @xmath44 of global minimal @xmath55 is equal to the symmetric case . while a bifurcation appears at @xmath101 , which means @xmath102 is no longer the global point of minimal @xmath55 , as shown in fig .",
    "mathematically , we can understand the bifurcation as follows : @xmath55 as a function of @xmath44 has three extreme points which are physically allowed when @xmath1 , and @xmath99 is the point of global minima . when @xmath2 , it has five extreme points , as seen from the insertion in fig .",
    "moreover , @xmath99 is no longer the global minima but a local maximum point .",
    "thus , the symmetric uqcm may outperform the asymmetric case .",
    "however , it is hard to understand why the critical point is @xmath101 in physical , we conjecture this critical point is related to the hilbert space structure of qudits . we leave this as an open question and the further study is underway .",
    "* asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional pqcm . *",
    "the generalization of asymmetric pqcm to @xmath0-dimensional is much more difficult , and in particular , it is too complicated to present an analytical trade - off relation between two copies .",
    "however , with the aid of numerical simulations , we can confirm two main results about the distribution of qfi in asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional pqcm : ( i ) pqcm gains an advantage over uqcm by utilizing the priori information , and ( ii ) a sudden change of the point of minimum also exists in asymmetric pqcm with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the cloning transformation of asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional pqcm can be introduced^@xcite^ @xmath104 with the normalization condition @xmath105 . given the input state in the form of ( [ e4 ] ) , then , the shrinking factors of the output copies read as @xmath106 where we have use the normalization condition to eliminate the parameter @xmath107 . similar to the 2-dimensional case , here we again need to optimize two free tuning parameters .",
    "therefore , in the same way , an optimal asymmetric pqcm is defined by optimizing @xmath45 as large as possible when @xmath44 is fixed , and vice versa . by eliminating the parameter @xmath34 ,",
    "we can obtain the trade - off relation ( not the optimal one ) @xmath108\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{\\eta_{a}-(d-2)a^2}{a}\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\big(\\frac{\\eta_{a}-(d-2)a^2}{2a}\\big)^2}{d-1}-a^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the optimal trade - off relation need to be further optimized by choosing a proper value of @xmath109 to make the largest @xmath45 .",
    "unfortunately , there is not a closed analytical form of @xmath109 for any dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "however , by simple numerical simulations , we find that asymmetric pqcm indeed always performs better than asymmetric uqcm in distributing qfi as shown in fig .",
    "when the dimensionality _ d _ is large ( e.g. , @xmath110 ) , it should be noted that the advantage of pqcm over uqcm almost disappears .",
    "moreover , similar to the case of asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional uqcm , the asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional pqcm is not always better than the symmetric case for any dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig5]b shows that a bifurcation of the point of global minimum also occurs at @xmath101 .",

    "( i ) the answer is yes . it is definite that improving the qfi in one copy results in decreasing the qfi of the other copy , and the trade - off relation can be obtained analytically except for the asymmetric @xmath0-dimensional pqcm .",
    "( ii ) the answer is also yes . thanks to a priori knowledge of the input states , pqcm always performs better than uqcm in distributing qfi .",
    "( iii ) the answer is not so straightforward .",
    "it should be divided into two categories : for 2-dimensional cloning , asymmetric cloning always outperforms symmetric cloning on the distribution of qfi ; while for the _ d_-dimensional cloning case , the above conclusion only holds when @xmath1 and becomes invalid when @xmath2 , i.e. , the asymmetric cloning is not always better than symmetric cloning for any dimensionality .",
    "( iv ) the most significant difference between fidelity and qfi is that fidelity is a linear function of the shrinking factor while qfi is nonlinear .",
    "this leads to the counterintuitive result that symmetric cloning is always optimal from the perspective of fidelity , but asymmetric cloning usually works better than symmetric cloning on the distribution of qfi , except for some particular situations ( e.g. , when @xmath97 and @xmath114 , see the insertion in fig .
