    "in 1980 , heckman identified a class of galactic nuclei whose optical emission - line properties differ from those of classical active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and regions .",
    "these objects have narrow emission lines whose relative intensities are indicative of a relatively low ionization state of the emitting gas .",
    "heckman ( 1980 ) named these objects low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) and defined them using the ratios of the optical forbidden lines of oxygen : [ ] @xmath83727/[]@xmath85007@xmath91 and [ ] @xmath86300/[]@xmath85007@xmath90.33 . since the division is observationally motivated , any object satisfying one of the criteria and close to satisfying the other one is often called a liner . recognizing that this classification is somewhat arbitrary , heckman ( 1980 ) noted the existence of `` transition '' objects whose spectra are intermediate between those of pure liners and regions .    the original idea proposed by heckman ( 1980 ) to explain liners was that the emission lines are produced by shocks in the nucleus of the host galaxy . in fact , the optical spectrum arising from a shock - heated gas closely resembles the spectrum of liners @xcite .",
    "similar emission could be produced by turbulent mixing layers between cold and hot ism components @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the lines originate in dense gas photo - ionized by x - rays ( ferland & netzer 1983 ; halpern & steiner 1983 ) .",
    "the ionizing source can be a low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) , an idea supported by the discovery of broad emission lines ( fwhm@xmath10 km s@xmath2 ) in the spectra of many liners ( e.g. , filippenko & halpern 1984 ; ho et al .",

    "1996 ; barth et al . 1999 ; shields et al .",
    "2000 ; barth et al . 2001",
    "; eracleous & halpern 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , the source of ionizing photons could be the wolf - rayet or ob stars in a compact , young star cluster in the nucleus of the host galaxy ( terlevich & melnick 1985 ; filippenko & terlevich 1992 ; shields 1992 ; barth & shields 2000 ) .",
    "yet another possibility is that post - agb stars from an old stellar population provide the ionizing photons that power the liner - like emission lines ( binette et  al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "recent spectroscopic surveys have shown that liners are very common in local galaxies , found in at least 30% of all galaxies and 50% of early - type spirals ( see review by ho 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "since liners are so common , determining the nature of their power source is important and could have far - reaching implications . if most liners are genuine agns , they would be the most common type of agn in the local universe and would represent the faint end of the agn luminosity function . the study of liners could shed light on the evolution of agn and their host galaxies since they are likely to represent the end state of quasar evolution .",
    "it would also set a lower limit to the frequency of accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galaxies .",
    "moreover , the spectral energy distribution of liners is different from that of classical agns implying that , if they are agns , their mode of accretion might also be different @xcite .",
    "suggested accretion modes are advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) , convection - dominated accretion flows ( cdaf ; quataert & narayan 1999 ) and adiabatic inflow - outflow solutions ( adios ; blandford , & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "if liners are powered by hot stars or stellar remnants , one can ask why their spectra are different from disk regions .",
    "moreover , the presence of a central star cluster influences the chemical and dynamical evolution of the bulge of the galaxy @xcite , so the frequency of compact nuclear star clusters is of significant interest .    in view of the importance of determining the nature of the central engines of liners ,",
    "we have undertaken the analysis of a large sample of archival _ chandra _ observations of galaxies hosting liners .",
    "the x - ray morphology of the central kiloparsec of the nucleus at the angular resolution of _ chandra _ can give a first hint to the power source .",
    "an unresolved hard x - ray source at the center of the galaxy is a good indication of an agn , while a cluster of point sources and knotty diffuse emission suggests stellar phenomena .",
    "the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ and its spectroscopic capabilities also make it possible to extract the spectra of the spatially - distinct components ( point sources and diffuse emission ) to confirm their nature and to evaluate their contribution to the energy budget .",
    "this is an important issue because some liners may be powered by a combination of an agn and a starburst ( hereafter `` composites '' ; e.g. , veron et  al .",
    "1981 , moran et  al .",
    "1996 , fernandes et  al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "previous surveys with _",
    "chandra _ have studied the x - ray properties of liners with different techniques , purposes or samples than our study .",
    "terashima & wilson ( 2003 ) used snapshot observations of liners with high radio fluxes in order to search for agns and determine their properties .",
    "because of their short exposure times , they were able to detect agns with x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath11 .",
    "satyapal et al . (",
    "2005 ) and dudik et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used a combination of long and short _ chandra _ observations to assess the presence of an agn in liners and iras observations to determine the presence of star formation but they do not examine the energy bugdet of these sources .",
    "they did , however , determine that at least 50% of liners harbor a central hard x - ray source consistent with an agn .",
    "filho et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that a similar fraction of liners harbor agns by means of radio observations of 16 liners and _ chandra _ observations of 8 of them .",
    "they focused on the properties of the nucleus and argued that liners are powered by an agn , which is often undetected in the x - rays because the flux is highly absorbed .",
    "eracleous et al . (",
    "2002 ) studied three liners addressing the same questions that we address here .",
    "out of those three liners , one was powered by an agn alone and two by stellar processes alone suggesting a diversity in the nature of the ionization sources of liners . in this paper",
    "we continue and extend the work of eracleous et al .",
    "some of the objects in our sample were studied individually using the same _ chandra _ data that we use here .",
    "however , we repeat the analysis for the sake of uniformity and we add two important elements in our study : a detailed examination of the circumnuclear regions , and a careful consideration of the energy budget .",
    "the objects in our sample are unlike some of the notorious liners whose nature is clear - cut , but they are typical of the greater population of liners .",
    "in this paper we present the results and conclusions of our study , organized as follows .",
    "the sample and initial data reduction procedures are described in  [ sec : targets ] .",
    "model fits to the spectra of individual discrete sources and the average spectra of diffuse sources are described in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] . in  [ sec : populations ] we analyze the properties of the point source populations collectively and in  [ sec : individual ] , we evaluate the power source of each galaxy from the sample individually .",
    "finally , we summarize the results and discuss the implications in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we examined observations of liners in the _ chandra _ archive up to 2002 december and selected a sample of 19 galaxies hosting a pure liner or a transition object ( ho et  al .",
    "1997a ) based on their distance ( @xmath12 mpc ) and their exposure time ( @xmath13 ks ) .",
    "these selection criteria ensure good spatial resolution in the central kiloparsec of each galaxy , a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and a low detection limit ( the limiting 0.510  kev point source luminosity is in the range @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) .",
    "most ( 14 out of 19 ) of the galaxies were observed for reasons unrelated to the presence of a liner , thus the sample is largely unbiased with respect to the liner properties . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we use the distribution of liner types in our sample , to argue that it is representative of the general population of liners .",
    "the properties of the host galaxies and the exposure times are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the liner type follows the classification of ho et  al .",
    "( 1997a ) where l1 and l2 are `` pure '' liners .",
    "l1 have fairly strong narrow emission lines combined with weak broad h@xmath16 but no broad h@xmath17 while l2 have only narrow emission lines .",
    "`` transition '' objects with line ratios intermediate between those of regions and liners are referred to as t2 .",

    "( 1997a ) where they assume @xmath18  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "column  5 gives the galactic hydrogen column density ( @xmath19 ) in the direction of the center of each galaxy @xcite .",
    "ngc  1553 was not included in the ho et al .",

    "ngc  2681 , ngc  3507 , ngc  4314 , ngc  5055 and ngc  7331 are viewed approximately face - on while ngc  4111 is approximately edge - on .",
    "table  1 also includes the h@xmath16 luminosities of the target galaxies , as well as the estimated black hole masses .",
    "the h@xmath16 luminosities were taken from from ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , who measured them from spectra obtained through a @xmath20 aperture .",
    "ngc 1553 is the only exception ; its h@xmath16 luminosity was taken from phillips et al .",
    "the black hole masses were estimated from the stellar velocity dispersion using the prescription of tremaine et al .",
    "the derived black hole masses are between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with an average of @xmath23 and typical uncertainties of a factor of 2 ( or @xmath24 dex ; see discussion in barth et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "all the target galaxies were observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et  al .",
    "the nuclei of most galaxies were located near the s3 ccd aimpoint , which did not suffer significant radiation damage during the early stages of the mission . only ngc  3607 and ngc  3608 were on a different ccd : i2 and i0 respectively .",
    "the initial data screening was carried out with the ciao software package v 3.2.1 .",
    "it consisted of the selection of events with grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 and the exclusion of events occurring during times of poor aspect solution and background flares .",
    "we also removed the 05 pixel randomization and checked for aspect - solution errors .",
    "we also applied a cti correction to the data for the two acis - i sources .",
    "we corrected for pointing offsets using the appropriate information on the _ chandra _ x - ray center s web - site in order to improve the astrometry .",
    "after screening , we produced an event file of the region centered on the nucleus with a 1  kpc radius .",
    "the coordinates of the stellar nucleus were determined from isophotal contours of infrared images obtained with 2mass .",
    "when coordinates derived from radio measurements or dynamical measurements were available , they were compared with the 2mass coordinates and we found that they were always in agreement within errors ( except for the vlba coordinates of ngc  4552 , which were 1.25 @xmath25 away from the 2mass coordinates ) . for reference",
    "we note that the typical astrometric uncertainty from 2mass isophotal fitting is 125 , while the typical astrometric uncertainties from radio observations are 25  mas ( vla ) , 5  mas ( vlba ) , and 1.3  mas ( vlbi ) . in comparison ,",
    "the astrometric uncertainty of _ chandra _ observations is 05 .",
    "the nucleus of all the galaxies is at most 7away from the acis - s aimpoint , except for ngc  3607 and ngc  3608 , whose nuclei are respectively 211  and 140  from the acis - i aimpoint .",
    "we begin the analysis of the data by constructing images of the central region of each galaxy , which we present in  [ sec : images ] , below .",
    "this is followed by fitting models to the spectra of bright , discrete sources in the nuclei of the host galaxies ( discussed in  [ sec : fits ] ) and to the average spectra of diffuse emission in spiral and elliptical galaxies ( presented in ",
    "[ sec : diffuse ] ) .      from the processed event files , we produced images of a region of radius 1  kpc around the center of each galaxy ( hereafter , the `` central kiloparsec '' ) in two different bands : 0.52  kev and 210  kev .",
    "we also produced hardness ratio maps by combining the soft ( @xmath26 ) and hard ( @xmath27 ) images in the following way : @xmath28 .",
    "for pixels which had no counts in either the soft or the hard band , we adopted a hardness ratio equal to the average of the image .",
    "figure  1 shows the image of the central kiloparsec of each target galaxy in the soft band ( 0.52 kev ) and the hard band ( 210 kev ) and the hardness ratio map .",
    "the morphology of each galaxy is summarized in table  2 .",
    "the first column gives the name of the galaxy , while the second column gives the number of point sources that were identified by the wavdetect algorithm @xcite in the 0.510 kev band .",
    "to prevent wavdetect from confusing fluctuations in diffuse emission with true discrete sources , we ran the algorithm on a @xmath29  kpc region with a threshold of 10@xmath30 .",
    "an s in the third column indicates that a point source is exactly at the center of the galaxy in the 0.52  kev energy band , while an h indicates that a point source in the 210  kev energy band is at the galaxy center .",
    "the combination of an s and an h indicates that the central source is detected in both energy bands . to determine",
    "if a source is coincident with the center of a galaxy , we checked whether the _ chandra _ source coordinates matched the nuclear coordinates ( from 2mass or radio observations ) within the 1-@xmath25 uncertainty region .",
    "the fourth column gives the same information as the third column but for the diffuse emission .",
    "the morphology of the nuclear region as a function of energy can give a first hint for the power source of the liners .",
    "a hard central source suggests an agn and a cluster of point sources or a knotty diffuse emission suggests stellar processes .",
    "when both are observed at the same time , this hints at a combination of a stellar processes and an agn .",
    "we extracted the spectra of all the point sources using the acis extract software ( ae , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "ae uses polygonal extraction regions which approximate contours of the _ chandra _ -acis point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "a psf contour is selected such that the fraction of the psf energy enclosed is approximately 95% .",
    "the background was measured as close to the point sources as possible in order to decrease the contamination from diffuse emission , which is fairly common .",
    "spectral fitting was carried out using xspec  v.11.2.0x @xcite .",
    "the spectra were truncated at 0.5  kev at the low - energy end and between 2 and 10  kev , depending on the s / n , at the high - energy end .",
    "the spectral models were also modified by interstellar photoelectric absorption with cross sections as given by morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "spectra of faint sources with 20200 counts were binned adaptively by ae .",
    "these spectra were then fitted with an absorbed power - law model in order to determine the point source flux .",
    "sources with less than 20 counts could not be fitted because of the small number of degrees of freedom . for these sources",
    "the luminosity was estimated by scaling a power law model ( @xmath31 , close to the median @xmath32 for the individual fits to the point sources ) absorbed by the average galactic column density ( @xmath33 ) so that the predicted count rate equals the observed count rate .",
    "we chose this nominal value of @xmath19 because it is an average galactic column for the sample and a small variation in the @xmath19 ( @xmath34 ) did not have an impact on the resulting x - ray flux . using this model",
    ", we also estimated the lowest detectable 0.510  kev point source luminosity for each galaxy , which we list in table  2 .",
    "the luminosities of all the discrete sources are used in our study of the luminosity functions in  [ sec : populations ] .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties in our _ faint _",
    "( @xmath35 counts ) x - ray point source luminosities by varying @xmath32 by @xmath36 for a power - law absorbed by the galactic column .",
    "the 0.510 kev luminosity then varied by 510% . when varying @xmath32 by @xmath37 , the luminosity changes by 30%40% .",
    "when increasing the absorbing column density by one order of magnitude , the luminosities increased by 525% . increasing the absorbing column density by two orders of magnitude dramatically increased the luminosity by 100%200% .",
    "a small variation in the absorbing column density ( 20% ) did not have an impact on the x - ray luminosity estimate .",
    "thus , based on the above estimates , and assuming that an absorbed power - law model provides an acceptable description of the spectrum , the typical uncertainty in the x - ray luminosities we derive is 30% , unless the absorbing column density is grossly underestimated .",
    "the spectra of sources with more than 200 counts were binned with a minimum of 20 counts per bin and different models were fitted to the spectra in order to determine the nature of the source and the luminosity .",
    "there is never more than one source per galaxy with more than 200 counts and it is usually the central point source .",
    "it is important to find the most apropriate model for the x - ray spectrum so as to determine the absorbing column reliably .",
    "systematic errors in the absorbing column can lead to large systematic errors in the source luminosity .",
    "thus , we have tested the following models :    * a blackbody spectrum ( bb ) , with the temperature ( @xmath38 ) and the normalization as free parameters . * a comptonized blackbody spectrum ( compbb , after nishimura et  al . 1986 ) with the seed blackbody photon temperature ( @xmath39 ) , the electron temperature of the hot plasma ( @xmath40 ) , the optical depth of the plasma ( @xmath41 ) , and the normalization as free parameters .",
    "* a spectrum from an accretion disk consisting of multiple blackbody components ( diskbb , after mitsuda et  al .",
    "1984 ; makishima et al . 1986 ) with the temperature at the inner disk radius ( @xmath42 ) and the normalization as free parameters . * an emission spectrum from hot diffuse gas with up to three components at different temperatures ( mekal , mekal2 t , mekal3 t ; after mewe et  al . 1985 , 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ; liedhal et  al . 1995 ) with the plasma temperature ( @xmath43 ) , the metallicity ( @xmath44 , initially set to solar ) , and the normalization as free parameters .",
    "the redshift was set to 0 since the galaxies are all nearby . *",
    "a power - law spectrum ( pow ) with the photon index of the power - law ( @xmath32 ) , and the normalization as free parameters . * a spectrum from an accretion disk around a black hole in an x - ray binary compton scattered from in a converging , plasma flow ( bmc , after titarchuk et  al .",

    "1999 ; schrader & titarchuk 1999 ) with the temperature of the thermal photon source ( @xmath45 ) , the index of the electron power - law energy distribution ( @xmath16 ) , the illumination parameter , and the normalization as free parameters .",
    "we have also tested certain linear combinations of these models such as blackbody plus power law or mekal plus power law ( as well as multiple mekal components at different temperatures ) .",
    "these models can describe the spectra of x - ray binaries , accreting supermassive black holes or thermal diffuse emission depending on their luminosity and fit parameters .",
    "for low mass x - ray binaries , the shape of the spectrum depends on the spectral state @xcite . in the high soft state",
    ", the spectrum can be modeled as a soft component ( bb with @xmath46  kev or diskbb with @xmath42 between 0.5 and 1.5 kev ) and a comptonized component ( compbb ) with @xmath47 , @xmath48  kev and @xmath45 between 0.3 and 1.5 kev and with @xmath49 between @xmath3 and @xmath50 . in the low hard hard state",
    ", the spectra low - mass x - ray binaries can be modeled as a soft component and a power - law tail but with with lower relative luminosities ( and absolute luminosities below the detection limit in our sample galaxies ) .",
    "high - mass x - ray binaries have a hard spectrum with @xmath51 that can be modeled as a power - law of @xmath52 @xcite . accreting supermassive black hole such as those found at the center of seyfert galaxies",
    "are observed to have a power - law spectrum with @xmath53 .",
    "their luminosities are typically greater than @xmath54 erg s@xmath2 ( see mushotzky , done , & pounds , 1993 , and references therein ) , but less luminous agns are well known to exist , especially in liners .",
    "table  3 summarizes the two best - fitting models for the spectrum of the central object in each galaxy , or the brightest off - nuclear object . fits with an acceptable value of the reduced @xmath55 but with unphysical parameters ( @xmath19 lower than that listed in table  1 , unreasonable photon index or temperature )",

    "column  2 of table 3 gives the models that provided the best two fits and the values of the model parameters .",
    "column  3 gives the @xmath55 and the number of degrees of freedom , and column  4 the luminosity calculated for the model in the 0.510  kev range .",
    "for all these models , we assumed a solar metal abundance . in figure",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , we show the best - fitting model for each spectrum ( the first one listed for each object in table 3 ) superposed on the data along with the post - fit residuals .",
    "when there were significant residuals , we tried to modify the metallicity using the values given by terlevich & forbes ( 2002 ) and letting it vary , but it never suppressed the residuals , nor did it improve the reduced @xmath55 , and was not supported by a f - test ; therefore we kept solar abundances .",
    "we explored the effects of assuming solar abundance in objects with sub - solar or super - solar abundances by increasing and lowering the abundace and measuring the change in the other fit parameters .",
    "we found that the other fit parameters ( column density , power - law index , temperature , luminosity ) varied very slightly ( @xmath56 ) when the abundance increased or decreased by one order of magnitude .      in 70% of the galaxies of our sample we find diffuse emission in the central kiloparsec .",
    "the frequent presence of diffuse emission was already noted by halderson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in 87% of the galaxies that have diffuse emission",
    ", this emission contributes over 50% of the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the flux from the diffuse emission in each galaxy was not high enough to yield a high s / n spectrum individually except for ngc  3628 .",
    "thus , we stacked the spectra from all the galaxies .",
    "first , we extracted the spectrum from a 1 kpc radius around the center of each galaxy by carefully subtracting all the point sources and by choosing a background region free of diffuse emission and point sources . in the process of subtracting the point sources we also subtracted some diffuse emission , which makes our estimate of the diffuse emission luminosity a lower limit , strictly speaking .",
    "since the number of point sources in each galaxy is small ( 3 on average ) , we estimate that this lower limit is not too far from the true luminosity . before combining the spectra",
    ", we normalized them to a fiducial total count rate of 0.1 s@xmath2 so that the result is a good representation of the average spectrum of this type of source .",
    "then we stacked the spectra using the ftool addspec and propagated the errors appropriately .",
    "ngc  3607 and ngc  3608 were not included in the stacking procedure because they were observed with a different ccd and addspec requires that all the observations are made with the same ccd .",
    "we stacked separately the diffuse emission from spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting spectra .",
    "the diffuse emission spectra were not well fitted by a two - temperature component plasma , instead they required a plasma model plus a power - law , with parameters as given in table  3 .",
    "the spectra themselves , with models superposed are shown in figure  [ fig : stackedspec ] .",
    "the model parameters are very similar between elliptical and spiral galaxies , @xmath57 , @xmath58  kev , @xmath591.31.5 , with solar abundance .",
    "we also let the abundance vary as a free parameter , but the improvement in reduced @xmath60 was not significant according to the f - test . in  [ sec : populations ] we estimate the average luminosity of unresolved x - ray binaries in the inner kiloparsec and we show that it is comparable to the luminosity of the power - law spectral component .",
    "we also fitted the diffuse emission spectrum of ngc  3628 independently and we fount that the two best models were either a two - temperature plasma model or a power law with parameters as given in table  3 ( the spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the spectral parameters for this particular galaxy are in general agreement with what we find for the stacked spectra , above .",
    "we also note that david et al .",
    "( 2005 ) studied the diffuse emission spectrum of one of the galaxies in our sample , ngc  3379 , and found that it could be fitted with a similar model as our stacked spectra , above .",
    "the plasma component of the diffuse emission has a similar temperature in both types of galaxies with a value that is slightly lower than what is observed in normal galaxies ; @xmath610.7 kev for spirals @xcite and @xmath62  kev for ellipticals @xcite . from the normalization constant of the xspec fit ( after rescaling it to the average _ observed _ count rate )",
    ", we can calculate the emission measure and then the density .",

    "* ) . from the stacked spectra",
    ", we can also deduce that the average x - ray luminosity of the diffuse emission ( integrated over the inner kiloparsec ) is @xmath65 for the ellipticals and @xmath66 for the spirals . within uncertainties , the luminosities of the diffuse emission in spiral and elliptical galaxies are comparable to each other . we calculated the luminosity of the diffuse emission for each galaxy individually by scaling the model luminosity to the count rate for each galaxy .",
    "table  4 summarizes the 0.52 and 210 kev luminosity of the diffuse emission within the central kiloparsec of each galaxy ( columns 2 and 3 ) and the 0.52 and 210 kev luminosity of the diffuse emission in the central 25 region ( columns 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the last quantity was computed by integrating the model spectrum after scaling it to the count rate of each individual ; we use this quantity in our evaluation of the power sources of individual galaxies in  [ sec : individual ] .    the sound speed of the hot gas is @xmath67 km s@xmath2 ( assuming solar composition , full ionization and @xmath68 kev ; @xmath69 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath70 is the mean molecular weight ) , slightly larger than the stellar velocity dispersions in these galaxies .",
    "the dynamical and cooling time scales of the hot gas are @xmath71  years and @xmath72  years , respectively ( assuming that the gas is contained in a sphere of @xmath73  pc ) . in view of these time scales and the fact that the sound speed is not considerably higher than the stellar velocity dispersion , it appears likely that the gas is bound to the host galaxy and its temperature is sustained by interaction with the stars .",
    "the gas may , in fact , originate in stellar mass loss . as david et al .",
    "( 2005 ) note , the mass of hot gas in ngc  3379 is approximately @xmath74 and it could have been supplied by stellar mass loss over a period of only @xmath21  years .",
    "the liners in our sample have between zero and 12 point sources in their central kiloparsec ( including candidate agns ) with an average number of approximately 3 point sources and a most frequent value of two point sources .",

    "( 2005 , 2006 )",
    ". in 12 out of 19 liners there are signs of an agn whether it dominated the x - ray luminosity or not . in 5/19 liners",
    "we did not detect an agn , with upper limits to the luminosity as listed in table  4 . for 2/19 liners ( ngc  4636 and ngc  7331 )",

    ", we notice that for 10 of the 12 galaxies with an agn candidate , the agn dominates the 210  kev luminosity in the inner 25 ; in 9 out of these 10 cases , the agn dominates the total 210  kev luminosity in the inner kiloparsec .",
    "when we consider the luminosity in the entire 0.510  kev band , however , the contribution of the diffuse emission is often comparable to the contribution of the agn , even in the inner 25 .",

    "we note that the detected agns span a wide range in 210 kev luminosity , from @xmath200 to @xmath201 , with an average of @xmath202 .",
    "this luminosity range is comparable to that found by terashima & wilson ( 2003 ) for llagn in liners with bright , compact radio sources .",
    "we can express the eddington ratio of the agns we have detected ( the ratio of the bolometric luminosity of the agn and the eddington luminosity ) as follows : @xmath203 @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the black hole mass reported in table  1 , @xmath206 is the x - ray luminosity ( reported in table  4 ) and @xmath207 is a `` bolometric correction '' ( see ho 1999 ) .",

    "we note that they used a bolometric correction three times higher than the one we use , but this does not account for the whole difference .",
    "their agns have higher x - ray luminosities so the very low eddington ratios agns in our sample are probably the very low luminosity agns missing from their sample .    [ [ comparison - with - normal - galaxies - and - the - source - of - fuel - for - the - agn ] ] comparison with normal galaxies and the source of fuel for the agn ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the x - ray luminosities and eddington ratios of the accreting black holes in our sample of liners are very similar to those of black holes in the `` quiescent '' galaxies studied by soria et al .",
    "( 2006a , b ) .",
    "moreover , the properties of the diffuse emission ( gas temperature , density , and soft x - ray luminosity ; see  [ sec : diffuse ] ) as well as the black hole masses in the two samples are quite similar .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the bondi accretion rates should also be similar .",
    "indeed , an inspection of figure  5 of soria et al .",
    "( 2006b ) shows that several of the liners in our sample fall in the same region of the eddington ratio @xmath212 bondi rate diagram . as soria et al .",
    "( 2006b ) demonstrate , the fuel necessary to power the observed low - level activity in their sample can easily be provided by a combination of mass loss from stars within the black hole s `` sphere of influence '' and from the flow of hot interstellar gas into that sphere from larger radii ( bondi accretion ) .",
    "in fact , the hot interstellar gas itself is likely to have originated in stellar mass loss over a larger volume around the center of the galaxy ( see our earlier discussion in  [ sec : diffuse ] ) .",
    "the same interpretation applies to the liners that we study here , based on the close similarities between the nuclear properties of the two samples .",
    "these similarities also contribute to the puzzle of why some galaxies host liners while others do not . to address this question",
    "we examine the energy budget of the agn in the next section in the broader context of the power - source behind the optical emission - line spectra of liners .      in this sample , stellar processes , as manifested by soft , diffuse emission , seem to frequently contribute to the energy budget of the central 25 region , whether alone or in combination with an agn .",
    "the agn is often not the major power source . to illustrate this we plot in figure  [ fig : balance ] the luminosity from the diffuse emission @xmath212 the luminosity from the agn in the 0.510  kev and 210  kev bands . in more than half of the cases",
    "the diffuse emission dominates .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether the dominant contribution to the x - ray luminosity depends on the liner classification or the hubble type , but our sample is too small to allow any firm conclusions on these questions .    to investigate the role of the agn in powering the observed optical emission lines , we looked for correlations between the different x - ray luminosities and the h@xmath16 luminosity ( taken from ho et al 1997a ) .",
    "we find a correlation between @xmath213 and @xmath214 of the central 25 region ( spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath215 ) .",
    "our objects fall in the same region of the @xmath216@xmath213 diagram as the lowest - luminosity objects of ho et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and also very close to the correlation between these two quantities followed by low - redshift quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies . this can be seen in figure  [ fig : hoandmine ] where the squares represent the data from our sample and the stars represent the liners observed by ho et  al .",

    "( 2001 ) that do not follow the correlation are mostly transition - type liners , which were not included in the calculation of the correlation . ] .",
    "we also draw the best fit found by ho et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) as the solid line and the range of luminosity where a starburst would fall ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the latter locus is obtained by combining relations between these two quantities and the star formation rate ( kennicutt 1998 ; ranalli , comastri , & cetti 2003 ; grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003 ; colbert et  al .",
    "2004 ; persic et  al .",
    "it is noteworthy that none of our objects are close to the starburst locus , which is consistent with an absence of young stellar populations in the majority of the galaxies in our sample .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lxvslha ] , we focus on the correlation between the 25 x - ray and h@xmath16 luminosities for the objects in our sample .",
    "the trend persists regardless of whether we use the 210  kev or the 0.52  kev luminosity .",
    "in fact , the correlation appears stronger when considering the soft x - ray band instead of the hard x - ray band : the spearman rank correlation coefficients are 0.48 and 0.33 in the soft and hard bands respectively .",
    "this suggests that production mechanism of the h@xmath16 line is not strongly correlated to the source of the hard x - ray radiation .",
    "figure  [ fig : lxvslha ] gives a preliminary indication that photoionization by the agn is unlikely to be responsible for powering the optical emission lines .",
    "we have carried out the following tests to investigate this issue further .    1 .",
    "the first test is based on energy balance between the emission lines and the ionizing continuum .",
    "assuming that the ionizing continuum is a power - law of photon index @xmath32 from 1  ry to 100  kev ( consistent with adaf models ) , its total luminosity can be obtained from the observed 210  kev luminosity via @xmath219 , where the function @xmath220 has values between 5 and 12 for @xmath32 in the range 1.11.9 .",
    "thus for the ionizing continuum to power the h@xmath16 luminosity alone , we require that @xmath221 . out of the 19 objects in our sample ,",
    "only four satisfy this condition , under the most optimistic assumption . in the case of ngc  1553 ,",
    "ngc  4374 ngc  4494 , and ngc  4552 the ionizing continuum luminosity exceeds the h@xmath16 luminosity by a factor of a few in the best case .",
    "additional power would be available , if the agn sed included a significant `` uv bump '' , but this appears rather unlikely , in view of the llagn sed shapes shown by ho ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is also unlikely that we have underestimated the x - ray luminosity of the agn because of absorption .",
    "this is because the spectra of 2/3 of our agn have a sufficiently high s / n that we were able to fit them , determine the absorbing column , and correct the luminosity ( of course , we can not rule out the possibility that the entire x - ray emission is scattered and that we do not have a direct view of the agn ) .",
    "another test for the photoionization hypothesis relies on photon counting .",
    "assuming the same continuum shape as above , we can express the ionizing photon rate produced by the agn in terms of the observed x - ray luminosity as @xmath222 .",
    "the function @xmath223 has values between 2 and 30 for @xmath32 in the range 1.11.9 . by relating this to the h@xmath16 photon rate",
    ", we can derive the following requirement for the h@xmath16 luminosity : @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the fraction of ionizing photons absorbed by the emission - line gas and one in 2.2 recombinations leads to the emission of an h@xmath16 photon ( osterbrock 1989 ; we have assumed that there are no secondary ionizations or excitations by fast photoelectrons ) .",
    "none of the objects in our sample satisfy this condition , even if @xmath226 .",
    "the four objects identified in the previous paragraph could satisfy this condition if each ionizing photon leads to 25 ionizations , on average .",
    "all other objects would require more than 10 secondary ionizations ; most require more than 100 .",
    "thus the agns in the objects of our present sample are not energetically significant .",
    "it is also noteworthy that in more than half the cases , the electromagnetic power of the agn is not enough to drive the diffuse x - ray emission . examining the samples of terashima & wilson ( 2003 ) and filho et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we notice a similar effect .",
    "in particular , the former sample includes agns typically an order of magnitude more luminous than ours but the faintest 25% of their agns fail the energy budget test and can not power the h@xmath16 emission . in the latter sample the x - ray detected agns have comparable luminosities to ours and they all fail the energy budget test .",
    "it appears , at least at first glance , that as the luminosity of the agn decreases , its important as the power source of the optical emission lines diminishes too .",
    "therefore , we conclude our discussion by considering other possible sources of power for the optical emission lines below .      the analysis presented above",
    "shows that the properties of the liners in the present sample are very similar to those of normal galaxies .",
    "more specifically , the hot interstellar gas in these liners has , on average , the same temperature , density , and luminosity as in normal galaxies .",
    "moreover , the average properties of the stellar populations in these liners are similar to those of normal galaxies : the x - ray binary luminosity functions are the same and in most of our liners the optical spectra indicate old stellar populations . finally ,",
    "even though an agn is often detected , its electromagnetic power does not appear to be significant .",
    "thus we must look for an explanation for the liner optical spectra that involves either stellar processes or a mechanical interaction of the agn with its immediate environs .    in three of the liners in our sample ( ngc  3507 , ngc  3628 , and ngc  5055 )",
    "there is evidence for a young stellar population , while in one other object ( ngc  2681 ) there is evidence for an intermediate - age population . in more general terms , cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that 38% of liners and transition objects have intermediate - age stellar populations in their very nuclei .",
    "hot stars from a young stellar population are obvious sources of ionizing photons that could power the optical emission lines ( see  1 ) . in old and especially in intermediate - age",
    "stellar populations , ionizing photons can be provided by post - agb stars and the central stars of planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the agn powers the emission lines by depositing mechanical energy via outflows ( jets or winds ) into the emission line gas . at the low eddington ratios that we find here",
    ", the kinetic power of jets from the agn can be significantly higher ( by up to 3 orders of magnitude ) than the electromagnetic luminosity ( see nagar , falcke , & wilson 2005 ) .",
    "some of this power may be dissipated by shocks in the immediate vicinity of the agn , which would naturally lead to liner - like emission line spectra .",
    "this hypothesis is bolstered by the observation that the emission - line regions of liners are rather amorphous or filamentary on scales of 10100  pc @xcite .",
    "this type of feedback from the agn may also contribute to additional heating of the diffuse gas , which in turn would limit the accretion rate and lead to the very low eddington ratio that we infer ( see the discussion by soria et al .",
    "2006b ) .    in conclusion , we note that even though some liners are obviously powered by their agns ( m81 and ngc  4579 are among the best known examples ) , the electromagnetic luminosity of the agn is not always enough to account for the observed emission - line luminosity .",
    "all of the physical processes discussed in the literature so far may contribute to powering the emission line spectra , making liners a heterogeneous class of objects and suggesting that agn photoionization may be the exception rather than the rule .",

    "<S> using archival _ chandra _ observations of 19 liners we explore the x - ray properties of their inner kiloparsec to determine the origin of their nuclear x - ray emission , to investigate the presence of an agn , and to identify the power source of the optical emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the relative numbers of liner types in our sample are similar to those in optical spectroscopic surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we find that diffuse , thermal emission is very common and is concentrated within the central few hundred parsec . </S>",

    "<S> the agns contribute a median of 60% of the 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity of the central 25 region , they have luminosities of @xmath3@xmath4 ( eddington ratios of @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ionizing luminosity of the agns is not enough to power the observed optical emission lines in this particular sample . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we suggest that the lines are powered either by the mechanical interaction of an agn jet ( or wind ) with the circumnuclear gas , or by stellar processes , such as photoionization by post - agb stars from an old or intermediate - age population ( in most cases ) or by young stars ( in a few cases ) .    </S>",
