    "with long baseline neutrino experiments it is possible to measure the neutrino velocity by the time difference between neutrino detection and production .",
    "recently the opera neutrino experiment on the 730 km cern - gran sasso neutrino beam has measured a difference of @xmath0 ns with respect to the time computed assuming that muon neutrinos are traveling with the speed of light observed by opera .",
    "there is no apparent energy dependence of this time difference between @xmath1 gev , the energy spread of the cngs beam .",
    "this result , if confirmed , would imply that neutrino are tachyons with speed above @xmath2 the speed of light by @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with the result of the minos experiment that applied a similar technique but with a much larger error @xcite .",
    "the opera result is however in disagreement with the observation of anti - electron neutrinos of energies of about 10 mev from the famous supernova sn1987a providing an upper limit of of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if the effect is real , then this could hint to a possible energy dependent effect or other yet unknown flavor dependent effect .",
    "the interaction of a primary cosmic ray with the atmosphere produces a cascade with many kind of particles , and in particular neutrinos and muons .",
    "muon neutrinos and muons are produced mainly via the decay of charged pions and kaons produced in the primary cosmic ray interactions and above about 10 tev they can come also from prompt decays of charmed hadrons .",
    "this last component has not yet been observed .",
    "the neutrinos in this cascade , if the opera result is correct , should arrive before the muons from the same parent decay with a time delay that should change according to the neutrino path length that depends on its zenith angle @xmath5 . in underground detectors",
    "muon neutrinos are detected looking for induced muons produced by neutrino charged current interactions in the rock , and the ice around or inside the instrumented region .",
    "hence , a time spread should be observed between the muons produced by the pion or kaon decay directly and the muon produced by neutrino interactions .",
    "the path length from the meson decay point is a few tens of kilometers for vertical neutrinos and up to @xmath6  km for near horizontal neutrinos . assuming that the time difference observed in opera is not energy dependent and it is 60 ns",
    ", nearly horizontal neutrinos should arrive up to 28 nsec before the other secondaries . in ref .",
    "@xcite a table of average production heights neutrinos in the atmosphere has been reported .",
    "the typical production height for neutrinos of energy above 20 gev can be 17.6 km at the vertical , 94.9 km at @xmath7 and 335.7 km at @xmath8 , which would correspond to 1.4 , 78 and 27.6  ns .",
    "the typical time resolutions of photomultipliers ( pmts ) , including the associated electronics , is between @xmath9  ns @xcite .",
    "typical tracks are reconstructed using a number of pmt time hits @xmath10 and the time uncertainty associated to a muon track depends such number as @xmath11 .",
    "there are already limits to tachions in cosmic rays .",
    "the limits are obtained looking for example to signals before the main front of the electromagetic shower . but this kind of searches stopped some time ago and the last particle data book review related to this tachion searches is the one of 1994 @xcite .",
    "the limits obtained are of small interest in the framework of the opera result . however ,",
    "if neutrinos are tachions , it is likely that other kind of tachions could exist and this search in very high energy cosmic rays could have a new interest .",
    "the macro experiment has done several searches for possible anomalies of the time differences between muons @xcite .",
    "the searches were dedicated mainly to study time differences of the order of a few msec or more , but ref .",
    "@xcite contains also the study of time differences at the ns - level .",
    "the results of this study was that the largest time differences between two muons was 18 ns and that the time distribution was in agreement with the predictions .",
    "the statistics was limited to 35832 tracks in events with two or more tracks . in 1992",
    "none was thinking to tachionic neutrinos and therefore there was no estimate of the number of tracks due to down - going neutrino together with a primary muons . in ref  @xcite",
    "this study was extended to about 140000 tracks of multi muon events , corresponding to about @xmath12 of the total macro statistics .",
    "the time distribution was in agreement with the predictions .",
    "currently the largest neutrino detector in operation is the icecube detector at the south pole .",
    "we will discuss in the following paragraphs the possibility to measures the time delay between the muon produced by the neutrino interaction in the ice and the muon produced directly in the atmosphere using icecube and the compact detector inside icecube called deepcore .",
    "deepcore , vetoed by the surrounding icecube strings , has the possibility to separate events produced internally by neutrinos and the muons directly produced in the decays in the atmosphere .",
    "the real analysis is made difficult by the scarce density of photodetectors that prevents a reliable tracking of multiple muons in one event but the veto possibility offered by the pmts surrounding deepcore and the large dimensions of icecube may make this measurement interesting .",
    "in fact the tracking can be applied to clusters of hits recognized by ` hit cleaning ' algorithms that can be applied to recognize different topologies in the same time frame of the data acquisition .",
    "antares has better time resolution for muon tracks than icecube due to the smaller amount of light scattering .",
    "a similar analysis may be attempted there though the identification of the neutrino may be more tricky in the absence of a veto .",
    "super - kamiokande can measure internal neutrino events and has good pattern recognition capabilities as well as opera and minos that have also excellent time of flight measurement capabilities .",
    "even if these detectors have limited dimension and may not be able to identify internal downgoing neutrinos , they have good tracking capabilities and may perform a measurement of muon bundle timing .",
    "all muons should arrive at the same time compatibly with the time resolution , but muons induced by neutrinos could arrive earlier if they are tachions .",
    "we have calculated the atmospheric muon neutrino flux using the tables provided by the japanese group in @xcite .",
    "their calculation is described in @xcite .",
    "we have fit these tables for muon neutrinos and anti - neutrinos with a 5 degree - polynomial function of @xmath13 , where e and @xmath5 are the energy and nadir angle of the neutrino respectively : @xmath14    the parameters of the fit are given in tab .",

    "we have made an approximate calculation of the number of muon events accompanying neutrino events in a detector like icecube .",
    "the determination of the arrival time of the muons and the difference of the arrival of the accompanying neutrinos could be used to verify in the atmospheric neutrino sector the opera observation .",
    "also the time differences between muons in a bundle may indicate that a part of them may have arrived a little earlier",
    ". this would be the case for the muons induced by neutrinos .",
