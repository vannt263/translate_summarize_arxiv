    "in recent years , the casimir interactions between two compact objects have been under active investigation .",
    "different methods have been developed to compute the casimir interactions beyond the accuracies afforded by the proximity force approximations . using functional determinant or multiple scattering approach @xcite , the casimir interaction between two objects can be written in terms of the scattering matrices of each object and the translation matrices which relate the different bases for computing the scattering of each object . in principal ,",
    "the functional representation of the casimir interaction allows one to numerically compute the exact magnitude of the casimir interaction at any separation .",
    "however , the matrices involved are often infinite matrices and truncations are required , which at smaller separation , pose a big challenge since the size of the matrices required for accurate computation is inversely proportional to the distance between the objects . on the analytical side ,",
    "the situation is the same .",
    "it is easy to obtain the large separation asymptotic expansion of the casimir interaction from a finite number of terms in the matrices .",
    "however , to obtain the small separation asymptotic expansions , all the terms have to be taken into account .    in the pioneering work @xcite , a perturbation method have been developed to compute the small separation leading order and next - to - leading order terms of the zero temperature casimir interaction between a cylinder and a plane .",
    "this method was later extended to the sphere - plane @xcite and cylinder - cylinder @xcite configurations , as well as the finite temperature case @xcite .",
    "very recently , a new method called derivative expansion has been developed for computing the small separation next - to - leading order term of the casimir interaction @xcite . while the method of @xcite derives the asymptotic expansion from the exact functional determinant representation of the casimir interaction , the methods of @xcite are completely different . in @xcite , the authors considered the scalar interaction between an object imposed with dirichlet boundary conditions and a dirichlet plane .",
    "they computed the asymptotic expansion by performing a derivative expansion on the field in the path integral representation of the casimir free energy .",
    "the leading order term coincides with the proximity force approximation and a general expression for the next - to - leading order term was derived . on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "the next - to - leading order term is computed based on a postulate that the casimir free energy have a local expansion of a certain form involving the gradient of the height profiles of the objects .    in this article",
    ", we consider the casimir interaction between two spheres , for both scalar fields and electromagnetic fields .",
    "this is one of the most popular configuration under consideration @xcite .",
    "the functional determinant representations of the casimir interactions have been obtained in various works @xcite , which were used to compute the large separation asymptotic expansions analytically . for small separations which are more experimentally relevant , it has been claimed that the first two leading terms can be computed using the derivative expansion method developed in @xcite . since this method",
    "is based on a postulate that has not yet been proven , we find that it is necessary to compute the asymptotic expansions from the exact representation of the casimir interaction .",
    "this task is undertaken in this paper .",
    "we will consider both the cases where one sphere is inside the other , and the two spheres are outside each other .    throughout this paper , we use units with @xmath0 .",

    "in this section , we use proximity force approximation to find the leading asymptotic behaviors of the casimir free energy and the casimir force between two spheres when the separation between them is small . as in @xcite",

    "= 0.5    first we consider the case where sphere @xmath1 is inside sphere @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . the sphere @xmath2 can be parametrized by @xmath68 : @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "it follows that the proximity force approximation for the casimir force is @xmath103for the low temperature and medium temperature regions where @xmath104 , we can use the inverse mellin transform formula @xmath105 to transform into @xmath106now the asymptotic behavior of @xmath107 when @xmath104 can be read off from the residues of the right hand side . using @xmath108we",

    "differentiating with respect to @xmath7 gives the proximity force approximation to the casimir force : @xmath116 and give the leadings terms in the medium temperature region .",
    "the first terms on the right hand sides are the zero temperature leading terms , and the second terms are the leading terms for the temperature corrections .",
    "notice that these leading terms of the temperature corrections are finite when @xmath117 . in the low temperature region",
    "where @xmath118 , only the zero temperature leading terms are dominating .    in the case of rd or dr boundary conditions , the proximity force approximation of the casimir free energy gives the leading behavior : @xmath119computing in exactly the same way as in the case of dd or rr boundary conditions , we find that @xmath120 @xmath121where the functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 are given respectively by @xmath124 in the high temperature region where @xmath100 , the leading terms for the casimir free energy and the casimir force are respectively @xmath125 @xmath126when @xmath104 , @xmath127 @xmath128 as before , and give the leading terms in the medium temperature region .",
    "the first terms on the right hand sides give the zero temperature leading terms , and the second terms are the leading terms of the temperature corrections .",
    "notice that for the casimir force , the leading term of the temperature correction is linear in @xmath7 .",
    "the constant term is missing . in the low temperature region ,",
    "the leading terms are the zero temperature leading terms .",
    "= 0.5    for the case where the two spheres are outside each other ( see fig . [ f2 ] ) , we only integrate over the part of the sphere @xmath2 with @xmath129 this gives @xmath130 where @xmath73 is still given by but @xmath131 . making a change of variable as before ,",
    "we have @xmath132the rest of the computations are the same as for the case where one sphere is inside the other . the results are almost identical to the results above , except that one has to change the factor @xmath133 in the denominators to @xmath134 .",
    "in fact one finds that one would obtain the same results even if the integration is carried out over the whole sphere @xmath2 .",
    "finally , for electromagnetic field , it was well known that the casimir free energy density for a pair of parallel plates , where both are perfectly conducting or both are infinitely permeable , is twice of the casimir free energy density for a pair of parallel dircichlet plates . the casimir free energy density for a pair of parallel plates , where one is perfectly conducting and one is infinitely permeable , is twice of the casimir free energy density for a pair of parallel plates , where one is dirichlet and one is neumann .",
    "therefore , for two spheres which are both perfectly conducting or both infinitely permeable , the proximity force approximations for the casimir free energy and casimir force are twice of that for two spheres which are both imposed with dirichlet boundary conditions . for two spheres where one is perfectly conducting and one is infinitely permeable , the proximity force approximations for the casimir free energy and casimir force are twice of that for two spheres where",
    "one is imposed with dirichlet boundary conditions and one is imposed with robin boundary conditions .",

    "in this section , we are going to compute the small distance asymptotic behavior of the zero temperature casimir energy from the exact formulas given in section [ s2 ] .",
    "the method we are using is similar to that used in @xcite to find the asymptotic behavior between a cylinder and a plate and in @xcite to find the asymptotic behavior between a sphere and a plate . in @xcite , we have extended this method to the case of two cylinders . for two spheres ,",
    "things are more involved because the @xmath136 matrix is more complicated .",
    "we will explain our method in detail for the case where sphere @xmath1 is inside sphere @xmath2 . at the end of this section",
