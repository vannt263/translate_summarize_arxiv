    "in an earlier paper @xcite , which we will refer to as i in this work , we have considered some of the consequences of applying the second law of thermodynamics to an isolated system @xmath2 , which consists of a macroscopic system of interest @xmath0 containing a fixed number @xmath3 of particles ( atoms or molecules ) surrounded by an extremely large medium @xmath1 ; see  fig .",
    "[ fig_systems ] .",
    "from now on , it will be implicitly assumed that the medium is extremely large to be unaffected by the system .",
    "( later in this work , we will also consider @xmath0 to have a fixed volume @xmath4 instead of @xmath3 or fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we will also consider briefly the case of many similar size systems forming the isolated system @xmath2 without the extremely large medium @xmath1 . )",
    "the motivation has been to develop this approach to obtain a non - equilibrium thermodynamic description of the open system @xmath0 under various conditions . throughout this work , we will use _ body _ to refer to any of the three kinds systems : the isolated system , the medium or the system .",
    "all quantities related to @xmath5 and @xmath0 will be denoted by a suffix @xmath6,@xmath7 over the top , and without any suffix , respectively .",
    "all quantities related to a body will be denoted without any suffix , as if we are dealing with an open system .",
    "similarly , in this work , we will say that the system is _ open _ when it is in a medium .",
    "even though it is not the common usage , this should not cause any confusion as the context will be clear .",
    "[ ptb ]    system_modified_1.eps    to avoid complications due to external shear , we had only considered @xmath0 under no external shear in i. this restriction is easily removed as we will do here .",
    "the isolated system will still have _ no _ external force acting on it to ensure its isolation ; see below also .",
    "we will now allow forces acting at the surface @xmath8 of the system or any of its subsystems ; see fig . [ fig_two_boxes_modified_system](a ) .",
    "these forces must balance the internal stress tensor for mechanical equilibrium .",
    "thus , the force @xmath9 acting on a surface element @xmath10 must equal the stress force @xmath11 ( summation over repeated indices implied ) , and we have @xcite for the surface traction force@xmath12    [ ptb ]    two_boxes_modified_system.eps    here , @xmath13 is the outward unit normal at the surface element @xmath10 surrounding a point on the surface",
    ". this condition must be satisfied at every point on the surface @xmath14 the net force and torque acting on the system are given by @xmath15 respectively ; here , for convenience , @xmath16 is taken to be the radius vector of the surface element with respect to the center of mass of the system .",
    "the external forces are responsible for the deformation of the system , and also result in the translation and rotation of the system .",
    "let us consider an infinitesimal volume element @xmath17 of mass @xmath18 , which is moving with a velocity @xmath19 and rotating with an angular velocity @xmath20 and has an intrinsic angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "the linear and angular momenta of the system in some fixed frame are given by@xmath22 respectively ; here @xmath23  is the mass of the system ( @xmath24 being the mass of a particle ) , which we consider fixed for fixed @xmath3 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the location and the translational velocity of the center of mass in this frame .",
    "if the frame is taken to be the center of mass frame , then @xmath25 and @xmath26 are zero . if the body as a whole is _",
    ", then the energy of the body is known as the internal energy .",
    "such a stationary situation was considered in our previous work @xcite , where no motions were considered .",
    "this limitation will be removed here so as to allow for relative motions ( translation and rotation ) between the system and the medium .",
    "these relative motions are the additional sources of viscous dissipation and give rise to additional irreversibility .",
    "the irreversibility due to temperature difference ( such as between the system and the medium ) has already been considered in i.    we should mention here the recent somewhat comprehensive investigation carried out by bouchbinder and langer @xcite who also consider a system under external shear ; however , our approaches and emphases are very different .",
    "we should also mention earlier very different equilibrium - like attempts by lubchenko and wolynes @xcite and by ttinger @xcite .",
    "mention should also be made of a very interesting phenomenological approach by oono and paniconi @xcite on steady state thermodynamics , which was later advanced by sasa and tasaki @xcite .",
    "the classical local non - equilibrium thermodynamics due to de donder @xcite is close in spirit to our approach and that of bouchbinder and langer @xcite",
    ". it will be the standard formulation with which we will compare and contrast our approach initiated in @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the sake of continuity and clarity , we briefly discuss the classical formulation involving local equilibrium in sect .",
    "[ marker_local_thermodynamics ] .",
    "we note that there are other versions of non - equilibrium thermodynamics usually known as the extended , rational and generic non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite ; however , we do not discuss these formulations in this work .",
    "it is well known that the second law of thermodynamics for the isolated system @xmath2 states that@xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the entropy of @xmath2 at some instant @xmath29 .",
    "it should be stressed that the isolation of @xmath2 requires that there be something outside of  @xmath2 from which it is isolated .",
    "therefore , we will assumes that @xmath2  is confined to a finite though extremely large volume @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the isolation requires that we neglect all interactions , such as gravitational interactions , of @xmath2 with the outside that can not be shielded .",
    "all interactions with the outside should be relatively very weak to be _",
    "negligible_. all relevant interactions must be confined inside the volume @xmath30 .",
    "this to not to be taken as a weakness of our approach as including the interactions with outside will only make @xmath2 an open system , so that our investigation of an open system , which is our primary concern , can then be applied to it .",
    "we should emphasize the following important point .",
    "the law of increase of entropy in eq .",
    "( [ second_law_0 ] ) should give a pause to those readers who believe that the concept of entropy is meaningful only for an equilibrium state and that the entropy can not be defined for a non - equilibrium state .",
    "this belief is unfounded .",
    "the mere fact that the second law dictates the approach to equilibrium clearly implies that the entropy exists even when the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "this issue and the related history , in particular the gibbs formulation of the non - equilibrium entropy , has been reviewed recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references cited therein ) , and we refer the reader to this for further details . we should stress that the gibbs formulation of the entropy requires that the dynamics of the system and that of the isolated system are not deterministic , but rather stochastic ; see @xcite for further details .",
    "an assumption that was implicit , but not stated , in i was that there was no relative motion between the system and the medium and that the isolated system was stationary .",
    "this is normally the case in practice in which the various bodies @xmath31 and @xmath32 are stationary in the laboratory frame of reference ; the latter we will denote by @xmath33 in this work . in general , one can allow for a translation and rotation of a body , as done here because we now wish to study their effects on the deformation of the system .",
    "because of the stationary assumption , there is no difference between the energy and the internal energy for @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "this is a very common but useful assumption as the entropies depend on the internal energies and not on the energies @xcite .",
    "the latter energies may contain the contribution from the translation and rotation of the system as a whole .",
    "in contrast , the internal energies are the energies systems have in a frame in which they are stationary .",
    "whenever we discuss both energies together in the following , the internal energy will be denoted by a superscript `` i '' to distinguish it from the energy , which is denoted without the superscript ; otherwise , it will be clear which energy we are considering . for a stationary system in the lab frame @xmath33 ,  the internal energy is the same as the energy . the translation of a body as a whole merely affects the energy , but not its thermodynamic properties .",
    "however , the rotation of a body as a whole gives rise to centrifugal potential energy that modifies the energies of microstates and has to be carefully incorporated in any thermodynamic investigation ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ marker_rotating_systems ] ; see also appendices [ appd_frames ] and [ appd_rotating_system_0 ] .",
    "we had focused exclusively on the system as a whole without worrying about its internal parts in i. as entropy palys a central role in our development , we discuss the formulation of entropy and thermodynamic averages in sect .",
    "[ marker_averages ] , where we show the entropy itself as a thermodynamic average . under the assumption of internal equilibrium in the system",
    ", there were no relative motions between its various parts that could add additional irreversible processes inside the system . in this work , we will remove this limitation and treat the system @xmath0  as inhomogeneous as glasses normally exhibit both spatial and temporal inhomogeneity ; see @xcite for some recent investigations .",
    "we do this by considering @xmath0 to be composed of a collection of a large number @xmath34 of _ subsystems _",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 which may be different from each other to allow for inhomogeneity and for relative motions and shear forces between different subsystems in terms of internal variables .",
    "each subsystem is still _ macroscopically _ large so that we can introduce a legitimate entropy function @xmath37 ; see sect .",
    "[ marker_inhomogeneous_arbitrary ] for further elaboration .",
    "apart from the _ observables _ that can be manipulated by the observer , there also appear _ internal variables _",
    "often used in describing glasses , as is well known from the early works of davies and jones @xcite .",
    "the latter variables can not be manipulated by the observer and were briefly introduced in i , but not explored .",
    "we will also remedy this situation here and consider glass as an inhomogeneous system with internal variables . specifically",
    ", we treat translations and rotations of various parts of a system as internal variables that are generated by surface traction forces . the alternative approach is to use the traction forces and the strains instead ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological ideology introduced by davies and jones @xcite , which has been recently reviewed by ttinger @xcite , is by now standard and has been discussed in several textbooks ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the observables and internal variables will be collectively called _ state variables _ ; see sect .",

    "[ marker_internal_equilibrium ] , we discuss the consequences of internal equilibrium and its similarity with and differences from the concept of local equilibrium @xcite discussed in sect .",

    "in particular , we argue in the form of theorem [ marker_uniform_motion ] that the system can only sustain a uniform translation and rotation in internal equilibrium .",
    "it is assumed here that there are no additional conditions ( such as the potential flow in a superfluid ) on the velocity .",
    "the proof is trivial but the theorem has far reaching consequences .",
    "for example , it implies that the uniform rotation must be about a principle axis of inertia .",
    "a simple way to understand internal equilibrium is to think of the system as follows .",
    "we first disconnect it form the medium with which it is not in equilibrium , and connect it to another medium whose conjugate field variables ( @xmath38 , etc . )",
    "are exactly the same as that of the system .",
    "the system remains in equilibrium with this medium so that there will be no irreversible process in the system .",

    "we prove that the chemical potential or the affinity associated with an internal variable must be zero when the system is in equilibrium .",
    "we also prove that the entropy expressed solely in terms of observables when there are independent internal variables must explicitly depend on time so that while the system is in internal equilibrium with respect to all state variables , it is not in internal equilibrium with respect to only observables .",
    "a system undergoing uniform translation and rotation is studied in sect . [ marker_rotating_systems ] where we also develop the gibbs fundamental relation for such a system .",

    "we avoid the above issues in the conventional non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite by first identifying the entropy of the system in terms of microstate probabilities as described below , see eq .",

    "this hypothesis is known as the local equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "we add another requirement , that of quasi - independence of the subsystems in our approach , which we believe to be extremely important .",
    "only this requirement ensures that the entropy retains the additivity property and also remains a state variable , as we will discuss later in sect .",
    "[ marker_entropy_additivity ] .      to accommodate relative motion , we need to allow for surface traction forces @xmath62 , which then give rise to internal forces causing the deformation of the system .",

    "( [ internal_energy_balance_eq ] ) .",
    "the use of a probabilistic approach in the determination of the entropy and other statistical properties means that the dynamics in the system must be _ stochastic _ and not deterministic , as the entropy remains constant in a deterministic dynamics @xcite .",

    "<S> starting from the gibbsian formulation of the entropy for @xmath2 , which is valid even when @xmath2 is out of equilibrium , we derive the gibbsian formulation of the entropy of @xmath0 , which need not be in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the additivity of entropy requires _ quasi - independence _ of the subsystems , which requires that the interaction energies between different subsystems must be _ negligible _ so that the energy also becomes additive . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic potentials of subsystems such as the gibbs free energy that continuously decrease during approach to equilibrium are determined by the field parameters ( temperature , pressure , etc . ) of the medium and exist no matter how far the subsystems are out of equilibrium so that their field variables may not even exist . </S>",
    "<S> this and the requirement of quasi - independence make our approach different from the conventional approach due to de groot and others as discussed in the text . as the energy depends on the frame of reference , the thermodynamic potentials and gibbs fundamental relation , but not the entropy , depend on the frame of reference . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of relative motion between subsystems described by their  net linear and angular momenta gives rise to viscous dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of internal equilibrium introduced in i is developed further here and its important consequences are discussed for inhomogeneous systems . the concept of internal variables ( various examples are given in the text ) as variables that can not be controlled by the observer for non - equilibrium evolution is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> they are important because the internal equilibrium in the presence of internal variables is lost if internal variables are not used in thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that their affinity vanishes only in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> gibbs fundamental relation , thermodynamic potentials and irreversible entropy generation are expressed in terms of observables and internal variables . </S>",
    "<S> we use these relations to eventually formulate the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of inhomogeneous systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the case when bodies form an isolated system without any medium to obtain their irreversible contributions and show that this case is no different than when bodies are in an extremely large medium . </S>"
