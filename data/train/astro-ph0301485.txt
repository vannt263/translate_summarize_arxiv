    "the challenge of x - rays in o stars was posed by einstein x - ray observatory observations of the carina nebula ( seward et al .",
    "1979 ; seward and chlebowski , 1982 ) and cyg ob2 ( harnden et al . 1979 ) .",
    "four particularly strong sources were found in tr14 and tr 16 : @xmath0 car itself , hd 93129a , b ( o3 if ) , hd 93162 = wr25 , a wolf - rayet star , and hd 93250 ( o3v ) .",
    "all the bright o stars in the einstein field were detected in x - rays . among the clues to the source of x - rays was that l@xmath1 is approximately seven orders of magnitude smaller than l@xmath4 for all o stars .",
    "the w - r star wr25 is unusually strong in x - rays compared with two other w - r stars in the region .",
    "several x - ray studies have been made subsequently , including rosat images ( corcoran et al .",
    "1995 ) and crowther et al .",
    "( 1995a ) , both of whom confirmed that wr25 is unusually bright for a w - r star .",
    "the region around @xmath0 car is of considerable interest .",
    "@xmath0 car itself is arguably the most massive star in the galaxy , with a history of luminosity variations .",
    "a hubble space telescope image revealed a bipolar structure in the center of the nebula .",
    "the carina nebula contains the most massive stars in the galaxy with initial masses up to 120 m@xmath5 .",
    "walborn ( 1971 ) invented the spectral classification ",
    "o3 \" because several stars in this region are hotter than existing mk classifications .",
    "recent studies include the massey and johnson study ( 1993 , mj93 hereafter ) of reddening from spectroscopy and photometry , and the proper motion study of cudworth et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which provides membership probability .",
    "the clusters tr14 and tr16 provide a snapshot of evolution of the most massive stars known . the evolutionary sequence in order of decreasing mass goes from @xmath0 car through the o3 if star through o3 v stars . a particularly perplexing question in this scenario",
    "is how the w - r star wr25 fits in .",
    "this is discussed at some length by mj93 .",
    "it should be more evolved than the o3 stars ; however , it is less luminous .",
    "this statement , of course , depends on the bolometric corrections , which are difficult to determine for o stars and especially difficult for w - r stars .",
    "wr25 is classified as wn7+abs by mj93 .",
    "wn7+abs stars belong to the nitrogen sequence of w - r stars which are the most luminous and least chemically evolved as mass loss strips off outer layers of the original star .",
    "they still retain some hydrogen , and the  abs \" designation indicates that there are absorption components in the upper balmer lines .",
    "wn7+abs stars differ from of stars only in having a stronger wind . as noted by crowther et al .",
    "( 1995b ) , wn7+abs stars are found only in the youngest clusters , in contrast to wn7 stars .",
    "the scenario put forward by crowther et al .",
    "( 1995 a and b ) , based on their spectroscopy , envisions that wn7+abs stars are part of the most massive sequence of stars , immediately following the evolutionary stage of of stars , but preceding wn7 stars .",
    "( wn8 stars belong to a less massive sequence containing stars which have already been luminous blue variables or red supergiants . )",
    "this scenario accords with the selection of objects in tr16 and tr14 ( wn7+abs , o3 if * , o3 v , and cooler stars ) .",
    "tr 16 and tr 14 contain some of the youngest and most massive stars known , and have been well - studied . for the same reason , many of their parameters are extreme , and also controversial .",
    "the distance , for instance , adopted by davidson and humphreys ( 1997 ) to @xmath0 car itself is 2.3 kpc .",
    "mj93 find 3.2 kpc from extensive spectroscopy and photometry . among the problems in determining the distance",
    "to tr 14 and tr 16 are the form of the reddening law , and whether the two clusters have the same age and distance .",
    "walborn ( 1995 ) illustrates quantitatively how the reddening law affects the derived distance . for r = a@xmath6/e(b - v ) = 3.5 , his distance to tr 16 is 2.5 kpc .",
    "crowther et al .",
    "( 1995b ) use 2.6 kpc in their discussion of the wolf - rayet in tr14 , star wr25 .",
    "we adopt 2.5 kpc for this study .    given the dramatic appearance of the nebulosity in optical images of the cluster ,",
    "the reddening within tr14 and tr16 is surprisingly uniform .",
    "the values of e(b - v ) for the hot stars from mj93 have a scatter of approximately @xmath7 0.2 mag , centered approximately on 0.55 mag .",
    "the form of the reddening law in the region , however , has been debated .",
    "this is discussed further in section 6 .",
    "bolometric corrections are similarly problematic in comparing very luminous hot stars with w - r stars .    a good overview of x - ray studies of o stars and wolf - rayet stars in the pre - chandra era is provided by willis and crowther ( 1996 ) .",
    "the search for correlations between x - ray luminosity and other parameters has been elusive , and is summarized by chlebowski ( 1989 ) .",
    "the observations of @xmath0 car itself from the early chandra image have already been discussed by seward et al .",
    "we now turn to the stars in the surrounding region .",
    "the discussion will be broken into two papers .",
    "the current paper discusses the source counts , the luminosity distributions , and hardness ratios .",
    "the second paper will discuss the low - resolution spectra of the strongest sources .",
    "the current paper is broken up into sections on the observation , detected sources , cool stars , luminosity distributions , x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratios , diffuse emission , upper limits , and hardness ratios .",
    "the early chandra science image placed @xmath0 car at the focus of the i3 chip of the of the acis - i detector .",
    "instrumental details about the chandra satellite are given in weisskopf et al .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath0 car observation was obtained during the period when the energy resolution of the detector was degrading .",
    "it was also obtained at an instrumental temperature which has not been fully calibrated .",
    "this means that the acis instrumental low - resolution spectra have uncertainties in the energy scale .",
    "the intrinsic interest of the sources in this image , however , means that there is insight to be gained from an analysis of the image despite these limitations .",
    "1 shows the image on the acis - i chips .",
    "@xmath0 car itself is near the center of the image , with stars in trumpler 16 particularly prominent to the south .",
    "trumpler 14 is in the extreme upper right .",
    "the identification of several of the sources ( hot stars ) is provided in fig . 1",
    ".    the data were analysed using the cxc ciao ( chandra interactive analysis of observations ) software .",
    "the data were filtered on standard asca grades and checked for times of poor aspect ( pointing stability ) ; none were found .",
    "there were no significant background flares during the observation , giving a total good exposure time of 9.63 ksec .",
    "sources were detected using the wavdetect program which performs a mexican hat wavelet decomposition and reconstruction .",
    "wavdetect was run using scales of size 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 pixels on an image which had been energy filtered to contain data from 300 to 6000 ev .",
    "these choices maximized the number of total detections returned while minimizing the number of spurious detections .",
    "the data were then split into three energy bands : 0.5 - 0.9 , 0.9 - 1.5 , and 1.5 - 2.04 kev .",
    "an exposure map was computed for the observation to take into account vignetting and chip gaps .",
    "a mean energy of 1.2 kev was used in generating the exposure map , which was normalized to its aimpoint value .",
    "source counts were extracted using the regions supplied by wavdetect .",
    "these counts were divided by the normalized mean exposure value , and background - subtracted using data from an annulus centered on the source region .",
    "sources within the background region were subtracted prior to this computation and the area was adjusted accordingly .",
    "the list of detected sources was culled in the following way to produce a list of significant sources .",
    "the distance off - axis for each source was calculated and for this distance the size of the point spread function ( psf ) was determined .",
    "see , for instance , fig .",
    "6.4 in the chandra proposers observatory guide ( 2000 ) .",
    "( specifically , a fit by j. grimes [ 2001 , private communication ] for 80% encircled energy at 1.5 kev was used . )",
    "background counts were measured in two areas of the image and found to be 0.045 counts per square arcsec .",
    "the background within the psf was calculated for each radius . for this background ,",
    "the number of counts required for a 3 @xmath8 detection was computed using the approximate formula from gehrels ( 1986 , p. 339 ,  recommended approximation \" ) .",
    "using this approach , for instance , an on - axis source requires approximately 6 counts to be significant ; a source 7 arcmin off - axis requires approximately 12 counts .",
    "the resulting sources are listed in tables 1 to 4 .",
    "separated by their optical identifications into ob stars ( table 4 of mj93 ) and other sources .",
    "the other sources in table 2 lists are predominately pre - main sequence stars .",
    "sources within the @xmath0 car nebula have been omitted from the tables . as well as",
    "total counts from 0.5 to 2.04 kev , counts were measured in 3 energy bands , 0.5 to 0.9 kev , 0.9 to 1.5 kev , and 1.5 to 2.04 kev , referred to as soft ( s ) , medium ( m ) , and hard ( h ) bands .",
    "errors are computed by dmextract using poisson statistics .",
    "tables 1 and 2 also list the radial distance r from the aimpoint ( in arcmin ) .    tables 3 and 4 list quantities derived from source counts , again divided into ob stars and other sources .",
    "hardness ratios have been calculated from the 3 energy bands :    @xmath9    @xmath10    errors have been propagated from the errors on the energy bands .",
    "in addition , fluxes and luminosities have been calculated from total count rates .",
    "pimms was used to calculate a conversion from counts to energy .",
    "the count rates were calculated on the basis of 9.630 ksec of good time .",
    "a raymond - smith plasma model spectrum with a log temperature of 6.65 was used , a spectrum typical of a stellar source found in young associations .",
    "the extinction is fairly uniform over the field . a column of n@xmath11 of 3 x",
    "10@xmath12 @xmath13 was adopted , corresponding to e(b  v ) = 0.52 mag , which is typical of the field ( mj93 ) . with these parameters , a conversion factor of 1.4",
    "x 10@xmath14 ergs @xmath13 sec@xmath15 per count per sec was derived .",
    "conversion factors differed by less than a factor of two for a range of log t from 6.4 to 7.1 .",
    "luminosities were derived from fluxes using a distance of 2.5 kpc .",
    "figure 2 shows the acis - i image of @xmath0 car overlaid with the detected sources .",
    "extensive optical work has been done on the clusters in the vicinity of @xmath0 car , most recently by mj93 and cudworth , martin , and degioia  eastwood ( 1993 ) .",
    "table 4 in mj93 , the brightest and bluest stars near @xmath0 car , has been used to identify o and b stars with x - ray sources ( shown as circles ) .",
    "sources which are not identified with o and b stars are shown as diamonds .",
    "( note that the increase in the psf of sources which are farther off axis is not reflected in the plotting symbols . )",
    "presumably most of the x - ray sources which are not o stars are pre - main sequence stars , although very rarely they could be background objects , or even extragalactic sources .",
    "figure 3 shows the acis - i image of @xmath0 car with the o and early b stars from the mj93 list marked .",
    "it is clear many of the x - ray sources are early type stars , but many are not .",
    "furthermore , many of the stars on the o and early b star list are not x - ray sources .",
    "figure 4 shows a plot of v magnitude vs spectral type of the o and early b stars from the list of mj93 .",
    "( a few of the hot stars are not plotted because spectral types are not available . )",
    "the observed v magnitude has not been corrected for reddening .",
    "however , extinction is fairly uniform over the field , so the pattern is not changed much if v@xmath16 is used instead .",
    "an exception to this statement is the o3 star at 10.78 mag .",
    "this star was recognized by mj93 to be unusually heavily reddened ( mj 257 ) , and will be discussed further below .",
    "the 06.5 star which is shown as not detected lies in the extreme upper right corner of the acis - i image ( fig . 1 or 2 ) , considerably off - axis , where a modest source could easily fail our detection criterion . with this exception ,",
    "the dividing line between detections and nondetections is very sharp at just approximately b0 .",
    "this confirms previous results for o stars .",
    "there is one b1.5 star which is detected in x - rays .",
    "a sole exception like this could easily result from a later companion .",
    "it will be discussed in section 10.3 .",
    "figure 5 shows the total x - ray counts ( table 1 ) as a function of spectral type for the hot stars .",
    "the field corresponding to the chandra image of @xmath0 car was observed january 9 - 10 , 2001 using the 0.9 meter telescope at ctio .",
    "the tek-2k ccd has a 13.5  field of view .",
    "first , four pointings , arrayed in a cruciform pattern with @xmath0 carina near the edge of each field , were used to observe the entire field .",
    "johnson b and v filters and a kron - cousins i filter were used , with exposures of 2 minutes each .",
    "this gives a limiting magnitude of about 19 at v. we performed an additional exposure of 10 minutes with each filter , centered on @xmath0 carina .",
    "this gave us a limiting magnitude of about 20.5 at v within 6.75  of the aimpoint .",
    "basic data reduction was handled using the quadproc package within iraf to bias correct and flat - field the data .",
    "fluxes for all standards and target stars were determined using the fitpsf tool within the iraf apphot package . using this tool fluxes",
    "were derived from the analytic fit to each individual psf in lieu of simple aperture photometry .",
    "stellar magnitudes and colors were put on the standard system using the photcal package .",
    "there were three difficulties encountered during data analysis .",
    "first , the region has a highly variable diffuse background .",
    "second , @xmath0 carina and other bright stars make photometric measurements of stars in their proximity difficult . finally the region is quite crowded , and often faint stars have overlapping psfs .",
    "optical data are presented in table 5 , ordered by source number from tables 2 and 4 .",
    "problems are noted , as appropriate according to the code at the end of the table .",
    "photometric errors were determined using fits to the standard stars and by comparing observed values of target stars observed multiple times in separate pointings .",
    "this gives a more realistic assessment of the errors given the highly variable and confused nature of the field .",
    "errors are less than 5% at v and less than 8.3 % in the colors down to the completeness limits .",
    "these errors are somewhat conservative because a star near the center of one field is on the edge of the comparison field , thus the psfs may differ greatly .    the central image with the x - ray sources overlaid is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the resulting color magnitude diagram is shown in figure 7 . in this figure ,",
    "x  ray sources near trumpler 16 are shown as asterisks , those near trumpler 14 are shown as open circles .",
    "other sources are shown as small dots .",
    "there are 6219 stars plotted .",
    "all stars detected in b , v , and i and brighter than our completeness limit in the deep center field exposure are plotted .",
    "7 shows no significant difference between the age inferred for the trumpler 16 sources compared with those near trumpler 14 , although the statistics are small .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the color  magnitude diagram easily distinguishes stars of carina arm of the galaxy from nearby stars .",
    "the x - ray sources are all in a band about 1 magnitude wide , located about one magnitude above the field stars in the carina arm .",
    "the well defined sequence of field stars ( dots ) results because they , like the cluster stars , are concentrated in the carina arm .",
    "heavy obscuration behind the clusters restricts background contamination .",
    "the large spread among the stars is similar to that seen in orion and is common among stars less than 1 myr old when small differences in age can lead to large differences in luminosity .",
    "about 100 stars in this region of the hr diagram are not detected in x - rays .",
    "there are a few x - ray sources about 0.75 magnitudes above the upper envelope of the x  ray population ; we interpret these as binary stars .",
    "the reddest stars have v - i of about 2 .",
    "given a@xmath6 = 1.95 , the dereddened v - i at the v=19 is 1.28 . at an age of 1 myr , this corresponds to a mass of about 1.15 m@xmath17 ( baraffe et al .",

    "might be included , as could any extra - galactic objects , but fig .",
    "9 is heavily dominated by late type stars .",
    "the luminosity distribution is distinctly different between these two groups .",
    "most of the ob stars have luminosities greater than 10@xmath18 ergs s@xmath15 .",
    "the cooler stars have luminosities strongly peaked at 10@xmath18 ergs s@xmath15 , with the luminosity distribution of cool stars ( fig .",
    "9 ) truncated at the faint end because of the relatively shallow x - ray image . as discussed below in section 8",
    ", the depth of the x - ray exposure allowed all o stars near the image center to be detected .",
    "in this section we explore the efficiency of x - ray production from hot stars ( table 6 ) .",
    "the first column is the optical identification , taken from table 4 of mj93 .",
    "the second column is the x - ray source number from table 3 .",
    "columns 3 and 5 are the v and e(b - v ) ( in magnitudes ) , again from mj93 .",
    "column 4 is the spectral type .",
    "the reader is referred to table 4 in mj93 for the comparison of spectral types from different sources and in some cases more complex spectral types .",
    "recently walborn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have comprehensively reexamined the spectral classification of luminous stars .",
    "they make small adjustments to some classifications , including introducing new classes o2 and o3.5 .",
    "the new classifications for stars in table 5 are hd93129a : o2 if * , hd93129b : o3.5 v((f+ ) ) hd93250 : o3.5 v((f+ ) ) , hd93205 : o3.5 v((f+ ) ) , and hde303308 : o4 v((f+ ) ) .",
    "this finer gradation would only mildly affect the figures below .",
    "the sixth column is the bolometric magnitude , taken from table 3 in massey et al .",
    "( 2001 ) where available , made fainter by 0.56 mag because of the different distance assumed .",
    "( the x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio which we use below , of course , does not depend on the distance . ) for other stars , bolometric corrections were computed from the same formulae ( massey et al .",
    "the final column is the log of the ratio of x - ray luminosity to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "some of the sources in table 6 have been identified in fig . 1 .",
    "while the reddening through the cluster field is reasonably uniform ( mj93 ) , there been studies that have suggested that the reddening law is unusual ( e.g. herbst , 1976 ) .",
    "other studies have refuted this , or concluded that only some objects have unusual reddening laws ( turner and moffatt , 1980 ; tapia et al .",
    "1988 ) .    one case where the reddening law does appear to be unusual is the w - r star hd 93162 = wr25 , although the unusual spectrum of the w - r star presents a problem in reddening determination .",
    "crowther et al .",
    "( 1995b ) discuss the flux distribution from iue through the ir and conclude that the reddening law for wr25 is unusual [ e(b - v ) = 0.66 with r = 4.6 ] .",
    "this is the reddening that we adopt .",
    "the unusual spectrum also complicates the determination of the bolometric correction .",
    "we adopt the bolometric magnitude from crowther et al .",
    "( 1995a ) , -10.1 mag .",
    "( a small correction has been included for the difference between the distance they use and the one used here . )",
    "there are a few unusual stars among the hot x - ray sources .",
    "tr 16 - 244 is a faint star with an early spectral type ( o3-o4 if ) .",
    "mj93 took particular care in their observations because of this , and because the star lies close to the bright w - r star hd 93162 .",
    "tr 16 - 244 is marked in fig . 1 ,",
    "and the w - r star is just to the right .",
    "the reddening implied for tr 16 - 244 by the spectral type and photometry of mj93 is larger than other stars in the cluster , with e(b - v ) = 0.94 mag ( using the relations in massey et al .",
    "2000 ) . tr16 - 244 and hd",
    "93162 both lie very close to the band of obscuration in the visual image . however , the w - r star is between tr16 - 244 and the dust lane . while reddening is difficult to determine for w - r stars , the value found by crowther et al .",
    "( 1995b ) for the total extinction in the visual of the wolf - rayet star , ( a@xmath6 = 3.0 mag ) is very close to that for tr16 - 244 .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether the large reddening for those two stars is caused by the dust lane , or could have a circumstellar component ( for each star ) . for tr 16 - 244",
    ", since the spectral type is the same as for hd 93129ab , the same temperature and bolometric correction were used in creating table 6 .",
    "the resulting m@xmath4 is -8.6 mag , although there are obviously several sources of uncertainty in this number .",
    "the other hot star with surprising photometry is tr16 - 22 .",
    "the v magnitude is faint for a spectral type of o8.5 v , suggesting a high reddening .",
    "tr16 - 22 is very close to the dust lane that cuts diagonally through the lower left of the image ( fig .",
    "1 ) , so the foreground absorption may be particularly large for this star .",
    "the spectrum mj93 show is similar to other o8.5 v spectra , except that the lines are slightly shallower and broader .",
    "however , the value of q from the photometry gives rather unconvincing values for temperature and bolometric correction .",
    "comparing the b - v and u - b values from mj93 with those of herbst ( 1976 ) and feinstein ( 1969 ) shows that the agreement between the latter two is much better .",
    "for this reason , we adopt e(b - v ) = 0.78 mag from the mean b - v and q of herbst and feinstein . this provides a bolometric magnitude very close to the two o8.5 v stars tr16 - 115 and tr16 - 3 , so we adopt the bolometric magnitude from these stars ( -6.8 mag ) .",
    "10 shows the l@xmath1/l@xmath4 ratio for the stars in table 6 as a function of spectral type .",
    "an approximate adjustment to the x - ray luminosities of hd 93162 , tr 16 - 244 , and tr 16 - 22 of a factor 2.45 was made because of their larger reddening which would correspond to an e(b - v ) = 0.90 mag ( estimated using pimms ) .",
    "as is known from previous studies , for most stars in the o and early b spectral range , the l@xmath1/l@xmath4 ratio remains constant at -7 .",
    "there are 3 exceptions to this in fig .",
    "the w - r star hd 93162 has been known since the x - ray discovery paper ( seward et al .",
    "1979 ) to be unusually strong in x - rays as compared with other w - r stars .",
    "this has been particularly surprising as it has been thought to be a single star .",
    "binaries with components this massive are often colliding wind binaries and hence stronger x - ray sources than single stars .",
    "however , the recent w - r catalogue by van der hucht ( 2001 ) lists for the first time a possible binary indicator ,  diluted emission lines \" . a companion bright enough to be detected",
    "photometrically would probably be luminous enough to have a wind which would enhance x - ray production .",
    "tr16 - 22 ( source 55 ) also has an unusually large x - ray luminosity in comparison with its bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath1/l@xmath19 -5.8 ) .",
    "as noted above , it has a larger than average absorption , possibly because it is on the edge of the dust lane .",
    "however , the large x - ray luminosity suggests the source itself may have unusual characteristics beyond simple foreground reddening .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the source ( l@xmath1 = 7.9 @xmath7 0.5 x 10@xmath18 erg sec@xmath15 in table 3 before the adjustment for high reddening ) makes it one of the brightest o stars observed , approximately a factor of 10 larger than other o8.5 v stars .",
    "the third source with a large l@xmath1/l@xmath4 ratio is tr16 - 11 , the b1.5 v star ( source 141 in table 1 ) .",
    "fig 10 shows that a b star would not even be detected unless it is unusually strong in x - rays . the luminosity ( l@xmath1 = 1.4 @xmath7 0.5 x 10@xmath18 erg sec@xmath15 ) is within the range of the cool star distribution ( fig .",
    "9 ) so a late companion is a possibility . mj93",

    "the spread in l@xmath1/l@xmath4 ratio in fig .",
    "9 is particularly large among the o3 stars .",
    "the two with the largest ratio are hd 93250 and tr 16 - 244 .",
    "the x - ray production in cool stars was similarly investigated using the x - ray luminosity ( table 4 ) and the optical luminosity from the data in table 5 . in this case , the typical extinction for the clusters [ e(b  v ) = 0.52 mag ] was assumed for all the cool stars , as was the standard distance .",
    "bolometric corrections were interpolated table 15.3.1 in _ astrophysical quantities _ ( cox , 1998 ) .",
    "the v - i ( johnson ) in that table was transformed to the kron - cousins system using the equations provided by bessell ( 1979 ) .",

    "the colors of a0v , f0 v , and k7 v stars ( from bessell , 1979 ) are shown with the reddening of the clusters .",
    "note that in this relatively short exposure we only detect a fraction of the stars in the cluster .",

    "it is parameterized as a function of the number of background counts , which is a function of the off - axis distance .",
    "we have compared the measured counts at the positions of the o and b stars in mj94 ( table 4 ) which are not in table 1 with the detection level predicted by the gehrels criterion .",
    "counts were measured in 2@xmath315 circles centered on these positions .",
    "for the center of the field , this is a generous allowance for the psf ( 0@xmath3168 ) plus an uncertainty in the pointing of 1 \" .",
    "figure 15 shows that the measured counts are typically well below the detection criterion .",

    ", one background count corresponds to a detection limit of 4 source counts .",
    "as summarized in fig 15 , the gehrels criterion provides a conservative upper limit for sources concealed in the measured counts .",
    "further from the axis , the psf , and hence the included background counts , increase .",
    "for comparison with the detection criterion , counts for locations greater than 7 off axis were measured in circles of 5 `` and 10 '' radius as well as 2@xmath315 ( not shown in fig 15 ) . for radii less than 10 off axis , the psf is less than 10 `` .",
    "counts in the 10 '' circles for several of the off - axis locations are above the detection criterion . as discussed below , there are probably actually sources at several of these locations .",
    "we note also that the tr 14 region is a dense and complex one , and it is highly likely that additional sources are included as the measurement area is increased . because of this complexity",
    ", further discussion of the upper limits far off axis does not seem warranted .    with these explorations in mind ,",
    "we adopt the gehrels limit as the upper limit of counts at the location of early b stars .",
    "the measured counts at the location of o and b stars from mj93 table 4 ( which are not detected sources ) is listed in table 7 . for each location ,",
    "table 7 provides the number ( independent from the numbering in tables 1 to 4 ) , the position , the counts in the source and background areas , and the net counts , all with their errors .",

    "even though the measures will be  over - corrected \" for background , the tr 14 stars have predominately positive source counts .",
    "this indicates that the central concentration in the psf is such that a number of tr 14 stars in fact are probably x - ray sources , even though they do not pass the detection criterion .",
    "fig 17 shows the upper limit luminosity from table 6 for hot stars not detected in x - rays as a function of spectral type .",
    "the two o stars which were not detected have comparatively high upper limits because they are at the edge of the image .",

    "this upper limit only overlaps with the weakest sources in the distribution of x - ray luminosities ( fig 9 ) .",
    "while we would not yet have detected a companion comparable to the faintest x - ray sources among late type cluster members , we can say that the b stars do not have x - ray bright companions .",
    "the hardness ratios of x - ray sources provide the simplest description of their spectra . in this section",
    ", we explore the hardness ratios ( tables 3 and 4 ) as defined in section 2 for both hot stars and other x - ray sources .",
    "we limit the sources examined to the brightest so the errors in the ratios are small enough so that they do not obscure any trends or comparisons .",
    "we have examined the distribution of errors in the hardness ratios as a function of luminosity . for the o - b stars ( table 3 ) , if we use only sources with log l@xmath1 @xmath35 32.2 ergs sec@xmath15 , the uncertainty in the soft hardness ratio , hr@xmath36 is less than or equal to 0.1 ( with one exception ) ; for the hard hardness ratio , hr@xmath37 , the error is less than or equal to 0.15 .",
    "the other stars ( table 4 , referred to as cool stars below ) are somewhat weaker in x - rays than the hot stars , so we use sources with log lum @xmath35 32.0 ergs sec@xmath15 .",
    "this results in uncertainties less than 0.2 in both colors ( after two sources with large errors were removed from the sample ) .",
    "our sample is thus limited to only the brightest sources .",
    "fig 18 shows the resulting hardness ratio plot .",
    "the hardness ratio created from the soft and medium bands ( 0.5 to 0.9 kev , 0.9 to 1.5 kev ) can be either positive or negative , i.e. , either band can have more counts whereas the hardness ratio from the medium and hard band ( 1.5 to 2.04 kev ) is always negative , i.e. the hard band always has fewer counts .",
    "the hot stars fall in a diagonal sequence with a scatter consistent with the uncertainties in the colors .",
    "there are only two cool stars with well determined hardness ratios , which are both are very hard in fig .",
    "we have explored this locus further by creating hardness ratios in the same bands using pimms ( v3.2 ) . the basic model ( solid line in fig 18 )",
    "is a raymond - smith model with solar abundance and a temperature range from log t = 6.0 to 7.2 . a neutral column density n@xmath11 = 3 x 10@xmath12 cm @xmath22 was used corresponding to the typical extinction for the field e(b - v ) = 0.52 mag .",
    "for two temperatures , n@xmath11 was increased to 5 x 10@xmath12 cm @xmath22 , corresponding to e(b - v ) = 0.9 mag , an extreme value found for a few stars in the field .",
    "the result of this difference in extinction is shown in fig 18 .",
    "for comparison , we have computed hardness ratios for 0.2 solar abundance ( dashed line in fig .",
    "we have also computed models for thermal bremsstrahlung ( kt from 0.2 to 1.0 kev ) .",
    "fig 18 shows that a range of hrs ( the soft ratios ) can be obtained with any of the models .",
    "however , the observed ratios for both hot and cool stars lie systematically at larger ( harder ) values of hrh than the computed values for either raymond - smith plasma or bremsstrahlung . although the bremsstrahlung ratios for the hottest temperature match the ratios for the hot stars , for cooler temperatures they are a poorer match than the raymond - smith models .",
    "based on these models , the hrs values for the hot stars indicate a range of temperatures from approximately 3 x 10@xmath38 to more than 10@xmath39 .    how are these x - ray hardness ratios related to the optical ( photospheric ) properties of the stars ? in fig 18 , the 3 hot stars with negative hr@xmath36 are hde 303308 [ e(b - v ) = 0.46 mag ; o3 v ] , hd93205 [ e(b - v ) = 0.40 mag ; o3 v ] , and -59@xmath402600 [ e(b - v ) = 0.51 mag ; o6 v ] . in other words ,",
    "all three have reddening typical of the field .",
    "the stars with hr@xmath36 near 0.1 are hd 93250 [ e(b - v ) = 0.49 mag ; o3 v ] and hd 93160 [ e(b - v ) = 0.31 mag ; o6 iii ] . interpreting the hardness ratios in terms of photospheric temperature arrives at the contradiction that the x - ray temperatures are hotter than the o3 v stars in the first group , although the photospheric temperatures are similar or cooler .",
    "the four hot stars with distinctly harder hr@xmath36 are tr 16 - 22 ( o8.5 v , e(b - v ) = 0.78 mag ) , tr 16 - 244 ( o3 i , e(b - v ) = 0.94 mag ) , hd 93129ab ( o3 i , e(b - v ) = 0.55 mag ) , hd 93162 = wr 25 ( wn7 + abs , e(b - v ) = 0.66 mag ) .",
    "none of these are normal main sequence objects .",
    "hd 93129ab and tr 16 - 22 are both among the hottest stars known ( o3 ) , and also very luminous . the fact that hd 93129ab apparently has the normal reddening for tr 14 suggests that the very hard hrh ratio does not result from circumstellar material .",
    "this is in contrast to tr 16 - 244 which has the same temperature and luminosity , but is more heavily reddened that the average cluster member .",
    "both hd 93162 and tr 16 - 22 stand out in fig .",
    "10 because they have a particularly large l@xmath1/l@xmath4 .",
    "we already know that hd 93162 is unusual , since not only has it evolved to be a very early stage in the wolf - rayet sequence , it is also unusually x - ray luminous for a wolf - rayet star .",
    "tr 16 - 22 , on the other hand , is cooler and fainter than stars evolving off the main sequence in the clusters .",
    "its unusually hard and bright x - ray luminosity must be linked with some unusual property , such as a massive binary companion .",
    "the two cool stars with well - determined hardness ratios are both among the hardest stars in the field .",
    "interestingly , one is located within the range of the cool pre - main sequence stars in fig . 7 , but one is one of the x - ray bright a stars .",
    "fig 19 confirms that the hrs ( the soft hardness ratio ) is not correlated with photospheric temperature indicated by spectral type .",
    "the o3 stars , in particular , cover a very large range in hrs .",
    "how do we interpret the hardness ratios of the x - ray sources in tr 14 and tr 16 ?",
    "there seem to be two important considerations .",
    "first , we are looking at a biased sample .",
    "because we have restricted the sample to sources with reasonably well determined ratios , we are only looking at the most luminous sources .",
    "second , both the hot and cool stars have more counts in the hard band than predicted from the simple pimms calculations .",
    "a plausible interpretation for this is that we have used a one temperature model in the calculations , but the sources may actually have a second harder component .",
    "this is frequently seen in spectral fits of stellar sources .",
    "we note that the discussion of the individual sources above rules out single parameter explanations of the hardness based on photospheric temperatures or circumstellar reddening . in summary ,",
    "unusually x - ray bright sources are surprisingly hard .",
    "we have assembled the x - ray properties of sources in tr 14 and tr 16 , including several sources which are unusually strong or hard in x - rays .",
    "we have already discussed properties such as reddening , spectral type and luminosity in relation to the x - ray properties .",
    "one further property ( at least ) may be important in x - ray production , namely whether the star is single , a member of a close binary system , or a member of a wide binary system .    in o stars , a binary companion with sufficient mass to drive a wind of its own may enhance x - ray production in via a  colliding wind \" . a good deal of work has been done to establish whether the stars in the carina clusters are single or multiple .",
    "the most definitive study , with the highest resolution spectra , is that of penny et al .",
    "they concluded that none of the six bright members of tr 14 are short - period spectroscopic binaries .",
    "this is in contrast to an earlier study at lower resolution by levato et al .",
    "( 1991b ) . however , the penny work , and a later study by garcia et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , demonstrate that tr 14 is surprisingly deficient in short - period binaries among the hottest stars .",
    "penny et al . suggest that the cluster has remained compact because the lack of binaries lowers the cluster heating via binary - binary interactions , although the results come from , of course , only the brightest stars .",
    "velocity studies of 26 stars in tr 16 were carried out by levato et al .",
    "( 1991a ) , using the same equipment used for the tr 14 study , with relatively low resolution ( 43  mm@xmath15 ) .",
    "they found velocity variation in at least 50% of the stars studied .",
    "the work by this team in tr 14 was superceded by higher resolution work , and the radial velocity variations they found in tr 16 need to be confirmed",
    ". it would be quite surprising to have dramatically different binary fractions in the two clusters .",

    "2001 ) with an orbital period of 6.1 days and spectral types of o3 v and o8 v , is not a particularly strong x - ray source .",
    "cpd -59@xmath40 2635 is also a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( colombo et al . 2001 ) , with a period of 2.3 days and spectral types o8 v and o9.5 v , and again is not a particularly strong x - ray source .",
    "cpd -59@xmath40 2636 is a similar case of a multiple system with two short period binaries ( albacete colombo et al .",
    "2002 ) , but an unremarkable x - ray flux . in summary ,",
    "the two with particularly hard spectra ( hd 93129ab and hd 93250 ) may well not be binaries . on the other hand three sources in short period binaries made up of o star components ( hd 93205 , cpd -59@xmath40 2635 , and cpd -59@xmath40 2636 ) are not particularly remarkable x - ray sources .",
    "the emerging picture is that while close binaries with two hot stars may produce a strong x - ray flux ( the colliding wind model ) , this does not seem to be the whole explanation for surprisingly strong x - ray sources .",
    "clearly there is the standard problem that there is almost never enough information to prove that a star is single .",
    "however , it is short period binaries with massive companions that should be colliding wind systems , and they are the easiest to find . with the incomplete velocity evidence that is available ,",
    "strong sources and binary orbits are nearly anti - correlated .",
    "we suspect this demonstrates that our knowledge of binary systems is incomplete .",
    "hd 93162 = wr 25 , and hd 93250 are surprisingly strong in x - rays , but with only indirect suggestions of a binary companion .",
    "should it turn out that the x - ray strength does come from a companion , this would provide an important way to get more complete statistics on the binary fraction in massive stars , since such strong x - ray sources are not overlooked .",
    "chlebowski and garmany ( 1991 ) provide comparisons of x - ray flux and stellar parameters such as wind velocity and luminosity for an extensive list of o stars .",
    "they find that in general binaries do not produce larger mass loss than single stars .",
    "on the other hand , close binaries seem to produce more x - ray flux than either contact binaries or wider binaries .",
    "one way to reconcile these trends with the apparent lack of correlation between binary status in table 8 and excess x - ray flux is that we are sampling regimes where different effects become dominant .",
    "this is particularly likely for the group of extreme stars found in the carina nebula : the most massive , the most luminous .",
    "for instance , for the most massive stars , extreme mass loss rates may dominate over binary - single trends and produce an unusually large x - ray flux . for stars less massive than o3 stars ,",
    "the effect of a close binary with a massive companion may become evident in the x - ray flux .      as summarized above",
    ", there is no _ velocity _ evidence the hd 93250 is a short period binary system , although there are suspicions that it might have a companion from line - width variations and line depths .",
    "however the recent reexamination by walborn et al .",
    "stress line depth in the context of luminosity not companions .",
    "this paper stresses that complications in the interpretation of these extreme stars because of binary companions must be understood using milky way examples .",
    "even though there are many examples in the magellanic clouds , observations are typically contaminated by a surrounding cluster . if hd 93250 is single ( and there is no clear evidence at present against this ) , it is a pivotal object in understanding the x - ray production and evolution of very massive stars .",
    "it is an extremely strong ( and also hard )",
    "x - ray source in comparison with other o3 stars . among the tr 14 and tr 16 stars",
    "it has a v magnitude second only to hd 93129ab ( mj93 ) .",
    "the hardness ratio hrs , however , lies between the softer o3 stars and the harder but unusual and more luminous hd 93129ab and tr 16 - 244 .",
    "if x - ray flux of hd 93250 is not affected by a companion , it provides a benchmark of an extremely luminous main sequence dwarf with a very high l@xmath1/l@xmath4 produced by the outer atmosphere processes of the star itself .",
    "since it will presumably accelerate its mass loss as it evolves off the main sequence , it provides an important example of high x - ray production of a star before its mass loss becomes extreme .",
    "there is another regime in which x - ray observations provide an important handle on the binary fraction in massive stars .",
    "the upper limits to x - rays from b stars ( fig .",
    "17 ) apply also to the x - ray flux from a cool companion . for instance , the upper limit to the luminosity ( log l@xmath1 = 30.8 ergs sec@xmath42 ) would pick up many of the cool star x - ray sources in the orion nebula cluster ( feigelson , et al .",
    "in other words , a deeper image could rule out most cool companions . quantifying how what fraction of companions would be detected at a given sensitivity level",
    ", however , is not easy .",
    "we can estimate from fig 10 of feigelson , et al . that less than a quarter of the orion cool stars would be detected with the sensitivity limit of our @xmath0 car image ( including a small approximate correction to account for absorption in orion )",
    ". however , fig . 12 in feigelson ,",
    "impiles that companions of a and late b stars have a higher luminosity than the average cool star .",
    "that is , for a given sensitivity limit , a larger fraction of companions would be detected than estimated from the luminosity distribution of late type stars . accurately identifying binary companions much less massive than the primary is very difficult to do , particularly for massive b stars with only a few broad lines to measure velocities from .",
    "x - ray studies provide detection of this otherwise elusive population of companions .",
    "the emerging picture of colliding wind binaries is that they include systems with widely separated components , as well as systems with close components .",
    "wr 140 with an orbital period of 8 years is an example .",
    "our summary of velocity information about binaries in table 8 , and the discussion in section 10.1 indicate that the relation between binary status and strong x - rays is not simple .",
    "the recent xmm - newton spectrum of the wolf rayet star wr 110 ( skinner et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests yet another complication in interpretation .",
    "they find a cool soft component to the spectrum , as expected from a wind - shock model , and in addition , they find a hard x - ray component .",
    "they examine a number of possibilities for producing this component and conclude that it can be produced by a wind and a close but as yet undetected companion . however ,",
    "if the companion is not found , they suggest the possibility that the hard component is produced by the wolf rayet star itself .",

    "tr 16 - 244 , a heavily reddened o3 i star , and tr 16 - 22 , a heavily reddened o8.5 v star have surprisingly large x - ray fluxes .",
    "they are both close to the dust lanes which cross the sides of the cluster and which may be responsible for the above average reddening .",
    "@xmath43 several stars have an unusually large l@xmath1/l@xmath4 .",
    "hd 93162 , a wolf - rayet star , has long been known to have an even higher l@xmath1/l@xmath4 than other wolf - rayet stars .",
    "there is some indication that it may be a binary , which could account for this .",
    "tr 16 - 22 also stands out in l@xmath1/l@xmath4 , perhaps indicating a colliding wind binary , although there are no radial velocity studies to provide further information .",
    "the third star with a large l@xmath1/l@xmath4 is tr16 - 11 , the b1.5 star .",
    "the x - ray flux may be produced by a second cool star .",
    "@xmath43 we have put upper limits on the ob stars in the field which we do not detect . for comparison , in this short exposure , if companions to the b stars had an x - ray luminosity distribution like the late type stars in the orion nebula cluster , we would detect only a fraction of the companions .",
    "@xmath43 we discuss the hardness ratios of the brightest sources in bands 0.5 to 0.9 kev , 0.9 to 1.5 kev , and 1.5 to 2.04 kev , though the sample is limited to only the brightest sources .",
    "hardness ratios are not correlated in a simple way with photospheric temperature ( spectral type ) .",
    "both hot and cool stars lie parallel to a locus derived for an isothermal plasma , however there is an offset indicating extra counts in the highest energy band",
    ". this could be due to a second component at a higher temperature , at least for these very luminous sources .",

    "<S> the region around the @xmath0 car nebula has three ob associations , which contain a wolf - rayet star and several massive o3 stars . </S>",
    "<S> an early chandra acis - i image was centered on @xmath0 car and includes trumpler 16 and part of trumpler 14 . </S>",
    "<S> the chandra image confirms the well - known result that o and very early b stars are x - ray sources with l@xmath1 @xmath2 10@xmath3 l@xmath4 over an x - ray luminosity range of about 100 . </S>",
    "<S> two new anomalously strong x - ray sources have been found among the hot star population , tr 16 - 244 , a heavily - reddened o3 i star , and tr 16 - 22 , a heavily - reddened o8.5 v star . </S>",
    "<S> two stars have an unusually large l@xmath1/l@xmath4 : hd 93162 , a wolf - rayet star ( and possible binary ) , and tr 16 - 22 , a possible colliding wind binary . in addition , a population of sources associated with cool stars is detected . in the color - magnitude diagram , these x - ray sources sit above the sequence of field stars in the carina arm . </S>",
    "<S> the ob stars are on average more x - ray luminous than the cool star x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray sources among a stars have similar x - ray luminosities to cooler stars , and may be due to cooler companions . </S>",
    "<S> upper limits are presented for b stars which are not detected in x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> these upper limits are also the upper limits for any cool companions which the hot stars may have . </S>",
    "<S> hardness ratios are presented for the most luminous sources in bands 0.5 to 0.9 kev , 0.9 to 1.5 kev , and 1.5 to 2.04 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the available information on the binary nature of the hot stars is discussed , but binarity does not correlate with x - ray strength in a simple way . </S>"
