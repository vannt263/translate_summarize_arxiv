    "the distance to a classical nova in the galaxy is best inferred by comparing the angular size of the resolved nova shell with the size calculated from its rate of expansion and the time since the shell was ejected . however ,",
    "if nova shells are ellipsoids of revolution ( spheroids ) rather than spherical , then the concept of `` angular size '' is ambiguous , and the expansion velocity along the line of sight does not correspond to the transverse expansion velocity .",
    "thus the use of formulas that are valid in the spherical case will lead to erroneous distance estimates .",
    "individual distance estimates may be too large or too small , depending on the true axis ratio of the nova shell and its inclination to the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , these errors do not necessarily average toward zero when ensemble averages are taken . in this paper , we consider systematic errors in estimates of nova shell expansion distances , and recommend procedures to minimize the errors .      as with all classes of astronomical objects ,",
    "our understanding of the classical nova phenomenon depends on having accurate estimates of the distances of these objects . in turn , having a well - founded understanding of the distances and luminosities of novae allows them to be studied as astrophysical objects and to be exploited for other purposes .",
    "the need for accurate distances is evident , both for novae taken individually and for novae used collectively , i.e. , in a statistical fashion . an accurate distance to an individual nova , combined with good coverage of the outburst light curve and a knowledge of the interstellar extinction ,",
    "can allow the theory of the nova outburst to be verified and further developed .",
    "for example , it is possible to check whether there is a phase after maximum light during which the nova s luminosity is close to the eddington limit .",
    "all inferences about the mass of the shell that is ejected during the outburst depend on some power of the distance , through establishing the volume occupied by the emitted gas . at late stages in the evolution of a nova , when the shell can be resolved from the central binary star , the distance is needed to convert the angular size of the shell into a linear size , so that the physical conditions in the ejected gas ( ionization , excitation ) can be related to the ionizing flux from the central white dwarf ( the post - nova ) and its accretion disk .",
    "an accurate distance to a classical nova also allows the modeling of the accretion process in the post - nova system ; without a distance constraint ( leading to a constraint on the luminosity ) , it has proven impossible to infer uniquely the mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf ( wade 1988 , wade & hubeny 1998 )",
    ".    treated collectively , novae have the possibility of providing a secondary or even primary distance indicator for the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "since novae are present in galaxies of all hubble types , they have the potential to be used directly to compare and unite the distance scales of spiral and elliptical galaxies . the so - called maximum magnitude  rate of decline ( mmrd ) relation gives the visual absolute magnitude at maximum light , from a measurement of the rate of decline after maximum ( or equivalently the time taken to decline 2 or 3 magnitudes ) .",
    "the shape of the mean mmrd curve and the dispersion around this mean relation have been found from observations in external galaxies ( e.g. , della valle & livio 1995 ) .",
    "for the mmrd relation to be a primary distance indicator , however , the zero - point calibration must be provided by galactic novae .",
    "another proposed distance indicator is the absolute magnitude at 15 days past maximum light ( @xmath0 ) , where the dispersion in absolute magnitude is small for all novae taken without regard to speed class . the same remarks about zero - point calibration apply to this method . at maximum for her",
    "best observed novae , assuming that they had _ identical _ @xmath0 ; this step should be replaced by actually measuring the dispersion in @xmath0 . ]",
    "even the nearest galactic novae are generally too distant for direct trigonometric parallax measurements . instead",
    ", indirect methods of distance estimation are often used , based on the galactic rotation curve , the total amount of interstellar reddening , the presence or absence of discrete components ( `` clouds '' ) in interstellar absorption lines , etc .",
    "the only geometrical ( hence fundamental ) method is that of `` expansion distance '' ( also referred to as `` expansion parallax '' ) , in which the measured angular size of the resolved nova shell is compared with the linear size of the shell ; the latter is calculated from the expansion speed of the shell gas and the known time since the outburst . in her work on the mmrd relation , cohen ( 1985 ) had only eleven novae with well - observed expansion distances and suitable coverage of their light curves .",
    "this is largely because the surface brightness of a nova shell declines rapidly with time since outburst , so that by the time the shell is large enough to be resolved from the ground , it is often too faint to observe . since cohen s study , several additional novae have had good light curve coverage , and expansion distances may become available for these from ground - based observations and especially from the _ hubble space telescope _ , since the latter can resolve some shells within a few months or years of the outburst .",
    "the simplest way to derive an expansion distance is to assume ( often implicitly ) that the nova shell is expanding spherically symmetrically , hence that the transverse velocity of gas in the plane of the sky is the same as the radial velocity of gas moving directly along the line of sight .",
    "what if the ejection of the shell is asymmetric ? to be specific ,",
    "suppose the shell expands as a spheroid , the simplest generalization from the spherically symmetric case , and one that suffices to describe many actual nova shells .",
    "first , the projected image of the nova shell will not be circular for most orientations , and thus there will be an ambiguity in what is meant by angular size .",
    "second , the maximum velocity along the line of sight will usually not correspond to _ either _ the `` polar '' or `` equatorial '' expansion velocity . for example , suppose that the angular size is taken to be the largest projected `` radius '' of the nova shell , which is perhaps the easiest size parameter to estimate on a barely resolved image",
    ". if all nova shells were oblate , then the calculated expansion distance ( based on the assumption of spherical symmetry ) would always be less than the true distance , because the line - of - sight velocity would be smaller than the transverse expansion velocity . the resulting nova distance scale would be too short . on the other hand ,",
    "if all nova shells are prolate , than the distance to an individual object may be underestimated or overestimated , depending on the orientation and the ratio of major and minor axes .",
    "while it is clear that the distance to an individual nova can be in error as a result , it was not made clear until the work of ford & ciardullo ( 1988 ; hereinafter fc88 ) that in the prolate case , a systematic error might remain , even after averaging over an ensemble of novae that are taken to be randomly oriented in space . in their analysis , fc88 made the assumption stated above as an example , that the angular size of the nova shell is taken to be the major axis of the projected image .",
    "however , all workers do not make this identification .",
    "for example , cohen & rosenthal ( 1983 ) did use the projected semimajor axis for the angular size , but cohen ( 1985 ) used an angle - averaged radius .",
    "what way is best ?",
    "a goal of this paper is to extend the fc88 analysis to include consideration of six distinct yet plausible ways of defining the angular size of the shell .    as the number of galactic novae with well observed light curves increases , and with the much greater resolving power provided by adaptive optics and hst , it is likely that the calibration of the mmrd and @xmath0 relations will be improved , but the question of possible systematic errors in the distances becomes more important .",
    "this is especially so , if shell morphology is related to nova speed class , as has been suggested by slavin , obrien , & dunlop ( 1995 ) . likewise , as more expansion distances for individual novae become available , it is important to have clearly in mind whether and how much these distances may be in error , as the result of measuring uncertainties and modeling assumptions .",
    "theoretical arguments have been made favoring both oblate and prolate geometries for nova shells ( porter , obrien , & bode 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "empirically , it is now the consensus that , to the extent that nova shells can be described by spheroids , they are either prolate or spherical , but not oblate .",
    "fc88 discussed the few cases of resolved nova shells known at the time , in terms of whether they were elongated along one axis ( prolate spheroids ) or compressed along one axis ( oblate spheroids ) .",
    "fc88 noted that most data on the shapes of nova shells were consistent with spherical or prolate geometries , but categorized the shell of nova hr del 1967 as oblate .",
    "for this object , early models by hutchings ( 1972 ) and soderblom ( 1976 ) indeed suggested an oblate symmetry .",
    "a spatio - kinematic model by solf ( 1983 ) , however , has clearly shown that the resolved shell of hr del is consistent with a prolate geometry , and not consistent with being oblate .",
    "slavin , obrien , & dunlop ( 1995 ) carried out imaging of nova shells using narrow band filters ; in particular they have obtained images at several different tilts of an interference filter with nominal wavelength 6560   ( 17   fwhm ) , which allowed them to distinguish crudely between gas approaching or receding from the observer .",
    "their data are clearly consistent with the shells being prolate , not oblate , if they depart detectably from spherical symmetry .",
    "other spatio - kinematic studies , for example of the shell around nova dq her 1934 ( e.g. herbig & smak 1992 ) also indicate prolate symmetry",
    ". therefore we proceed with the assumption that to first approximation , nova shells are prolate spheroidal shells , with their properties in projection specified by their axis ratio and the inclination of the polar axis to the line of sight .    in section 2 of this paper , we investigate several different ways of defining the angular size of the resolved nova shell .",
    "we derive the projected size and shape of the shell and the maximum radial velocity of gas in the shell , as functions of the intrinsic axis ratio and the inclination of the polar axis .",
    "we then derive analytic expressions that give the inferred distance in terms of the true distance , as a function of axis ratio and inclination .",
    "we tabulate results for a variety of cases , using six definitions of `` angular size . '' in section 3",
    "we investigate how these various definitions of expansion distance behave , both for individual objects and when averaged over an ensemble of nova shells oriented randomly in space .",
    "we also discuss some practical matters relating to the measurement of the expansion speed and angular size of nova shells .",
    "we summarize our findings in section 4 .",
    "when viewed at an inclination angle @xmath1 , a prolate spheroid at distance @xmath2 and with principal axis ratio @xmath3 will appear projected on the sky as an ellipse with apparent axis ratio @xmath4 .",
    "we define several quantities , which appear repeatedly in the discussion to follow : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 the auxiliary quantity @xmath8 is the `` eccentricity '' of the prolate spheroid , in the sense that @xmath9 relates the major and minor axes , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , of an ellipse .",
    "we have the following relations between the axes of the spheroid in space , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the ( linear ) principal axes of the projected ellipse , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the expansion speed along the major ( polar ) axis of the spheroid . then from appendix b the maximum projected ( line - of - sight ) speed is @xmath17 where @xmath10 is the semimajor axis of the spheroid when the age of the nova remnant is @xmath18 .",
    "( constant expansion speed is assumed . ) also , a distance @xmath19 measured in the plane of the sky corresponds to an angle @xmath20 ( radians ) , where @xmath2 is the true distance of the nova .",
    "the essence of the expansion distance method is to compare an estimate of the linear size of the nova shell , @xmath21 , with an estimate of the angular size , @xmath22 .",
    "the estimator formula @xmath23 where @xmath22 is any angular radius , recovers the true distance @xmath2 in the case of a spherically symmetric expanding shell .",
    "this is because @xmath24 ( by symmetry ) and all angular radii are equal to @xmath25 where @xmath10 is the true linear size of the shell at time @xmath18 : @xmath26    for a prolate spheroid , in general @xmath27 , and there is no unique measure of the angular size @xmath22 .",
    "given independent knowledge of @xmath1 , the apparent ratio @xmath28 can be inverted to find @xmath8 . in this case equation ( 1 )",
    "can be used , with corrections to convert the measured speed @xmath29 into @xmath16 and the apparent semimajor axis @xmath30 into @xmath31 , to recover the true distance . in symbols , @xmath32    in general ,",
    "however , the inclination of the spheroid in space is not known , so the correction factors are not known , but the simple formula @xmath33 does not recover @xmath2 . furthermore , there is no reason any longer to define @xmath22 as the apparent semimajor axis  the apparent minor axis or some average indicator of the apparent size of the nova shell could be used instead .",
    "we consider six possible definitions of @xmath22 , and for each we investigate how large an error is made in estimating @xmath2 using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this question is addressed both for individual novae , with particular values of @xmath34 and @xmath1 , and for statistical ensembles of nova shells , where averages are taken over random orientations for a fixed value of @xmath34 .",
    "the six choices for @xmath22 are : @xmath35    the first two choices are the apparent major and minor axes of the projected ellipse .",
    "the third choice is the arithmetic mean of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the fourth choice is the geometric mean of these .",
    "the fifth definition , @xmath38 , is the angle - averaged apparent `` radius '' of the shell . here",
    "@xmath39 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind ( see appendix c ) .",
    "the argument @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 the sixth choice is the harmonic mean of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "corresponding to each @xmath42 is a distance estimator @xmath43 . given in table 1 are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for several combinations of true axis ratio @xmath34 and inclination @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath48 , it is not shown separately in table 1 .",
    "the probability that the polar axis of a randomly oriented spheroid makes an angle between @xmath1 and @xmath49 with the line of sight is @xmath50 .",
    "each of the estimates @xmath51 can be averaged over angle with @xmath52 as the weighting function : @xmath53 the @xmath52weighted average values of @xmath54 were computed numerically and are shown in table 1 .",
    "for example , @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "inspection of table 1 reveals several features of the various distance estimators @xmath57 .",
    "every estimator gives the correct distance for spherically symmetric nova shells , as expected .",
    "for prolate nova shells , every estimator overpredicts the distance when the polar axis is close to the line of sight , because @xmath58 does not correspond to the projected angular size . in this case , all estimators are equally poor , and increasingly so as the axis ratio @xmath34 becomes more extreme . all estimators except @xmath59 underpredict the distance for prolate nova shells when the polar axis is close to the plane of the sky . in this case",
    ", the error increases as the axis ratio decreases , but @xmath60 and @xmath61 are better than the other estimators .    finally , when considering an ensemble average of shells with random orientations , the best average distance is produced using @xmath62 , which is based on the straight mean of the projected semimajor and semiminor axes .",
    "since this is true for each intrinsic axis ratio considered separately , it will also be true for an ensemble of randomly oriented nova shells that has a mixture of axis ratios .",
    "observations of resolved nova shells show a variety of projected axis ratios .",
    "for example , nova dq her 1934 has a projected axis ratio of @xmath63 ( herbig & smak 1992 ) , while nova fh ser 1970 has @xmath64 ( slavin , obrien , & dunlop 1995 ) .",
    "nova hr del 1967 has @xmath65 according to solf ( 1983 ) .",
    "slavin et al .  ( 1995 ) find @xmath66 for hr del viewed in h@xmath67 , but a more elongated image ( same projected major axis , shorter projected minor axis ) in the light of [ ] .",
    "solf finds the intrinsic axis ratio for hr del to be @xmath68 , possibly the most extreme of the well - studied shells .",
    "thus table 1 covers most of the axis ratios observed to date .",
    "if there were a shell with @xmath69 viewed pole - on , the expansion distance method would yield an estimated distance a factor of 2.5 larger than the true distance , regardless of the specific estimator used .",
    "the median inclination of the polar axis is 60@xmath70 , and 80 per cent of all randomly oriented nova shells should have inclinations between 26@xmath70 and 84@xmath70 .",
    "thus _ typical _ individual errors in nova expansion distances will be of order tens of percent , unless the inclination and axis ratio are known .",
    "barring the tell - tale evidence of high inclination , given by an eclipsing binary system , the only way to derive the inclination of a nova shell is to construct a so - called spatio - kinematic model , in which spectra from multiple positions across the resolved shell are simultaneously modeled ( e.g. , hr del , solf 1983 ; dq her , herbig & smak 1992 , gill & obrien 2000 ) .",
    "the nova shell literature contains a mixture of techniques for measuring the expansion velocities and angular sizes .",
    "given that nova shells typically are bright enough to detect only for a few decades after outburst and hence have small angular sizes if they are resolved , this is not surprising .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that velocities and angular sizes have not always been combined in a self - consistent fashion , even in cases where the inclination and axis ratio are known .",
    "herbig & smak ( 1992 ) discuss this point at length for the case of nova dq her 1934 , comparing several different spatio - kinematic studies that arrived at widely differing distance estimates . for dq",
    "her the issue is that the shell has a finite thickness ; it is therefore possible erroneously to combine a velocity measured from the extreme outer edge with , say , a size measured from the ridge line of an image , which represents a position _ within _ the shell .",
    "martin ( 1989 ) also discusses this point . to avoid confusion , it is highly desirable for observers reporting either a line - of - sight expansion velocity or an angular size to be explicit about exactly what was measured .",
    "we suggest that angular size measurements be referred to a contour level that encloses a stated percentage of the nova shell flux .",
    "( care needs to be taken , if imaging is done through a narrow - band filter that excludes part of the shell emission . )",
    "likewise , emission line velocities may be measured at a level above the continuum such that a stated percentage of the total line flux is at less extreme velocities .",
    "if image deconvolution methods ( e.g. , the mem and clean algorithms ) are used to `` sharpen '' the image , special care needs to be taken in determining and reporting any effect this has on measurements of the `` edge '' of a nova shell , especially if the method does not conserve flux .",
    "in addition to avoiding possible ambiguities caused by the thickness of the shell , authors need to be clear about what sort of angular size is being reported .",
    "cohen & rosenthal ( 1983 ) used @xmath36 , the projected semimajor axis of the shell , and fc88 modeled the systematic errors in nova expansion distances assuming @xmath36 , as it is perhaps the easiest to measure for barely resolved shells .",
    "cohen ( 1985 ) , however , derived angular sizes by carefully modeling the appearance of a ( spherically symmetric ) shell superimposed on a central star , taking into account the point spread function of the optical system .",
    "this technique gives @xmath38 .",
    "others , e.g. , shin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , have been less careful , merely measuring the fwhm of the nova image and subtracting a stellar fwhm in quadrature to obtain a `` characteristic '' size . while this method is adequate to demonstrate angular extension of the shell , it is essentially useless for distance estimation , since it wrongly assumes that the profile of a seeing - convolved image of a shell is gaussian , and it does not take into account light from the central star .",
    "additional complications arise if the projected image of the nova shell is elongated but not strictly elliptical , or if the outline of the shell is incomplete .",
    "herbig & smak ( 1992 ) demonstrated that the `` equator '' of the dq her shell is constricted in both angular extent and velocity , and were careful to distinguish the measured equatorial velocity from the modeled minor - axis velocity of the spheroid . if there is emission from gas",
    "_ beyond _ the main elliptical outline , as reported for dq her ( slavin , obrien , & dunlop 1995 ) and rr pic ( gill & obrien 1998 ) , care must be taken that the extreme velocity used to estimate distance corresponds to the shell from which the angular size was taken , and not the extended halo .",
    "furthermore , if the spheroidal shell is incomplete , consisting only of an equatorial `` belt '' and polar `` blobs '' , then for most inclination angles , there will be no emitting gas at the internal angle @xmath71 ( see figure 2 ) that would correspond to @xmath58 in a filled shell . likewise , there may not be any gas emitting at the tangent to the line of sight , which defines the projected major axis for a complete shell ( appendix a ) .",
    "in such a case , our prescription for distance estimators formally breaks down .",
    "however , fc88 give a partial discussion of this case in the limit of a narrow equatorial belt and small polar caps , giving expressions for @xmath72 and its average for random orientations .",
    "fc88 find that individual nova distances for the `` belt and blobs '' case can be over- or underestimated , up to the same extremes as for the complete shell case , and the angle - averaged distance is underestimated by an amount very similar to the complete shell case discussed here .",
    "another complication arises from the fact that some nova shells have been observed to change their projected shape in the few years immediately after outburst .",
    "a notable case is that of nova v1974 cyg 1992 , which was observed with long - baseline interferometry at radio frequencies ( hjellming 1996 ) .",
    "the radio data suggest a model in which the outer and inner faces of the expanding shell have different ( triaxial ) ellipsoidal representations .",
    "moreover , careful models constructed to account for radio observations of novae ( hjellming et al .  1979 ; seaquist et al .  1980 ) demonstrate that the entire expanding gas cloud does not contribute equally to the optical emission line radiation , since the shell is likely more dense at the inner boundary .",
    "the emissivities of the various ions and the fraction of the expanding shell that contributes to the flux both change with time , as the nova shell expands and the post - nova central binary ( which photoionizes the shell ) recovers from the eruption .",
    "the size and morphology of a given nova shell image may differ , depending on which transition is used to image it . as discussed in section 3.1 ,",
    "hr del differs considerably in appearance , depending on whether the shell is imaged in @xmath735007 [ ] or in @xmath746548/6563/6584 h@xmath67 + [ ] .",
    "for all these reasons , it is best to measure the expansion velocity and the angular size of a shell contemporaneously if possible ; this will assure that the same parcels of gas are used for both measurements .",
    "finally , since the central star of a nova system is a cataclysmic binary , it is possible to conflate an emission line from an accretion disk or magnetically channeled accretion flow in the binary with the same line ( or a nearby one ) from gas in the nova shell . since orbital speeds of gas in the inner accretion disk",
    "may be of order @xmath75  km  s@xmath76 , there is the possibility to mis - measure the expansion velocity of the shell , unless care is taken to measure @xmath58 from a long - slit spectrum oriented along the projected major axis .",
    "( recall from appendix b that the point of the projected image at which @xmath58 is attained is generally not the same point as the central star . )",
    "these examples of traps and complications in the estimation of nova expansion distances are intended to reinforce a plea that observers give a full description of their methods and results .",
    "depending on the particular nova , the information available , and the goals of the study , one method of proceeding or another may be appropriate  perhaps there is no single way to estimate an expansion distance that is best in every instance . to allow results from different studies to be combined correctly ,",
    "the need for careful documentation is evident .",
    "we have reviewed and formalized the method of nova shell expansion distances as a means of estimating the distances to classical novae .",
    "this method combines a measurement of the shell expansion velocity ( multiplied by the time since outburst ) with some measure of the angular size .",
    "expansion distances for novae underlie the calibration of the mmrd and @xmath0 relations and also form the basis for astrophysical studies of individual novae and their remnants .",
    "it is therefore important to adopt methods of measurement that minimize any possible bias in the distances that results from incomplete information about the shape or orientation of the nova shells .",
    "many resolved shells exhibit significant prolate symmetry , so that there is no unique angular size except when the shell is seen pole - on .",
    "we developed analytic expressions for the maximum line - of - sight velocity from a complete , expanding prolate spheroidal shell and for its projected major and minor axes , as functions of the intrinsic axis ratio and the inclination of the polar axis to the line of sight . for six definitions of `` angular size '' , we then computed the error introduced by deriving a distance using the assumption of spherical symmetry ( i.e. , without correcting for inclination and axis ratio ) .",
    "the errors can be significant and possibly systematic , affecting studies of novae whether considered individually or statistically .    the definition of angular size that results in the least errors at the extremes is @xmath77 , the harmonic mean of the projected semimajor and semiminor axes .",
    "however , the definition that results in the least bias when an ensemble of randomly oriented prolate shells is considered is @xmath78 , the straight mean of the projected semimajor and semiminor axes , and we recommend this method when individual inclinations and axis ratios can not be ascertained .",
    "the @xmath78based method is always as good or better than than the @xmath36 method ( projected semimajor axis alone ) .",
    "the best individual expansion distances result from a full spatio - kinematic modeling of the nova shell , using spectroscopy of emission lines at multiple locations across the resolved shell .",
    "we have discussed practical issues and made recommendations for observers who make measurements of either the maximum line - of - sight velocity and the angular size of a resolved nova shell .",
    "the velocity measurement may be complicated by the presence of line emission from the central cataclysmic binary star , and if the spheroidal shell is not complete , the theoretical maximum velocity may not be observed at all .",
    "the correct application of angular size measurements can be compromised by convolution with the image point spread function , by improper technique , or by incomplete reporting .",
    "for best results , velocity and angular size measurements should be made contemporaneously , and must refer to the same features of the shell .",
    "observers are encouraged to report as completely as possible the measurements they have made .",
    "estimates of nova distances by the shell expansion method ( or any other method ) should be accompanied by a discussion of both random and systematic errors , including possible effects due to unaccounted - for departures from spherical symmetry , as discussed in this paper .",
