    "as is well known , the blandford - znajek(bz ) process was proposed originally as a possible energy mechanism of quasars and active galactic nuclei(agns;blandford & znajek 1977 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 , hereafter mt82 ; rees 1984 ) .",
    "recently , lee , wijers , & brown ( 2000 ) proposed that the bz process can be used as a central engine for powering gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , where the rotating energy of a stellar black hole ( bh ) with a magnetic field of @xmath5 is extracted along the magnetic field lines supported by a transient magnetized accretion disk . very recently ,",
    "lee and kim ( 2000 , 2002 ) proposed a model of the evolution of a rotating bh at the center of grbs by considering the effects of the bz process with the transient disk ( hereafter the lk model ) , and some constraints to the parameters of the bh accretion disk are given .    in this paper an analytic model of bh evolution",
    "is proposed based on the lk model and is improved in two respects : ( 1 ) a parameter @xmath2 is introduced for the position of the inner edge of the disk / torus , which is located between the innermost bound orbit and the last stable orbit .",
    "( 2 ) another parameter @xmath1 is used to indicate the ratio of the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines to that of the bh horizon .",
    "it is shown that the ratio @xmath1 being a little greater than 0.5 affects the evolutionary characteristics of the bh significantly , and the bh spin increases rather than decreases in its evolutionary process provided that the initial value of the bh spin is located in an appropriate value range determined by the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "our calculations show that the system of a bh accretion disk with @xmath3 might provide a much higher output energy in a shorter timescale for grbs than the same system with @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we derive the basic equations of bh evolution and the corresponding characteristic functions by introducing two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in ",
    " 3 and 4 we discuss the effects of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 on bh evolution and grbs by using the parameter space and the corresponding characteristic functions , respectively .",
    "finally , in  5 we discuss some problems concerning our model .",
    "geometrized units ( @xmath6 ) are used in this paper .",
    "now we are going to describe our model for the evolution of a rotating bh surrounded by a magnetized accretion disk based on the lk model .",
    "first , a parameter @xmath2 is introduced to indicate the position of the inner edge of the disk in the following equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dimensionless radial parameter corresponding to the inner - edge radius @xmath9 of the disk , which is located between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( abramowicz , jaroszynski , & sikora 1978 ; abramowicz & lasota 1980 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are dimensionless radial parameters : @xmath14 it is found from equation ( 1 ) that the inner edge of a thick disk varies continuously from the innermost bound orbit to the last stable orbit as @xmath2 changes from zero to unity , and the disk becomes a thin disk as @xmath2 attains unity .",
    "usually the evolutionary state of a kerr bh can be described by two parameters : bh mass @xmath15 and spin @xmath0 , and the latter is related to the bh mass @xmath15 and angular momentum @xmath16 by @xmath17 both @xmath18 and @xmath13 depend only on @xmath0 ( novikov & thorne 1973 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1978 ) : @xmath19 @xmath20 the specific energy @xmath21 and the specific angular momentum @xmath22 corresponding to the inner - edge radius @xmath9 of the disk / torus are expressed by ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) @xmath23 @xmath24 in the lk model , the effects of the bz process on the evolution of a rotating bh are taken into account in the environment of a transient magnetized accretion disk . due to the lack of knowledge of the remote astrophysical load in the bz process ,",
    "it is doubtful that the matching condition @xmath4 can be satisfied exactly .",
    "therefore , we introduce a parameter @xmath1 to describe the rotation of the magnetic field lines relative to the spinning bh , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines and @xmath27 is that of the horizon and is related to the horizon radius @xmath28 by @xmath29 by using a modified equivalent circuit for the bz process based on mt82 , we derive the expression for the rate of extracting energy from the rotating bh in the bz process ( hereafter the bz power ; wang , xiao , & lei 2002 ) as follows : @xmath30 @xmath31,\\ ] ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the optimal bz power corresponding to the impedance matching with @xmath4 and @xmath34 is the magnetic field on the horizon .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the parameters depending only on the bh spin .",
    "taking @xmath4 in equation ( 10 ) , we have the same expression for the optimal bz power as given by lee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who pointed out that the bz power had been underestimated by a factor of 10 in previous works .    based on the conservation of energy and angular momentum , the basic evolutionary equations of a rotating bh with disk accretion by the bz process can be written as ( park & vishniac 1988 ; moderski & sikora 1996 ; moderski , sikora , & lasota 1997 ; wang , lu , & yang 1998 ; lee & kim 2000 ) @xmath37 @xmath38 incorporating equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , we obtain the evolutionary equation of the bh spin : @xmath39    the accretion rate @xmath40 of the transient magnetized disk is related to @xmath34 by ( lee & kim 2000 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the kerr metric parameter at the inner edge . according to the lk model ,",
    "@xmath34 depends on the mass loss from the disk ( lee & kim 2000 ) : @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the initial disk mass and magnetic field , respectively .    substituting the above expression for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath8 , @xmath27 , @xmath47 and @xmath40 into equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 )",
    ", we obtain the following evolutionary equations : @xmath48 @xmath49 from equations ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , we find that @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same sign as @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and hereafter the two functions are referred to as the characteristic function of bh mass ( cfbhm ) and that of bh spin ( cfbhs ) , respectively .",
    "the characteristics of bh evolution can be well described by using the cfbhm and cfbhs , and the curves of these two functions varying with @xmath0 for a thin disk ( @xmath54 ) with different values of @xmath1 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is shown in figure 1a that @xmath55 is negative when @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath4 , 0.6 , and 0.8 , respectively . from figure 1b",
    "we find that @xmath58 is always negative for @xmath4 , while it is positive for @xmath3 with @xmath59 , and for @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "these results imply that the bh mass might decrease as the bh spin approaches unity very closely , and the bh could be spun up in the duration of powering the grb , provided that the parameter @xmath1 is a little greater than 0.5 .",
    "the effect of the variation of @xmath1 on the evolution of the bh can be discussed more visually in the parameter space consisting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the curves represented by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is found that the parameter space is divided into three regions by two thick solid curves , which are represented by @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "the former is the common boundary of regions i and ii ( curve * _ abc _ * ) , as shown in figure 2a , and the latter is the common boundary of regions i and iii , as shown in figure 2b .",
    "regions i and iii are each further divided into two sub - regions , ia and ib , and iiia and iiib , by the horizontal thin line * _ bd _ * , as shown in figures 2a and b , respectively .",
    "the segment * _ bd _ * is tangent to the curve @xmath63 at the bottom point * _ b_*(0.5610 , 0.5118 ) . in the parameter space ,",
    "each filled circle with an arrow is referred to as a representative point ( rp ) , which represents one evolutionary state of bh .",
    "we can use rp displacement in the parameter space to describe the evolution of the bh . according to the positions of rps",
    ", we have five different bh evolutionary states corresponding to five subregions , as shown in table 1 .    from table 1",
    "we find that the five evolutionary states of a rotating bh can be easily determined by rp position in the parameter space , and the details are given as follows :    \\(1 ) the rps in regions ia and ib represent the evolutionary states of the bh with increasing mass and decreasing spin , and the bh with the rp in region ia will never stop rotating , while the bh with the rp in region ib might evolve to a schwarzschild bh with zero spin in long enough time .",
    "the evolution state given in the lk model is just described by the rp in region ib .",
    "\\(2 ) the rps in region ii represent the evolutionary states of the bh towards the equilibrium spin with increasing mass and spin increasing toward equilibrium , which makes the bh a more powerful central engine for grbs .",
    "\\(3 ) the rps in regions iiia and iiib represent the evolutionary states of the bh with decreasing mass and decreasing spin , which implies that the efficiency of transferring the accreted mass into grb energy might be greater than unity in these two evolutionary states .",
    "\\(4 ) as shown in figure 2 and table 1 , there are two possible evolutionary terminals for the bh , if the evolution time is long enough .",
    "the terminal with equilibrium spin @xmath64 corresponds to the rps in regions ia , ii , and iiia , while that with zero spin corresponds to the rps in regions ib and iiib .    from the above discussion",
    ", we find that evolutionary characteristics of a rotating bh in the bz process are very sensitive to the parameter @xmath1 , especially as @xmath1 varies across the vertical ordinate of the bottom point @xmath65 in figure 2a .",
    "the value range of @xmath0 in region ii is expressed by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath64 are , respectively , the left and right intersections of the curve * _ abc _ * with a horizontal line above the segment * _ bd_*. inspecting figure 2a , we find that the more the horizontal line is above the segment * _ bd _ * or the greater @xmath1 is than @xmath68 , the greater the value range of @xmath0 is in region ii . the left part of curve * _ abc _ * is the set of @xmath67 , while the right part of curve * _ abc _ * is the set of @xmath64 .",
    "obviously , @xmath67 is unstable , while @xmath64 is stable for the evolutionary states .    in order to discuss the effects of the parameter @xmath1 on the evolution of a rotating bh and the related characteristics of grbs , we compare the results of the bh accretion disk system by taking @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "our main results are shown in figures 3 - 8 , in which the solid lines are used for the results with @xmath3 , and the dashed lines for those with @xmath4 . in our calculations ,",
    "the initial values of the concerned quantities are taken as those given in the lk model : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "\\(1 ) in figure 3 the bh spin @xmath0 increases with the evolution time if its initial value is taken to be @xmath72 for @xmath3 , while it always decreases with the evolution time no matter what initial value it takes for @xmath4 . as shown in figure 1b , 0.3114 and 0.8067 are exactly the values of @xmath67 and @xmath64 for @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "\\(2 ) in figure 4 @xmath73 can never be greater than @xmath74 no matter how much the initial disk mass is for @xmath3 , while it increases monotonically with the initial disk mass for @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath73 is defined as the critical bh spin to ensure that the bh will stop spinning after all the initial disk mass accretes onto the bh in the lk model , our result implies that a bh with its initial spin greater than @xmath67 can never be spun down to a schwarzschild bh .",
    "\\(3 ) in figure 5 the output energy @xmath75 from a system with @xmath3 ( _ solid lines _ ) is always greater than that from a system with @xmath4 ( _ dotted lines _ ) . in the former case",
    ", @xmath75 will monotonically increase with the initial disk mass @xmath45 without an upper limit , provided that the initial bh spin is greater than @xmath67 , while in the latter case , it always keeps constant for @xmath45 greater than one critical value .",
    "another difference between these two systems lies in the derivative of @xmath75 with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "as shown in table 2 the first derivative @xmath76 always increases with @xmath45 ( in units of solar mass ) provided that the system has the parameter @xmath3 with @xmath72 , while it always decreases with @xmath45 either for @xmath3 with @xmath77 or for @xmath4 with any value of @xmath78 .",
    "these results can be easily explained by the rps in the parameter space ( figure 2a ) and the relation of the bz power to the bh spin .",
    "\\(4 ) in figure 6 the output energy from the system with @xmath3 is always greater than that with @xmath4 for any initial values of the bh spin . defining the relative difference of output energy between the above two systems as @xmath79 , we have the curve of @xmath80 versus @xmath78 as shown in figure 7 , and the maximum is @xmath81 at @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the output energy for grbs can be remarkably augmented by a little increase above @xmath68 .",
    "\\(5 ) in figure 8 the evolutionary timescales @xmath83 of grbs versus @xmath78 are obtained by incorporating equations ( 16 ) @xmath84 ( 18 ) and the initial values of the systems with @xmath4 and @xmath3 , where the cutoff of @xmath83 is taken as @xmath85 defined in the lk model .",
    "a peak value of @xmath83 is found for each system , which is located at @xmath86 for @xmath3 and at @xmath87 for @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath83 of the system with @xmath3 is always less than that with @xmath4 for @xmath88 .",
    "these results might be helpful to explain grbs with the most energetic power .",
    "taking the parameter @xmath2 into account , we can discuss the evolutionary characteristics of a bh surrounded by a thick disk / torus , and the parameter spaces with boundary curves @xmath89 and @xmath90 corresponding to different values of @xmath2 are shown in figure 9 .",
    "it is found that the above five evolutionary states of a bh surrounded by a thin disk @xmath91 remain valid in the case of a thick disk / torus with its inner edge positioned by the parameter @xmath2 @xmath92 .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the bottom point of the curve @xmath89 and the leftmost point of the curve @xmath90 vary nonmonotonically with the parameter @xmath2 , and we have the curves of @xmath68 and @xmath93 versus @xmath2 as shown in figures 10 and 11 , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath68 attains its maximum of 0.598 at @xmath94 , and @xmath93 attains its minimum of 0.995 at @xmath95 .",
    "the output energy @xmath96 from the systems and the evolutionary timescales @xmath83 corresponding to the different values of @xmath2 with @xmath3 are compared in figures12 and 13 , respectively . finally , the relative differences of output energy defined by @xmath97 corresponding to the different values of @xmath2 are shown in figure 14 .",
    "the main effects of the parameter @xmath2 on bh evolution and grbs are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the bh will be spun up in the case of a thick disk @xmath98 as well as in the case of a thin disk @xmath99 , provided that we have @xmath100 with @xmath101 , where @xmath67 and @xmath64 have the same meaning as given in  3 .",
    "\\(2 ) the efficiency of transferring the accreted mass into grb energy might be greater than unity provided that the rp of bh evolutionary state is located in the corresponding region iii as shown in figure 9b .",
    "\\(3 ) from figures 12 and 13 we find that the output energy from a system with a thick disk / torus might be greater , and the concerned evolutionary timescales might be longer , than the corresponding values of a system with a thin disk if @xmath78 is greater than some value . therefore",
    ", our model with different values of @xmath2 might adapt to the grbs with different output energy and different timescales .",
    "\\(4 ) from figure 14 we find that the output energy from a system with @xmath3 is always greater than that from a system with @xmath4 , no matter what value @xmath78 has .",
    "this is true for a system with a thick disk / torus as well as for a system with a thin disk .    in summary ,",
    "compared to the effects of @xmath1 the characteristics of bh evolution and grbs are not remarkably affected by variation of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper the evolutionary characteristics of a rotating bh surrounded by a transient magnetized disk are discussed by considering the coexistence of disk accretion with the bz process , and the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 are introduced in our model to modify the lk model .",
    "a main consequence of our model is that the bh will be spun up rather than spun down provided that @xmath1 is greater than a critical value @xmath68 with @xmath101 .",
    "our calculations show that more energy from a bh system with @xmath1 above @xmath68 might be extracted in less time compared to a bh system with @xmath1 below @xmath68 .",
    "however there are still some problems related to our model .",
    "first , the different values of the ratio @xmath102 play a very important role in our model .",
    "unfortunately , the determination of this ratio has remained one of the main unresolved problems in the bz process .",
    "it was argued in a speculative way that the ratio might be regulated to about 0.5 , if the charged particles conspired with the bh to have just the right amount of inertia for the impedance matching ( mt82 ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand how the load can conspire with the bh to have the same resistance and satisfy the matching condition , since the load is so far from the bh that it can not be causally connected ( punsly & coroniti 1990 ) .",
    "it was pointed out in the theory of bh magnetospheres that @xmath26 can be regarded as a function of magnetic flux @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 , since it is constant on the magnetic surface due to isorotation and axial symmetry ( mt82 ) .",
    "very recently , beskin and kuznetsova ( 2000 ) discussed the stream equation describing magnetic surfaces @xmath105 , and found that @xmath26 can be either greater or less than @xmath106 for the different possibilities of the flow , with the electric current fixed by the pair creation region in the bh magnetosphere .",
    "however , we still have a long way to go for the determination of @xmath26 in a bh magnetosphere .",
    "second , we notice that the relation in equation(16 ) between @xmath107 and @xmath34 is the key to affecting the evolutionary characteristics . to illustrate this , we replace equation ( 16 ) with another relation between @xmath40 and @xmath34 , which was proposed based on the balance between the pressure of the magnetic field on the horizon and the ram pressure of the innermost parts of the accretion flow ( moderskin et al .",
    "1997 ) , i.e. , @xmath108 from equation ( 21 ) we assume the relation to be @xmath109 hereafter equation ( 22 ) is referred to as the msl relation . substituting the msl relation into equation ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) ,",
    "we obtain the following evolutionary equations : @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are cfbhm and cfbhs corresponding to the msl relation , respectively . in the same way",
    ", we obtain the parameter space consisting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as shown in figure 15 .",
    "the parameter space is very different from that depicted in figure 2 , and it is only divided into two regions by the boundary curve @xmath114 , corresponding to only two states of bh evolution .",
    "the characteristics of bh evolution related to the msl relation are shown in tabel 3 .    in this paper an analytic model of bh evolution",
    "is proposed for grbs .",
    "although this model is rather particular and speculative , the potential application is still attractive : a little variation of the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines might affect the output energy and evolutionary timescales of a bh system remarkably .",
    "we also hope to improve and extend this model to agns and stellar - mass bhs in future work , since there is more evidence to strongly suggest the existence of fast - spinning bhs and possibly energy extraction via blandford - znajek - like processes(krolik 2001 ) .",
    "the anonymous referees are thanked for their suggestions on the improvement of our manuscript .",
    "v. s. beskin is thanked for his encouragement and the discussion of the determination of @xmath26 in a bh magnetosphere .",
