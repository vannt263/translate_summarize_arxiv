    "at center of mass energies above @xmath0 gev , total hadronic cross sections @xmath1 show a continuous rise which persists up to the highest energies explored so far and which is consistent with a gentle powerlike growth , @xmath2 however , at asymptotically high @xmath3 , hadronic cross sections satisfy the unitarity or froissart bound , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the smallest mass in the theory .",
    "thus , the power law growth ( [ eq1 ] ) , parametrized by the soft pomeron intercept @xmath6 , can be valid only in a preasymptotic , though possibly large , kinematical regime .",
    "so far , this growth is not understood in the context of qcd . indeed ,",
    "perturbation theory in the lo bfkl framework does result in a powerlike growth @xmath7 but the bfkl intercept @xmath8 is much larger than the experimentally observed one . inspecting at large rapidity @xmath9 the analytically known dependence of the bfkl density @xmath10 of gluons of momentum @xmath11 at impact parameter @xmath12 originating from a gluon of momentum @xmath13 at initial rapidity @xmath14 , two different perturbative ( non - unitary ) growth mechanisms can be identified in the bfkl calculation :    1 .   for @xmath15 , one finds @xmath16 . for bfkl ,",
    "this is the _ dominant growth mechanism _ , resulting in ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "2 .   for @xmath17",
    ", one finds @xmath18 . for bfkl ,",
    "this is a _ subleading growth mechanism_.    here , we review arguments that including `` gluon saturation '' , i.e. parton density effects , in the lo perturbative qcd calculation allows to regulate the dominant growth in density , thus taming in comparison to bfkl the non - unitary powerlike growth to @xmath19 .",
    "this provides a perspective for a perturbative calculation of the soft pomeron intercept .",
    "for an explicit discussion of gluon saturation effects , we take recourse to a toy model of a hadronic collision . at initial rapidity @xmath14 , we consider a perturbative @xmath20-dipole with quarks at transverse positions @xmath21 and @xmath22 colliding with a hadronic target . the dipole scattering probability is @xmath23 [ we also write @xmath24 , and the total cross section is obtained by integrating over the impact parameter , @xmath25 . to calculate the rapidity dependence of the cross section , one may work in the target rest frame where @xmath26 corresponds to boosting the projectile .",
    "this boost generates additional gluons which in the large @xmath27-limit translate into additional dipoles at different transverse positions .",
    "pictorially : @xmath28 calculating the interaction of this boosted dipole wave function with the hadronic target and taking the derivative with respect to the phase space opened up by the boost , one regains the balitsky - kovchegov equation  @xcite : @xmath29 \\ , .\\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this non - linear evolution equation differs from the linear bfkl equation by the addition of the last term @xmath30 only .",
    "the physics contained in this modification of the bfkl equation is that of a _",
    "double counting correction_. namely , for a projectile consisting of two dipoles @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the scattering probability is the sum of the individual scattering probabilities minus the probability that both dipoles scatter : @xmath33 the remaining fourth term @xmath23 in ( [ eq3 ] ) is a virtual correction required by the proper normalization of the projectile wavefunction @xmath34 . in conclusion ,",
    "the bk evolution equation ( [ eq3 ] ) can be viewed in the target rest frame as bfkl evolution of the boosted projectile but supplemented by the double counting correction for the interaction of the evolved projectile wavefunction with the target .",
    "the swelling of the bk dipole projectile wavefunction in impact parameter space is thus known from bfkl .",
    "the density of dipoles of size @xmath35 at @xmath12 obtained by boosting the initial dipole of size @xmath36 to rapidity @xmath37 takes the form @xmath38\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to determine the growth of the total cross section from this density , we consider the smallest dipole for which the scattering probability @xmath39 is of order one for @xmath40 : @xmath41 if after boosting the density of dipoles at @xmath12 becomes unity , then the scattering probability is of order unity as well .",
    "this establishes the non - unitary growth  @xcite @xmath42\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq6}\\ ] ] from ( [ eq5 ] ) , one finds for the bk intercept @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "this expression is parametrically correct but numerically questionable since ( [ eq5 ] ) is based on a saddle point approximation valid for sufficiently small impact parameter only .",
    "still , the numerical value @xmath44 is compatible with a numerical result of g. salam  @xcite who finds a non - unitary growth of total cross sections with @xmath45 in a simulation which encodes essentially the same physics as ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the above derivation was given in the target rest frame where the evolution resides in the projectile wavefunction .",
    "the same result can be obtained  @xcite within weigert s formulation where the evolution is ascribed to the target .",
    "this latter argument can be viewed as establishing the non - unitary growth of the hadronic cross section for a coloured scattering probe .",
    "moreover , it was shown  @xcite that the total cross section violates unitarity for a colourless projectile as soon as it does so for a coloured one .",
    "these three arguments are independent of each other but consistent with each other and with ref .",
    "they establish that while the bk equation ensures _",
    "saturation _ of the scattering probability locally in impact parameter space ( i.e. @xmath46 for all @xmath12 ) , it violates _ unitarization _ of the total cross section  @xcite .",
    "in the target rest frame , the only density effect included in the bk equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is the nonlinear double counting correction in ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "this correction sets in as soon as the _ number _ of gluons in the projectile state becomes large , even if the gluonic _ density _ may still be small .",
    "in addition , as soon as the partonic density in the projectile reaches a critical value of order @xmath47 , one expects wavefunction saturation effects which further tame the growth of density in the projectile and are not included in ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the rapidity scales for these different effects are:@xcite @xmath48 at rapidity @xmath49 , the bfkl equation violates unitarity due to the growth in density . from ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "one finds that at rapidity @xmath50 , the bk equation violates unitarity for a ( small ) dipole of initial size @xmath36 incident on a sufficiently extended target of size @xmath51 .",
    "this violation is due to the growth of the projectile in transverse size .",
    "the applicability of the bk evolution , however , crucially depends on the nature of the target .",
    "if the target is thick enough , so that the scattering probability is parametrically larger than @xmath52 [ for a large nucleus of atomic number @xmath53 , it is @xmath54 , and if the target is wide enough , so that saturation occurs before the projectile radius swells beyond that of the target , then there is an intermediate regime @xmath55 in which bk applies .",
    "however , if the target is a nucleon , neither one of these conditions is satisfied .",
    "wavefunction saturation effects should set in when the interaction probability of a dipole of size @xmath35 with another dipole of similar size is of order unity , @xmath56 . taking the density growth exponential in rapidity , @xmath57",
    ", this indicates that saturation effects beyond those included in the bk equation become relevant for @xmath58 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that projectile wavefunction saturation effects further diminish the intercept parameter of total cross sections beyond the exponent of the bk equation .",
    "the reason is that a tamed growth of the density in the projectile due to dipole interactions will result in a tamed growth in impact parameter .",
    "this suggests the hierarchy @xmath59 thus , one is led naturally to conjecture that a non - linear generalization of the bfkl equation which goes beyond bk by taking into account wave function saturation effects ( `` pomeron loops '' ) provides a perturbative framework for the calculation of the soft pomeron intercept , @xmath60 .",
    "however , this requires that the perturbative growth mechanism occurs in the hadron on a scale smaller than the confinement scale at which the froissart bound can be expected to arise as a consequence of non - perturbative physics . as explained in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a picture of the proton as consisting of three small black discs associated with the valence quarks is consistent with what is known about hadronic cross sections and allows for this possibility .",
