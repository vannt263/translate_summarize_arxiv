    "in a high energy non - central heavy ion collision the asymmetry of the coordinate space , the overlap area , is transferred into an asymmetry in momentum space , and measured as the elliptic flow @xmath1 . the initial asymmetry in coordinate space",
    "is characterized by the eccentricity , @xmath2 where the brackets @xmath3 indicate an average over the transverse plane , using some appropriate weight . here",
    ", we use the number density of produced gluons .    in ideal hydrodynamics , assuming a short thermalization time , the final elliptic flow is proportional to the initial eccentricity @xmath4 .",
    "the proportionality constant depends on the equation of state but is roughly @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the eccentricity therefore should translate into fluctuations of the elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "recently , these @xmath6 fluctuations have been measured by the phobos and the star collaborations @xcite .    in this note , we examine the fluctuations of @xmath7 based on the monte carlo kln model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and compare to standard glauber - model results ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "in ref . @xcite we introduced a monte carlo implementation of the kharzeev - levin - nardi ( mc - kln )  @xcite approach to particle production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "gluon production is calculated individually for each configuration of nucleons in the colliding nuclei .",
    "thanks to the implementation of perturbative gluon saturation in this approach , the multiplicity can be determined via the well - known @xmath0-factorization formula  @xcite without the need to introduce infrared cutoffs ( and additional models for the soft regime ) . the saturation scale is taken to be proportional to the local density of nucleons which , in turn , is measured by counting nucleons in a given sampling area . however ,",
    "if the radius of the sampling area is @xmath8 , one overestimates the interaction probability especially in the periphery , since nucleon pairs can have a distance up to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we improved on our previous model by rejecting those pairs with @xmath10 . in the @xmath11 limit",
    "this results in an additional factor @xmath12 which is very close to the value found in refs .",
    "@xcite by accounting for the difference between the inelastic and the geometric cross section of a nucleon .",
    "we further assume here that @xmath13  mb at full rhic energy ( @xmath14  gev ) , and @xmath15  mb at lhc energy ( @xmath16  gev ) .",
    "this refined treatment allows for an excellent description of the charged multiplicity at rhic over the entire range of centralities ( for both cu and au nuclei ) , essentially down to @xmath11 collisions .",
    "[ fig : mult ] depicts our results for full rhic energy , as well as an extrapolation to pb+pb collisions at lhc energy .",
    "since there is some uncertainty regarding the evolution of the saturation scale , we show results for both fixed coupling evolution , @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and running coupling evolution of @xmath19 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for the latter case , the initial condition @xmath20 and @xmath21 was set such that at rhic energy @xmath22 agrees with previous estimates .",
    "the participant eccentricity @xmath23 , which corrects for fluctuations of the major axes and of the center of mass of the overlap region , is defined by : @xmath24 the fluctuations of this variable for a given centrality class ( here defined by the number of participants ) are determined via @xmath25        fig . [",
    "fig : fluc ] shows the result together with data from phobos @xcite and star @xcite , and a simple glauber model , where the number density of gluons scales with the number of participants @xmath26 ( note that this model fails to account for the growth of @xmath27 with centrality seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mult ] ) .",
    "these measurements are rather difficult , and therefore the error bars are quite large , as is the discrepancy between experiments , especially at high centralities where neither the glauber model , nor the cgc result can be ruled out . for semi - central collisions ,",
    "the cgc predicts somewhat lower relative fluctuations than the glauber model .",
    "we note that @xmath28 itself is quite independent of the underlying model and energy .",
    "the main reason for the lower _ relative _ eccentricity fluctuations in the mc - kln model is the larger average eccentricity for semi - central au+au collisions in this approach , see the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to check for other possible sources of fluctuations in the participant eccentricity",
    ", we implemented additional poissonian ( uncorrelated ) fluctuations of the number of gluons produced at a given point in the transverse plane .",
    "these may arise , for example , from fluctuations of the gluon evolution ladders .",
    "however , we found that they did not noticeably affect @xmath28 .",
    "one should also keep in mind that so - called non - flow effects may increase fluctuations of the measured @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , hydrodynamic fluctuations may contribute to @xmath29 as well  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath30 should be viewed only as an upper limit for @xmath31 .",
    "we have calculated the fluctuations of the initial eccentricity within a simple glauber model and for a color glass condensate approach which includes fluctuations in the positions of the hard sources ( nucleons ) .",
    "both models predict eccentricity fluctuations which nearly saturate the experimentally measured fluctuations of the elliptic flow .",
    "the cgc approach gives slightly lower _ relative _ fluctuations than the glauber model , which is largely due to a higher average eccentricity @xmath32 .",
    "their magnitude at lhc energy is similar .",
