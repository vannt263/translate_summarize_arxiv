    "these hot coronae could have been shock heated by accretion , or ejected from galaxies into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) or still detained in the galactic dark halo as cgm , depending on the feedback energy in the structure formation process .",

    "on the other hand , for our own galaxy , the presence of hot halo can explain the lack of hi signature in local dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite and the head tail structure of the high velocity clouds ( hvc)@xcite . the x - ray emission measure also puts a constraint on the baryonic content in the cgm of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "@xcite discussed that an extended hot gaseous halo profile @xcite can agree well with the existent constraints .",
    "although no broad conclusion of the extent and the profile of the cgm has been drawn , the search for the cgm has been a critical issue , and it s possible to detect the cgm through a careful design of observation considering the ubiquity of the cgm in galaxies .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite is one of the most promising methods of detecting the missing baryons .",
    "after the reionization epoch , our universe is almost completely ionized after z=6 , and free electrons are prevailing in galaxy clusters as intracluster medium ( icm ) and in between as igm .",
    "they will scatter off cmb photons via inverse compton scattering , and generate secondary cmb anisotropies known as the sz effect .",
    "the sz effect is therefore contributed by all electrons , and it can serve as a tool to probe the electrons in ionized gas and hence the missing baryons in the icm / igm / cgm . due to relatively low density and temperature of the cgm , it s difficult to detect them via the thermal sz ( tsz ) effect ( @xmath16 ) and x - ray emission ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the kinetic sz ( ksz ) effect , however , directly measures the electron momentum @xmath18 along the line of sight , and is thus less weighted toward hot gas ( icm ) in galaxy groups and clusters . for less massive halos with virial temperature around @xmath19 k ,",
    "the ksz effect turns out to be larger than the tsz effect @xcite . considering the @xmath20% fraction of missing baryons ,",
    "the prevailing igm / cgm around galaxies can become a detectable ksz effect source .",
    "blind detection of the ksz signal from the auto angular correlation alone seems impossible because of the overwhelming contamination of cosmic infrared background ( cib ) and the degeneracy between the ksz effect and the primary cmb .",
    "the state - of - art observations like the planck satellite , south pole telescope ( spt ) , and atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) alone are not able to measure the auto - correlation signal of the kinetic sz effect .",
    "most of these surveys alone can only put an upper limit of the ksz effect @xcite .",
    "taking into account the additional information of the tsz bispectrum can help improve the constraint on the ksz effect @xcite .",
    "however , the results inevitably depend on both the thermal and kinetic sz templates .",
    "since the ksz effect traces the peculiar momenta of the free electrons and thus leaves imprints in the cmb sky , it can be used to constrain cosmological models or cosmological parameters .",
    "recent works have devoted to measuring the ksz effect on the cmb sky at the positions of galaxy clusters or galaxies .",
    "works have focused on measuring the bulk flow of the local universe using galaxy clusters @xcite , however , the existence of the bulk flow remained controversial due to low significance @xcite .",
    "the first solid detection of the ksz effect @xcite reported a 3.8 @xmath7 significance by measuring the pairwise ksz effect of galaxy clusters , taking advantage of the synergy between the boss spectroscopic galaxy group catalogue and the act survey .",
    "alternatively , the ksz effect was proposed to probe the missing baryons @xcite .",
    "progress has been made towards the measurement of the ksz effect using galaxies .",
    "@xcite claimed the detection of the local bulk flow by measuring the ksz effect toward the direction of nearby galaxies , which indicates the existence of hot plasma around galaxies .",
    "moreover , recent works @xcite found the evidence of ksz signature out to about three times the mean virial radius of the central galaxy catalogue ( cgc ) sample , in which they employed both the pairwise momentum estimator and the ksz temperature - velocity field correlation estimator .",
    "these results suggest that the hot plasma around galaxies may be responsible for the missing baryons of galaxies , and produce detectable ksz effect .    considering",
    "the cgm may account for a significant fraction of the missing baryons of galaxies , we here present a work to probe the prevailing cgm through the measurement of the kinetic sz effect at the galaxy positions in the cmb map .",
    "previous work by @xcite has theoretically studied the tsz / ksz effect of the cgm , and discussed the detectability of the sz effect of the cgm as well as the constraints on the gas fraction .",
    "we here alternatively propose to measure the ksz effect of the cgm and the detectability of the signal with different profiles .",
    "we try to design an unbiased minimum variance estimator of the ksz effect of the cgm in order to minimize the noise , and then stack the velocity weighted ksz signal of galaxies to further improve the measurement .",
    "the minimum variance estimator involves finding out an optimal filter to filter out the large scale contamination of the primary cmb while keep the ksz signal of cgm conserved .",
    "the design is unprejudicedly constructed for both the icm in galaxy groups and the cgm around galaxies , provided we have the knowledge of the profile of the optical depth profile of the icm / cgm ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * for the application to mock sample of clusters ) . _ in particular , we here focus on the ksz effect of the cgm of milky way(mw)-size halos . _",

    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "when cmb photons travel along the line of sight , the high energy electrons in the intervening medium ( e.g. icm , igm or cgm ) will scatter off the cmb photons and distort the energy spectrum of the cmb via the inverse compton scattering .",
    "this process gives rise to the tsz effect due to the thermal motion of electrons , and to the ksz effect if the scattering medium has a bulk motion with respect to the rest frame of the cmb .",
    "for the cgm of a milky way - size galaxy , the ksz effect is larger than the tsz effect @xcite .",
    "suppose we have a galaxy with its centre at the position @xmath25 in the 2d sky , where we have adopted the flat sky approximation as the galaxy s scale is very small @xcite .",
    "the peculiar momenta of the electrons in the surrounding cgm will induce the kinetic sz effect @xmath26 . in this work",
    ", we assume the ksz signal of the cgm is spherical symmetry around the galaxy centre , and we can always put the galaxy centre @xmath27 at the origin , therefore from herein we write any function of @xmath28 as a function of the radial separation @xmath29 .",
    "the induced ksz signal is proportional to the electron momentum integrated along the line of sight @xmath30 @xmath31 is the optical depth profile of the cgm , where @xmath32 is the scale factor , @xmath33 is the comoving radial distance , @xmath34 is the electron number density profile , and @xmath35 is the thompson cross section .",
    "since for a single galaxy , the peculiar velocity along the line of sight @xmath36 is nearly constant , the ksz induced temperature distortion is proportional to the product of the optical depth and the line of sight velocity @xmath37 here , we have defined @xmath38 as @xmath39 .",
    "the observed optical depth profile is the convolution @xmath40 between the underlying profile @xmath41 and the beam window @xmath42 .",
    "we assume the beam of the sz survey is a gaussian profile @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the beam profile .",
    "accordingly , the beam window in fourier space can be written as @xmath46 . in practice , we calculate the smoothed optical depth profile in fourier space as @xmath47 .",
    "the mass fraction and the underlying spatial distribution of the cgm are still under debate .",
    "self - regulated galaxy simulations @xcite indicate that the baryonic fraction of galaxies can vary substantially .",
    "a reasonable range covers 30 - 100% of the cosmic mean @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "observations have made little advance in constraining the mass fraction of the cgm , which covers an even broader range of the mass fraction @xmath8 10 - 100% @xcite .",
    "the profile of the cgm is also an open question , and the empirical @xmath0 profile is often adopted in the analysis of the observational data , especially for elliptical and massive spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that the mb profile @xcite can account for the missing baryons of the milky way , and is favoured by current observational constraints . in this work , we take the mb profile as a fiducial profile of the cgm for mw - size spiral galaxies , and the @xmath0 model as a comparison profile .",
    "we calculate the ksz effect in the context of future galaxy surveys such as ska .",
    "such survey will detected a huge number of hi field galaxies and is less subject to the contamination of the hot icm .",
    "we expect that most galaxies will be located in halos with mass range @xmath49@xmath50 , and assume that gas within the virial radius is in the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "given the redshift distribution and mass distribution of the surveyed galaxies , we can in principle calculate the differential contribution of host halos in certain mass and redshift bin , and obtain the total stacked signal .",
    "though , we will take the example of the typical milky way - size halo of @xmath51 m@xmath52 in this work .",

    "we assume the missing mass of hot gas is @xmath64 as in their work , which implies @xmath65 of the cosmic mean .    for comparison",
    ", besides the fiducial profile , we also test the detectability of a steeper density profile , the @xmath0 profile , which follows @xmath66 the @xmath0 profile usually fits well to the hot gas around elliptical galaxies @xcite and galaxy groups and clusters@xcite .",
    "a realistic @xmath0 profile would require fitting two parameters , the core radius @xmath67 and the profile index @xmath0 , to the x - ray emission data .",
    "we here assume the index @xmath68 , and fix @xmath69 for a direct comparison between the mb profile and the @xmath0 profile .",
    "we also require a density normalization that integrated gas mass within the virial radius to be @xmath70 .",

    "we here choose the @xmath0 profile to demonstrate the detectability of the cgm , which may put constraints on its upper limit .",

    "it can be marginally resolved by the act - like sz survey . at higher",
    "redshift , the galaxies are not resolved or just marginally resolved so that most of the signal is within the beam and concentrated in the central pixel regardless of spatial profile .",
    "thus a similar optical depth profile for different cgm profiles is expected after the beam convolution at higher redshifts .",
    "below redshift @xmath83 , the galaxy can be well resolved into several concentric rings of pixels .",

    "the ksz effect is immersed in the overwhelming contamination constituted by the thermal sz effect @xmath85 , the primary cmb fluctuation @xmath86 , the foreground cosmic infrared background @xmath87 @xcite , and the instrument noise @xmath88 imposed by the detector .",
    "the noisy temperature distortion profile @xmath89 of the cgm at galaxy position is given by @xmath90 where we have contracted @xmath91 as a term @xmath92 , as they are all noise to the ksz effect .",
    "in realistic surveys , the sky map is pixelated on the receiver . for each pixel in the observed cmb map ,",
    "both sky and the instrument noise contribute to the measured temperature .",

    "the problem of probing the ksz effect of the cgm is now equivalent to the problem of optimally solving for @xmath99 in eq .",
    "[ eq : noisy_map ] .",
    "the basic idea is outlined as follows .",
    "the problem requires separating the ksz signal from the noisy cmb map by constructing a correlation , and then beating the noise from all the other components , mainly from the primary cmb .",
    "as shown in previous works , the ksz effect of the cgm is correlated with an effective velocity field @xmath100 , which we can reconstruct from spectroscopic galaxy surveys . the correlation is only contributed by ksz effect , but the noise term is contributed by all the components in the cmb sky plus the instrument noise .",
    "we can then optimally remove the noise with the matched filter .",
    "this would require the knowledge of the optical profile of the underlying ksz signal of the cgm .",
    "finally we stack galaxies of the same host halo mass to boost the signal to noise @xmath101 .",
    "the presence of the overwhelming noise , e.g. the primary cmb , the cib from dusty star forming galaxies , the tsz from the very source of ksz effect , and the potential correlation between the cib and the tsz , makes the direct detection of the ksz effect nearly impossible . in principle , one can separate the signal if there are different spectral dependences between different components of the noise term , by taking advantage of modern cmb surveys with multiple bands . however , the ksz effect itself is not only much smaller than other components , but is also degenerate with the primary cmb , as it lacks spectral dependence .    the local velocity or momentum is a good tracer of the underlying ksz effect .",
    "we can therefore weight the temperature distortion profile @xmath102 around galaxies with an effective velocity @xmath103 at the galaxy position .",
    "galaxy density @xmath104 traces the underlying dark matter distribution @xmath105 within an accuracy of a bias factor , i.e. @xmath106 . with the aid of spectroscopic galaxy survey",
    ", we can reconstruct an effective velocity field @xmath103 that traces the underlying peculiar velocity @xmath107 , by assuming that the matter density @xmath105 follows the linear growth theory .",
    "such approximation was widely adopted , and the reconstructed velocity traces the underlying velocity well ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more discussion ) .",
    "given the galaxy distribution , we can construct the underlying dark matter density field @xmath105 , which should follow the continuity equation of dark matter in the linear approximation @xmath108 where @xmath107 is the underlying peculiar velocity . in the regime of the linear perturbation theory",
    ", one can reconstruct the effective velocity field @xmath103 with @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the linear density growth rate .",
    "we have employed that the density follows the linear perturbation theory , and the galaxy is linearly biased against the dark matter with @xmath106 , where @xmath114 is the linear bias of galaxies . from galaxy surveys , we can measure the galaxy bias @xmath114 beforehand .",
    "though there are stochasticities in galaxy bias , studies have shown that the uncertainty in galaxy bias is likely to be at the level of 10% @xcite , and can be negligible at the scales of interest @xcite .",
    "this construction cancels out the cross correlation between the velocity and all the other components except the ksz effect , since they do nt have the characteristic directional dependences and should be uncorrelated with the reconstructed velocity .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are able to isolate the ksz signal of the cgm . statistically , the line of sight component of the recovered velocity @xmath115 is correlated with underlying velocity field @xmath36 , and is thus correlated with the ksz effect @xmath116 ( momentums ) . so that we obtain the correlation of the recovered velocity and the cmb map @xmath117   \\right > \\\\      & = \\langle v_{\\parallel } t_{\\rm ksz}(\\theta ) \\rangle \\\\      & = \\langle v_{\\parallel } \\tilde{u } \\rangle   \\tau_b ( \\theta ) . \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the second line of the equation , we have dropped out @xmath118 .",

    "we also made an assumption that @xmath115 and @xmath102 follow the distribution of gaussian fields .",
    "we then expand the equation using wick theorem , and omit any terms concerning 3-point correlation .",
    "the measurement error is constituted by the product of the velocity dispersion @xmath124 and the temperature variance @xmath125 of each pixel in the cmb survey .",
    "it s clear from eq .",
    "[ eq : stacking_var_nofilter ] that the temperature variance of each pixel is contributed by all the components in the pixel , including the predominant cmb variance .",
    "therefore , cross correlating the cmb map with the reconstructed velocity @xmath115 merely separates the ksz effect of cgm from other components of the noisy cmb map , while the detection is still subject to large measurement error .",
    "as shown later in  [ subsec : signal_to_noise_nofilter ] , stacking @xmath8 1 million mw - size halos is necessary to achieve 1 @xmath7 detection .",
    "thus a direct cross correlation between the ksz effect of the cgm with the reconstructed velocity picks out only the ksz effect . to improve the detection ,",
    "we need to further reduce the measurement error by removing the contamination of all the other components .",
    "this involves utilizing the knowledge of the covariance matrix of the noise , and the spatial distribution of the ksz signal of the cgm , which in turn lies in the optical depth profile @xmath119 as in eq .",
    "[ eq : stacking_corr ] . given the profile of @xmath80",

    "the peak contribution to the velocity correlation is from around @xmath234@xmath179mpc@xmath180 , and 70% contribution is from @xmath235@xmath179mpc@xmath180 . given a galaxy survey with number density larger than @xmath236mpc@xmath2 , the recovered velocity traces the underlying velocity very well on scales of interest , as shown in fig .",

    "this catalogue alternatively provide a measure of the velocity field .",
    "however , the spiral galaxy number ( @xmath8 150 ) covering the act sky ( 780 deg@xmath152 released in the southern sky ) is so small that the cgm of these galaxies may not be detectable . with even smaller beam size and data release of full 2500 @xmath237 sky in the future",

    "for example , the cgm in massive early type galaxies , even with low baryon fraction , can contain more hot gas than in late type galaxies @xcite .",
    "if this is the prevailing case , early type galaxies should contribute a huge reservoir of cgm for the ksz effect .",
    "6df galaxy redshift survey ( 6dfgrs ) @xcite has measured the peculiar velocity of @xmath8 9000 early type galaxies at @xmath238 in the southern sky .",
    "a very rough estimate shows that there are @xmath8 300 galaxies in the area covering the act sky .",
    "given the @xmath0 profile , as a usually adopted profile for the cgm in elliptical galaxies , the cgm in the halo with mass of @xmath51 m@xmath52 ( as shown in fig .",
