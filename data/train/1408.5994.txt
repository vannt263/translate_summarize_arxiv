    "when the individual members of a group of oscillators assumed to be unrelated to each other are coupled separately to a common radiation field that is coherent , the field will drive these oscillators to radiate in a coherent fashion , resulting in an amplification of stimulated radiation . if this group of oscillators is treated as a single unit , interesting collective aspects such as superradiance will emerge @xcite , even if the field is not coherent .",

    "<S> we study a series of @xmath0 oscillators each coupled to its nearest neighbours , and linearly to a phonon field through the oscillator s number operator . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the hamiltonian of a pair of adjacent oscillators , or a dimer , within the series of oscillators can be transformed to a form in which they are collectively coupled to the phonon field as a composite unit . in the weak coupling and rotating - wave approximation </S>",
    "<S> , the system behaves effectively like the trilinear boson model in the one excitation subspace of the dimer subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced dynamics of the one excitation subspace of the dimer subsystem coupled weakly to a phonon bath is similar to that of a two - level system , with a metastable state against the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the decay constant of the subsystem is proportional to the dephasing rate of the individual oscillator in a phonon bath , attenuated by a factor that depends on site asymmetry , intersite coupling and the resonance frequency between the transformed oscillator modes , or excitons . as a result of the collective effect , </S>",
    "<S> the excitation relaxation lifetime is prolonged over the dephasing lifetime of an individual oscillator coupled to the same bath . </S>"
