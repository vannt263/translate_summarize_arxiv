    "we note that linear least - squares fitting with @xmath63 clipping produced similar results .",
    "the 4321 cmr was less straightforward to fit than the 4304 cmr . restricting the inital sample to @xmath62 , @xmath64 , or within @xmath65 mag of the 4304 cmr all",
    "lead to different cmr slopes and scatters .",
    "the incompleteness of our spectroscopic sample for this field hampers our ability to accurately measure the 4321 cmr . in the end we chose to perform an initial clip around the 4304 cmr ,",
    "then used an iterative linear fit with @xmath66 clipping based on bisquare weighting .",
    "however we discuss cmr results obtained from other initial clipping choices .",
    "uncertainties in the slopes , zeropoints , and scatters were derived with 10,000 bootstrap simulations . to estimate the intrinsic scatter about the fitted cmr we subtracted , in quadrature , the average galaxy color error from the measured scatter .",
    "we also determined the mean scatter required to make the reduced @xmath67 of the linear fit equal to 1 .",
    "this method yielded intrinsic scatters lower by @xmath68  % , and are the values we quote .",
    "the scatter about the cmr can be used to constrain the formation epoch of the cmr galaxies . using a simple model that assumes that the difference in age is relatively constant as a function of magnitude ( galaxy mass )",
    ", the intrinsic scatter can be modeled in three ways . following the method first used by @xcite",
    ", the first method assumes galaxies form in single bursts at random times between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . as we increase @xmath70 , the mean age of the 10000 model galaxies increases , and the distribution of galaxy ages",
    "also narrows .",
    "we assume a minimum @xmath70 of 0.5  gyr .",
    "galaxies need at least @xmath71  gyr after ceasing star formation to redden and arrive on the red cluster sequence .",
    "these models assume no correlation in galaxy formation times within a cluster halo .",
    "the relationship between intrinsic scatter , luminosity - weighted mean galaxy age , and @xmath70 is shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] for models with a salpeter imf and three metallicities ( z=0.008 , 0.02 , 0.05 ; bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "another method assumes galaxies form stars at constant rates from random times @xmath72 and @xmath73 between @xmath74 and @xmath70 .",
    "again we vary @xmath70 from 0.5  gyr from the time of observation to @xmath74 .",
    "a third method is to assume exponentially declining star formation rates , starting and ending at random times @xmath72 and @xmath73 between @xmath74 and @xmath70 .",
    "previous studies have found that the ages derived from this constant star formation model are systematically lower by @xmath75% @xcite .",
    "this is approximately what we find here for intrinsic scatters of @xmath76  mag .",
    "however the largest changes in mean ages would be from metallicities lower than solar , according to the bruzual & charlot 2003 models . as is known from high - resolution spectroscopy in the local universe , massive elliptical galaxies have solar or super - solar metallicities , although it is not clear how smoothly the metallicity varies with luminosity along the red sequence .",
    "these models would predict a decreasing scatter with luminosity if the mean ages did not depend on luminosity .    in the following sections we quote constraints on galaxy ages and formation times from only the single burst method with solar metallicity .",
    "errors on the ages and formation redshifts come from adding and subtracting the bootstrapped @xmath77 errors to the intrinsic scatter to derive the asymmetric @xmath77 limits on the average ages and formation redshifts .",
    "we compare our fitted cmr relations to the relation for coma from @xcite .",
    "we transformed the @xmath78 slope and zeropoint to @xmath79 using the bc03 solar and super - solar 12 - 13  gyr ssp models . from this we derived the relation : @xmath80 . using the empirical kinney - calzetti elliptical , s0 , and sa templates @xcite and the coleman elliptical template @xcite gave a similar result .",
    "we transformed the @xmath79 slope , @xmath81 , to the @xmath3 slope of @xmath82 at @xmath44 with the derived relation @xmath83 .",
    "this transformation depends somewhat on the templates used to derive the colors . with the empirical templates we derived the relations @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we convert the observed @xmath3 colors measured in ab magnitudes to rest - frame u - b measured in vega magnitudes using the iraf synphot package and the bc2003 z=0.008 , 0.02 , 0.05 metallicity models with single bursts and ages between @xmath86  gyr .",
    "we performed a linear fit to these models and find @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "the color difference in @xmath3 between a redshift of @xmath44 and a redshift of @xmath89 depends strongly on the underlying galaxy sed , if one considers the full range of galaxy types .",
    "for example , a galaxy matching a @xmath90 s0 template spectrum would be 0.0041 mag redder at @xmath89 , while an sa template spectrum would be 0.0130 mag redder , but an sb template would be 0.006 mag bluer .",
    "the @xmath3 colors of the cmr galaxies fall between the sa ( @xmath91 at @xmath44 ) and sb ( @xmath92 at @xmath44 ) empirical templates , but the shape of the sed is not likely to match . instead we use the @xcite single bursts and short exponentially declining sfr models and we find corrections of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "the range in redshift for each cluster is @xmath94 , or maximum corrections of 0.008 in ( @xmath3 ) color .",
    "these corrections are small enough that we neglect them .      the color - magnitude diagram of cl1604 +",
    "4304 is shown in figure  [ cmd]a .",
    "the red cluster sequence is prominent in the color - magnitude diagram of this cluster field .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table  [ tab : cmr4304 ] . for the e+s0 sample",
    "we find    @xmath95    and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath96 mag .",
    "the slopes , zeropoints , and scatters of the e+s0+sa , e+s0 , e , and s0 relations are consistent within the errors .    in figure  [ cmr ]",

    "[ cmd ] ) , the red cluster sequence appears less defined , and it lacks bright , @xmath99 magnitude elliptical galaxies . the cmr fitting results are summarized in table  [ tab : cmr4321 ] . using an inital clip of @xmath100 mag around the 4304 cmr",

    "again for this cluster , the slopes , zeropoints , and scatters of the e - only and s0-only relations are the same within @xmath77 errors .    for the e+s0 intrinsic scatter , with the single burst models we find an average age of @xmath105  gyr , and @xmath106 . for the elliptical - only sample of 19 galaxies",

    "for example , using @xmath62 and @xmath66 clipping , the e+s0 sample the slope and intrinsic scatter are @xmath109 and @xmath110 . shown in fig .  [ 4321_ccuts ] , this cmr includes elliptical galaxies redward of the coma slope , and s0s with @xmath111 .",
    "some or all of these galaxies may be interlopers",
    ". on the other hand , they may be cluster members which have yet to evolve to a tight cmr , and we are biasing the cmr slope and underestimating the intrinsic scatter with our initial cut about the 4304 cmr .",
    "the e - only cmr slope and intrinsic scatter are @xmath112 and @xmath113 , still significantly flatter and with more scatter than the e - only slope initially clipped around the 4304 cmr .",
    "if we try to cut based on distance to reduce contamination by non - cluster members , we still find flatter slopes .",
    "if we define the center of the cluster as the location of the brightest elliptical ( 16:04:33.61 , + 43:21:04.0 , j2000 ) and fit the e+s0 cmr within @xmath114 , we find a slope and intrinsic scatter of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "the initial color and magnitude cuts have a large impact on the derived cmr .",
    "we can combine the galaxy samples because of the small redshift difference between the clusters .",
    "the difference in @xmath3 color between an early - type galaxy at @xmath44 and @xmath89 is small enough to be negligible ( 0.0008 ab mag for bc03 tau models ) .",

    "fainter than @xmath129 we note that the spectroscopic members tend to be bluer than the cmr , likely due to the combination of color and @xmath130band selection .",
    "there are only three s0/a galaxies in the fit , and they are all fainter than @xmath131 .",
    "the cmr appears to be populated fairly evenly by e and s0 galaxies in magnitude ; no significant segregation is seen . as for the individual clusters , the measured cmr slope , zeropoint , and scatter for the e - only and s0-only combined populations are consistent within the errors .",
    "in this section we compare the slopes , zeropoints , and scatters of the cl1604 + 4304 and 4321 cmr relations .",
    "as stated in the previous section , we can directly compare the cmrs because of the small redshift difference between the clusters .",
    "for the e+s0 sample , we find slopes consistent at the @xmath132 level ( @xmath133 vs. @xmath134 ) , with the formally steeper slope belonging to cl1604 + 4304 . as discussed in   3.3 , the 4321 cmr is less defined and more problematic to fit . a difference in cmr slopes is not ruled out , given the incompleteness of the spectroscopic samples . for the elliptical galaxies only , the slopes are in agreement : -0.074@xmath1350.012 vs. -0.066@xmath1350.027 ) , as are the s0-only slopes ( @xmath136 vs. @xmath137 )",
    ".    the slope of the cmr can be used as a diagnostic of the average age of the galaxies @xcite . within 4  gyr of formation ,",
    "more metal - rich galaxies become redder faster than more metal - poor ones , and an initally flatter slope becomes steeper .",
    "thus , if the cmr galaxies formed independently of mass ( magnitude ) , within 4  gyr of formation , the slope should be flatter than its @xmath90 value , because the brighter galaxies are bluer with respect to their final colors than the less luminous galaxies .    to get an idea of the range of slopes one would expect at this redshift , in figure  [ 16h_kodama ]",
    "we show the 4304 cmr with our fitted cmr relation as a solid line , the 4321 relation as a dash - dot line , and three models from kodama & arimoto @xcite with formation redshifts of @xmath138 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "the model cmr relations are summarized in table  [ tab : kodama ] .",
    "the slopes become steeper as the formation redshift increases , mostly from the bright end of the cmr becoming redder .",
    "all three model slopes are too flat to match the faint end of the 4304 cmr relation , but the @xmath138 model matches the cmr relation of 4321 . if the zeropoint of 4321 were not redder than 4304 , then we would interpret the marginally flatter slope as a consequence of a larger formation redshift for 4321 . basically , the slope for 4321 is flatter because the galaxies are redder at a given magnitude , which is inconsistent with younger ages .",
    "the zeropoints of the e+s0 and e - only relations are significantly different between 4304 and 4321 ( @xmath139 ) . the cl1604 + 4304 zeropoint is bluer in both cases , by about @xmath140 magnitudes .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ 16h_kodama ] .",
    "this is caused by faint galaxies in cl1604 + 4321 that are redder than the faint galaxies in cl1604 + 4304 ( @xmath141 vs. @xmath142 ) .",
    "if they are cluster members , this would imply they are either older or more metal - rich than galaxies of corresponding brightness in cl1604 + 4304 .",
    "given cl1604 + 4321 s lower mass and lack of bright ellipticals , it would be surprising if the low - mass end of the cmr contains older or more metal - rich elliptical galaxies .",
    "we think it more likely that the low mass end of the cl1604 + 4321 is not yet or only partially formed , and the faint , red , elliptical galaxies are interlopers , pushing the zeropoint redder , and the slope flatter .",
    "more extensive spectroscopy of the cl1604 supercluster region indicates that there is a background structure at @xmath143 in the cl1604 + 4321 field ( r. gal , private communication ) .",
    "the intrinsic scatters for all samples are not significantly different between the two clusters , implying similar ages and formation redshifts .",
    "this is the result we derive if we initially clip the 4321 sample around the 4304 cmr .",
    "if we instead use a similar color cut and @xmath66 clipping , then 4321 , the lower mass cluster , has a much larger scatter , corresponding to an average age difference of @xmath144  gyr between 4304 and 4321 , for both the e+s0 and elliptical - only populations .",
    "with all the evidence that less massive galaxies form their stars at later times than more massive galaxies , the downsizing concept @xcite , assuming a constant scatter about the cmr as a function of magnitude may not be correct .",
    "if the downsizing phenomenon also occurs for cmr galaxies , then not only should the average color become bluer with magnitude ( decreasing mass ) , but the range in colors should also increase , increasing the measured scatter with magnitude .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the cmr on galaxy luminosity ( mass ) by first fitting the cmr in restricted magnitude ranges , then fixing the cmr slope and zeropoint from the fit to the bright end and calculating the intrinsic scatter about this relation .",
    "there are too few galaxies in the cl1604 + 4321 sample for meaningful measurements , so we focus on cl1604 + 4304 and the combined sample . for cl1604 + 4304 , the intrinsic scatter about the cmr for galaxies with @xmath145 ( bright end ; @xmath146 to @xmath147 ) is @xmath148 magnitudes , and @xmath149 mag for the range @xmath150 ( faint end ; @xmath151 to @xmath152 ) , a @xmath153 difference .",

    "the elliptical - only scatter also increases with magnitude , from @xmath36 mag to @xmath162 .",
    "these differences in scatter are significant at the @xmath163 level .    for the combined cluster population ,",
    "we fix the slope at @xmath164 and zeropoint at 1.754 , as we found for the combined e+s0 population , and measure the scatter at the bright and faint end about this relation . for the e+s0 population ,",
    "we find intrinsic scatters of @xmath165 mag at the bright end , and @xmath166 mag at the faint end , a @xmath167 result .",
    "for the elliptical - only population fixing the slope and zeropoint at -0.070 and 1.759 , we find @xmath157 mag at the bright end , and @xmath168 mag at the faint end , a @xmath169 result .",
    "summarizing these results , with both methods , 1 ) an independent fitting of the slope , zeropoint , and scatter of the cmr at bright and faint ends , and 2 ) fixing the slope and the zeropoint from the full fit and compute the scatter about this relation for the bright and the faint ends , we detect marginally significant ( @xmath153 ) increases in scatter with magnitude in the e+s0 and elliptical populations . the difference in scatter amounts to an age difference of @xmath170  gyr with the solar metallicity single burst models .",
    "similar results have been previously reported .",
    "@xcite found increasing scatter about the cmr found in groups at @xmath171 , although they did not find evidence for this in their observed cluster , rxj0152.7 - 1357 , which we speculate is due to large photometric errors relative to acs .",
    "a dependence of cmr scatter on cmr galaxy properties has been found in the studies of ms  1054 - 03 by @xcite and @xcite . restricting the sample to early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath172 magnitude and excluding merger candidates , the rest - frame @xmath79 scatter is @xmath173 mag .",
    "but including merger candidates and all early - types down to @xmath174 magnitudes , they found an intrinsic scatter of @xmath175 mag .",
    "an increase of scatter and steepening of the slope compared to @xmath90 would be expected if fainter galaxies are on average younger . if all cmr galaxies formed at the same time , but with metallicity varying with mass , there should be no increase in scatter , or possibly a decrease in scatter .",
    "an increase in scatter at faint magnitudes is expected if lower mass galaxies form their stars at later times , and the expected offset from the cmr of the higher mass galaxies should be bluewards .",
    "cl1604 + 4304 and 4321 are at the low - mass end of previously studied clusters at @xmath176 , so the comparison of the early - type cmr to other high redshift clusters should give us important information about the variation in formation times of cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "a significant uncertainty in comparing the cmr slopes between clusters is in the transformation from the observed slope to rest - frame @xmath177 , as this is dependent on the spectral templates used for the transformation . for consistency with our comparison sample ,",
    "we use the same templates used for the cl1604 slope and scatter transformation ( see  3 ) to transform the observed cmr slopes for the elliptical - only samples for ms  1054 and cl  0152 - 1357 @xcite , cl0910 + 5442 @xcite , cl1252 - 2927 @xcite , and lynx e+w @xcite .",
    "we list the slopes and the transformations in table  [ tab : slopes ] .",
    "we note that the quoted slope measurements are made over different absolute magnitude ranges , which may lead to different derived cmr slopes .",
    "another complication is in the filter transformations , i.e. how well is the underlying galaxy spectral energy distribution matched by the templates used to derive these transformations .",
    "the three clusters at @xmath1 , ms  1054 - 03 , rx  j0152.7 - 1357 , and cl1604 , span a large range of slopes , and it is unclear if this is significant . the ms  1054 and rx  j0152.7 - 1357 slopes were fitted with a magnitude limit about 1 magnitude fainter than cl1604 , and were fitted using _ only _ spectroscopically confirmed cluster members . if we fit the cl1604 elliptical - only sample at the same limiting magnitude , we find a much shallower cmr slope ( @xmath178 ) that is in agreement with both rx  j0152.7 - 1357 and ms  1054 - 03 . for cl1604 ,",
    "the fitted cmr slope at the bright end is consistent with other clusters at intermediate redshift @xcite , but the galaxies at the faint end are relatively bluer , pushing the composite slope steeper .",
    "the only cluster with a comparably steep slope is lynx  w , however , only 6 galaxies contribute to this slope .",
    "trends of cmr slope with cluster mass and x - ray properties will be discussed in mei et al .",
    "( 2006c ) .",
    "the average formation redshifts of early - type galaxies derived here , @xmath5 , agree well with those from previous cluster studies : @xmath179 at @xmath171 @xcite , @xmath180 at @xmath181 @xcite , and @xmath182 at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we measured the scatter about the cmr in restricted magnitude ranges , and find that scatter increases as a function of magnitude .",
    "@xcite studied 12 clusters at @xmath183 covering a factor of 100 in x - ray luminosity , and put an upper limit of 2  gyr on the average variation in cmr galaxy ages from the lack of observed dependence of cmr zeropoint on x - ray luminosity .",
    "our results are not inconsistent with this , as an age range of 2  gyr is quite large , much larger than the range of @xmath184  gyr that we probe here .",
    "they also noted that the 5 least x - ray luminous clusters ( @xmath185erg  s@xmath21 ) had sparse cmrs , forcing them to combine clusters to measure a composite faint x - ray cluster cmr .",
    "we find a similar qualitative difference in the color - magnitude diagrams and cmrs of cl1604 + 4304 and 4321 .",
    "there is a lack of bright , @xmath186 elliptical galaxies in 4321 , possibly because mass assembly / bcg formation in 4321 is incomplete .",
    "the cmr scatters and slopes of the @xmath14 lynx e and w clusters were found to depend on distance from the cluster center @xcite , increasing and steepening as the distance increased .",
    "we find no such dependence for either cluster sample , but the number of galaxies is small and the radial coverage is slightly less than 1  mpc .",
    "we also find no difference in the cmr relations for the e and s0 galaxies separately .",
    "so far , only one study has found a difference in the e and s0 cluster populations at @xmath176 .",
    "@xcite found that the cmr for s0s in cl0910 ( @xmath181 , l@xmath187  erg  s@xmath21 ; stanford et  al .",
    "2002b ) had a significantly bluer zeropoint than for the ellipticals , implying younger ages or lower metallicities at similar luminosity .",
    "the intrinsic scatter for the combined cluster sample agrees well with other clusters at similar redshifts , confirming a lack of measured evolution of scatter about the cmr down to low cluster x - ray luminosities .",
    "this lack of evolution in the measured scatter could be due to a combination of progenitor bias @xcite and the fitting technique .",
    "we found that the intrinsic scatter increases as a function of magnitude , and is significantly larger for cmr galaxies from @xmath188l@xmath7 in our combined cluster sample .",
    "the combination of galaxies within @xmath189  l@xmath7 having similar properties over a range of environment , and fewer cmr galaxies with l@xmath190l@xmath7 present at @xmath176 ( e.g. de  lucia et  al . 2004 ) could conspire to keep the measured scatters constant . as also discussed in @xcite , by sigma - clipping around the cmr",
    ", we are selecting the oldest cluster galaxies at any given redshift , not the cluster population that will evolve into the @xmath90 cmr population .    although the cmr is observed in large area galaxy surveys out to @xmath191 @xcite , we know that the cmr evolves .",
    "striking evidence for the formation of the cmr and its dependence on environment was recently demonstrated by @xcite . while there is a clear cmr in the field , groups , and clusters at @xmath90 ,",
    "the field cmr is not present at @xmath171 , and becomes less defined in groups at @xmath171 and @xmath192 .",
    "this was detected as an increase in cmr scatter as a function of increasing magnitude .",
    "building on this theme , we find no evidence for evolution , other than passive , in the bright end of the cmr ( l @xmath193 ) , in agreement with many other studies @xcite .",
    "however , considering cmr galaxies down to @xmath194 , we find tentative evidence for a dependence of cmr slope on cluster x - ray luminosity or mass , in the sense that less luminous clusters have steeper slopes . if this is confirmed by further studies , it must be due to a combination of downsizing , where the fainter , less massive cmr galaxies form later than the brighter , more massive ones in a given cluster , and an overall younger age for faint cmr galaxies in the lower mass clusters .",
    "if downsizing were not invoked , meaning all cmr galaxies form simultaneously , then younger clusters should have flatter slopes .",
    "earlier studies of the scatter in lower redshift clusters could only put a lower limit of @xmath195 for the average formation redshift of the cmr galaxies ( e.g. van dokkum et  al .",
    "now that we can observe galaxy clusters in this redshift range , we can put much stronger constraints on their formation redshifts .",
    "the range @xmath196 is emerging as crucial for understanding the formation of massive cluster ellipticals and their transition from rapidly star - forming to passive .",
    "although semianalytic and hydrodynamic models of galaxy formation are now able to reproduce a color bimodality of galaxies from @xmath197 @xcite , they still produce bright blue galaxies at @xmath90 , the sfrs of most model red galaxies decline only slowly after @xmath198 , and is driven by major merging events @xcite .",
    "the star formation decline is much too slow to reproduce the tight cmrs found in @xmath199 clusters , and major merging including gas ( dissipative mergers ) is not observed to occur for a significant fraction of massive cluster galaxies .",
    "what these models probably do get right is that the color bimodality of galaxies is driven by major differences in their progenitor star formation histories at @xmath200 , which we can hopefully test by continuing to push our observations outward in redshift .",
    "we presented an analysis of the color - magnitude relation in cl1604 + 4304 ( @xmath44 ) and cl1604 + 4321 ( @xmath89 ) , both part of the 16h supercluster @xcite . based on their x - ray luminosities ,",
    "both of these clusters are at the low mass end of the range of previously studied clusters at @xmath201 .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "* both 4304 and 4321 have identifiable early - type color - magnitude relations",
    ". however , cl1604 + 4321 , the less massive of the two clusters , lacks bright @xmath202 ellipticals , and we suggest that it has not yet had time to assemble bright early - type red sequence members . from our analysis of the cmr relations , we find a redder zeropoint for 4321 .",
    "the cmr slope and scatter depend strongly on our choice of initial color cuts , and the possibility of significant differences in slope and scatter between 4304 and 4321 is open . *",
    "the slope of the combined cluster cmr is significantly steeper than for rx  j0152.7 - 1357 but consistent with ms  1054 - 03 , both at similar redshift .",
    "this may be due to the difference in magnitude limit used for the fitting , the different observed filters , or a real difference in the galaxy populations .",
    "the slope of the cmr at the bright end ( @xmath189  l@xmath7 ) is flatter and consistent with the cmr slopes found for other high redshift clusters . * from the intrinsic scatter about the cmr for the full sample of 65 e+s0 galaxies , we find an average galaxy age of @xmath125  gyr , and an average @xmath203 .",
    "* we find evidence for an increasing intrinsic scatter with increasing magnitude , previously only known in the group and field environment at these redshifts .",
    "this implies an decreasing mean galaxy age with decreasing galaxy mass , of about 0.15  gyr from @xmath204 to @xmath205 .",
