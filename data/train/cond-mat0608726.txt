    "these features suggest that the behavior of excitons in polymer chains can be very close to that of an ideal semiconductor quantum wire system .    in this paper , we study excitons in a polymer chain coupled to a single electromagnetic mode in a cavity .",
    "the resulting mixed states of excitons and cavity photons can be describes in terms of polariton quasiparticles .",
    "we will focus on the properties of polaritons in the presence of a deformation potential interaction with the lattice .",

    "excitons are modeled as excitation of two level systems localized within the unit cells of the polymer chain , and a variational mean field approach is used to calculate the properties of the ground state of the systems at zero temperature as a function of the density of polaritons .",
    "a similar approach was used to study the transition between a polariton bose einstein condensate ( bec ) to a laser - like behavior for polaritons in a cavity .",
    "@xcite the coupling to the lattice by the deformation potential adds new features to the ground state properties of polaritons .",
    "we will show that a self - trapping  @xcite of polaritons occurs at a threshold value for the polariton density .",
    "this mechanism could give rise to a bec of polaritons which localize spontaneously without the need of external traps or strain fields .",
    "compared to the semiclassical treatment we have used in the case without cavity ,  @xcite the description in terms of cavity - polaritons give a clearer picture of the physics of the self - trapping process , and introduces new features related to the strong exciton - cavity photon coupling .",
    "although our model contains a single cavity mode , we expect the result to be relevant also in the description of organic systems in planar cavity geometries , for which interesting interplays of the exciton - cavity and exciton- lo phonon dynamics have been predicted .",
