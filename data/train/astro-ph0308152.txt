    "the general theory of relativity is logically one of the most compelling theories of modern physical science .",
    "however being a physical theory it is imperative that it should not only describe as many different physical phenomenon as possible but also make accurate predictions of physical quantities relevant to observations .",
    "as regards the accuracy in prediction the general theory of relativity has done extremely well in all its known tests such as the perihelion shift of mercury , deflection of light , and gravitational redshift experiments@xmath0 .",
    "however the range of applicability where general theory of relativity can be compared with direct observations has remained small , owing to the fact that under normal physical situations on earth and inside the solar system it is very difficult to differentiate its predictions from other rival theories such as the newton s theory of gravitation , even when it is considered under its linear approximation .",
    "the discovery of compact x - ray sources in the universe has opened up new avenues to the test general relativity in naturally existing systems . in these astrophysical laboratories",
    "extreme physical conditions are encountered which are impossible to be reproduced on earth . for example@xmath1 densities of a usual compact x - ray source",
    "is of the order up to @xmath2 @xmath3 and rotational periods @xmath4 . under such conditions",
    "general relativity provides not only a consistent picture of various physical aspects of the phenomenon but also predicts , with unprecedented accuracy , magnitudes of various physical parameters involved such as the timing of rotational periods and their decay with time@xmath5 . on the other hand",
    "all such systems are composed of atoms existing under a very strong gravitational field . within the classical theory",
    "these atoms can be taken as forced harmonic oscillators whose physical behavior depends very much on the background gravitational field .    in this paper",
    "we study the effects of gravitational field on the behavior of such oscillators within the framework of the general theory of relativity .. after giving a preliminary introduction , we write the equations of motion for a forced harmonic oscillator in section 2 , making a plausible physical assumption that the star is rotating slowly ( i.e. , far below the speed of light limit ) . in section 3",
    "we discuss the solution to the equations of motion and especially their behavior near the resonant frequency . in section 4",
    ", we give the behavior of the oscillators for compact astrophysical objects and also give a comparison .",
    "lastly a brief summary and conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "according to the general theory of relativity@xmath6 the motion of a free particle of gravitational mass @xmath7 is given by the geodesic equation    @xmath8    where @xmath9 @xmath10 are the position coordinates of the test particle and @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the affine parameter and @xmath13 is the christoffel symbol , where @xmath14 is the metric tensor and ` @xmath15 ' denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "let the metric tensor be expressed as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 @xmath19 is the minkowski metric tensor and @xmath20 is the perturbation to the metric .",
    "then under the linear approximation @xmath21 we can take time @xmath22 as the affine parameter . requiring rotation to be slow",
    "( i.e. , neglecting square and higher powers of velocity vector @xmath23 ) we obtain the following expression for acceleration for a slowly rotating sphere of homogeneous mass density    @xmath24    where    @xmath25    and",
    "@xmath26    @xmath27 being the mass density and @xmath28 is the volume . here the remarkable formal analogy of the above results with the classical electromagnetic theory must be noticed with the _ proviso _ that a factor of 4 is to be multiplied with the gravitomagnetic vector potential @xmath29 . pursuing this analogy , we find@xmath30 that for a slowly rotating sphere of homogeneous mass density first term in expression ( 3 ) is the gravitoelectric ( ge ) potential given by the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the mass of the gravitating source , and @xmath33 unless mentioned otherwise ) .",
    "moreover there is the gravitomagnetic ( gm ) potential @xmath34 where    @xmath35    @xmath36 being the radius and @xmath37 is the angular velocity of the gravitational source .",
    "the second part of equation ( 3 ) has a non - newtonian origin .",
    "it is regarded to exhibit typically einsteinian effects and therefore plays an important role in testing einstein s theory of gravitation in the weak field and slow rotation approximation@xmath38 .",
    "the independence of the gm potential from a particular frame and from a particular coordinate system used has been demonstrated thus making it physically significant@xmath39 .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as ` gravitomagnetic current ' induced in the vicinity of the gravitational source due to its rotation . for its analogy with the lorentz force law for the electromagnetic field",
    "the force @xmath40 is often referred to as gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) force .",
    "however to measure the effects of this force on a given physical system high accuracy in experiments is required where it is necessary to isolate the experimental setup from contingencies@xmath41 .",
    "let us consider a forced damped harmonic oscillator having two degrees of freedom placed in a gem field .",
    "if @xmath42 is the inertial mass of the test particle then in addition to the binding force @xmath43 , the damping force @xmath44 , and an external force @xmath45 acting along , say , the x direction , there also acts on the particle a gem force @xmath46 .",
    "considering the ge field of magnitude @xmath47 to be along y - axis and the gm field of magnitude @xmath48 in the direction normal to the xy - plane@xmath49 , we find that the gem force has a component @xmath50 in the x direction and a component @xmath51 in the y direction ; where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the components of velocity in the x and y directions respectively . with these additional terms and the fact that @xmath54 , in accordance with the general theory of relativity , we get the equations of motion as a coupled system of ordinary differential equations    @xmath55    @xmath56    now let us introduce the auxiliary variable @xmath57 , then the equations of motion give a single equation    @xmath58    notice that the gm parameter @xmath48 has a coupling to the damping parameter @xmath59 in the complex plane ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "dimensional analysis of equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) shows that @xmath48 must have dimensions of cycles per second i.e. , of frequency .",
    "these considerations give rise to the question whether these ` gravitomagnetic oscillations ' produce significant effects on the physical behavior of an oscillatory system .",
    "as we shall see in the following that the answer to this question must be given in affirmative .",
    "however these effects are extremely small except in those cases where density and rotational frequency of the gravitational source are extremely large , such as those found in compact astrophysical x - ray sources .",
    "the exact solution to equation ( 9 ) can be obtained , however we are interested in studying the behavior of amplitude especially near the resonant frequency .",
    "to do so we express @xmath61 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the complex amplitude@xmath64 substitution in equation ( 9 ) gives    @xmath65    multiplying the last expression with its complex conjugate and taking square root we have the following real expression for the amplitude    @xmath66    comparing this expression for the amplitude with the expression for the amplitude of a forced damped harmonic oscillator having two degrees of freedom we notice that there are two main differences , one the addition of @xmath67 dependent terms in the numerator , two an addition of the term @xmath68 , in the denominator , to the square of eigenfrequency @xmath69 of the system .",
    "the second difference is of particular importance since it involves the effect of gm field on the resonant frequency of the system . to estimate this effect we notice that in equation ( 11 ) for small damping i.e. , @xmath70 and given values of the parameters @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ", the amplitude @xmath63 is maximum when @xmath74 i.e. , when the applied frequency is approximately @xmath75 expanding in powers of @xmath76 and requiring that @xmath77 we obtain the following approximate result for resonant frequency    @xmath78    this result shows that there is a shift in the resonant frequency by an amount @xmath79 .",
    "the outer atmosphere of a white dwarf consists mainly of fully ionized @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 atoms forming a crystalline structure in which electrons can be taken as forced harmonic oscillators , moving under the influence of lattice vibrations@xmath83 . along the radial direction",
    "the motion of these electrons is very much limited by the ge attraction and the fermi pressure , therefore in any thin layer enveloping the star the electrons can be taken as oscillating with two degrees of freedom . as the star of mass greater than the chandrasekhar limit exhausts its thermonuclear fuel the ge force not only contracts the core ( increasing the mass density per unit area ) , its angular frequency also is increased from @xmath84 @xmath85 cycle per second@xmath86 to @xmath87 or above . to study the resonant behavior of these electrons we begin with relatively less severe case of white drawf of mass @xmath88 and radius @xmath89 rotating at frequency @xmath84 .",
    "then the case of the pulsar of mass @xmath90 and radius @xmath91 rotating at frequency @xmath92 is studied .",
    "finally we consider a neutron star of mass @xmath93and radius @xmath94 rotating at frequency @xmath95 . in these cases",
    "@xmath96 @xmath97 , where @xmath98 ranges from @xmath99 ( for the white dwarf ) to @xmath100 ( for the pulsar ) to @xmath101 ( for the neutron star ) ; consequently @xmath102 varies from order @xmath103 to @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the phase .",
    "now from equation ( 6 ) we have in the equatorial plane at the surface of the star i. e. , @xmath106 :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 . for the above given values of the relevant physical parameters we have from expression ( 13 ) , @xmath48 is @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for the whitedwarf , the pulsar and the neutron star respectively . with these values of parameters",
    "we plot the resonance curves , using expression ( 11 ) , for the three cases in figure ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for electron with eigenfrequency @xmath95 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we notice that for a slow rotating pulsar the resonance shift @xmath114 is not very large ( about @xmath115 ) as compared with the shift for the case of the neutron star ( about @xmath116 ) .",
    "the above considerations can be summed up as follows : _ under the influence of gravitomagnetic field of a rotating compact star there is a shift in the resonant frequency of an oscillator lying in its vicinity .",
    "the shift depends on the density and on the rotational frequency of the star . _    inside the solar system and especially in terresrial laboratories the detection of gravitomagnetic resonance shift is very unlikely ( for earth @xmath48 is approximately @xmath117 and for the sun it is @xmath118 ) .",
    "however for compact gravitational objects the shift lies in the domain of observations .",
    "these observations may not be directly possible at present , but with further theoretical as well as observational developments , it may well become possible to provide evidence for such an effect .",
