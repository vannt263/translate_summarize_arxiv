    "recently , the @xmath1-ray backward scattering cross sections were measured and compared with the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the results show that some of the @xmath1-rays can be scattered completely backward in a coherent and elastic way .",
    "this fact implies that a @xmath1-ray emitted from a radioactive nucleus can return to the source nucleus without any energy loss when a suitable reflector is applied .",
    "the nuclear energy level width has been known as a solidly determined and unchangeable quantity .",
    "although there have been several attempts to change it by altering the chemical state @xcite and by applying high pressure @xcite or low temperature @xcite , only negligible changes , i.e. , less than @xmath5 , were observed .",
    "thus , attempts at substantial modifications of the nuclear lifetime have failed .",
    "nevertheless , it is a very attractive problem to modify the lifetime , equivalently the energy level width , because the nuclear waste problem must be solved .",
    "if the lifetime becomes shorter , waste cleaning processes may be accelerated . while , prolongation of the lifetime implies suppression of radioactivity .",
    "furthermore , narrowing the width ( equivalently lengthening the lifetime ) would be useful for longer storage of radioactive material for some purposes .",
    "a more important point is that precision measurement of the @xmath1-ray spectra may be improved .",
    "namely , the accuracy of the m \" ossbauer experiment might be improved if the width of its absorption spectrum could made narrower .    on the other hand",
    ", it is also known that spatial structure of the vacuum field can change the atomic and nuclear energy levels and widths @xcite .",
    "that is to say , if space is limited by two perfect conducting plates on the surface of which all wave functions vanish , the vacuum field becomes discrete and , therefore , induces some modification of physical quantities .",
    "however , observable effects could only be obtained for plates with separations on the order of micrometers @xcite .    a mssbauer experiment carried out to observe nuclear energy level shifts @xcite discovered that the width became narrower @xcite ; then , the data were carefully reanalyzed @xcite .",
    "usually , broadening occurs easily due to various noises but narrowing is very difficult .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to investigate the mechanism of such a phenomenon which must be different from the effects of the chemical environment .",
    "we should stress here that we are not talking about a reduction of broadening due to various noises but a reduction of the natural line width itself .",
    "a novel idea has been proposed @xcite to explain the phenomenon found in the mssbaur experiment .",
    "if the photon emitted from the source could partially return and be reabsorbed by the original source , the duration for the source nucleus to stay in the excited state would effectively increase ; and consequently , the nuclear half - life could be prolonged , equivalently , the width of this state could become narrower . in free space ,",
    "return of the emitted photon to the source is impossible .",
    "however , the photon may be forced to return to the source by operating reflectors , say metallic plates or a cylinder .",
    "a process in which even a part of the photon returns and is reabsorbed by the source nucleus after backscattering on the metal surface would cause suppression of photon emission .",
    "when such a process is repeated many times , the lifetime is finally prolonged .",
    "of course , all these processes such as emission , backscattering and absorption should occur elastically , i.e. , without any energy loss .",
    "therefore , the source nucleus should be implanted in a solid .",
    "one step of photon reabsorption would cause only a tiny modification of the lifetime , but iterative processes would proceed step by step until the probability for finding the nucleus in the excited state would become half @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be the probability for finding the system in the state @xmath7 at the time @xmath8 , whether a single - particle or many - particle system .",
    "this state is assumed to be unstable and , therefore , decays , i.e. , by @xmath1 emission in our case .",
    "then , its decay equation reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the decay constant .",
    "thus , the state can generally be expressed as @xmath11 .\\ ] ] the state has a complex energy eigenvalue because it is unstable , and @xmath12 is the width of the state .",
    "the state @xmath7 given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) satisfies , of course , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and @xmath13 .",
    "the validity of the expression in eq .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath14 can immediately be verified by taking a fourier transform of @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 } ; \\ ] ] then , @xmath17}.\\ ] ] this last equation represents a lorentzian spectrum , and @xmath12 is definitely the width of the state @xmath7 .    since the decay rate can not be measured experimentally with a single - particle system , the measurement is always carried out by means of a particle assembly .",
    "however , one can obtain an identical answer by repeating the measurements again and again with a single particle under the same conditions .",
    "this is due to the fundamental concept of quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore , we investigate the process with an assembly of nuclei instead of a single nucleus , which is fundamentally the same as phenomena occurring with a single nucleus .",
    "if emitted photons return once to the source after being scattered coherently by a metal surface and are reabsorbed , the decay equation with the decay constant @xmath18 is given as @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "even if @xmath21 is replaced by @xmath6 , this equation holds as it is .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the probability associated with photon reabsorption .",
    "therefore , the second term stands for the effect of @xmath1 reabsorption .",
    "equation ( 5 ) is valid for the time interval @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25speed of light , and @xmath26 is the distance between the source and the metallic surface where the photon is scattered ) during which the photon returns only once .",
    "thereby , the decay constant @xmath18 is effectively modified as @xmath27 .    for the @xmath28th return of the photon ,",
    "i.e. , for the time interval @xmath29 , the decay equation is generally expressed as @xmath30 integration of this equation over that time interval yields @xmath31 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the limit @xmath32 should be taken in the final stage and @xmath33 for @xmath34 , the photon has no time to return to the source , i.e. , @xmath35 ; therefore , @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 . by iteration , we find @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath41 , it becomes @xmath42 = n_0 \\ : exp(-\\lambda t ) $ ] , where @xmath43 .",
    "this result is usual ; i.e. , nothing changes because of @xmath44 .",
    "equation ( 9 ) indicates that the decay constant is changed step by step at every stage in the reabsorption of returning photons .",
    "let us find the value of @xmath28 by setting @xmath45 because the number of radioactive nuclei becomes half of the initial amount at the @xmath46th step .",
    "namely , @xmath47 which gives",
    "@xmath48 \\over ln ( 1-\\sigma ) }           = { ln [ 1- ( c \\ : \\tau_{1/2 } / 2r ) \\sigma ] \\over ln ( 1-\\sigma )           } , \\ ] ] where we used @xmath49 and @xmath50 . by introducing the effective decay constant @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) for @xmath52 , it can be rewritten as @xmath53 with @xmath54 rewriting eq . ( 11 ) as @xmath55 and substituting this result with eq . ( 11 ) into eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we obtain the expression of @xmath51 as @xmath56 \\over ln ( 1-\\sigma ) } \\ : .\\ ] ] as we explained in the beginning , the discussion here with an assembly of @xmath21 nuclei is actually independent of @xmath21 , and the same result can be obtained with the state @xmath14 .",
    "namely , @xmath51 is the modified decay constant of the state , and @xmath57 is the modified width of the state .    because @xmath58 , the decay is delayed ; thus , the level width appears narrower .",
    "accordingly , the modified lifetime is now found to be @xmath59 } \\over { ln ( 1-\\sigma ) }          } .\\ ] ] as we have seen above , the photon reabsorption process is repeated m times before the half - life of the state is formed .",
    "indeed , that process directly participates to build the half - life .",
    "it is not simple radiation trapping , but in the course of photon reabsorption , the nuclear lifetime has been gradually build up step by step .",
    "let us now investigate the @xmath60backscattering by the metallic cylinder .",
    "the elastic scattering of @xmath61rays from the metal surface is coherent and mostly caused by atomic electrons . for an incident photon energy much larger than the atomic binding energy , the scattering can be described in a good approximation by the seagull term of the corresponding feynman diagrams , i.e. , by @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the electron mass and charge , respectively , @xmath67 is the velocity of light , and @xmath68 is the form factor given by the @xmath69ray energy @xmath70 and scattering angle @xmath71 . with the cartesian components of @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 we find @xmath75 for unpolarized beams , the differential cross - section appears in the form @xmath76 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & = & ( { { e^2 } \\over { m_e c^2 } } ) ^2 \\ : |f(e_\\gamma,\\theta)|^2 \\ :    { 1 \\over 2 } ( 1+cos^2\\theta ) \\ : .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since photon coherent scattering by protons in the nucleus may take place simultaneously , one has to take it into account .",
    "this scattering can be described in analogy with the atomic case , provided the electron mass is replaced by the proton mass . however",
    ", its contribution is actually negligible compared to that of the scattering by atomic electrons because the proton mass is much larger than the electron mass .",
    "now , only photons scattered entirely backward can successfully return to the source to be reabsorbed .",
    "assuming the nucleus to be a point particle because the nucleus is much smaller than the photon wavelength , one may express the backward scattering cross section @xmath77 as @xmath78    since the photon is scattered by the atoms in a metallic cylinder of thickness @xmath79 , we must count the number of atoms per @xmath80 .",
    "this number can be given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the number of atoms per @xmath83 , and can be obtained from the density divided by the atomic mass : @xmath84 with avogadro s number @xmath85 . when the @xmath86ray comes from a direction at a angle of @xmath87 from the normal direction of the cylinder surface",
    ", @xmath79 must be replaced by @xmath88 . for this case",
    ", the number of atoms per @xmath89 should be @xmath90 .",
    "since the scatterers are bounded in the solid , the effect of lattice vibration should be taken into account .",
    "it can be done by introducing the debye - waller factor @xcite .",
    "therefore , backward scattering cross section @xmath91 should be multiplied by this factor .",
    "generally , radioactive nuclei emit @xmath61rays isotropically , so the total number of photons emitted during the time @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath18 is the decay constant , @xmath21 is the number of radioactive nuclei at a certain time , @xmath94 is an element of area on a sphere of arbitrary radius @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the surface density of photons passing through this area , when the initial number of photons is @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath96 is given by @xmath98 this relation holds for the sphere of any arbitrary radius , i.e. @xmath99    let us consider a element of area @xmath100 at a point on the cylinder surface that is located at the distance @xmath95 from the center .",
    "since @xmath101 , we find @xmath102 where the relations @xmath103 and @xmath104 are used .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the surface density of photons on an element of area @xmath107 of the cylinder when an initial number of photons , @xmath97 , comes .",
    "@xmath108 is the surface density of photons on @xmath107 when a single incident photon comes in .",
    "of course , the total number of photons emitted during @xmath92 can be obtained by integrating over a cylinder surface of infinite length @xmath109 in addition , a photon that needs to travel a distance @xmath95 contributes @xmath110 times as much as one travelling @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath22 is expressed by an integral over the cylinder surface ; i.e. , @xmath111 \\left ( { cos^2 \\psi sin \\psi \\over 4\\pi r^2 } \\right ) { r^2 \\over cos^2 \\psi } \\ : d \\psi \\ : d\\theta\\\\ \\nonumber   & = & 2 \\zeta \\ : { 2\\pi \\over 4 \\pi } \\int_0^{\\psi_l } ( nd \\ : f \\sigma_\\pi   ) \\ : sin \\psi \\ : d\\psi \\\\ \\nonumber   & = & \\zeta \\ :",

    "the cross sections of coherent and incoherent scattering of gamma rays from a nucleus are calculated by the formulae given in ref . 23 .",

    "the result was @xmath131 at @xmath132 , i.e. , the probability of @xmath61absorption by @xmath133 in the @xmath134 compound is about @xmath135 .",
    "this value can be compared to the relative depths of the absorption spectra observed in mssbauer experiments , which are all about @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "the agreement is good , so the value of @xmath113 calculated using eq.(29 ) is reliable .",
    "let us examine our theory .",
    "as above , the conditions to maximize the effect is to select a material which has a large debye temperature and which induces large backward scattering .",
    "furthermore , the energy of emitted gamma - ray , @xmath137 , should be less than @xmath138 .",
    "otherwise , the debye - waller factor becomes very small , and the effect is greatly reduced . if @xmath139 is less than @xmath140 , various noises associated with detectors become large , and clean data may not be obtained .      considering the above conditions",
    ", we try to examine the first excited state , the @xmath141 state of @xmath142 , which is @xmath2-kev level with a lifetime of @xmath143 . to eliminate the recoil effect",

    "when a compound @xmath144 is taken , @xmath145 decays into @xmath142 through the electron conversion process because @xmath146 is radioactive , so @xmath147 remains in the compound .",

    "the compound @xmath144 has a perovskite structure with a rather high debye temperature , @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "although , the debye temperature of the perovskite resulting from the decay of @xmath146 into @xmath151 is not actually known , it may be assumed to be the same as that of @xmath152 because both of them have the perovskite structure and @xmath146 simply converts to @xmath151 through the ec process .",
    "therefore , the debye temperature @xmath153 is taken for @xmath154 .",

    "other processes , so - called `` radiation trapping '' , were also investigated @xcite , and a prolonged nuclear lifetime was observed @xcite .",
    "the interpretation was that the time evolution of gamma - ray emission was modulated as a result of the time consumed during photon exchange between two radioactive nuclei .",
    "namely , the photon is delayed in coming out of the system while the two nuclei play with the photon .",
    "however , it has no relevance to the lifetime unless the energy level width is modified .",
    "the level width and lifetime can be changed only when population of the excited state is increased through the mechanism discussed above . in conclusion",
    ", a sharper spectrum can be obtained by using the method proposed here , and the accuracy in measuring the @xmath61ray spectrum can be improved .",
    "radiation trapping can occur even without modification of energy levels , but such a simple `` trapping '' can not have any effect on the mssbauer spectrum connected directly to the energy level width .",
    "measurements should be carried out at low temperatures with specific detectors with good timing performance and good energy resolution .",
