    "it is classified as a strong liquid in the angell scheme @xcite because the temperature dependence of its dynamics displays an arrhenius behavior .",
    "interestingly , oxygen and silicon dynamics are characterized by different activation energies .",
    "close to the glass transition temperature @xmath0 the difference between the self - diffusion constants for oxygen @xmath1 and silicon @xmath2 is nearly two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the viscous dynamics of liquid silica close to @xmath0 is strongly controlled by the silicon dynamics @xcite .",
    "the large difference in diffusivity indicates different relaxation mechanisms for oxygen and silicon atoms in liquid silica at low temperatures .",
    "the decoupling of silicon and oxygen single - particle dynamics has been already studied via computer simulations of sio@xmath3 @xcite modelled by the bks potential @xcite .",
    "it turned out that in the limit of very high temperatures the diffusive dynamics of oxygen and silicon is similar ( @xmath4 ) . upon cooling",
    "the slowdown in silicon dynamics is significantly stronger as compared to that in oxygen dynamics .",
    "this results in a faster decrease of @xmath2 at low temperatures , e.g at 2800k one has @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this has been regarded as an evidence for a _",
    "decoupling dynamics_. interestingly , the temperature dependence of the average time - scale for the lifetime of si - o bonds follows @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the self part of the van hove correlation function for oxygen displays a clear additional peak , which corresponds to the hopping dynamics .",
    "in contrast , no clear hopping peak is present for the case of silicon @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent study on the facilitated dynamics in liquid silica @xcite shows that the cooperative motion for oxygen dynamics can be described by a string - like motion @xcite whereas the usual string - like motion is absent for the case of silicon atoms .",
    "the potential energy landscape ( pel ) has been shown to be an indispensable tool to elucidate the nature of the dynamics and thermodynamics of liquids @xcite . in this framework",
    "the dynamics of the system is represented by the dynamics of a point in the high dimensional configurational space @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of the system can be expressed in terms of the statistical properties of the inherent structures ( is ) , i.e. the local minima of the pel @xcite . naturally , the essential features observed in the small subsystem are trivially averaged out on a macroscopic level @xcite . therefore , to understand the decoupling dynamics in terms of the pel properties it is important to analyze sufficiently small systems without relevant finite - size effects .",
    "recent studies on the _ thermodynamics _ of this model have shown that the distribution of is energies @xmath8 possesses a low - energy cutoff @xmath9 @xcite . below @xmath9",
    "the configurational energy is strongly depleted as compared to the gaussian distribution , which describes @xmath8 for @xmath10 .",
    "an important step to characterize the _ dynamics _ has been the introduction of metabasins ( mb ) @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a coarse - graining of the configuration space .",
    "groups of minima between which the system performs forward and backward jumps are regarded as single states , i.e mb .",
    "the total dynamics can then be formally described as a sequence of jumps between mb , each characterized by a waiting time @xmath11 and an energy @xmath12 which is chosen as the minimum is energy of the corresponding group of is . actually , the distribution @xmath8 of mb energies is virtually identical to that of is such that the thermodynamics does not change when switching from the is to the mb description .",
    "it turns out for silica that on this level of description the oxygen dynamics of the system can be ( to a good approximation ) characterized as a random - walk in configuration space with a temperature - independent average hopping distance @xcite .",
    "this provides a strong link between long - range transport and microscopic dynamics . as an immediate consequence the temperature dependence of @xmath6",
    "is determined by the temperature dependence of the average waiting time .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the diffusion and relaxation in liquid silica has been related to the defect structure @xcite since close to defects the mobility is largely enhanced .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we want to show why the decoupling of oxygen and silicon dynamics as well as the proportionality of the oxygen diffusion with the inverse bond lifetime is a natural consequence of the nature of the dynamics of bks - silica .",
    "it will turn out that it is the presence of rotational displacements which are the origin of the decoupling .",
    "second , we will relate the occurrence of these specific displacements to the properties of the pel .",
    "this will be another example where the reference to properties of the pel gives new insight into the complex dynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "in sect.ii we present some computational details . in sect.iii",
    "we show a detailed analysis of the nature of the mb transitions . in this way",
    "the relevance of rotational processes is elucidated .",
    "based on these results we can unambiguously explain the decoupling of the oxygen and silicon diffusion in terms of these processes , as shown in sect.iv . in sect.v",
    "the rotational processes are related to properties of the pel .",
    "we close with a discussion and a summary in sect.vi . in particular , we show that the general physical picture of the relaxation processes in silica , as derived in our previous work @xcite , is fully compatible with the results , obtained for the relation of the oxygen and silicon dynamics in this work .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of liquid silica at constant volume and energy ( microcanonical ensemble ) . the density of liquid silica is @xmath13 g@xmath14 , which is similar to that in previous simulations @xcite .",
    "the standard bks potential @xcite is used to describe the interaction energy for liquid silica .",
    "the coulombic interaction is calculated with the ewald - summation technique .",
    "the short range interaction is truncated and shifted to zero at the cutoff radius @xmath15 . to avoid an energy drift @xmath15",
    "is set to 8.5  , which is slightly larger than the one used previously @xcite . in this work",
    "we analyze the temperature range from 2800k to 4000k , using well - equilibrated samples .",
    "all results have been averaged over three independent runs in order to gain better statistics .",
    "it has been shown that for bks - silica a system size of approx .",
    "100 particles with periodic boundary conditions is sufficient to avoid relevant finite - size effects for the configurational entropy , the relaxation dynamics of bks - silica ( in terms of the diffusive activation energy and the degree of non - exponentiality in the incoherent scattering function ) in the accessible temperature range and the properties of tunneling systems @xcite . as in our previous work",
    "we use a system size of @xmath16 . to characterize the distance between two configurations we use the displacement of the oxygen atoms if not mentioned otherwise .    for each equilibrium",
    "run , the system is quenched via the standard conjugated - gradient method .",
    "the times for the quench have been optimized via the bisectioning method to enable an efficient search for the precise location of the metabasin transitions @xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain a time series of is energies , which contains all relevant is transitions which are necessary to characterize all mb transitions .",
    "as mentioned above mb are characterized by a waiting time @xmath11 and an energy @xmath12 .",
    "the energy of a mb is defined as the lowest is energy in a mb ( see @xcite for a precise definition of mb ) .    for later purposes we introduce two different energy distributions , relevant at temperature @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the boltzmann weighted distribution of mb energies at temperature @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it expresses the probability that at a randomly given time the system is in a mb of energy @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the average waiting time of a mb with energy @xmath12 . @xmath22 denotes the probability that after a mb transition the new mb has the energy @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in the previous studies on the binary lennard - jones system ( bmlj ) it has been shown that the mean square displacement @xmath23 after @xmath24 transitions between mb is independent of temperature except for extremely high temperatures for which minima of the pel are not relevant due to the dominance of anharmonic effects @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath25 is related to the average mb waiting time @xmath26 via a temperature - independent jump length @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28    here we repeat this analysis for the oxygen and silicon dynamics in silica by calculating @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ; see fig.[osimbr2 ] .",
    "one directly observes that @xmath29 is temperature - independent whereas there is a significant and systematic temperature shift of @xmath30 .",
    "actually , the temperature independence of @xmath29 has been already used in our previous work @xcite to justify the use of eq.[eqdtau ] also for silica .",
    "of course , the decoupling of oxygen and silicon directly follows from the different behavior of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    the average mean square displacement of oxygen and silicon after @xmath31 mb transitions , i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the value of @xmath24 indicates the number of mb transitions . for the weak but significant temperature dependence of @xmath32 in the constant regime for large @xmath24",
    "one obtains 1.3 @xmath33 , 1.2 @xmath33 , 0.9 @xmath33 and 0.8 @xmath33 for the four temperatures ( starting from high temperatures ) , respectively .",
    ", width=325 ]    on a qualitative level these observations agree with the previous analysis of the decoupling of oxygen and silicon @xcite . by analyzing the time decay @xmath34 of the si - o bond residual time",
    ", horbach and kob observed that @xmath35 does not depend on temperature whereas @xmath36 shows a significant temperature dependence at low temperatures .",
    "@xmath34 should be proportional to the waiting time of mb @xmath37 because typical mb transitions will involve bond - breaking events @xcite .",
    "thus the previous observations @xmath38 but @xmath39 are indeed qualitatively equivalent to the results in fig.[osimbr2 ] .    but how to rationalize the temperature dependence of @xmath30 ?",
    "the most simple explanation would be that typical silicon displacements during mb transitions are smaller at lower temperatures . in this case",
    "the temperature dependence would reflect a change of the jump mechanism with temperature . in literature",
    ", the complicated relaxation of silicon atoms has been related to the possible presence of deep potential traps for silicon @xcite . in this scenario , however , one would expect that there is also a systematic temperature dependence for , e.g. @xmath40 , which corresponds to the typical displacement after one mb transition .",
    "interestingly , in our simulations we have not found such a temperature dependence ; see fig.[osimbr2 ] .      here",
    "we show that a different scenario is responsible for the observations , shown in fig.[osimbr2 ] . for each time series of",
    "is ( mb ) at different temperatures , we have observed some rotational processes .",
    "more precisely this means that during the time evolution the system is found in different configurations which are identical except for a permutation of oxygen atoms .",
    "the most simple realization of rotational processes are rotations of a sio@xmath41 tetrahedral unit along the three - fold ( c@xmath42 ) or two - fold ( c@xmath3 ) axis but also more complex permutations have been observed .    to elucidate this possibility in a quantitative way we first define _ rotational periods _ as the maximum time intervals @xmath43 $ ] with the property that",
    "the configurations at @xmath44 and @xmath45 are identical except for the permutation of oxygen atoms .",
    "of course , during one rotational period several rotations may take place . to characterize the dynamics during a rotational period",
    "further one can identify the different oxygen permutations .",
    "they are denoted _ rotational states_. naturally , each rotational period contains at least two rotational states but also more may be present .    in fig.[timeseries ]",
    "a sequence of is is shown .",
    "the different rotational states which are visited during this time period are indicated .",
    "note that within the rotational period the system may escape from a rotational state and either come back to the same state or end up in another permutation of oxygen atoms .",
    "typically , subsequent rotational states are not connected by a single saddle but rather by high - energy is .",
    "we note in passing that for all simulation runs we have not observed any permutation of silicon atoms .",
    "the time intervals between the rotational periods are denoted _ translational periods _ ; see fig.[timeseries ] . whereas the contributions from the long - time dynamics of oxygen atoms come from rotational and translational periods , the long - time dynamics of silicon atoms",
    "is exclusively related to the translational periods .    on average ,",
    "many is transitions are required for the system to go from one rotational state to another ; see fig.[timeseries ] . during this time",
    "also the silicon atoms display significant motion but finally go back to the original position . from a single - atom perspective during rotational processes the position of some oxygen atoms change .",
    "thus , rotational processes contribute to the long - range dynamics of oxygen as opposed to that of silicon .",
    "the simulation data show that rotational periods become more relevant at low temperatures ( see below for a quantification of this statement ) .",
    "thus , the fraction of mb transitions which finally are irrelevant for the silicon dynamics increases with decreasing temperature . from this observation",
    "it is indeed expected that @xmath30 is smaller at lower temperatures as observed in fig.[osimbr2 ] .",
    "furthermore , a much weaker temperature dependence should occur for @xmath40 because on the single - transition scale a silicon atom hardly realizes that a few mb - transitions later it will go back to the original configuration .",
    "stated differently , the strong forward - backward correlations of the silicon dynamics during the rotational periods should show up by a stronger subdiffusive behavior in @xmath30 in agreement with fig.[osimbr2 ] .",

    "the translational and rotational periods are labeled by * trans * and * rot * , respectively.,width=325 ]    the average mean square displacement of silicon @xmath46 after @xmath31 mb transitions .",
    "in contrast to fig.1 only mb transitions within the translational periods are taken into account.,width=325 ]    the hypothesis that the slowing - down of silicon is exclusively due to the presence of rotational periods can now easily be tested . for this purpose",
    "we have calculated @xmath47 by ignoring the mb transitions during the rotational periods .",
    "thus for this analysis we only count mb transitions during the translational periods , as indicated by the index _ trans_. the result",
    "is shown in fig.[sitransr2 ] . within statistical uncertainties",
    "one observes a temperature - independent behavior .",
    "this unambiguously shows that the decoupling of oxygen and silicon dynamics is _ exclusively _ due to the increasing relevance of rotational processes at lower temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the non - diffusive part for small @xmath48 , reflecting deviations from a pure random - walk behavior , becomes smaller and similar in size to that of the oxygen dynamics in fig.[osimbr2 ] . from the large - n@xmath49 behavior of @xmath50",
    "the proportionality constant can be interpreted as an effective jump - length @xmath51 .",
    "it is shown in fig.[d2all ] . as expected , no relevant temperature dependence is observed .",
    "temperature dependence of the rotational and translational spatial factors @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for mb transitions ( see definitions in text).,width=325 ]    is the oxygen dynamics different in rotational as compared to translational periods ? starting with the oxygen dynamics during rotational periods",
    "we first determine the number of mb transitions @xmath55 and the squared displacement @xmath56 during the i - th rotational period .",
    "formally , @xmath56 is the squared euclidian distance between the first and the last configuration of a rotational period.then one can define the effective oxygen hopping distance @xmath54 during rotational periods via @xmath57 its temperature dependence is also shown in fig.[d2all ] .",
    "again , within statistical uncertainties no temperature dependence is observed .",
    "formally , the total displacement of the oxygen atoms during the translational periods can be obtained from the total mean square displacement during the whole simulation run minus the contributions from the rotational periods , i.e. @xmath58 . for the number of mb transitions @xmath48 in the translational periods one simply has @xmath59 . in analogy to eq.[eqroto",
    "] one can define @xmath60 as the effective hopping distance during the translational periods .",
    "again , as seen in fig.[d2all ] also this observable does not display any significant temperature dependence .",
    "the ratio of @xmath61 is close to three which is larger than the statistical factor of 2 .",
    "thus , the silicon dynamics is indeed somewhat more hindered than the oxygen dynamics .",
    "this reduction in mobility , however , is temperature - independent for the range of temperatures , analyzed in this work .",
    "apart from the temperature - independence one observes a surprising similarity of @xmath54 and @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that , maybe in contrast to expectation , the nature of the oxygen dynamics in translational time intervals is similar to that in rotational time intervals .",
    "in the final part of this section we discuss some properties of the transitions between rotational states .",
    "these results will shed some light on the relation between the pel - properties and the actual dynamics , as will be discussed in sect.vi .",
    "first , we analyze the typical distance in the configuration space between successive rotational states . for this purpose",
    "we define @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the number of transition between different rotational states , added over all rotational periods .",
    "its temperature dependence is shown in fig.[d2succ ] . upon cooling @xmath64 increases .",
    "this means that the typical distance between subsequent rotational states becomes larger for lower temperatures , i.e. more complex oxygen permutations occur . as an immediate consequence on average more mb transitions are necessary at lower temperatures to reach a new rotational state within the same rotational period .",

    "furthermore , a very small fraction of more complex permutations with larger displacements is observed .",

    "furthermore we checked for two temperatures that for our system parameters the ratio does not depend on the system size within statistical accuracy .",

    "mbs are mainly characterized by energy and residence time . in literature",
    "it has been shown that the energy plays an important role for the dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , one may expect that energy also affects the nature of the mb transitions in the present context . in order to check the energy dependence for the rotational and translational transitions ,",
    "we determine the number of mb transitions in the rotational periods @xmath74 and the translational periods @xmath75 in dependence on mb energy @xmath12 . from eq.[eqratioexplain ] @xmath76 can be written as @xmath77    @xmath22 has been defined in eq.[eqdefvarphi ] and denotes the probability that a mb has the energy @xmath12 .",

    "a small value of @xmath78 thus implies that after leaving a mb of energy @xmath12 the system very likely will later on end up in a rotational state . the energy and temperature dependence of @xmath78",

    "most importantly , @xmath78 depends strongly on energy whereas it does not show any significant temperature dependence . in fig.[ptrans](a ) one can separate the energy dependence of @xmath78 into two regimes . in the high - energy regime",
    "one has @xmath79 .",
    "this means that no significant rotational processes happen for high - energy mb .",
    "when the mb energy decreases , rotational processes become relevant .",
    "this results in a decrease of @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly , more than 90% of the transitions involving mb with energies close to the cutoff energy @xmath9 contribute to the rotational dynamics . from the present results we have to conclude that energy not only determines relaxation rates as shown in the previous studies @xcite but",
    "also determines the relevance of rotational processes .",

    "much less than 1% of all configurations possess an energy less than @xmath91 ev ; see fig.[varphi ] .",
    "in contrast , nearly every second mb has an energy less than @xmath90 . as a consequence for mb with @xmath92 the pel supplies many adjacent configurations of similar energy with connecting saddles of at most 1 ev which the system may easily reach , giving rise to non - activated dynamics whereas in the low - energy limit this is no longer possible due to the lack of such configurations .    for rationalizing the features , observed in this work , we discuss in qualitative terms the distribution of mb in configuration space relative to a given mb ( denoted _ central _ mb ) with energy @xmath93 , visited at a given temperature @xmath19 .",

    "we have calculated @xmath98 for one representative low - energy configuration and have exchanged the indices of the oxygen atoms via monte - carlo techniques . to determine the distribution over many orders of magnitude we have used appropriately adjusted flat - histogram techniques @xcite .",
    "the resulting distribution @xmath98 is shown in fig.[gd2d2 ] .",
    "one can clearly see a few peaks for smaller distances and a transition to a continuous behavior for larger distances . naturally , the @xmath95-values of the peaks agree with those observed during the actual transitions between rotational states . for @xmath100 @xmath33",
    "this distribution no longer shows any wiggles .",
    "this reflects the fact that a transition with a large value of @xmath95 can be achieved by a multitude of different oxygen permutations .",
    "in contrast , for small @xmath95 discrete distances can be identified which belong to specific types of reorientations ( like @xmath101 rotations ) .",
    "comparison with the actually observed transitions in fig.[pd2d2 ] shows that in particular more complex permutations , related to larger values of @xmath95 , are strongly suppressed .",

    "one may naturally write @xmath103 with @xmath22 defined in eq.[eqdefvarphi ] . qualitatively , this means that for regions sufficiently far away from the central mb the distribution of mb is not influenced by the presence of a mb with @xmath104 at the origin .",
    "one expects that for large @xmath95 the distribution @xmath105 increases much faster than @xmath98 , i.e. with a larger exponent of @xmath95 , because @xmath105 contains the exponentially larger number of different is as well their permutations ( except for those taken into account by @xmath98 ) .",
    "thus , for large @xmath95 one expects @xmath106 .",
    "this dramatic difference may disappear for small @xmath95 because the ratio of both functions becomes smaller for smaller @xmath95 .",

    "the system would have to reach regions of the configuration space which are far away from the central mb . as a consequence , for purely statistical reasons the probability to complete",
    "the exchange process is very small .",
    "( iii ) as discussed above for small @xmath95 the function @xmath98 may be of the same order as @xmath105 . furthermore , @xmath113 is very small for @xmath114 , see fig.[varphi ] , implying @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "thus , for statistical reasons the relevance of rotational states is significantly enhanced for very low energies .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath117 the system possesses a large number of adjacent is with similar energy such that again for statistical reasons the probability to reach one of the rotational states is very small .",
    "( iv ) as a further consequence the range of distances for which the probability to find a rotational state is non - negligible increases with decreasing energy .",
    "thus , in agreement with observation one would expect an increase of the average distance between successive rotational states with decreasing energy and thus with decreasing temperature .",
    "( v ) as discussed above for the transition from one low - energy configuration ( @xmath116 ) to a new low - energy configuration the system first has to climb up the pel to energies close to @xmath90 .",
    "this trajectory basically forms an energy - upwards path without major intermediate barriers @xcite . in analogy",
    ", the subsequent path to a new low - energy configuration is not expected to possess significant barriers , in similarity to the funnel - like picture of protein folding",
    ". stated differently , the search for the subsequent low - energy configuration is basically entropy - driven so that @xmath118 , indeed , should not significantly depend on temperature .",
    "( vi ) whether or not the system ends up in a rotational state is mainly a question of the statistical availability of these states . as a consequence",
    "one would expect that the nature of the oxygen dynamics in translational and rotational periods should not differ too much .",
    "this is consistent with the observed similarity of @xmath54 and @xmath60 .",
    "according to eq.[eqener ] the fraction of the rotational and translational dynamics is related to the thermodynamic weighting of the mb population , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of @xmath119 presented above is just a consequence of the temperature dependence of @xmath22 .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the value of @xmath71 at the glass transition temperature @xmath0 ( 1450k ) . from the density of mbs @xmath8 and waiting time @xmath120 one can predict @xmath22 at @xmath0 . by using eq.[eqener ] the estimated value for @xmath71 at @xmath0",
    "is of the order of @xmath121 , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental value of @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be resolved in different ways : ( i ) at lower temperatures further decoupling mechanisms set in .",
    "( ii ) the temperature - independence of @xmath118 no longer holds for temperatures closer to the calorimetric glass transition . (",
    "iii ) the limits of the bks - potential to predict the details of the oxygen and silicon dynamics in silica are reached .    the present pel approach to characterize the dynamics of oxygen and silicon",
    "allows one to obtain a relatively simple physical picture about the oxygen dynamics as well as the silicon dynamics . the essential key ingredient to understand the onset of the decoupling of oxygen and silicon diffusion is the presence of rotational dynamics which only contributes to the oxygen dynamics and which can be rationalized in simple statistical terms in the framework of the pel approach .",
    "excluding the rotational periods , the difference in activation energies of silicon and oxygen disappears in the considered range of temperatures ."
