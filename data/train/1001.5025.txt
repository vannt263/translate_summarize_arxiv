    "the curious presence of heavy elements in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs has been known since the discovery of the first degenerate stars ; van maanen 2 is the prototype dz white dwarf @xcite . for more than half a century",
    "it has been understood that , in the absence of radiative forces , elements heavier than hydrogen and helium should rapidly sink below the photosphere in the high gravity environment of white dwarfs @xcite ; hence metal - lined white dwarfs like vma 2 must be externally polluted .    owing to a relatively low atmospheric opacity , the detection of calcium in the optical spectra of more than one dozen cool , single , helium - rich ( dz ) white dwarfs preceded the availability of 8 m class telescopes and high resolution ccd spectrographs @xcite .",
    "although the sinking timescales are always orders of magnitude shorter than the white dwarf cooling age , heavy elements can persist for up to @xmath2yr in the sizable convection zones of helium - rich degenerates @xcite .",
    "this fact led somewhat naturally to the hypothesis that the source of the accreted heavy elements was the interstellar medium ( ism ) , encountered in sufficient density a few to several times per galactic orbit ( on average ) for the solar neighborhood @xcite .    several factors have continually challenged the ism pollution scenario .",
    "first , the typical dearth of hydrogen relative to calcium in dz stars argues for the accretion of volatile depleted material @xcite .",
    "second , the firm establishment of the hydrogen - rich daz spectral class , with heavy element diffusion timescales as short as a few days , and galactic positions far from known interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "third , the increasing number of metal - contaminated white dwarfs with infrared excesses and closely orbiting rings of dusty and gaseous debris @xcite .",
    "thus , while there is firm observational evidence of pollution via circumstellar material , as yet there is none favoring the ism .",
    "@xcite provided an extensive spatial , kinematical , and calcium abundance analysis against which they tested likely scenarios of interstellar accretion based on the best available data at that time , concluding interstellar accretion could not explain the abundances in _ any _ of their 15 dz white dwarfs .",
    "however , their landmark study was limited to targets within 50pc for the most part , and to stars that were proper - motion selected , and hence biased toward higher space velocities @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined possible correlations between the current positions of 35 daz white dwarfs and models of the surrounding ism as inferred from nearby column density measurements , finding a lack of sufficient material to account for most polluted stars .",
    "this paper returns to the question of the origin of the dz spectral class . historically , the dz stars outnumbered their hydrogen - rich counterparts stars by 25:1 @xcite until high resolution , spectroscopic searches with large telescopes uncovered a commensurate number of daz stars @xcite .",
    "today , the ratio of known dz to daz stars is greater than 4:1 , due almost exclusively to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ability to detect mild levels of heavy element pollution in these stars , combined with the relative lack of circumstellar material at both the dz and cool daz white dwarfs @xcite , makes the origin of the dz stars challenging to constrain .",
    "it is argued here that the hundreds of newly identified , cool , helium - rich white dwarfs from the sdss provide an excellent , spatially and kinematically unbiased sample upon which to test the ism accretion hypothesis .",
    "these stars form a large statistical sample that favors an alternative to the accretion of galactic gas and dust ; as a whole the sdss dz stars do not show the spatial , kinematical , or elemental abundance correlations expected from accretion episodes within the plane of the galaxy . furthermore , the sdss dz and dc ( helium - rich , featureless ) stars appear to be similar populations of polluted and non - polluted stars broadly sharing all relevant characteristics save photospheric calcium , and perhaps hydrogen .",
    "the sdss fourth data release ( dr4 ; @xcite ) contains a prodigious number of new white dwarfs , in the neighborhood of 6000 @xcite . excluding multiple entries for the same source , binaries or binary candidates , and uncertain classifications , there are 95 dz and 142 dc stars within the dr4 white dwarf catalog . under further scrutiny",
    ", @xcite has expanded the number of confirmed , unique dz stars to 146 , providing effective temperatures , calcium abundances , and photometric distances under the assumption of @xmath3=8.0 $ ] . of these 288 cool",
    ", helium - rich white dwarfs in dr4 , only one was known previously ; g111 - 54 or sdss j080537.64@xmath4383212.4 @xcite .    perhaps surprisingly , the current number of dc and dz stars in the sdss are nearly identical . the dr4 catalog autofit temperatures for helium - rich stars are generally unreliable near or below 10000k , as their helium atmosphere models do not extend below this temperature @xcite .",
    "owing to this fact , the dc star spectroscopic and photometric data were fitted using the same technique and helium - rich ( metal - free ) models as in @xcite , yielding effective temperatures and photometric distances , again assuming @xmath5 .",
    "all photometric data were taken from the dr4 white dwarf catalog @xcite , with stellar parameters for the dz stars from @xcite and the dc model fits performed for this work .",
    "spatial and kinematical data for these white dwarfs were obtained from the sdss seventh data release ( dr7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this latest data release includes the usno - sdss derived proper motion catalog of @xcite and its recent amendments @xcite , with statistical errors around 3masyr@xmath6 . for a handful of white dwarfs , proper motions were not available in the dr7 catalog ; for these stars measurements were taken from the supercosmos science archive ( ssa ; @xcite ) , the lspm catalog @xcite , or were calculated for this work based on two or more positions on archival photographic plates and sdss images separated by approximately 50 years .",
    "these proper motions are listed in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    ".white dwarf proper motions unavailable in sdss dr7[tbl1 ] [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]      a white dwarf accreting solar ratio abundances at the high eddington rate for 10@xmath7yr will obtain about @xmath8 g of hydrogen , and it is tempting to imagine the hydrogen masses in figure [ fig2 ] represent an accumulation of such encounters .",
    "@xcite plots a similar figure but including hydrogen masses in warmer dba white dwarfs from @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the hydrogen envelope masses in dba stars are one to a few orders of magnitude smaller than those in the dza , making it plausible that as helium - rich stars cool and accrete ism gas , the hydrogen accumulates .",
    "if helium - rich stars gradually accumulate hydrogen from the ism as they cool , there should exist a significant population of cool , helium - rich white dwarfs that reveal themselves as da stars , which has not yet been observed @xcite .",
    "accreted hydrogen should perpetually float in a helium - rich star , while any metals eventually sink below detectability ; this expectation is corroborated in high - resolution spectroscopy of db stars , where the metal - free dba outnumber the dbaz stars 15:1 @xcite .",
    "while this ratio should decrease in the cooler dza temperature range as diffusion timescales and atmospheric opacity favor a more frequent detection of calcium , the relative number helium - rich da and dza stars should remain larger than unity for all scenarios where metals and hydrogen have distinct origins .",
    "this arises because separate sources for hydrogen and metals , in helium atmosphere white dwarfs , imply independent probabilities , and being polluted by both will be the least probable . therefore ,",
    "if one assumes that metals result from accreted asteroids but under - abundant hydrogen in a cool , helium atmosphere is either 1 ) interstellar , 2 ) primordial , or 3 ) the result of dredge up and subsequent mixing , a larger than unity ratio of metal - free counterparts to the dza stars is certain .",
    "however , if the photospheric metals and hydrogen both have a circumstellar origin , and are semi - continuously delivered to the photosphere on relevant timescales , the ratio of helium - rich da to dza stars can potentially be less than unity .",
    "there are three mixed helium - hydrogen atmosphere stars among the 152 cool white dwarfs thoroughly studied and modeled by @xcite ; two are dza stars ( ! ) , while the third has atmospheric carbon ( where dredge up of interior carbon and helium in a previously hydrogen - rich atmosphere is a possibility ) . while this ratio of 1:2 ( or 0:2 ) results from small number statistics , it may nonetheless be telling .",
    "the significant populations of dc and dz stars , coupled with the relative lack of cool , helium - rich da white dwarfs supports a circumstellar origin for hydrogen in dza stars .",
    "furthermore , occam s razor favors a single mechanism that can account for all the data simultaneously ; hydrogen delivered together with heavy elements in water - rich minor planets is one such possibility .",
    "@xcite offer this hypothesis to explain , with a single pollution event , the collective facts available on the spectacularly metal - enriched , mixed helium - hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf gd 362 .",
    "this disk - polluted , helium - rich star has an anomalously high hydrogen abundance at [ h / he ] @xmath9 @xcite , so much that it was originally classified as daz @xcite .",
    "gd 16 is a similar case with significant atmospheric hydrogen @xcite and a dust disk polluting its helium - dominated atmosphere @xcite , while the two remaining helium - rich white dwarfs with disks ( gd 40 and ton 345 ) have little or no hydrogen @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pattern of hydrogen abundances in dz stars is likely a reflection of the diversity of water content in extrasolar planetesimals .",
    "owing to the fact that radial velocities are not reliably measurable from the calcium lines in the sdss spectra of the dz stars , some of the derived kinematical quantities are modestly uncertain .",
    "fortunately , the galactic latitudes of the 146 stars are bound within @xmath10 , and potential biases are mild at worst . for example , although the calculation of @xmath11 velocity here is missing the third dimensional ingredient , which could potentially alter its sign ( and hence direction ) , a non - zero radial velocity will tend to increase their speeds in any given direction [ @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the focus of the study has been statistical in nature and the global properties of the sample are unlikely to change @xcite    _ gaia _ will eventually obtain distances to , and excellent proper motions for , most if not all the dz and dc white dwarfs , the latter stars being immune to radial velocity measurements by nature ( until more powerful instruments resolve any potential lines in their spectra ) .",
    "empirical distance determinations will remove any bias introduced with the assumption of @xmath5 , but again this is unlikely to be problematic from a statistical point of view @xcite .    perhaps more important",
    "is the current understanding of how interstellar accretion occurs ; this ignorance alone can sweep up many uncertainties , just as passing stars may sweep up ism , but this situation is not ideal , and empirical constraints are superior . although the propeller mechanism hypothesis may be currently broken , or minimally in need of repair @xcite , this does not rule out the _ logical _ possibility of preferential accretion for heavy elements ( grains ) versus gas while a star traverses a patch of ism . however , there are two worthwhile considerations for any such hypothesis .    first , based on reasonable physics in the absence of propeller - like deterrents , the infall of gas onto a star via",
    "the ism should proceed at a rate much higher than the analogous accretion of grains (  3.4 ) .",
    "two additional factors should further increase the accreted volatile - to - refractory element ratio : 1 ) the intrinsic gas - to - dust ratio in the ism is around 100:1 , and 2 ) interstellar grain species should be separated further in the accretion process owing to varying evaporation temperatures @xcite . at present there does not exist a large number of cool white dwarf spectra exhibiting sufficient elements to confidently evaluate the volatile - to - refractory element ratios . obtaining such",
    "a database would be highly valuable .",
    "second , there is a class of main - sequence star which is thought to accrete ism and become polluted in the _ opposite _ sense to contaminated white dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath13 bootis stars are a class of late b to early f stars that show nearly solar abundances of light elements but are deficient in metals @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that their abundance ratios mimic the metal - depleted pattern of interstellar gas @xcite , and that accretion - diffusion of this volatile - enriched gas is consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "since @xmath13 bootis stars are generally a - type dwarfs where convection has become important , they should share some basic characteristics with cool white dwarfs in the appropriate effective temperature range .",
    "if the @xmath13 bootis stars are polluted by interstellar , metal - poor gas , then any ism accretion theory for white dwarfs should be able to account for both classes of stars , and explain specifically why preferential accretion would favor heavy elements in the case of white dwarfs , contrary to reasonable physical expectations .",
    "the sdss currently contains a large number of cool , metal - polluted , helium atmosphere white dwarfs over a relatively large volume of the local galaxy .",
    "these dz stars appear to be , on average , atmospherically , spatially , and kinematically similar to a comparable number of dc white dwarfs from the same catalog , at least superficially .",
    "a search for correlations between calcium and hydrogen abundances , spatial and kinematical properties among the dz stars yields negative results , excepting a tendency for increased hydrogen mass with cooling age in dza stars .",
    "specifically , the metal abundances of 146 dz stars shows no connection with speed relative to the lsr , nor with height above the galactic disk .",
    "the super - solar [ ca / h ] ratios and lower limits are as expected for the dz spectral class , but nonetheless difficult to understand as accretion of matter which is over 97% hydrogen and helium .",
    "the substantial fraction of the dz sample which sits at @xmath14pc is difficult to reconcile with accretion of ism , perhaps impossible .",
    "the total space velocities of these high @xmath15 stars are no slower than their counterparts within the galactic gas and dust layer , and hence no more amenable to accretion of rogue ism patches , which are unlikely to exist in any case .",
    "these 96 stars have spent 3 to 40myr above the 100pc half - width scale height of ism , with 91 spending at least 6 myr , the latter time period sufficient to drive their metal abundances down by a factor 400 .",
    "the calcium masses currently residing in the convective regions of the dz stars are near 10@xmath16 g on average .",
    "if one assumes the calcium represents 1.6% of the total mass ( equivalent to the bulk earth ; @xcite ) of heavy elements in the stellar envelope , then a typical dz star contains a mass equivalent to a 150 km asteroid .",
    "this is the _ minimum _ mass of accreted heavy elements .",
    "if a large percentage of dz stars have retained metals from a past encounter within a few to several myr diffusion timescales , then the present envelope masses of heavy elements represent only a fraction of the accreted masses and invoking total captured masses as large as the moon .    simply taking the 146 dz stars out of 4193 dr4 white dwarfs with @xmath17k",
    ", one can say that at least 3.5% of white dwarfs appear to be polluted by circumstellar matter , the remains of rocky planetary systems .",
    "this translates directly into a similar lower limit for the formation of terrestrial planets at the main - sequence progenitors of white dwarfs , primarily a- and f - type stars of intermediate mass . while this fraction is likely to be significantly higher @xcite , it is difficult to quantify without a commensurate examination of all the cool sdss white dwarfs , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the appearance of hydrogen in dza stars suggests a common origin for both heavy elements and hydrogen , and indicates dza star pollution by water - rich minor planets may be semi - continuous on myr timescales .",
    "this picture can be tested by searching for sensitive features of oxygen absorption in hydrogen- and metal - polluted white dwarfs .",
    "the authors thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments which improved the quality of the manuscript .",
    "special thanks go to n. dickinson , s. preval , and d. harvey for assistance in mining the sdss database .",
