    "the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams)@xcite , whose final version ams-02 is to be installed on the international space station ( iss ) for at least 3 years , is a detector designed to study the cosmic ray flux by direct detection of particles above the earth s atmosphere using state - of - the - art particle identification techniques .",
    "ams-02 is equipped with a superconducting magnet cooled by superfluid helium .",
    "the spectrometer is composed of several subdetectors : a transition radiation detector ( trd ) , a time - of - flight ( tof ) detector , a silicon tracker , anticoincidence counters ( acc ) , a ring imaging erenkov  ( rich ) detector and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "[ amsdet ] shows a schematic view of the full ams-02 detector . a preliminary version of the detector , ams-01 , was successfully flown aboard the us space shuttle discovery in june 1998@xcite .",
    "the main goals of the ams-02 experiment are :    * a precise measurement of charged cosmic ray spectra in the rigidity region between and , and the detection of photons with energies up to a few hundred gev ; * a search for heavy antinuclei ( @xmath0 2 ) , which if discovered would signal the existence of cosmological antimatter ; * a search for dark matter constituents by examining possible signatures of their presence in the cosmic ray spectrum",
    ".    the long exposure time and large acceptance ( 0.5 m@xmath1sr ) of ams-02 will enable it to collect an unprecedented statistics of more than @xmath2 nuclei .",
    "one of the subdetectors in ams-02 is a proximity focusing ring imaging erenkov  ( rich ) detector .",
    "it is composed of a dual radiator with silica aerogel ( @xmath3  1.050 ) and sodium fluoride ( @xmath3  1.334 ) , a high reflectivity lateral conical mirror and a detection matrix with 680 photomultipliers coupled to light guides .",
    "the rich detector will provide a very accurate velocity measurement ( in aerogel , @xmath4 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath6 for @xmath7  1 and @xmath7  10  @xmath8  20 , respectively ) and charge identification of nuclei up to iron ( @xmath7  26 ) .",
    "rich data , combined with information on particle rigidity from the ams silicon tracker , enable the reconstruction of particle mass .",
    "a typical rich event is shown in figs .",
    "[ amsdisplay1 ] and [ amsdisplay2 ] , where the latter gives a detailed view of the readout matrix .",
    "the accuracy of the rich velocity measurement is essential due to the growth of relative errors when @xmath9 :    @xmath10    the assembly of the ams rich detector is currently underway at ciemat in madrid .",
    "the integration of the rich and the other subdetectors of ams-02 will take place at cern in 2007 .",
    "the analysis of rich data involves the identification of the erenkov  ring in a hit pattern which usually includes several scattered noise hits and an eventual strong spot in the region where the charged particle crosses the detection plane .",
    "two independent algorithms for velocity and charge reconstruction have been developed in the ams collaboration for the analysis of rich events : a geometrical method based on a hit - by - hit reconstruction@xcite , and a method using all the hits with the maximization of a likelihood function@xcite ) .",
    "a prototype of the rich detector , consisting of 96 photomultiplier units , was tested both with cosmic ray particles and with beam ions at the cern sps in 2002 and 2003 .",
    "a piece of the conical reflector was included in the beam test setup@xcite .",
    "the algorithms for velocity and charge reconstruction were successfully applied to data from these prototype tests@xcite .",
    "protons are the most abundant component ( @xmath11  90% ) of charged cosmic rays reaching the earth s vicinity .",
    "the remaining fraction is essentially made of atomic nuclei ( mostly @xmath12he ) and single - charged particles such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "precise measurements of the smaller components in the cosmic ray spectrum are essential in the context of the study of cosmic - ray production and acceleration .",
    "the required precision can only be attained through very effective charge and mass discrimination methods since the abundances of different components differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "ratios such as d / p , @xmath16he/@xmath12he and b / c give information on the interstellar medium since all compare the abundances of secondary and primary species .",
    "the beryllium isotope ratio @xmath17be/@xmath18be is a probe for galactic confinement times since both isotopes are secondary but one of them , @xmath17be , is unstable ( @xmath19  1.5 @xmath20 10@xmath21 yr ) .",
    "the lightest neutralino ( @xmath22 ) , predicted by supersymmetric models , is a strong dark matter candidate .",
    "if it exists and accounts for the known dark matter density ( @xmath23 ) or at least for a significant part of it , neutralino annihilation ( @xmath24 ) must take place and contribute to the observed cosmic ray composition , with the more visible effects occurring in the spectra of antiparticles like @xmath14 , @xmath15 and especially @xmath25@xcite .",
    "[ antidsusy ] shows a comparison between the expected @xmath25 fluxes from secondary production and from dark matter annihilation .",
    "to evaluate the capabilities of ams-02 for mass separation of deuterons and antideuterons from other particles with the same charge , studies have been performed using the case of deuteron vs. proton separation . in the past",
    ", studies on the separation of helium ( @xmath7  2 ) and beryllium ( @xmath7  4 ) isotopes have also been performed using a standalone simulation of the rich detector@xcite . in the present case the large difference between proton and deuteron abundances ( d / p @xmath11 1% ) increases the importance of a very effective mass separation to isolate the deuteron signal from a large background of proton events .    in the study of d / p separation a full - scale simulation of the ams detector",
    "particles were simulated as coming from the top plane of a cube , corresponding to an acceptance of 47.78 m@xmath1sr .",
    "three data samples were chosen .",

    "@xcite .    in each event",
    "a set of preliminary data selection cuts using readings from different subdetectors of ams-02 was applied to reduce the fraction of events with a bad reconstruction . only downgoing events ( @xmath31 ) were accepted .",
    "in addition , events were accepted if the following conditions were satisfied :    * only one particle was detected in the event ; * a particle track was reconstructed by the silicon tracker ; * no clusters were found in the anti - coincidence counters ; * clusters from at least 3 tof planes ( out of 4 ) were used for event reconstruction ; * at most one additional cluster was allowed in the tof ; * at least 6 tracker layers ( out of 8) were used in the track reconstruction ; * compatibility was required for the rigidity measurements obtained from two different algorithms , with ; * compatibility was also required for the rigidity measurements obtained from each half of the tracker ( upper and lower ) , with ; * the particle s impact point on the rich radiator was less than 58 cm from the centre ( i. e. more than 2 cm from the mirror ) ; * at most one track was present in the trd ; * the tof and tracker charge reconstructions were compatible .    among the events that triggered the detector , a fraction corresponding to of proton events and of deuteron events in the relevant region of kinetic energy ( few gev / nucleon ) passed this set of preliminary cuts , corresponding to an acceptance of @xmath11  0.3 m@xmath1sr for protons and @xmath11  0.2 m@xmath1sr for deuterons .",
    "the reconstruction of particle masses was then performed for events having a signal in the rich detector .",
    "the extremely accurate velocity measurement provided by the rich ( @xmath4 10@xmath5 in the case of protons and deuterons ) is crucial to reduce the background level .",
    "a series of event selection cuts were introduced , based on data provided by the rich and the results of the two reconstruction algorithms :    * a erenkov  ring was reconstructed using each method , and at least 3 hits were used in both cases ; * the total ring signal was not higher than 10 photoelectrons in naf events , and not higher than 15 photoelectrons in aerogel events ; * a kolmogorov test to the uniformity of the hits azimuthal distribution in the ring gave a result of at least 0.2 in the case of naf events , and 0.03 in the case of aerogel events ; * compatibility was required for the velocity measurements from the tof and rich detectors , with ; * compatibility was also required for the velocity measurements obtained from the two rich reconstruction methods , with for naf events , and for aerogel events ; * the reconstructed , rounded electric charge obtained from the geometrical method was 1 or 2 ; * the reconstructed , non - rounded electric charge obtained from the likelihood method was between 0.5 and 1.5 in naf events , and between 0.6 and 1.4 in aerogel events ; * the ring acceptance ( visible fraction ) , as estimated by the likelihood method , was at least 20% in naf events , and at least 40% in aerogel events ; * the number of noisy hits not associated to the crossing of the charged particle ( i. e. , hits that were far from the reconstructed ring and far from the estimated crossing point of the charged particle in the detection matrix ) was not higher than 2 in naf events , and not higher than 3 in aerogel events .",
    "results show that mass separation of particles with @xmath7  1 is feasible even if one species is orders of magnitude more abundant than the other .",
    "d / p separation is possible up to @xmath32  8 gev / nucleon .",
    "some examples of the mass distributions obtained are shown in figs .",
    "[ imassagl ] and [ imassnaf ] .",
    "solid lines show the mass distributions before the rich cuts were taken into consideration .",
    "[ dpratio1day ] shows the expected sensitivity of ams for the d / p ratio after one day of data taking .",
    "results show that a single day of ams-02 statistics will be sufficient to improve on the existing data for this ratio .    in the optimal region immediately above the aerogel radiation threshold ( @xmath33  5 gev / nucleon ) rejection factors higher than 10@xmath12 region were attained ( fig .  [ nrejfac ] ) .",
    "the best relative mass resolutions for protons ( fig .  [ massres ] ) and deuterons are @xmath11  2% for both radiators in the regions above their respective thresholds .    after all cuts , an acceptance of @xmath11  0.07 m@xmath1sr was obtained for protons , and @xmath11  0.05 m@xmath1sr for deuterons at ( fig .",
    "[ pdaccep ] ) .",
    "the increase by a factor @xmath11  10 in the acceptance above the aerogel threshold reflects the relative dimensions of the two radiators in the rich detector .",
    "the main background in the deuteron case comes from non - gaussian tails of proton events with a bad velocity reconstruction .",
    "errors in rigidity reconstruction ( @xmath34  2% in the gev region ) are not critical for this case .",
    "the specific set of cuts shown here corresponds to an example of a selection procedure .",
    "other variations are possible . in particular , rejection factors may be improved by applying stricter cuts , at the expense of a further acceptance reduction .",
    "ams-02 will provide a major improvement on the current knowledge of cosmic rays .",
    "a total statistics of more than 10@xmath17 events will be collected during its operation .",
    "detailed simulations have been performed to evaluate the detector s particle identification capabilities , in particular those of the rich .",
    "simulation results show that the separation of light isotopes is feasible . using a set of simple cuts based on event data , relative mass resolutions of @xmath11  2",
    "% and rejection factors higher than 10@xmath12 have been attained in d / p separation at energies of a few gev / nucleon .",
