    "black holes in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces are quite different from black holes in flat or de sitter ( ds ) spaces . in",
    "asymptotically flat or ds spaces , the horizon topology of a four dimensional black hole must be a round sphere @xmath0  @xcite . in ads spaces , except for the positive constant curvature horizon , it is possible to have black holes with zero or negative constant curvature horizons  @xcite-@xcite . due to the different horizon structure ,",
    "the associated thermodynamic properties of black holes are rather different .",
    "indeed , for the schwarzschild black holes in ads spaces , there is a phase transition ( named as hawking - page phase transition ) between the high temperature black hole phase and low temperature thermal ads space  @xcite . in the ads",
    "/ cft ( conformal field theory ) correspondence  @xcite , thermodynamics and phase structure of black holes in ads spaces can be mapped to those of dual cfts .",
    "it has been argued by witten  @xcite that the hawking - page phase transition of schwarzschild black holes in ads spaces can be identified with confinment / unconfirment phase transition of dual cfts . as for the phase transition , it has been indeed found that for the ads black holes with zero or negative constant curvature horizon , the hawking - page phase transition does not appear and black hole are always locally thermodynamically stable with positive heat capacity  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the electric charge of ads black holes can be mapped to the r - charge of supersymmetric dual cfts  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of equal interest to study thermodynamics and phase structure of ads charged black holes .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that phase structure of ads charged black holes is rather rich because of the presence of charge , for example , see @xcite .",
    "however , most studies on the ads charged black holes are restricted to the case with black hole horizon being a positive constant curvature hypersurface .",
    "note that the fact that ads black holes with zero curvature horizon can be the large horizon limits of the ads black holes with positive constant curvature horizon  @xcite , and that the so - called hyperbolic ads black holes , namely , ads black holes with negative constant curvature horizon , belong to another branch .",
    "it is therefore of necessary to investigate thermodynamics and phase structure of hyperbolic charged black holes and to see what main differences are among ads charged black holes with different characteristic curvature horizons .",
    "this is just the goal of the present paper .    when the gauge charge is present , we can consider two different ensembles to study thermodynamics of charged black holes  @xcite .",
    "one is the grand canonical ensemble in which the gauge potential ( chemical potential conjugate to the electric charge ) is fixed .",
    "the other is the canonical ensemble where the physical electric charge is fixed . in these two ensembles ,",
    "the associated free energies are the gibbs free energy and helmholtz free energy , respectively .",
    "when the gibbs free energy or helmholtz free energy is negative , the black hole phase is dominant over the thermal ads background phase .",
    "this case implies that the black hole is globally stable , or say , globally preferred .",
    "when the gibbs ( helmholtz ) free energy changes its sign , the hawking - page phase transition appears between the ads black hole and thermal ads background  @xcite . here the thermal ads background corresponds to the case with vanishing mass parameter and gauge charge , and the ads background as the vacuum background is assumed when we calculate the free energies associated with ads black hole solutions .",
    "another important property of black hole thermodynamics is the local stability , which in fact indicates whether a black hole can be in thermal equilibrium with the thermal bath around the black hole .",
    "for example , it is well - known that a schwarzschild black hole can not be in thermal equilibrium within an infinite thermal bath .",
    "this is because the heat capacity of the schwarzschild is negative .",
    "namely , when the mass of the black hole increases , the temperature of the black hole decreases .",
    "we will also discuss the local stability of hyperbolic charged black holes , which is determined by heat capacities in different ensembles .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we start with the hyperbolic reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "there we stress how to rewrite the solution in the isotropic coordinates and how to appropriately choose parameters to parameterize the solution so that the parameters can cover the whole phase space , which acts as service to the consequent related discussions for the hyperbolic black holes in d=5 , 4 , and 7 dimensional gauged supergravities . for the hyperbolic rn black holes , we find that the gibbs free energy is always negative , and the heat capacity with a given electric potential or a given electric charge is also always positive , but the helmholtz free energy can change its sign . in sec .",
    "iii , iv and v , we discuss the hyperbolic black holes in d=5 , 4 and 7 dimensional gauged supergravities , respectively . due to the appearance of nontrivial scalar fields ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties and stability of the black holes get changed from the case of hyperbolic rn black holes .",
    "we present our main conclusions and give some discussions in sec .  vi .",
    "let us start from an @xmath1-dimensional ads rn black hole @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the line element of an unit @xmath4-dimensional sphere and the function @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass parameter and electric charge of the black hole , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is related to the @xmath1-dimensional cosmological constant via @xmath10 .",
    "for the solution ( [ 2eq1 ] ) , one has to have @xmath11 , otherwise , the singularity at @xmath12 is naked .",
    "when @xmath13 , the solution turns out to be supersymmetric and the function @xmath5 can be written as @xmath14 obviously the solution in this case does not describe an ads black hole , but a naked singularity . defining @xmath15",
    "the solution ( [ 2eq1 ] ) can be rewritten in the isotropic coordinates as @xmath16 where @xmath17 in this form the supersymmetric limit is obtained by taking @xmath18 while keeping @xmath19 finite .",
    "furthermore , if introducing the so - called boost parameter @xmath20 @xmath21 the harmonic function @xmath22 can be written as @xmath23 , the physical electric charge of the solution @xmath24 , and the supersymmetric limit corresponds to the case @xmath25 and @xmath26 while keeping @xmath19 finite .",
    "the electric potential of the solution ( [ 2eq5 ] ) is @xmath27 note that in the schwarzschild coordinates ( [ 2eq1 ] ) , two integration constants are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and they are independent of each other . in the isotropic",
    "coordinates ( [ 2eq5 ] ) , they are changed to @xmath28 and @xmath19 , and they could be related to each other via the relation ( [ 2eq7 ] ) .",
    "in addition , in the solution ( [ 2eq5 ] ) , @xmath29 ( and then @xmath30 via ( [ 2eq7 ] ) ) . otherwise , the solution describes a naked singularity .",
    "now we turn to the hyperbolic charged ads black hole , whose metric is  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two integration constants , @xmath33 stands for the line element for an @xmath4-dimensional hypersurface with negative constant curvature @xmath34 .",
    "one can obtain a closed black hole horizon by acting on the hyperbolic space @xmath35 by discrete subgroup of the isometric group of the hyperbolic space , resulting in a higher genus closed hypersurface . in four dimensions",
    ", the authors of @xcite have shown that a magnetic charged hyperbolic solution with @xmath36 and @xmath37 is supersymmetric . in that case",
    ", the metric function can be written as @xmath38 curiously this is an extremal black hole solution with vanishing hawking temperature , although the mass parameter @xmath36 in this solution .",
    "in fact , it is now well - known that there are so - called `` zero mass '' and `` negative mass '' black holes when the horizon is a hyperbolic surface .",
    "for example , when @xmath36 , the solution ( [ 2eq9 ] ) still has two black hole horizons @xmath39 provided @xmath40 in the four dimensional case .",
    "in fact , for the solution ( [ 2eq10 ] ) the black hole horizon is still present , even the mass parameter @xmath7 is negative down to @xmath41 where @xmath42 when @xmath43 , the solution describes an extremal black hole with vanishing hawking temperature .",
    "when @xmath44 , the singularity at @xmath12 becomes naked .",
    "therefore , for a given charge , @xmath45 given in ( [ 2eq13 ] ) is the smallest black hole horizon . despite the horizon structure , so far we have already seen the big difference between the ads rn solution ( [ 2eq1 ] ) and the hyperbolic charged ads solution ( [ 2eq9 ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to rewrite the hyperbolic black hole solution ( [ 2eq9 ] ) in terms of isotropic coordinates like in ( [ 2eq5 ] ) . defining @xmath46 we then have @xmath47 where @xmath48 in these coordinates",
    ", we can see that both signs ( positive and negative ) of @xmath28 are allowed to have black hole horizon .",
    "( 1 ) when @xmath49 , one has to have @xmath50 in order to keep the electric charge squared @xmath51 positive . ( 2 )",
    "when @xmath52 , instead one has @xmath53 .",
    "combining these two cases , we find that it is appropriate to introduce a parameter @xmath54 to parameterize the charge @xmath19 as @xmath55 one then has @xmath56 , the physical electric charge of the solution @xmath57 , and the corresponding electric potential @xmath58 note that when @xmath59 , the original singularity ar @xmath12 in the coordinates ( [ 2eq9 ] ) is moved to @xmath60 in the coordinates ( [ 2eq15 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the supersymmetric solution ( [ 2eq11 ] ) is achieved by taking @xmath61 in the coordinates ( [ 2eq15 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath7 and @xmath8 in ( [ 2eq10 ] ) are two integration constants which are independently variable in the range @xmath62 . in the isotropic coordinates ( [ 2eq15 ] ) , these two integration constants are mapped to @xmath63 and @xmath19 . from ( [ 2eq17 ] ) , however , one can see @xmath64 .",
    "namely , given a @xmath28 , one can not get an arbitrary large @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 and @xmath19 through ( [ 2eq14 ] ) does not cover the whole phase space given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , although in that case the expressions in ( [ 2eq16 ] ) have very similar forms as those ( [ 2eq6 ] ) of the ads rn black hole . to remedy this difficulty ,",
    "we find that the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath19 are good to do that . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath65 furthermore , instead of ( [ 2eq17 ] ) , we can introduce a parameter @xmath20 to parameterize the charge @xmath19 as @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the physical electric charge becomes @xmath68 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath7 and @xmath19 indeed cover the whole phase space as @xmath7 and @xmath8 in ( [ 2eq9 ] ) .    however , it turns out that it is more convenient to use the schwarzschild coordinates ( [ 2eq9 ] ) to discuss the thermodynamic properties and stability of the hyperbolic black hole . in terms of horizon radius @xmath69 , determined by @xmath70 , for the hyperbolic black hole",
    "( [ 2eq9 ] ) , the mass @xmath71 , hawking temperature @xmath72 , entropy @xmath73 and chemical potential @xmath74 which is conjugate to the electric charge @xmath8 are found to be @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the volume of the unit hyperbolic surface @xmath35 .",
    "it can be checked that these quantities obey the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xmath77 according to the ads / cft correspondence , the dual cft resides on the boundary of the ads space , whose metric can be determined from the bulk metric up to a conformal factor , @xmath78 the thermodynamics of the hyperbolic black hole can be mapped to that of the dual cft residing on ( [ 2eq25 ] ) . from these thermodynamic quantities ( [ 2eq20])-([2eq23 ] ) , we find that they satisfy the cardy - verlinde - like formula @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the non - extensive part of energy , namely the casimir energy , and @xmath81 is the energy of electromagnetic field outside the black hole .",
    "thus we generalize the discussion made for neutral hyperbolic black hole  @xcite to the r - charged case .",
    "next we discuss thermodynamic stability and phase structure of the solution . in the grand canonical ensemble",
    ", we will fix the chemical potential conjugate to the electric charge  @xcite .",
    "the euclidean action @xmath82 of the black hole solution has a relation to the gibbs free energy @xmath83 through @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "therefore to see the global stability of the hyperbolic black hole as a thermodynamic system , we can calculate the gibbs free energy , which is @xmath85 by definition , @xmath86 this gibbs free energy is always negative , the hyperbolic black hole phase is therefore globally preferred , and the hawking - page transition will not happen here . here",
    "some remarks are in order . although the relation @xmath87 between the gibbs free energy @xmath83 and the ( reduced ) euclidean action @xmath82 of black holes always holds ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , some subtleties exist , which concern the understanding of the euclidean action and free energy . when using the relation @xmath87 and the definition of free energy @xmath88 here , we have taken the vacuum with @xmath36 and @xmath89 as the reference background , as in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cases of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , there the vacuum backgrounds are pure ads spaces , not a black hole , the vacuum background of @xmath91 is a back hole with horizon @xmath92 , whose free energy is @xmath93 . subtracting this contribution ,",
    "the euclidean action should be understood as @xmath94 .",
    "the action is always negative provided @xmath95 , and is zero for the vacuum background . on the other hand ,",
    "if taking the extremal black hole ( [ 2eq12 ] ) as the reference background , as in @xcite , the black hole mass @xmath71 should be replaced by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 with @xmath98 given by ( [ 2eq12 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the gibbs free energy @xmath99 is always negative and approaches to zero for the extremal black hole .",
    "this is a natural generalization of the neutral hyperbolic black hole case discussed in @xcite .    in the grand canonical ensemble",
    ", the local stability condition of a thermodynamic system can be determined by the negative definiteness of the hessian matrix .",
    "the hessian matrix is arranged as the second derivatives of entropy with some extensive quantities . in our case ,",
    "the extensive quantities are the black hole mass and charge .",
    "this approach is equivalent to calculating the heat capacity with the fixed chemical potential .",
    "the heat capacity of the hyperbolic black hole with a fixed electric potential ( chemical potential ) @xmath74 is given by @xmath100 one immediately sees that the heat capacity is always positive , which indicates the stability of the black hole in all range of temperature .    in the canonical ensemble",
    ", we will fix the electric charge of the system  @xcite .",
    "in this case , the euclidean action of the solution will have a relation to the helmholtz free energy as @xmath101  @xcite , here @xmath102 .",
    "then for the present hyperbolic black holes , we have @xmath103 this indicates that when @xmath104 , where @xmath105 the free energy is positive ; otherwise it is negative .",
    "this implies that in the canonical ensemble with a fixed charge , when the temperature @xmath106 , where @xmath107 the black hole phase is not globally preferred , instead the thermal vacuum background is preferred . when @xmath108 , the hyperbolic black hole phase is globally preferred .",
    "across the temperature @xmath109 , a hawking - page phase transition happens . in fig .  1",
    ", we plot the physical charge squared versus horizon radius .",
    "the curve cross the horizon axe at @xmath110 denotes the extremal black holes with vanishing temperature .",
    "the region on the right side of the curve is physically allowed one with nonvanishing temperature .",
    "the other curve denotes the black hole solution having zero helmholtz free energy . on the left ( right )",
    "side of the curve the free energy is positive ( negative ) . from the figure one can see that the smallest horizon of black hole is @xmath111 .",
    "the region with negative @xmath51 should be excluded in the physical phase space .     versus the horizon radius @xmath112 for the case of @xmath113 . in the region on the common right of the two curves the black hole phase is globally stable in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the curve across the horizon axe at @xmath110 denotes the extremal black holes with vanishing temperature . ]    as in the grand canonical ensemble , the helmholtz free energy and then the euclidean action are also dependent of the choice of the reference background .",
    "it should be emphasized here that as we calculate the helmholtz free energy ( [ 2eq29 ] ) , the background is taken as the solution ( [ 2eq9 ] ) with @xmath114 , namely the so - called zero mass black hole .",
    "this might not be appropriate since the background has a vanishing electric charge , which does not satisfy the requirement of canonical ensemble .",
    "one of the choices as the background vacuums is to take the solution with @xmath36 and @xmath115 . in this case",
    ", the background is also a black hole spacetime .",
    "the other is to take the solution ( [ 2eq9 ] ) with mass @xmath43 in ( [ 2eq12 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the background is an extremal black hole . in either case",
    ", we have to recalculate the euclidean action in order to see the globally stability .",
    "however , we expect that the main conclusions remain valid .",
    "we do not to stress here the difference arising from different vacuum backgrounds . for related discussion see @xcite .    the heat capacity of black hole with a fixed electric charge is found to be @xmath116 this heat capacity , as the case in the grand canonical ensemble , is always positive . as a result ,",
    "the black hole is always locally thermodynamically stable .",
    "the r - charged black holes in d=5 , n=8 gauged supergravity have been found in @xcite as a special case ( stu model ) of the solutions of equations of motion of the d=5 , n=2 gauged supergravity ( see also @xcite ) . the black hole solution has the form @xmath118 where @xmath119 where @xmath120 can be @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 , corresponding to the foliating surfaces of transverse space being @xmath124 , @xmath125 or @xmath126 with unit metric @xmath127 , @xmath28 is the mass parameter and @xmath128 are three boost parameters . when @xmath129 or @xmath90 , the supersymmetric limit of the solution ( [ 3eq1 ] ) is obtained via taking @xmath130 and @xmath26 , while keeping @xmath131 finite .",
    "note that when @xmath90 , one has to rescale @xmath132 , and then send @xmath120 to zero , resulting in the gauge potential @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , the supersymmetric solution has vanishing gauge potential in the case of @xmath90 .",
    "the thermodynamics of cases @xmath129 and @xmath90 has been discussed in  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the case @xmath91 , namely the case where the horizon surface is a hyperbolic 3-space with constant negative curvature . in this case , the supersymmetric limit of the solution can not be obtained as the cases of @xmath129 and @xmath90 .",
    "so far it has not yet been clear whether the solution has the supersymmetric limit , or under what condition the solution is supersymmetric . in particular , let us note that in the solution ( [ 3eq1 ] ) , if one defines @xmath134 , the physical electric charges are @xmath135 when @xmath91 , one can see from ( [ 3eq2 ] ) that the electric potentials @xmath136 are pure imaginary if keeping @xmath128 real .",
    "this indicates that the parametrization used in ( [ 3eq2 ] ) and ( [ 3eq3 ] ) is not suitable for the case of @xmath91 .",

    "we discussed the thermodynamics , global and local stability of hyperbolic charged black holes in ads spaces .",
    "these black holes include hyperbolic rn black holes in arbitrary dimensions , hyperbolic charged black holes in d=5 , 4 and 7 dimensional gauged supergravities . in particular , we emphasized how to choose appropriate parameters to parameterize the solution in the isotropic coordinates so that the chosen parameters can cover the whole phase space .",
    "we found that the entropy of the hyperbolic rn black holes can be expressed by a cardy - verlinde - like formula , but the casimir energy is negative , which generalized the discussion for the neutral black holes to the charged case .",
    "it is easy to check that similar formula holds for the hyperbolic black holes in d=5 , 4 and 7 dimensional gauged supergravities .    for the hyperbolic rn black holes in arbitrary dimensions",
    ", we found that the gibbs free energy is always negative and heat capacity with a fixed gauge potential is always positive .",
    "this shows that in the grand canonical ensemble , the black hole is stable not only globally but also locally ; the hawking - page phase transition will not happen and black hole phase is dominant in the dual cfts . in the canonical ensemble , the heat capacity with a given electric charge is still positive , indicating the local stability of the black hole , but the helmholtz free energy can change its sign .",
    "this implies that a hawking - page phase transition will occur in the canonical ensemble .    for the hyperbolic black holes in d=5 , 4 and 7 dimensional gauged supergravities , the negative definiteness of gibbs free energy still persists , but the heat capacity with a given gauge potential could change its sign",
    "this implies that in the grand canonical ensemble , the hyperbolic black holes are globally stable , but not locally .",
    "the black hole phase is globally preferred and dominant in the dual cfts , but the black holes can not always be thermal equilibrium with an infinite thermal bath . in the canonical ensemble , there is always a region where the heat capacity with a given electric charge is negative , indicating the local instability of black holes . the helmholtz free energy for a single charge black holes can change its sign , except for the case of @xmath208 .",
    "this implies that a hawking - page phase transition will appear as the case of hyperbolic rn black holes .",
    "we noted that the helmholtz free energy is always negative for a single charged black hole in d=4 gauged supergravity .",
    "to understand this situation , it is helpful to recall the case of rotating m2-branes  @xcite , there in the case of a single rotation parameter , the free energy is also always negative , but it will change its sign for multiple rotation parameters . according to the relationship between the black hole solutions in d=4 gauged supergravity and the rotating m2-branes  @xcite ) ( also see @xcite ) , we expect that the helmholtz free energy will also change its sign for multiple charged hyperbolic black holes in d=4 gauged supergravity , which in fact is already predicted by ( [ 4eq9 ] ) .",
    "we point out here that when analyzing the stability and phase structure of a single charged black holes in d=5 , 4 and 7 gauged supergravities , we restricted ourselves to the case @xmath281 . as we discussed in the text , for the hyperbolic black holes , it is also possible to have @xmath282 , and in this case the solution still has a black hole structure .",
    "therefore it would be of interest to extend the discussion to the case of @xmath282 , and also to the case of multiple charges .",
    "further , the implication in the ads / cft correspondence is worth investigating  @xcite .",
    "when discussing the global stability of ads black holes , one has to calculate the euclidean action associated with the black hole .",
    "due to the infinite volume , the hilbert - einstein action for the black hole configuration is divergent . to get a finite euclidean action ,",
    "usually one can use the so - called background subtraction approach  @xcite , or the surface counterterm approach  @xcite . in the background subtraction approach",
    ", one has to choose an appropriate background : for asymptotically flat spaces , the minkowski space is a suitable one  @xcite , while for asymptotically ads spaces , the ads space is a suitable choice .",
    "but in some cases , for example , for the taub - nut and taub - bolt spaces , an appropriate vacuum background is difficult to choose . for those cases , the surface counterterm",
    "approach works very well  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have used the background substraction approach  @xcite .",
    "the chosen background is the ads vacuum solution with vanishing mass parameter and charge parameter .",
    "when calculating the gravitational mass of the hyperbolic black hole , we used the formula ( [ 3eq12 ] ) , which is derived from the euclidean action of black holes by subtracting the contribution of chosen vacuum background  @xcite . through such defined mass ,",
    "the resulting free energies associated with black holes have the relation to the euclidean action of black holes as @xmath283 and @xmath284 in the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble  @xcite , respectively . here the euclidean actions @xmath285 and @xmath286 are understood as the differences between the action of black holes and the one for the vacuum background ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the euclidean action and free energy have the same signs and then the global stability of ads black holes can be inferred from the behavior of free energy in the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble . for the equivalence , one may further refer to @xcite . for the hyperbolic ads black holes , the choice of the vacuum background is not unique as we pointed out before .",
    "one of the choices is to take the extremal black hole as the background ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "another natural choice is just to take the ads background without any excitation , namely black hole solutions with vanishing mass parameter ( we chose this background ) .",
    "the surface counterterm approach reveals that both the vacuum backgrounds might be suitable  @xcite .",
    "anyway , it is an interest issue to further study the dependence of global stability on the choice of vacuum background . in particular , it is of great importance to investigate whether or not there is a mechanism to uniquely determine a physical vacuum background via the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "finally we stress that when the heat capacities are negative , both the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble are not well - defined . in that case , one way to remedy this difficulty is to put the ads black hole in a finite cavity as the case of a schwarzschild black hole in a cavity ( see the paper by york in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we are also interested in thermodynamics and stability of dual cfts which reside on the boundary of ads space , so the cavity is put on the boundary of ads space . for large ads",
    "schwarzschild black holes  @xcite , the heat capacity is positive .",
    "therefore it is well - defined to discuss thermodynamics and stability of the black hole in the canonical ensemble . for small ads",
    "schwarzschild black holes , the heat capacity is negative .",
    "this of course implies that one can not use the canonical ensemble to study the small ads schwarzschild black hole .",
    "instead it is understood that this small black hole with negative heat capacity can not be in thermal equilibrium with an infinite heat bath , as the case of schwarzschild black hole . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , on the side of dual cfts , the phase of small black hole should be replaced by a thermal ads background , which has a positive heat capacity  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the situation is similar to the case of ads schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the hyperbolic charged black holes with heat capacity can not be in thermal equilibrium with an infinite heat bath surrounding the black hole .",
    "on the side of dual cfts , the corresponding phase is not controlled by these black holes with negative heat capacity , but by other gravity configurations , for example a thermal ads background with a fixed gauged potential .",
    "no doubt it is of interest to study thermodynamics and stability of these hyperbolic charged black holes in a finite cavity as the cases of charged ads black holes with positive constant curvature horizon  @xcite and with zero curvature horizon  @xcite . in particular , one should be quite interested in whether or not the thermodynamics of ads black hole in a cavity has a dual description on the side of dual cfts .",

    "<S> in ads space the black hole horizon can be a hypersurface with a positive , zero or negative constant curvature , resulting in different horizon topology . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamics and stability of black holes in ads spaces are quite different for different horizon curvatures . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study thermodynamics and stability of hyperbolic charged black holes with negative constant curvature horizon in the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they include hyperbolic reissner - nordstrm black holes in arbitrary dimensions and hyperbolic black holes in the d=5,4,7 gauged supergravities . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the associated gibbs free energies are always negative , which implies that these black hole solutions are globally stable and black hole phase is dominant in the grand canonical ensemble , but there is a region in the phase space where black hole is not locally thermodynamical stable with a negative heat capacity for a given gauge potential . in the canonical ensemble , the helmholtz free energies are not always negative and heat capacities with fixed electric charge are not always positive , which indicates that the hawking - page phase transition may happen and black holes are not always locally thermodynamical stable . </S>"
