    "in relativistic quantum mechanics , the calculation of the lowest lying bound states of a relativistic electron in a static coulomb potential is a classic problem . in some respects the perturbative solution provided by bethe@xcite is both simple and elegant and a standard example in many textbooks .",
    "early attempts to obtain the exact eigensolutions@xcite employed finite difference methods to solve the radial equations and obtain the eigenenergies .",
    "recently much effort has focused on the extension of basis set methods@xcite which have been applied with success in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "such matrix approximations of the dirac equation are usually obtained from a variational principle with the radial components approximated by a finite number of terms of a basis - set expansion .",
    "they often display pathological features such as the occurrence of unphysical spurious solutions@xcite and a failure to vary systematically with the basis - set size .",
    "these can for the most part be avoided if a resolvent operator rather than the dirac hamiltonian is used in the variational principle@xcite or by construction in explicit finite basis - set calculations@xcite .",
    "accurate numerical solutions have also recently been obtained using mapped fourier grid methods@xcite .",
    "spurious roots are still present in certain cases but can easily be identified@xcite .    for the coulomb potential with a coupling constant which is less than @xmath0 ,",
    "the dirac hamiltonian is self - adjoint in the first sobolev space@xcite .",
    "hence , as we shall show , its eigenpairs can be obtained iteratively in an absolutely convergent manner by means of the lanczos algorithm@xcite provided , of course , that only the positive energy eigensolutions are considered .",
    "although the lanczos algorithm is generally known for its application to conventional matrix eigenvalue problems , it can be used to solve eigenvalue problems of a self - adjoint operator which is bounded from below or above@xcite . in the former case",
    ", the matrix to be diagonalized is iteratively transformed into a tri - diagonal matrix and diagonalized after each iteration step to form a sequence of convergent eigenvalue solutions . in the latter case ,",
    "a tri - diagonal representation of the self - adjoint operator is constructed iteratively and diagonalized after each iteration step to form a sequence of convergent eigenvalue solutions .",
    "any spurious solutions which arise from the presence of continuum states can easily be identified in manner recently suggested@xcite .",
    "furthermore , many of the aforementioned problems are avoided if the following iterative scheme proposed by lanczos is employed .",
    "given the following eigenvalue problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a self - adjoint operator ( not necessarily bounded ) in a separable hilbert ( or sobolev ) space which possesses a number of eigenvalues @xmath3 ( not necessarily bounded from above ) which ascend from a minimal one @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore let @xmath5 be a normalized start vector having the properties that :    1 .",
    "@xmath6 exists for all non - negative integers k and 2 .",
    "@xmath7 satisfies the boundary conditions .",
    "the algorithm may then be stated as follows .",
    "calculate successively the vectors @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the iteration number .",
    "the lanczos method solves the eigenproblem by diagonalizing successively the operators @xmath11 the orthonormalized lanczos vectors @xmath12 fulfill the following recursion relations  @xcite @xmath13 where the lanczos polynomials @xmath14 are defined in the following way : @xmath15 @xmath16 \\hspace{5 mm } n=2,3,4,\\ldots,\\ ] ] with @xmath17 @xmath18    performing the diagonalizations in equation [ diag ] reduces to finding the roots of the following characteristic polynomial @xmath19 after each iteration step .    the generated sequence of eigenpairs ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) possess the following convergence properties  @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23    for a self - adjoint operator",
    "the lanczos algorithm can be implemented using _ _",
    "the exact bound states can be identified in the following manner@xcite . for those operators which possess a continuum as well as a point spectrum ,",
    "the space spanned by the bound state eigenfunctions is by itself certainly not complete and a suitable start vector should be composed only of components in the subspace spanned by the bound state eigenvectors .",
    "usually the start vector is chosen from a complete set of analytic functions which define a space @xmath24 .",
    "this space is in most cases not necessarily of the same dimension as the subspace spanned by the exact eigenvectors . on the other hand , if the lanczos algorithm is applied with this choice for the start vector , the eigenpairs obtained will correspond to those of the operator projected onto @xmath24 .",
    "a subset of these eigenstates must correspond to the exact eigenpairs of the unprojected hamiltonian operator since the exact eigenstates can be expanded in terms of the complete set of states which span @xmath24 .",
    "after each iteration , for each of the converging eigenpairs ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 ( where @xmath10 is the iteration number ) is calculated and a determination is made as to whether @xmath28 is converging toward zero or not . for the exact bound states of @xmath29 , @xmath28 must be identically zero while the other eigenstates states of the projected operator should converge to some non - zero positive value .",
    "provided sufficient iterations are performed , it should be possible , in this manner to identify uniquely the approximate eigenpairs which ultimately will converge to the exact bound states . since in the the lanczos algorithm",
    "the lowest - lying eigenpairs ( for an operator which possesses at most a lower bound ) usually converge the quickest@xcite one should be able to obtain good approximations to the lowest - lying eigenpairs .",
    "the coupled radial dirac equations for the upper and lower components g(r ) and f(r ) can be written as@xcite @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a quantum number analogous to the angular momentum quantum number @xmath33 in non - relativistic quantum mechanics . using @xmath34 and the coulomb potential for charge z , in relativistic units @xmath35",
    "the equations become @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fine structure constant .",
    "equations ( [ f ] ) and ( [ g ] ) can written in matrix notation @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 equation ( [ dham ] ) defines the eigenvalue problem which will be solved iteratively using the lanczos algorithm .",
    "to demonstrate that the the lanczos algorithm may be used to solve the dirac equations , a start vector was chosen using a slightly perturbed ground state solution derived by bethe@xcite with ( @xmath42 ) for an atom with @xmath43 .",
    "the start vector contained the following perturbed radial functions    @xmath44    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and a perturbation factor @xmath47 .",
    "note this choice for the start vector eliminates the possibility of obtaining negative energy eigensolutions@xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]    figure 1 shows the convergence for the ground state eigenvalue @xmath48 and a spurious solution @xmath49 .",
    "after 18 iterations , @xmath48 quickly converged to the exact ground state value of @xmath50 .",
    "the unphysical spurious solution converged to a value of 3.37003 . using a larger perturbation factor of @xmath51 , @xmath52 converged to @xmath53 to within two significant figures after 18 iterations .",
    "figure 2 shows the convergence of @xmath54 for the ground state solution and the spurious solution .",
    "@xmath54 iteratively converges to zero for the generated bound state solution and converges to a non - zero value for the spurious solution .",
    "the eigensolutions of the dirac hamiltonian have successfully been obtained using the the lanczos algorithm .",
    "an eigensolution can be identified by testing the convergence of @xmath54 for each generated eigenpair and by discarding generated solutions for which @xmath28 does not converge to zero .",
    "the convergence rate , needless to say , depends on the choice of the initial start vector .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out @xcite that the lanczos algorithm may be regarded as an application of the rayleigh - ritz method in which an orthonormalized set of krylov vectors have been used to define the successive subspaces in which the operator is diagonalized . this being the case , the convergence of @xmath28 should also be a suitable means of sorting out the approximate exact eigenstates from the spurious eigenstates if the rayleigh - ritz method is employed ."
