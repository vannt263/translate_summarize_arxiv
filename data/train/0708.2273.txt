    "we consider the uplink and downlink of a cellular multihop / mesh system ( e.g. , ieee 802.16j systems ) , with one base station , one fixed relay station and @xmath0 users .",
    "the role of the relay station is to enhance end - to - end link quality in terms of capacity , coverage and reliability @xcite , and its presence allows the base station to choose between ( i ) sending / receiving data directly to / from a given user , ( ii ) communicating over a two - hop route where the base station sends data to the relay station and the relay station forwards the data to the users in downlink , and vice versa for the uplink .",
    "we refer to this communication model as the _ multiuser relay channel _ ; which includes both the multiaccess relay channel ( uplink ) @xcite and broadcast relay channel ( downlink ) @xcite .    for fixed portable applications , where radio channels are slowly varying , multiple access methods based on opportunistic scheduling mechanisms take advantage of variations in users channel quality and allocate resources such that the user with the best channel quality is served at any given time or frequency ( could be subject to certain fairness and delay constraints ) .",
    "it has been shown by the pioneering works @xcite-@xcite that the sum capacity under such opportunistic scheduling algorithms increases with the number of users ; yielding _ multiuser diversity _",
    "gains by exploiting the time and frequency selectivity of wireless channels as well as the independent channel variations across users .",
    "* contributions : * while multiuser diversity concepts over traditional cellular systems is well understood , there are open issues on the design and analysis of resource allocation and opportunistic scheduling algorithms in relay - assisted cellular multihop networks .",
    "recently , low - complexity suboptimal resource allocation algorithms for cellular multihop networks were proposed in @xcite based on centralized scheduling using end - to - end link quality metrics , and were shown to simultaneously realize gains from both multiuser diversity and multihop relaying to enhance capacity and coverage , provided the availability of closed - loop transmission mechanisms .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the spectral efficiency of the opportunistic scheduling algorithms ( those proposed in @xcite as well as others ) over a multiuser relay channel in the asymptotic regime of large ( but finite ) number of users . in this regime , merely investigating the asymptotic capacity scaling as @xmath1 ( which was the standard approach in works on traditional cellular systems ) limits the scope of the probabilistic analysis and furthermore does not provide accurate insights on the large system behavior of the multiuser relay channel as the cellular backhaul link ( e.g. , link between the base station and relay station ) capacity does not scale with increasing number of users . instead , our approach involves using tools from extreme - value theory to approximate the _ distribution _ of spectral efficiency , which is tight provided that @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "in particular , we characterize the limiting distribution of spectral efficiency focusing on type i convergence and utilize it in investigating the large system behavior of the multiuser relay channel as a function of the number of users and physical channel signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) . our analysis results in very accurate formulas in the large ( but finite ) @xmath0 regime , provides insights on the role of multihop routing and spectrum reuse policies in leveraging the system - level performance of cellular systems in the presence of multiuser diversity gains from opportunistic scheduling and helps to identify the regimes and conditions in which relay - assisted multiuser communication provides a clear advantage over direct multiuser communication .",
    "extreme - value theory deals with the stochastic behavior and asymptotic distributions of extreme values , such as maxima , minima or order statistics in general . for instance , the extreme - value distributions for maxima are obtained as the limiting distributions of greatest values in random samples of increasing size , and are used as an approximation to model the maxima of long ( finite ) sequences of random variables . to obtain a non - degenerate limiting distribution , it is necessary to reduce the actual greatest value by applying a linear transformation ( or any transformation ) with normalizing coefficients which depend on the sample size .",
    "let @xmath2 be independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables drawn from a common cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath3 and denote the maximum of the sequence by @xmath4 .",
    "if there exist sequences of constants @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and some nondegenerate distribution function @xmath7 such that @xmath8 converges in distribution to @xmath7 as @xmath9 , then @xmath7 belongs to one of the three families of extreme - value distributions @xcite : frechet , weibull and gumbel distributions .",
    "the distribution function of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , determines the exact limiting distribution .",
    "hence , in the asymptotic regime of large @xmath12 , it is not necessary to know the detailed nature of @xmath11 in order to characterize the statistical behavior of @xmath13 ; and it is sufficient to know which limiting distribution ( if any ) @xmath11 gives rise to , i.e. to which one of the three domains of attraction @xmath11 belongs .    in @xcite-@xcite , von mises ( 1936 ) and gnedenko ( 1943 ) determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for weak convergence of @xmath13 to each of the three types of asymptotic limiting distributions , given the parent cdf @xmath11 corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "these conditions involve the tail behavior of @xmath14 as @xmath15 increases - for each type of limit . for the case",
    "in which @xmath3 has a density function @xmath16 ; the sufficient conditions are due to von mises @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall mainly be concerned with the case for which wireless fading results in received channel power distributions following the type i extreme - value distribution , where @xmath17 ; and this distribution function is known as the gumbel distribution . assuming absolutely continuous parent distributions @xmath11 with density @xmath18 , and that there exists a real number @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 such that , for all @xmath22 , @xmath18 has a negative derivative @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , we can use the following sufficient condition to determine if the parent distribution function @xmath3 belongs to the type i domain of attraction ( theorem 1.6.1 in @xcite ) : @xmath26 many fading distributions , e.g. rayleigh , rician , lognormal , could be given as examples leading to type i convergence .",
    "we can determine the normalizing constants @xmath27 and @xmath6 for type i convergence , by solving for @xmath6 in @xmath28 and setting @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the reciprocal hazard function @xmath31 .    defining the spectral efficiency function as @xmath32 , the following lemma extends the convergence results on maxima of @xmath33 to the maxima of spectral efficiencies by determining the constants necessary to preserve the same limiting extreme - value distribution .",

    "slow fading , each terminal in the multiuser relay channel is considered to obtain full channel state information regarding its transmission / reception links .    for the following analysis",
    ", we assume a time - division based ( half duplex ) relaying constraint for multi - hop routing protocols , which is due to the practical limitation that terminals can often not transmit and receive at the same time .",
    "in particular , we consider a two - phased decode - and - forward protocol ; where , for a given routing path between the base station and a given user , the relay station hears and fully decodes the transmitted data signal in the first phase and forwards its re - encoded version in the second phase .",
    "consider the scheduling problem such that @xmath0 users in the multiuser relay channel are to be assigned time - slots for transmission / reception over a common bandwidth .",

    "analogous to the max - sinr scheduler , which always serves the user with the best instantaneous rate at any given time / frequency resource , the max - route scheduling algorithm schedules the user with the highest end - to - end instantaneous rate .",
    "more specifically , the algorithm works as follows in the multiuser relay channel : ( i ) the base station compares the instantaneous rates over the direct links between itself and the users determined by @xmath45 and finds the best user .",
