    "recent measurements of the positron fraction in cosmic rays ( crs ) up to 100  gev by the pamela experiment  @xcite ( and of the sum of the electron plus positron fluxes by atic  @xcite and ppb - bets  @xcite ) have triggered a lot of interest on the possibility that there may be a dominant contribution to these terms from the annihilation or decay of dark matter ( dm ) particles , assumed to compose the dark halo of the milky way .",
    "indeed , the sharp raise in the positron fraction detected by pamela above 10  gev , confirming and super - exceeding previous hints of an anomaly  @xcite is a feature which can not be accommodated within the `` standard picture '' , with primary electrons accelerated in supernova remnants ( snrs ) and secondary positrons produced mainly from the interaction of primary cosmic - rays with the interstellar medium ( ism ) during propagation .",
    "it is instead suggestive of an extra primary source of positrons .",
    "pulsars are well - motivated candidates for this role , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility is the recent proposal that positrons ( and electrons ) are secondary products of hadronic interaction within the cosmic ray sources  @xcite .",
    "a contribution to the positron flux from dark matter was predicted long ago , see , e.g.  @xcite ; depending on the dark matter particle mass and on the shape of the electron / positron yield from annihilation or decay , the excess can be accommodated , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "a few puzzling issues arise however in connection to the dark matter interpretations : the required positron injection rate is fairly large , and , supposing the signal is due to annihilating particles , this points to pair annihilation rates much larger than the typical rates for thermal relic weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and/or to substructure enhancements which should be unrealistically large . also , it is to some extent surprising that a dark matter signal emerges clearly in the positron flux and it is still hiding in other indirect detection channels : for typical particle physics dark matter candidates ( where the `` typical '' here stands for the absence of a mechanism forcing the coupling of the dark matter particle to light leptons only ) signals to background ratios tend to be larger for the antiproton flux ( and even more , in perspective , for the antideuteron flux ) , and for the gamma - ray component produced via neutral pion decays .",
    "these features have guided recent work on both proposing new dark matter candidates , as well as setting constraints on the range of those that had been previously proposed .",
    "the issue of whether the standard cosmic ray picture could give a fair description of the electron / positron populations in the galaxy and of whether the dm component could give a sizable contribution had actually been risen a few times even before the recent refined measurements of their local fluxes . indeed , although there is a wide consensus in associating the observed multi - wavelength diffuse emission in the galaxy to cr interactions with the ism and magnetic field , cr spectra and propagation parameters tuned to describe the local picture can lead to an underestimation of the flux in some regions of the sky .",
    "high energy electrons emit radio to microwave photons via synchrotron radiation on the galactic magnetic fields and an excess in the innermost region of the galaxy has been claimed based on wmap data ( the so - called `` wmap haze '' ) when scaling the measured synchrotron radio intensities to the microwave band  @xcite . equally important is the inverse compton ( ic ) radiation component of high energy electrons on the starlight and microwave photon backgrounds .",
    "one of the models put forward to address the excess above 1  gev reported by egret in the observations of the diffuse gamma - ray emission of the galaxy  @xcite considered the possibility of a dominant contribution from ic on starlight of an electron population in the galaxy , on average , much larger than what is locally measured  @xcite ( `` optimized '' galprop model ) .",
    "recent preliminary data  @xcite from the fermi gamma - ray telescope ( formerly glast ) , however , do not seem to confirm the egret excess , with the level of the diffuse flux at high energy ( @xmath0 gev ) possibly consistent with a standard cosmic - ray setup and pointing to an instrumental effect in egret .",
    "other excesses , which are not commonly connected to a dm interpretation , has been reported in the x - ray emission at the galactic ridge  @xcite and in the tev @xmath1-ray emission measured by milagro  @xcite .",
    "the first relies on a quite complicate region , where simplified assumptions on the primary injection spectra and on the ism properties can break down",
    ". the contribution of unresolved source in the milagro data can be large  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we are mostly interested in a fair description of the local region , which involve only the diffuse emission at intermediate and high latitudes and longitudes .",
    "most attempts to insert the dark matter interpretation of the pamela data into a more global picture have involved either other species such as gamma - ray and antiproton yields , or other dark matter environments ( e.g. , the central region of the galaxy , or galactic satellites , instead of the local dark matter population which , in case the dark matter interpretation holds , would be most likely responsible for the measured positron flux ) . these kind of comparisons are inevitably model dependent .",
    "comparing yields is certainly very powerful when having a reference particle physics model in mind ; on the other hand , as already mentioned , one may just tune the dark matter candidate in such way that only light leptons are produced as detectable yields .",
    "radiative components are instead unavoidably associated to electron / positron yields : ic emission of a 100 gev to 1 tev electron on @xmath2 m starlight photons gives gamma - rays with energies peaked in about the range 50 gev to 5 tev ; the associated synchrotron emission on a  1  @xmath3 g magnetic field is peaked between 50 to 5000  ghz ( scaling linearly with the magnetic field ) .",
    "having normalized the electron / positron yield to the locally observed flux , the extrapolation for the radiative emission in the local portion of the galaxy and its neighborhood is fairly solid , since although it is true that there are uncertainties in the astrophysical model involved , such as the parameters in the cosmic - ray propagation model and the level of the stellar radiation and magnetic fields , these need to be in turn readjusted to the local measurements ( regarding the local electron flux as well as from ratios of secondaries to primaries in cosmic rays ) .",
    "extrapolations to , e.g. , the central region of the galaxy to compare , e.g. , with the wmap haze , are much more uncertain since they rely on the extrapolations for the astrophysical parameters ( with various kinds of degeneracies which can be involved ) as well as for the level of dark matter yield ( in connection , e.g. , with the dark matter density profile ) .",
    "we will study the dark matter contribution to galactic radiation seed at intermediate to large latitudes .",
    "the emission in such portion of the sky can actually probe the local environment and this test of the dm interpretation of the pamela excess can be thus considered self - consistent .",
    "we will analyze the dependence of the predicted signal on the uncertainties in the cosmic - ray propagation model .",
    "we will also sketch the differences with respect to the picture in which the source(s ) accounting for the pamela positron fraction is confined to the stellar disc rather than being spread to on a much larger vertical extension such as in case of the dark matter source . the reference to test",
    "experimentally our proposal will be the fermi gamma - ray telescope ( and , to a minor extent , the planck satellite  @xcite ) .",

    "we exploited a modified version of the galprop code  @xcite .",
    "the main modifications consist in introducing by input the spatial and spectral profiles of the dm source ( computed within the darksusypackage  @xcite ) , and in including the possibility of a spatially varying diffusion coefficient .    in the following ,",
    "we mainly consider one - zone models with isotropic diffusion , which can be regarded as the most extensively tested models of the recent past ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "a heavy wimp ( i.e. , @xmath29 few hundreds of gev ) with the same final state would actually induce an ic emission which is already strongly constrained by egret data  @xcite . for the dme benchmark scenario , we consider a wimp mass of 300  gev . a light(i.e . , @xmath30 gev ) wimp candidate annihilating into @xmath31 does not provide an explanation to the pamela data .",

    "the fit is performed adding the dark matter component to the background contribution from standard primary crs and the secondaries produced along propagation , computed in the same propagation model configuration .",
    "we allow the normalization and spectral index of both primary and secondary cr electrons to vary with respect to the cases reported in table 1 ( within the ranges @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , reflecting some uncertainties on their modelling . within these assumptions ,",
    "the models describing the dm component with the benchmark scenario dm@xmath23 can not reproduce simultaneously the two sets of data .",
    "they would require some exotic assumptions for the primary injection spectra .",

    "the theoretical curves do not reproduce the data in an extremely precise way only for what concerns the positron fraction at energies below 20 gev in the propagation models b1 and b3 .",
    "in such cases , the production of secondary positrons from primary cr is enhanced ( see fig .  [",

    "many explanations have been proposed to motivate such mismatch , like , e.g. , non thermal production mechanism , non - standard cosmology at the time of dm decoupling , and sommerfeld enhancement .    as we already mentioned , in the case of burkert dm profile , the differences in the spatial distribution of a signal scaling with @xmath43 , as in the wimp case , or with @xmath44 , as in the decaying dm case , are very mild .",

    "the absence of sharp features in the @xmath22 spectrum detected by fermi implies that the contribution of the source of positrons responsible for the pamela excess to the total @xmath22 local flux or to the associated diffuse emission , can be hardly singled out .",

    "<S> we propose to test the dark matter ( dm ) interpretation of the positron excess observed by the pamela cosmic - ray ( cr ) detector through the identification of a galactic diffuse gamma - ray component associated to dm - induced prompt and radiative emission . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to present an analysis based on minimal sets of assumptions and extrapolations with respect to locally testable or measurable quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the differences between the spatial and spectral features for the dm - induced components ( with an extended , possibly spherical , source function ) and those for the standard cr contribution ( with sources confined within the stellar disc ) , and propose to focus on intermediate and large latitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we address the dependence of the signal to background ratio on the model adopted to describe the propagation of charged crs in the galaxy , and find that , in general , the dm - induced signal can be detected by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope at energies above 100 gev . an observational result in agreement with the prediction from standard </S>",
    "<S> cr components only , would imply very strong constraints on the dm interpretation of the pamela excess . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if an excess in the diffuse emission above 100  gev is identified , the angular profile for such emission would allow for a clean disentanglement between the dm interpretation and astrophysical explanations proposed for the pamela excess . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare to the radiative diffuse emission at lower frequencies , sketching in particular the detection prospects at infrared frequencies with the planck satellite . </S>"
