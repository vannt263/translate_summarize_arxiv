    "efficient reconstruction of arbitrary sequences was introduced and investigated by levenshtein for combinatorial channels with errors of interest in coding theory such as substitutions , transpositions , deletions and insertions of symbols @xcite .",

    "as one can see , this problem is based on considering metric balls in a graph but it differs from traditional packing and covering problems in various ways .",

    "in this paper we continue these investigations and consider the reconstruction problem for permutations distorted by single transposition errors which consist of swapping 1 ) any two elements of a permutation ; 2 ) any two neighboring elements of a permutation ; and 3 ) the first and any other element of a permutation .",
