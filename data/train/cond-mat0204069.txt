    "<S> we comment on the article by fujimoto ( 1997 _ j. phys . </S>",
    "<S> a : math . gen . _ * 30 * 3779 ) where the exact equilibrium crystal shape ( ecs ) in the critical @xmath0-state potts model on the square lattice was calculated , and its equivalence with ecs in the ising model was established . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm these results , giving their alternative derivation applying the transformation properties of the one - particle dispersion relation in the six - vertex model . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown , that this dispersion relation is identical with that in the ising model on the square lattice .    in paper </S>",
    "<S> @xcite fujimoto determined the equilibrium crystal shape ( ecs ) in the @xmath0-state potts model on the square lattice at the first order transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> fujimoto claimed @xcite , that ecs is universal for a wide class of models , including the eight - vertex model @xcite , and the ising model on the square lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this universality is still not well understood .    </S>",
    "<S> the subject of the this comment is to show , that the one - particle spectrum in the six - vertex model ( which is known to be equivalent to the critical @xmath0-state potts model ) , and in the ising model on the square lattice are also the same . </S>",
    "<S> so , one can say , that the universality of ecs in different square - lattice models reflects the universality in the one - particle dispersion relation .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the @xmath0-state potts model ( @xmath1 ) on the square lattice , shown in figure [ lat ] . </S>",
    "<S> the sites of the potts lattice are depicted by open circles . </S>",
    "<S> the model hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 here we use the same notations as in @xcite , constants @xmath3 obey the critical temperature condition @xcite : @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath5 be a vector associated with a horizontal row of the potts lattice , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the two shift operators @xcite , shown schematically in figure [ lat ] . </S>",
    "<S> operator @xmath8 is the row - to - row transfer matrix of the potts model , and @xmath7 acts on the vector @xmath5 as @xmath9    it is well known , that the critical potts model is equivalent to the six - vertex model @xcite , and to the interaction round a face ( irf ) model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider for definiteness the associated six - vertex model . </S>",
    "<S> its sites are shown by full circles in figure [ lat ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can define two shift operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponding to translations along the directions @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that operator @xmath11 is the row - to - row transfer matrix of the six - vertex model . as it is clear from figure [ lat ] , </S>",
    "<S> these shift operators are related with @xmath14 by the equations @xmath15    consider operator @xmath16 , generating a one particle excitation from the ground state of the six - vertex model . </S>",
    "<S> this operator transforms under translations @xmath17 as @xmath18\\ , b(z ) , \\label{transf}\\\\   t_y \\ , b(z ) t_y^{-1 } & = &   \\exp [ -ip_y(z)]\\ , b(z ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where equations @xmath19 & = & \\sqrt{k}\\,\\,{\\rm sn}\\big(z-\\frac{i\\ , k'}{2}\\big ) , \\label{dis}\\\\ \\exp [ -i p_y ( z ) ] & \\equiv & \\exp[- \\omega ( z)]= \\sqrt{k } \\,\\,{\\rm sn}\\big(z-\\frac{2 i\\ , k u}{\\pi}\\big ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] define in the parametric form the dispersion relation @xmath20 of the one - particle excitations in the six - vertex model . here </S>",

    "<S> such calculations have been done by johnson , krinsky and mccoy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted , that equations ( [ dis ] ) describe also the one - particle excitation spectrum in the irf and the critical potts model @xcite . in the critical potts model these particles </S>",
    "<S> can be interpreted as the domain walls between an ordered and the disordered phases @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the latter is exactly the same , as the excitation spectrum in the ising model on the square lattice first obtained by onsager @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is in the meaning of parameters @xmath22 and @xmath39 . in the potts model </S>",
    "<S> they are given by equations ( [ k ] ) , ( [ rho ] ) , whereas in the ising model we had @xmath40^{-1 } ,   \\qquad   \\rho = \\sinh(2 k_2).\\label{is}\\ ] ]    substitution @xmath41 into the dispersion relation ( [ dp ] ) yields @xcite the equilibrium crystal shape ( ecs ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 denote the cartesian coordinates in the equilibrium crystal boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this shape is the same in the critical potts model @xcite , and in the ising model @xcite , if the temperature @xmath44 and the anisotropy ratio in the ising model are determined by ( [ is ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note , that the dispersion relation ( [ dp ] ) is relevant also to the simple gaussian model on the square lattice , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a real continuous order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> really , the two - point correlation function in this model can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 the dispersion relation is determined by the pole of the integrand in ( [ cor ] ) , i.e. by equation ( [ dp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the one - particle dispersion relation determines the angular dependence of the correlation length , the latter is the same in a wide class of square - lattice models including the ising , six - vertex , critical potts , and the simple gaussian model ( [ hamg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely , that the origin of this universality lies in the symmetry of the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , one could extrapolate this result to higher dimensions , speculating , for example , that the angular dependence of the correlation length in the three - dimensional ising model on the cubic lattice could be identical with that in the gaussian model like ( [ hamg ] ) on the same cubic lattice .    </S>",
