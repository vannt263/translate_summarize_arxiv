    "the relation between the car density and the car flow in road traffic systems is known under the name of _ fundamental diagram of traffic_. basically , fundamental diagrams are studied on one road ( a urban road , a highway segment or a circular ring )  @xcite . in this case of one road without crossing , one talks about fundamental diagram of one dimensional traffic ( 1d - traffic ) . however , many works on fundamental diagrams of 2d - traffic ( roads with crossings ) have appeared recently  @xcite .",
    "we are intereseted in this article by fundamental diagrams of 1d - traffic .",
    "we present an optimal control approach that permits to understand , approximate and interpret 1d - diagrams .",

    "the flow @xmath5 is linked to the density @xmath6 by the following functional relation : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average car - speed . to complete the dynamics given by the car conservation equation , lwr supposed the existence of a traffic behavior equation @xmath9 , either in the situation of time and space dependence , called the fundamental diagram of traffic .",
    "a well - known microscopic model is the car - following model  @xcite .",
    "the traffic is described on one road where it is supposed that vehicles follow their predecessors without overtaking and with a stimulation - response relation . in  @xcite , daganzo and",
    "gerolimins used a variational theory  @xcite to show the existence of a concave macroscopic fundamental diagram on a ring  .",
    "our results are very close to those given in  @xcite .",
    "however , the approaches , the models , and the exploitation of the results are very different .    in this article , the traffic on a circular road ( ring ) is described by dynamic programming equations ( dpe ) of optimal control problems . the average car flow is derived as the average cost per time unit of the optimal control problem considered . in addition , the average car flow is given in term of the average car density , giving thus the fundamental diagram of traffic .",

    "the dynamics tells simply that at each time , each car tries to move with a velocity @xmath11 under the constraint that it has to leave a safety distance @xmath6 with respect to the car ahead .",
    "the dynamics are given by a min - plus liear system  , and the average car flow is derived as the min - plus eigenvalue of this system .",
    "we extend the min - plus model by assuming that the desired car velocities are not constant but depend on the distances between successive cars .",
    "the first extension gives a model that describes the traffic by a dpe of a stochastic optimal control problem .",

    "the objective here is to approximate the diagram of figure  [ approx0 ] , in order interpret it and understand the traffic phases . to be able to approximate non concave parts of the diagram",

    "the fundamental traffic diagram derived using the stochastic optimal control model is @xmath240 .",
    "the diagram presents three phases . on figures  [ ph-1 ] ,",

    "the car positions on the circular ring are given at three different times in order to highlight the transitory regime .",
    "we note that during phase  1 and phase  3 , where @xmath244 and @xmath245 , the asymptotic car distributions on the road are not necessarily uniform , as shown on figure  [ ph-1 ] and figure  [ ph-3 ] .",
    "however , during phase  2 where @xmath246 , the asymptotic car distribution on the road is uniform , as obtained on figure  [ ph-2 ] .    in general , and for the three models presented above , we observed numerically the following  :    * for densities corresponding to the first segment of the fundamental diagram ( the segment starting with the point @xmath247 ) , which are in an interval of type @xmath248 $ ] , the asymptotic car distribution on the road can be non uniform . *",
    "if the last segment of the fundamental diagram ( the segment ending with @xmath249 ) is given by @xmath243 ( the only case corresponding to @xmath250 ) , then for the corresponding densities , which are in an interval of type @xmath251 $ ] , the asymptotic car distribution on the road can be non uniform .",
