    "the giant electric dipole resonance ( gdr ) in highly excited nuclei has been a subject of a considerable number of theoretical and experimental studies over the last three decades . at present , comprehensive experimental data on the dependence of the gdr width on temperature @xmath2 and angular momentum",
    "@xmath9 have been accumulated for a large number of medium and heavy - mass compound nuclei starting from potassium up to lead isotopes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the recent compilation ) .",
    "this systematic shows that the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the gdr increases significantly with @xmath2 at low and moderate @xmath2 , but seems to saturate at high @xmath2 , above @xmath10 4 - 5 mev . at a given value of @xmath2",
    ", the gdr width also increases with @xmath9 , but this increase is noticeable only starting from @xmath11 25 @xmath6 for copper and heavier isotopes .    a number of theoretical approaches has been proposed to describe the behavior of the gdr width as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath9 and two monographies have been published on this subject  @xcite . among the theoretical approaches to the study of the hot gdr , the phonon damping model ( pdm )",
    "@xcite offers a microscopic mechanism of the gdr damping via coupling of the gdr to non - collective particle - hole ( @xmath12 ) transitions , which exist already at @xmath8 0 , and particle - particle ( @xmath13 ) ones , which appear at @xmath14 0 because of the distortion of the fermi surface .",
    "the pdm is able to describe consistently both the increase in the gdr width at low and moderate @xmath2 as well as its saturation at high @xmath2 by using the single - particle energies , obtained in the woods - saxon potentials for protons and neutrons , and a set of 3 parameters , fixed at @xmath8 0 , which are the gdr energy before the coupling , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 coupling constants  @xcite . by including nonvanishing thermal superfluid pairing ,",
    "the pdm is also able to explain a nearly constant value of the gdr width at @xmath15 1 mev , found in the inelastic scattering of @xmath16o on @xmath17sn  @xcite . in a recent development ,",
    "the pdm was employed to calculate the ratio @xmath18 of the shear viscosity @xmath19 to the entropy density @xmath20 directly from the gdr photoabsorption cross sections in medium and heavy spherical nuclei at @xmath14 0  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained show that this ratio , which is called the specific shear viscosity hereafter , decreases with increasing @xmath2 to reach ( 1.3 @xmath21 4 ) kss at t = 5 mev .",
    "the quantity kss @xmath22 has been conjectured to be the lower bound for all fluids  @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of the pdm is that it does not include so far the dependence on angular momentum .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to remove this deficiency by extending the pdm to incorporate the effect of angular momentum to make the model capable to describe the dependence of the gdr width on both @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
    "the present extension will also be applied to examine the credibility of the preliminary analysis of the recent data  @xcite , according to which the gdr width extracted at @xmath10 4 mev and @xmath23 44 @xmath6 seems to be smaller than that measured at @xmath10 3 mev and @xmath23 41 @xmath6 in @xmath0mo .",

    "[ results ] . the article is summarized in the last section , where conclusions are drawn .",
    "the axis of quantization ( or the laboratory - frame @xmath24 axis ) of a spherical nucleus can always be chosen to coincide with the body - fixed axis .",
    "the latter is aligned with the direction of the total angular momentum within the quantum mechanical uncertainty  @xcite . as the result",
    ", the total angular momentum is completely determined by its @xmath24-projection @xmath3 alone .",
    "the rotation of a spherical nucleus ( as of a classical system ) about the @xmath24 axis is called noncollective or single - particle rotation . on the other hand , even for non - spherical nuclei , especially the axially symmetric ones , at high excitation energies and/or high @xmath2 , the values of angular momentum projection on the symmetry axis are mixed among the levels in the region of high level densities , which worsen the axial symmetry .",
    "the melting of shell structure will also eventually drive nuclei to their average spherical shape .",
    "the pdm is extended here to include the angular momentum effect for such noncolleticve rotation at finite @xmath2 .    for this purpose ,",
    "the hamiltonian of a spherical system , which is rotating about the symmetry @xmath24-axis , can be written in the following form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the pdm hamiltonian described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath27 represents the total angular momentum @xmath28 , which , in this case , coincides with its @xmath24-projection @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath29 where , for simplicity , the subscripts @xmath30 are used to denote the single - particle states @xmath31 in the deformed basis with the angular momentum @xmath30 and the positive single - particle spin projection @xmath32 , whereas the subscripts @xmath33 denote the time - reversal states @xmath34 ( @xmath35 0 ) . in the spherical basis",

    "thermal superfluid pairing plays the role of keeping the gdr width essentially unchanged at @xmath15 1 mev at @xmath62 0  @xcite .",
    "pairing has a negligible ( or no ) effect on the gdr width in the region of moderate ( high ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is the main focus of the present paper .",
    "therefore it is not included in the calculation of the gdr width here for simplicity .",

    "finally , it is worth mentioning that ref .",
    "@xcite proposed an evaporation width @xmath116 of the compound nucleus states to be added twice to the total gdr width ( see also p. 226",

    "once this width is incorporated in the calculations of the transition probabilities that define the amplitudes of the gdr photoabsorption cross section , it gives the natural width of 2@xmath116 , which is approximately the sum of the widths of the initial and final states . in heavy nuclei at high excitation energies , the width",

    "however , by using the lowest available value of @xmath198 0.6@xmath199 , extracted from the nuclear fission data , one finds the limiting values of @xmath3 to be around 46 and 55 @xmath6 , respectively , so that @xmath18 does not violate the lower bound conjecture up to @xmath8 5 mev , which is the temperature where the gdr and a nucleus are assumed to cease to exist .",

    "the theoretical strength functions have been normalized so that the peak of the strength function , obtained at ( @xmath8 3 mev , @xmath62 41 @xmath6 ) , matches the maximum of the corresponding experimental gdr strength function .",
    "the figure shows that , while the theoretical and experimental line shapes of the gdr agree fairly well at ( @xmath8 3 mev , @xmath62 41 @xmath6 ) with the fwhm @xmath205 11 mev , they strongly mismatch at ( @xmath8 4 mev , @xmath62 44 @xmath6 ) , where the experimental gdr peak becomes noticeably narrower with a width @xmath206 7.5 mev [ see also figs .",

    "the analysis of the numerical results show that the gdr width increases with @xmath3 at a given value @xmath2 for @xmath15 3 mev . at higher @xmath2 ,",
    "the gdr width approaches a saturation at @xmath7 60 @xmath6 for @xmath0mo and @xmath211 80 @xmath6 for @xmath1sn .",
    "however , the region of @xmath7 60 goes beyond the maximum value of @xmath3 , up to which the specific shear viscosity @xmath18 has the values not smaller than the kss lower bound conjecture for this quantity .",
    "this maximum value of @xmath3 is found to be equal to 46 and 55 @xmath6 for @xmath0mo and @xmath1sn , respectively , if the value @xmath212 0.6@xmath213 mev s @xmath132 for the shear viscosity at @xmath8 0 is used .",
    "a check by using the kss lower bound conjecture for the specific shear viscosity and the same @xmath212 0.6@xmath213 mev s @xmath132 also shows that the experimental data for the gdr line shape in @xmath0mo at @xmath8 4 mev and @xmath62 44 @xmath6  @xcite leads to a violation of the kss conjecture .",
