    "the concept of @xmath0 topological insulator was first introduced in a model for graphene @xcite , in the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic ( rashba ) spin - orbit interactions ( called hereafter , kane - mele model ) @xcite .",
    "the origin of @xmath0 symmetry lies naturally in the time reversal invariance of the underlying spin - orbit interactions , i.e. , in the existence of kramers pairs . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is represented by a so - called topological mass term ( of size @xmath3 , opening a spin - orbit gap @xmath4 ) , encoding quantized spin hall effect .",
    "the latter occurs when fermi energy is in the gap , and implies the existence of a pair of counter - propagating gapless states at the sample boundary with opposite spins , often dubbed as _",
    "edge modes @xcite .",
    "the idea of `` @xmath0 '' topological insulator stems from the observation that these helical edge modes are robust against weak perturbations , such as the extrinsic rashba spin - orbit interaction ( coupling strength : @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , non - trivial topological nature of a @xmath0 topological insulator is often attributed to the existence of such edge modes , protected by kramers degeneracy .",
    "this paper , on the contrary , highlights its _ bulk _ property .",
    "since real materials always have disorder , we investigate its transport property _ under doping _ using the framework of standard weak localization theory .    of course",
    ", the magnitude of spin - orbit interactions has always been questioned in graphene @xcite , leading to search for @xmath0 nature in a system of larger spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "the existence of helical edge modes was first experimentally shown in a two - dimensional hgte / cdte heterostructure @xcite .",
    "recall that in graphene two doubly degenerate dirac cones appear at @xmath1- and @xmath2- points in the first brillouin zone @xcite , in contrast to a single pair of dirac cones appearing at the @xmath6-point in hgte / cdte qauntum well .",
    "the first estimate of @xmath3 and @xmath5 in the original paper of kane and mele : @xmath72.4 k , and @xmath8 0.5 mk for a typical strength of perpendicular electric field @xmath9 50 v/300 nm , provides a favorable condition for @xmath0 non - trivial phase @xcite .",
    "this estimate was later shown to be too optimistic ( for the occurrence of @xmath0 phase ) due to the specific geometry of @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals in graphene . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the estimated value of @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) is much smaller ( larger ) than the original estimation of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath70.01 k , and @xmath8 0.13 k for the same electric field of @xmath9 50 v/300 nm . on the other hand",
    ", a recent first - principle calculation suggests that @xmath12-orbitals play a dominant role in the gap opening at @xmath1 and @xmath2 points @xcite . as a result",
    ", the actual value of @xmath3 might be somewhat intermediate between the previous estimates of @xcite and @xcite , namely @xmath70.28 k , @xmath8 0.23 k per v / nm .",
    "the concept of @xmath0-topological insulator has also been extended to three space dimensions @xcite . a recent spin - arpes study on bi@xmath13te@xmath14 reports on the experimental observation of a spin - helical two - dimensional surface state in such three - dimensional @xmath0-topological insulator @xcite .",
    "localization properties of the doped kane - mele @xmath0 insulator have been studied numerically @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite deduces a phase diagram in the @xmath15-plane ( @xmath16 : energy , @xmath17 : strength of disorder ) , in which a metallic domain appears in valence and conduction bands with a finite width in @xmath16 . as disorder",
    "is increased , these two extended domains in both bands approach to each other , and eventually merge and disappear .",
    "a more subtle issue is the nature of the metallic state next to the @xmath0 insulating phase .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that the system s @xmath0 symmetry leads to an unconventional symmetry class . however , an extensive study on the critical exponents @xcite has suggested that the weak anti - localization behavior of the doped @xmath0 insulator belongs to the conventional symplectic symmetry class . this paper addresses the basic mechanism how doped @xmath0 insulators acquire such unique localization properties . as a simple implementation of @xmath0-topological insulator",
    ", we consider kane - mele model , and in contrast to the numerical works of refs .",
    "@xcite , we restrict our study to the limit of weak disorder . on the other hand , we pay much attention to the existence of _ valleys _ in graphene , since localization properties are much influenced by the presence or absence of scattering across different valleys in the brillouin zone .",
    "the later is determined by the range of the impurity potential @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the kane - mele model is introduced in sec .",
    "then , we apply the standard diagrammatic approach to weak localization to the doped kane - mele model . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the case of vanishing rashba soi .",
    "particular attention will be paid to different types of the mass term , ( a ) and ( b ) , together with the presence / absence of @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering . here",
    ", we will focus on unitary behaviors , which appear as a consequence of a finite lifetime acquired by cooperons . breaking or",
    "preserved effective time reversal symmetry will be the main issue of this section .",
    "iv is devoted to study on the effects of rashba spin - orbit interaction . in the final section",
    ", we will summarize our results , and give interpretation to them in terms of the number of _ active _ species of effective spins @xcite .        in order to distinguish active and inactive spins ,",
    "we introduce ( pseudo ) trs operations @xmath18 , defined in the subspace @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "their explicit representations are , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is complex conjugation .",
    "@xmath27 represents the genuine trs operation .",
    "effective trs of the system is , therefore , determined by the transformation property of the mass term ( see table [ ptrs ] ) . when a mass term is odd against trs",
    ", the system shows the unitary behavior . if some ( pseudo or genuine ) trs exists in the system , its weak localization property is determined by the number @xmath28 of the activated spin degrees of freedom .",
    "one can verify @xmath29 if @xmath28 is even , whereas @xmath30 if @xmath28 is odd .",
    "the former ( latter ) corresponds to the orthogonal ( symplectic ) class in the random matrix theory @xcite , and leads to constructive ( destructive ) interference between two scattering processes transformed from one to the other by @xmath18 .",
    "the above symmetry arguments allow for a slight generalization of our localization phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ venn ] ) . recall that in sec . iv a , we have chosen the mass to be @xmath31 .",
    "results of this analysis are consistent with the symmetry consideration . in fig .",
    "[ venn ] , we further conjecture based on the symmetry consideration that a similar analysis for an ionic mass term @xmath32 leads to the absence of wl ( unitary behavior ) .",
    "thus , the four minus signs in table [ ptrs ] correspond to four unitary phases in fig .",
    "we also point out that in terms of symmetry , ripples plays the same role as the ionic mass .",
    "we mention that the results of our analyses summarized in table [ summary ] and fig .",
    "[ venn ] are also relevant to _ intrinsic _ single valley systems @xcite , such as the one realized in hgte / cdte quantum well @xcite . in the latter system , a single pair ( kramers pair ) of dirac cones appear , in contrast to graphene ( cf .",
    "graphene has two pairs of dirac cones ; they appear at @xmath1 and @xmath2 points ) .",
    "note that two dirac cones ( kramers pair , with real spin @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , described in the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , have the _ same _ sign for their mass term , implying ( superficially ) the ordinary ( ionic ) mass case in our language .",
    "however , they have also different chiralities , and by a simple linear transformation ( exchange of rows and columns ) , they can be mapped , and indeed corresponds to the topological mass case , studied in sec .",
    "iv a. our diagnosis ( see table [ summary ] , and also fig . [ venn ] ) suggests that the single - valley hgte / cdte system shows a crossover from unitary to orthogonal ( wl ) symmetry class , on activating the real spin degrees of freedom by a ( rashba - like ) off - diagonal interaction between real spin @xmath33 and @xmath34 sectors .",
    "what is then essential to the al behavior characteristic to the doped kane - mele model ?",
    "as can be guessed by the analysis relying on the number @xmath28 of active spin species , the combination of rashba interaction and the @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering makes @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "the al results even in the absence of the topological mass term , or even in the case of the ordinary mass term . in this sense ,",
    "the al is not a peculiar property of the doped @xmath0 insulator .",
    "the hallmark of the doped @xmath0 insulator becomes manifest in the absence of the rashba interaction .",
    "namely , the robustness of the unitary behavior against the range of the disorder potential is a fingerprint of topological mass term .",
    "the unitary behavior is closely related to the quantized spin hall effect in the undoped case .    finally , we comment on the role of the channel index @xmath36 which is a quantum number associated with a relative momentum of electrons before and after the scattering by an impurity .",
    "see eqs.([gamma012 ] ) and ( [ gamma_l ] ) for its definition . as we have already seen in the body of the paper , to identify the singular channel @xmath36 greatly helps to determine the weak localization property . in the case of long - range scatterers ,",
    "the two valleys are decoupled , and we can safely focus on , say , the @xmath1-valley . then , in sec .",
    "iii and iv , we have seen that the @xmath37 singularity appearing in the @xmath38(even ) channel leads to wl , whereas in the @xmath38(odd ) case , the same singularity leads to al , this situation is reversed in the presence of @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering : even @xmath36 leads to al and odd @xmath36 to wl according to table ii .",
    "the above selection rule on the singular channel @xmath36 is superficially dependent on the choice of the spin part of the wave function . in sec .",
    "ii and iii , we have chosen to use a single - valued two - component spinor for describing ab sub - lattice spin eigenstates , which were naturally extended to the single - valued four - component spinor in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction . if one choose a double - valued spinor instead of eq.([pseudo ] ) , pretending that the ab - sublattice spin realizes a real spin , then the selection rule is shifted by one .",
    "this shift , however , is the same for all cases in table ii .",
    "hence if we take the difference of @xmath36 relative to the graphene limit , for example , the wl or al behavior does not depend on the choice of the spin eigenstates .    as we have seen in secs .",
    "iii and iv , the value @xmath36 of singular channel does not change in the presence of @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering , the value of @xmath28 is , on the other hand , increased by one , in switching on the @xmath39 valley spin @xmath40 . since @xmath40 flip does not involve @xmath41 variables , the value @xmath36 of the singular channel remains the same .",
    "however , the nature of the channel does change by the @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering .",
    "namely , switching on of the valley spin appears as an additional minus sign in particle - particle ladders .    in conclusion",
    ", we have constructed a poor man s phase diagram of the doped and disordered kane - mele model . in order to characterize the @xmath0 nature of the model , we considered a doped case in contrast to the more familiar topological insulator phase .",
    "we also characterized the @xmath0 nature from its _ bulk _ properties , instead of its _ edge _ properties , to which the @xmath0 nature is often attributed .",
    "@xcite our analysis is restricted to the weak ( anti-)localization level , and can be used for constructing an effective @xmath42-model description of the same model .",
    "the basic mechanism discussed here will be also useful for the understanding of different types of topological insulators .",
    "the sign of topological mass is taken to be opposite to the original kane - mele opaper @xcite .",
    "this is only for later purpose of making phase diagrams more concise .",
    "physically , the sign of @xmath3 is determined by the the sign of next - nearest neighbor imaginary hopping , which is irrelvant to the localization properties .",
    "a similar circumstance occurs in the convetional analysis of weak anti - localization  la ref .",
    "when one considers scattering due to spin - orbit coupling , @xmath43 type isotropic term leads , as is well - known , to weak anti - localization . on the contrary , if one keeps only @xmath44 component , then the system is known to stay , in this case , orthogonal ( in our case the system stays unitary when @xmath45 ) ."
