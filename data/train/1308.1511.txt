    "quantum physics has revolutionised the study of information theory , as many information - processing tasks can be better accomplished using the non - classical weirdness of quantum systems .",
    "the most famous example is the exponential speed - up for certain computing tasks that could ( in principle ) be obtained for a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "another example is the in - principle perfect security offered by quantum cryptography @xcite . from a fundamental perspective , it is natural to ask : what aspect of quantum systems or quantum dynamics leads to the information - processing advantage ?",
    "this is the well - known _ quantum advantage _ question .",
    "an enormous amount of research has gone into studying the role of _ quantum correlations _",
    ", such as entanglement @xcite and discord @xcite , in determining the quantum advantage .",
    "while quantum correlations are indeed important and useful , they are not necessarily the whole story , since there are non - classical aspects of _ unipartite _ quantum systems .",
    "one such notion is that of _ complementarity _ , the idea that certain pairs of observables can not simultaneously be known , famously stated in heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty principle provided inspiration for the original proposal for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , and recently it was explicitly used to prove the security of qkd @xcite .",
    "while it is common to think of entanglement or discord as a resource , it is much less common to think of complementarity as a resource , perhaps because the notion seems somewhat vague .",
    "however , complementarity is naturally quantified in uncertainty relations , which are quantitative bounds on one s knowledge of ( typically ) pairs of observables .",
    "one of the most famous uncertainty relations is that of maassen and uffink @xcite , where they consider two orthonormal bases @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the hilbert space @xmath4 of quantum system @xmath5 ( w.l.o.g .",
    "we take @xmath1 to be the standard basis ) . for any state",
    "@xmath6 the uncertainties , quantified by the shannon entropies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are bounded by @xmath9 where @xmath10 quantifies the complementarity between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 observables .",
    "the complementarity factor @xmath11 appears in other uncertainty relations @xcite , including strong versions that have application for qkd security analysis @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the role that complementarity plays in a simple , well - known communication task called superdense coding ( sdc ) @xcite . in studying the quantum advantage it is natural to seek out the simplest imaginable tasks for which quantum systems provide an advantage over classical systems .",
    "indeed sdc is extremely simple : by sending a _ single _ qubit to bob , alice can convey _ two _ classical bits of information . in the ideal case , alice and",
    "bob preshare a maximally entangled state ( mes ) @xmath12 for two qubits ,",
    "alice encodes her messages by applying a pauli operator unitary @xmath13 chosen from the set @xmath14 to system @xmath5 resulting in the state @xmath15 , she sends @xmath5 to bob , who can then perfectly distinguish between the four possible states by doing a measurement in the bell basis .",
    "this simple example dramatically illustrates the quantum advantage : with a classical strategy alice can at best send _",
    "one _ bit of information for each two - level system that she sends , while the quantum strategy gives _",
    "so what is behind the quantum advantage in sdc ?",
    "the typical answer is entanglement , and indeed there would be no advantage over a classical strategy if alice and bob s preshared state was disentangled @xcite .",
    "but entanglement is not the only nonclassical aspect of sdc ; there is also the fact that the local unitaries that alice may implement are non - commuting .",
    "in fact , we show that if alice s set of local unitaries is commutative , then she can not obtain any advantage over a classical strategy , regardless of whether the preshared state with bob is entangled .",
    "it seems that both entanglement _ and _ complementarity are important for sdc .",
    "we further attempt to capture the importance of complementarity in sdc by making an analogy to uncertainty relations .",
    "notice that alice s set of pauli operator unitaries can be written as @xmath16 where both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are either 0 or 1 , and the phase factor relating @xmath19 to @xmath20 has no consequence .",
    "writing the unitaries like this emphasizes that the non - commutativity of the unitaries is linked to the fact that there are two complementary bases , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "suppose we allow the angle between these two bases to vary , possibly decreasing the complementarity of the two bases , how does this affect the capacity of sdc ?",
    "the extreme case in which the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bases are fully complementary allows her to send two bits , while the other extreme corresponds to @xmath21 so alice s unitaries are commuting and hence she can send no more than one bit . for the intermediate cases , we find - in our main result - a fascinating connection between the sdc capacity and uncertainty relations such as .",
    "alice s classical capacity @xmath22 as a function of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bases is given by : @xmath23 \\text {   bits}\\\\ \\label{eqn3}&{\\geqslant}[1 + \\log_2 ( 1/c ) ] \\text {   bits},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the binary entropy and the @xmath11 here is _ precisely the same factor appearing in the uncertainty relation _ . note that the extreme cases of @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively give two bits and one bit for our capacity formula .",
    "we state the lower bound here because we can only find a simple equation like in some special cases of high symmetry , whereas were shall generalise the bound in to the most general case of noisy resources ( discussed below ) .",
    "operationally , one may think of the partial complementarity case as a scenario where alice attempts to do the sdc encoding with her four unitaries but her hadamard gate @xmath27 , which allows her to transform from the standard basis to the @xmath0 basis , is faulty , and she implements @xmath28 instead of the usual @xmath29 .",

    "the use of entanglement together with non - commuting unitary encodings allows alice to effectively expand the size of the sample space , from @xmath79 to @xmath83 . or let us state it in the opposite way . if alice tried to implement sdc in a classical ( i.e. , high decoherence ) setting , then decoherence would effectively reduce the size of the sample space , from @xmath83 down to @xmath79 , such that holds .",

    "so the bound in approaches that in as the complementarity grows .",

    "the results presented here shed light on the quantum advantage in superdense coding .",
    "while it was well - known that entanglement is crucial for sdc , we showed in prop .",
    "[ prop13454 ] that _ complementarity _ is also crucial for sdc . without non - commuting unitaries",
    ", alice can communicate no more than 1 dit of information for each qudit that she sends , even if she has preshared entanglement with bob . in this sense",
    ", one could experimentally use sdc as a complementarity witness : if alice can communicate more than 1 dit per qudit sent , then her encodings exhibit complementarity .",
    "we then presented quantitative relations between the amount of complementarity and the sdc capacity , in sec .",
    "[ sct3uncrel ] . to formulate these relations",
    ", we supposed that alice uses pauli products to encode her messages , but her pauli operators may be  imperfect \" , i.e. , the unitary gate @xmath27 that relates the @xmath0 pauli operator to the @xmath1 pauli operator may not be a perfect hadamard .",
    "we quantified the complementarity of alice s encodings by considering the overlap matrix @xmath102 .",
    "our simplest and perhaps most beautiful result was the exact expression for the sdc capacity , given by @xmath170 , when alice and bob preshare a mes and communicate over of a noiseless channel .",
    "thus we found that the sdc capacity depends on every single element of the matrix @xmath94 , is symmetric under interchanging any matrix elements of @xmath94 , and is given by simply taking the shannon entropy of this matrix .",
    "this formula for the sdc capacity allowed us to argue , in prop .",
    "[ thm56aaswbas ] , that the capacity is 2 dits iff the encodings have fully complementarity , and is 1 dit iff the encodings have zero complementarity .",
    "we then extended this result to the case where the resources have noise , albeit a symmetric sort of noise . allowing the preshared state to be of the werner type and the channel to",
    "be depolarising , we explicitly solved for the sdc capacity as a function of the overlap matrix in thm .",
    "[ thmwerdep1 ] .",
    "an important observation in proving this was to show that encoding with equal probabilities is the optimal strategy in this case .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fgr2 ] for different values of noise showed that the dependence on complementarity is less dramatic when the preshared entanglement is lower , _ and vice - versa _ , suggesting that complementarity and entanglement  work together \" to raise the sdc capacity . in sec .",
    "[ sct38 ] we considered more general resources , and although we could not give an equation relating capacity to complementarity in the general case , we obtained lower bounds on the capacity in terms of @xmath98 .",
    "theorem  [ thm58 ] gave such a bound in the most general case of arbitrary resources .",
    "the overlap matrix appearing in our results is the same one appearing in well - known entropic uncertainty relations .",
    "in particular @xmath11 appears in the maassen - uffink uncertainty relation and others @xcite .",
    "thus , our equations and bounds for the sdc capacity resemble uncertainty relations .",
    "( since many of our relations take into account more elements of the matrix @xmath94 , they _ especially _ resemble information exclusion relations @xcite . ) from the perspective of fundamental physics , it seems fascinating that the notion of complementarity , that observables come in pairs that exhibit a knowledge tradeoff , can be stated in a completely different way from heisenberg s original view @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that _ the complementarity of two observables is quantitatively captured by their usefulness for superdense coding_. this is a conceptually new paradigm for capturing the notion of complementarity .",
    "now let us consider ways in which our results could be extended .",
    "while we have studied the capacity in the asymptotic limit of infinite usages , it should be possible to derive bounds for one - shot dense coding similar to the ones we have given here .",
    "this is because the one - shot classical capacity is related to a relative entropy function @xcite with some properties similar to von neumann relative entropy @xcite , namely the data - processing inequality .",
    "we have focused on complementarity used by alice in the encoding , but it could be interesting to consider bob s decoding . in the ideal case considered in the introduction where alice and bob preshare a mes of two qubits , bob measures in the bell basis to decode alice s message .",
    "a bell basis measurement can be viewed as requiring complementarity , so it could be interesting to explore restrictions on bob s decoding .",
    "finally , our results seem to suggest that complementarity is a resource , consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite , and also with other references @xcite that discussed a possibly related resource called interference .",
    "this idea remains somewhat vague when one considers , for example , how well developed the resource theory is for entanglement @xcite .",
    "is it possible to formulate a resource theory for complementarity ?",
    "perhaps the idea would be that hadamard gates are the resource , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and one could have a notion of a partial hadamard analogous to the notion of partial entanglement . ultimately this could lead us closer to answering the widely debated question : what gives the quantum advantage ?",
