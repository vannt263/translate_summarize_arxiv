    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) is carrying out an imaging and spectroscopic ccd survey of the sky at high galactic latitudes , using a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory in south - east new mexico .",
    "the telescope saw first light in may 1998 , and following an extensive period of commissioning , formal survey operations began in april 2000 .",
    "the resulting data have been distributed to the public via web interfaces accessible from the sdss public web site , and have been described in a series of papers :    * the early data release , including data taken during commissioning , stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter edr paper ) , consisting of 462 deg@xmath0 of imaging data and spectra of 54,000 objects . *",
    "the first data release , abazajian et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter dr1 paper ) , consisting of imaging data over 2099 square degrees and spectra of 186,240 objects . * the second data release , abazajian et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter dr2 paper ) , consisting of imaging data over 3324 square degrees and spectra of 367,360 objects .",
    "these data allow investigations in all areas of optical astronomy , from asteroids to quasars . among the papers which have appeared since the second data release are studies of the stellar masses of galaxies ( brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2004 ) , measurements of the dark matter power spectrum from the ly @xmath1 forest ( mcdonald et al .",
    "2004 ) and corresponding constraints on cosmological parameters ( seljak et al .",
    "2004 ) ; studies of quasars ( lacy et al .",
    "2004 ) and galaxies ( hogg et al .",
    "2004 ) by cross - correlating sdss data with the spitzer first - look survey ; the discovery of new structures in the halo of m31 ( zucker et al .",
    "2004ab ) ; measurements of the detailed shape of the galaxy correlation function and relation to halo occupation models ( zehavi et al .",
    "2004 ) ; and studies of populations of stars at the bottom of the hr diagram ( west et al .  2004 ; knapp et al.2004 ) .",
    "the sdss imaging data are taken on photometric moonless nights ( with photometricity determined by an auxiliary telescope ; hogg et al .",
    "2001 ) of good seeing with a wide - field imaging camera operating in drift - scan mode ( gunn et al .",
    "six parallel _ scanlines _ on the sky , each @xmath2 wide , are observed by each of the columns of ccds .",
    "each of the five rows of the ccds in the camera is fronted by a different filter , thus each scanline is observed in five filters , denoted ( in order of observation ) @xmath3 ( fukugita et al .  1996 ; gunn et al .  1998 ;",
    "edr paper ) .",
    "the imaging data are processed by automated software pipelines that measure the properties of all detected objects ( lupton et al .",
    "2001 ) , and perform astrometric ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ) and photometric calibration , the latter to a set of standard stars observed with the photometric telescope ( smith et al .",
    "the resulting object catalogs are used to select targets for spectroscopy , including the `` main '' sample of galaxies , magnitude - limited to @xmath4 ( strauss et al.2002 ) , a sample of luminous red ellipticals to @xmath5 ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ; dr2 paper ) , quasar candidates selected by their colors to @xmath6 ( for @xmath7 candidates ) and @xmath8 ( for higher - redshift candidates ) ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) , as well as a host of additional targets , including optical counterparts to rosat x - ray sources ( anderson et al .",
    "2003 ) , unusual stars , and calibration observations ( edr paper ) .",
    "all magnitude limits here are corrected for galactic extinction following schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the list of spectroscopic targets is distributed among a series of spectroscopic _",
    "tiles _ of @xmath9 diameter ( blanton et al .  2003 ) to maximize observing efficiency .",
    "each tile then forms the design for a spectroscopic plate : holes are drilled in aluminum plates corresponding to the position of each object for which spectra will be measured . at the telescope , optical fibers feeding a pair of double spectrographs are plugged into each plate ; the spectroscopic observations , carried out under conditions not pristine enough for imaging , are typically 45 minutes per plate .",
    "the spectra are wavelength- and flux - calibrated , and run through an automatic pipeline to classify them and determine redshifts ( edr paper ) .",
    "the previous data release papers describe the quality of the data ; the basic attributes of the data are given in table  [ tab : characteristics ] .",
    "the sdss third data release ( dr3 ) consists of all survey - quality data taken through june 2003 as part of the main sdss survey .",
    "the footprints of the imaging and spectroscopic data are shown in figure  [ fig : skydist ] .",
    "the spectroscopic footprint is smaller : because spectroscopic targets are chosen from the imaging data , the spectroscopy always lags the imaging . as with previous data releases ,",
    "dr3 does _ not _ include repeat imaging scans ( mostly on the celestial equator in the southern galactic cap ; see figure  [ fig : skydist ] ) , repeat observations of spectroscopic plates that have been observed more than once , or imaging or spectroscopic data taken significantly outside the ellipse of the main survey footprint ( as described in york et al .   2000 ) .",
    "however , six spectroscopic plates , and thirty - four square degrees of imaging data in the northern galactic cap in dr3 lie just outside this ellipse . as in previous data releases",
    ", dr3 does include imaging data that overlap between adjacent runs .",
    "the sdss has taken a considerable amount of imaging data at low galactic latitudes outside the survey footprint ; the subset of these data taken before summer 2003 have been made publically available in a release separate from dr3 , and is described by finkbeiner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "as the survey has progressed , we have steadily improved the software used to process the imaging and spectroscopic data .",
    "these changes are described in the dr1 and dr2 papers , and at the public sdss web site .",
    "each subsequent release has incorporated all the data included in the previous release , necessitating a reprocessing of those data . for dr3 , however",
    ", we have made _ no _ changes in the processing software , and therefore the dr2 subset of the dr3 data are _ identical _ to the data already made public in 2004 march .",
    "there is one exception to this statement , namely that we have updated some incorrect spectral classifications in dr3 .",
    "we have also added several new auxiliary tables to the sdss catalog archive server ( cas ) which will be useful for those using sdss data .",
    "the archive introduction page in the help menu on the cas website describes the cas data model .",
    "it has a new link at the top for release - specific notes .",
    "we have visually inspected the spectra of all objects which remained unclassified ( spectral class unknown ) , and have updated the classification and redshift where appropriate .",
    "many of these objects are of low signal - to - noise ratio , or are unusual objects of various types , especially unusual quasars ( see hall et al .",
    "there are 477 objects whose classifications were updated in this effort , including 377 objects included in dr2 .",
    "we have added a separate database table that includes stellar b , v , r , and i kron - cousins photometry with accuracy of 0.02 mag or better from stetson ( 2000 ) , as downloaded from the canadian astronomy data centre photometric standards website .",
    "these data , when cross - matched with sdss , allow sdss photometry of stars to be compared with an external catalog .",
    "after fitting for the conversion between the @xmath10 sdss photometric system to the kron - cousins photometry used by stetson , we find the residuals shown in figure  [ fig : stetson ] ; the rms scatter is of order 2.5% in each band .",
    "there is some evidence that this scatter is dominated by errors in the photometric calibration of the sdss .",
    "further details will be given in holtzman et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "we have also included data from the third reference catalog of galaxies ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , again to allow cross - reference to sdss data .",
    "please see the cas archive introduction page on the skyserver website s help page for more information about the stetson and rc3 databases .      as part of quality assurance of the sdss data , each of the @xmath11 @xmath12 fields within dr3",
    "is assigned a quality flag , fieldqall , which is now made available in a separate table , entitled _ runqa _ in both the catalog archive server and data archive server .",
    "this flag is based on five attributes :    * the seeing in the @xmath13 band . *",
    "the mean offset between the @xmath14 aperture magnitude , and the point spread function ( psf ) magnitude for bright stars on the frame .",
    "the accuracy of the results of the photometric pipeline are critically dependent on a correct model for the psf , and the aperture minus psf magnitude is an excellent diagnostic for problems in the psf determination .",
    "this magnitude difference typically is large under conditions in which the seeing is varying rapidly ( see the discussion in ivezi et al .",
    "* systematic offsets of the stellar locus in color space , and/or increased width of the stellar locus . as described in fan ( 1999 ) , finlator et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , helmi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and many other papers , stars in the sdss photometric system follow a narrow locus in color - color diagrams .",
    "one can define a series of four _ principal colors _ from fits to the stellar locus , which are linear transformations of the sdss magnitudes which empirically are essentially constant over the sky ( after correcting for foreground reddening following schlegel et al .",
    "that is , systematic deviations of these principal colors as small as 1% could indicate problems in the data .",
    "these principal colors are defined as : * * the @xmath15 color , @xmath16 , which is perpendicular to the stellar locus in the @xmath17 diagram . * * the @xmath18 color , @xmath19 , which is perpendicular to the blue branch of the stellar locus in the @xmath20 diagram . * * the @xmath21 color , @xmath22 , which is perpendicular to the red branch of the stellar locus in the @xmath23 diagram . * * the @xmath24 color , @xmath25 , which is perpendicular to the stellar locus in the @xmath26 diagram .",
    "+ these principal colors are measured directly from the stars in running bins four fields wide .",
    "deviations from the global mean principal colors are indications of photometric errors , especially those due to photometric calibration .",
    "scatter around the principal colors within a single bin ( i.e. , a broad stellar locus ) is another indication of poor data . for the present",
    ", we use the so - called @xmath15 color in our overall quality assessment of each field ( although statistics on all four colors are available in the _ runqa _ table ) . in future work",
    ", we plan to incorporate information about all four colors in the field quality .",
    "* finally , the processing of the data itself can indicate problems . as described in  4.6 of the edr paper (  4.6 ) , a field",
    "can be given a so - called operational database quality of bad , missing , or hole , often because the data corresponding to the field is particularly poor , or the photometric pipeline timed out on processing it ( e.g. , because of the presence of a naked - eye star in the field ) .",
    "based on these quantities , we assign fieldqall for each field , as follows :    * by default , the field in question is assigned fieldqall= acceptable ( listed in the _ runqa _ table numerically as * 1 * ) . *",
    "if the absolute value of the median psf - aperture difference is greater than 0.05 magnitudes in any of the five bands , or if the absolute value of the @xmath15 color median is larger than 0.05 magnitudes , or if the @xmath15 color distribution width is 2.5 times larger than its median value for the whole run , or if the @xmath13-band seeing is worse than 3 arcseconds , or if the operational database quality is bad , missing , or hole , the field in question is downgraded to bad ( listed as * 0 * ) . * if the absolute median psf - aperture difference is smaller than 0.03 magnitudes in all five bands , and if the absolute value of the @xmath15 color median is smaller than 0.03 mag , and if the @xmath15 color distribution width is smaller than twice its median value for the whole run , the field in question is upgraded to good ( listed as * 2 * ) . * if the median psf - aperture difference is smaller than 0.02 magnitudes in all five bands , and if the absolute value of the @xmath15 color median is smaller than 0.02 mag , and if the @xmath15 color distribution width is smaller than 1.5 times its median value for the whole run , and the @xmath13-band seeing is better than 2 arcseconds , the field in question is upgraded to excellent ( listed as * 3 * ) .    in the dr3 , 58% of fields are excellent , 26% are good , 13% are acceptable , and only 3% are bad .",
    "examples of how to use the runqa table can be found by selecting this table in the cas schema browser on the skyserver website .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that doing statistical analyses off the sdss spectroscopic data requires detailed understanding of the completeness of any particular sample . with this in mind , we have undertaken various efforts to compile complete samples of various subsets of spectroscopic objects , including quasars ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "2003 ) , white dwarfs ( kleinman et al .  2004 ) , asteroids ( ivezi et al .",
    "2002 ) , clusters of galaxies ( miller et al .",
    "2004 ) and galaxies themselves ( blanton et al .  2004 ; this latter includes detailed information on the geometry of the sample ) , as well as photometric samples of quasars ( richards et al .",
    "we are actively preparing updated samples for dr3 .",
    "our next data release after dr3 will consist of data taken through july 2004 ; it will occur in july 2005 .",
    "sdss survey operations will end at about that time , and a final data release ( dr5 ) is planned for early 2006 . as figure  [ fig : skydist ] implies , there will still be a substantial gap between the northern and southern pieces of the sky covered in the north galactic cap ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , and we are actively seeking funds to extend operations beyond summer 2005 to fill the gap .",
