    "because of the large mass of the top quark near to the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale , the study of top - quark properties can open a unique window to new physics @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) framework ,",
    "the flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes are forbidden at tree level and are suppressed at the level of quantum loop corrections due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite . whereas the sm predicts tiny branching ratios of top - quark fcnc decays to a light up - type quark and a gauge or higgs boson @xcite [ br@xmath9 , where @xmath10 = up or charm quark and @xmath11 = photon ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 boson ( @xmath13 ) , gluon ( @xmath14 ) , or higgs boson ( @xmath15 ) ] , various extensions of the sm predict a huge enhancement for the branching ratios of these decays by relaxing the gim suppression and introducing new particles that contribute in the quantum loops @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the observation of any sign from top - quark fcnc processes will give evidence of physics beyond the sm .",

    "in this section , we study the sensitivity of future searches for fcnc interactions through same - sign top - quark production . in fig .",
    "[ com ] , the cross sections for @xmath20 production induced by flavour - violating top-@xmath13 , top - photon , top - gluon , and top - higgs couplings normalized to the corresponding top - quark decay branching ratios are shown as a function of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "[ com ] that for a given value of @xmath21 fcnc branching ratios , the anomalous @xmath22 coupling is the most sensitive coupling , followed by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in the shown range of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "the cross sections of all signal channels increase by increasing the center of mass energy and the cross section due to the fact that tqh increases less than the others .",
    "the same - sign analysis used to constrain the top - quark fcnc interactions has three sources of sm background :    * fake leptons , i.e. , the selected leptons do not originate from either from the decay of a boson , or the decay of a @xmath26 lepton .",
    "* charge flips:,i.e . , the electron charge is mismeasured due to severe bremsstrahlung in the tracker material .",
    "* rare sm processes which mostly come from @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the contributions of these three sources are reported separately in ref .",
    "the simulation does not properly reproduce the contribution of the backgrounds with fake or charge - flipped leptons ( instrumental background ) .",
    "therefore , data - driven methods were used to estimate the instrumental background contribution from data in ref .",
    "in addition to the considerable contribution of these backgrounds , they are also the main source of uncertainties",
    ". however , this makes it impossible to precisely predict the expected limit for higher center - of - mass energies or an arbitrary luminosity .",
    "anomalous top - pair production cross section for the process @xmath29 due to @xmath30 anomalous vertices divided by the square of the fcnc branching ratios for the decays br@xmath31 , br@xmath32 , br@xmath33 and br@xmath34 versus the center - of - mass energy .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ] +    to estimate the reach of the search for fcnc anomalous production of same - sign top quarks at the 14 tev lhc using the results of a search identical to the cms search at 8 tev @xcite , we need to estimate the contribution of the instrumental and rare sm backgrounds at the 14 tev lhc .",
    "the method ( which was developed in sec .",
    "3 of ref @xcite)is used to estimate the contribution of instrumental backgrounds .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "due to the final selection criteria , ( specially two the @xmath35-jets requirement ) , @xmath36 is the main source of instrumental background .",
    "so one can scale the rate of these backgrounds with the @xmath36 cross section approximately and predict their contributions at 14 tev . to estimate the contribution of the rare sm backgrounds , we first produce the @xmath27 and @xmath28 samples at 14 tev using madgraph5 @xcite .",
    "we then use pythia @xciteand delphes @xcite to simulate the showering , hadronization , and detector effects with the same condition explained in sec [ sec:32 ] .",
    "finally the same cuts as mentioned before are imposed to find the number of events from @xmath27 and @xmath28 in sr2 .",
    "the prediction of the expected backgrounds at 14 tev is validated by calculating the ratio of the instrumental background to the rare sm backgrounds for sr6 and sr8 and comparing them with the ratios calculated in ref @xcite .",
    "the ratios are fully compatible in both regions , and it is calculated to be 2.02 for sr2 .          in order to estimate the uncertainties of instrumental backgrounds , no detector simulation is performed . the uncertainty obtained from 8 tev",
    "is scaled according to the @xmath36 cross section to evaluate the uncertainty at 14 tev , which leads to a large uncertainty .",
    "it would make our analysis more useful if we could present the results considering different uncertainties from instrumental backgrounds . in order to illustrate the uncertainty effects ,",
    "we define @xmath37    where both rates are calculated after all cuts . combining the rare sm and instrumental backgrounds ,",
    "the 95% predicted exclusion limits are presented in fig .",
    "[ prelimit ] for all signal channels .",
    "the @xmath38 is varied between 1 to 10 to show how the reach of the analysis would change by changing the uncertainty on the instrumental backgrounds . using the nominal value for @xmath39",
    ", it can be seen that the 95% excluded region boundaries have not improved significantly at the 14 tev lhc compared to the 8 tev lhc for the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 signal channels , and the reach is even worse for @xmath43 .",
    "the cms collaboration has updated the same - sign analysis with 19.5 fb@xmath0 of data @xcite .",
    "the total uncertainties are increased in different signal regions by increasing the luminosity from 10.5 fb@xmath0 to 19.5 fb@xmath0 .",
    "our studies show that using updated experimental results would not change the results obtained in this analysis .",
    "this behavior confirms that scaling the instrumental background rates and their related uncertainties to the @xmath36 cross section is a good approximation .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed the same - sign top - quark pair signature of the top - quark flavour - changing neutral interactions through photon , @xmath13 boson , gluon , and higgs boson exchanges in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the experimental results obtained by cms at a center - of - mass energy of 8 tev were used to constrain the top - quark anomalous couplings and branching ratios .",
    "whereas the limits obtained on the the fcnc branching ratios of top - quark decays are found to be noncompetitive compared to recent results derived from anomalous single top - quark production or the anomalous decay of a top quark in @xmath36 events @xcite , these results provide an interesting cross - check of the evidences for the absence of the top - quark fcnc interactions in a different physics process .",
    "the limits could be improved if the cms collaboration updates the same - sign dilepton search by subdividing the signal regions exclusively , so the results from different signal regions could be combined .",
    "an improvement of the lepton and @xmath35-tag efficiencies and the systematic uncertainties on the background predictions would improve the results .    using the results of the cms same - sign dilepton search at 8 tev @xcite",
    ", we tried to predict the possible reach of the 14 tev lhc .",
    "however , the presence of the instrumental backgrounds as an important source of uncertainties makes the prediction of the analysis reach vague .",
    "we find that with selections identical to the 8 tev search no significant improvement is expected to be obtained for the top - quark fcnc process through the same - sign dilepton signature at the 14 tev lhc .",
