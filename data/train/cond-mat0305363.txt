    "we assume that the mean density of states of the normal frequencies is given by the function @xmath50 in the form of weyl - series @xcite , and frequency - frequency correlations can be neglected .    since experimental identification of a particular mode",
    "is complicated by the  missing level  effect or modal overlap we choose to pursue calculation of average spectral density rather than individual modal amplitudes . in order not to distinguish between individual modes at the frequencies of interest , and",

    "the characteristic wavelength on the frequencies of interest is much smaller than the diameter of the solid : @xmath70 .",
    "the leading order nonlinear contribution thus comes from the bulk rather than near - boundary region of the solid .",
    "this allows us to neglect effects of the latter , and approximate the exact green s function @xmath71 in the solid by the green s function in an unbounded medium @xmath72 .",
    "this approximation implies that @xmath59 has an infinite correlation radius inherited from @xmath72 , and leads to formal integral divergence in the calculations of the following sections . to mend the problem we consider the scattering of the field inside the solid as a diffuse process with a free mean path on the order of the diameter @xmath53 , which now provides a finite correlation radius for the model : @xmath73 @xcite .",

    "the modal sum is evaluated as a frequency integral with integrand weighed by the mean density of states:@xmath83 we note that matrix @xmath31 responsible for the cubic nonlinearity does not enter ( [ eq : pi2integrated ] ) , for its contribution is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "the centered gaussian statistics of the modes allows averages in the form of @xmath85 to be expressed as triple products of the pairwise correlations ( [ eq : uprimestatistics ] ) . combining terms with the same modal indices we formally write ( with no implied summation on latin indices )",
    "@xmath86 the coupling functions @xmath87 are defined later .    expression ( [ eq : pi2integrated ] ) with the factors ( [ eq : nfactors ] ) inserted , though bulky and cumbersome to analyze , gives the leading term in the power flow due to a weak nonlinearity . in experimental practice , however , it is not uncommon to deal with the fields that have the spectral energy density @xmath88 varying smoothly on frequency scales @xmath89 greater than the averaging bandwidth of the limited observation time : @xmath90 . in this case ( [ eq : pi2integrated ] ) simplifies further .",

    "a weak change in the energy density due to @xmath80 is not masked by a strong initial linear field , and is convenient for experimental measurement .    with the simplifications",
    "mentioned the power flow expression reduces to @xmath95 the only remaining coupling function is given by contraction of the nonlinear and correlation matrices : @xmath96 we note that@xmath97    the power flow in the form of ( [ eq : pi20density ] ) allows simple interpretation : the energy transfered into a given frequency @xmath98 comes from all pairs of frequencies @xmath99 and @xmath100 that have the given frequency as a combination , i.e. equal to their sum or difference : @xmath101 .",
    "the qualitative result is in agreement with and could have been expected from an elementary theory of nonlinear oscillations @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the nonlinear matrix ( [ eq : nsymmetry ] ) leads to the symmetry of @xmath102 with respect to any interchange of its arguments .",
    "the coupling strength of any triad of frequencies is thus independent of the energy transfer direction .",
    "nevertheless , the power itself exhibits an overall trend of the energy to be transfered up the frequency spectrum , as it is proportional to the density of states at the target frequency @xmath50 .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : pi20density ] ) implies energy growth that is , if @xmath88 s are approximately constant in time , proportional to elapsed time @xmath39 . in discrete spectrum systems such behavior",
    "is found when a triad of frequencies is locked in internal resonance , producing secular terms in the solution obtained by regular perturbation theory .",
    "this is the behavior observed in our case because of the finite time @xmath103 : since individual modes are not resolved , any combination frequency produced by the source frequencies in the frequency range of interest is indistinguishable from at least one of the normal frequencies of the system , which hence lies in effective internal resonance with them .",

    "the feature may be understood by considering nonlinear combinations of plane waves .",
    "we recall that from a plane wave perspective appropriate in the limit @xmath70 , in addition to internal frequency resonance between the source frequencies @xmath99 and @xmath136 and the target frequency @xmath98 , there is an additional requirement for wavevector resonance .",
    "we note that there are two plane wave types in the system , namely longitudinal and transverse .",
    "if the types of the three waves ( at @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) are identical , wavevector resonance ( @xmath137 with @xmath138 ) is always possible , and demands that the three wavevectors are parallel or antiparallel .",
    "if the wave type for one of the frequencies is different from the other two , then wavevector resonance is not always possible ; it depends on the frequency ratio .",
    "if it is possible , there will be a nontrivial angle between the wavevectors .",
    "the transition between possibility and impossibility occurs at certain special frequency ratios , @xmath139 . at these ratios wavenumber resonance occurs with parallel or antiparallel wavevectors",
    "the special frequency ratio depends solely on the poisson ratio of the material . for non - dispersive single wavespeed systems , when @xmath140 , the ratios become @xmath141 and @xmath142 . in this case",
    "the effect is not observed , as one of the source frequencies needs to be zero @xcite .",
    "however , for certain dispersive single wavespeed systems the peaks and discontinuities might still be found , if the dispersion equation of the system is such that the wavenumber resonance is possible .",
    "it is also worth noting that the discontinuity position at leading order is independent of the field strength .",
    "thus field calibration is not required in experimental measurements in order to observe this characteristic feature , for only relative values of @xmath115 are needed .",
    "this makes the method convenient to use in the light of its eventual application to nde .    in order to see whether the presented theory is applicable for experimental verification and eventual use",
    ", we need to provide numerical estimates for transfer times ( [ eg : transferts ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we choose the solid to be equivalent in volume and surface area to a cube with a side of @xmath143 .",
    "the typical values of the transition ( ballistic ) time in the system are of the order @xmath144 .",
    "the carrying frequencies of the two narrow - band signals are taken to be @xmath145 and @xmath146 , so that the break ( heisenberg ) time is of the same order as the absorption times of @xmath147 common to experiment .",
    "the transfer times are calculated for the aluminum block and plotted in figure [ fig : t ] as functions of the linear field strength , characterized by mach number .",

    "it is feasible to generate linear diffuse fields with rms elastic strains corresponding to mach numbers of order @xmath148 that yield transfer times of order @xmath149 ( see figure [ fig : t ] ) .",
    "thus the observation times of the order of the absorption time yield energy densities at combination frequencies some @xmath150 times weaker than the source signal energy , i.e. rms strains of @xmath151 .",
    "these are easily detectable .",
    "we also note that the strain ratio ( combination field to initial field ) is much smaller than unity , so the use of regular perturbation theory is valid for the given time scale .",
    "finally , we calculate transfer times in aluminum and fused silica as a function of source frequency ratio for a fixed mach number ( see figure [ fig : tfixed ] ) .",

    "the frequency dependence of the nonlinear coupling strength in terms of the transfer times reveals the frequency dependence of @xmath115 .",
    "the dips in the transfer times correspond to the peaks of the coupling function , and might be used to estimate poisson s ratio of the material , or as a signature of nonlinearity .",
    "we notice that the energy transfer into near - zero frequencies is inefficient , as manifested by high difference frequency transfer times in the vicinity of @xmath154 .",
    "in the present work we have obtained a formula for the evolution of the average linear energy spectrum ( [ eq : pi20density ] ) of a weakly nonlinear system . except for definition of the modal linear energy @xmath48 ( [ eq : e ] ) , and statistical properties of the normal frequencies @xmath155 and modes @xmath56 ( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) , the result has no reference to the physical nature of the dynamic system governed by nonlinear equations ( [ eq : ode ] ) . with proper generalization of the matrices @xmath29 describing the physical nature of the nonlinearity it might be applicable beyond the scope of elasticity .",
    "we observe that the energy redistribution occurs for triads of frequencies , with one being the sum or difference of the other two .",
    "the average power input into a narrow frequency band is found to be a cumulative effect coming from such interactions in the initial energy spectrum of the field , and to be proportional to the convolution of the energies stored at two frequencies .",
    "relative weight of the interactions is given by the frequency - dependent coupling function @xmath102 ( [ eq : n0 ] ) , and is calculated as a contraction of the nonlinear and correlation matrices @xmath36 and @xmath156 .",
    "the case of chief experimental interest involving an isotropic homogeneous elastic body with nonlinearity given by the five - constant theory and an initial energy spectrum consisting of two narrow - band signals is discussed in detail .",
    "we find that characteristic times for the full energy transfer from the source into combination frequencies depend on the ratio of the source frequencies and exhibit characteristic dips and peaks and discontinuities at special frequency ratios corresponding to wavenumber resonance .",
    "the position of the resonance depends on poisson s ratio .",
    "we also find that the transfer times are reciprocal to the strength of the initial signal given by the square of the corresponding mach number .",
    "the current theory is derived for zero - displacement boundary conditions of a clamped solid , and is impractical for experimental realization . however , for the frequencies of interest the main contribution to the mixing comes from the bulk of the solid . since the near - boundary regions play a lesser role , the authors believe that the energy spectrum evolution for the traction - free elastic solid would exhibit behavior similar to that discussed here , and thus be accessible for experimental verification .",
