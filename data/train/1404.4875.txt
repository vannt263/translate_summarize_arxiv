    "black hole ( bh ) `` feedback '' is often invoked to regulate massive galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while clear evidence exists that powerful radio jets entrain warm gas and carry significant amounts of material out of their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the situation is far less clear for radio - quiet targets , which dominate the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) population . in the past few years",
    ", we have identified a number of radio - quiet quasars with high intrinsic luminosities ( @xmath4 mag ) that show outflowing ionized gas on @xmath5 kiloparsec ( kpc ) scales @xcite . in this paper , we present observations of hot x - ray gas that is aligned with a known 20-kpc  scale ionized gas bubble in the radio - quiet quasar sdss j135646.10 + 102609.0 ( sdss j1356 + 1026 hereafter ) .",

    "the northern nucleus hosts a luminous ( @xmath9 erg s@xmath2 ) obscured quasar that was originally discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on its [ ] @xmath10 emission @xcite . the source was also flagged as a possible dual active nucleus , because of the presence of multiple velocity components in the sdss spectrum , although that classification has been questioned @xcite .",
    "our interest here lies in the @xmath1120 kpc outflow that we discovered in long - slit observations with magellan ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i hereafter ) . in our magellan spectrum ,",
    "we detect the line splitting that is characteristic of an expanding `` bubble '' ( figure [ fig : xrayimage ] ) .",
    "the shell region extends @xmath3 kpc ( @xmath12 ) to the south of the quasar hosted by the northern nucleus . equidistant from the northern nucleus to the north are clumps of [ ]  emission with comparable observed velocities to the bubble .",
    "we thus propose that we are observing an expanding bipolar super - bubble similar to those observed in many star - forming galaxies both with and without agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in paper i , based on the velocity splitting in our long - slit spectrum , we find that the bubble is expanding symmetrically about the northern nucleus with deprojected velocities of @xmath13 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we infer that the outflow is driving a shell of ionized gas with a kinetic energy of ( @xmath1110@xmath1410@xmath15 erg s@xmath2 ) , and we argue that accretion energy is the most likely energy source driving the outflow .",
    "we consider alternative sources to power the outflow , such as a relativistic jet or star formation in the host galaxy , and conclude that neither of these alternatives is energetic enough to produce the observed structures . since sdss  j1356@xmath61026  is radio - quiet , with a radio source that is unresolved by first @xcite , we think it unlikely that a kpc - scale jet is driving the emission ( although deeper radio data should be illuminating , wrobel et al . in prep ) .    converting the observed far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity into a star formation rate of @xmath16  @xmath17  yr@xmath2 yields a kinetic luminosity of @xmath18 erg  s@xmath2 @xcite , at the low end of our estimates .",
    "however , the star formation rate is likely far lower than this .",
    "based on the gas surface density inferred from alma observations of co in sdss  j1356@xmath61026 , combined with a fit to the far - infrared spectral energy distribution , we find a star formation rate that is @xmath19  @xmath17  yr@xmath2 under a number of conservative assumptions ( a. sun et al .",

    "furthermore , the high level of @xmath20 optical polarization that we present in paper i argues strongly that the agn dominates the blue light at optical wavelengths .",
    "-0 mm        our preferred model , as described in paper i , is that radiative energy from the agn itself is driving a shocked wind into the interstellar medium of the galaxy , and further out into the intergalactic medium .",

    "we present the extracted counts in each region in table 1 . because there are only a small number of counts in each source region",
    ", we use the bayesian method of @xcite to estimate the uncertainties on the net counts .",
    "spectra were extracted from the clump , bubble , northern nucleus , and total non - nuclear regions , along with a background spectrum from the 2@xmath23 background region .",
    "the unbinned spectra were fit in sherpa @xcite using @xcite statistics .",
    "the spectral model for the clump , bubble , and total extended regions was an absorbed @xcite thermal plasma model ( apec ) at the redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "the confidence intervals for the parameters are determined using the task conf within sherpa , taking into account the presence of several variables in the fit .",
    "we fix the abundances to their solar values for our fiducial fit . in figure",

    "each parameter of interest @xmath27 is stepped through a grid of 100 points between the limits shown , and @xmath27 is held fixed while all other parameters are allowed to vary to find the best fit at this value of @xmath27 .",

    "the two - dimensional confidence contours are created in a similar way , and plotted at the @xmath28 levels . within the context of a thermal plasma model",
    ", @xmath25 is very low no matter the value of the other parameters .",
    "this low temperature can be seen from the x - ray counts themselves ; the majority of the extended counts are below 1 kev .",
    "it may be that the assumption of solar abundances is incorrect ; @xcite find abundances closer to half the solar value in the x - ray halo of ngc 6240 , perhaps with a component of one - tenth solar metallicity as well . as an additional check , we also fit models with abundances one - half and one - tenth solar and find differences in the best - fit _ kt _ only at the @xmath29 level .",
    "the absorbing column consists of two components , one fixed at the milky way value of @xmath30 in the direction of sdss j1356 + 1026 @xcite , and an additional component at the redshift of sdss j1356 + 1026 .",
    "no additional absorption was required , with @xmath31 upper limits given in table 1 .",
    "we calculate the unabsorbed fluxes from the best - fit models .",
    "to estimate the uncertainties in the flux , we used the sample_energy_flux command in sherpa to obtain 10000 samples of the energy flux , taking into account the uncertainties in all of the spectral parameters .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by statistical uncertainties at these flux levels , and we use the standard deviations of these sets of samples as the uncertainties for the fluxes ( table 1 ) . while we are fitting a low total number of counts , the fact that the photons are all at very low energies rules out both high temperatures and large absorbing columns .",
    "the agreement between all three region fits provides extra support for our methodology and derived uncertainties .",
    "the north nucleus itself was fit with an absorbed power - law model [ with slope @xmath32 , @xmath33 with the same absorption components as above .",
    "surprisingly , we find no evidence for intrinsic absorption in the x - ray spectrum , although the source is classified as a narrow - line agn in the optical and we have detected 8% polarization , usually a tell - tale sign of an obscured agn ( paper i ) .",
    "the best - fit power - law slope is @xmath34 , and the column - density settled at the minimum value , with a @xmath31 upper uncertainty of @xmath35  @xmath36 .",
    "this is a standard power - law slope for local unobscured seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the source is similar to `` changing - look '' agns , which transition from compton - thick to thin , but are obscured in the optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .      in determining the nature of the x - rays ,",
    "we compare their morphology and luminosity of the warm ionized gas , as traced by [ ]  in our long - slit magellan data @xcite and three - band _ hst_/wfc3 imaging in f435w ( @xmath37band ) , f814w ( @xmath38band ) , and f160w ( @xmath39band ) from comerford et al .  in prep .",
    "the total [ ]  luminosity within our slit is @xmath40  erg  s@xmath2 . because the line emission is spatially extended ,",
    "this estimate is strictly a lower limit .",
    "given that the majority of the emission visible in the _",
    "hst_images align with our slit , we expect we are within a factor of two to three of the total [ ]  emission . from our long - slit data , we determine that the nuclear emission within 1  of the north nucleus accounts for only @xmath41 of the total flux , a small fraction compared to the larger ( and more uncertain ) aperture corrections .",
    "thus , we consider the extended [ ]  emission to have a luminosity of @xmath42}\\approx 10^{43}$ ]  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "we trace the overall line morphology using the _ hst_/wfc3 f438w and f814w images , because the line emission has high enough equivalent width to be observed in a broad - band image ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the morphology of the x - rays matches that of the line emission , to the extent we can tell from these relatively shallow observations .",
    "we find a total soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath43  erg  s@xmath2 with a best - fit temperature of @xmath44 ev , and a total [ ]  luminosity in the extended component of @xmath45  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus the extended x - ray emission is roughly an order of magnitude fainter than the extended [ ]  emission .",
    "we discuss below the possible origins of the overwhelmingly soft extended x - ray emission .",
    "the prime suspects , in order from least to most probable , are electron scattering , superwind - driven shocks , and photoionization .",
    "we note that @xcite also suggest merger - driven shocks as the heating mechanism of the x - ray emitting gas in arp 220 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar arguments about ngc 6240 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , non - starbursting mergers do not appear to show similar x - ray halos , strongly suggesting winds over mergers as the heating mechanism .",
    "electron scattering of the agn continuum could provide x - ray photons , but can not account for the observations .",
    "for one thing , scattering would not change the hard spectral slope intrinsic to the agn , so can not explain the very soft extended x - rays . secondly",
    ", the scattering efficiency is too low to account for the observed luminosity . if we assume that the intrinsic uv luminosity is @xmath11 twice that of the infrared bump in paper i ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can estimate an intrinsic @xmath46[2000  @xmath47=3\\times 10^{45}$ ] erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "assuming that all uv emission is due to electron - scattered light from the nucleus places an upper limit on the electron - scattering efficiency of 3% ( much less so if there is a contribution from dust ) .",
    "since electron - scattering is wavelength independent and dust scattering is negligible at x - ray wavelengths , and given the luminosity of the north nucleus @xmath48  erg  s@xmath2 , an upper limit to the scattered x - ray luminosity is @xmath49 erg  s@xmath2 , or @xmath50 } \\ll 0.003 $ ] , much lower than the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "finally , the amount of scattering is constrained by the amount of line emission . from @xcite , if we take @xmath51  @xmath52 and @xmath53  kpc , we expect @xmath50 } \\approx 0.005 $ ] , also lower than the ratio of @xmath54 that is observed .",
    "perhaps the most exciting possibility is that we are detecting shocked gas associated with a wide - angle , quasar - driven wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a super - wind would have similar properties to those blown by starbursts , but the gas would be heated by the accreting black hole rather than star formation .    to estimate the expected luminosity in the soft x - rays from a superwind",
    ", we follow @xcite and assume that the expanding bubble of hot gas behaves like a supernova remnant , with negligible radiative losses , in order to translate our estimated mechanical luminosity of @xmath55  erg  s@xmath2 into an expected x - ray luminosity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "their derived relationship is : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is in units of @xmath58  erg  s@xmath2 , @xmath59 is the density in units of @xmath60  @xmath52 and @xmath61 is the estimated age of the bubble in units of @xmath62 yr .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity has @xmath63 , with apec calculating the emissivity @xmath64 , @xmath65 the volume filling factor , @xmath66 , and the volume @xmath67 assumed to be a cylinder with length 20 kpc and radius 2 kpc . from the apec spectral model , we find a best - fit electron density of @xmath68  @xmath52 .",
    "we emphasize that the normalization is poorly constrained from these data ( figure [ fig : showfit ] , but it is interesting to perform this estimate nevertheless . taking @xmath69 yr and the range of mechanical luminosity from paper i , we find @xmath70  erg  s@xmath2 , in agreement with what we observe .",
    "the corresponding x - ray emitting gas mass is @xmath71  @xmath17 , with a total thermal energy of @xmath72 erg , or @xmath73  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainties in these calculations are quite large , due to the uncertainties in the spectral fitting and the unknown volume and volume filling factor . however , the kinetic luminosity needed to power the x - ray outflow is within a factor of three of what we inferred from the ionized gas outflow .",
    "on the other hand , models of superwinds suggest that the wind is powered by far more tenuous and hotter gas than we observe here , @xmath74  k for starbursts @xcite and perhaps even hotter for agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case",
    ", the soft x - rays may come from the surfaces of clouds as they are shocked by the wind , and the x - ray luminosity can not be inferred directly from the mechanical energy estimates . however",
    ", we can still phenomenologically compare the x - rays that we observe with other known superwinds .",
    "most of the bolometric luminosity of starbursts and obscured quasars is radiated at infrared wavelengths .",
    "therefore , it is useful to compare extended soft x - ray to total infrared flux ratios for a variety of wind - driving systems . in starburst galaxies over a wide range in mass , including ulirgs , @xcite find @xmath75 .",
    "the ratio in sdss  j1356@xmath61026  is consistent with this value .",
    "likewise the size scales as one might naively expect from the infrared luminosity .",
    "the one way in which the x - ray gas observed here differs significantly from that observed in starbursts is the temperature .",
    "most of the ulirgs in the grimes et al",
    ".  sample have temperatures of _ _ kt__@xmath76 ev , as compared with the _ _ kt__@xmath0 ev observed here . based on our fitting",
    ", we rule out a temperature of 600 ev at greater than 10  @xmath77 confidence .",
    "this low inferred temperature may be a clue that we are instead seeing photoionized gas .      since we know that the central agn is photoionizing gas on large scales , and because of the correspondence in morphology between the soft x - ray and warm ionized gas , we lastly consider the possibility that what appears as x - ray continuum at our low spectral resolution is actually composed of photoionized line emission .",
    "detailed analysis of the extended x - ray emission around local seyfert galaxies has found strong evidence that the soft x - ray emission is dominated by photoionization on large scales @xcite and comprised predominantly of line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although on galaxy scales collisional ionization is also important ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on these works , the @xmath50}$ ] ranges from @xmath78 , and is fairly constant with radius .",
    "the relatively low temperatures of _ _ kt__@xmath79 ev are consistent with the temperatures that result from thermal fits to other seyfert galaxies . also , the observed ratio of x - ray to [ ]  luminosity of @xmath80 is consistent with expectations from photoionized gas ( and is identical to that seen in ngc 4051 by wang et al .",
    "furthermore , the orientation of the x - ray emission ( n - s ) aligns with the direction of quasar illumination inferred from the position angle in polarimetric observations ( paper i ) .",
    "we have detected soft x - rays from an expanding bubble of warm ionized gas in the obscured quasar and ulirg sdss  j1356@xmath61026 .",
    "we discuss various origins for the x - ray emission , concluding that the most probable are photoionization and/or shocks from a quasar - driven superwind . to determine the real origin of this emission requires deeper x - ray observations . as in @xcite",
    ", we hope to distinguish between the spectrum of a thermally emitting gas , as expected in the wind picture , from the line - dominated spectrum expected if photoionization excites the gas . in the wind picture",
    ", we expect that there is a hotter and more tenuous wind component to search for , although the expected temperature and luminosity is quite model dependent .",
    "in addition , the morphology of the soft x - rays will provide further clues to its origin . in the hot wind scenario ,",
    "the x - rays will be uniformly distributed within the bubbles , whereas in the photoionization scenario , the x - rays will trace the distribution of [ ]  emission in the bubbles .",
