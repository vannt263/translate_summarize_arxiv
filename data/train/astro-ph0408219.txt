    "3 ) is probably due to the combination of free - free and bound - free emissions , corresponding to what is seen optically and coincides well with the radio brightness of gmrt at 1280 mhz shown in fig .",
    "the extended filaments of h@xmath11 line emission to the n - w of the irs 13 cluster around the photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) at the interface between h ii and molecular cloud are particularly striking ( fig . 5 and davis et al .",

    "2 appears elongated northward by 60 . the high resolution radio map ( inset in fig .",
    "2 ) resolves this elongation into two lobes with a separation of 26  in the n - s direction .",
    "the fluffy nebula associated with irs 9 is revealed @xmath0 2  south - east of irs 1 .",
    "a few red young stars are located at the easternmost tip of the nebula .",
    "the fluffy morphology as well as the dark patches extending 70  to the west plausibly arises from reflection illuminated by these red sources ( see fig",

    "( 1998 ) is indicated in fig .",
    "two small peculiar nebulosities are also revealed at the north - east corner in the composite image of fig . 3 and in the continuum - subtracted h@xmath11 image of fig .",
    "5 . the enlarged view of this region is shown in fig . 12d .",
    "the selected regions with individual ir sources and associated nebulosities are described in detail in  3.8 .      in the diffuse h ii region , there lie five radio peaks in fig .",
    "although three bright irs sources lie therein , none of them coincide with any radio peaks .",
    "irs 5 , located close ( @xmath0 6  n - w ) to the brightest radio peak and assigned as o9 type star in the h - k vs. k color - magnitude diagram ( see fig . 7",
    "; moreno & chavarria 1986 ) , might be responsible for the nearby radio peak , but is still insufficient to power the whole h ii region .",
    "irs 6 , the brightest infrared source in the h ii region , is located @xmath0 27  ( @xmath0 0.37 pc in projection ) north - east of the brightest radio peak and is estimated to be an o6-o7 type from its color and ir luminosity ( wynn - williams et al . 1974 ; moreno & chavarria 1986 ) .",
    "irs 7 has been identified as a k type foreground star ( moreno & chavarria 1986 ) , and irs 8 does not coincide with any optical or radio feature ( wynn - williams et al . 1974 ) .",
    "irs 7 and irs 8 are most probably not associated with the ngc 7538 nebula ( wynn - williams et al . 1974 ; zheng et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "it is most plausible that irs 6 is the main exciting source responsible for this h ii region .",
    "however , the theoretical stromgren radius of the h ii region ionized by an o6 type star is roughly fifteen times larger than the observed one ( see fig .",
    "it means that the h ii region is under expansion and the central star ( irs 6 ) is at a very early stage of its evolution . but the number of uv photons emitted by o stars dramatically changes with the spectral sub - class .",
    "in addition , young o stars are often surrounded by some amount of dust , which attenuates the uv emission to ionize the surrounding gas . as a result",
    "the size of the stromgren sphere is reduced compared to the ideal case .",
    "therefore , the precise spectral type of the exciting star and information on the amount of the surrounding dust are required for a quantitative discussion of the evolution of the ngc 7538 h ii region .    in figs .",
    "4 & 5 , a cavity wall is apparent with a steep cliff running from n - w to s - e of both co and radio emission ( but with opposite gradients in the n - e / s - w direction ) , and a gradual decrease of the radio emission as well as the h@xmath14 emission ( see moreno & chavarria 1986 ) from s - w to n - e . at the cliff",
    "the h ii region is plausibly ionization - bounded , while it is density - bounded toward the n - e .",

    "the reference field is also used for the correction of field star contamination in the raw k@xmath1-band luminosity function of ngc 7538 ( see  3.5 ) . in figs .",
    "6a and 6b , the solid and broken heavy curves represent the unreddened main sequence and giant branches ( bessell & brett 1988 ) and the parallel dashed lines are the reddening vectors for early and late type stars ( drawn from the base and tip of the two branches ) . the dotted lines indicate the locus of t - tauri stars ( meyer et al .",

    "6a , the stars in ngc 7538 are distributed in a much wider range than those in the reference field ( fig .",
    "6b ) , which indicates that a large fraction of the observed sources in ngc 7538 exhibit nir excess emission characteristics of young stars with circumstellar materials as well as a wide range of reddening .",

    "an apparent main sequence track is noticeable with a@xmath10 @xmath0 4 mag in this diagram ; but a comparison of it with a similar diagram for the stars in the reference field shows that it is a false sequence caused by field stars in the foreground of the ngc 7538 region . the vertical solid lines ( from left to right in fig .",
    "7 ) represent the main sequence curve reddened by a@xmath10 = 0 , 20 , 40 and 60 mag , respectively . we have assumed a distance of 2.8 kpc to the sources to reproduce the main sequence data on this plot .",

    "three bright and very red objects ( k @xmath22 12.0 , h - k @xmath28 4.0 ) located in the upper right corner of the figure are the very young stars irs 1 , irs 9 , and irs 9n1 in their earliest evolutionary phases ( see  3.8 and figs .",

    "most of them are clustered near the massive molecular clumps surrounding the luminous infrared sources irs 13 .",
    "some of them are expected to be members of the embedded stellar clusters around irs 13 and to the south of irs 13 ( i.e. around irs 11 ) .",
    "therefore , these sources associated with the molecular clumps around irs 9 , irs 11 and irs 13 ( sunada et al .",
    ", in preparation ) are embedded pms stars , presumably .",
    "a few red sources are also seen around the ionization front at the interface between the h ii region and the molecular cloud , which might have formed due to the triggered star formation .",
    "the average extinction through the molecular cloud in ngc 7538 that hosts the very red sources is a@xmath10 @xmath0 15 mag ( h - k @xmath0 1 ) . if we assume that the large h - k ( @xmath28 2 ) color results merely from interstellar reddening affecting normal stars , then the extinction value might even exceed 40 mag in the molecular cloud where most of the red stars are found .",
    "however , with such a large amount of absorption , diffuse emissions are unlikely to be detected in the nir .",
    "since most of the red sources are associated with faint diffuse emission around irs 13 , irs 9 , and irs 11 , this provides evidence that these sources are ysos with intrinsic nir excess and possibly local extinction also . in fig .",
    "7 , a large fraction ( @xmath0 96% ) of these sources are located above the straight line drawn from an a0 star parallel to the extinction vector .",
    "this suggests that they are intermediate mass stars with circumstellar materials .",
    "based on the clustering of different yso candidates in ngc 7538 , the overall morphology is of three major condensations , which may form a sequence in age : the diffuse h ii region ( north - west : oldest ) ; the compact ir core ( center ) ; and the regions with the extensive ir reflection nebula and a cluster of red young stars ( south - east and south : youngest ) .",
    "this subject is further discussed in  3.7 .",
    "we use the k@xmath1-band luminosity function ( klf ) to constrain the initial mass function ( imf ) and age of the embedded stellar population in ngc 7538 . to derive the klf",
    ", we have determined the completeness of the data through artificial star experiments using addstar in iraf .",
    "this was performed by adding fake stars in random positions into the images at 0.5 magnitude intervals and then by checking how many of the added stars could be recovered at various magnitude intervals .",
    "we repeated this procedure at least 8 times .",
    "we thus obtained the detection rate as a function of magnitude , which is defined as the ratio of the number of recovered artificial stars over the number of added stars .    in order to estimate the foreground and background contaminations , we made use of both the galactic model by robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the reference field star counts .",
    "the star counts were predicted using the besanon model of stellar population synthesis ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) in the direction of the reference field close to the ngc 7538 ( see  2 ) , that is also corrected for the photometric completeness . by comparing the resultant model klf with that of the reference field ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , we found that the simulation fits fairly well with the data .",
    "an advantage of using the model is that we can separate the contamination from the foreground ( d @xmath22 2.8 kpc ) and the background ( d @xmath28 2.8 kpc ) field stars . as we saw in  3.4 ,",
    "the average extinction to the ngc 7538 region is a@xmath10 @xmath0 15 mag ( h - k @xmath0 1 ) .",
    "assuming spherical geometry , then background stars are seen through a@xmath10 @xmath0 30 mag ( 2@xmath415 mag ) .",
    "therefore , we applied an extinction value of a@xmath10 = 30 mag ( or a@xmath27 = 3.36 mag ) in simulating the background stars .",
    "we combined the foreground and background stars to make a whole set of the contamination field and obtained the fraction of the contaminating stars over the total model counts .",
    "then we scaled the model prediction to the star counts in the reference field , and subtracted the combined foreground ( d @xmath22 2.8 kpc ) and background ( d @xmath28 2.8 kpc with a@xmath27 = 3.36 mag ) data from the klf of the ngc 7538 region .    after correcting for the foreground and background star contamination and photometric completeness ,",
    "the resulting klfs are presented in fig .",
    "10 for the whole ngc 7538 region .",
    "they follow power - laws in shape . in fig .",
    "10 , a power - law with a slope @xmath14 [ @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of stars brighter than @xmath31 has been fitted to each klf ( figs . 10a and 10b ) using the linear least - squares fitting routine . to discuss the relationship between the klf slopes and the star forming environment of each region , we divided the ngc 7538 region into two rectangular areas : the `` younger '' region ( irs 13 , irs 9 , and irs 11 regions ) , and the `` older '' region above irs 13 ( see figs . 1 and 8 and  3.4 ) .",
    "the derived power - law slopes for the `` younger '' , `` older '' , and whole ngc 7538 regions are shown in table 2 .",
    "we also note that the background subtraction does not significantly change the power - law slope ( fig .",
    "10 and table 2 ) .",
    "we find a small increase ( 1@xmath3 result , see table 2 ) in the klf slope from the `` younger '' region ( @xmath14 @xmath0 0.27 ) to the most evolved `` older '' region ( @xmath14 @xmath0 0.33 ) in ngc 7538 ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "this is consistent with an expected change in the klf slope with age if the imf is identical in the whole ngc 7538 region ( megeath et al .",
    "however , such a small effect is not significant in view of the reddening and excess due to circumstellar material .",
    "we , therefore , assume a coeval population of stars and derive the klf of the whole ngc 7538 star forming region for comparison with other regions and a rough estimate of stellar masses in the next section .",
    "the klf of the whole ngc 7538 region shows a power - law slope that is lower than those generally reported for the young embedded clusters ( @xmath32 , e.g. lada et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ; lada & lada 2003 ) , although equally low values have also been reported in the w3 main star forming region ( megeath et al . 1996 ; ojha et al .",
    "thus , this low value of the slope is indeed the intrinsic property of the stellar population in this region . using the analysis as given in detail by megeath et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the estimated klf slope of the whole ngc 7538 region is roughly consistent with the miller - scalo imf if the age of ngc 7538 population is @xmath0 1 myr .",
    "11 shows the cm diagram ( j - h vs j ) for 286 yso candidate sources identified in figs .",
    "we estimate the mass of the stellar sources by comparing them with the evolutionary models of pms stars ( palla & stahler 1999 ) .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "11 denotes the loci of 10@xmath33 yr old pms stars and the dotted curve for those of 0.3@xmath34 yr old pms stars .",
    "masses range from 0.1 to 4 m@xmath6 from bottom to top , for both curves . to estimate the stellar masses , we use the j luminosity rather than that of h or k@xmath1 , as j - band",
    "is less affected by the emission from circumstellar materials ( bertout , basri , & bouvier 1988 ) .    if the age of ngc 7538 population is @xmath0 1 myr as estimated from the klf slope ( see  3.5 ) , @xmath0 88% of the yso candidates detected in j , h , and k@xmath1-bands have masses less than 3 m@xmath6 , and at least @xmath0 80% of the stars have masses less than 2 m@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "even if the age of the stars is 0.3 myr , @xmath0 92% of the stars have masses below 3 m@xmath6 . at the distance of 2.8 kpc , assuming an age of @xmath0 1 myr , and an extinction at j band of up to @xmath0 2 mag ( a@xmath10 @xmath0 7 ) , the j magnitude limit ( corresponding to 10 @xmath3 mag detection limit ) corresponds to m @xmath0 0.1 m@xmath6 , according to the pms evolutionary tracks from palla & stahler ( 1999 ) .",
    "this gives an estimate of the lowest mass limits of the detected stars in the ngc 7538 star forming region in our sample .",
    "therefore , the stellar population in ngc 7538 may be primarily composed of low mass pms stars similar to those observed in the w3 main star forming region ( ojha et al .",
    "we also see the presence of lower mass stars forming the clusters ( e.g. near the irs 13 and irs 48 regions ) together with the newly formed o - b type stars .",
    "these results further support the hypothesis that the formation of high mass stars is associated with the formation of clusters of low mass stars ( e.g. lada & lada 1991 ; zinnecker , mccaughrean , & wilking 1993 ; persi et al .",
    "1994 ; tapia et al .",
    "1997 ; ojha et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the ngc 7538 star forming complex seems to be composed of several structures of different evolutionary stages aligned from north - west to south - east .",
    "the first is the north - western region , which corresponds to the visible h ii region . here , in addition to the optically visible o - type stars ( e.g. , irs 5 and 6 ) we detect a large number of class ii and class i sources ( see fig . 8) .",
    "this north - western region is undoubtedly more evolved than other regions of the ngc 7538 complex , which contains the majority of red sources but , in contrast , a far smaller number of class ii and class i sources .",
    "presumably the star forming activity has already been over in this region except for the interface with the molecular cloud to the south - west , where we notice a few red sources .",
    "secondly , a distinct core of star forming activity is found near the center of our survey area .",
    "it is a compact region around irs 1 - 3 surrounded by the bright ir nebula .",
    "these ir sources are all newly formed ob - star candidates . together with the ( ultra- ) compact h ii regions which they have started to develop , they are deeply embedded in the dense molecular core . here",
    "we also notice a concentration of red sources .",
    "most probably extensive star forming activity is currently taking place in this region .",
    "turning our eyes further to the south - east , we find a rather scattered distribution of red sources and class ii candidates .",
    "we consider they comprise the third region of star forming activity in the ngc 7538 complex .",
    "it seems to be composed of two substructures ; one corresponds to the fluffy reflection nebula associated with irs 9 , 9n1 , 9n2 and 9n3 ( the south - eastern region ) , the other is the region surrounding irs 11 and an elongated grouping of red stars ( the southern region ) . the extensive reflection nebula is a manifestation of massive outflows associated with irs 9 ( tamura et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the presence of massive outflows associated with irs 9 and the existence of masers and ngc 7538 s ( class 0 candidate , ",
    "3.8.3 ) around irs 11 are a clear signpost of an early phase of star formation in these regions .",
    "therefore , this third region , both south - eastern and southern , is located in the molecular cloud and must be very young in terms of star formation .",
    "the question can then be raised : what is the time sequence of star formation history in ngc 7538 ?",
    "the central region appears to be the result of the propagation of star formation activity from the north - west region due to the expansion of the h ii region and the compression of the molecular cloud in the north - western interface .",
    "its location adjacent to the ngc 7538 h ii region and the dense concentration of ysos between h ii region and irs 1 - 3 core match quite well the characteristics of sequential star formation ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "the complex to the south and south - east might have evolved independently from the same molecular cloud . since this region",
    "is separated from the optical h ii region of ngc 7538 , the star formation here is independent of the action of its expansion , and appears to have been taking place spontaneously , as suggested by mccaughrean , rayner & zinnecker ( 1991 ) .",
    "alternatively , it could be possible that some larger scale trigger might have played a role , resulting in the entire sequence of these three stages of star formation activity . in order to answer this question ,",
    "however , it might be crucial to reveal the yso population on a much larger scale .      in fig .",
    "12 we present some selected areas of the ngc 7538 star forming region in our high resolution ( 0.7 ) nir images that are of particular interest .",
    "ngc 7538 irs 13 is a group of three infrared sources in the very bright red core in the center of the image ( fig .",
    "these three high luminosity infrared sources are located at the boundary of the h ii region ( see fig .",
    "they were found in a 2.2 @xmath8 m and 20 @xmath8 m survey of ngc 7538 ( wynn - williams et al .",

    "irs 1 is identified as an ultracompact ( uc ) h ii region , while irs 2 and 3 are compact and optically thin compact h ii regions , respectively ( campbell 1984 ; campbell & persson 1988 ) .",
    "irs 2 is embedded in the center of the compact ir nebula , whereas irs 1 and irs 3 are located near the south and south - western borders of the nebula , respectively ( fig .",

    "this source is detected only in h and k@xmath1-band among our images ( table 1 ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution submillimeter data resolved the young uc h ii region around irs 1 and it was shown that the uc h ii region is surrounded by a cluster of submillimeter sources , none of which have near or mid - infrared counterparts ( sandell & sievers 2004 ) .",

    "two of them near the tip are associated with a `` silhouette shell '' . while comparing with the polarization map ( tamura et al .",
    "1991 ) , we find that irs 9n1 is probably not an independent source but is most likely an unresolved gaseous knot in the nebula , because the degree of polarization is very high at the position of irs 9n1 and the polarization pattern is not disturbed . for other sources ( irs 9n2 and 9n3 )",
    "the polarization is locally small or the pattern is disturbed .",
    "these red sources as well as a nearby bluer source irs n4 ( marked by `` n4 '' in fig . 12b ; see table 1 ) are most probably very young stars in their earliest evolutionary phases and appear to be associated with small scale circumstellar matter that obscures the background nebula ( we call them silhouette shell ) .",

    "<S> we present sub - arcsecond ( fwhm @xmath0 0.7 ) , near - infrared ( nir ) jhk@xmath1-band images and a high sensitivity radio continuum image at 1280 mhz , using on uh 88-inch telescope and gmrt . </S>",
    "<S> the nir survey covers an area of @xmath0 24 arcmin@xmath2 with 10 @xmath3 limiting magnitudes of @xmath0 19.5 , 18.4 , and 17.3 in j , h , and k@xmath1-band , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our nir images are deeper than any jhk surveys to date for the larger area of ngc 7538 star forming region . </S>",
    "<S> we construct jhk color - color and j - h / j and color - magnitude diagrams to identify young stellar objects ( ysos ) and to estimate their masses . </S>",
    "<S> based on these color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , we identified a rich population of ysos ( class i and class ii ) , associated with the ngc 7538 region . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of red sources have also been detected around ngc 7538 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these red stars are most probably pre - main sequence stars with intrinsic color excesses . </S>",
    "<S> most of ysos in ngc 7538 are arranged from the north - west toward south - east regions , forming a sequence in age : the diffuse h ii region ( north - west , oldest : where most of the class ii and class i sources are detected ) ; the compact ir core ( center ) ; and the regions with the extensive ir reflection nebula and a cluster of red young stars ( south - east and south ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the slope of the k@xmath1-band luminosity function of ngc 7538 is lower than the typical values reported for the young embedded clusters , although equally low values have also been reported in the w3 main star forming region . from the slope of the k@xmath1-band luminosity function and the analysis by megeath et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1996 ) , we infer that the embedded stellar population is comprised of ysos with an age of @xmath0 1 myr . based on the comparison between models of pre - main sequence stars with the observed color - magnitude diagram we find that the stellar population in ngc 7538 is primarily composed of low mass pre - main sequence stars similar to those observed in the w3 main star forming region . </S>",
    "<S> the radio continuum image from the gmrt observations at 1280 mhz shows an arc - shaped structure due to the interaction between the h ii region and the adjacent molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization front at the interface between the h ii region and the molecular cloud is clearly delineated by comparing the radio continuum , molecular line , and near - infrared images . </S>"
