    "a growing body of experimental evidence indicates that glassy materials exhibit broad spectra of linear relaxation modes .",
    "most definitively , the frequency dependent loss modulus , @xmath1 , exhibits a broad peak that has a maximum near the viscous relaxation rate and extends over two or more decades of higher frequencies .",
    "this behavior has been seen in structural and metallic glasses @xcite , and also in soft glassy materials such as colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for a broad relaxation spectrum emerges from strain recovery experiments , in which materials are unloaded abruptly after shear deformation @xcite .",
    "our intention in this paper is to develop a theory that quantitatively accounts for these measurements , extending the results announced in @xcite . to date , two of the most successful descriptions of these phenomena have been the soft glassy rheology ( sgr ) theory of sollich , cates , et al .",
    "@xcite , and the attempt by cates and coworkers to use mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for similar purposes @xcite . here ,",
    "we base our analysis on the shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory of amorphous plasticity @xcite .",
    "we contend that the stz theory provides a more suitable starting point than either sgr or mct . ultimately , however , our goal is to find a description of linear glassy dynamics that combines the strongest elements of all three of these theories .",
    "in contrast to sgr , which postulates a trap - like mechanism , the stz theory is based directly on a model of the localized shear transformations that are observed in colloidal suspensions , bubble rafts , and molecular dynamics simulations , and that presumably occur in molecular glasses as well .",
    "the stz theory also describes the nonequilibrium flow of energy and entropy in a way that has not yet been achieved in sgr . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of trapping energies that is an essential component of sgr has , until now , been missing in the stz theory . incorporating",
    "this feature of sgr into the stz theory is a main theme of the present paper .",
    "in contrast to mct , which starts with a fluidlike many - body hamiltonian and makes decoupling approximations , the stz theory is based on a solidlike picture of an amorphous system .",
    "this is an intrinsically non - perturbative strategy . among other phenomena",
    ", this strategy allows the stz theory to predict a sharp dynamic transition between jammed and flowing states  a transition that seems difficult to achieve in any perturbation - theoretic analysis that starts with liquidlike variables  but which is accomplished at least in part in @xcite .",
    "the success of the stz theory comes at the expense of a seemingly irreducible degree of phenomenology . without a precise basis in many - body physics ,",
    "the stz theory ( like sgr ) must postulate a set of relevant internal dynamic variables and use whatever constraints are available  symmetry principles , the laws of thermodynamics , physical insight , and agreement with experiment  to deduce equations of motion for those variables .",
    "the stz theory is based on two fundamental assumptions .",
    "the first of these is that the degrees of freedom of a glassy material can be separated into two subsystems  the slow configurational degrees of freedom , i.e. the inherent structures @xcite , and the fast kinetic - vibrational degrees of freedom which , in the case of colloids , include the motions of the fluid in which the particles are suspended @xcite .",
    "when external perturbations drive the material away from equilibrium , the effective temperature of the configurational subsystem may depart from the temperature of the kinetic - vibrational subsystem .",
    "the latter temperature generally is the same as the temperature of the thermal reservoir .",
    "the second fundamental premise of the theory is that irreversible shear deformations occur only at rare , localized , two - state , flow defects .",
    "these are the stz s which , by definition , belong to the configurational subsystem . in flowing states , the stz s appear and disappear as the driven system makes transitions between its inherent structures . in jammed states ,",
    "the stz s are configurationally frozen , but they still are able to make transitions between their internal states in response to ordinary thermal fluctuations and applied stresses .",
    "the two - state nature of the stz s is chiefly responsible for the dynamic transition between jammed and flowing states at large driving stresses . as will be seen here in the linear regime , this two - state dynamics  plus a fundamentally different kinematic starting assumption  produces a formula for the frequency - dependent modulus @xmath2 that is not the same as that which emerges from sgr .",
    "earlier versions of stz theory have been based on the assumption that only one characteristic kind of stz is needed in order to understand stress - strain relations , shear banding instabilities , and the like .",
    "thus , our stz s have had only one statistically significant formation energy , and only a single energy barrier to be crossed during transitions between internal orientational states .",
    "here we follow @xcite and change the latter assumption in order to understand the dynamic measurements ; that is , we need to assume that the stz s occur with a distribution of different internal barrier heights , in much the same way that was deduced experimentally by argon and kuo in 1980 @xcite .",
    "in the sections that follow , we propose a simple form for an extended , multi - barrier stz theory , following our earlier report @xcite . we restrict our attention to the limit of small external stresses , because that is the limit in which the response of the system is most strongly limited by activation barriers .",
    "accordingly , this small - stress , linear - response limit is where we find the clearest experimental evidence for the multi - barrier picture .",
    "we outline the extended stz theory in sec .",
    "[ stz - eom ] . in sec .",
    "[ oscillatory ] we provide a more detailed analysis and additional support for the results announced in @xcite , where the frequency dependent modulus @xmath2 was calculated and compared to the data of @xcite , who performed oscillatory experiments on a wide variety of both hard structural glasses and soft colloidal suspensions .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ recovery ] , we further extend the analysis of @xcite by looking at the evidence for broadly distributed barrier heights that emerges from strain - recovery measurements and subsequent probes of partially recovered , i.e. partially aged , specimens .",
    "we note that the paper by belyavsky et al .",
    "@xcite , dealing with strain recovery in metallic glasses , contains a clear description of two - state shear transformation zones that predates our own @xcite .",
    "we focus here on experiments by purnomo et al @xcite on colloidal suspensions , in which the strain was measured following a period of large , persistent deformation and then abrupt unloading .",
    "we find that strain recovery is determined in part by the initial barrier - height distribution , but that true structural aging also occurs during this process and strongly determines the subsequent linear responses . in particular , we find that the initial deformation produces a highly disordered state with a large population of low activation barriers , and that this state equilibrates quickly toward one in which the distribution is dominated by high barriers .    a recurring theme thoughout secs .",
    "[ stz - eom ] - [ recovery ] is the question of what determines the barrier - height distribution and how this distribution changes during aging . to discuss this issue quantitatively , we start by considering fully aged or slowly aging systems in which these distributions approach states of quasi - equilibrium determined by the current values of the effective temperature and other relevant parameters .",
    "we argue that these distributions are limited by the condition that stz transition rates can not be slower than the rates of spontaneous , thermally activated , configurational rearrangements in glassy materials .",
    "we then make a phenomenological guess about the form of the barrier - height distribution for younger systems at higher effective temperatures , such as those that occur in the strain - recovery experiments . in this way , we are able to make some progress in understanding the physics of these phenomena ; but we have not yet developed an equation of motion for the stz barrier - height distribution analogous to the one that serves as a starting assumption in sgr .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in sec.[conclusions ] .",
    "as in almost all earlier presentations , it is easiest and physically most transparent to assume that the stz s are oriented only in the @xmath3 directions relative to the shear stress @xmath4 .",
    "we lose no generality by doing this ; the tensorial generalizations of the equations are obvious at the end of the analysis , but are not needed for present purposes .    in order to describe colloidal suspensions as well as molecular glasses , however , we must recognize that the total stress @xmath4 acting on the system is the sum of partial stresses associated with the configurational and kinetic - vibrational subsystems .",
    "( see @xcite . ) for the suspensions , the kinetic - vibrational partial stress is the viscous stress generated by hydrodynamic forces",
    ". therefore , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the configurational partial stress , and @xmath7 is the total shear rate , common to both the configurational and kinetic - vibrational subsystems .",
    "the notation @xmath8 means that the viscosity @xmath9 is a time - retarded integral operator that becomes a function of frequency after fourier transformation .",
    "the new feature that was introduced in @xcite is that the stz s are characterized by internal barrier heights , say , @xmath10 .",
    "let the number of @xmath3 stz s with given @xmath10 be @xmath11 , and let the total number of ( coarse - grained ) molecular sites be @xmath12 . in the limit of small applied stresses ,",
    "the master equation for @xmath11 is @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 is the rate per stz for transitions between @xmath3 orientations ; it is the origin of the @xmath10 dependence in the theory .",
    "only the partial stress @xmath6 appears as an argument of @xmath15 because the stz s are configurational defects .",
    "@xmath16 is a fundamental time scale , for example , a vibration period for molecular glasses or a brownian diffusion time for colloidal suspensions .",
    "the last two terms on the right - hand side of eq.([ndot ] ) are the rates at which stz s are created and annihilated by spontaneous thermal fluctuations .",
    "we are making a detailed - balance approximation in which @xmath17 is the value approached by @xmath11 in steady - state equilibrium .",
    "@xmath18 is the thermal noise strength , and @xmath19 is the bath temperature in units of energy . mechanically generated noise , which is a prominent ingredient of earlier analyses @xcite , is second order in the applied stress and therefore is negligible in this linear theory .    as usual @xcite ,",
    "define the internal state variables : @xmath20 according to eq.([ndot ] ) , the equations of motion for these variables are @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 ; @xmath23 \\cr \\\\ & - & \\rho(\\theta)\\,m(\\delta ) -{\\tau_0\\,\\dot\\lambda(\\delta)\\over \\lambda(\\delta)}\\,m(\\delta);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath24;\\cr\\\\{\\cal t}(s_c,\\delta)&= & { r(s_c,\\delta ) - r(-s_c,\\delta)\\over r(s_c,\\delta ) + r(-s_c,\\delta)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total rate of plastic deformation is a superposition of terms of the form @xmath25\\cr\\\\ & & = \\epsilon_0\\,\\lambda(\\delta)\\,{\\cal c}(s_c,\\delta)\\bigl[{\\cal t}(s_c,\\delta ) - m(\\delta)\\bigr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the volume of the system , and @xmath27 is a molecular volume that sets the size of the plastic strain increment induced by an stz transition .",
    "we expect @xmath28 to be a number of the order of unity .",
    "most  but not all  of the linear responses of interest here are associated with stz transitions between their internal states .",
    "the exceptions are the last two terms on the right - hand side of eq.([mdot ] ) , which derive from the annihilation and creation terms in eq.([ndot ] ) , and therefore do describe configurational changes . as discussed in earlier papers , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the effective disorder temperature in energy units , and @xmath31 is an stz formation energy that , at this stage of the discussion , may be a @xmath10-dependent quantity .",
    "thus , in eq.([lambdadot ] ) , the rate at which stz s are spontaneously created ( and annihilated ) by thermal fluctuations is proportional to the factor @xmath32 which has the form of an activation rate , with @xmath30 playing the role of the temperature , and @xmath33 being the attempt frequency .    equation ( [ chi - activation ] ) embodies some of the deepest issues in glass physics .",
    "it expresses our contention that the glass transition is intrinsically a dynamic phenomenon , rather than a thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "thus , the formation energy @xmath31 has the magnitude of an ordinary interaction energy ; and the boltzmann factor @xmath34 determines the probability of finding a fluctuation of energy @xmath31 in the configurational subsystem once it has come to equilibrium at temperature @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamic prefactor @xmath18 is a super - arrhenius function of the temperature , associated with the fact that the configurational rearrangements needed to form an stz - like defect involve many - body fluctuations that become increasingly complex and unlikely as the temperature decreases .",
    "( see @xcite for one hypothetical picture of this mechanism . ) accordingly , @xmath18 is approximately equal to unity at temperatures well above the nominal glass temperature @xmath35 , but it becomes very small at lower temperatures .",
    "the system undergoes a dynamically sharp glass transition at some temperature , say , @xmath36 , if  as in the vogel - fulcher - tamann formula",
    " @xmath18 actually vanishes at and below @xmath37 .",
    "the difference between @xmath30 and @xmath38 is a measure of the extent to which the configurational degrees of freedom have fallen out of equilibrium with the heat bath . in the absence of",
    "mechanically generated noise , configurational , i.e. `` structural , '' relaxation is governed by an equation of motion for @xmath30 , which we write in the form @xmath39 here @xmath40 is a dimensionless constant , very roughly of the order of unity , and @xmath41 is a measure of the population of defects , with formation energy @xmath42 , that enable energy transfer from the configurational to the kinetic - vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "the energy @xmath42 should be roughly the same as @xmath31 .",
    "thus , eq.([chidot ] ) describes slow , structural aging during which @xmath30 relaxes toward @xmath38 .    with these assumptions",
    ", we introduce a normalized distribution over barrier heights , @xmath43 , and use eq.([dplastdelta ] ) to write the total rate of plastic deformation in the form @xmath44.\\ ] ] here , because no small factor of the form @xmath45 appears in the prefactor in eq.([lambdadot ] ) , we have assumed that @xmath46 .",
    "then , for simplicity , we have assumed that we can bring the latter factor outside of the integral over @xmath10 in eq.([dplast ] ) , and replace @xmath47 by a single characteristic formation energy @xmath31 .",
    "thus we have written @xmath48    we now need to specify the transition rate @xmath49 . in earlier work @xcite",
    ", we wrote this quantity in the form @xmath50,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath51 was equal to the single barrier height @xmath10 when @xmath52 and became vanishingly small at large , positive @xmath6 . here , with a range of different @xmath10",
    "s , we must recognize that the stress needed to drive the system over a barrier of height @xmath10 must itself be a growing function of @xmath10 .",
    "the simplest such choice is @xmath53 where @xmath27 , needed for dimensional reasons , can be taken to be the same molecular volume introduced in eq.([dplastdelta ] ) , and @xmath54 is a dimensionless number with which we account for the uncertainties in the other parameters .",
    "if the assumptions leading to this equation are correct , then @xmath54 will be roughly equal to unity .",
    "the approximation for @xmath51 in eq.([cald ] ) is physically reasonable and mathematically well behaved except for small @xmath10 , i.e. for high rates , where it will play no role in the analyses to be described here    the prefactor @xmath55 can , in principle , be any symmetric function of @xmath6 .",
    "however , since we are considering only very small values of @xmath6 , this stress dependence is irrelevant . on the other hand , because some stz s are complex objects with many internal degrees of freedom , we anticipate that the attempt frequency @xmath56 depends on both the temperature @xmath38 and the activation barrier @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in analogy to the stz creation - rate formula in eq.([chi - activation ] ) , we write @xmath57 . once again , we presume that the activation barriers @xmath10 are ordinary energies roughly comparable to the formation energies @xmath31 ; but that the rates of thermally assisted passage over these barriers may be substantially decreased by glassy dynamics .",
    "the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath58 is necessary .",
    "we expect that the transitions over small barriers , near @xmath59 , are simple arrhenius processes with @xmath60 . at the other extreme ,",
    "when @xmath10 is large , we expect @xmath58 to be small .",
    "note that the separation of time scales between the configurational and kinetic - vibrational degrees of freedom requires that the internal stz transitions be no slower than configurational rearrangements ; that is , @xmath61 we anticipate that , even if there were a glass transition at a nonzero temperature @xmath37 , the prefactor @xmath62 would remain nonzero for @xmath63 although @xmath18 would vanish .",
    "these understandings about the rate factors allow us to simplify the linearized stz equations of motion . for small @xmath6 , @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "we stress that @xmath66 in eq.([c ] ) describes only ordinary thermally activated processes .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath67 and , in most circumstances , to use @xmath68 as the independent variable instead of @xmath10 .",
    "the barrier heights @xmath10 are energies that characterize the configurational subsystem .",
    "they do not , by themselves , carry dynamic information .",
    "in contrast , when we write equations in terms of @xmath68 , we are building into them a large amount of information about glassy dynamics .",
    "thus , the transformation of variables in eq.([nudef ] ) is an important feature of the following analysis .",
    "we start by assuming that we are dealing with systems that are sufficiently well aged that @xmath75 has approached its equilibrium value , and no longer is changing as a function of time at rates comparable to experimental oscillation periods .",
    "we also assume  nontrivially  that the total shear rate @xmath7 is simply the sum of elastic and plastic parts : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the shear modulus .    denote fourier transforms as functions of frequency @xmath78 by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , etc . ; and let @xmath81 then , @xmath82.\\ ] ] similarly , eq.([gammadot ] ) becomes @xmath83\\ , \\left[\\hat s -i\\,\\omega\\,\\hat\\eta_k(\\omega)\\hat\\gamma\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath84 solving for @xmath85 , we find @xmath86;\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88    to take a first look at these formulas , assume that the kinetic viscosity @xmath9 is negligible at low frequencies , and use eq.([g ] ) to compute the newtonian viscosity associated with configurational deformation : @xmath89 it is easy to check that , when the distribution @xmath90 is sharply peaked at one characteristic value of @xmath68 , this formula reduces to the stz result in eq.(5.4 ) of @xcite .",
    "next , return to the expression for @xmath2 given in eq.([g ] ) , and note that this formula can not naturally be expressed as an average over maxwell modes as in sgr .",
    "this feature is a result of our kinematic assumption in eq.([gammadot ] ) , plus our assumption that the plastic strain rate appearing there is a sum over independent contributions from the different kinds of stz s .",
    "we can deduce immediately from eq.([g ] ) , without yet knowing much about the distribution function @xmath90 , that the low - frequency structure of @xmath2 occurs approximately in the neighborhood of @xmath91 so that @xmath92 is about the same as the viscous relaxation rate .",
    "however , the structure of the @xmath0 peak depends sensitively on the barrier - height distribution , and the approximation made in eq.([omega - alpha ] ) can not replace a full evaluation of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if @xmath90 were concentrated in a narrow band of values near , say , @xmath93 , there would be a relatively narrow peak in @xmath1 at @xmath94 as given by eq.([omega - alpha ] ) , but @xmath2 would have other structure at and above @xmath95 . as will be seen , an anomalously broad @xmath0 peak requires that @xmath90 have an appreciable part of its support starting well below @xmath96 .      at this point , we must begin to discuss the barrier - height distribution @xmath43 .",
    "our starting assumption is that @xmath43 is a near - equilibrium feature of the configurational subsystem . by this , we mean that it is determined by configurational variables , especially the effective temperature , which themselves may be changing in time while the system as a whole moves toward true thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus , we start by considering systems that are fully aged or are aging slowly , and later will see what happens when this assumption fails .",
    "since @xmath10 is measured _ downward _ from some reference energy , it seems natural to postulate , at least for a range of values of @xmath10 , that @xmath43 is an equilibrium distribution of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 is an energy that will be proportional to @xmath30 in simple circumstances . for thermosensitive colloidal suspensions",
    ", however , we expect that @xmath98 will depend on the volume fraction , which itself is a strongly varying function of the bath temperature @xmath38 .",
    "a relation of the form @xmath99 would mean that the distribution of energy barriers becomes broader as @xmath30 increases , consistent with the fact that @xmath30 is a measure of disorder as well as energy . in the limit of small @xmath10 and large @xmath68 , where @xmath100 , the factor @xmath101 in eq.([tilde - p ] ) is equal to @xmath102 , and @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a normalization factor .    in the opposite limit of large @xmath10 and small @xmath68 , integrability of @xmath43",
    "requires that the distribution be cut off for , say , @xmath105 , @xmath106 . to estimate @xmath107 ,",
    "remember that the inequality in eq.([rho0ineq ] ) tells us that the stz transition rates must be faster than the rates at which the stz s are created and annihilated by thermal fluctuations .",
    "it obviously makes no sense to talk about stz transition rates that are slower than the rates at which the stz s themselves are appearing and disappearing .",
    "we therefore propose that @xmath107 be the value of @xmath68 at which this inequality breaks down , i.e. @xmath108    importantly , we do not need to know anything at all about @xmath58 in order to determine @xmath107 from the last expression on the right - hand side of eq.([nu * ] ) .",
    "this relation predicts extremely small values of @xmath107 , which are confirmed by experiments .",
    "the presence of @xmath58 in the intermediate expression simply assures us that we do not have to invoke values of @xmath109 that are unphysically larger than @xmath31 in order to justify small values of @xmath107 .",
    "the cutoff for @xmath105 , @xmath106 can not be infinitely sharp ; therefore , in this region , we propose to write @xmath110 and , equivalently , in the limit of small @xmath68 , @xmath111 here , @xmath112 is an as - yet undetermined energy scale , and we have assumed ( questionably ) that the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath58 is unimportant in this limit . in general , we expect that @xmath113",
    ". a much larger @xmath114  i.e. a much sharper cutoff  would require the configurational energy scale @xmath112 to be smaller than @xmath38 , which seems unphysical .",

    "suppose , further , that the system is truly in equilibrium , so that @xmath126",
    ". then eq.([pnuhigh ] ) implies that @xmath127 .",
    "this parameter `` @xmath125 '' , or one nearly equivalent , has been computed from first principles in mct @xcite .",
    "perhaps this is a place where we can find a direct relation between the stz and mct theories .      in comparing these theoretical results with experimental data ,",
    "we look first at the oscillatory response of structural and metallic glasses , for which @xmath16 is of the order of picoseconds , @xmath128 , and @xmath9 is negligible .",
    "the interesting behavior occurs at temperatures near or slightly above the glass temperature .",

    "these authors show that the functions @xmath2 , for a wide variety of noncrystalline materials at their glass temperatures , have very similar behaviors .",

    "to make approximations for the other parameters in eq.([g ] ) , we note that , if the volume @xmath27 is of the order of a few cubic nanometers , then the ratio @xmath137 , and thus the prefactor in eq.([lambdabar ] ) , is approximately @xmath138",
    ". then , to estimate @xmath139 , we assume that @xmath35 is the same as the steady - state value of the effective temperature , usually denoted by @xmath140 , for systems driven persistently at shear rates much slower than @xmath141 .",

    "because @xmath90 is varying very rapidly near @xmath154 , changing @xmath107 by even a factor of 2 ruins the fit to the data ; and the curves become qualitatively wrong if @xmath107 is changed by an order of magnitude in either direction .",
    "our theoretical curve for @xmath1 in fig.1 is somewhat less smooth than the experimental curve , which may be a result of our overly simple form for @xmath90 in eq.([pnu ] ) .",
    "the other discrepancy is that the experimental storage modulus @xmath155 is approximately linear in @xmath78 at low frequencies , instead of being proportional to @xmath156 as predicted by our theory as well as by maxwell models .",
    "the rheology of soft , colloidal suspensions differs from that of structural and metallic glasses in at least two important respects .",
    "first , in colloidal systems , the approach to jamming near a glass transition is controlled more sensitively by the volume fraction than by the temperature .",
    "second , the microscopically short molecular vibration period in structural glasses is replaced in colloids by the very much longer time scale for brownian motion of the particles . as a result",
    ", the high - frequency cutoff at @xmath153 is probed in rheological experiments , and the kinetic viscosity @xmath157 is relevant at accessibly high values of @xmath78 . when samples are prepared by subjecting them to strong shear stresses , their shear rates become comparable to @xmath141 .",

    "@xcite have reported similar observations about barriers seen in athermal quasi - static simulations .    in the language used here in sec.[oscillatory ] , with the notation introduced in eq.([pnu ] ) for the distribution @xmath90 , the first case discussed by rodney and schuh @xcite resembles the small-@xmath107 distribution at small @xmath30 that we used to describe the oscillatory responses of well aged systems . in their second case",

    "@xcite can be fit reasonably well by using eq.([gamma - t3 ] ) with values of @xmath114 in the range @xmath191 . with only this information",
    ", we might have concluded that these authors were seeing just the @xmath72 relaxation described by eq.([mdot3 ] ) , and not true structural aging in which stz s are created and annihilated . but these authors went further in important ways . after preparing their samples by rapid straining and abrupt unloading",
    ", they allowed the strain to relax at zero stress for various waiting times @xmath192 , and then measured the response to a small step in the stress whose magnitude @xmath193 was much less than the yield stress .",
    "their results are shown here in fig.[step - stress ] .",
    "at least two aspects of these results can be understood only in terms of true structural aging .",
    "first , the initial , instantaneous , elastic increase in the strain , following the stress step , decreased with increasing aging time , indicating that the shear modulus @xmath77 was larger in the older samples .",
    "the shear modulus must be a decreasing function of @xmath30 ( just as it is a decreasing function of the ordinary temperature @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath30  an intrinsically structural variable  decreased during aging .",

    "if eq.([mdot3 ] ) were accurate throughout the aging process  which we will argue is not exactly the case ",

    "the last term tells us that , when @xmath176 is small , this system initially behaves like a conventional yield - stress material ; that is , for small stresses , it fairly quickly becomes jammed with a step - wise , fixed increase in the plastic deformation .",
    "in contrast , the viscous strain proportional to @xmath176 continues to grow linearly in time , and thus can become arbitrarily large .",
    "a crucial point is that each of the terms in eq.([dotgamma - step ] ) is proportional to the aging factor @xmath204 $ ] . for comparisons with experimental data",

    "then , in the limit @xmath206 , eq.([chidot ] ) has the asymptotic solution @xmath207 therefore , apart from the logarithmic correction in eq.([chi - t - approx ] ) , all the terms on the right - hand side of eq.([dotgamma - step ] ) contain the factor @xmath208 for @xmath209 , which is roughly consistent with the observed behavior .",

    "the agreement between theory and experiment seems good ; but , in fact , it is quite problematic .",
    "most obviously , @xmath228 is vastly different from the value @xmath229 that we expect to find in nearly equilibrated systems .",
    "a related problem is that we have assumed that the barrier - height distribution @xmath90 remains fixed during this process ; but @xmath90 is a structural property , and must change during structural aging of the kind implied by decreasing values of @xmath230 .",
    "aging somehow causes the system to make a transformation from its initial , highly disordered state , with a barrier - height distribution characterized by large values of @xmath30 and @xmath107 , to more ordered states with substantially smaller values of those parameters , especially the latter . as yet , we have no theory of how this strongly nonequilibrium process occurs .",
    "we do not know , for example , whether @xmath107 might be a near - equilibrium function of the instantaneous value of @xmath30 , or whether it relaxes toward its near - equilibrium value on some dynamically interesting time scale as happens in @xcite , or whether any such weakly nonequilibrium mechanism is operative .",
    "turn now to the stress - step data in fig.[step - stress ] . for well aged systems such as those for @xmath231 secs .",

    "because of this qualitative change in @xmath90 , there is no reason to expect that the system s orientational memory , carried by the parameter @xmath202 in eq.([dotgamma - step ] ) , retains its original value ; thus we use it as a fitting parameter , and find that it does undergo modest changes during aging .",
    "we have used the following procedure to determine the theoretical parameters for the four cases shown in fig.[step - stress ] . as we did for the strain - recovery curve in fig.[strain - recovery ] , we have computed each of these curves separately by choosing constant values of @xmath176 , @xmath214 , @xmath107 , @xmath116 , @xmath114 , and @xmath202 , rather than trying to guess how these parameters might depend on the time .",
    "we have kept @xmath222 and @xmath223 from the strain - recovery analysis . despite the fact that @xmath107 changes dramatically during the early stages of aging , we have chosen @xmath233 for all four cases .",
    "this relation has a theoretical rationale , and the data does not compel us to choose otherwise  not even for @xmath234 sec .. we looked first at the most fully aged system , with @xmath235 . here , as argued in sec.[oscillatory ] d , we have assumed that @xmath148 .",
    "we then have fit the data by choosing @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 .",
    "this value of @xmath203 must be common to all four curves in fig.[step - stress ] .",
    "for the three other waiting times , the values of the parameters are : for @xmath239 ; for @xmath240 ; for @xmath241 .",
    "as expected , the values of @xmath202 decrease with increasing @xmath192 , but they differ from the value ( @xmath242 ) deduced from the strain - recovery data by less than @xmath243 .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath244 are sensitive to the value of @xmath114 , which seems to increase with increasing @xmath192 .",
    "we see no pattern in the values of @xmath116 , which may be artifacts of our parameterization of @xmath90 or of our parameter - fitting procedure .",
    "they might also be explained by changes in the volume fraction during aging .",
    "there are other experimental uncertainties .",
    "the data shown in fig.5a of @xcite is very noisy . as a result , our estimates of the initial elastic strains in fig.[step - stress ] are uncertain ; and we do not know how seriously to take other discrepancies between theory and experiment at later times .",
    "one systematic theoretical error is that , for the two cases with shorter aging times , the rising viscous strain is too large at the latest times observed .",
    "we have emphasized this behavior in fig.[step - stress ] by extending the time axis an extra decade beyond the data .",
    "the formula for the viscosity in eq.([etan ] ) depends on @xmath90 .",
    "in these cases , @xmath90 has been chosen primarily to fit the earlier stages of the measurements ; thus , it is not surprising that the viscosity is wrong at the later stages .",
    "the most interesting feature of these results is the huge change in @xmath107 that apparently occurs in the first ten seconds or so after unloading .",
    "it appears that the population of stz s with low activation barriers in the strongly disordered inital state disappears quickly ",
    "much more quickly than can be described by near - equilibrium @xmath30 dynamics ",
    "so that these stz s are not available to respond to the only slightly delayed step in the stress at @xmath234 sec .. this observation suggests that , even if we could deduce an equation of motion for @xmath107 , we might not capture essential features of the configurational dynamics in this regime .",
    "we then must ask , if @xmath90 is such a strong function of aging time , why are we able to describe strain recovery with a time - independent @xmath90 ? perhaps the behavior seen at long times in fig.[strain - recovery ] is sensitive only to the population of slow stz s , and perhaps this population remains unchanged by aging during the times of interest .",
    "but such an explanation does not yet provide a basis for developing a predictive theory of these phenomena under far - from - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the analyses described here lead us to a number of conclusions and assertions .",
    "some of these , such as ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) , are shared by sgr and mct , but emerge here in different ways .",
    "others seem to differ more strongly from earlier formulations . + ( 1 ) linear response in glassy systems",
    "is determined by thermally activated processes .",
    "long time scales can be explained , in analogy to structural relaxation in glasses , by super - arrhenius reduction of attempt frequencies as opposed to anomalously high activation barriers .",
    "+ ( 2 ) stz dynamics and kinematics , with a nontrivial barrier - height distribution , produces a non - maxwellian form of the frequency - dependent modulus @xmath2 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the loss modulus @xmath1 automatically has an @xmath0 peak in the neighborhood of the viscous relaxation rate , independent of any specific distribution of barrier heights .",
    "+ ( 4 ) for fully aged or slowly aging systems , the principal features of the stz barrier - height distribution @xmath90 can be determined by assuming that the system is nearly in equilibrium with the current values of various configurational variables , most importantly , with the effective temperature @xmath30 . however , a detailed , first - principles relation between @xmath90 and @xmath30 remains undetermined by the analysis presented here , even for equilibrium situations .",
    "+ ( 5 ) our near - equilibrium analysis of the barrier - height distribution in well aged glassy materials implies that _ any _ such material exhibits an anomalously broad @xmath0 peak near its glass temperature .",
    "metallic and structural glasses , and colloidal suspensions , all share remarkably similar properties in this regard , despite the enormous differences in their underlying time scales and internal dynamics .",
    "+ ( 6 ) some , but not all , of the dynamics of slow processes such as strain recovery can be attributed to internal orientational relaxation , rather than to true structural aging .",
    "+ ( 7 ) true structural aging is characterized by rearrangements of configurational degrees of freedom . in particular ,",
    "the barrier - height distribution must change during structural aging or persistent deformation . at present",
    ", we still need an equation of motion for @xmath90 , perhaps analogous to the sgr equation of motion for the distribution over barrier heights and local strains .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics of the barrier - height distribution is the most important of the issues raised and left unresolved in this paper .",
    "we hope to return to it in the near future .",
    "+ the analyses presented here have not touched on several other topics that often are included in rheological discussions .",
    "for example , we have not discussed stress relaxation in fixed - strain experiments . among the subtle issues that arise in this connection",
    "is that the fourier transform of the stress relaxation function is not necessarily the same as the function @xmath2 defined here .",
    "the difference is that our systems contain relevant internal variables such as @xmath180 and @xmath30 , which relax on the same time scales as the stress , so that conventional theories with history - independent relaxation kernels are inapplicable .",
    "we also have not discussed nonlinear plasticity , because that topic has been the main focus of recent stz theories .",
    "for example , the curves of stress versus strain rate shown by siebenburger et al @xcite for colloidal suspensions are qualitatively similar to those that we have discussed in earlier papers on bulk metallic glasses @xcite .",
    "we believe that we understand those phenomena , and that they are not especially sensitive to the barrier - height distributions .",
    "however , we will need to invoke nonlinear mechanisms to understand the sample - preparation methods used by purnomo et al @xcite .",
    "finally , we have considered only systems in which the ambient thermal noise is non - negligible .",
    "we have not yet extended these ideas to strictly athermal systems such as foams or granular materials",
