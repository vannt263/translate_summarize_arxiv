    "it has been recently shown by loos and gill @xcite that  spherium \" , a system consisting of two electrons trapped on the surface of a sphere and interacting through a coulomb potential , belongs to the family of quasi - exactly solvable quantum mechanical models .",
    "these are models whose schrdinger eigenvalue equation admits an explicit analytical solution for a finite portion of the energy spectrum .",
    "this kind of models are of considerable interest both for illuminating the properties of more complex or realistic systems and for testing and developing approximate treatments , such as those related to density functional theory .",
    "indeed , spherium has found interesting applications in the study of correlated quantum systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "spherium is related to another widely studied semi - solvable two - body model , the hooke atom , which consists of a pair of electrons repelling coulombically and confined by a harmonic external potential ( this system has direct experimental relevance as a model of a two - electron quantum dot with parabolic confinement ) .",
    "here we are going to consider a @xmath1-dimensional version of spherium , where the two electrons are trapped on a @xmath1-sphere of radius @xmath3 . by a @xmath1-sphere we mean the surface of a @xmath2-dimensional ball .",
    "+ exactly solvable and semi - solvable systems provide a valuable arena for the exploration of the entanglement properties of quantum systems of interacting particles .",
    "in particular , they provide useful insights for illuminating the entanglement - related features of natural and artificial atomic systems . unfortunately , there are few such systems where entanglement measures can be evaluated analytically . in point of fact , to the best of our knowledge , the only system of two interacting particles with continuous variables where entanglement has been calculated in an exact analytical way is the moshinsky model @xcite . even for the hooke atom ,",
    "entanglement calculations are based upon the numerical evaluation of rather complex multi - dimensional integrals @xcite .",
    "+ in the present contribution we show that spherium is a highly exceptional model , where the amount of entanglement exhibited by some of its eigenstates can be determined in an exact and fully analytical way . as far as we know , spherium is the only two - body system with coulomb interaction where this goal has been achieved .",
    "+ entanglement is nowadays regarded as one of the most fundamental phenomena in quantum physics @xcite .",
    "entangled states of multipartite quantum systems are endowed with non - classical correlations that give rise to a variegated family of physical phenomena of both fundamental and technological significance .",
    "quantum entanglement can be viewed in two complementary ways .",
    "on the one hand , entanglement constitutes a valuable resource .",
    "the controlled manipulation of entangled states is central to several quantum information technologies . on the other hand",
    ", entanglement can be regarded as a fundamental ingredient for the physical characterization of natural quantum systems such as , for instance , atoms and molecules .",
    "these two points of view are closely related to each other , although the latter is somehow less developed than the former . concerning the second of the approaches mentioned above , several researchers have investigated in recent years the phenomenon of entanglement in two - electron atomic models and related systems @xcite .",
    "most works dealing with entanglement in two - electron systems have been restricted to the associated ground state wavefunctions .",
    "however , the entanglement properties of excited states of two - electron atomic models have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "the most detailed results concerning the entanglement of excited states have been obtained from analytical investigations of exactly soluble models , in particular the moshinsky one @xcite .",
    "+ the main entanglement - related features exhibited by these models share some common trends .",
    "first , one observes that entanglement increases with the strength of the interaction between the particles .",
    "alternatively , for a constant interaction strength , entanglement decreases with the strength of the confining potential ( this behaviour has also been verified in numerical studies of entanglement in helium - like atoms with increasing nuclear charge ) .",
    "these effects are clearly two sides of the same coin , and can usually be described jointly in terms of the dependence of entanglement on an appropriate dimensionless parameter corresponding to the relative strengths of the interaction and the confining potentials . in the case of atomic - like models with an external harmonic confining potential , such as the moshinsky and the hooke ones",
    ", it is also observed that entanglement tends to increase with energy .",
    "this last property hold for the majority of states .",
    "however there are a few entanglement  level - crossings \" where a state has more entanglement than another state of higher energy @xcite . aside from these rare exceptions , the general monotonically increasing behaviour of entanglement with energy has been observed in harmonically confined models endowed with different types of particle interaction ( i.e. , harmonic interaction in the moshinsky system , coulomb interaction in the hooke atom ; and a @xmath4-interaction potential in the crandall model ) .",
    "another trend exhibited by two - electron models with harmonic confinement ( which also holds for different interaction laws between the constituent particles ) is that the amount of entanglement associated with excited states does not always vanish in the limit of a vanishing interaction @xcite .",
    "+ the goal of the present paper is to calculate analytically the amount of entanglement of the ground state of @xmath1-spherium . the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the concept of entanglement in systems consisting of identical fermions . in section iii ,",
    "we show the technical details of the calculations performed in this work . in section iv",
    ", we describe our main results .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section v. +",
    "there is a natural and physically meaningful measure of entanglement for pure states of systems consisting of two identical fermions .",
    "it is based on the schmidt decomposition for fermions @xcite , which reads    @xmath5 is an appropriate orthonormal basis of the single - particle hilbert space , and @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the entanglement of the pure state @xmath8 can then be expressed in terms of the above fermionic schmidt coefficients , as    @xmath9 = 1 - \\sum_{i } \\lambda_{i}^{2 } = 1 - 2\\ , \\text{tr } ( \\rho_{1}^{2}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the single - particle reduced density matrix obtained from the global , two - particle density matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the schmidt coefficients @xmath12 are the eigenvalues ( each one two - fold degenerate ) of @xmath13 . the entanglement measure ( [ eq : e2 ] ) is ( up to appropriate additive and multiplicative constants ) basically given by the linear entropy @xmath14 of the single - particle density matrix @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , one could consider an entanglement measure based upon the von neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath13 , given by @xmath15 .",
    "this last measure is extremely difficult to evaluate analytically for systems with continuous variables . even in the case of the moshinsky model , which is the atomic model where",
    "entanglement has been studied more systematically @xcite , the entanglement measure based on the von neumann entropy has been determined in an exact analytical way only for the ground state @xcite .",
    "it is highly unlikely that in systems with coulomb interactions the entanglement measure based on the von neumannn entropy can be calculated analytically . in these cases",
    "the ( exact ) analytical approach seems basically intractable .",
    "entanglement measures based on the linear entropy have many computational advantages , both from the analytical and the numerical points of view .",
    "in particular , and in contrast with measures based on the von neumann entropy , measures based on the linear entropy can be evaluated directly from @xmath13 , without the need of first determining @xmath13 s eigenvalues .",
    "they constitute a practical tool for assessing the amount of entanglement that has been applied to the study of a variety of systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ an important property of the entanglement measure ( [ eq : e2 ] ) is that correlations between the two particles that are solely due to the antisymmetry of the fermionic state do not contribute to the state s entanglement .",
    "in fact , the amount of entanglement exhibited by a two - fermion state is given , basically , by the quantum correlations that the state has beyond the minimum correlations required by the antisymmetric constraint on the fermionic wavefunction @xcite .",
    "consequently , the entanglement of a pure state of two identical fermions that can be written as a single slater determinant is zero .",
    "+ we apply now the above measure to a pure state of a two - electron system . in order to analyze the entanglement of the eigenstates of spherium we have to consider states described by wavefunctions of the form ,    @xmath16    with the total wavefunction factorized as the product of a coordinate wavefunction @xmath17 and a spin wavefunction @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for the vector positions of the two electrons .",
    "the density matrix corresponding to a wavefunction of the form ( [ eq : e3 ] ) is given by    @xmath21    where the matrix elements of @xmath22 are",
    "@xmath23    even if we are going to investigate the entanglement features only of pure states of spherium , it is conceptually convenient to consider the corresponding density matrix ( proyector ) ( [ eq : e4a ] ) in order to obtain from it the single - particle reduced density matrix , in terms of which the entanglement measure to be used can be clearly formulated . for a state with a wavefunction of the form ( [ eq : e3 ] ) ( and a density matrix of the form ( [ eq : e4a ] ) ) the entanglement measure ( [ eq : e2 ] ) reads ,    @xmath24 & = & 1- 2 \\text{tr } \\left[\\rho_1 ^ 2 \\right ] \\nonumber   \\\\ & = & 1 - 2 \\ , \\text{tr } \\left[\\left ( \\rho_{1}^{(coord . ) }   \\right)^{2 }   \\right ] \\text{tr } \\left[\\left(\\rho_{1}^{(spin ) }    \\right)^{2 } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the single - particle reduced density matrix , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , the marginal density matrices obtained after tracing the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath28 over the degrees of freedom of one of the two particles .",
    "it is clear that the entanglement between the two electrons described by ( [ eq : e3 ] ) involves both the translational and the spin degrees of freedom of electrons .",
    "+ to calculate the entanglement measure ( [ eq : e45 ] ) , it is necessary to consider separately the cases of a spin wavefunction corresponding to parallel spins or antiparallel spins . when spins are parallel ( that is , when the coordinate wavefunction is antisymmetric and the spin wavefunction is either @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) , one has @xmath31 = 1 $ ] , and the entanglement measure ( [ eq : e45 ] ) of a two - electron state of the form ( [ eq : e3 ] ) is    @xmath32 =   1 - 2 \\int |\\langle { \\mathbf{r}}_{1 } ' |\\rho_{1}^{(coord . ) } | { \\mathbf{r}}_{1 } \\rangle |^{2 } \\ , d{\\mathbf{r}}_{1 } ' d{\\mathbf{r}}_{1}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , when the spins are anti - parallel ( when the coordinate wavefunction is symmetric and the spin wavefunction is @xmath33 , or alternatively , when the coordinate wavefunction is antisymmetric and the spin wavefunction is @xmath34 ) , one has @xmath35=\\frac{1}{2}$ ] , and the entanglement is    @xmath36 =   1 -   \\int |\\langle { \\mathbf{r}}_{1 } ' |\\rho_{1}^{(coord . ) } | { \\mathbf{r}}_{1 } \\rangle |^{2 } \\ , d{\\mathbf{r}}_{1 } ' d{\\mathbf{r}}_{1}\\ ] ]    in equations ( [ eq : e5 ] ) and ( [ eq : e6 ] ) we have    @xmath37    for the matrix elements of the _ coordinate _ marginal matrix density .",
    "+ in the above discussion we have considered two - electron states that are separable with respect to the spin and spatial degrees of freedom . moreover , among these states we only considered states where the spin parts of the wavefunction correspond to the standard singlet and triplet states . when studying two - electron systems with a hamiltonian not depending on spin , and energy levels with no degeneracy arising from the spatial part of the hamiltonian , it is standard and natural to focus on eigenstates of the above described forms .",
    "however , even in these cases the spin - independence of the hamiltonian leads to degeneracy of the energy spectra , and to the existence of eigenstates with the spin part of the wavefunction different from the ones just mentioned .",
    "for instance , one can have as spin wavefunction a linear combination of the triplet states .",
    "the corresponding ( global ) eigenstate would have an amount of entanglement different from the ones given by equations ( [ eq : e5]-[eq : e6 ] ) .",
    "but the difference would be due solely to the spin part , and would not correspond to any specific feature of the particular two - electron system under consideration .",
    "if the hamiltonian includes spin - orbit interaction terms , coupling the spin and the spatial degrees of freedom , the situation becomes much more complex .",
    "the eigenstates would not , in general , have the spin and the spatial parts disentangled . in such cases",
    "both types of degrees of freedom need to be considered jointly in order to evaluate the entanglement between the two electrons constituting the system .",
    "these situations are outside the scope of the present work .",
    "the spherium hamiltonian does not depend on spin , and we shall consider only @xmath0-states , where the spatial part of the wavefunction is symmetric , and the spin part is given by the singlet state .",
    "as already mentioned , spherium consists of two identical particles (  electrons \" ) interacting via a coulomb potential and confined to the surface of a @xmath1-sphere of radius @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian , expressed in atomic units , reads ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the interelectronic distance ( a brief review of some basic aspects of the spherium hamiltonian is given in appendix a ) .",
    "@xmath40 states ( @xmath0-states ) have a wavefunction @xmath41 that depends only on the inter - electronic distance .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation can be cast in the form ,    @xmath42 \\frac{d^2\\psi}{du^2 } + \\left[\\frac{u(2d-3)}{4r^2 } - \\frac{d}{u }   \\right ] \\frac{d\\psi}{du } + \\frac{\\psi}{u } = e \\psi,\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 . as was recently proved by loos and gill in @xcite , equation ( [ schroe ] )",
    "admits closed analytical solutions for particular , discrete values of the radius @xmath44 .",
    "these exact eigenfunctions of the spherium system have a polynomial form ,    @xmath45    where the coefficients @xmath46 are determined by the recurrence relation    @xmath47s_{k , m}}{(k+2)(k+(d-1))},\\ ] ]    with the starting values @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the integer parameter @xmath50 has values @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the number of roots that the polynomial ( [ eq : singwav ] ) has in the range @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "that is , the wavefunction ( [ eq : singwav ] ) corresponds to the @xmath52-th excited @xmath0-state .",
    "+ for a given @xmath50 , the energies are obtained by finding the roots of the equation @xmath54 , which is a polynomial in @xmath55 , of degree @xmath56 . the corresponding radius @xmath57 is found through the relation    @xmath58    we see that the special @xmath3-values for which the @xmath0-states of spherium can be obtained in a closely analytical way arise from an expansion of the wavefunction in powers of @xmath59 that , for the mentioned @xmath3-values , becomes a finite polynomial ( for a full discussion see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "of course , the spherium system is well defined for any value of @xmath3 , and the corresponding schrdinger equation can be solved numerically , leading to results that interpolate between those corresponding to the special @xmath3-values yielding analytical solutions .",
    "+ the ( unnormalized ) wavefunction , radius and energy for the ground state ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 are given by    @xmath62    where from now on we have denoted @xmath63 .",

    "this trend is akin with what has been recently observed in other two - electron models @xcite ; see also the recent review @xcite .",
    "in fact , we know from previous experience with two - electron systems that , for a constant strength of the interaction between the particles , entanglement tends to increase when the confinement becomes weaker . this behaviour has been observed in several systems , such as the moshinsky model , the hooke atom , the crandall model , and the helium iso - electronic series @xcite .",

    "this behaviour is consistent with a general property exhibited by other two - electron systems : entanglement tends to increase when , for a given value of the interaction strength , the confinement due to the external common fields acting on both particles decreases .",
    "for instance , in the helium isoelectronic series the entanglement of the ground state increases when one considers decreasing values of the nuclear charge @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "likewise , in the three - dimensional moshinsky model with a uniform magnetic field the entanglement of the ground state increases for decreasing values of the applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "+ the results reported in the present work indicate that in spherium the amount of entanglement exhibited by the ground state decreases with the spatial dimensionality @xmath2 , a behaviour that can also be related to the entanglement - confinement connection .",
