    "the physical characteristics ( shapes , excitation energies , angular momentum , radial flow , ... ) of the hot nuclei formed in nucleus - nucleus collisions are obtained by comparisons between models and data .",
    "statistical decay models are widely used and dedicated to describe the decay of hot fully equilibrated systems , defined as systems having reached energy , shape and isospin equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however other experimental works show strong effects of the entrance channel on the decay modes of the formed hot systems @xcite .",
    "these effects which are not taken into account in the statistical decay models can provide complementary information on the nuclei such as the characteristics of the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite and/or the viscosity of the nuclear matter .",
    "up to now , these entrance channel effects have been studied by tracking deviations from the standard fission process in the quasi - projectile break - up @xcite .",
    "such deviations have been seen on the angular distributions , which show the focusing of the break - up axis along the quasi - projectile velocity direction .",
    "associated with this focusing , highly asymmetrical break - ups have also been observed , whereas symmetrical break - ups were expected .",
    "the corresponding relative velocities were higher than the value predicted by the viola systematics @xcite .",

    ", we present the experimental set - up , the studied sytems and the selections which have been applied on the data . in the second section",
    "the charge distributions , the associated velocity and angular distributions obtained for the different systems are shown .",
    "the third section is devoted to the evolutions of some experimental observables as a function of the break - up asymmetry of the quasi - projectile . in the last section our conclusions",
    "are given .",
    "the experiments were performed at the ganil facility with the indra detector . the different systems which will be presented in this article are ni+ni at 52 and 90 @xmath0 , xe+sn from 39 to 50 @xmath0 , ta+au at 33 and 39 @xmath0 , ta+u at 33 and 39 @xmath0  and u+u at 24 @xmath0 .",

    "we will show afterwards the method used to separate the events corresponding to the uranium target from those corresponding to the carbon backing .",
    "typical beam intensities were 3 - 4 @xmath5 pps .",
    "events were registered when at least four charged particle detectors fired ( eight for the collisions with the ta projectile ) .",
    "the indra detector @xcite can be schematically described as a set of 17 detection rings centered on the beam axis . in each ring",
    "the detection of charged products was provided with two or three detection layers .",
    "the most forward ring , @xmath6 , is made of phoswich detectors ( plastic scintillators ne102 + ne115 ) . between @xmath7 and @xmath8 eight rings",
    "are constituted by three detector layers : ionization chambers , silicon and ics(tl ) . beyond @xmath8 ,",
    "the eight remaining rings are made of double layers : ionization chambers and ics(tl ) .",
    "the total number of detection cells is 336 and the overall geometrical efficiency of indra detector corresponds to 90% of 4@xmath9 .",
    "isotopic separation is achieved up to z=3 - 4 in the last layer ( ics(tl ) ) over the whole angular range ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "a charge resolution of one unit is obtained up to z@xmath1220 .",
    "the energy resolution is about 5% for ics(tl ) and ionization chambers and better than 2% for silicon detectors .     and the velocity component parallel to the beam @xmath14   in the center of mass frame for the ta+au collisions at 39.6 @xmath0  and for events having a total linear momentum greater than 80shading of gray is darker for the high cross sections . ]",
    "the binary character of the collisions is clearly seen on figure [ f : zv ] which plots the correlation between the charge @xmath15 and the velocity component parallel to the beam @xmath14  of each detected fragment .",
    "the fragments are roughly distributed around two areas : one around the quasi - projectile velocity and charge ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and one around the quasi - target velocity ( @xmath18 ) . due to the experimental thresholds ,",
    "the fragments emitted by the quasi - target are not detected efficiently .",
    "then , for this analysis , only the fragments produced by the quasi - projectile are taken into account . due to the quasi symmetry of most of the studied systems , a fragment ( z@xmath193 )",
    "is assumed to be emitted by the quasi - projectile if its velocity component parallel to the beam axis is higher than the velocity of the center of mass @xmath20 .",
    "in order to have enough information to perform our studies , only events for which more than 80% of the incident linear momentum was detected are selected ( @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the charge of the fragment @xmath24 and the charge of the projectile respectively and @xmath25 and @xmath26 their velocity components parallel to the beam axis in the laboratory frame ) .",
    "the events are sorted according to the multiplicity @xmath27   of fragments ( z@xmath193 ) emitted by the quasi - projectile .",
    "the use of a @xmath28 multi - detector gives a very good coverage of the quasi - projectile emissions .",
    "the angular , charge and velocity or energy distributions are precisely obtained .",

    "it will be shown later that this is a powerful tool to distinguish different reaction mechanisms .    as said previously",
    ", the uranium was deposited between two carbon layers .",
    "thus , for the systems with this target , there will be a mixing of reactions on the backing ( c ) and on the target ( u ) .",
    "the separation between these two reactions is done by using the angular distribution of the quasi - projectile . for a fixed incident energy , the grazing angle for the heavy target",

    "one spectacular observation is that the velocity distributions are strongly correlated to the charge sorting : the heaviest fragment is in average the fastest one , the second heaviest fragment is the second fastest one and so on . for the @xmath36  distributions ,",
    "the distribution of the heaviest fragment is peaked at forward angles ( @xmath36@xmath37 ) : the emission direction of this fragment is close to the quasi - projectile velocity direction .",
    "such pictures were not expected in case of a fragmentation of a fully equilibrated quasi - projectile , for which the fragments are emitted in all directions without a particular hierarchy for the velocities .",
    "this hierarchy effect ( the ranking in charge induces on average the ranking in @xmath14   and the @xmath36   distribution of the heaviest fragment is forward - peaked ) suggests an entrance channel effect .",
    "similar results are observed for the corresponding distributions for most of other systems .",
    "the heaviest fragment is the fastest one and its direction of emission is close to the quasi - projectile velocity direction whatever the system size and whatever the incident energy .",
    "the hierarchy between the size of the fragment and its velocity is observed for the ta + au ( figures [ f : hier_taau33 ] and [ f : hier_taau39 ] ) , xe+sn ( figures [ f : hier_xesn39 ] , [ f : hier_xesn45 ] and [ f : hier_xesn50 ] ) and ni+ni systems ( figures [ f : hier_nini52 ] and [ f : hier_nini90 ] ) .",
    "this effect is strong on the ta+au system and is slightly weaker for the xe+sn and the ni+ni systems . for the xe+sn system ,",

    "f : hier_tau33 ] and [ f : hier_tau39 ] ) , the same hierarchy effect is observed as for the ta+au system . for the ta + c , u system ( figures [ f : hier_tau33_all ] and [ f : hier_tau39_all ] ) , this hierarchy effect is still observed for high multiplicities ( @xmath27@xmath38 ) , but is not present for @xmath27=2 .",
    "this is due to the mixing between the carbon backing and the uranium target mentioned in the previous section . for @xmath27=2 ,",
    "the two fragments have almost the same charges , the velocities are similar and the whole range of @xmath36is covered .",
    "the contribution of the ta+c collisions is stronger and stronger when @xmath27  decreases .",
    "this contribution is especially seen for @xmath27=2 ( compare leftmost columns of figures [ f : hier_tau33 ] and [ f : hier_tau33_all ] for 33 @xmath0   and figures [ f : hier_tau39 ] and [ f : hier_tau39_all ] for 39 @xmath0 ) where the distributions are completely different .",
    "the ta+c collisions lead to the formation of an incomplete fusion nucleus , which decays through fission . in this case",
    ", no hierarchy in velocities or no privileged angles of the heaviest fragment are expected .    for the u+u system ( figure [ f : hier_uu24 ] , events with @xmath39 ) the hierarchy effect is observed for @xmath27@xmath40 but is not observed for @xmath27=2 . due to the high fissility of uranium , the @xmath27=2 events correspond mainly to the fission process .",
    "however , events for which the charge of the heaviest fragment is close to 80 are still present .",
    "they correspond to asymmetric binary break - ups which are not expected for the fission of such a heavy nucleus .",
    "these asymmetric break - ups are not present for the u+c system ( figure [ f : hier_uc24 ] , leftmost column , @xmath41 ) and no hierarchy effect is seen : these observations are consistent with the fission of a fully equilibrated nucleus . for @xmath27@xmath40 ,",
    "the velocities of the two heaviest fragments are similar and their @xmath36  distributions are flat . for the other fragments ,",
    "the hierarchy effect is present .",
    "this could be due to a two - step process in which the hierarchy effect is present at the early stage of the collision , followed by the fission of the heaviest fragment due to the high value of its charge .    to summarize this section , a hierarchy effect ( the ranking in charge induces the ranking in @xmath14   and",
    "the @xmath36   distribution of the heaviest fragment is forward - peaked ) is seen for many system sizes and incident energies .",
    "these observations are not consistent with the decay of a fully equilibrated nucleus for which no hierarchy effect is expected .",
    "this `` hierarchy effect '' is consistent with a strong deformation of qp or qt during the collision which is followed by the break - up of these elongated nuclei in two or more fragments ( neck formation and break - up , see figure [ f : schcol ] ) .",
    "the fragments emitted by this neck reflect its internal structure : its size at the center of mass is on average thinner than close to the quasi - projectile or quasi - target , and the velocity modulus in the center of mass frame of the nucleons in the neck close to the center of mass are smaller than those of nucleons close to the quasi - target or to the quasi - projectile .",
    "this leads to the `` hierarchy effect '' observed experimentally .",
    "the velocity gradient can be tracked by studying the relative velocities between the heaviest fragment and the others . in the proposed scenario , this relative velocity is expected to be larger than the one obtained from the decay of a fully equilibrated nucleus . for the heaviest systems , the standard fission process superimposes on the neck formation and break - up .",
    "the two contributions are clearly seen for ta and u projectiles . in these cases , deviations from the standard fission",
    "can be easily tracked .",
    "in the previous section , we have evidenced a `` hierarchy effect '' , indicating a strong entrance channel influence on the fragmentation of the quasi - projectile .",
    "we will study in this section correlations between some observables to verify whether the fragmentation scenario proposed above resists a more detailed analysis .",
    "if an elongated quasi - projectile is formed and breaks quickly , the relative velocities between the fragments should be higher along the qp velocity direction than in any other direction , because the incident energy is not fully damped in internal degrees of freedom in such a process . within this assumption ,",
    "the heaviest fragment focused along the qp velocity has a high velocity because it is a remnant of the projectile . in the case of the fragmentation of a fully equilibrated qp",
    ", the relative velocity should be independent of the break - up direction .    for @xmath27=2 ,",
    "the relative velocity between the two fragments can be easily determined , while it is not the case for higher multiplicities .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the heaviest fragment has the same properties whatever the value of @xmath27 : it is the fastest one and it is focused in the direction of the quasi - projectile in the center of mass frame .",
    "we can use this property to define the break - up direction @xmath42 as the direction of the heaviest fragment with respect to the quasi - projectile velocity , and the relative velocity @xmath43 as the difference of the velocity of the heaviest fragment @xmath44 and the velocity of the center of mass of all other fragments detected with a velocity greater than @xmath20 .",
    "they are determined as follows :    @xmath45    where @xmath22 is the charge of the @xmath46 fragment ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 its velocity    @xmath49 is the velocity of the quasi - projectile .",
    "all the velocities in formulae 1 - 3 are expressed in the center of mass frame . with this definition ,",
    "@xmath42 is identical to @xmath34 of the heaviest fragment ( see figure [ f : angles ] ) .",
    "let us study the behaviour of the @xmath51   distributions .",
    "the experimental distributions are shown on figures [ f : asctp_taau33 ] and [ f : asctp_taau39 ] for the ta + au system at 33 and 39.6 @xmath0  respectively . on each figure",
    ", the columns correspond to different values of @xmath27   and the rows to different ranges in charge of the heaviest detected fragment @xmath52 .",
    "this cut in @xmath52 was done due to the particular behavior of the heaviest fragment .",
    "it is also correlated to the asymmetry of the break - up as in fission : the highest values of @xmath52 correspond to the more asymmetric break - ups ( one big fragment and small other ones ) and the lowest values of @xmath52 correspond to the most symmetric break - ups ( equal size fragments ) .",
    "it can be seen on these figures that the @xmath51   distributions are in most cases peaked at 1 ( emission along the direction of the qp velocity ) .",
    "the most forward peaked @xmath51   distributions are obtained for the most asymmetric break - ups ( high values of @xmath52 ) and this for all values of @xmath27 .",
    "this is not expected in the case of a fragmentation of a fully equilibrated nucleus .",
    "an angular momentum effect would lead to a forward - backward symmetry in angular distributions .",
    "for the most symmetric break - ups ( low values of @xmath52 ) and the greater imf multiplicities , the distribution becomes less forward peaked . in this case , the fragments having almost the same charge , the ranking in charge is meaningless .",
    "consequently the memory of the direction of the qp in the fragmentation process is blurred .",
    "another possible scenario could be the occurrence of the fragmentation of a fully equilibrated qp .",
    "it will be seen later that the cut at @xmath20can also influence these distributions .",

    "is there a connexion between the strength of the anisotropy of the @xmath51   distributions and the violence of the collisions ?",
    "the latter has been estimated by using the sum of the transverse energies @xmath53   of light charge particles ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this global variable has been widely used as an impact parameter selector in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the low values of transverse energies correspond to peripheral collisions and the high values to the most violent collisions .",
    "the reduced transverse energy distributions ( @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the energy available in the center of mass ) are presented in figure [ f : aset12_taau39 ] for ta+au collisions at 39.6 @xmath0 .",
    "the shapes of these distributions depend weakly on the value of @xmath27   and strongly on that of @xmath52 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xmath57 being the remnant of the qp .",
    "the average @xmath53   value decreases when going from symmetrical ( first row ) to asymmetrical break - ups ( last row ) as already shown for the lighter ar+ni system @xcite .",
    "the last row corresponds to the most asymmetrical and aligned break - ups ( see figure [ f : asctp_taau39 ] ) .",
    "the transverse energies of the associated particles are low and correspond to peripheral collisions .",

    "this observation , combined with the `` hierarchy effect '' and the strongly peaked @xmath51   distributions , strongly suggests that these fragmentations are only due to entrance channel effects .",

    "the agreement between data and simulation is good , showing that the velocity cut limits the range of accessible @xmath59   values . for higher @xmath27   values ,",
    "similar conclusions are obtained .",
    "another interesting observation is that the @xmath59   distribution for @xmath51@xmath71 is narrow , its average value @xmath59@xmath72 corresponds to the viola systematics @xcite and is not affected by the velocity cut at @xmath20 . when @xmath51   increases , the width of the @xmath59   distribution and its average value increase while the velocity cut has no influence , i.e. for @xmath51   values below 0.8 . above @xmath51=0.8 , high values of @xmath59",
    "can not be reached and then its average value decreases .",
    "for the u+c system rightmost column , it can be seen that the @xmath59   distributions are always narrow and centered around the viola systematics value whatever the @xmath51   value . for these collisions",
    ", our experimental cut does not affect the evolutions of @xmath59   with @xmath51 .",
    "the observations made in this section confirm the scenario proposed in the previous section . for the u+c system ,",
    "all observations are compatible with the decay of a fully equilibrated nucleus : no modulation of @xmath59   with @xmath51   is seen while at the same time the `` hierarchy effect '' is absent or very weak . for the systems with a heavy target , the variation of @xmath59   with @xmath51",
    "is observed .",
    "this indicates that a strongly deformed qp or a neck of matter is formed at the early stage of the collision , and breaks quickly into several fragments .",
    "in such a process , the incident kinetic energy is not fully damped , and the fragments keep the memory of the formation of the neck and/or deformed qp . within this interpretation ,",
    "the heaviest fragment is a remnant of the projectile .",
    "this scenario seems to occur for a wide range of system size and incident energies .",
    "for the heaviest systems , like u+u for which the fissility of the qp is high , it competes with the fission process .",
    "the study of the parallel velocity distributions of the fragments forward emitted as a function of their charge exhibits a `` hierarchy effect '' : the ranking in charge induces in average a ranking in the average parallel velocity , the heaviest fragment is the fastest and is focused in the forward direction relative to the qp recoil velocity .",
    "this `` hierarchy effect '' is stronger when the size of the target is large , when the fissility of the qp is limited ( @xmath73 ) and when the incident energy is high .",
    "this effect is observed for all systems , whatever the multiplicity of fragments .",
    "these observations are compatible with the formation of a neck of matter in - between the quasi - projectile and the quasi - target",
    ". the neck may be or not attached to the qp ( or qt ) remnant . in any case , its break - up is fast enough to keep the memory of the entrance channel .",
    "this mechanism is predominant for asymmetric break - ups which mainly correspond to peripheral collisions . for the most peripheral collisions , the asymmetry observed for the binary break - ups",
    "is not compatible with the result of a standard fission , and for the highest multiplicities , the high focusing of the heaviest fragment at forward angles is inconsistent with the fragmentation of a fully equilibrated nucleus .",
    "the observed variation of the fragments relative velocity with the emission angle of the heaviest fragment strenghtens the previous statement .",
    "this internal correlation study is a powerful tool to clearly establish the degree of equilibration of the studied ensemble . up to now , the comparisons of models to data were mainly made on global observations only ( size distributions , multiplicity distributions , kinetic energy distributions , and so on ... ) .",
    "the study of such internal correlations is a more accurate tool to test the pertinence of the models .    in order to have a full understanding of the fragmentation process",
    ", the models have to reproduce the effects of the entrance channel .",
    "a first step could be to mock up these effects in effective parameters in the statistical decay approaches",
    ". it will be certainly worth to use dynamical approaches @xcite to test the presence of such a hierarchy effect .",
    "but in all cases , the models have to reproduce the global observations and the internal correlations as well ."
