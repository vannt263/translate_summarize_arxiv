    "it is observed to display a `` pseudo - crab '' morphology ( van der bergh 1979 ; bgcr86 ) , while its x - ray morphology as shown by _ einstein _ ( tuohy , burton , & clark 1982 ) is confined to a center - filled `` bar '' , which is resolved by _",
    "chandra _ as a filamentary band across the entire remnant .",
    "recent _ chandra _ data of  have revealed two intriguing point sources .",
    "the first is a faint , non - thermal object that is probably not associated with the remnant .",
    "the second source is a hard point source just below the central bar in , offset to the southeast of the center of the remnant .",
    "the location of this object corresponds to the contour of highest radio surface brightness ( bgcr86 ) , corresponding to a surface brightness of 1.08 jybeam@xmath6 at 843 mhz .",
    "due to the low angular resolution of previous x - ray observations and the proximity of the point sources to a filament of the central bar , it is not surprising that these objects were only detected with the high angular resolution of _",
    "chandra_.    we present images and spectra of the point sources in the snr , arguing that the brighter source is a neutron star that is physically associated with the remnant .",

    "the archival data were regained with caldb v.2.3 and ciao v.2.1.1 according to standard data processing procedures .",
    "a bright point source was detected at coordinates ( j2000 ) @xmath0=11@xmath124@xmath239@xmath3 , @xmath4=-591619.8 , which we have designated cxouj112439 - 591619 .",
    "this source contains approximately 4500 counts and is spread approximately normally in a `` circle '' of 4.75pixel=2.37  radius .",
    "a possible explanation for the partially - diffuse nature of the source is that there is a synchrotron pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around a neutron star , though there is no obvious morphological evidence of a bow - shock or synchrotron tail due to a high space velocity of the neutron star .",
    "this possibility is discussed further in the following sections .",
    "images were extracted of the entire remnant in the `` soft '' ( 0.1 - 1.1 kev ) and `` hard '' ( 1.1 - 10.0 kev ) energy ranges ( fig [ fig : remnant ] ) , with close - up images surrounding the source included ( figure [ fig : zoom ] ) .",
    "this particular range for the soft band was chosen based off of the knowledge that neutron stars primarily emit soft , thermal x - rays in this range ( page 1995 ; zavlin _ et al . _",
    "this object is particularly visible in the hard band image , which contains almost two - thirds of the total detected counts from the source .",
    "hardness ratio maps ( hard image / soft image ) were constructed , in which the point source stands out dramatically from the surrounding remnant ( figure [ fig : ratio ] ) .    also standing out in the hardness ratio maps",

    "the softest channel was ignored , the pi channels were binned by a factor of 16 , and the channels corresponding to energies above 8.0kev were ignored to insure that there were at least 10counts per bin .",

    "we also subtracted a background annulus of 23  outer radius and identical inner radius to the nebula ( 2.5 ) as background .",
    "the shapes of the inner circle and outer annulus spectra were similar , with prominent spectral features above 3.0kev in the annulus spectrum ( fig [ fig : spec ] ,  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "a thorough discussion of the nebula spectrum seems to be unwarranted at this time , though we have included the inner circle spectrum in figure [ fig : spec ] and table [ tab : spec ] for comparison with our original fit of the r=2.37  spectrum .",
    "a variety of spectral models were fit to the point source spectrum in an attempt to find the most physically and statistically viable model of the emission .",
    "the results of these spectral fits are summarized in table [ tab : spec ] .",
    "the three - component spectral model blackbody radii correspond to luminosities of l@xmath39=3.5@xmath40d@xmath41ergs@xmath6 and l@xmath42=5.9@xmath43d@xmath41ergs@xmath6 , respectively , where d@xmath44 is the distance to  in units of 3.6kpc .",

    "we note that this value of l@xmath45 could be as high as 1.6@xmath48ergs@xmath6 or as low as 2.6@xmath40ergs@xmath6 given the error bars on d. plots of the compact source spectrum and the inner source spectrum mentioned above are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "a spectrum of the fainter point source did not contain enough counts to provide a statistically unique fit .",
    "it is clear that the emission is almost entirely high - energy ( @xmath491.1kev ) , and shows evidence of emission and absorption lines above 2.0kev .",
    "it is statistically fit with a comparable column density to those found for the bright source and a power - law of photon index @xmath50=1.2 .",
    "thermal models are excluded on both statistical and spectral grounds , as we find it difficult to believe that such exclusively hard emission could be originating from a thermal source .",
    "blackbody , raymond - smith , vpshock , nei , and sedov absorbed models either do not succeed in statistically fitting the spectrum , or require disturbingly high temperatures on the order of kt@xmath1350 - 70kev .",
    "the bright point source in  appears to be one of a growing number of neutron star / supernova remnant associations ( helfand 1998 ) , further study of which may ultimately provide us with clues as to how the composition of progenitor stars and circumstellar material contribute to the evolution of neutron stars ( e.g. marsden _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) , and perhaps why these systems exist in such low abundance .",
    "the fact that _ chandra _ has begun to reveal a number of such point sources in supernova remnants ( e.g. chakrabarty _ et al . _  2001",
    "; olbert _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) may indicate that the lack of neutron star / snr associations is at least partly instrumental .    though the point source spectrum is statistically fit ( @xmath511 ) by power - law , blackbody plus power - law , and two blackbody plus power - law models",
    ", we argue that the latter is the most physically viable model .",
    "we assert that the lower temperature kt=0.16kev ( logt=6.27k ) and larger blackbody radius represents the characteristic temperature of a significant fraction of the neutron star surface or atmosphere ( nominally , @xmath135% , though this is extremely dependent on temperature and temperature distribution ) .",
    "this temperature is consistent with surface temperatures predicted by standard cooling models ( e.g. page 1995 ; page & sarmiento 1996 ) , and is twice as high as the average effective temperature of other neutron stars ( slane & lloyd 1995 ) .",
    "however , the possibility of non - thermal continuum emission can not be statistically ruled out at this time .",
    "the second , higher temperature of kt=0.50kev and smaller blackbody radius could correspond to emission from a hot polar cap or a `` hot spot '' on either the surface or atmosphere due to temperature anisotropy resulting from internal convection or magnetic effects ( e.g. greenstein & hartke 1983 ; pavlov _ et al . _",
    "if this is true , these data indicate that the luminosity contribution of small , hot regions of a neutron star is nearly as high as that of the rest of the emitting area .",
    "given the luminous nature of the source , it may be fruitful to search for thermal pulses in the 0.1 - 1.1kev band ( pavlov _ et al . _",
    "1994 ; page 1995 ; zavlin _ et al . _",
    "we attribute the power - law component to non - thermal synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by the high dipolar surface field of the neutron star . alternatively",
    ", a distribution of temperatures could be causing a power - law spectrum , though if this were the case , our spectrum of the reduced radius source would not require a more significant blackbody component and a less significant power - law component , which our spectral fits indicate it does ( see [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "a final intriguing feature of the compact object spectrum is the presence of spectral features above 3.0kev",
    ". lines at 3.0 - 3.1kev and above 7.0kev seem to correspond to highly ionized argon and iron , though they could also be due to background emission from the snr itself that was not successfully subtracted .",
    "interestingly , if one extracts a spectrum of 0.5  radius instead of 2.37 , high - energy features become noticeably different ( see figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "this may indicate the presence of heavy elements being ionized in the outer atmosphere or nebula of the neutron star .",
    "we can estimate the object s transverse velocity assuming that the neutron star received a kinetic `` kick '' from the initial supernova explosion and has traveled ballistically to its current location .",
    "image of  indicates a radius of @xmath52250 , which corresponds to a radius of @xmath524.3d@xmath41@xmath53pc , where @xmath54 is the age of the remnant in terms of kiloyears ( we adopt @xmath551 : bgcr86 ) .",
    "an estimate of the object s offset from the blast center ( either geometric or from bgcr86 ) yields 60@xmath5620 , and therefore a transverse velocity of @xmath57d@xmath41@xmath58@xmath59kms@xmath6 , where @xmath59 is the object s angular distance from the blast center in terms of 60 .",
    "this is likely an upper limit , since spherical asymmetry probably places the blast center closer to the object .",
    "also , the presence of large - scale density gradients could alter this result ( e.g. dohm - palmer & jones 1996 ; hnatyk & petruk 1999 ) .",
    "though kick velocities of this magnitude are not unheard of , recent studies indicate that the mean kick velocity of neutron stars is about a fourth of this number ( hansen & phinney , 1997 ) .",
    "this may indicate that the remnant is older than 1,000 years , perhaps having an age closer to the 2300yr derived by agrawal & riegler ( 1979 ) or even older .",
    "another possibility is that the remnant is closer than we have assumed . without vlbi resolution",
    ", a proper motion study seems unlikely to resolve this issue until anytime soon , since an age of 1,000 years corresponds to a velocity of 0.06yr@xmath6 .",
    "though the spatial features of the compact object and its surroundings provide little evidence for a bow - shock and synchrotron tail , and the spectral analysis to the same effect is ambiguous , it is nevertheless reasonable to presume that the extended region around the point source is in fact a synchrotron nebula .",
    "evidence of such a nebula includes the hard nature of the source ( e.g. figures [ fig : remnant ] , [ fig : ratio ] ) , the spectral fits ( figure [ fig : spec ] ,  [ sec : spec ] ) , and the diffuse nature of the compact source .",
    "the previously derived value of l@xmath45 gives a spin - down power of the neutron star @xmath60=4.0@xmath61ergs@xmath6 ( seward & wang 1988 ) .",
    "we can estimate a radio luminosity l@xmath62 given that the source is a 1.08 jybeam@xmath6 source at 843 mhz with a spectral index of -0.37 , assuming that this object is the cause of the highest radio surface brightness on bgcr86 s most map , to which it is coincidental . integrating this spectrum from 10 mhz to 100 ghz",
    ", we derive a radio luminosity of l@xmath63d@xmath44ergs@xmath6 .",
    "assuming that @xmath64l@xmath62 ( frail & scharringhausen 1997 ; gaensler _ et al . _  2000",
    ") , our value of l@xmath62 gives @xmath65ergs@xmath6 .",
    "we adopt @xmath60=@xmath66ergs@xmath6 , well in the range of other young neutron stars ( see becker & pavlov 2001 ) and other neutron stars with surrounding pwne ( e.g. predehl & kulkarni 1994 ; frail _ et al . _  1996",
    "; olbert _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) .",
    "all @xmath67-ray emitting pulsars have ratios of @xmath68d@xmath690.5 ( nel _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , where @xmath68 is @xmath60 in terms of 10@xmath70 ergs@xmath6 , and so we suggest that it is plausible that this object is such a @xmath67-ray source ( for our derived @xmath60 , this ratio is approximately 100 times greater than the flux threshold of 0.5 ) .    as a final note ,",
    "we interpret the faint , hard point source to the northwest of the asserted neutron star as a bright background object , perhaps an x - ray binary system .",
    "we have shown archival _",
    "chandra _ x - ray images and spectra of the supernova remnant .",
    "these data have revealed a hard , bright x - ray point source at coordinates ( j2000 ) @xmath0=11@xmath124@xmath239@xmath3 , @xmath4=-591619.8 , which we have interpreted as an isolated neutron star that is physically associated with the remnant .",
    "we have argued for a spectral model that includes one non - thermal and two thermal components , and have obtained values similar to those of other neutron stars .",
    "likewise , the observed x - ray and radio luminosities and derived spin - down energy @xmath60 are similarly consistent with other known neutron stars ( e.g. frail & kulkarni 1991 ; olbert _ et al . _",
    "we also assert that the diffuse nature of the compact source ( angular radius@xmath132.5 ) can be explained by the presence of a synchrotron wind nebula around the source ( frail & kulkarni 1991 ; frail _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) .",
    "this object has presented a few problems that remain to be explained .",
    "first of all , the spectrally derived radius of the object is an order of magnitude smaller than canonical values .",
    "also , our attempts to spatially or spectrally distinguish a synchrotron pulsar wind nebula have been ambiguous , though future observations of the object may resolve this issue .",
    "lastly , an estimate of the transverse velocity of the object is significantly higher than the mean transverse velocity , though velocities of this magnitude are not unheard of .",
    "altogether , as with other new neutron star / snr systems , the observation of such systems pose more questions than they are able to answer ."
