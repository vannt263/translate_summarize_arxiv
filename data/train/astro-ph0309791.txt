    "it is well known that the radio emission from clusters of galaxies generally originates from individual radio emitting galaxies . in addition , some clusters of galaxies show synchrotron emission not directly associated with a particular galaxy but rather diffused into the intra  cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "these diffuse radio sources , which are the most spectacular probe of the existence on non  thermal emission from the icm , have been classified in three classes : cluster  wide halos , relics and mini ",
    "halos @xcite .",
    "both cluster  wide halos and relics have low surface brightness , large size ( @xmath1 1 mpc ) and steep spectrum , but the former are located at the cluster centers and show low or negligible polarized emission , while the latter are located at the cluster peripheries and are highly polarized . the diffuse radio emission is found in clusters which show significant evidence for an ongoing merger ( e.g. , @xcite 1992 ; @xcite 2002 ) .",
    "it was proposed that recent cluster mergers may play an important role in the re  acceleration of the radio  emitting relativistic particles , thus providing the energy to these extended sources ( e.g. , @xcite 1993 ; @xcite 2001 ) .",
    "the merger picture is consistent with the occurrence of large  scale radio halos in clusters without a cooling flow , since the major merger event is expected to disrupt a cooling flow ( e.g. , @xcite 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "halos are diffuse radio sources , extended on a smaller scale ( up to @xmath2 kpc ) , surrounding a dominant radio galaxy at the cluster center .",
    "they are only observed in clusters with a cooling flow and it has been found that these sources are not connected to ongoing cluster merger activity .",
    "their radio emission is indicative of the presence of diffuse relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the icm , since these sources do not appear as extended lobes maintained by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , as in classical radio galaxies @xcite .    more specifically , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gbs ) suggested that the diffuse synchrotron emission from radio mini  halos is due to a relic population of relativistic electrons re  accelerated by mhd turbulence _ via _ fermi  like processes , with the necessary energetics supplied by the cooling flow .",
    "very recently , the alternative possibility of hadronic origin for radio mini ",
    "halos has also been discussed @xcite .    here , we present the application of gbs s model to radio mini ",
    "halo candidates and discuss the observational properties of the population of radio mini  halos .    in particular , in sect .",
    "2 we briefly review gbs s model , in sect .",
    "3 we present the application of the model to the perseus cluster and to the new mini ",
    "halo candidate a2626 , and discuss the results . in sect .",
    "4 we present the observational properties of radio mini ",
    "halo candidates in relation to those of host clusters .    a hubble constant @xmath3 is assumed .",
    "the radio spectral index @xmath4 is defined such as @xmath5 and , where not specified , all the formulae are in cgs system .",
    "the spatial extension of the diffuse radio emission from mini ",
    "halos represents a serious problem for understanding the origin of these sources .",
    "the radiative lifetime of an ensemble of relativistic electrons losing energy by synchrotron emission and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off the cmb photons is given by : @xmath6 }   \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\mbox{yr}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the magnetic field intensity ( in g ) , @xmath8 is the lorentz factor and @xmath9 g is the magnetic field equivalent to the cmb . in a cooling flow region ( i.e. for distances @xmath10 , the cooling radius ) the compression of the thermal icm is expected to produce a significant increase of the strength of the frozen  in cluster magnetic field and consequently of the electron radiative losses .",
    "therefore , in the absence of a re  acceleration or continuous injection mechanisms , relativistic electrons injected at a given time in these strong fields ( of order of 10 - 20 @xmath11 g , @xcite 1993 ; @xcite 2002 ) should already have lost most of their energy and the radio emission would not be observable for more than @xmath12 - @xmath13 yr .",
    "such a radiative lifetime is orders of magnitude shorter than the characteristic diffusion time necessary for the radio  emitting electrons to cover the distance on which the diffuse radio emission from mini ",
    "halos is observed , therefore it is plausible that some re  acceleration mechanisms able to balance the radiative losses and modify the electron energy spectrum is acting .    in order to evaluate the radiative losses in the cooling flow region at any distance from the cluster center it is necessary to parameterize the radial dependence of the field strength , which depends on the compression of the thermal gas in the cooling region ( i.e. , on @xmath14 ,",
    "@xmath15 being the cooling radius ) .",
    "on the one hand , the x  ray emission and the spectra of cooling flow clusters unavoidably show the increase of the gas density and the decrease of the temperature towards the center of these clusters .",
    "on the other hand , _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ observations have pointed out that the mass deposition rates in cooling flows have been overestimated in the past by a factor 5 - 10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ; the new mass deposition rates are not too different from the masses of cold gas estimated by the recent iram observations ( @xcite 2001 ; @xcite 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , high spectral resolution observations with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on _ xmm  newton _ do not show evidence for gas cooling at temperature lower than 1 - 2 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all these studies basically confirm the idea that the gas cools and thus it results compressed in the central region of the cooling cores , but on the other hand they also point out that the physics of the icm in these regions is more complex than that described by the standard cooling flow models .",
    "unfortunately , no successful model in alternative to the standard model has been proposed yet , therefore , as a first approximation in our model calculations , we will evaluate the radial behaviour of the physical quantities in the icm making use of the standard - single phase - cooling flow model .    in the framework of this model , the increase of the strength of the frozen  in cluster magnetic field is @xmath16 for radial compression @xcite or @xmath17 for isotropic compression @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the energy of a relativistic electron in these regions is determined by the competing processes of losses and re  accelerations ( both related to the magnetic field ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the coefficient of synchrotron and ic losses , @xmath21 the re  acceleration coefficient and @xmath22 the coulomb loss term .",
    "the main assumption of gbs s model is that a relic population of relativistic electrons ( originated for example in a central active galaxy and then spread throughout the whole cooling flow region by diffusion in few gyr ) as well as a seed large ",
    "scale turbulence ( naturally originated in the icm for example as a result of past merger events or motion of the galaxies in the cluster , or due to the interaction of the radio lobes of the central galaxy with the cooling flow itself ) , are present in the cooling flow region , and that the relic electrons can be efficiently re  accelerated via fermi  like processes by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence amplified by the compression of the magnetic field in the cooling flow region .",
    "however , the turbulence must not be too high in order to avoid the disruption of the cooling flow : this fine  tuning of the turbulent energy could explain , at least qualitatively , the rarity of these radio sources .",
    "in the present paper , we consider a coefficient for systematic re  acceleration given by @xcite : @xmath23 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath25 is the characteristic mhd turbulence scale . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath26 .",
    "the energy at which the losses are balanced by the re  acceleration , @xmath27 , is obtained by eq .",
    "[ gitti : gammapunto.eq ] and , since coulomb losses are nearly negligible at such electron energies , it is @xmath28 .    under these assumptions , the stationary spectrum of the relativistic electrons",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath29 which is essentially peaked at @xmath27 and where the electron energy density has been parameterized as @xmath30 , @xmath31 being a free parameter .",
    "the other free parameters are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in this section we will present the application of gbs s model to the prototype of the mini ",
    "halo source class , the perseus cluster , and a new mini  halo candidate , abell 2626 , and discuss the physical implications of the results .",
    "we believe that the most striking evidence for electron re  acceleration in cooling flows is the case of the perseus cluster ( a426 , z=0.0183 ) . the diffuse radio emission from the mini  halo ( see left panel in fig .",
    "[ gitti : perseus.fig ] ) has a total extension of @xmath34 ( at the redshift of the cluster @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath36 kpc ) and its morphology is correlated with that of the cooling flow x - ray map ( @xcite 1993 ; @xcite 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the mini  halo show a very steep spectrum ( the integrated spectral index between @xmath37 mhz and @xmath38 mhz is @xmath39 , @xcite 1993 ) which steepens with distance from the center ( see fig . [ gitti : perseus_irr.fig ] ) .    on smaller scales ( @xmath40 ) , there is evidence of interaction between the radio lobes of the central radiogalaxy 3c84 and the x  ray emitting intra ",
    "cluster gas ( e.g. , @xcite 1993 ; @xcite 2000 ; see fig .",
    "[ gitti : perseus.fig ] , right panel ) .",
    "a recent interpretation is that the holes in the x  ray emission are due to buoyant radio lobes which are currently expanding subsonically @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the spectral index in these lobes ranges from @xmath41 in the center to @xmath42 in the outer regions @xcite , which is a value similar to the spectrum of the mini  halo extended over a scale @xmath43 times larger .",
    "thus it is difficult to find a direct connection between the radio lobes and the mini ",
    "halo in terms of simple particle diffusion or buoyancy as , in this case , the diffusion time is considerably greater than the radiative lifetime of the radio electrons , while adiabatic losses during the expansion would cause a very rapid steepening of the spectrum preventing the detection of large  scale radio emission .",
    "thus , by assuming a primary origin for relativistic electrons in radio mini  halos , efficient re  acceleration mechanisms in the cooling flow region are necessary to explain the presence of the large  scale radio emission in fig .",
    "[ gitti : perseus.fig ] .",
    "the cluster a2626 hosts a relatively strong cooling flow @xcite and contains an amorphous radio source near to the center ( @xcite 1985 ; @xcite 1990 ) which is extended on a scale comparable to that of the cooling flow region with an elongation coincident with the x  ray distribution @xcite .    in order to extend the application of gbs s model to this cluster ,",
    "we have requested and analyzed some of the vla archive data of a2626 with the aim to derive the surface brightness map , the total spectral index and the spectral index distribution of the diffuse radio emission .",
    "standard data reduction was done using the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) aips package . in particular",
    ", we produced a 1.5 ghz map of the diffuse radio emission after subtraction of the central discrete source ( fig .",
    "[ gitti : a2626halo.fig ] ) . to be conservative , the region in which the surface brightness is affected by the subtraction procedure ( within the dashed circle in fig .",
    "[ gitti : a2626halo.fig ] ) has not been considered in the application of gbs s model .",
    "the integrated spectral index of the diffuse emission between @xmath44 mhz and @xmath45 ghz is @xmath46 . by studying the spectral index distribution we found that , as in the case of perseus",
    ", the diffuse radio emission shows a steep spectral index which steepens with the distance from the center ( see fig .",

    "[ gitti : mymodel.sec ] , it is worth noticing that new _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ results obtained for a limited number of objects hint to an overestimate of @xmath0 derived by earlier observations : in particular , the consensus reached in these studies ( e.g. , @xcite 2000 ; @xcite 2001 ; @xcite 2001 ; @xcite 2001 ; @xcite 2001 ; @xcite 2003 ) is that the spectroscopically  derived cooling rates are a factor @xmath1 5 - 10 less than earlier _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this factor seems to be similar for all clusters in a large range of @xmath0 , giving a systematic effect that will not spoil the correlation reported in fig .",
    "[ gitti : correlazione.fig ] .",
    "we can conclude that even by considering reduced spectroscopically  derived @xmath0 , the cooling flow powers are well above the radio powers emitted by mini  halos , therefore even if the cooling flow was partially re  heated and stopped , the basic idea and results of the model would not change .    m.g . would like to thank f. brighenti for stimulating discussion during the conference and s. dallosso for his constant help and insightful comments .",
