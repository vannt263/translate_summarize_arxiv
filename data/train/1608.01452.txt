    "weyl - orbit functions @xcite have been defined for all simple lie algebras @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the rank , and @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) .",
    "they give rise to various fourier - like analyses of data on the fundamental region @xmath7 of the corresponding affine weyl groups . for the purposes of this introduction",
    ", we will not distinguish between the fundamental region @xmath7 and related regions @xmath8  see sect .  3 and eqn .  ( [ fsflex ] ) .",
    "discretized versions have been studied for the analysis of digitized data on the same fundamental region .",
    "the digitization is controlled by a positive integer @xmath9 , which can be considered the resolution .",
    "the discretized weyl - orbit functions @xcite have as their domain a fragment @xmath10 of the lattice @xmath11 in @xmath7 , where @xmath12 is the coweight lattice of @xmath3 .",
    "let us call @xmath13 a @xmath14-fragment of @xmath7 . for fixed @xmath9 , a set of weyl orbits can be specified such that the associated discretized weyl - orbit functions are pairwise orthogonal @xcite .",
    "their number equals the number of points in the fragment @xmath10 .",
    "the dominant - weight representatives of the weyl orbits fill out a @xmath15-fragment of the @xmath9-dilation of @xmath16 , the fundamental region of the _ dual _ affine weyl group associated with @xmath3 .",
    "the properties of the orbit functions have been intensively investigated @xcite , including their discretizations @xcite .",
    "recently , a remarkable similarity was noticed between one class of discretized orbit functions with important objects in conformal field theory @xcite ( see eqn .",
    "( 27 ) therein ) .",
    "specifically , the modular @xmath0-matrix of the wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wznw ) conformal field theories , first written by kac and peterson @xcite , involves an alternating sum over the weyl orbit of a dominant weight , as does the so - called @xmath0-function . in @xcite ,",
    "this similarity was exploited by using known attributes of the kac - peterson matrices to uncover new , analogous properties of the discretized weyl - orbit functions .",
    "however , there is one striking , important difference between the discretized @xmath0-functions and the kac - peterson modular @xmath0-matrices ( also known as the affine modular @xmath0 matrices ) . while a kac - peterson matrix is symmetric , there is asymmetry between the labels and arguments of the orbit functions .",
    "arguments lie in the @xmath11-fragment @xmath10 of @xmath7 , while the labels are elements of the @xmath15-fragment of @xmath17 .",
    "the affine weyl group of @xmath3 is relevant for the arguments , while for the labels , it is the dual affine weyl group .    here we point out that a different discretization of the weyl - orbit functions removes this argument - label asymmetry .",
    "this new discretization is somewhat more natural than the original one introduced in @xcite , and the resulting values of the new @xmath0-functions are identical to the elements of the kac - peterson matrices .",
    "only the starting point needs to be changed : we use a @xmath14-fragment @xmath13 as the discretization of @xmath7 , instead of the @xmath11-fragment @xmath10 of @xcite .",
    "the latter should perhaps now be denoted @xmath18 .",
    "although part of our motivation comes from the appearance of one class of orbit functions in conformal field theory , all orbit functions have cleaner , more symmetric properties with the new , finer weight - lattice discretization . for completeness",
    "we treat together here all the different classes of orbit functions related to sign homomorphisms of the weyl group of @xmath3 ( see sect .  3 below ) . as an interesting spin - off",
    ", we obtain a generalization of the kac - peterson formula for arbitrary sign homomorphism , eqn .",
    "( [ sigmakp ] ) .",
    "let us describe the plan of this paper .",
    "in the next section , notation is set and properties of the relevant affine weyl groups are reviewed .",
    "section 3 describes the sign homomorphisms and the orbit functions built using them .",
    "section 4 counts the numbers of arguments and labels of the discretized orbit functions as grid elements and the orthogonality of the @xmath15-discretized orbit functions is established .",
    "section 5 treats the affine , or kac - peterson , modular @xmath0-matrix , and establishes the identity of its elements with the values of weight - discretized weyl - orbit functions .",
    "the discrete transforms are also discussed .",
    "6 is our conclusion , which includes a short comparison between the new @xmath15- and previous @xmath12-discretizations of orbit functions",

    "the notation , established in @xcite , is used . recall that , to the simple lie algebra of rank @xmath4 ,",
    "corresponds the set of simple roots @xmath19 of the root system @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath21 spans the euclidean space @xmath22 , with the scalar product denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "the set of simple roots determines partial ordering @xmath24 on @xmath22  for @xmath25 it holds that @xmath26 if and only if @xmath27 with @xmath28 for all @xmath29 with @xmath30 . the root system @xmath20 and its set of simple roots @xmath21 can be defined independently of lie theory and such sets which correspond to compact simple lie groups are called crystallographic @xcite .",
    "there are two types of sets of simple roots  the first type with roots of only one length ( simply - laced ) , denoted conventionally as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ; and the second type with two different lengths of roots , denoted @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for the second type systems , the set of simple roots consists of short simple roots @xmath40 and long simple roots @xmath41 ,",
