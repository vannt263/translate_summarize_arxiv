    "signal transduction in biological cells refers to the set of processes by which the cells receive and process information from the environment . from the realization of the extra - cellular stimulus to its final recognition by the cell / organism",
    ", there is , in general , a complex biochemical reaction network , commonly referred to as the signal transduction pathway .",
    "faithful transmission of information through the pathway may require amplification and adaptation , which is often accomplished through positive ( amplification ) and negative ( adaptation ) feedback mechanisms built into the reaction network .",
    "external and intrinsic noise can potentially limit the faithful transduction of a ` signal ' ( information encoded in the intensity of the external stimulus and its spatio - temporal variation )  @xcite . since cellular biochemical networks often function with a limited number of reacting molecules , noise is always present , and",
    "an important question is how the cell physiology maintains its robustness in spite of the randomness in the underlying molecular events  @xcite . in the context of signal transduction",
    ", external noise refers to the randomness in the signal ( fluctuations in the local concentration of the extracellular ligand etc . ) , whereas intrinsic noise is a collective effect produced by the inherent stochasticity of the transduction mechanisms itself , such as random opening and closing of the ion channels , fluctuations in reaction rates and so on @xcite .",
    "although randomness and noise are beneficial in some instances ( population heterogeneity being a well - known example  @xcite ) , by and large , cells have evolved the means to control biochemical noise through regulatory mechanisms ( such as negative feedback ) to ensure the robustness of biochemical networks  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the context of electrical circuits , negative feedback is a well - known noise - reduction mechanism used in devices such as amplifiers and oscillators ( see @xcite for a review and important references ) .",
    "complex signaling pathways can often be productively viewed as consisting of recurring _ modules _  @xcite .",
    "a module is typically made up of multiple species of interacting molecules acting together with a specific function .",
    "a signal transduction pathway may thus be described in terms of a series of modules , interacting with each other  @xcite . in very general terms , a module receives a signal ( from the extracellular environment , or from another module ) and transmits it , possibly in a different form ( e.g. chemical signals converted to electrical pulses ) .",
    "each module can function to a certain extent in isolation , but interaction among modules and their coordination are crucial for carrying out all the complex functions of the cell .",
    "in this paper , we analyze a signaling module based on a single protein that switches between active ( a * ) and inactive ( a ) states . in the active state , a certain molecular species c is produced with a fixed rate .",
    "the accumulation of c increases the a*@xmath0a transition rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) , leading to negative feedback on the production of c. in addition , c is removed at a fixed rate independent of the activation state .    ) , generated with rate @xmath1 in the active state a * , enhances the deactivation rate @xmath2 .",
    "c is removed with a rate @xmath3 independent of the activation state of a. an input signal encoded in a temporal change @xmath4 is transduced into an output signal @xmath5 . ]    as an example , fig .",

    "( a closely related pathway also operates in cone photoreceptors in the retina . )     ions bound to calmodulin inhibit the ca@xmath6 channels , which is crucial for adaptation to repeated odorant stimuli  @xcite .",
    "the signal transduction pathway can be viewed as consisting of two modules of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , connected in series . ]    in the work presented , we develop a systematic analytical framework to study the dynamics of the simple auto - regulatory module shown in fig .",

    "the activation and deactivation kinetics would be described by a two - state poisson process . in the presence of feedback ,",
    "the deactivation rate , at any given time , becomes dependent on the history of transitions , and makes the effective two - state kinetics non - markovian .",
    "we use a path - integral technique to evaluate the effects of feedback perturbatively , which enables us to derive the noise from the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is in contrast to stochastic analysis of biochemical networks based on langevin equations  @xcite with additive white noise ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain explicit analytical expressions for the different statistical averages as well as correlation and response functions of the module in the limit of weak feedback .",
    "we also perform monte carlo simulations to test the analytical results in the weak feedback limit and to investigate the strong feedback regime .",
    "the path - integral formalism we develop is similar to the one described in  @xcite , and the system considered is the same as in  @xcite . the calculations in  @xcite",

    "we find that , in the context of the ion - channel model , the rate of removal of ca@xmath6 ions , @xmath32 , is the single most important control parameter of the model . when @xmath32 is large ( compared to the intrinsic closing rate for the channel ) ,",
    "the short - time scale dynamic response characteristics of the system are improved by negative feedback . in this case",
    ", feedback reduces the time scale of decay of the auto - correlation and response functions , and thus extends the response of the system to higher frequencies of input stimulus .    for all parameter values , the negative feedback shifts the range of sensitivity of the system ( i.e. the range of stimulus magnitudes for which the response is appreciably non - zero and not saturated ) towards stronger stimuli . at the same time",
    ", the range of sensitivity gets broader ( i.e. , the `` dynamic range '' is increased ) with increasing feedback . while the steady state response to a fixed stimulus is always reduced by the negative feedback , a remarkable effect was seen in the coefficient of variation for the calcium concentration .",
    "increasing the feedback was found to increase this quantity in the large @xmath32 regime .",
    "for small @xmath32 , however , the opposite was seen : the coefficient of variation was reduced with feedback , for sufficiently weak stimuli . in this regime",
    ", the negative feedback therefore improves the precision with which one can discriminate among stimuli of different magnitudes based on the system output . having a small @xmath32 , however ,",
    "was generally found to adversely affect the temporal response characteristics .",
    "starting from the experimental literature , we have obtained estimates for the dimensionless parameters in our model for the specific case of calcium signaling in olfactory sensory neurons ( the corresponding module is shown in the lower part of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the rate of opening of the cyclic - nucleotide - gated channel varies in the range @xmath334  @xmath335 depending on the strength of the odorant stimulus .",
    "the parameter governing the calcium dynamics is @xmath336 and for the feedback parameter we find @xmath337 ",
    "@xmath338  @xcite ; @xmath339 ( calculated from the density of cng channels and the geometry of the cilium as cited in  @xcite , assuming a homogeneous distribution of channels ) ; @xmath340 ( calculated from a taylor expansion of the calcium - extrusion term used in the deterministic model of ref .",

    "@xcite(lower estimate ) and @xcite ( upper estimate ) ) . ]",
    ". note , in particular , that @xmath32 is found to have a relatively large value . in the view of our results",
    ", this suggests that the calcium - mediated feedback in olfactory transduction evolved so as to improve the temporal response characteristics of the system , rather than to improve the discriminability of weak stimuli .",
    "our findings are consistent with the results of experimental studies in a variety of sensory systems with calcium - mediated negative feedback .",
    "the feedback - induced shift of the range of sensitivity to higher stimulus magnitudes has been demonstrated in olfactory sensory neurons and in cone photoreceptor cells ( reviewed in ref .",
    "the temporal characteristic of response was found to be altered in several studies in which the strength of feedback was experimentally manipulated . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the time course of response to a pulse stimulus was found to be slowed down when the frog olfactory cilium was put in lowered external calcium concentrations ( in such conditions , the ion flux j , and therefore the dimensionless coupling @xmath136 , is decreased ) .",
    "a more pronounced effect of this type was observed in similar experiments for drosophila photoreceptor cells in ref .",
    "a marked slowing down of the response to a step stimulus was observed for the newt olfactory cilium in ref .",
    "@xcite when the calcium flux j was decreased by changing the holding potential .",
    "fluctuations in the steady state have received less attention in the biological literature .",
    "the power spectrum of odorant - induced current fluctuations across the membrane of rat olfactory sensory cilia was studied experimentally by lowe and gold  @xcite .",
    "they observed that the tail of the power - spectrum decays with an effective exponent in the range 2.3  2.5 , which is suggestive of a crossover between @xmath220 and @xmath348 decay . in this case , however , the dynamics of the camp module ( shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) should be taken into account in the theoretical treatment , as fluctuations in camp give an important contribution to the variability of the response @xcite .",
    "we are currently in the process of extending this study to include spatial effects .",
    "in particular , in olfactory sensory neurons , the ca@xmath6 ion channels are spatially distributed along long and thin cellular compartments called cilia .",
    "the feedback studied in the present manuscript coupled with calcium diffusion inside the cilium can give rise to non - trivial spatial correlations between the channels , and it will be interesting to study how the spatial coupling affects the overall kinetics of the system .    we gratefully acknowledge peter hnggi and benjamin lindner for helpful and illuminating discussions .",
