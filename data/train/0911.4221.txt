    "in many experiments related to quantum information processing , the readout plays a critical role .",

    "the measurements were done with a weak driving power of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of measurement photons populated in the resonator .    it has been suggested that employing a nonlinear resonator instead of linear resonator should relax the strong demand of low - noise broadband microwave measurements because the latching effect between the bistable states in a nonlinear resonator is expected to provide a larger but still fast enough response.@xcite such scheme , or the  bifurcation amplifier , \" has been applied to the readout of charge qubits@xcite and flux qubits,@xcite where josephson junctions ( jjs ) as nonlinear inductors are employed for the nonlinear resonators . in many cases ,",
    "the nonlinear resonators with jjs have lumped - element capacitors , and their resonant frequencies are around 1  ghz.@xcite in general , however , using a distributed element such as a coplanar waveguide ( cpw)@xcite makes it easier to increase the resonant frequency and the quality factor .",
    "a higher resonant frequency is advantageous for suppressing photon - number fluctuations , which may cause qubit dephasing even when the readout circuit is turned off.@xcite choosing a high quality factor and a resonant frequency much higher than the qubit frequency would be also helpful in suppressing the qubit relaxation through the resonator.@xcite    in this work , we have characterized at low temperatures , @xmath2  k , nonlinear cpw resonators with jjs , whose resonant frequencies are as high as @xmath5  ghz .",
    "we observed the  bifurcation \" as expected theoretically ; the resonators showed a hysteretic response to the frequency sweep when they were driven with a sufficiently large power .",

    "the behavior of @xmath31 is becoming similar to that in resonator  a1 .",
    "when @xmath96 is decreased further down to @xmath186  ghz , we did not find the bistable region at all , which is a bit surprising because according to eq .",

    "[ fig : b1ql ] , for example , the sharp decrease of @xmath31 at @xmath186  ghz is mostly due to the change in @xmath25 .",

    "resonators  a1 and b1 have completely different @xmath25 in the linear regime : @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively . as the most probable reason",
    ", we have already mentioned the difference in the quality of the dielectric for the cpws . the value of @xmath191 for resonators  a1 is actually still considerably smaller than those we obtained for usual cpw resonators without jj fabricated at the same time as resonators  a1 .",
    "thus , there should be a contribution from jj as well .    in the bistable region",
    ", it is still possible to estimate the quality factors .",
    "we have seen that fig .",
    "[ fig : a1pdep](b ) suggests a strong @xmath85 dependence of @xmath25 in resonator  a1 .",
    "the @xmath85 dependence is likely to be due to a finite @xmath56 of jj .",
    "the main reason is that the usual cpw resonators without jj looked almost @xmath85 independent in the relevant power range . in general , @xmath25 of cpw resonators is known to increase with increasing @xmath85 at least in the weak - power range , where the average energy stored in the resonator at @xmath30 is comparable to @xmath193 or smaller.@xcite this behavior was also observed in our resonators in the linear regime .",
    "both in resonators  a1 and b1 , @xmath25 gained several percents when @xmath85 was increased by 5  db from @xmath194  dbm .",
    "figure  [ fig : a1pdep](b ) is explained if @xmath56 is a function of @xmath44 and its value decreases with increasing @xmath44 , which is quite likely ( see , for example , sec .  6.3 of ref .  ) .",
    "although we are interested in the case that the jj stays in the superconducting branch with zero dc voltage , it does not necessarily mean that the ac voltage is also zero .",
    "the ac voltage is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vj ] ) , and when it is nonzero , an ac current flows through @xmath56 causing a loss",
    ". this picture is supported by the following quantitative consideration : according to the simulation in sec .",
    "[ sec : th ] , the reduction of @xmath31 becomes considerable when @xmath56 is decreased below @xmath101",
    "@xmath15 in resonator  a1 , whereas the dc measurements on the test junctions suggest that @xmath56 in resonator  a1 can be as low as @xmath195  @xmath15 .",
    "it is also consistent with the results on resonator  b1 .",
    "because b1 has a smaller @xmath196 and a much larger superconducting gap , the tunnel barrier of the junctions is thicker .",
    "thus , @xmath56 must be much larger , which explains the fact that @xmath85 dependence is much smaller .",
    "the @xmath169 dependence is also explained because @xmath169 modulates the ratio of @xmath197 as @xmath169 approaches @xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath172 increases , but there is no obvious mechanism that @xmath169 changes @xmath56 .",
    "we have also confirmed by the simulation in sec .",
    "[ sec : th ] that @xmath31 indeed depends on the ratio of @xmath201 and that the experimental @xmath31 vs.  @xmath96 in fig .  [ fig : b1ql ] is qualitatively reproduced with @xmath56 on the order of @xmath202  @xmath203 in fig .",
