    "a link is said to be _ trivial _ if it is the boundary of a set of embedded , disjoint discs ( called spanning discs ) in the ambient space @xmath0 .",
    "the triviality of a link is perhaps more intuitive when expressed in terms of link diagrams : a link is trivial if and only if it admits a diagram which contains no crossings . in general , it is hard to decide if a given link is trivial or not .",
    "we can , however , decide if an alternating link is trivial or not by little more than looking at its diagram .",
    "a link diagram is said to be _ alternating _ if , as we travel around each component of the link , we pass over and under strands of the link alternately .",
    "alternating link _ is a link that admits an alternating diagram . after a straightforward normalization ,",
    "an alternating diagram represents a non - trivial link if and only if it contains crossings .",
    "we provide a new proof of this result here .",
    "there are several approaches in the literature for showing that alternating links are non - trivial .",
    "most of these approaches rely upon the use of a powerful knot invariant : the determinant in @xcite ; the alexander polynomial in @xcite and @xcite ; the jones polynomial in @xcite and the q - polynomial in @xcite , although a purely geometric proof was given in @xcite .",
    "these proofs provide different perspectives as to why the result holds .",
    "the argument presented in this paper differs from these proofs as it uses dehn s lemma and a solution to the word problem for link groups to show in a very direct way that spanning disks for the link can not exist .",
    "this approach therefore uses only classic topology and combinatorial group theory to provide a direct and intuitive proof for the non - triviality of alternating links .",
    "we prove the following .",
    "[ th : main ] if @xmath1 is a link admitting an alternating projection with crossings , then @xmath1 is non - trivial .",
    "our method of proof is to show that the longitudes of the appropriate links are non - trivial by solving the word problem of their link group .",
    "it then follows that the links themselves are non - trivial .",
    "if @xmath1 is an oriented link with components @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a tubular neighbourhood of @xmath4 , a _ meridian _ @xmath5 of @xmath4 is a non - separating simple closed curve in @xmath6 that bounds a disc in @xmath3 and a longitude @xmath7 is a simple closed curve in @xmath6 that is homologous to @xmath4 in @xmath3 and null - homologous in the exterior @xmath8 .",
    "a standard and well known consequence of dehn s lemma and the loop theorem is that a link is trivial if and only if all of its longitudes are trivial in the link group .",
    "this reduces theorem  [ th : main ] to the problem of solving the word problem for the longitudes of the link .",
    "we do this by using a simple geometric argument to rewrite the longitudes of the link in a certain normal form with respect to the checker - board colouring of a link projection .",
    "specifically , we write the longitude as a curve which intersects white regions of the checker - board colouring of the link projection before any black regions . this normal form allows us to apply some basic results in small cancellation theory and solve the word problem for the link groups , concluding that the longitudes are non - trivial .",
    "i would like to thank j.  crisp for his very interesting comments .",
    "the _ checker - board colouring _ of a link projection is an assignment of a colour black or white to each of the regions of the projection in such a way that adjacent regions are assigned different colours .",
    "[ lem : zigzag ] the @xmath9-th longitude @xmath7 of a link @xmath1 is homotopic to a simple closed curve @xmath10 such that , in terms of the projection , all intersections of @xmath11 with white regions of the checker - board colouring occur before any intersections with black regions , with respect to a chosen base point and orientation",
    ".    the reader may find it helpful to refer to figure  1 while reading the following proof .",
    "begin by fixing a projection @xmath12 of @xmath1 . for convenience",
    "assign a label @xmath13 to each of the regions of @xmath12 .",
    "then , up to homotopy , a based , oriented loop in the link complement can be described by a word in the alphabet @xmath14 by assigning the letter @xmath15 whenever the loop passes downwards through the region @xmath15 , and the letter @xmath16 whenever the loop passes upwards through the region @xmath15 .",
    "notice that the checker - board colouring induces a colour on each letter in @xmath17 .",
    "we need to choose a representative of the longitude . to do this",
    "we define the _",
    "@xmath9-th double _ @xmath18 of a link @xmath1 to be the curve determined by a parallel copy of the @xmath9-th component of its projection ( so this is the curve determined by the black - board framing ) .",
    "we define the length of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , to be the number of times it `` passes through '' the projection plane .",
    "it is a standard fact ( for example see @xcite ) that the longitude @xmath7 can be represented by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 represents the @xmath9-th meridian ( we will specify a representative of the meridian shortly ) and @xmath22 is the self - linking number of @xmath4 . since there are two choices for the double @xmath18 ( either side of @xmath4 ) , we may choose @xmath21 and @xmath18 such that the longitude @xmath7 is represented by a word of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "notice that @xmath26 alternates in colour and sign .    without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that @xmath27 is black .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath27 appears with a positive exponent , _ ie .",
    "_ the first letter of @xmath26 is @xmath28 . a similar argument deals with the @xmath29 case .",
    "we now describe how to deform this representative to the form required in the statement of the lemma .",
    "we split the argument into three steps .",
    "_ begin by wrapping @xmath18 around the component @xmath4 . to do this fix the first and last intersection points , @xmath27 and @xmath30 , of @xmath18 and slide the arc @xmath31 underneath @xmath4 as in figure  1(b ) .",
    "now , moving inwards along this arc from both ends , fix the next two intersection points and slide the rest of the arc over @xmath4 as in figure  1(c ) .",
    "continue this process of sliding the arc under and over for as long as is possible .",
    "this procedure gives a word of the form @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 are coloured black and @xmath34 are white .",
    "again this is shown in figure  1(c ) .",
    "_ next pull the curve @xmath35 along the component @xmath4 so that the white intersections follow the deformed @xmath9-th double for as long as possible , and the remaining intersection points lie in regions on the opposite side of the curve @xmath4 .",
    "thus , since @xmath36 , we obtain a curve @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are black .",
    "this is indicated in figure  1(d ) .",
    "this representative of the longitude doubles back upon itself and so we can remove some of the white pairs of intersection points , giving the isotopic curve @xmath39 , as in figure  1(e ) .",
    "now if @xmath40 we are done , otherwise we must move on to step three .",
    "_ all that remains is to move the remaining white intersections @xmath41 to the end of the arc .",
    "clearly this can be done by a sequence of the moves shown in figure  2 .",
    "these moves are indicated in figures  1  ( e )  ( f )  and  ( g ) .    stopping after step 2 in the proof shows that the longitude @xmath7 is conjugate to a curve with the properties of @xmath11 in the lemma .",
    "in actual fact this is enough to prove the main theorem , however we prefer the stronger form of the lemma .    [",
    "fig : norm ]    [ fig : move ]",
    "as in the proof of the lemma , label the regions of the projection @xmath12 of @xmath1 with @xmath42 .",
    "now form a group presentation by taking the set of labels @xmath43 as the set of generators and deriving a relator @xmath44 from each crossing according to the scheme shown in figure  3 .",
    "this gives a presentation which , after _ symmetrization _ , _ ie .",
    "_ adjoining all cyclic permutations and inverses of the relators to the presentation , we call the _ augmented dehn presentation _ of @xmath1 .",
    "we will see that , although it is an abuse of notation , using the same letters for the regions of the projection and the group generators is natural and convenient .",
    "we also define the _ augmented link _ obtained from @xmath12 to be the link obtained by adding an extra unknot component bounding the projection , and forming a link by regarding @xmath46 as the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane of @xmath49 and `` pulling the overcrossings up a little . ''",
    "if we choose a base point above the plane , a generator @xmath15 of the augmented dehn presentation is realized in the complement of the augmented link by a loop which passes downwards through the region @xmath50 and passes back up through the unbounded region of the augmented link to the base point .",
    "notice that up to homotopy there is a clear correspondence between words in the augmented dehn presentation and words arising from based , oriented loops as in the proof of lemma  [ lem : zigzag ] .",
    "clearly the augmented dehn presentation is the symmetrization of the dehn presentation ( for example see @xcite ) of the group of the augmented link .",
    "consequently the augmented dehn presentation is a presentation of the free product of the infinite cyclic group and the link group . therefore solving the word problem for the augmented dehn presentation of @xmath1",
    "solves it for the link group of @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that particular presentations of the groups of certain links have a very strong combinatorial structure . to state",
    "this result precisely we need to introduce a little more notation .",
    "a link projection @xmath12 divides the plane into _",
    "regions_. @xmath12 is said to be _ reduced _ if at each crossing four distinct regions of the plane meet .",
    "every link admits reduced diagrams .",
    "thus reduced diagrams do not contain either of the configurations @xmath51 where the rest of the link is contained within the two boxes .",
    "it is clear from the figures that every diagram is equivalent to a reduced diagram .",
    "a reduced projection is said to be _ prime _ if it is connected , contains at least one crossing and there does not exist a simple closed curve in the plane intersecting @xmath12 transversally in exactly two points on different arcs of @xmath12 . a link admits a non - prime diagram if and only if it can not be expressed as the connected sum of non - trivial links .          a _ chain _ is a van kampen diagram having the form shown in figure  4 , where @xmath52 .",
    "we call the word @xmath53 a _ chain word_. ( for details on van kampen diagrams see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "( in @xcite they are called  diagrams . \" ) )      given an arbitrary finite group presentation , the set of lengths of all words representing an element of the group has a minimum .",
    "we call any word which attains this minimum a _ geodesic_. geodesics in a 4t4 presentation are characterized by the absence of chain words . for the following theorem , recall that a word is _ freely reduced _ if it contains no subwords of the form @xmath55 .        using the checker - board colouring",
    "we can assign a _ parity _ , black or white , to each generator - inverse pair according to the colour of the region that generator corresponds to .",
    "notice that the relators of the augmented dehn presentation are words which alternate in parity and therefore the horizontal and vertical edges of a chain correspond to letters of different parities .",
    "since the sum of two non - trivial links is non - trivial ( this follows from the additivity of genus under the connect sum operation , for example ) , it is enough to prove the theorem for prime links . in this case , by lemma  [ lem : zigzag ] and the geometric interpretation of the generators of the augmented dehn presentation , the longitude can be represented by a non - empty word @xmath26 which changes parity exactly once .",
    "since the projection is reduced , @xmath26 is freely reduced .",
    "a word of this form can not contain a chain word ( as these change parity twice ) and since the augmented dehn presentation is a 4t4 small cancellation group , the geodesic characterization theorem tells us that the longitudes are non - trivial and therefore the link itself is non - trivial .",
    "john crisp has observed that the theory of cat(0 ) groups can be used in place of small cancellation theory in proving that the elements of the link group described by lemma  [ lem : zigzag ] are non - trivial .",
    "it is also possible to use dugopolski s algorithm from @xcite to prove that the elements of the link group described by lemma  [ lem : zigzag ] .",
    "dugopolski s algorithm uses normal surface theory rather than group theory ."
