    "the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite has become a useful tool to describe phenomena arising in quantum dot devices at low temperatures .",
    "it encompasses single - electron tunneling phenomena @xcite , cotunneling and resonant tunneling @xcite as well as kondo @xcite physics .",
    "these phenomena have been verified in many experimental quantum dot set - ups realized at the interface of a two - dimensional electron gas @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite and quantum wires @xcite as well as in single - molecule junctions @xcite . at thermal energies larger than the coupling @xmath1 to the leads transport",
    "can be suppressed at low bias due to coulomb blockade . in this regime",
    "sequential tunneling dominates the transport across the siam , and tunneling in and out of the dot is well described in terms of rate equations @xcite , with rates obtained within a second order perturbation theory in the tunneling hamiltonian ( i.e. , first order in @xmath1 ) .",
    "when the temperature is decreased to values of the order of the tunneling coupling @xmath1 or lower , the sequential tunneling approximation breaks down , as processes of higher order in @xmath1 start to become important .",
    "the intermediate coupling regime with tunnel couplings of the order of the thermal energy or higher has not been much investigated so far .",
    "this is in part due to the difficulty of developing theories capable to cope with strong coulomb interactions and intermediate coupling at the same time .",
    "however , it is this intermediate regime which might be of interest for transport through some single - molecule junctions @xcite and is relevant to interpret experiments on negative tunneling magnetoresistance @xcite . in the single molecule experiments @xcite a conductance gap",
    "is observed at low bias which suggests the presence of charging effects .",
    "the gap is followed by conductance peaks whose broadening is larger than the estimated temperature , being a hint that tunneling processes of high order might be responsible for the broadening . in ref .",
    "@xcite coulomb oscillations of the conductance versus the gate voltage are clearly seen in carbon nanotubes contacted to ferromagnetic leads ; however , the occurrence of a negative magnetoresistance requires the presence of level shifts due to higher order charge fluctuation processes @xcite .",
    "when the temperature is increased even further , one observes the occurrence of a zero bias maximum @xcite or minimum @xcite of the nonlinear conductance for small temperatures in a quantum dot with large coulomb interaction , depending on whether the single particle resonance lies deep below ( kondo regime ) or above ( empty - orbital regime ) the fermi level , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we describe the transport beyond the sequential tunneling regime by using a diagrammatic approach to the stationary reduced density matrix of the quantum dot and the stationary electron current onto one of the leads . along the same lines as in ref.@xcite",
    "we include all possible diagrams which dress the second order tunneling rates by charge fluctuations in and out of the quantum dot .",
    "different from the method in @xcite , we do not only extract tunneling induced level shifts from the analytical expressions .",
    "we calculate _ transition rates _ and express the density matrix and the current in terms of those .",
    "our `` dressed second order '' ( dso ) diagrams are a small subset of the diagrams kept within the so called resonant tunneling approximation ( rta ) , first proposed by @xcite to describe the beyond sequential tunneling regime . in particular , for a spinless quantum dot",
    "the rta is exact and reproduces e.g. the expected breit - wigner resonance shape of the linear conductance .",
    "the much smaller dso subset , too , yields the known exact result for the current .",
    "the dso yields the rates in a straightforward way .",
    "we compared the predictions of the rta and dso both for the linear and nonlinear conductance in the case of infinitely large coulomb - repulsion and found only small deviations in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "larger deviations are seen at lower temperatures where the conductance obtained by the dso is remaining considerably below the rta - result .",
    "one major achievement of the dso is its capability to properly describe a cross - over from thermally broadened conductance peaks at high temperatures to tunneling broadened conductance peaks at low temperatures .",
    "this is of relevance e.g. to explain the experiments of ref .",
    "the dso tunneling rates are given in integral form with the integrand including the product of the density of electron levels and a lorentzian - like function .",
    "interestingly , a similar form is necessary to ensure convergence of the current in models of quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads @xcite .",
    "hence , the dso also provides the minimum diagram selection which yields effective dynes spectral densities @xcite in superconducting set - ups .    for small temperatures",
    "one expects a zero bias resonance in the transport across a quantum dot with odd occupation and large coulomb interaction .",
    "both the dso and the rta contain this resonance .",
    "to test the reliability of the dso we thus investigated the temperature dependence of the linear conductance obtained by it .",
    "we found that there is a temperature @xmath2 such that the conductance is a universal function of the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "we compared our expression for @xmath2 with results of other theories for the kondo temperature in the case of infinite coulomb interaction .",
    "interestingly , as in the rta @xcite , we find an exponent differing precisely by a factor of two from the result in ref .",
    "moreover , the shape of the conductance curve differs from that expected e.g. from numerical renormalization group predictions .    to show the predictive power of the dso on a _ qualitative _ level we address the case that the two spin levels are split energetically by a magnetic field and reproduce the result that the zero bias resonance of the conductance versus the bias splits up into two peaks @xcite .",
    "moreover , we consider the situation that in addition to an energy difference the levels have different capacitive couplings to the contacts ( still equal tunneling coupling ) . in this case",
    "we obtain that one part of the double peak vanishes with increasing asymmetry",
    ". measurements which might be explained by this effect were reported in ref .",
    "furthermore , we show the behaviour of the dso - resonance in an unconventional situation : the chemical potentials of the leads depend on the spin",
    ". only one of the four chemical potentials is varied and the others are kept constant and equal . in this situation ,",
    "the dso yields only one resonance .",
    "experimental results with a pseudo - spin instead of real spin @xcite seem to be in agreement with this prediction .",
    "finally , we focus on the case of finite but still large coulomb interaction and consider the linear conductance as a function of the gate voltage and the temperature .",
    "the effect of changing the gate voltage is a shift of the relative position of the level energy with respect to the fermi level .",
    "this offers the possibility to investigate the cross - over from the kondo regime to the mixed valence and finally the empty orbital regime , corresponding to single particle energies lying deep below , in the vicinity ( within an uncertainty of the order of @xmath1 ) and above the fermi level of the leads , respectively .",
    "we compare with experimental results in ref .",
    "@xcite and obtain in many respects qualitative agreement .    in summary ,",
    "despite its simplicity , the dso provides important insights on the physics of a correlated anderson quantum dot over a broad regime of parameters . because the theory is easily scalable to multilevel quantum dots set - ups",
    ", it could become an interesting tool to investigate complex quantum dot systems .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section ii introduces the model of the transport current .",
    "section iii illustrates the diagrammatic approach and recalls known results for the reduced density matrix and the current in second order in the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "analytical expressions for the current and the reduced density matrix are provided in terms of rates .",
    "the dso approximation is explained in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , vi , and vii the dso is applied to the spinless case , to the case of infinite interaction and finite interaction , respectively . in particular , in sec .",
    "v and vi the dso and rta predictions are compared ; the case of energetically split levels is considered . in sec .",
    "vii on the other hand we compare with the experimental results in @xcite .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . viii .",
    "the hamilton operator of our system is @xmath4 . in the reservoirs we assume noninteracting electrons .",
    "correspondingly , we choose @xmath5 in this formula , the indices @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the lead , the spin and the wave vector of an electron level in the contacts , respectively ; @xmath9 is the band energy corresponding to this electron level ; @xmath10 is the annihilation operator of the level @xmath11 and the dagger denotes the hermitian conjugate .",
    "the hamiltonian of the isolated quantum dot is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coulomb interaction and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the annihilation and creation operator of the level @xmath16 on the dot .",
    "alternatively , the hamiltonian of the isolated dot can be written as @xmath17 for any of the four many particle states @xmath18 we use `` @xmath19 '' to denote the energy of this state .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dot is diagonal in the basis given by these four states . by comparison with the above representation",
    "we get : @xmath20 . only differences between energies of quantum dot states are relevant .",
    "we introduce the terminology @xmath21    finally , the tunneling hamiltonian , @xmath22 connects electron levels on the leads with the level on the quantum dot @xcite . with the term `` order '' of a tunneling process/ diagram we mean its order in the `` tunneling coupling '' or  in @xmath23  .",
    "we assume that there is an initial time at which the systems are still separate and express this by writing the initial density matrix as product of density matrices of the quantum dot and the leads : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is some arbitrary initial density matrix describing the state of the dot ; @xmath26 is the density matrix of the leads in thermal equilibrium .",
    "specifically , we choose @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the chemical potential of lead @xmath6 and where @xmath29 is a normalization factor .",
    "after this initial time we assume that the time evolution of the density matrix is ruled by the total hamiltonian @xmath30 according to the liouville - von neumann equation @xcite which is the analogon of the schrdinger equation for density matrices .      for each of the leads we define an electron counting operator as @xmath31 and the operator of the particle current onto that lead as @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "then the current onto the chosen lead at time @xmath33 is @xmath34 we define the stationary current by letting the time go to infinity and taking the average current : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the argument of the laplace transform of the function @xmath37 .",
    "the total weight of the multiplicant @xmath38 over @xmath39 is always unity , but for smaller and smaller values of @xmath40 it will be distributed over a larger and larger time interval .",
    "the current in this definition is zero as long as the contacts are finite .",
    "therefore , we first let the size of the contacts go to infinity and redefine @xmath41 then the current in the definition of eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) is our model of the dc - current measured in transport experiments with quantum dots .",
    "an analysis of the time evolution of the current , eq .",
    "( [ current(t ) ] ) , shows that it can be separated into subsequent smallest segments , so - called irreducible tunneling processes @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the stationary current can be reduced to the calculation of the corresponding transform of these irreducible segments .",
    "the theory is exact .",
    "the technical realization of this theory can be described as follows : the irreducible segments of the time evolution of the current are called  kernels `` . we distinguish between the ' ' density matrix kernel `` @xmath42 which determines the reduced density matrix of the quantum dot and the ' ' current kernel  @xmath43 which defines the relation between the reduced density matrix and the current . the fact that the time evolution of the current is completely determined by the kernels",
    "can be expressed in a compact way by the two equations : @xmath44 + \\int_{t_0}^t ds k ( t - s ) \\rho_\\odot(s),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the terminology @xmath45 for the reduced density matrix of the quantum dot .",
    "the second equation is also called the quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "we take the laplace transform of both equations in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "then , the second equation allows the calculation of the stationary reduced density matrix as far as @xmath47 is calculated .",
    "finally , the laplace transform of the first equation can be used to calculate the stationary current .",
    "the calculation of the current means thus the calculation of the kernels .",
    "the contributions to the kernels are visualized by diagrams , whose number and variety is huge .",
    "this forces us to take into account only special classes of diagrams about which we have reason to believe that they might be important and which we are able to calculate . only in the special case of the spinless quantum dot an exact solution",
    "was presented @xcite .",
    "our approximation is an extension of the second order theory , so we recall in the following its meaning and its main predictions .",
    "[ introduction of parameter w ] if we multiply the tunneling hamiltonian by a dimension - less parameter  @xmath48 ",
    ", then everything becomes a function of @xmath48 , including the kernels ",
    "@xmath49  , ",
    "@xmath50  and finally also the current , `` @xmath51 '' .",
    "all of the contributions to the kernels have an order in the sense that the coefficients of the tunneling hamiltonian appear a certain number of times .",
    "all odd orders vanish .",
    "thus , they have the structure : @xmath52 for small values of @xmath48 , i. e. , for weak tunneling coupling , one takes into account only the approximations for the kernels of order @xmath53 and calculates the current on this basis .",
    "one obtains the current of order @xmath53 , ",
    "@xmath54 , i.e. , the taylor expansion of the current around @xmath55 of order @xmath53 . the current , eq . ( [ current ] ) ,",
    "is analytic in @xmath56 . in the case",
    "@xmath57 one obtains the second order current , which is just of the form @xmath58 .",
    "one of the diagrams visualizing the second order contributions to the density matrix kernel is shown in figure [ second order ] .",
    "a possible way of describing the process is to say that the quantum dot is at first in the un - occupied state `` @xmath59 '' ; then an electron with spin @xmath7 tunnels in two steps onto the dot .",
    "finally , the dot is in the state `` @xmath7 '' .",
    "the analytical expressions which correspond to the diagrams are given by diagrammatic rules , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the expression for the diagram in figure [ second order ] reads : @xmath60 where we let @xmath40 , the argument of the laplace transform , still be finite . for simplicity",
    "we assume degeneracy , @xmath61 , and write @xmath62 .",
    "later we will consider also the case of different energies @xmath63 .",
    "we let @xmath64 be the fermi function at chemical potential @xmath28 and temperature @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "we perform then the sum with respect to the leads and the wave vector .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is taken by replacing the sum with respect to the allowed wave vectors @xmath68 by an integral over the first brillouin zone .",
    "the expression turns into : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of allowed wave vectors in the first brillouin zone per volume in the wave vector space .",
    "we split now the integration into two parts : first , we fix the band energy and integrate over the surface in the first brillouin zone where @xmath71 equals this band energy . in a second step ,",
    "we integrate over the band energies @xcite .",
    "the integral turns into : @xmath72    there are two diagrams of second order which are contributions to the `` kernel element '' @xmath73 .",
    "they are given by the above diagram and by the one we get by mirroring this with respect to a horizontal axis .",
    "their contributions are complex conjugate , so we have to take two times the real part of the above expression . in the limit @xmath74",
    "we obtain : @xmath75 where we used the notation @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the case that the tunneling coefficients @xmath78 were independent of the wave vector the function @xmath79 would just be proportional to the density of electron levels in lead @xmath6 .",
    "however , we point out that we do not use such a simplifying assumption about the tunneling coefficients at this stage .",
    "the dimension of @xmath80 is `` energy '' , correspondingly the dimension of the kernel elements is `` rate '' .",
    "the other second order kernel elements are calculated essentially in the same way . with the further notation @xmath81",
    "we obtain : @xmath82 for simplicity we assume for this a symmetry in the leads with respect to the spin , i.e. , that the definition of @xmath80 , eq .",
    "( [ definition of alpha ] ) , does not depend on the spin . by considering the contributions of diagrams as in figure [ zero trace ] one can verify that the general property of the density matrix kernel @xmath83 holds true also _ within _ the second order theory .",
    "therefore , we already calculated implicitly the remaining kernel elements of the form @xmath84 if @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we can say that it is a linear operator with rank three or lower acting on the four - dimensional space of the diagonal matrices since one degree of freedom is destroyed by the condition that the trace of the resulting matrix is zero .",
    "we can conclude that there is a diagonal solution ",
    "@xmath86  of the quantum master equation ( qme ) in the stationary limit . with the notations",
    "@xmath87 the qme turns into the following set of two equations ( for the three variables @xmath88 ) :    @xmath89    this information is sufficient to determine the stationary reduced density matrix since we know that the normalization condition , @xmath90 , holds . the solution is : @xmath91 where we used the notations @xmath92      in order to calculate the current we have to determine the second order current kernel .",
    "the structure of the contributions to it is the same as that of the contributions to the density matrix kernel .",
    "we take into account only the diagrams with the final vertex on the lower contour .",
    "the lead - index attached to the corresponding tunneling line is fixed and given by the lead onto which we are calculating the current .",
    "an additional sign , as compared to the density matrix kernel , has then to be taken into account .",
    "there are several equivalent possibilities of defining the current kernel @xcite .",
    "for example , the diagram in figure [ second order ] yields the contribution @xmath93 to the trace @xmath94 .",
    "the other contribution to this trace comes from the diagram in figure [ zero trace ] if we set @xmath95 .",
    "the two contributions are complex conjugate and so we get : @xmath96 in an analogous way one obtains : @xmath97 the second order particle current is then found by applying the current kernel to the reduced density matrix and taking the trace @xcite : @xmath98 where we used `` @xmath99 '' to denote the opposite lead of lead `` @xmath6 '' and the abbreviations : @xmath100 the letter @xmath48 denotes the coupling parameter as introduced above ; for simplicity we will leave it away in the following .",
    "this is the particle current onto lead @xmath6 .",
    "the net current , i.e. , the sum of the two currents onto lead @xmath6 and @xmath99 , is zero . to determine the electric current one has to multiply by the electron charge .    in the case of proportional tunneling coupling ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath101 , with @xmath102 positive scalar factors fulfilling @xmath103 , the expression for the current can be simplified : @xmath104 the prefactor of the second line turns out to be the stationary electron number on the quantum dot , i.e. , the expectation value @xmath105 with @xmath106 the particle counting operator on the quantum dot ; the prefactor of the first line we might call the `` hole number '' , i.e. , the expectation value of @xmath107 .",
    "the second order approximation can be interpreted in terms of transitions . for every pair of two quantum dot states `` @xmath108 '' and `` @xmath109 '' with neighbouring particle numbers and every lead @xmath6",
    "we determine a rate of transitions `` @xmath110 '' caused by the tunneling of an electron from lead @xmath6 onto the dot or from the dot onto lead @xmath6 , provided that the dot is in the state @xmath111 .",
    "the stationary density matrix is determined by the demand that all of these transitions compensate each other .",
    "then we calculate the current by balancing the transitions .",
    "our non - perturbative approximation is an extension of the second order theory .",
    "the equations for the density matrix and the current in terms of the transition rates @xmath112 still hold true but the expressions for these rates change .",
    "in this section we account for diagrams similar to the ones of the second order theory but  dress `` them by charge fluctuations . figure [ dressed second order example ] shows two possibilities of dressing the second order diagram of figure [ second order ] .",
    "apart from the electron that tunnels in two steps onto the dot there is one more electron level of the leads involved .",
    "we might say that an electron ( lower example diagram ) or a hole ( upper example diagram ) tunnels for some time halfway onto the dot and then leaves it again . for linguistic simplicity we restrict ourselves here to speaking about particles tunneling _ onto _ the dot , with the consequence that we are using the terms ' ' hole `` as well as ' ' electron  .",
    "the tunneling of the one electron which finally enters the dot is accompanied by the tunneling of further electrons or holes in these diagrams .    according to the diagrammatic rules the sum of the contributions of the diagrams in figure [ dressed second order example ] to the density matrix kernel",
    "is given by @xmath113 where we let @xmath40 still be finite and used the notations : @xmath114 in the first line we recognize the contribution of the second order diagram .",
    "however , the integrand is multiplied by a factor , the second line , and this reflects the participation of further particles . from the upper diagram in figure [",
    "dressed second order example ] we get ",
    "@xmath115 `` , from the lower one we get ' ' @xmath116 `` .",
    "the sum yields ' ' @xmath117  which appears in the factor .",
    "because of the existence of the two spins there is still a third way of dressing our second order diagram with one further tunneling line : the bubble on the lower contour of figure [ dressed second order example ] might as well represent an electron with _ opposite _",
    "spin which accompanies the tunneling .",
    "the contribution of this diagram is the same as the contribution of the diagram with only one spin appearing , but it is important because it does not have a counterpart : there is _ no way _ of dressing the diagram with a bubble on the upper contour which represents a hole of the _ opposite _ spin . finally , there is the possibility to dress the diagram by a tunneling line on the upper contour which represents an electron of the opposite spin , as shown in figure [ terrible diagram ] .",
    "we saw that there are essentially four ways of dressing the second order diagram with one bubble .",
    "moreover , we can dress the diagrams with two or even more , in general : @xmath118 , subsequent , non - intersecting , bubbles .",
    "an example is sketched in figure [ more bubbles ] . for the choice of each of these bubbles we have four possibilities .",
    "it might represent an electron of the same or the opposite spin and thus appear on the lower contour or represent a hole of the same spin or an electron of the opposite spin and appear on the upper contour .",
    "the sum of the contributions of all of these diagrams to the kernel element @xmath119 is @xmath120 @xmath121 where we replaced `` @xmath122 '' by `` @xmath123 '' .",
    "this summation of a geometric series can be justified for  large enough  values of @xmath40 .",
    "however , we are interested in the limit @xmath46 . for this",
    "we remember that we want to calculate the laplace - transform of the sum of the corresponding diagrams in the _ time space _ and let @xmath40 be complex .",
    "if the real part of @xmath40 is sufficiently large , say , @xmath124 , then the laplace transform of the sum of the diagrams in the time space is indeed given by the right hand side of the above equation .",
    "one can represent now the sum of the diagrams in the time space as the laplace back transform of this right hand side@xcite and in this way see that its laplace transform exists for all values of @xmath40 with strictly positive real part .",
    "the right hand side of the above equation , _ too _ , is holomorphic in @xmath40 on the whole half plane @xmath125 where the real part is positive .",
    "thus , we have _ two _ holomorphic functions on @xmath126 which are equal on @xmath127 .",
    "the theory of holomorphic functions says that they must be equal everywhere .",
    "all of the other second order diagrams can be dressed in the same way . for the diagrams connecting the particle numbers one and two we see that a support of the tunneling by holes and electrons of the same spin and by a hole of the opposite spin is possible , but not by an electron of the opposite spin .",
    "we obtain the following transition rates within this dressed second order approximation :    @xmath128 }   { \\pi^2 \\left [ ( \\alpha + \\alpha^+ ) ( \\varepsilon ) + \\alpha^+(e_{20 } - \\varepsilon ) \\right]^2   +   \\left [ \\varepsilon +   p_{\\alpha + \\alpha^+ } ( \\varepsilon ) - p_{\\alpha^+ } ( e_{20 } - \\varepsilon )   - e_{10 } \\right]^2   } ,   \\\\ \\label{dso transition rates 2 } \\gamma_{l,12}^\\pm & = & \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar } \\int d \\varepsilon \\frac { \\alpha_l^\\pm ( \\varepsilon )   \\left [ ( \\alpha + \\alpha^-)(\\varepsilon ) + \\alpha^- ( e_{20 } - \\varepsilon )     \\right ] }   { \\pi^2 \\left [ ( \\alpha + \\alpha^- ) ( \\varepsilon ) + \\alpha^-(e_{20 } - \\varepsilon )",

    "we thus expect that the second order rates are recovered when the temperature broadening of the functions @xmath133 largely exceeds the width of the lorentzian broadening . in the limit of weak coupling",
    "these transition rates indeed turn into the transition rates of the second order theory . more precisely , we get if we multiply the tunneling hamiltonian with a parameter @xmath48 as done in [ introduction of parameter w ] : @xmath134    the stationary reduced density matrix within the dso is given by eq .",

    "we assume different capacitive couplings of the levels to the leads and obtain that with growing asymmetry one of the peaks is changing position , getting wider and much less pronounced .",
    "the other one , however , is getting sharper ( figure [ capacitive_asymmetry ] ) .",
    "the explanation for this behavior at the level of the transition rates , eq .",
    "( [ b_field_transition_rates ] ) , is that @xmath211 changes considerably with the bias in regions where @xmath212 since then the region of large values of @xmath213 is leaving or entering the interval over which the integral essentially goes .",

    "the positions are no longer symmetric with respect to zero bias .",
    "moreover , we notice that also asymmetric tunnel coupling can have the effect that one of the resonances is getting less pronounced .",
    "one can let the coupling functions @xmath79 , eq .",

    "we introduce functions @xmath307 and @xmath308 in analogy to the above method and demand the corresponding property of @xmath166 of assumption ( [ further assumption about b ] ) .      for arbitrary @xmath185 , where the limit is given by the definition ( [ definition of g ] ) .",
    "in figure [ plot of g ] we plotted the function @xmath279 .",
    "already earlier we noticed that the dependence of @xmath310 on the temperature is logarithmic . by putting the two pieces of information together",
    "we can estimate : @xmath311 where @xmath312 is defined by the condition @xmath313 .",
    "we insert this into the integral ( [ technical integral ] ) and obtain : @xmath314 now we define a reference value for @xmath167 , `` @xmath315 '' , by the demand that the value of the second line is zero for @xmath316 .",
    "the integral ( [ technical integral ] ) has then the form @xmath317 where the definition of @xmath260 is @xmath318 with @xmath319    the corresponding integral in the formula for the linear conductance within the dso in the infinite - u case can be represented in an analogous way .",
    "the difference is that in the numerator we get @xmath320 instead of only @xmath321 .",

    "<S> we describe linear and nonlinear transport across a single impurity anderson model quantum dot with intermediate coupling to the leads , i.e. , with tunnel coupling of the order of the thermal energy @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling is large enough that sequential tunneling processes alone do not suffice to properly describe the transport characteristics . upon applying a density matrix approach , </S>",
    "<S> the current is expressed in terms of rates obtained by considering a very small class of diagrams which dress the sequential tunneling processes by charge fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we call this the `` dressed second order '' ( dso ) approximation </S>",
    "<S> . one major achievement of the dso is that , still in the coulomb blockade regime , it can describe the crossover from thermally broadened to tunneling broadened conductance peaks . </S>",
    "<S> when the temperature is decreased even further , the dso captures `` kondesque '' behaviours of the anderson quantum dot qualitatively : we find a zero bias anomaly of the differential conductance versus applied bias , an enhancement of the conductance with decreasing temperature as well as the onset of universality of the shape of the conductance as function of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we can address the case of a spin - degenerate level split energetically by a magnetic field and show that , if we assume in addition different capacitive couplings of the two spin - levels to the leads , one of the resonance peaks is vanishing . in case </S>",
    "<S> spin - dependent chemical potentials are introduced and only one of the four is varied , the dso yields _ in principle _ only one resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be in agreement with experiments with pseudo - spin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we get qualitative agreement with experimental data showing a cross - over from the kondo to the empty orbital regime . </S>"
