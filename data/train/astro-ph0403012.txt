    "supernovae provide an excellent opportunity for measuring extragalactic distances . the observations of these exploding stars using the best earth and space - based telescopes , a physical understanding of supernovae evolution , and sophisticated analyses of their spectra have led to the surprising conclusion that the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating ( perlmutter & schmidt 2003 ) .",
    "the upward trend of the magnitude versus redshift curve at high redshift is clear in figure 1 ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this departure from a linear or decelerating trend has been explained as eternal expansion with a positive cosmological constant and a current acceleration of expansion .",
    "this conclusion is based on a conventional interpretation of redshift as the result of photon wavelength increasing in an expanding friedmann universe .",
    "this was one idea originally suggested by hubble & tolman ( 1935 ) , but it is interesting to note that they concluded their paper with    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it also seemed desirable to express an open - minded position as to the true cause of the nebular red - shift , and to point out the indications that spatial curvature may have to play a part in the explanation of existing nebular data .",

    "it is the combination of changes in photons during their transit time and changes in atoms between the time of photon emission and later when they provide the wavelength standard , that defines redshift .",
    "the friedmann ( 1922 ) line element for the closed solution to einstein s ( 1916 ) theory of general relativity with no cosmological constant may be written    @xmath2.\\ ] ]    combined with electrodynamics , this gives the well - known result that photon wavelength @xmath3 evolves proportionally to the friedmann radius @xmath4 . in an expanding universe ,",
    "photon wavelengths increase in time and in a contracting universe , photon wavelengths decrease ,    @xmath5    schrdinger ( 1939 ) also derived this equation as an example of the coevolution of quantum wave functions with the curved spacetime of the closed friedmann universe .",
    "schrdinger found that the plane - wave eigenfunctions characteristic of flat spacetime are replaced in the curved spacetime of the friedmann universe by wave functions that are not precisely flat and that have wavelengths that are directly proportional to the friedmann radius @xmath4 .",
    "this means that eigenfunctions change wavelength as the radius of the universe changes and every quantum system they describe changes . in an expanding universe quantum systems expand . in a contracting universe",
    "they contract .",
    "an equation similar to ( 2 ) also describes the evolution of other quantum systems such as atoms , where @xmath6 is a measure of atomic size ( schrdinger 1939 , sumner & sumner 2000 ) .",
    "change in atomic size is directly related to change in the wavelengths of light that atoms emit .",
    "the shift in wavelength of a characteristic atomic emission @xmath7 due to coevolution is ( sumner 1994 )    @xmath8    taken together , equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) imply that redshift is observed only when the friedmann universe is contracting ( sumner 1994 ) .",
    "blueshifts are expected in an expanding universe .",
    "redshift @xmath9 is traditionally defined    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the assumed constant atomic emission and @xmath12 is the photon wavelength observed .",
    "making this traditional assumption that only photons evolve gives    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the current radius and @xmath15 was the radius at the time of emission .",
    "this definition must be reconsidered to account for the evolution of atomic emissions in addition to photon evolution .",
    "define redshift @xmath16 as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the wavelength emitted by today s reference atom and @xmath12 is the wavelength observed today from a distant source .",
    "experimental measurements actually determine the redshift @xmath16 , not @xmath9 .",
    "equation ( 6 ) is equivalent to    @xmath19    the mathematical coordinate distance @xmath20 is directly related to the observed redshift @xmath16 of a source and the deceleration parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the derivation parallels the one done when atomic evolution is ignored and the universe is assumed to be expanding ( narlikar 1993 ) , but differs because @xmath16 , not @xmath9 , describes the observed redshift and because some sign choices must be made differently when the cycloid parameter @xmath22 is in the third and fourth quadrants .",
    "if it is assumed that the observed photons were emitted after contraction began , @xmath20 is given by ( sumner & vityaev 2000 )    @xmath23 + \\frac{(1-q_o)}{q_o}\\left\\ { 1-\\left[k-\\frac{(1+k)(1- q_o)}{q_o}\\right]^2\\right\\}^{1/2 }   .\\ ] ]    luminosity distance @xmath24 is related to the observed flux @xmath25 and the intrinsic luminosity @xmath26 of the source by the equation @xmath27    the flux observed can be calculated by noting that the luminosity is decreased by a factor of @xmath28 due to the apparent decrease of the photon s energy and decreased by another factor of @xmath28 due to the changes in local time .",
    "the distance to the source is @xmath29 .",
    "this gives an observed flux of    @xmath30    comparing ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) gives    @xmath31    where equation ( 7 ) has been used .",
    "combining equations ( 8) and ( 11 ) and noting that    @xmath32    gives the desired result    @xmath33 +   \\\\ & + \\frac{(1-q_o)}{(2q_o-1)^{1/2}}\\left ( 1-\\left[k-\\frac{(1+k)(1- q_o)}{q_o}\\right]^2\\right)^{1/2}\\biggr\\}. \\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ]    equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) contain minus signs since @xmath34 is negative for contracting universes .",
    "recent determinations of the relationship between magnitude and redshift using supernovae have achieved an accuracy that can distinguish between various theoretical possibilities .",
    "the most important conclusion is that a conventional interpretation of redshift using an expanding friedmann metric and no cosmological constant is inconsistent with the data .",
    "figure 1 nicely illustrates this conclusion .    taking this same data set one ,",
    "can use equation ( 13 ) and vary @xmath34 and @xmath21 for a best fit .",
    "figure 2 illustrates a fit for the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the relationship between magnitude and luminosity distance    @xmath37    was used .",
    "figure 3 illustrates a similar fit for the most robust data set from knop et al .",
    "2003 , with values of @xmath38 and @xmath36 .",
    "a value of 19.27 was added to their values for @xmath39 which corresponds to using a value of @xmath40 to set the distance scale .",
    "this choice determines the best fit @xmath34 but has no other affect .",
    "for example , if 19.41 is added ( corresponding to @xmath41 ) the best fit is @xmath42 and @xmath36 , with no difference in the standard error .",
    "standard error , @xmath43 , is defined in the usual way as the root - mean - square of the differences , @xmath44 , between @xmath45 data and the value of equation ( 13 ) ,    @xmath46    the standard errors for both of these choices for @xmath34 with knop s data and for the fit to the data of riess have exactly the same value @xmath47 .",
    "this is comparable to the stated data errors .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the fit sensitivity to parameter choice .    the high redshift supernovae data of tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and barris et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are entirely consistent with these results",
    ". analyzed alone they are easy to fit , but neither @xmath34 nor @xmath21 are tightly constrained .",
    "when combined with lower redshift data , they have similar fits to the ones shown here .",

    "this estimate is good for @xmath21 close to @xmath56 but decreases to about 8 billion years when @xmath21 is close to @xmath57 .",
