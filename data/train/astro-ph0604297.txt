    "the quest for the main @xmath0 source(s ) started as soon as the first observational evidence of the presence of live @xmath0 in the inner galaxy was demonstrated by the heao 3 experiment @xcite and it still continues at the present days .",
    "its presence in the interstellar medium was not a surprise because it was theoretically predicted since the middle of the seventies that explosive ne / c burning in core collapse supernovae may produce such a nucleus @xcite .",
    "later on @xcite pointed out that @xmath0 may by injected into the interstellar medium also by wolf - rayet stars through stellar wind and since then a number of works have been devoted to the prediction of the amount @xmath0 ejected by these stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite and @xcite , on the basis of the theoretical models available at that time , proposed also the novae as main @xmath0 producers .",
    "all these candidates , with the further addition of the agb stars @xcite , could in principle account for a significant fraction of the observed flux due to the uncertainties in both the frequencies of the various candidates and the yields itself .",
    "@xcite were the first to point out that the lack of information about the distribution of the @xmath0 in the galaxy severely limits the possibility to identify the main @xmath0 donor(s ) .",
    "a clear snapshot of the situation just before the launch of the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) is provided by the @xcite review paper .",
    "the launch of the cgro in 1991 , and its continuous operation up to 2001 , allowed the first mapping of the 1809 kev line all over the galaxy and put firm constraints on the possible main sources of @xmath0 . by the way ,",
    "the latest all - sky map has been published by @xcite .",
    "this observational campaign showed beyond any doubt that the @xmath0 distribution was strongly confined towards the galactic disk and quite clumpy and asymmetric , strongly pushing towards a massive star parent for the bulk of the @xmath0 .",
    "we refer the reader to the reviews by @xcite and @xcite for an excellent clear picture of the scenarios that were under debate as soon as the first results from comptel aboard the cgro became available .",
    "a further milestone progress in the identification of the main @xmath0 producers was obtained when the @xmath0 map was compared to a series of all sky maps obtained at various wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite found that the 53 ghz microwave free- free emission all - sky map was the only one to almost perfectly overlap the @xmath0 all - sky map .",
    "the 53 ghz free - free emission line maps the regions of ionized gas and such a sustained ionization may be powered only by the lyman continuum photons provided by the very massive stars and disappears on a timescale of 1 myr after the switch off of the lyman continuum `` lamp '' .",
    "hence the existence of such a good overlap between the two all - sky maps demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that the bulk of the @xmath0 is produced in the same regions where massive stars are present .",
    "such a finding did not close at all the quest of the @xmath0 progenitors but it simply shifted such a quest towards which subclass of massive stars do mainly contribute to the @xmath0 budget .",
    "the two classical competing candidates were identified as the type ii supernovae and the wolf rayet ( wr ) stars ( through the stellar wind ) . a further question concerned",
    "the possibility , sometimes suggested , that a consistent fraction of the 1.8 mev @xmath3-flux ( @xmath4 ) were due to close localized sources and not to galaxy wide sources .",
    "such a doubt was mainly due to the fact that the massive star census in the galaxy is well known only out to distances of a few kiloparsecs and many regions of the galaxy are obscured for direct measurements .",
    "this problem was recently definitely solved by spi(integral ) @xcite that measured for the first time with great accuracy the doppler shift of the @xmath0 line along the inner galaxy clearly demonstrating that the @xmath0 corotates with the galaxy , hence supporting a galaxy - wide origin .",
    "the total amount of @xmath0 present in the disk of our galaxy has been estimated by assuming a variety of distributions of the @xmath0 sources and it ranges between 1 and 3 @xmath11 .",
    "together with the search for a signal from the decay of @xmath0 , also a signal from another gamma ray emitter , namely @xmath1 , has been searched for thoroughly .",
    "the production of this nucleus has been historically attributed to the ne explosive burning in core collapse supernovae @xcite , hence it has always been considered as the litmus paper to discriminate among the various candidates as major @xmath0 contributors . unfortunately , all the experiments up to 2002 could only provide upper limits on the abundance of this nucleus in the interstellar medium . with the launch of the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) and of the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) the situation changed drastically since both rhessi and spi aboard integral were able to measure an @xmath1 signal from the inner radiant of our galaxy .",
    "the latest simultaneous measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 performed by rhessi and spi at the time of writing give a @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 @xmath3-ray line flux ratio equal to @xmath8 ( rhessi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath9 ( spi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "the theoretical models that constitute the base of the various interpretations of these data may be divided in two broad categories : the first one includes stars less massive than , say , 35 - 40@xmath2and a second one that includes the more massive stars .",
    "this limiting mass roughly marks the minimum mass that becomes a wr star .",
    "the evolution of the stars in the first group has been extensively explored through all the hydrostatic burnings up to the core collapse together with the following explosive burnings .",
    "yields for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been published , for this mass range , over the years by several groups @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the stars in the upper mass range , which spend part of their lifetime as wr stars , have never been followed all along their full evolution ( and final explosion ) but only through the h and he burning ( plus , quite recently , the central c burning ) phases ; obviously also the explosive burnings of these very massive stars have never been addressed . as a consequence of this very biased knowledge of the evolution of these very massive stars , only the fraction of @xmath0 yield ejected by the stellar wind has been predicted up to now ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and unfortunately quite often this partial prediction has been interpreted as the total @xmath0 yield produced by these very massive stars . in other words , it has become a deep - seated notion that the stars that do not become wr contribute to both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields while those that become wr do contribute only to the synthesis of the @xmath0 . within this accepted framework",
    ", an `` observed '' @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio of 0.11 - 0.17 would favor the masses that do not become wr as the main producers of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ww95 models do predict a @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio of 0.18 ( averaged over a power law imf - @xmath12 - ranging between 11 and 40@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , more recent models @xcite do predict much larger @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratios ( 0.5- 1.0 ) , leaving therefore plenty of room for an important contribution of the wr stars to the synthesis of the @xmath0 . for sake of completeness , it must be mentioned that @xcite published the presupernova evolution and explosive yields of massive pure he cores that should be associated to wr stars . however , unfortunately , these bare cores can hardly be reconciled with a population of ( single ) wr stars because all of them correspond to models that lose the h - rich mantle before the central he ignition while consistent models of massive stars with mass loss ( see below ) show that this happens only in stars more massive than 80 @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    "we completely reanalyze and rediscuss the interpretation of the observed fluxes of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the light of a new large grid of massive star models of solar metallicity with mass loss .",
    "these homogeneous sets of models extend in mass between 11 and 120@xmath2and cover the full hydrostatic evolution from the main sequence up to the core collapse together with the following explosive burnings .",
    "these models will be published shortly . given the importance of the problems connected with the @xmath3 ray emitters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we think that it is worth dedicating a full paper to them .",
    "we are aware that these models are just solar metallicity models and that it would be important to have supersolar models too , but we think that the availability of a full set of models from 11 to 120@xmath2covering all the hydrostatic and explosive burnings is already a big step forward in the understanding of these nuclei .",
    "we also address the fit to @xmath10 velorum , the closest wr star .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , the new set of models is briefly presented , then two distinct sections discuss separately the theoretical yields of these two nuclei as a function of the initial mass .",
    "their dependence on the mass loss rate adopted in the wne+wco phase is addressed in section 5 .",
    "a discussion of the scenarios that comes out from the adoption of these new yields and a final brief conclusion follow .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields used in the present paper have been extracted from a new generation of stellar models that will be available soon .",
    "these new models have been computed with the latest release ( 5.050218 ) of the franec ( frascati raphson newton evolutionary code ) . by the way , from now on the release number",
    "will follow the following convention : the integer part of the number refers to the major release ( the fifth at present ) while its decimal part refers to the date in which it has been released , in the form yymmdd .",
    "the main features of this new release , with respect to that described in @xcite , are the following .",
    "first of all the convective mixing and the nuclear burning are coupled together and solved simultaneously .",
    "more specifically , the set of equations describing the chemical evolution of the matter are now :    @xmath14\\ ] ]    where the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 , the convective velocity @xmath17 is computed by means of the mixing length theory and @xmath18 is the mixing lenght parameter .",
    "this set of equations is linearized and solved by means of a raphson newton technique .",
    "let us also remind that , as in all our computations , the nuclear energy generation rate is always computed with the same , full , network adopted to describe the chemical evolution of the matter , without any kind of approximation .",
    "the network adopted in the present computations is the same as in @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 of overshooting has been assumed at the top of the convective core in central h burning .",
    "the nuclear cross sections have been updated with respect to those adopted in @xcite whenever possible .",
    "table [ tabele ] shows the full reference matrix of all the processes taken into account in the network , together with its proper legend .",
    "note that for the weak interaction rates , @xmath20 and @xmath21 mean the sum of both the electron capture and the @xmath20 decay and the positron capture and the @xmath21 decay , respectively .",
    "the dependence on the temperature of the weak interaction rates has been considered following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , see table [ tabele ] .",
    "the @xmath22 requires a special treatment since the ground ( alg6 entry in table [ tabele ] ) @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and the isomeric states ( alm6 entry in table [ tabele ] ) @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) do not come into statistical equilibrium for temperatures @xmath29 @xcite . for this reason we treat the ground and isomeric states of @xmath22 as separate species for @xmath30 while we assume the two states to be in statistical equilibrium ( and hence consider just one isotope ) above this temperature . by the way , the al26 entry in table [ tabele ] refers to the total amount of @xmath22 .",
    "mass loss has been included following the prescriptions of @xcite for the blue supergiant phase ( @xmath31 ) , @xcite for the red supergiant phase ( @xmath32 ) and @xcite for the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "additional models have been computed with the @xcite mass loss rate in the wne+wco phases .",
    "the explosion of the mantle of the star is started by imparting istantaneously an initial velocity @xmath33 to a mass coordinate of @xmath34 of the presupernova model , i.e. , well within the iron core .",
    "the propagation of the shock wave is computed by means of an explosive simulation code , developed by us , that solves the fully compressible reactive hydrodynamic equations using the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of @xcite in the lagrangean form .",
    "@xmath33 is properly tuned in order to eject all the mass above the fe core .",
    "the chemical evolution of the matter is computed by coupling the same nuclear network adopted in the hydrostatic calculations to the system of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the nuclear energy generation is not taken into account in these simulations since we assume that it is always negligible with respect to both the kinetic and the internal energies . by taking advantage of the fact that the final yields mainly depend on the mass cut location ( the mass coordinate that separates the ejecta from the compact remnant ) and only mildly on the properties of the parametrized explosion",
    ", yields corresponding to different amounts of @xmath35 ejected can be easily obtained by fixing the mass cut by hand a posteriori @xcite . here , for each star , we chose the mass cut in order to obtain @xmath36 of @xmath37 ejected . by the way ,",
    "let us note that since both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are synthesized in quite external regions , their final yields do not depend on the particular choice of the mass cut since we assume in any case that at least a minimum amount of @xmath40 is ejected .",
    "all these solar models has been computed by adopting an initial he abundance equal to 0.285 ( by mass fraction ) , a global metallicity z@xmath410.02 ( by mass fraction ) - the relative abundances among the various nuclear species are taken from the @xcite solar distribution .",
    "they range in mass between 11@xmath2and 120@xmath2 , covering therefore the full range of masses that are expected to give rise to the type ii / ib / ic supernovae as well as to the wr populations . these models and the corresponding full",
    "set of yields will be published , and discussed , shortly ; for the moment we anticipate a few basic properties in table [ taba ] .",

    "@xmath0 is an unstable nucleus ( its terrestrial half life is @xmath49 ) produced almost exclusively by proton capture on @xmath50 .",
    "its synthesis occurs , in massive stars , essentially in three different specific environments , i.e. , the core h burning , the c and ne convective shells and the explosive ne burning .",
    "let us discuss each of these environments separately .",
    "all over the mass range presently analyzed , @xmath0 is produced in main sequence by the @xmath50(p,@xmath3)@xmath0 reaction ( hereinafter mg25pg ) and mainly destroyed by the @xmath51 decay into @xmath52 since the competing destruction process , i.e. the @xmath0(p,@xmath3)@xmath53 process , becomes efficient for @xmath54 k and only our most massive model barely reaches such a temperature towards the end of the central h burning .",
    "the conversion of the initial abundance of @xmath50 into @xmath0 starts as soon as a star settles on the main sequence ( since @xmath55 k ) and comes to completion on a timescale of few million years , i.e. well within the central h burning lifetime .",
    "figure [ al26temporal ] shows the temporal evolution of the @xmath0 mass fraction in the h convective core : a maximum is reached shortly after the beginning of the central h burning , followed by a progressive decrease mainly due to the @xmath51 decay . since @xmath0 continues to be produced also after the maximum ,",
    "its decline is shallower than that of a pure decay ( shown in figure [ al26temporal ] as the cyan dot - dashed line ) . by the way , it is such a prolonged production that preserves some @xmath0 in the h convective core up to the end of the central h burning .",
    "in fact , if the slope of the decline would follow a pure decay after the maximum , essentially all the @xmath0 would decay by the time the star exhausts the h in the center .",
    "the solid , long dashed , dotted and short dashed lines refer to the 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 @xmath2 , respectively .    since the efficiency of the mg25pg reaction rate scales directly with the initial mass , the larger the initial mass the higher the maximum @xmath0 mass fraction abundance , the faster the @xmath50 consumption and hence the faster the @xmath0 decline .",
    "hence , if the efficiency of the mg25pg were the only parameter to control the scaling of the @xmath0 mass fraction abundance at the central h exhaustion with the initial mass of the star , one should obtain an inverse scaling of the central @xmath0 mass fraction at the central h exhaustion with the mass .",
    "vice versa the models show a strong direct scaling .",
    "such a result is the obvious consequence of the strong shortening of the central h burning lifetime with the initial mass that freezes the central @xmath0 abundance progressively at earlier times ( and hence at higher abundances ) .",
    "of course , a direct scaling between the @xmath0 mass fraction and the initial mass of a star does not imply , by itself , a direct scaling between the total amount of @xmath0 ( in solar masses ) produced by the h burning and the initial mass .",
    "in fact , it is the size of the convective core that really determines how much @xmath0 is produced in total , and since it scales directly with the initial mass , the direct scaling between @xmath0 produced and initial mass is secured .    at central h exhaustion ,",
    "the @xmath0 is located both in the he core and in the region of variable h left behind by the receding convective core .",
    "since the he burning easily and quickly destroys the @xmath0 ( via the @xmath56 and @xmath57 reactions - the neutrons being released by the @xmath58 process ) the amount of @xmath0 synthesized by central h burning and really preserved up to the explosion is just the one located in the h rich layers plus the one locked in the fraction of the he core that will not be affected by the he burning .",
    "if the dredge up and the mass loss were not effective , this @xmath0 would be ejected all together by the explosion , while the occurrence of these two phenomena may anticipate such an ejection at earlier times and also increase the amount of @xmath0 ejected into the interstellar medium . in our models three mass intervals may be identified : 1 ) stars between 11 @xmath2and 30 @xmath2undergo a dredge up episode that does not enter into the he core and the mass loss is weak enough that all these stars end their life with an h - rich envelope ; since the he convective shell extends almost up to the base of the h burning shell , only the tiny amount of @xmath0 present in the region of variable h left by the receding h convective core and engulfed in the convective envelope is ejected in the interstellar medium .",
    "2 ) stars between 35@xmath2and 40@xmath2 experience a dredge up episode that does not enter the he core as well , but the mass loss is strong enough that also a fraction of the he core is ejected outward ; since the mass loss erodes the he core before the formation of the he convective shell , the @xmath0 present in these layers is preserved by the destruction and goes to increase the amount of @xmath0 ejected in the interstellar medium .",
    "3 ) stars more massive than 40@xmath2do not show any dredge up episode and the mass loss is so strong that a substantial fraction of the he core is ejected through the stellar wind ; as a consequence a larger amount of @xmath0 present in the he core is preserved from the destruction and ejected .",
    "as for the first two mass intervals , the wind starts expelling @xmath0 as soon as the star becomes a red ( super)giant .",
    "vice versa , stars in the upper mass interval begin to eject @xmath0 only when the total mass of the star reduces enough that layers processed by the h burning are exposed to the surface ( i.e. when the star becomes a wr ) .",
    "let us eventually note that only a very tiny fraction of the original @xmath50 is ejected in the interstellar medium as @xmath0(mainly because of the substantial @xmath0 decay during the core h burning ) and also that this @xmath0 is of semi - secondary origin since only the @xmath50 depends on the initial metallicity z and obviously not the protons ( the true secondary nuclei are the ones formed by reactions in which both the target and the projectile depend on the initial metallicity , for example , as in the s process production ) . figure [ al26 ] shows , as green diamonds , the amount of @xmath0 expelled through the stellar wind as a function of the initial mass ; the observed trend is the obvious consequence of what has been discussed above , i.e. , it is the result of the direct scaling of ( 1 ) the size of the h convective core , ( 2 ) the @xmath0 mass fraction left by the central h burning and ( 3 ) the mass loss efficiency with the initial mass .",
    "once the star moves beyond the central h burning , the `` habitat '' becomes very hostile to the survival of @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , how already mentioned above , the he burning simply destroys @xmath0 through neutron captures .",
    "second , the half life of @xmath0 has a tremendous dependence on the temperature : it reduces to @xmath59 yr already at @xmath60 , to @xmath61 h at @xmath62 , and to @xmath63 m in the range @xmath64 .",
    "third , efficient photodisintegration quickly destroy @xmath0 when the temperature raises above , say , @xmath65 .",
    "such a temperature limit obviously constrains a possible @xmath0 production to the c and/or ne burning shells .    as for the c shell",
    ", its typical temperature ( @xmath66 ) does not allow in general a substantial production of @xmath0 .",
    "however , after the central si burning , the strong contraction ( and heating ) of the inner core that precedes the final gravitational collapse , induces a strong temperature increase of the c burning shell ( up to , roughly , @xmath67 ) .",
    "if , at this stage , such a burning occurs in an efficient convective shell , a substantial amount of @xmath0 is produced .",
    "let us discuss such a production in a more detailed way .",
    "the processes that produce and destroy @xmath0 in these conditions are once again the mg25pg and the beta decay .",
    "the mg25pg reaction rate depends on the mg25pg cross section but also on the abundances of @xmath50 and protons .",
    "the @xmath50 that now enters in the @xmath0 production comes directly from the initial cno abundance , via the sequence @xmath68@xmath69@xmath70@xmath71@xmath70@xmath50 while the protons are mainly produced by the @xmath72(@xmath72,p)@xmath73 and the @xmath73(@xmath74,p)@xmath52 processes . by the way ,",
    "note that the main proton poison is not the @xmath50 but , instead , the @xmath73 through the ( p,@xmath74 ) channel .",
    "the high temperature influences the @xmath0 production either because it raises the mg25pg cross section but also because it strongly increases the proton density by increasing the cross sections of both the processes that provide the bulk of protons . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a convective environment is also crucial because it continuously brings fresh @xmath72 and @xmath50 where the @xmath0 production occurs and simultaneously brings the freshly made @xmath0 to much lower temperatures where its lifetime increases enormously .    at variance with the c burning , @xmath0",
    "is always produced by the ne burning ( both in the center and in the shell ) .",
    "a substantial amount of @xmath50 is left unburned by the c burning and the protons needed to activate the @xmath75 reaction mainly come from the @xmath76 reaction ( @xmath77 being one of the products of c burning ) , the @xmath78 being provided by the @xmath79 photodisintegration .",
    "again , the most effective protons poison is the @xmath80 . in a radiative environment",
    "the @xmath0 `` equilibrium '' abundance depends on the local balance between production and destruction so that , as soon as the @xmath81 photodisintegration weakens for lack of fuel , the abundance of the @xmath78 drops as well and the proton production channels dry up : no more @xmath0 may be produced and its short lifetime at these high temperatures leads quickly to its total destruction .",
    "once again only the presence of an efficient convective shell could act as a preservation buffer . since most of the stars do not reach the onset of the explosion with an efficient ne convective shell , in general only the small equilibrium abundance of @xmath0 located within the radiative ne burning shell is present at the beginning of the core collapse .",
    "there are two exceptions : the 14 and the 15 @xmath82 models .",
    "stars within this mass interval are characterized by the lack of a c convective shell , at the end of the central si burning , and by the formation of a ne convective shell very close to the region where it was previously efficient a carbon convective shell . during the last strong contraction of the core that precedes the final collapse ,",
    "such a ne convective shell penetrates the c rich region with the consequence of producing a huge amount of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 synthesized in the c ( or ne / c ) convective shell is located close enough to the iron core that is partially destroyed by the passage of the shock wave . in general , the larger the mass the larger the amount of @xmath0 that survives the explosion ( table [ tabb ] ) .",
    "the blue triangles in figure [ al26 ] show the @xmath0 yield produced in this convective shell that survived to the explosion as a function of the initial mass .",
    "the general increase of this yield with the mass depends on the fact that both the mass size and the peak temperature of the c ( or ne / c ) convective shell scale directly with the mass .",
    "the peak around the 15@xmath2model , as already discussed above , is due to the presence of an extended ne convective shell that engulfs part of the c rich region .",
    "the minimum yield around the 30@xmath2is the natural consequence of the lack of an active c ( and ne ) convective shell at the moment of the explosion .",
    "the @xmath0 produced by the c and/or ne shell is of semi - secondary origin ( as the one produced by the h burning ) because the @xmath50 is secondary while protons are primary .",
    "@xmath0 is also produced during the explosion at a typical temperature of the order of @xmath83 billion degrees .",
    "such a condition occurs within the c convective shell and the main process that controls its production is once again the mg25pg process while its destruction is now controlled , roughly parithetically , by the @xmath84 and @xmath85 processes .",
    "the @xmath50 now comes mainly from the @xmath86 capture on @xmath87 , this isotope being a primary outcome of the c and ne burning .",
    "the neutron density that enters in both the production and destruction of @xmath0 is determined by the competition among several processes : the main neutron producers are @xmath88 captures on @xmath52 , @xmath50 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 plus the @xmath91 capture on @xmath92 while the main neutron poisons are the @xmath86 captures on @xmath87 , @xmath93 and @xmath81 . the proton density that enters the mg25pg rate",
    "is mainly determined by the competition between the production that occurs via the @xmath94 captures on @xmath81 , @xmath87 , @xmath95 and @xmath73 and the destruction that occurs via the @xmath96 capture on @xmath52 , @xmath81 , @xmath87 , @xmath95 , @xmath50 , @xmath97 plus the @xmath91 reaction on @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ al26 ] shows the contribution of the explosive burning to the synthesis of @xmath0 as filled red squares . to understand the trend of the explosive yield with the mass it is necessary to remind that the final mass radius ( mr ) relation at the moment of the core collapse plays a fundamental role for the synthesis of many nuclei , because it mainly determines the amount of matter exposed to the various explosive burnings @xcite .",
    "such a relation strongly depends on the behavior of the c , ne and o shell burnings all along the evolution of a star .",
    "the general rule is that the stronger is a shell burning , the slower is the contraction and hence the shallower is the final mr relation ; it is also worth reminding that a stronger shell burning usually implies a wider ( in mass ) convective shell .",
    "figure [ mara ] shows the final mr relation for a subset of stars in the present grid . by the way ,",
    "since the blast wave is essentially radiation dominated , the spatial location where the peak temperature drops to , say , 2.3 billion degrees occurs around 0.01 - 0.02 @xmath98 , the exact value depending ( quite mildly ) on the explosion energy .",
    "the figure clearly shows that there is a non monotonic dependence on the initial mass : though a general trend exists , in the sense that the larger the mass the steeper this relation , two inversions exist : the first one between 17@xmath2and 20@xmath2and the second one between 30@xmath2and 35@xmath2 .",
    "the first inversion marks the first mass ( 20@xmath2 ) forming a very extended last c convective shell that slows down the gravitational contraction of the core and hence halts the direct scaling between the compactness of the inner layers and the initial mass .",
    "the second inversion , occurring around the 35@xmath2model , marks the minimum mass that forms a single well settled c convective shell that lasts up to the explosion .",
    "also in this case the formation of a single very active c convective shell counterbalances the increase in the gravitational contraction induced by the increase of the total mass .",
    "the explosive yields shown in figure [ al26 ] follow almost exactly the general trend shown by the mr relation : there is a general direct scaling between the explosive @xmath0 and the initial mass , but with two minima corresponding to the two masses quoted above .    the black dots in figure [ al26 ] show the total yield of @xmath0 as a function of the initial mass .",
    "it is quite evident that for the largest majority of the stars in the present mass range @xmath99 the explosive component is the major contributor to the total yield . only around 15@xmath2the @xmath0 produced in the advanced hydrostatic burnings",
    "dominates the final yield .",
    "the wind component to the total is always negligible up to a mass of , say , 60@xmath2 . above this mass",
    ", it contributes to roughly 30% of the global outcome .",
    "note , however , that though the explosive burning is the overall major producer of @xmath0 within the full initial mass interval presently analyzed , the @xmath0 produced by both the h burning and the c / ne shell can not be ignored in the computation of the final budget of @xmath0 produced by a generation of massive stars .",
    "there are many quite uncertain basic stellar parameters that may significantly alter the final @xmath0 yields shown in figure [ al26 ] .",
    "we have explored a few of them :    \\1 ) the adopted initial @xmath50 abundance ( usually scaled solar ) constitutes the main buffer from which the @xmath0 is produced in ms and a change of its initial ( assumed ) abundance reflects linearly on the final amount of @xmath0 ejected by the wind . in other words ,",
    "a doubling of the initial @xmath50 leads to a doubling of the @xmath0 ejected through the wind .",
    "\\2 ) the size of the h convective core certainly plays a pivotal role since it affects both directly and indirectly the final @xmath0 yield .",
    "the direct influence occurs in ms because it contributes to determine its abundance , by mass fraction , as well as its distribution within the star at the end of the core h burning ; the indirect influence occurs through its major role in determining the he core mass , which is the main parameter driving all the further evolution of a star . in order to study the dependence of the @xmath0 yield on the size of the h convective core we recomputed the full presupernova evolution plus the explosive burning of a 60 and a 120@xmath2by adopting 0.5 hp of overshooting ( instead of the basic 0.2 hp ) in core h burning .",
    "the main results are shown in the last two rows of table [ taba ] and table [ tabb ] .",
    "the first thing worth noting is that the increase of the size of the h convective core has two opposite effects on the two masses : the total @xmath0 yield increases by 18% in the 60@xmath2while it remains roughly constant in the 120@xmath2 .",
    "a closer look to the various components shows that the wind component reduces by 16% in the 60@xmath2while it increases by 24% in the 120@xmath2 .",
    "the sum of the other two components shows , on the other hand , the opposite trend , i.e. it increases in the smaller mass and reduces in the larger one .",
    "such results are the consequence of a complex interplay among several phenomena .",
    "first of all an increase of the convective core has two opposite effects : it increases the region where the initial @xmath50 is converted in @xmath0 but it also leads to a lower @xmath0 abundance by mass fraction at the core h exhaustion ( because the h - burning lifetime increases ) .",
    "the final balance between these two opposite phenomena is not predictable a priori , but it happens that the first effect prevails on the second one so that at last more @xmath0 ( in solar masses ) is produced overall .",
    "however , such an occurrence is not sufficient to determine how the @xmath0 wind component depends on the size of the convective core because another crucial role is played by mass loss : a change of the size of the convective core strongly affects the path followed by a star in the hr diagram and hence the total amount of mass it loses . in the 60@xmath2case ,",
    "the standard and test models lose similar amounts of mass in ms ; however , while the standard model spends a consistent fraction of the central he burning phase as a red supergiant where it loses a very large amount of mass , the model with the larger convective core moves much earlier to the blue where the average mass loss rates are significantly lower .",
    "the final result is that the test model loses less mass , reaching the final collapse with a total mass of 19.93@xmath2 , i.e. 2.8@xmath2 more than the standard case .",
    "this explains why the test 60@xmath2ejects less @xmath0 through the wind than its standard counterpart . in the 120@xmath2case",
    "the opposite happens : the test model loses much more mass than the standard model : in fact its final mass is 26.83@xmath2 , i.e. 4@xmath2less than the standard model . in this specific case",
    "the luminosity increase in central h burning ( due to the increase of the convective core ) allows the model to enter ( for a consistent amount of time ) a region of the hr diagram where mass loss is very efficient ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this explains why the amount of @xmath0 present in the wind is larger in the test than in the standard model . as for the @xmath0 produced by the advanced ( c / ne ) burnings plus the explosion",
    ", we found that these components scale directly with the size of the convective core in the 60@xmath2and inversely in the 120@xmath2 .",
    "the reason is simply that the amount of @xmath0 produced both in the advanced and in the ne explosive burnings scale directly with the size of the he core mass , and table [ taba ] shows that this parameter increases with the size of the convective core in the 60@xmath2 , while it decreases in the 120@xmath2case : this last ( apparently ) unexpected result is due to the strong increase of the mass loss rate in the 120 @xmath2stellar model computed with 0.5 hp of overshooting .",
    "\\3 ) we have also explored the influence of the mg25pg cross section on the @xmath0 produced by the h burning and expelled through the wind .",
    "though the uncertainty quoted for this process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is of the order of a factor of 2 in the temperature range @xmath100 , we preferred to explore the general theoretical dependence of the @xmath0 ( ejected by the wind ) on the mg25pg cross section in a range of values wider than ( presently ) expected .",
    "hence we have performed a few tests on both the 60@xmath2and the 120@xmath2by multiplying and dividing this cross section by a factor of 3 and 10 .",
    "table [ tabc ] shows the results of these tests in the first four rows : the first column shows the cross section adopted in the test while the forth and fifth columns show the amount of @xmath0 ( in solar masses ) present in the wind for the 60@xmath2and the 120@xmath2star models , respectively .",
    "these tests show that a ) the amount of @xmath0 ejected by the wind does not scale monotonically with the efficiency of this cross section but , instead , that it firstly increases as the cross section decreases and then it begins to decrease when the cross section drops below @xmath101 of the reference one , and b ) the amount of @xmath0 ejected by the wind depends only mildly on a systematic variation of the cross section , since it varies by less than a factor of two over a huge variation of the mg25pg cross section . to understand these results it is necessary to analyze in more details the synthesis of @xmath0 in h burning . in the following",
    "we will discuss the behavior of the 60@xmath2but the same analysis does hold over the full mass range presently analyzed . figure [ al26time ]",
    "shows the variation of the abundance of the @xmath0 in the convective core as a function of time for the five values of the cross section : the red sparse dotted line refers to the case in which the enhancement factor ( ef ) of the standard cross section is 10 , the blue long dashed one to an ef=3 , the black solid line to the standard case , the green short dashed line to an ef=1/3 while the magenta short dotted line refers to an ef=0.1 .",
    "the test with the highest enhancement factor simulates the extreme case in which the @xmath50 is completely converted in @xmath0 just at the beginning of the h burning . in this case",
    "the maximum @xmath0 abundance is the highest but also the following decline is the steepest ( it practically follows a pure decay ) because no more @xmath50 is left to feed the @xmath0 abundance at late times . as the enhancement factor reduces , the maximum equilibrium abundance of the @xmath0 drops accordingly while the final @xmath0 abundance progressively increases due to the larger availability of @xmath50 at late time .",
    "this trend , however , naturally comes to an end when the cross section becomes so slow that the timescale over which @xmath50 converts in @xmath0 becomes longer than the h burning timescale . at this point the final abundance of @xmath0 is mainly controlled by the total amount of @xmath50 destroyed : the lower the rate , the smaller the amount of @xmath50 converted in @xmath0 and hence the smaller its final abundance .",
    "a cross section 10 times lower than our standard case is low enough to enter such a regime . by the way",
    ", it goes without saying that the physical evolution of the star does not depend at all on the rate of this process , so that all the timescales , the amount of mass lost , the penetration of the dredge up and so on remain rigorously identical in all these tests .",
    "\\4 ) since most of the @xmath0 ejected in the interstellar medium is anyway synthesized by the passage of the shock wave , we have also explored its sensitivity to the rates of the processes involved in its production in ne explosive burning .",
    "of course the number of factors that may influence the explosive production of @xmath0 is very large and includes also all the factors that may affect the final mass - radius relation ( as , e.g. , the @xmath102 ) ; such a deep analysis goes well beyond the purposes of this paper .",
    "we have explored the influence of a few rates , namely the two main processes involved in the synthesis of @xmath0 , i.e. the @xmath103 and the @xmath104 , as well as the two processes that control its destruction , i.e. the @xmath105 and the @xmath106 .",
    "in particular we have recomputed three explosions for the two masses 25 and 60@xmath2 , the first one doubling the cross sections of both the neutron captures on @xmath0 , a second one doubling the n capture on @xmath87 and a last one by doubling the mg25pg .",
    "the results are shown in rows 8 to 11 in table [ tabc ] .",
    "since the efficiency of any process depends on its rate ( i.e. the cross section times the abundances of the involved nuclei ) rather than just on its cross section , the tests shown in table [ tabc ] may also be reinterpreted as due to a change by a factor of two of any of the two nuclear species involved in the given process .",
    "this means that the tests concerning in particular the influence of the @xmath103 , the @xmath105 and the @xmath107 on the explosive synthesys of the @xmath0 , may also be seen as tests in which it is the neutron density to have been increased by a factor of two .",
    "since a doubling of the @xmath103 rate increase the explosive @xmath0 by roughly 60% while the simultaneous doubling of both the @xmath105 and the @xmath107 rates reduces the @xmath0 by roughly 40% , it is clear that the two effects almost cancel out , so that we feel confident to conclude that a changing of the neutron density plays a minor role on the explosive synthesys of the @xmath0 .",
    "let us stress here , as a general warning , that the neutron and proton equilibrium abundances that enter in the various processes depend on the balance among a variety of similarly efficient processes , so that all of them should be carefully checked in order to understand if these equilibrium abundances are reliable or not .",
    "let us eventually explicitly mention other important sources of uncertainty that could affect the @xmath0 yield :    \\a ) the c abundance left by the he burning provides the main fuel that feeds both the c and the ne burning ( whose abundance derives directly from the c one ) and hence it regulates the birth and the development of all the convective shells and hence , in turn , the final mr relation . unfortunately ,",
    "as it is well known , this value is not firmly established because it depends on the still very uncertain cross section of the @xmath72(@xmath74,@xmath3)@xmath93 process together with the adopted mixing scheme in central he burning .",
    "\\b ) we have shown how critical the presence of a convective shell and the efficiency of mixing is to preserve the @xmath0 produced in the c ( ne / c ) burning shell ; any change in their mass size and/or in the efficiency of mixing could significantly alter their contribution to the total yield ( see also weaver & woosley 1993 ) .",
    "it goes without saying that only the computation of a series of evolutionary tracks may really provide a quantitative estimate of these additional important uncertainties .    before closing this section",
    "let us compare our final yields with the other ones available in the literature .",
    "we already published yields for @xmath0 in 2003 and 2004 @xcite ; those yields ( the @xmath0 ones only ) , unfortunately , must be totally disregarded since , when we updated the full set of cross sections adopted in the evolutionary code , we found that the @xmath108 cross section present in the reaclib database , and based on the @xcite formula , was wrong .",
    "figure [ conf1al26 ] shows the @xmath0 yields by ww95 ( green filled squares ) , @xcite ( cyan filled triangles ) , @xcite ( magenta filled rhombs ) , @xcite ( red open dots ) , @xcite ( magenta open squares ) and @xcite ( green open rhombs ) together with the present ones ( marked as `` this paper '' - blue filled dots ) .",
    "the first thing worth noting is that our set of models is the only one that fully extends over the full range of the massive stars .",
    "how we have already said above , for historical reasons two parallel fields of research may be identified : the first one ( mainly involving woosley and coauthors ) , addressed the full evolution of stellar models ( including the computation of the passage of the shock wave ) but did not extend the explored mass interval above 35 - 40@xmath2and a second one ( that includes mainly european groups ) involved in the study of the central h and he burning phases in a wide mass interval ( up to 120@xmath2 ) by including the mass loss and hence fully exploring the properties of the wr stars .",
    "the ww95 @xmath0 yields show remarkable similarities with ours : both sets of yields show two maxima , a first one around 15 - 20@xmath2and a second one around 30 - 35@xmath2 , the ww95 ones being slightly shifted towards more massive stars .",
    "we already discussed above how these two peaks are related to the temporal evolution of the c convective shell , and hence these strong similarities clearly point towards a quite similar presupernova evolution .",
    "the quite larger ww95 yields between 25 and 40@xmath2are probably at least partially due to the contribution of the @xmath109 process that we neglect . ww95 quote the @xmath0 yield for the 25@xmath2without the @xmath109 contribution and the value closely matches our yield .",
    "the @xcite yields are an upgrade of the ww95 for the solar metallicity ; note that they do not show any more a strong peak around a 20@xmath2 , which means that something in the properties of the c convective shell has changed with respect to the older ww95 stellar models .",
    "anyway , we feel confident to say that these three sets of yields lead to quite similar predictions .",
    "an additional set of yields for this mass interval was provided by @xcite : these yields are much lower than all the other ones probably because they come from the evolution of just pure he cores computed by adopting a quite poor network in the hydrostatic burnings . historically , stars more massive than , say , 35@xmath2 have been studied almost exclusively up to the end of the central he burning , so that only the @xmath0 present in the wind has been ( widely ) discussed in the literature",
    ". the latest @xmath0 yields in this mass interval are those provided by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that , for homogeneity reason , only the non rotating models are shown .",
    "figure [ conf1al26 ] shows that the differences among these theoretical yields are confined within a factor of two .",
    "@xmath1 is an unstable nucleus ( its terrestrial half life is @xmath110 ) that lies slightly out of the stability valley , its closest stable neighbor being @xmath111 .",
    "it is mainly produced by neutron capture on the unstable nucleus @xmath112 and destroyed by the @xmath86 process . since",
    "its closest parent , @xmath112 , is unstable , the @xmath112@xmath86 process must compete with the @xmath112@xmath113 decay to produce an appreciable amount of @xmath1 .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the neutron densities needed to cross the @xmath112 bottleneck may be derived by equating the ( n,@xmath3 ) and @xmath21 decay rates : a value of the order of @xmath114 is obtained at temperatures lower than log(t)=8.7 . above this temperature the half life of @xmath112 ( whose terrestrial value is @xmath115 d ) reduces systematically , dropping to @xmath116 d at log(t)=9.0 and to @xmath117 hour at log(t)=9.6 , while the @xmath112@xmath118 cross section varies very mildly with the temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "the neutron density needed to cross the @xmath112 bottleneck steeply increases with the temperature : it raises to @xmath119 at log(t)=9 and to @xmath120 at log(t)=9.3 .",
    "also the half life of @xmath1 has a steep dependence on the temperature : it remains of the order of the terrestrial value up to log(t)=8.6 and then drops to half a year at log(t)=9 , to @xmath121 d at log(t)=9.2 and to @xmath122 m at log(t)=9.4 . in spite of this strong dependence of its half life on the temperature , and contrarily to what happens to @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath1 is mainly destroyed by the ( n,@xmath3 ) reaction because the @xmath1(n,@xmath3 ) rate always overcomes the decay rate at the extremely high neutron densities required to produce it .",
    "a temperature of the order of 2 billion degrees represents an upper temperature limit for the synthesis of @xmath1 because above this temperature the @xmath123 and the @xmath124 photodisintegrations of both @xmath1 and @xmath112 become tremendously efficient .",
    "such an occurrence limits a possible @xmath1 production to the he , c and ne burning phases .    in he burning , where the main neutron donor is the @xmath71(@xmath74,n)@xmath50 process , a temperature of the order of @xmath125 k would be required to reach the threshold neutron density of @xmath114 . in central he burning",
    "the temperature remains well below @xmath126 k so that the neutron density never exceeds @xmath127 and no appreciable production of @xmath1 occurs . in shell he burning ,",
    "vice versa , the temperature may raise up to and above @xmath125 k so that even a large amount of @xmath1 may be synthesized . to understand its synthesis in this phase it is necessary to briefly remind a few firmly established characteristics of the shell he burning . at variance with the central h burning , where the mass size of the convective core shrinks together with the h content , central he burning is characterized by a convective core that advances progressively in mass ( or remains stable at most ) as the he is depleted . as a consequence , the he profile left by",
    "the central he burning shows a sharp discontinuity in correspondence to the location of the maximum size of the convective core and the he convective shell forms outside this discontinuity in a region where the he abundance is flat and equal to the one left by the h burning ; since all the advanced burning phases are very rapid with respect to the shell he burning timescale , only a modest amount of he is burnt in the shell before the core collapse so that its final abundance barely drops below 0.9 by mass fraction .",
    "the temperature at the base of this convective shell never raises enough to make the @xmath112@xmath86 process competitive with respect to the @xmath112@xmath113 decay so that no @xmath1 is synthesized by these stars .",
    "such a feature holds up to the first mass that becomes a wr star of the wne / wco kind ( 40@xmath2 ) .",
    "in fact , these stars experience such a strong mass loss that they firstly lose all their h rich envelope and then they continue eroding the he core up to the moment of the core collapse . since the properties of the he burning depend on the he core mass size , the core `` feels '' a progressively smaller mass as the he core reduces and hence the mass size of the convective core reduces accordingly : a he profile is left in these stars at the central he exhaustion and its shape will depend on the balance between the speed of the central burning and the mass loss rate .",
    "the he convective shell forms , in these stars , within the region of variable he abundance and hence the well known problem arises if the schwarzschild criterion or the ledoux one must be used to determine if ( and on which timescale ) a convective region forms .",
    "we do not want to address such a question here , mainly because a full non local treatment of the mixing is still missing and only semi phenomenological ( and parametric ) solutions have been proposed over the years to treat these layers .",
    "we decided , vice versa , to explore the two limiting cases : the first one in which the schwarzschild criterion is adopted and a second one in which the ledoux criterion is used .",
    "columns 8 and 9 in table [ tabb ] show the amount of @xmath1 that is produced in the two limiting cases : it is evident that the presence of a fully convective region largely increases the amount of @xmath1 synthesized by the shell he burning .",
    "typical neutron densities reached in the he shell in these very massive stars range between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "a rather modest , but worth being mentioned , additional amount of @xmath1 is also produced in the radiative tail of the he burning shell of the less massive stars .",
    "these stars experience a significant contraction of the core ( including the radiative tail of the he shell ) after the end of the central oxygen burning phase that raises the temperature ( and hence the neutron density ) enough to allow the synthesis of some @xmath1 ( column 7 in table [ tabb ] ) . as the initial mass increases",
    ", this phenomenon disappears because the region external to the co core becomes progressively more insensitive to the evolution of the deep interior of the star ( mainly because of the presence of a very active and stable c convective shell ) .",
    "the contribution of the he convective shell to the synthesis of @xmath1 is shown in figure [ fe60 ] as green filled rhombs when the schwarzschild criterion is adopted and as green empty rhombs when the ledoux criterion is adopted .",
    "c burning behaves similarly to the he burning . in central c burning the neutron density",
    "does not exceed a few times @xmath130 , so that also in this case no @xmath1 may be produced .",
    "the main neutron donor is , once again , the @xmath71(@xmath74,n)@xmath50 process and the reason why it ca nt provide a high neutron rate is , in this case , the relatively low concentration of @xmath74 particles provided by the @xmath72(@xmath72,@xmath74)@xmath81 reaction . in analogy with the he burning , the larger burning temperature ( @xmath131 ) at which the shell c burning occurs , allows a much larger production of @xmath74 particles that translates into a much higher neutron density and hence in a conspicuous @xmath1 production . the typical neutron density we find ranges between @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the mass range 20 to 120 @xmath2while it drops significantly at lower masses .",
    "the mild dependence of the neutron density at the base of the c - convective shell on the initial mass ( for m@xmath13417@xmath2 ) explains why the @xmath1 produced by the c convective shell ( blue filled triangles in figure [ fe60 ] and col .",
    "10 in table [ tabb ] ) increases only modestly with the initial mass .",
    "it must be noted , at this point , that the presence of a convective shell plays a crucial role also for the synthesis of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact it has the double responsibility of bringing new fuel ( @xmath74 particles and @xmath71 ) in the region where the active burning occurs and simultaneously of bringing the freshly made @xmath1 outward in mass , i.e. at lower temperatures where the neutron density becomes negligible and its half life increases substantially .",
    "the 30@xmath2model is the best example of the importance of the convective burning : in fact , the minimum in the yield of the @xmath1 produced by the c shell ( see figure [ fe60 ] ) corresponding to the 30@xmath2model is the direct consequence of the lack of an efficient c convective shell lasting all along the advanced evolutionary phases ( see the previous section ) .",
    "ne burning would produce @xmath1 too , because of the large abundance of the @xmath74 particles and neutrons provided in this case by the @xmath73(@xmath74,n)@xmath0 reaction , but the lack of an extended and stable convective shell lasting up to the moment of the explosion prevents the build up of a significant amount of @xmath1 . in fact , the @xmath1 produced by the advancing ne burning shell drops quickly to zero together with the local ne abundance because either the production channel dries up and the @xmath135 decay speeds up consistently . by the way , the ne convective shell that forms in the 14 and 15@xmath2after the end of the central si burning , and that is responsible of the strong peak in the @xmath0 yield produced by these masses ( see figure [ al26 ] ) , does not lead to a similar effect for the @xmath1 because the neutron density remains too low to cross the @xmath112 bottleneck .",
    "the last episode of synthesis of @xmath1 occurs when the blast wave crosses the mantle of the star on its way out , in the region where the peak temperature is of the order of @xmath136 k and hence roughly in the same region where the ( explosive ) synthesis of @xmath0 occurs . in most cases",
    "such a temperature is reached either at the base or within the c convective shell so that the amount of explosive @xmath1 produced will depend on the local abundances of @xmath81 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath71 left by the last c convective shell episode and on the final mr relation at the moment of the core collapse .",
    "the red filled squares in figure [ fe60 ] and col .",
    "11 in table [ tabb ] show the contribution of the explosive burning to the synthesis of @xmath1 as a function of the initial mass .",
    "two local minima corresponding to the two inversions in the mr relation are quite evident also in this case ( see the previous section ) . in the mass interval 11 to 15@xmath2 , the explosive contribution to the synthesis of @xmath1 is almost negligible because of the low concentration of the nuclei that are necessary for its synthesis .",
    "the 13@xmath2constitutes , however , a striking exception because a large amount of @xmath1 is synthesized by the blast wave in this case .",
    "the reason is that the peak temperature of @xmath136 k occurs beyond the outer border of the c convective shell where the abundances of @xmath72 and @xmath71 , in particular , are much higher than in the c convective shell .",
    "since such a phenomenon occurs for just a single mass , one could question its reality .",
    "a close look at the models shows that , while the radius at which the blast wave synthesizes @xmath1 in these low mass stars remains roughly constant ( @xmath137@xmath138 ) , the radius of the outer border of the last c convective shell at the moment of the core collapse shows a non monotonic trend with the initial mass and , in particular , a minimum value of 0.012@xmath138for the 13@xmath2occurs .",
    "such a minimum corresponds to a local minimum in the mass size of the last c convective shell as well .",
    "it is not easy to understand why the last c convective shell has a minimum mass size for this mass because the temporal evolution and mass ( and radial ) extension of the various convective episodes that follow each other depend on a non linear interplay among various factors ( the main ones being the mass sizes of both the he and the co core and the amount of c left by the central he burning ) . to better assess the range of masses for which this peculiar explosive production occurs",
    ", the computation of a finer mass grid would be required : at present we can just say that it is confined somewhere between 12 and 14@xmath2 .",
    "let us eventually note that no @xmath1 is lost by the stellar wind because , in the present computations , no fraction of the he convective shell is lost through the wind during the advanced wr phase .",
    "the black filled dots in figure [ fe60 ] and col . 6 in table [ tabb ]",
    "show the total yield of @xmath1 as a function of the initial mass in the case in which the schwarzschild criterion is assumed in the he convective shell .",
    "its trend obviously reflects the trends of the main contributors at the various masses .",
    "there is a global direct scaling with the initial mass and a quite monotonic behavior : the two exceptions are the 13@xmath2and the 30@xmath2 . below the 40@xmath2the total yield",
    "is dominated by the contribution of the c convective shell while above this mass it is the he convective shell to play the major role .",
    "the explosive burning almost always plays a minor role .",
    "the black open dots refer to the case in which the ledoux criterion is assumed in the he convective shell : its contribution to the global synthesis of @xmath1 is strongly reduced in this case .    similarly to the @xmath0 case ,",
    "the treatment of the convective layers and the cross section of the @xmath72(@xmath74,@xmath3)@xmath93 are strong sources of uncertainty in the prediction of the @xmath1 yield ( see the previous section ) .",
    "the situation is even worse in this case because the cross sections of all the key processes involved in the synthesis of @xmath1 are purely theoretical : no experimental data exist for the @xmath112(n,@xmath3 ) and the @xmath1(n,@xmath3 ) rates as well as the dependence of their @xmath135 decay on the temperature .",
    "let us eventually note that , since @xmath1 is mainly synthesized by the c and he shells , it may well be considered a pure secondary element because both the target ( fe ) and the bullet ( neutrons ) depend on the initial metallicity ( the neutrons , in fact , mainly come from the @xmath71(@xmath74,n ) process ) .",
    "therefore also the rate of this process as well as the adopted initial [ cno / fe ] ratio ( scaled solar or not ) will significantly influence the final @xmath1 outcome .",
    "@xmath1 yields have been published , as far as we know , by @xcite , ( they are part of the ww95 large database ) and by @xcite and are shown in figure [ conf1fe60 ] as red filled squares and black filled triangles , respectively . our yields obtained for the two extreme cases are shown as filled and open blue dots . for sake of completeness also",
    "the yields obtained by adopting the @xcite mass loss rate are shown ( see next section ) .",
    "the first thing worth noting is that our yields are the only ones available above 40@xmath2 .",
    "second , a good overall agreement exists between the ww95 and our yields : both sets show a peak towards the lower end ( 13@xmath2 in both cases ) and a minimum ( 20@xmath2 in ww95 and 30@xmath2 in our models ) that clearly indicate how the two sets of models behave similarly ( at least qualitatively ) . as for @xcite , their yields are systematically and significantly larger than both the ww95 and our yields .",
    "we do not have an definite explanation for such a difference since our models , computed with the latest input physics available today , show a remarkable agreement with the ww95 ones that have been computed with the input physics available at that time and not with the @xcite one that has probably been computed with a much closer input physics .",
    "let us eventually remark that our @xmath1 yields already published in 2003 and 2004 @xcite are in very close agreement with the present ones .",
    "in the previous sections we have discussed at some extent the yields of both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of the initial mass as well as their dependence on some nuclear processes and some physical phenomena ( like the efficiency of the convective mixing ) . in this section we show how the yields of these two nuclei depend on the mass loss rate beyond the wnl phase .",
    "as it is well known , mass loss is still one of the main uncertain physical phenomenon that influence the evolution of a star . to explore the influence of the mass loss in the wne+wco phases we have recomputed the evolution of the stellar models that enter the wne ( i.e. stars in the range 40 to 120@xmath2 ) by adopting the mass loss rate proposed by @xcite and widely adopted in the past .",
    "this older mass loss rate is much stronger than the @xcite one and it scales as @xmath139 , so that all the very massive models tend now to converge towards a similar quite small final mass ( column 2 in table [ langer ] ) .",
    "moreover , since such a strong reduction of the total mass occurs during the central he burning , all these models tend to have a quite similar co core mass ( column 3 in table [ langer ] ) and hence quite similar advanced burning phases .",
    "this is the reason why the @xmath0 and @xmath1 produced by the advanced burnings ( hydrostatic plus explosive ) tend to become quite insensitive to the initial mass ( columns 5 and 7 in table [ langer ] ) .",
    "of course the @xmath0 lost by the wind ( column 4 in table [ langer ] ) preserves , vice versa , a strong dependence on the initial mass because it is ejected in the earliest phases of the evolution of these stars . note",
    "that the @xmath0 ejected by the wind is slightly larger in the langer case because a larger fraction of the he core is ejected before being reached by the he burning .",
    "the total amount of @xmath0 obtained by adopting the @xcite mass loss rate ( column 4 in table [ langer ] ) is compared to the one obtained by adopting the @xcite mass loss rate in figure [ alfelanger ] ( left axis ) .",
    "a similar comparison for the @xmath1 is shown in the same figure ( right axis ) .",
    "it is clear from these comparisons that while the @xmath0 yield is reduced by roughly a factor of two , the @xmath1 one shows a dramatic dependence on the adopted mass loss rate .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath1 yield is dominated , in these very massive stellar models , by the he convective shell contribution ( see the previous section ) and the very strong mass loss implied by the langer prescription completely kills such a contribution because it reduces enormously the final co core mass .",
    "hence , also the stability criterion adopted in the he convective shell does not play any significant role in this case .",
    "the clumpy and patchy distribution of the @xmath0 in the galactic plane shown by comptel , coupled to the strong correlation between its all - sky map and the 53 ghz free - free emission map , point towards a massive star parent for the @xmath0 and , more specifically , towards the subset of massive stars that are also responsible for the lyman continuum photons that power the ionization of the interstellar medium . by comparing the 53 ghz free - free emission to the @xmath0 decay map ,",
    "@xcite determined also that the scaling factor between the 1.8 mev gamma ray line ( @xmath4 ) flux and the lyman continuum photons ( lcp ) flux remains roughly constant all over the galactic plane .",
    "he quantified this occurrence by identifying the average amount of @xmath0 ( @xmath140@xmath2 ) that must be associated to the lcp flux ( @xmath141 ) of an equivalent o7 v star ( @xmath142 ) in order to obtain the observed correlation between the two aforementioned all - sky maps ; see @xcite for details . for reasons of convenience",
    "we prefer to reinterpret these data in terms of number of @xmath4 photons per ionizing photon ( gpl ) ; this number , that we name for convenience @xmath143 , results to be equal to @xmath7 gpl .",
    "let us remind once again that the determination of @xmath143 does not require any explicit assumption about the sources of the ionizing photons and of the @xmath0 but only that the @xmath0 nuclei and the lcp share the same spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "we have discussed in the previous sections essentially three sets of models that differ because of the mass loss rate adopted in the wne+wco phases and because of the stability criterion adopted in the he convective shell .",
    "for sake of clarity , the set of models computed by adopting the @xcite mass loss rate in the wne+wco phases and the schwarzschild criterion in the he convective shell will be referred to as the nl00 models , the one computed with the same mass loss rate but the ledoux criterion in the he convective shell will be referred to as the nl00l models while the set computed by adopting the @xcite mass loss rate will be referred to as the la89 models .",
    "since all these different choices concern only stars more massive than 35@xmath2 , all these sets share the same stellar models between 11 and 35@xmath2 .    from the theoretical side",
    "we can easily determine the @xmath143 factor(s ) for our grid of models .",
    "let us remind that at the base of this derivation there is the usual assumption of a steady state condition , i.e. of the equivalence between destruction and production rates : this implies that the observed decay rate of the @xmath0 is equal to the average ejection rate of this nucleus from the presently evolving stars .",
    "we have estimated the number of lyman continuum photons produced by each of our models by means of table 3 of @xcite ; the two following relations provide both the average @xmath144 and the lifetime of a star as a function of the initial mass ( for our grid of models ) :    @xmath145 @xmath146    note that these relations are obviously identical for the three sets of models .",
    "figure [ gplxm ] shows the trend of both @xmath147 ( red filled dots , left axis ) and the average @xmath0 production rate ( first right axis ) with the initial mass .",
    "the blue filled and open squares refer to the nl00 and the la89 models , respectively . by the way ,",
    "the average @xmath0 production rate is simply the total amount of @xmath0 produced by a star divided by its lifetime .",
    "the @xmath143 factor per each stellar mass is also shown in the same figure and its scale is on the second right axis . the black filled and open rhombs refer , respectively , to the nl00 and la89 cases .",
    "@xmath143 remains roughly constant above 30@xmath2because both @xmath147 and the @xmath0 production rate run almost parallel ; below this mass , on the contrary , the lyman continuum photons drop down faster than the @xmath0 production rate , so that @xmath143 increases significantly .",
    "note that @xmath148 varies by roughly a factor of two between the nl00 and the la89 stellar models .",
    "the data shown in figure [ gplxm ] can not be directly used to interpret the observed galactic value of @xmath143 because stars of different masses contribute simultaneously to both the lcp and the @xmath4 fluxes , and hence a proper initial mass function ( imf ) must be taken into account .",
    "the imf is usually expressed as a power law , namely :    @xmath149    where n(m ) is the number of stars of mass m. the constant k is fixed by the condition :    @xmath150    where @xmath151 and @xmath152 represent the limiting masses that bracket the range of the stars that explode as core collapse supernovae . as for the lowest mass that explodes as a core collapse supernova",
    ", we have adopted the smallest star in our grid , i.e. the 11@xmath2 .",
    "one could question that even less massive stars do explode as core collapse supernovae , but this is practically uninfluent with respect to the computation of the @xmath143 parameter because below 11@xmath2both the lcp and the @xmath0 drop practically to zero .",
    "on the other hand , the choice of the upper limit may play a role .",
    "figure [ gplximf ] shows the theoretical @xmath143 for a range of possible values of the power law slope , x , and three different values of the upper mass limit @xmath152 .",
    "the blue solid , red dotted and green dashed lines refer to three different choices of the upper mass limit : 120 , 60 and 40@xmath2respectively .",
    "the thick and thin lines refer to the nl00 and la89 models respectively .",
    "it is quite evident that , fortunately , @xmath143 does not depend significantly on the adopted mass loss rate and also the dependence on @xmath152 is quite modest ; in fact , even a drastic change of @xmath152 from , e.g. , 120 to 40@xmath2affects @xmath148 by no more than a factor of two .",
    "the reason for such a low dependence of @xmath143 on @xmath152 is that above 30@xmath2the ratio between the @xmath0 production rate and lyman continuum luminosity remains roughly constant ( see figure [ gplxm ] ) for all sets of models .",
    "the horizontal thick solid black line marks the observed galactic value derived by @xcite , but expressed in terms of @xmath148 , while the shaded area reflects the range of values that correspond to an uncertainty of a factor of two in the observed value .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have recently rediscussed the imf slope for massive stars and came to the conclusion that it must be larger than , at least , x=1.8 . if we take this specific value ( marked by the thin vertical black dashed line in figure [ gplximf ] ) as a conservative representation of the actual imf slope of these stars , it turns out that a good fit to the galactic @xmath143 exists for any @xmath152 mass ranging between , at least , 120 and 40@xmath2and both sets of models .",
    "the fit improves for steeper imf slopes .",
    "we therefore conclude that either the nl00 and the la89 sets of models can naturally explain and reproduce the constant galactic @xmath143 .",
    "the good fit to this parameter , however , does not carry any information , by itself , about the total amount of @xmath0 present in our galaxy . in order to determine such an amount by means of @xmath143 ,",
    "it is necessary to know the total lyman continuum luminosity provided by our galaxy ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "once this value is known , the global @xmath0 production rate , @xmath154 , is given by @xmath155 and the present steady state abundance of @xmath0 in our galaxy would be given by @xmath156 .",
    "recent determinations of the galactic lyman continuum luminosity range between @xmath157 @xcite and @xmath158 @xcite with about 50% uncertainty in both cases ( see the cited papers for details ) .",
    "if one would adopt the highest value @xcite , an imf slope x=1.8 and @xmath159@xmath2 , the present steady state abundance of @xmath0 in our galaxy would amount to 1.97@xmath2for the nl00 models and to 1.70@xmath2for the la89 case . figures [ gplximf ] ( right scale ) and [ sfr ] show the trends of the @xmath0 abundance , of the sfr , of the number of type ii supernovae and of the type ibc supernovae as a function of the slope x for a @xmath160 . in figure",
    "[ sfr ] , the thick lines refer to an @xmath161@xmath2 while the thin lines refer to an @xmath162@xmath2 .",
    "since all these relations scale linearly with @xmath153 , the adoption of the value provided by @xcite would simply imply a downward scaling by a factor equal to @xmath163 .",
    "the quantities shown in figure [ sfr ] obviously do not depend at all neither on the adopted mass loss beyond the wnl phase nor on the stability criterion adopted in the he convective shell .",
    "figure [ fracal26 ] shows the total amount of @xmath0 ejected by a stellar generation ( solid lines - right axis ) together with the percentage contributions of the type ii supernovae ( dot dashed lines ) , the type ibc supernovae ( dashed lines ) and the wr stars ( dotted lines ) , all as a function of the imf slope x : the thick and thin lines refer to the nl00 and the la89 cases , respectively .",
    "the observed trends may be readily understood by reminding that a ) the la89 models predict sistematically less @xmath0 than the nl00 ones ( see table [ langer ] ) because of the reduced production both in the c convective shell and ne explosive burnings ( see the previous section ) and b ) the total amount of @xmath0 ejected by the type ii supernovae is identical in both sets because they share the same stellar models below 40@xmath2 .",
    "since the integration over the imf may depend on the adopted upper mass limit ( @xmath152 ) , we show in figures [ al26mtopnl ] ( for the nl00 case ) and [ al26mtopla ] ( for the la89 case ) the same quantities shown in figure [ fracal26 ] as a function of @xmath152 and two specific imf slopes , i.e. x=1.8 and x=2.5 .",
    "both these figures clearly show that , indipendently on @xmath152 and on the mass loss rate adopted beyond the wnl stage , the largest contribution to the total @xmath0 produced by a stellar generation comes from the type ii supernovae , while both the wr and the type ibc contribute at most ( complessively ) for a 30% in the most favoreable case . the present result , i.e. that most of the @xmath0 comes from the type ii supernovae must be interpreted as a property of our sets of models .",
    "we have already shown in figure [ conf1al26 ] that the yields produced by different authors differ even significantly in the mass range they share ; it is therefore very probable that they could have been different also in the mass interval not explored by other groups so that even the relative contributions of the various mass intervals could change significantly from one author to another . in other words , it would be a mistake to use a set of models that extend only up to 30- 40@xmath2to infer the @xmath0 produced by a generation of massive stars basing such a choice on the properties of the present models .",
    "it is not known a priori the role that would play the more massive stars within other sets of models . in this respect",
    "it is of overwhelming importance that also other groups compute grid of models extended in mass at least as much as in the present ones , because only a comparison between indipendent computations would allow a better understanding of the role really played by the various mass intervals to the global budget of the @xmath0 .",
    "it goes without saying that the same holds for the @xmath1 .",
    "both rhessi and spi ( integral ) have reported a measurement of the @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio towards the central radiant of our galaxy ( see the introduction ) .",
    "the latest values , at the time of writing , are @xmath8 ( rhessi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath9 ( spi , * ? ? ?",
    "since the two experimental data show a compatibility range around @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0=0.14 , we decided to tentatively ( and arbitrarily ) adopt this value as representative of both the experiments and to consider as a typical error the semi difference between the quoted values .",
    "this representative value is shown as a horizontal black thick line in figure [ fealsux ] , while the two experimental values are shown as thin black solid lines in the same figure .",
    "figure [ fealsux ] also shows our theoretical predictions for the three sets of models , namely the nl00 ( red solid line ) , the nl00l ( blue dashed line ) and the la89 ( green dotted line ) and @xmath152=120@xmath2 .",
    "this figure shows that the nl00 models predict a too large @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio for any slope in the explored range .",
    "such a large flux ratio is due to the very large amount of @xmath1 produced in the he convective shell in stars more massive than 35@xmath2 .",
    "the adoption of the ledoux criterion in the he convective shell significantly dumps out the @xmath1 production in this region so that the theoretical flux ratio reduces somewhat though it remains larger than the observed value .",
    "the fit improves as the imf slope increases because the contribution of the more massive stars reduces correspondingly .",
    "the la89 models , vice versa , predict an @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio in excellent agreement with the observed value over a very large range of imf slopes , and this is the consequence of the very strong mass loss that prevents either the production of @xmath1 in the he convective shell and reduces also its production in the c convective shell and in the ne explosive burning .",
    "figure [ fealsumtop ] shows , for two selected imf slopes , the dependence of this flux ratio on @xmath152 . only the nl00 models show a strong dependence of the flux ratio on @xmath152 and this is due to the fact that this is the only set for which a substantial contribution to the @xmath1 comes from the stars more massive than 40@xmath2 .",
    "a paper devoted to the presentation of a new generation of @xmath0 yields can not escape the temptation to reanalyze the fit to @xmath10 velorum , the closest wr star ( wr11 ) presently known .",
    "as far as we know , the latest very detailed and comprehensive analysis of this wr star has been presented by @xcite and we refer the reader to this paper and to the references therein for a detailed discussion of both the observational aspects and the theoretical problems involved in the interpretation of this star ( either in the single and binary stars scenarios ) . here",
    "it suffices to say that the typical initial mass quoted for this star is @xmath164@xmath2 , that its initial metallicity was very probably solar and the binary system is wide enough that probably the evolution of @xmath10 velorum was not affected much by the binarity environment .",
    "no @xmath0 has been detected around this star but an upper limit of @xmath165@xmath2has been derived by @xcite .",
    "this value represents a problem because the theoretical models predict a much larger amount of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite find that a 60@xmath2solar metallicity star ejects @xmath166@xmath2of @xmath0 through the wind while @xcite quote a value of @xmath167@xmath2for the same initial mass ; also the older models by @xcite predict an amount of @xmath0 equal to @xmath168@xmath2for a 50@xmath2star . also for a mass as low as 40@xmath2the models predict rather large values that are only barely compatible with the quoted upper limit : @xmath169@xmath2@xcite and @xmath170@xmath2@xcite .",
    "such a failure in reproducing the closest wr star is very embarrassing because this is a member of the class of stars that are very probably responsible for the production of the bulk of the @xmath0 presently in the disk of our galaxy .",
    "an inspection to table [ tabb ] shows that the wind component of the @xmath0 yield in our models is roughly a factor of two lower than that obtained by the other authors , so that a large part of the discrepancy is removed .",
    "in addition to this , there is another important point that has been neglected up to now : the timescale over which the @xmath0 is injected into the interstellar medium .",
    "figure [ al26vt ] shows the cumulative abundance of @xmath0 present in the ejecta as a function of the age of the star and the four panels refer to the 40 , 60 , 80 and 120@xmath2 : the blue dashed thick lines show the case in which the @xmath0 is assumed to accumulate in the interstellar medium without decaying ( unrealistic , but usually adopted , ideal case in which the @xmath0 is assumed to start decaying after it has been completely ejected ) while the red solid thick lines represent the real total amount of @xmath0 one would find in the interstellar medium as a function of time ( taking into account the fact that the @xmath0 starts to decay as soon as it is ejected in the interstellar medium ) .",
    "the gray area mark the temporal phase in which each star appears as a wco star .",
    "if @xmath10 velorum is now just at the beginning of its wco phase ( the worst case because the _ real _ @xmath0 abundance is at its maximum ) the predicted amount of @xmath0 would be 15 to 20% smaller than the value shown in table [ tabb ] for masses in the range 40 to 120@xmath2 .",
    "in particular , an abundance of @xmath171@xmath2is predicted in the interstellar medium in the case of a 60@xmath2model , a value well below the upper limit quoted at present .",
    "this means that at least the full range of masses between 40@xmath2and 60@xmath2is now compatible with the observed upper limit .",
    "there is even room for an initial mass larger than 60@xmath2 . we ca nt be more precise at the moment because our nearest grid mass is the 80@xmath2 .",
    "the adoption of the la89 models would not change these results appreciably .",
    "hence we conclude that a proper treatment of the injection of the @xmath0 ejected into the interstellar medium coupled to our new yields removes the longstanding discrepancy between the upper limit quoted for @xmath10 velorum and the theoretical predictions .",
    "we have extensively discussed the production sites of the two gamma ray emitters @xmath0 and @xmath1 over the range of massive stars that may contribute significantly to either the production of these nuclei and to the lyman continuum luminosity , i.e. the range 11 to 120@xmath2 .",
    "these theoretical predictions fully cover all the evolutionary phases from the pre main sequence to the explosive burnings . at variance with current ideas , @xmath0 is mainly produced by the ne / c explosive burning over most of the mass interval analyzed .",
    "the main production site of the @xmath1 , vice versa , strongly depends on the adopted mass loss rate . in the la89 case",
    "the main @xmath1 producer is always the c convective shell while in the nl00 case the main producer is still the c convective shell for masses lower than 40@xmath2while above this mass a strong contribution comes from the he convective shell . since the he convective shell forms , in these stars , in a region where a gradient in the he abundance is present , its contribution to the synthesys of @xmath1 depends significantly on the adopted stability criterion ( schwarzschild or ledoux ) .",
    "we have used these yields to address the problem of the diffuse abundances of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the galaxy .",
    "the discovery of an almost constant flux ratio all over the galactic disk between the lyman continuum photons ( derived from the 53 ghz free - free emission all - sky map ) and the @xmath4 mev line ( that we express as @xmath143 , number of @xmath4 mev photons per lyman continuum photon -gpl ) , plus the recently determined @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio towards the inner radiant of the galaxy , constitute in our opinion the two key experimental data a set of models must satisfy .",
    "the reason is that , once they are assumed to be equally spatially distributed , their ratio is independent on their spatial distribution .",
    "in addition to that , also the highly uncertain sfr fortunately does not play any role in these ratios ( once a steady state is assumed ) .",
    "the experimental value of the @xmath143 parameter has been determined by @xcite ( even if in different units ) to be @xmath172 while the value of the @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio ( averaged between the rhessi and spi values ) is of the order of @xmath173 . as for",
    "the first ratio , @xmath143 , its constancy along the galactic longitude could hide additional information .",
    "different longitudes probably map combinations of different stellar populations ( the smallest longitudes probably mapping the region with the highest average metallicity ) : hence the constancy of @xmath143 could imply a low dependence of this ratio on the initial metallicity",
    ". the same argument does not hold for the @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio because in this case we just have one integrated measure towards the central radiant of the galaxy .",
    "we have shown that the observed @xmath143 may be reproduced fairly well for a variety of slopes of the imf and both sets of models , namely the nl00 and the la89 ones . if we focus on a specific slope , e.g. x=1.8 ( a value widely accepted to be reasonable for these massive stars ) a maximum discrepancy of 0.2 dex",
    "is obtained , independently on the adopted @xmath174 and mass loss rate beyond the wnl phase .",
    "the fit even improves for steeper slopes . within our sets of models",
    ", @xmath0 is mainly produced by stars less massive than , say , 35@xmath2 , the total contribution of the more massive stars ( through the wind of the wr stars plus the type ibc supernovae ) never exceeding 30% of the total .",
    "also this result depends only moderately on the adopted mass loss rate beyond the wnl phase and on @xmath174 .",
    "the theoretical @xmath1 yield , on the contrary , strongly depends on the mass loss rate adopted in the wne+wco phases mainly because mass loss controls the amount of @xmath1 produced in the he convective shell of the stars more massive than 35@xmath2 during the very latest phases that precede their final collapse .",
    "depending on the adopted mass loss rate , the predicted @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio may range between 0.12 and 0.25 for a slope x=1.8 .",
    "the models that better reproduce the observed ratio ( @xmath175 ) are the la89 ones since the very strong mass loss rate proposed by @xcite completely dumps out the contribution of the he convective shell and also reduces the contribution of the c convective shell because of the much smaller co core mass . the dependence of the @xmath1@xmath6@xmath0 flux ratio on both the imf slope and @xmath174 is negligible in this case because of the overall modest contribution of the stars more massive than 35@xmath2to the global budget of the @xmath1 .",
    "the worst fit is obtained for the nl00 models since in this case either a strong contribution to the total yield comes from the he convective shell and also the contribution from the c convective shell is larger because the mass size of the co core is definitely much large in this case . a steep imf plus an @xmath174 not larger than , say ,",
    "60@xmath2could anyway reconcile also this set of models with the observed flux ratio .",
    "of course many other unceretainties affect both yields and we have shown in this paper how the @xmath0 yield depends , e.g. , on several cross sections , initial abundances and size of the h - convective core .",
    "also a distortion of the imf towards the highest masses could lead , in practice , to a steepening of the slope .",
    "it must also be noted that all the present results have been obtained with solar metallicity stars while very probably at least the inner galaxy has an average metallicity larger than solar .",
    "we actually do not know how the metallicity influences the yields of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 and hence we leave such an exploration to another paper .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 wind component on the initial metallicity has been already discussed in a number of papers @xcite but unfortunately such a dependence is not representative of the global trend because we have shown in this paper that the @xmath0 present in the wind always represents a modest contribution to the total budget of the @xmath0 .",
    "the determination of the total amount of @xmath0 present in the galaxy requires the knowledge of an additional quite uncertain parameter , i.e. the sfr .",
    "such a quantity is usually determined by means of either the number of core collapse supernovae per unit time or the total lyman continuum luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "since it would be desirable to have a sfr linked as strongly as possible to the stars that mainly contribute to the lyman continuum luminosity as well as to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 synthesys , the adoption of the total lyman continuum luminosity should be preferred .",
    "the core collapse supernovae , in fact , are dominated ( in number ) by the type ii supernovae whose range extends down to masses that do not contribute significantly to neither the lyman continuum luminosity nor the @xmath0 nor the @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the mass range 11 to 13@xmath2produces roughly 30% of the total number of type ii supernovae while their contribution to the synthesis of the @xmath0 is of the order of 6% ; the situation would even worsen if the lower mass limit of the massive stars would reduce to 10 or even 9@xmath2because these stars would strongly affect the frequency of the type ii supernovae without contributing significantly neither to the lyman continuum luminosity nor to the @xmath0 or to the @xmath1 budgets . by normalizing to the total lyman continuum luminosity estimated by @xcite and an imf slope x=1.8 , we predict roughly 2@xmath2of @xmath0 presently in the galaxy in the nl00 case .",
    "the adoption of the la89 models would reduce such an amount to 1.7@xmath2 .",
    "we have also fitted @xmath10 velorum , the closest wr star . in particular",
    "we predict an abundance of @xmath171@xmath2of @xmath0 ( for a 60@xmath2 ) , value compatible with the current upper limit of @xmath165@xmath2 .",
    "we did not address the fit to specific ob associations in this paper because it would require an evolutionary synthetic code , as it has been correctly addressed by , e.g. , @xcite , that is not available at present .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank roland diehl and nikos prantzos for many helpful discussions .",
