    "recent discoveries of unconventional electronic properties in multinary materials with complex crystal structures , such as quasicrystals and high @xmath2 superconductors , have stimulated a growing demand for realistic theoretical studies of these systems .",
    "a full understanding of the interrelationships between composition , structure , and electronic properties of these complex systems requires a detailed analysis of individual materials at the microscopic level .",
    "while the quantum mechanical modeling of solids through first principles calculations has served as a very useful tool to obtain the microscopic information needed for structurally and chemically simple solids , there are practical problems associated with complex systems , especially with nonperiodic structures like quasicrystals .",
    "the challenge , therefore , is to identify simpler systems which can be fully studied with this theoretical tool , and yet shed light on issues that are relevant to the physics of more complex systems .",
    "one issue that arises in the study of complex intermetallic systems is the formation of a ( pseudo)gap in the electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level and the relation of this feature to the stability of the particular structure . for quasicrystals ,",
    "the presence of an ( almost ) universal suppression in the electronic dos at the fermi level has long been established both experimentally@xcite and from first principles band - structure calculations for rational approximants.@xcite it is widely believed that this particular feature of quasicrystals is related to their stability@xcite based on an analogy to the hume rothery rule@xcite for the stability of metallic alloys .",
    "the role of a pseudogap in structural stability has also been suggested by the experimental observation of very high resistivities in structurally well ordered stable quasicrystals.@xcite motivated by these observations , there has been recent interest in understanding the structural energetics , stability and transport properties of intermetallic compounds with small unit cells exhibiting a ( pseudo)gap in their electronic spectrum .",
    "however , relatively few examples of such systems are known .",
    "csau is an extensively studied example@xcite with a band gap of 2.6 ev .",
    "the electronic structure and transport properties of al@xmath0ru have recently been of considerable interest due to its structural simplicity and compositional similarity to quasicrystals.@xcite another interesting class of intermetallic compounds with a pseudogap at the fermi level is the skutterudite pnictides ma@xmath3 ( m = co , rh or ir , and a = p , as or sb ) .",
    "these compounds exhibit unusual transport properties making them likely candidates for advanced thermoelectric materials.@xcite the identification of additional examples of intermetallic compounds with ( pseudo)gaps is therefore a problem of both fundamental and technological interest .",
    "a few years ago , the ternary intermetallic compounds nisnm ( m = ti , zr , hf ) were reported to exhibit unusual transport and optical properties suggesting that they may have a gap at the fermi level.@xcite this observation establishes a possible new class of semiconducting intermetallics , which we have identified as good subjects for the theoretical study of band gap formation in intermetallics and its relation to structural stability.@xcite these compounds crystallize in the mgagas structure and are related to the metallic heusler compounds ni@xmath0snm by the removal of an fcc ni sublattice.@xcite this simple crystal structure makes them quite suitable for a first principles approach@xcite to the microscopic understanding of their unusual optical and electronic properties . while a complete understanding of these properties would require incorporating the effects of a high concentration of defects , calculations for the ideal structures should provide a useful starting point for further analysis . to understand the origin of the semiconducting gap in this system , one needs more than `` simple '' arguments . from a tight - binding analysis of the first principles bands and charge densities , both the @xmath4 hybridization on the snm rocksalt substructure and the symmetry breaking due to the ni sublattice",
    "are found to be crucial factors in gapping the electronic spectrum .",
    "examination of total energies of ternary compounds and hypothetical binary substructures , calculated from first principles , allows us to conclude that the formation of the gap is not directly associated with structural stability in this system .",
    "finally , the use of first principles information also assists us in identifying chemical trends for the prediction of related semiconducting intermetallics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the technical details of the _ ab initio _ pseudopotential calculations for the nisnm and ni@xmath0snm compounds . in section iii ,",
    "we first examine their ground state structural properties and identify the correct atomic arrangement for the nisnm compounds .",
    "this is followed by the results of band - structure and dos calculations which characterize , within the local density approximation ( lda ) , the ni@xmath0snm compounds as normal metals , and the nisnm compounds as narrow gap semiconductors with indirect gaps near 0.5 ev . in section iv , we discuss these results in a tight - binding framework and by considering decompositions of the ternary structures into binary substructures plus a third element sublattice .",
    "particular attention is given to the origin of the gap and structural stability of nisnzr .",
    "we compare our results with available experimental measurements and , using the lessons from our analysis , we predict a new semiconducting intermetallic compound . finally , our results are summarized in section v.",
    "for the calculation of band structures and total energies , we used the _ ab initio _ pseudopotential method with a plane wave basis set and the conjugate gradients algorithm.@xcite the general technical issues that arise in the application of this method to intermetallic systems containing transition metals have been discussed in detail in ref . .",
    "in this study , for sn , zr and hf , we used the scalar - relativistic pseudopotentials of bachelet , hamann , and schlter@xcite ( bhs ) . for ti and ni",
    ", we constructed hamann , schlter , and chiang ( hsc ) pseudopotentials@xcite for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals , and optimized pseudopotentials@xcite ( opt ) for the @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential used in these calculations is the functional of ceperley and alder as parametrized by perdew and zunger.@xcite complete information concerning pseudopotential constuction is given in table i. these pseudopotentials were put into separable form using single or double projectors for each angular momentum ( table i ) with the @xmath8 component as the local potential.@xcite in all cases , the absence of ghost states and the transferability of pseudopotentials were checked by applying the ghost theorem of gonze _",
    "et al._@xcite and comparing the logarithmic derivatives for these nonlocal pseudopotentials with their all - electron values over a wide energy range .",
    "all total energy and band - structure calculations were done on ibm rs/6000 workstations using the conjugate gradients program castep 2.1,@xcite slightly modified for metallic systems . the plane wave cutoff used in the calculations was determined by requiring the kinetic energy in the fourier components of all atomic pseudo wave functions to be less than 1 mry .",
    "this cutoff was set by the sharply peaked 3@xmath7 valence states of ni to be 52 ry , allowing us to perform accurate calculations with 2200 - 2800 plane waves depending on the size of the unit cell . due to the metallic nature of some of the compounds investigated in this work",
    ", we used a fermi - dirac broadening @xcite of 50 mev for * k*-point sampling with monkhorst - pack@xcite grids of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , resulting in 10 and 19 * k * points in the irreducible brillouin zone ( bz ) , respectively .",
    "lattice constants and bulk moduli were obtained by fitting to the birch form , as described in ref . .",
    "the band - structure calculations for the nisnm and ni@xmath0snm compounds were performed with self - consistent charge densities computed with a monkhorst - pack grid of @xmath11 . for dos calculations , we first used this charge density to evaluate the band structure on a monkhorst - pack grid of @xmath12 ( 110 * k * points in the irreducible bz ) , and interpolated the eigenvalues to a grid of @xmath13 225  000 * k * points in the irreducible fcc bz using the interpolation scheme of monkhorst and pack@xcite based on a global bz fit .",
    "we then applied the gilat - raubenheimer method@xcite to this fine mesh in the irreducible bz . to check the accuracy of this interpolation ,",
    "the calculated band structures along certain high symmetry lines were compared with the interpolated values , and the agreement was found to be very good within a few percent .",
    "finally , for the band - structure plots and for use in the tight - binding analysis , symmetry labels along high symmetry lines were assigned using projection operators for the corresponding irreducible representations .",
    "the ternary crystal structures included in this study are the bif@xmath3 structure for the ni@xmath0snm compounds and the mgagas structure for the nisnm compounds.@xcite the crystal structure of ni@xmath0snm ( space group @xmath14m3@xmath15 ) , shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , can be viewed as a rocksalt arrangement of sn and m atoms with ni atoms at the center of each cube of sn - m atoms .",
    "the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure of nisnm ( space group @xmath144@xmath16 ) , shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , can be obtained from that of ni@xmath0snm by eliminating one of the fcc ni sublattices , resulting in tetrahedral coordination of the sn and m atoms by ni .",
    "we also considered two additional distinct type crystal structures obtained by interchanging the ni , sn and m sublattices .",
    "these three different crystal structures can be distinguished by identifying the doubly tetrahedrally coordinated element ; the relevant coordination environments are shown in fig .",
    "we refer to these three structures as the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 phases depending on whether ni , sn , or m is doubly tetrahedrally coordinated , respectively.@xcite    first , we performed total energy calculations at several lattice constants for all six compounds ni@xmath0snm and nisnm ( in the @xmath17 phase ) to determine their ground state structural properties .",
    "the results are summarized in table ii . as seen from this table ,",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice constants are in very good agreement with experiment , with slight underestimates typical of the lda . to our knowledge ,",
    "no measurements of the bulk moduli for these compounds have been reported in the literature ; the values in the table are therefore predictions for the bulk moduli of the ni@xmath0snm and nisnm compounds .",
    "we also performed total energy calculations for the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 phases of nisnm .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the results of these calculations for m = zr , and the @xmath17 phase is seen to be the lowest energy structure ( 2.28 and 2.85 ev / unit cell below the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases , respectively ) , consistent with reported structural determinations . the experimental lattice constant for the nisnzr compound ( 6.11 )@xcite is also closest to the lda lattice constant of the @xmath17 phase .",
    "this calculation therefore unambiguously determines the crystal structure of the nisnm compounds as the @xmath17 phase .",
    "the reasons behind the relative stability of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 phases will be discussed in section iv .",
    "next , we performed band - structure and dos calculations for both ni@xmath0snm and nisnm compounds as a first step towards a microscopic understanding of their electronic structures .",
    "figure 3 shows the calculated band structure along high symmetry lines of the fcc bz for ni@xmath0snzr .",
    "this exhibits normal metallic behavior with bands crossing the fermi level along various directions , which results in a finite dos at the fermi level , as shown in fig .",
    "very similar band structures and dos were also obtained for ni@xmath0snti and ni@xmath0snhf .",
    "on the other hand , band - structure calculations for the lowest energy structure of nisnm ( the @xmath17 phase ) show that the fermi level does not intersect any bands along the high symmetry directions , as can be seen in fig . 5 for the case of nisnzr .",
    "in fact , dos calculations show that for these compounds there is a gap in the electronic dos at the fermi level ( fig .",
    "for all three compounds , this is an indirect @xmath20 gap near 0.5 ev , while the direct gap , close to 1.1 ev , occurs at @xmath21 ( table iii ) . in contrast , band - structure calculations for the higher energy @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases of nisnm show metallic behavior ( fig .",
    "therefore , these lda calculations characterize the nisnm compounds in the @xmath17 phase as narrow gap semiconductors , while ni@xmath0snm compounds and the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases of nisnm are found to be normal metals .",
    "using the results of first principles total energy and band - structure calculations , we can develop a physical understanding of the microscopic mechanisms in the formation of the band gap in the @xmath17 phase of nisnm , and of the differences between these compounds and related systems , specifically the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases and ni@xmath0snm .",
    "in section iv a , we investigate the origin of the band gap in a tight - binding framework . in section",
    "iv b , we consider the three phases of the ternary compounds nisnm using the decompositions into a binary substructure plus a third element sublattice , and show that these decompositions can be quite useful in discussing the stability and electronic structures of ternary compounds .",
    "after a brief discussion of the differences between the metallic heusler compounds ni@xmath0snm and the semiconducting nisnm compounds in section iv c , we examine the available experimental data on the nisnm compounds from the point of view of our theoretical calculations in section iv d. the relationships between band gap formation and structural stability in intermetallic compounds are considered in section iv e , and the applicability of these ideas to the nisnm compounds is examined .",
    "finally , in section iv f , we use the lessons gained from this analysis to predict a new semiconducting intermetallic compound .",
    "we note that for definiteness , the discussion in these sections is for m = zr , though the overall features are the same for m = ti and hf .",
    "our tight - binding analysis begins with identification of the orbital characters of the valence and conduction bands . with a plane - wave basis set ,",
    "this is accomplished by examining contour plots of the charge densities of individual states at various * k * points .",
    "we first consider the bands well below the fermi level . the lowest - lying band in fig .",
    "5 has predominantly sn @xmath5 orbital character , while the narrow bands above it have predominantly ni @xmath7 character .",
    "this seems to suggest a picture in which bands arising from the sn @xmath5 , ni @xmath7 , and either sn @xmath6 or @xmath22 type zr @xmath7 orbitals are fully occupied , forming a closed shell system with a gap to the next excited state .",
    "we therefore examined the triply degenerate @xmath23 and the doubly degenerate @xmath24 states just below the fermi level , shown in fig .",
    "the charge density plots in the ( 110 ) plane show that the @xmath23 states have mainly zr @xmath7 character [ fig .",
    "8(c ) ] , while the @xmath24 states have mainly sn @xmath6 character [ fig .",
    "8(e ) ] . this change in orbital character shows that the gap in nisnm compounds can not be due to a simple closed shell picture , since in that case we would expect the highest occupied band to be derived from either sn @xmath6 or zr @xmath7 orbitals .    a detailed analysis of band behavior is therefore needed to explain the formation of the gap .",
    "we focus on the bands @xmath25 as capturing the essential features of the gap mechanisms .",
    "symmetry labels and orbital characters allow the separation of bands into different subspaces which can be considered one at a time . we start with the highest occupied valence band @xmath26 . the doubly degenerate @xmath26 conduction band from @xmath23 to @xmath24 [ fig .",
    "8(a ) ] has the same symmetry label , but complementary orbital character , changing from mainly sn @xmath6 at @xmath27 [ fig .",
    "8(b ) ] to mainly zr @xmath7 at @xmath21 [ fig .",
    "to describe this pair of bands , we use a tight - binding basis including the sn @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and zr @xmath30 , @xmath31 orbitals.@xcite the behavior of these bands , shown with thick lines in fig .",
    "8(a ) , can be explained as arising from dispersive zr @xmath7 and sn @xmath6 type bands which hybridize along @xmath32 and anticross .",
    "the reason that this does not look like a familiar anticrossing of two bands ( where the bands approach and then slightly repel each other ) is that this @xmath4 hybridization is large and strongly @xmath33-dependent , with the maximum value halfway along @xmath32 . specifically , starting with nonzero interactions only for sn - sn and zr - zr nearest neighbors in the fcc lattice , the dispersion @xmath34 for the sn @xmath28 and @xmath29 orbitals is @xmath35 while the dispersion @xmath36 for the zr @xmath30 and @xmath31 orbitals is @xmath37 where @xmath17 runs from 0 ( at @xmath27 ) to 1 ( at @xmath21 ) . in these equations ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the onsite orbital energies of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals , respectively , and the definitions of the tight - binding parameters are as in ref . .",
    "if the parameters are taken to have the usual approximate relative magnitudes and signs ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44),@xcite the @xmath6 type bands disperse downward with a maximum at @xmath27 , while the @xmath7 type bands disperse upward with a minimum at @xmath27 . with a suitable choice of the parameters , the two bands will cross .",
    "however , including a nearest neighbor sn - zr @xmath4 interaction will result in an anticrossing of these two bands , with a matrix element @xmath45 for this geometry , which is largest halfway along @xmath32 .",
    "this tight - binding parametrization reproduces the first principles dispersion and is consistent with the orbital character of the states obtained from charge density plots .",
    "this shows that the strong @xmath4 hybridization in the snzr rocksalt substructure is a necessary ingredient in the formation of the gap , for if it were zero , the @xmath23 states below ( above ) the fermi level would join with the @xmath24 states above ( below ) the fermi level resulting in a finite dos at the fermi level .",
    "however , this hyridization is not in itself sufficient for the gap formation in the ternary nisnzr compound .    to complete the analysis of gap formation in the @xmath17 phase of nisnzr",
    ", we must consider the conduction band minimum @xmath46 [ fig .",
    "8(a ) ] , which has mainly zr @xmath47 character .",
    "since the valence band maximum @xmath23 also has zr @xmath47 character , an unhybridized zr @xmath47 band , with @xmath48 symmetry , must anticross with @xmath48 bands derived from other orbitals for the gap to form .",
    "however , this anticrossing can not be explained by considering _ only _ the snzr substructure as in the case of @xmath26 bands . due to the @xmath49 symmetry of the rocksalt substructure , the matrix elements between the zr @xmath47 band along @xmath32 and the bands derived from all other zr @xmath7 and sn @xmath6 orbitals vanish , resulting in zero anticrossing . for the gap to form ,",
    "it is necessary to include the ni @xmath7 orbitals , lowering the symmetry of the system to @xmath50 .",
    "although the ni @xmath7 states lie well below the fermi level , the ni @xmath47 and @xmath51 orbitals mediate an _",
    "indirect _ interaction between the zr @xmath47 band and the bands derived from the zr @xmath51 and sn @xmath52 orbitals .",
    "these interactions lead to a nonzero anticrossing of these bands , opening the gap at the fermi level .",
    "therefore , the symmetry breaking produced by the third element ( ni ) sublattice is the essential additional ingredient in the formation of the gap .",
    "the analysis of the previous section showed that the states near the fermi level in the @xmath17 phase of nisnzr are dominated by the atomic orbitals of the snzr rocksalt substructure .",
    "this suggests an approach to the analysis of the electronic structure and stability of the ternary compound through the identification of a key binary substructure . in this approach ,",
    "the essential features of electronic structure and stability should already be evident in the binary substructure , while addition of the third element sublattice leads to recognizable modifications such as ( i ) introduction of extra orbitals hybridizing with the orbitals of the binary substructure , ( ii ) change in the symmetry of the crystal structure , and ( iii ) charge transfer between the binary substructure and the third element sublattice , and other changes in the self - consistent charge density .",
    "we apply this approach to nisnzr by computing the total energies and band structures for the binary substructures appearing in the decomposition of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases .",
    "there are six distinct substructures : snzr , nizr and nisn in the rocksalt ( @xmath53 ) and zincblende ( @xmath54 ) structures .",
    "the total energies of these six substructures at the lattice constant of the @xmath17 phase , with lists of the corresponding nisnzr phases , are given in table iv .",
    "for each of the three binary compositions , the lower energy structure ( between @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) is the one contained in the decomposition of the @xmath17 phase .",
    "however , consideration of the magnitudes of the @xmath53-@xmath54 energy differences singles out the decomposition containing the snzr substructure .",
    "the @xmath53 structure of snzr is 2.03 ev lower in energy than the @xmath54 structure .",
    "this value is quite close to the energy difference between the @xmath17 phase , containing the @xmath53 snzr substructure , and the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases , which contain the @xmath54 snzr substructure ( 2.28 ev and 2.85 ev , respectively ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath53-@xmath54 energy differences for nizr and nisn are too small ( 0.26 ev and 0.23 ev per unit cell , respectively ) to be relevant to the stabilization of the @xmath17 phase relative to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases .",
    "therefore , the low energy of the nisnzr compound in the @xmath17 phase can be mainly attributed to the stability of the snzr @xmath53 substructure .",
    "there also appear to be useful relationships between the band structures of the ternary compounds and those of binary substructures .",
    "for example , the @xmath17 phase of nisnzr , where the snzr substructure is rocksalt , has a gap while the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases , with snzr in a zincblende arrangement , are both metallic .",
    "we investigate these relationships in more detail by examining the band structures of the six substructures ( fig .",
    "9 ) and comparing them with the band structures of the ternary @xmath17 [ fig .",
    "8(a ) ] , @xmath18 [ fig .",
    "7(a ) ] and @xmath19 [ fig .",
    "7(b ) ] phases . in the @xmath54 phases of nisn and nizr , the crystal field splittings of the ni and zr @xmath7 states at @xmath27 are noticeably larger than in the @xmath53 phases .",
    "the reason is that the point symmetry is lowered from @xmath49 in the @xmath53 structure to @xmath50 in the @xmath54 structure , resulting in a mutual repulsion of @xmath22 type @xmath7 and @xmath6 orbitals in the latter .",
    "comparison of the @xmath53 with the @xmath54 band structures for the three compositions shows a striking difference between nizr and nisn , on the one hand , and snzr , on the other hand , in the position of the fermi level and dispersion of the nearby bands . the very small change in the position of the fermi levels for the two structures of nizr and nisn is not surprising , because the ni @xmath7 orbitals are rather low - lying , and do not substantially affect states around the fermi level in these compounds .",
    "in contrast , the arrangement of the bands and position of the fermi level changes noticeably from snzr @xmath53 to snzr @xmath54 .",
    "this occurs because zr @xmath7 and sn @xmath6 orbitals are partially occupied orbitals involved in bonding , making the band dispersions and the positions of the fermi level quite sensitive to the atomic arrangement .",
    "we can also compare the band structures of the three phases of the ternary compound with the band structures of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 structures of snzr that appear in their decompositions .",
    "for example , comparison of fig .",
    "8(a ) and the band structure of snzr in the @xmath53 structure ( fig .",
    "9 ) shows that the low - lying sn @xmath5 band , the conduction bands well above the fermi level , and the bands arising from the sn @xmath28 , @xmath29 and zr @xmath30 , @xmath31 hybridizations ( labelled by @xmath55 in fig .",
    "9 ) look quite similar to those in fig .",
    "8(a ) . on the other hand , the @xmath48 band in fig .",
    "9 , arising from the doubly degenerate @xmath56 state and ending up as the @xmath57 state at @xmath21 is substantially modified by the introduction of the ni sublattice . in the ternary compound ,",
    "this band anticrosses due to the presence of ni @xmath7 orbitals and reduced point group symmetry .",
    "closer examination shows that the introduction of the ni @xmath7 orbital greatly increases the crystal field splitting of the zr @xmath7 states at @xmath27 , with the fermi level in the @xmath17 phase of nisnzr placed just inside this splitting .",
    "thus , within the substructure decomposition approach , we can account for the formation of the gap .",
    "the band structure of nisnzr in the @xmath19 phase [ fig .",
    "7(b ) ] also has similarities with the band structure of snzr in the @xmath54 structure ( fig .",
    "9 ) . since the sn @xmath58zr @xmath7 interaction pushes the @xmath22 type zr @xmath7 states down in energy in the @xmath54 structure , the introduction of ni @xmath7 orbitals results in the formation of a @xmath7-band complex below the fermi level , while the downward dispersing bands well above the fermi level are not substantially affected by this . on the other hand , the relationship between the band structure of the @xmath18 phase of nisnzr [ fig .",
    "7(a ) ] with the band structure of its @xmath54 snzr substructure is much more complicated , because introducing the ni @xmath7 orbitals changes the mixing of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals to a greater extent due to double tetrahedral coordination of sn . in this case , it is not possible to treat the effects of the ni @xmath7 orbitals perturbatively .      the ni@xmath0snm compounds can be produced from the @xmath17 phase of nisnm by adding a ni sublattice , which changes the system from a narrow gap semiconductor to a metal .",
    "the effect of the additional sublattice responsible for this change in electronic structure is the raising of the noncentrosymmetric @xmath50 symmetry to the centrosymmetric @xmath49 point group symmetry , with consequent changes in the symmetry properties of atomic - orbital bloch functions . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath59 denotes any of the five @xmath7 or @xmath5 orbitals of ni , the functions that transform according to the irreducible representations of the point group of any high symmetry point in the bz have the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) denotes the @xmath59 orbital of the @xmath63 ni atom in the unit cell .",
    "also , any orbital that transforms according to @xmath48 ( @xmath46 ) in the noncentrosymmetric compound transforms in ni@xmath0snm according to either @xmath48 or @xmath64 ( @xmath65 or @xmath66 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath48 and @xmath64 bands near the fermi level ( fig",
    ". 3 ) do not anticross as they do in nisnm , where they both carry the @xmath48 label . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath48 band cuts the fermi level , producing the metallic behavior .",
    "finally , in our calculations we do not see any evidence of a vacancy band@xcite proposed to explain the experimental data for nisnm .",
    "this is not too surprising for the perfectly clean samples on which our calculations were based , because unlike the case of heavy doped semiconductors , the vacancies in this system are very well ordered ( in an fcc lattice ) and have a high concentration .",
    "what light do these calculations shed on the experimentally observed electronic and optical properties of the nisnm compounds ?",
    "first of all , the very high low - temperature resistivities with a simple exponential temperature dependence observed in the nisnm compounds are consistent with the the appearance of a semiconducting gap in the calculated band structures . however , specific heat measurements show a small but finite dos at the fermi level.@xcite furthermore , the calculated gaps are all near 0.5 ev .",
    "these are more than twice as large as the gap parameters 0.12 , 0.19 , and 0.22 ev for ti- , zr- , and hf - based compounds , respectively , extracted from resistivity measurements@xcite and features in the optical reflectivity @xmath67.@xcite while lda errors ( either underestimates or overestimates ) in the values of the band gaps are expected , a more serious problem which could give rise to these discrepancies is poor sample quality , particularly substitutional disorder . in nisnzr , there is direct evidence from x - ray diffraction for sn - zr substitutional disorder at the 10 - 30% level.@xcite the degree of substitutional disorder seems to be correlated with changes in the electronic properties .",
    "one example of this is that the dos at the fermi level appears to decrease as the degree of disorder decreases .",
    "in particular , the zero temperature resistivity increases dramatically upon annealing the samples.@xcite also , the dos at the fermi level from specific heat measurements@xcite is lowest for the ti - based compound , which has the smallest disorder in the position of the ti and sn atoms , indicating that a complete gap may be expected to open in a very clean sample . to improve our understanding of the effect of the sn - zr substitutional disorder on the size of the gap , we performed total energy and band - structure calculations for ni(sn@xmath68zr@xmath69)(sn@xmath69zr@xmath68 ) for a few values of @xmath70 between 0 and 0.5 in the virtual crystal approximation . at around @xmath71 ,",
    "the gap closes to form a semimetal , with the valence band maximum ( conduction band minimum ) moving up ( down ) in energy and touching the fermi level . therefore , to achieve experimental gap values comparable to those calculated for the ideal crystals , special attention to sample preparation is needed .",
    "in such well - ordered samples , reflectivity measurements would have to be extended to higher frequencies than those used in previous studies ( in ref .",
    "@xmath72 5000 @xmath73 ) to see the onset of absorption .",
    "direct relations between the formation of a ( pseudo)gap and the stability of the structure have been proposed in several contexts , including the hume rothery rule,@xcite jahn - teller effects in molecules , @xcite and the `` coloring '' patterns of atoms over the sites of a given lattice.@xcite if the formation of a gap in the dos is an important factor in the structural stability of intermetallic compounds , the expectation is that semiconducting intermetallics would be fairly common , while , as we have already discussed , they are quite rare .",
    "therefore , it is useful to examine this issue in the present case .    for nisnm compounds in their @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 phases , it is true that the structure with the gap has the lowest energy , and there is a correlation between the dos at the fermi level and the structural energies of the three phases .",
    "however , the present calculations suggest that the formation of the gap is not directly responsible for the structural stability . instead",
    ", the stability can be understood from the substructure decomposition approach . as discussed in sec .",
    "iv b , the energy of the snzr @xmath53 structure is 2.03 ev per unit cell lower than that of the @xmath54 structure . from fig .",
    "9 , it is clear that neither the @xmath53 nor the @xmath54 snzr structures have a gap .",
    "the ternary phases are obtained by incorporating the ni sublattice into the binary snzr substructures .",
    "this incorporation produces a gap in the @xmath17 phase , as a result of symmetry breaking , but leads to only a small change in the relative energy ( from 2.03 ev per unit cell to energy differences of 2.28 ev and 2.85 ev per unit cell between the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the stabilization of the lowest energy phase is primarily due to the relative stability of the binary snzr @xmath53 substructure , while the contribution to stabilization associated with the incorporation of the third element ( ni ) sublattice , which results in the formation of the gap , is relatively minor .",
    "this conclusion is not inconsistent with the relations between gap formation and stability observed elsewhere . in the hume - rothery rule ,",
    "a gap in the dos establishes the limit of stability of a particular alloy structure as a function of electron count , rather than an enhanced stability specifically of the semiconducting phase . in the jahn - teller and coloring analyses ,",
    "the correlation between structural stability and gap formation is identified in classes of structures which are otherwise extremely similar ( related by small structural relaxations in the jahn - teller case and possessing identical nearest neighbor environments for the cations in the coloring problem ) . however , in the nisnm compounds , the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases are related by sublattice interchanges , not small displacements , resulting in different nearest neighbor environments in each phase .",
    "it is therefore reasonable that the substructure decomposition approach , with the identification of the low - energy rocksalt snzr substructure , should be a more useful indicator of structural stability than gap formation for these compounds .      from these results ,",
    "the simple chemical and structural trends in gap formation can be identified and used to assist in the prediction of new semiconducting intermetallics .",
    "we have already seen that a closed shell rule with 18 electrons is too simple .",
    "the ternary nature of the compounds , particularly the electronegativity difference between the constituents of the rocksalt substructure , and the structural arrangement , particularly the double tetrahedral coordination of the late transition metal , seem to be important factors , since the hypothetical compounds nisn@xmath0 and nizr@xmath0 , and the @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases of nisnm compounds are metallic.@xcite on the other hand , the empirical rule that the total number of @xmath7 electrons from the two transition metals in their ground states should be 10 works for the nisnm compounds as well as for the compounds formed by the column substitutions of ni with pd and pt.@xcite it is also necessary that the transition metal that is doubly tetrahedrally coordinated should have a significantly larger number of @xmath7 electrons in the atomic ground state , so that the bands originating from these @xmath7 orbitals will lie deep below the fermi level , and not destroy the @xmath4 hybridizations by mixing significantly with the @xmath7 orbitals of the other transition metal .",
    "covsn in the mgagas structure with co doubly tetrahedrally coordinated by sn and v satisfies these rules .",
    "first - principles band structure calculations confirm that covsn has an @xmath74 gap of 0.8 ev at the fermi level ( fig .",
    "this compound is not reported to exist in the intermetallic compound database .",
    "however , there is a good chance that this might be a stable compound based on the analogy with the @xmath17 phase of nisnm compounds .",
    "therefore , we predict that if this compound can successfully be prepared in this structure , it will be a semiconducting intermetallic .",
    "in this paper , we used the pseudopotential total energy method to investigate the stability and electronic structure of the ternary intermetallic compounds nisnm ( m = ti , zr , hf ) .",
    "our calculations revealed an indirect semiconducting gap near 0.5 ev for all three compounds in the lowest energy @xmath17 phase , while the inversion symmetric ni@xmath0snm compounds and the higher energy @xmath18 and @xmath19 phases of nisnm were found to be metallic . from a tight - binding analysis of the first - principles bands and charge densities , both the @xmath4 hybridization on the snzr rocksalt substructure and the symmetry breaking due to the ni sublattice",
    "were found to be crucial factors in gapping the electronic spectrum of @xmath17-nisnzr . by considering all binary substructures which appear in the decomposition of the three phases of nisnzr",
    ", we concluded that the stabilization of the lowest energy @xmath17 phase is primarily due to the relative stability of the binary snzr @xmath53 substructure , while the contribution to stabilization associated with the incorporation of the third element ( ni ) sublattice , which results in the formation of the gap , is relatively minor .",
    "analysis of the band structures for the narrow gap semiconductor nisnzr and the metallic ni@xmath0snzr showed that the raising of the point group symmetry from the noncentrosymmetric @xmath50 to the centrosymmetric @xmath49 group by the addition of the ni sublattice is responsible for this difference in the electronic properties .",
    "our theoretical findings are consistent with experimental observations , if poor sample quality and substitutional disorder in the samples are taken into account .",
    "finally , we predicted that the ternary compound covsn in the mgagas structure with an snv rocksalt substructure will form a semiconducting intermetallic , if it can be prepared successfully in this structure .",
