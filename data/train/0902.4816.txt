    "nanofabrication techniques developed over the last decade  @xcite , together with atomic - scale manipulation using scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite , have sparked intense interest in novel mesoscopic devices where strong electron correlation and many - body effects play a central role  @xcite .",
    "the classic spin-@xmath0 kondo effect  @xcite  in which a single spin is screened by antiferromagnetic coupling to conduction electrons in an attached metallic lead  has been observed in odd - electron semiconductor quantum dots , single molecule dots , and adatoms on metallic surfaces  @xcite ; although its ferromagnetic counterpart , where the spin remains asymptotically free , has yet to be reported experimentally . in _ coupled _ dot devices ",
    "the ` molecular ' analogue of single quantum dots viewed as artificial atoms  @xcite  exquisite experimental control is now available over geometry , capacitance , and tunnel - couplings of the dots  @xcite .",
    "both spin and internal , orbital degrees of freedom  and hence the interplay between the two  are important in such systems .",
    "this leads to greater diversity in potentially observable correlated electron behaviour on coupling to metallic leads , as evident from a wide range of theoretical studies of double ( e.g. refs .  ) and triple ( e.g. refs .  )",
    "quantum dot systems .    motivated in part by recent experiments involving triple dot devices  @xcite",
    ", we consider here a system of three , mutually tunnel - coupled single - level quantum dots , one of which is connected to a metallic lead : a triple quantum dot ( tqd ) ring structure , the simplest to exhibit frustration .",
    "we focus on the tqd in the 3-electron coulomb blockade valley , and study its evolution as a function of the interdot tunnel couplings , using both perturbative arguments and the full density matrix  @xcite formulation of wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) technique  @xcite ( for a recent review , see ref .  ) .",
    "a rich range of behaviour is found to occur .",
    "both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic kondo physics are shown to arise in the system  with the two distinct ground states separated by a quantum phase transition  and should be experimentally accessible via side - gate control of the tunnel couplings . the zero - bias differential conductance ( @xmath1 ) through the dots is shown to drop discontinuously across the transition at zero temperature , from the unitarity limit of @xmath2 in the strong coupling antiferromagnetic phase ( with @xmath3 the conductance quantum ) to @xmath4 in the weak coupling , local moment phase .",
    "however in a certain temperature window in the vicinity of the transition , the conductance is found to be controlled by the transition fixed point separating the two ground state phases , comprising both a kondo singlet state and a residual local moment ; in particular such that _ increasing _ temperature in the local moment phase actually revives the antiferromagnetic kondo effect .",
    "schematic illustration of the quantum dot trimer.,height=75 ]",
    "we consider three semiconducting ( single - level ) quantum dots , arranged in a triangular geometry as illustrated in fig  [ dots ] . each dot is tunnel - coupled to the others , and one of them ( dot ` 2 ' )",
    "is also coupled to a metallic lead .",
    "we focus explicitly on a system tuned to mirror symmetry ( see fig .  [ dots ] ) , and study the anderson - type model @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 refers to the non - interacting lead , which is coupled to dot ` 2 ' via @xmath7 , while @xmath8 describes the isolated tqd with tunnel couplings @xmath9 , @xmath10   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the number operator for dot @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the intradot coulomb repulsion and @xmath14 the level energy of dot @xmath12 , such that @xmath15 for a mirror symmetric system ( in which @xmath16 is invariant under a @xmath17 permutation ) . for convenience",
    "we take @xmath18 for all dots ( although this is not required , as mentioned further below ) .",
    "we are interested in the tqd deep in the @xmath19 electron coulomb blockade valley . to this end , noting that coupled quantum dot experiments typically correspond to @xmath20  @xcite , we consider the representative case @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "each dot is then in essence singly occupied , with @xmath23 or @xmath24 states much higher ( @xmath25@xmath26 ) in energy .",
    "the @xmath19 states of the isolated tqd comprise two lowest doublets , and a spin quartet ( which always lies highest in energy ) .",
    "as the tunnel coupling @xmath27 is increased there is a level crossing of the doublets , which are degenerate by symmetry at the point @xmath28 .",
    "projected into the singly - occupied manifold the doublet states are @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 for spins @xmath32 .",
    "their energy separation is @xmath33 with antiferromagnetic exchange couplings @xmath34 and @xmath35 , such that the levels cross at @xmath28 ( reflecting the magnetic frustration inherent at this point ) .",
    "the @xmath36 doublet , containing triplet configurations of spins ` 1 ' and ` 3 ' , has odd parity ( @xmath37 ) under a @xmath17 interchange ; while @xmath38 , which has singlet - locked spins ` 1 ' and ` 3 ' and behaves in  effect as a spin-@xmath0 carried by dot ` 2 ' alone , has even parity ( @xmath39 ) .    on coupling to the lead the effective model describing the system on low energy / temperature scales is obtained by a standard schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite . provided the doublets are not close to degeneracy , only the lower such state need be retained in the ground state manifold : @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 . in either case a low - energy model of kondo form arises @xmath44 ( potential scattering is omitted for clarity ) , with @xmath45 the conduction band spin density at dot ` 2 ' , and @xmath46 a spin-@xmath0 operator representing the appropriate doublet ( @xmath47 or @xmath37 ) .",
    "the effective kondo coupling is @xmath48 with @xmath49 the spin of dot ` 2 ' ; where @xmath50 with hybridization @xmath51 and @xmath52 the lead density of states .",
    "eqn.([eq : states ] ) thus gives @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "hence , for tunnel coupling @xmath55 ( @xmath41 ) , a _ _",
    "ferro__magnetic spin-@xmath0 kondo effect arises ( @xmath56 )  @xcite .",
    "kondo quenching of the lowest doublet is in consequence ineffective , and as temperature @xmath57 the spin becomes asymptotically free  the stable fixed point ( fp ) is the local moment ( lm ) fp with a residual entropy @xmath58 ( @xmath59 )  @xcite .",
    "the system here is the simplest example of a ` singular fermi liquid '  @xcite , reflected in the non - analyticity of leading irrelevant corrections to the fixed point  @xcite . for @xmath60 by contrast , the kondo coupling is antiferromagnetic ( @xmath61 ) , destabilizing the lm fixed point . the strong coupling ( sc )",
    "fp then controls the @xmath57 behaviour , describing the familiar fermi liquid kondo singlet ground state in which the spin is screened by the lead / conduction electrons below the characteristic kondo scale @xmath62 , with @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "since the fixed points for the two stable phases are distinct , a quantum phase transition must thus occur on tuning the tunnel coupling @xmath27 through a critical value @xmath64 .",
    "we study it below , but first outline the effective low - energy model in the vicinity of the transition . here ,",
    "as the @xmath65 states are of course near degenerate , both doublets must thus be retained in the low - energy trimer manifold , and the unity operator for the local ( dot ) hilbert space is hence : @xmath66 the effective low - energy model then obtained by schrieffer - wolff is readily shown to be @xmath67 with @xmath68 as above .",
    "the final term here refers simply to the energy difference between the two doublets .",
    "it may be written equivalently as @xmath69 with a pseudospin operator @xmath70 thus defined , such that the doublets are each eigenstates of it , @xmath71 .",
    "considering now the first term in eqn.([eq : fpa ] ) , @xmath72 for the mirror symmetric case considered ( cross terms vanish by symmetry ) .",
    "direct evaluation of @xmath73 gives @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 , where @xmath46 is a spin-@xmath0 operator for the dot hilbert space ( specifically @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "hence , using eqns.([eq : unity],[eq : pseud ] ) to express @xmath79 in terms of the pseudospin , the effective low - energy model is given from eqn.([eq : fpa ] ) by @xmath80 expressed as desired in terms of the spin @xmath46 and pseudospin @xmath81 .",
    "the term @xmath69 is equivalent to a magnetic field acting on the pseudospin , favoring the @xmath36 doublet for @xmath82 and @xmath38 for @xmath83 ; such that eqn.([eq : fp ] ) reduces , as it should , to one or other of eqn.([eq : jeff ] ) in the limit where the separation @xmath84 is sufficiently large that only one of the doublets need be retained in the low - energy tqd manifold .",
    "finally , note that the absence of pseudospin raising / lowering terms @xmath85 in @xmath86 reflects the strict @xmath17 parity in the mirror symmetric setup ( which can not be broken by virtual hopping processes between dot ` 2 ' and the lead ) ; and means that the hilbert space of eqn.([eq : fp ] ) separates exactly into spin and pseudospin sectors , such that only the _ sign _ of the effective kondo coupling is correlated to the pseudospin .",
    "the physical picture is thus clear , and indicates the presence of a quantum phase transition as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "we now present nrg results for the tqd anderson model , using a symmetric , constant lead density of states @xmath87 .",
    "the full density matrix extension  @xcite of the nrg is employed  @xcite , together with direct calculation of the electron self - energy  @xcite .",
    "calculations are typically performed for an nrg discretization parameter @xmath88 , retaining the lowest @xmath89 states per iteration .",
    "as above we choose @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which realistic case  @xcite corresponds to single occupancy of the dots ( all calculations give @xmath92 for each dot ) .",
