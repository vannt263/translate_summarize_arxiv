    "the proposed structures can be considered as cloning machines of one initial input state .",

    "we present and justify the required tuning of the coupling strengths between nearest neigbours that creates maximum entanglement between the last oscillators in the output arms , and provide the resulting unitary transformation between initial and final states .",
    "we show different results varying the system parameters and compare them with previous ones and with the upper limit for entanglement generation in the system .",

    "finally we study x - shaped structures which work as entanglement beam splitters .",
    "in section [ cloning ] we study the action of the same structures as a cloning machines in which the final states in the last oscillators of the output arms can be considered as imperfect copies of the initial input state .",
    "we provide the fidelity expression in terms of the squeezing parameter and also extend the results to multiarm structures which creates multiple more imperfect copies .",

    "when considering pure states , the appropriate measure of entanglement is the entropy of entanglement which is defined as the von - neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of one subsystem . in the gaussian states setting this reduced density matrix",
    "is again described by a covariance matrix @xmath27 and the displacements . as displacements represent local unitary basis changes they are irrelevant when considering the entanglement properties of a gaussian state .",

    "only nearest neighbour interactions are considered and it is assumed that the structure is initially in the ground state , i.e. , at temperature @xmath45 . at time @xmath46 we perturb the first harmonic oscillator in the input arm exciting it either to a thermal state characterized by covariance matrix elements @xmath47 for some @xmath48 , or a pure squeezed state characterized by covariance matrix elements @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{gamma1}\\ ] ]    we observe that for an initial thermal state excitation no entanglement is ever found between the ends of the two arms of the y - shape .",
    "this can be understood from the observation that a thermal state is a mixture of coherent states , i.e. , displaced vacuum states .",
    "displacements do not contribute to the entanglement in a state so that it is sufficient to consider the vacuum state .",
    "if the system is initialized in the vacuum state however it remains stationary and will evidently not lead to any entanglement as long as we are considering the rwa .",
    "therefore an initialization in a thermal state can not yield entanglement either .    for a squeezed state input on the other hand a considerable amount of entanglement",
    "is generated .",
    "these two observations are resembling closely optical beamsplitters which do not create entanglement from thermal state input but can generate entanglement from squeezed inputs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive treatment of the entangling capacity of linear optical devices ) .",
    "it is now natural to consider which nearest neighbour coupling provides the optimal generation of entanglement .",
    "these optimal couplings can be found numerically by adjusting randomly individual couplings , accepting changes that improve the amount of entanglement that is being generated in the structure at a given time for a given input .",
    "the results so obtained provide the intuition by which one then arrives at an analytical argument . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that it is possible to obtain perfect transmission in a linear chain of @xmath51 oscillators if the couplings are adjusted in a square root law @xmath52 with this potential matrix an interchange between the first and the @xmath51-th coordinate occurs by waiting for a time @xmath53 ( see ref.@xcite for an analogous argument in spin chains ) .    to obtain the equivalent perfect transmission distributed between the arms in the y - shaped structure",
    ", we must modify the coupling strengths between the oscillator in the junction and the first two oscillators in the arms , @xmath54 , in the following way @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ vprofile ] these couplings are shown for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    to understand the origin of this choice of coupling strengths we link it to perfect transmission in a linear chain .",
    "indeed , with a basis change between both systems it can be proved that the choice of coupling for the y - shape corresponds to perfect transmission in a linear structure consisting of the incoming arm and one outgoing arm while the other outgoing arm is becoming decoupled ( see fig .",
    "[ trafofigure ] ) .",
    "labelling the two arms with @xmath58 we take oscillators by pairs in the same position @xmath23 of each arm , and make the following change just in arms ( see fig .",
    "[ yshape ] ) @xmath59 with analogous equations for momentum operators @xmath60 . introducing this change in the expression for the system hamiltonian ( [ hrwa ] )",
    "we obtain that @xmath31 arm gets the perfect transmission coupling strengths eq .",
    "( [ vsqrt ] ) , while @xmath32 arm is decoupled .",
    "how does this allow us to obtain the optimal couplings for the y - shape ?",
    "first , we consider the transformed y - shape depicted on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ trafofigure ] .",
    "we perform the same procedure carried out for the linear chain ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an analytical proof of optimality ) to obtain the optimized couplings for this situation . transforming back to the original coordinates , ie the situation on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ trafofigure ] , we then obtain the coupling strengths suggested in eqs .",
    "( [ vsqrt]-[vjunc ] ) .",
    "this then implies that the initially squeezed state is , in the transformed picture , transmitted perfectly to the end of the outgoing arms .",
    "inverting the transformation , which is indeed the same transformation as that implemented by a 50/50 beamsplitter , we then obtain a two - mode squeezed state in the original picture .",
    "the results in @xcite imply that the transformation corresponding to a 50/50 beamsplitter is the optimal linear optics entangling transformation for an initial squeezed state .",
    "this implies that the procedure as a whole , ie the choice of couplings , is optimal  at least in the gaussian setting .",
    "if the initial quantum state of the first oscillator is squeezed the final states in the last oscillators in the present maximum entanglement at that time , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ lognegt ] , where logarithmic negativity is shown . the only effect of increasing the number of oscillators ( adjusting couplings accordingly ) is to narrow the peaks without decreasing the maximum entanglement .",
    "this is contrasted by the behaviour of a system in which all the couplings between nearest neighbours are equal .",
    "then the magnitude of the entanglement decreases as the number of oscillator increases , and irregular time patterns are obtained @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ lognegtmout ] we can see how entanglement propagates through the output arms in the y - shaped structure . for each pair of oscillators occupying the same position @xmath23 in each arm we measure entanglement at each time",

    "<S> we study creation of bi- and multipartite continuous variable entanglement in structures of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators . by adjusting the interaction strengths between nearest neighbors </S>",
    "<S> we show how to maximize the entanglement production between the arms in a y - shaped structure where an initial single mode squeezed state is created in the first oscillator of the input arm . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the action of the same structure as an approximate quantum cloner . for a specific time in the system dynamics </S>",
    "<S> the last oscillators in the output arms can be considered as imperfect copies of the initial state . by increasing the number of arms in the structure , </S>",
    "<S> multipartite entanglement is obtained , as well as @xmath0 cloning . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we are considering configurations that implement the symmetric splitting of an initial entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations are carried out within the framework of the rotating wave approximation in quantum optics , and our predictions could be tested with current available experimental techniques . </S>"
