    "a rational motion is a motion with only rational trajectories . in the dual quaternion model of @xmath0 , the group of rigid body displacements , (",
    "9 ) it is described by a rational curve on the study quadric @xcite . in this article",
    "we construct a rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model with a given rational curve as trajectory , and we show that this motion is unique up to coordinate changes .",
    "this is an interesting result in its own right but it also has a certain potential for applications in computer graphics , computer aided design or mechanism science .    usually , one defines the degree of a rational motion as the maximal degree of a trajectory @xcite . with this concept of motion degree ,",
    "our problem becomes trivial as the curvilinear translation along the curve is already minimal . as we shall see",
    ", it is also minimal with respect to the dual quaternion degree if the prescribed trajectory is generic",
    ". the situation changes , however , if the trajectory is _ circular _ , that is , it intersects the absolute circle at infinity . in this case , the minimal achievable degree in the dual quaternion model is the curve degree minus half the number of conjugate complex intersection points with the absolute circle at infinity ( the curve s _ circularity _ ) .",
    "we will see that twice the circularity of a trajectory equals the trajectory degree minus the degree defect in the spherical component of the minimal motion .",
    "this leads to the rather strange observation that generic rational motions ( without spherical degree defect ) have very special ( entirely circular ) trajectories .",
    "conversely , the minimal motion to generic ( non - circular ) curves are curvilinear translations which are special in the sense that their spherical degree defect is maximal .",
    "we continue this article with an introduction to the dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements in .",
    "there we also introduce motion polynomials and their relation to rational motions . our results are formulated and proved in .",
    "the proof of the central result ( ) is constructive and can be used to actually compute the minimal rational motion by a variant of the euclidean algorithm .",
    "we illustrate this procedure by two examples .",
    "in this article , we work in the dual quaternion model of the group of rigid body displacements .",
    "this model requires a minimal number of parameters while retaining a bilinear composition law .",
    "moreover , it provides a rich algebraic and geometric structure .",

    "a dual quaternion may be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are quaternions .",
    "the conjugate dual quaternion is @xmath11 and conjugation of quaternions is done by multiplying the coefficients of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "it can readily be verified that the dual quaternion norm , defined as @xmath16 , equals @xmath17 .",
    "it is a dual number .",
    "the non - invertible dual quaternions @xmath8 are precisely those with vanishing primal part @xmath18 .",
    "an important application of dual quaternions is the modelling of rigid body displacements .",
    "the group of dual quaternions of unit norm modulo @xmath19 is isomorphic to @xmath0 , the group of rigid body displacements .",

    "it is convenient and customary to projectivise the space @xmath1 of dual quaternions , thus arriving at @xmath24 , the real projective space of dimension seven .",

    "the point @xmath20 represented by @xmath34 is mapped according to @xmath35 this is a convenient representation for studying rational curves as trajectories of rational motions .      in the projective setting ,",
    "a rational motion is simply a curve in the study quadric @xmath29 that admits a parameterisation by a polynomial @xmath36 with dual quaternion coefficients @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath47 has dual numbers as coefficients .",
    "if @xmath47 has even _ real _ coefficients and the leading coefficient @xmath48 is invertible , we call @xmath41 a _ motion polynomial . _ this is motivated by the observation that the curve parameterised by a motion polynomial is contained in the study quadric , that is , it parameterises indeed a rigid body motion .",

    "the maximal degree of a trajectory is two .",
    "let us illustrate by two examples :    the rational curve given by the parameterised equations @xmath280 is of degree five . from the factorisation",
    "@xmath281 we see that its circularity is two . by , it is trajectory of a rational motion of minimal degree three whose primal part , by , has precisely one linear factor . with @xmath119 , @xmath243 and @xmath60 defined by @xmath282 we have @xmath283 setting @xmath284 and using the euclidean algorithm we compute , according to , the left gcd @xmath219 of @xmath185 and @xmath60 : with @xmath285 and @xmath286 we have @xmath287 , @xmath288 .",
    "then we set @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "as expected , @xmath50 has a real polynomial factor of degree @xmath111 .",
    "the motion polynomial we want is @xmath291 .",
    "[ ex:3 ] the viviani curve @xcite is given by @xmath292 in order to meet the requirements of , we translate it by the vector @xmath293 and obtain @xmath294 this curve lies on the unit sphere and is entirely circular . as in the previous example , we compute @xmath295 the left gcd of @xmath250 and @xmath60 is @xmath296 the right quotient of @xmath185 and @xmath219 is @xmath297 and the minimal motion to the curve is @xmath298 we can simplify by conjugating with @xmath299 whence we get @xmath300 this shows that @xmath301 is the composition of two rotations about the second coordinate axis and the third coordinate axis with equal angular velocities , i.e. , the motion generated by the rolling of a spherical circle of radius @xmath302 on a spherical circle of the same radius .",
    "this is illustrated in .",
    "there , the moving frame is rigidly attached to the rolling circle .",
    "this article unveiled some relations between rational motions and their trajectories .",
    "a rational curve occurs as trajectory of a unique ( up to coordinate changes ) rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model .",
    "this was a surprise to the authors as a mere trajectory seems to leave a lot of freedom for the construction of a suitable rational motion .",
    "apparently , the requirement for minimality is rather restrictive .",
    "calling a rational curve `` generic '' if its circularity is zero and a rational motion `` generic '' if its primal part has no real factors ( the spherical motion component has full degree ) , we may also say that rational motions of minimal quaternion degree to a generic trajectory are non - generic .",
    "conversely , the trajectories of a generic rational motion are entirely circular and hence non generic .    in conjunction with the factorisation of generic rational motions @xcite and its extension @xcite to non - generic motion polynomials ,",
    "our results contribute to a variant of kempe s universality theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.2 ) for rational space curves . via motion factorisation",
    ", it is possible to construct linkages to generate a given rational motion and hence also a given rational trajectory .",
    "the dual quaternion degree of the generating motion is directly related to the number of links and joints in the mechanism . as a consequence",
    ", rational curves can be generated by spatial linkages with much fewer links and joints than those implied by the asymptotic bounds for algebraic space curves given by @xcite .",
    "for circular curves , the numbers of links and joints are even less . a precise formulation and a rigorous proof will be worked out in a future paper .",
    "our main result in corollary  [ cor:2 ] raises questions .",
    "is a similar uniqueness statement true for algebraic curves and algebraic motions ?",
    "what rational motions are not minimal for any of their trajectories ?",
    "the darboux motion and the circular translation of remark  [ rem:1 ] are examples .",
    "finally , determine simple ( classes of ) curves with simple minimal motion as in example  [ ex:3 ] and exploit their low degree and rationality in a cagd or engineering context .",
