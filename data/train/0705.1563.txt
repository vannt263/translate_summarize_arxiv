    "more than two hundred extrasolar planets have now been detected , revealing surprising diversity .",
    "doppler surveys have provided a large database of masses , orbital radii and eccentricities , which show notably few ( and a few notable ) systematics , as for example the relationship between stellar metallicity and the number of detected planets ( fischer & valenti , 2005 ) .",
    "transit detections are now also beginning to show a large diversity in the internal structure of planets with otherwise very similar properties ( guillot _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",

    "_ 2005 , sicilia - aguilar _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) and/or mid - ir wavelengths ( mamajek _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) steadily decreases from nearly 100% for stars within the youngest clusters , to zero for stars within clusters older than about 20 myr .",
    "this correlation has long been interpreted as clear evidence for disk dispersal within a typical timescale of about 10myr , but is now beginning to gather additional interest as evidence for a large variation in the disk dispersal rates amongst similar type stars within the same cluster .",
    "this dispersion could be related to variations in the initial disk conditions and/or to the characteristics of the host star ( hueso & guillot , 2005 ) .",
    "other possible tracers of disk structure and/or evolution ( such as the crystallinity fraction and grain growth ) also reveal significant diversity : for instance , co - eval stars of similar types show evidence for very different crystallinity fractions ( meeus _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 for t tauri stars , apai _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 for brown dwarves ) .",
    "can the origin of this dynamical and structural diversity indeed be traced back to the initial conditions of the disk ? qualitatively speaking ,",
    "can it explain why some systems form planets while others do nt ?",
    "quantitatively speaking , is there a link between the initial angular momentum and mass of the disk and the characteristics of the emerging planetary system ?",
    "meanwhile , stringent upper bounds on the total amount of heavy elements typically remaining as planetary building blocks have been deduced from the very low metallicity dispersion measured amongst similar type stars within the same cluster by wilden _ et al . _",
    "this result is puzzling in the light of the contrastingly large range of observed disk survival timescales : how can widely different dynamics lead to similar retention efficiencies .",
    "a necessary step towards answering these questions is the development of a comprehensive numerical model capable of following the formation and evolution of planetary systems from their earliest stages to the present day , including all of the physical processes currently understood to play a role in the evolution of the gas and solids .",
    "the standard core - accretion model of planet formation begins with the condensation of heavy elements into small grains , followed by their stochastic collisional growth into successively larger aggregates until they reach a typical mass ( either collectively or individually ) where mutually induced gravitational forces begin to influence their motions .",
    "the small planetesimals then continue growing by accreting each other ( together with some of the disk gas ) , until a critical point is reached where runaway gas accretion may eventually begin .",
    "this first planetary formation phase ends with the dispersal of the disk gas , possibly by photo - evaporation , although gravitational interactions between the various bodies continue taking place resulting in close encounters ( sometimes collisions ) with dynamical rearrangement of the system ( including ejection , shattering , coagulation ) .    in this paper",
    "i present a numerical model for the first stage of this process , in which a protostellar disk and all of its contents ( both in gaseous and in solid form ) are evolved simultaneously until complete dispersal of the gas .",
    "the next stages of evolution from this point onward are best treated with an n - body code , for which the results presented here could be used as initial conditions .",
    "recent data obtained with the spitzer space telescope has provided valuable information on the evolution of grains in protostellar disks , which can be used to both construct and test the desired planet formation model . since the near- and mid - ir ranges of the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are essentially due to reprocessing of the stellar radiation by small dust grains ,",
    "the key to modeling planet formation in the context of evolving disks is to better understand the relationship between the observable seds and the physics which couple the gas and dust dynamics under the gravitational and radiative influence of a central star .",
    "this is done in paper ii ( alexander & garaud , 2007 ) .",
    "this work presents a new versatile numerical tool to study the evolution of both gas and solids in protostellar disks , from classical t tauri disks to transition disks and finally to forming planetary systems ( embedded perhaps in a debris disk ) . the model developed takes into account the following physical phenomena : ( i ) axisymmetric 1 + 1d gas dynamics around the central star , ( ii ) photo - evaporation by the central star , ( iii ) continuous grain size distribution maintained by growth and fragmentation , ( iv ) grain sublimation and condensation , ( v ) multiple grain species ( iron , silicates , ices ) , ( vi ) gas - grain coupling including turbulent dust suspension , turbulent diffusion and drift and ( vii ) gravitational interaction between forming embryos ( in a statistical sense ) .    while the general goal of modeling the early disk evolution has been pursued by many others before , this particular model is the first to include all of the physics listed above in a single , well - tested , fast and practical algorithm .",
    "other physical phenomena such as photo - evaporation by nearby stars , truncation of the disk by stellar fly - by , or planetary migration are easy to implement , but not discussed here . in order to place the model in context ,",
    "it is useful to summarize briefly existing work on the subject",
    ". a more thorough discussion of the results in the light of previous work can be found in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "axisymmetric _ gas _ dynamics in a viscously dominated accretion disk has been thoroughly analyzed by lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) . in subsequent work",
    ", particular attention was given to studying the disk structure and evolution in the light of sed observations ( see hartmann _",
    "_ 1998 for example ) .",
    "photo - evaporation of the gas by uv photons ( either ambient and/or emerging from central star ) is now thought to play a major role in the dispersal of the disk gas .",
    "this was studied in detail by hollenbach _",
    "( 1994 ) , and later proposed by clarke , gendrin & sotomayor ( 2001 ) as a possible model providing the characteristic `` two - timescale '' evolution ( namely a long lifetime with a rapid dispersal time ) required by the low relative abundance of transition disks ( see the reviews by hollenbach & gorti 2005 , and dullemond _ et al . _ 2007 )",
    ".    meanwhile , the study of the evolution of _ solids _ in protostellar disks also has a long history , where the particular emphasis has in the vast majority of cases been to model the formation of our own solar system .",
    "the early works of whipple ( 1972 ) and weidenschilling ( 1977 ) laid the foundation for studying the motion of small solid bodies in the early solar nebula .",
    "et al . _ ( 1980 ) developed a theory for the dynamical coupling of solid particles with turbulent eddies , which enabled many further studies of the collisional growth of dust grains into planetesimals ( weidenschilling , 1984 and subsequent papers , weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 , stepinski & valageas 1997 , suttner & yorke 2001 , dullemond & dominik , 2005 ) .",
    "finally , steady progress in the interpretation of various cosmochemistry data has prompted the need for a better understanding of the evolution of the various chemical species present in the disk , in particular water .",
    "in addition to their own work , ciesla & cuzzi ( 2006 ) present an excellent review of recent advances in the field .    combining the evolution of solids with the evolution of the gas with the aim of bridging the gap between sed interpretations and our own solar system formation",
    "is naturally the next step in this scientific exploration process .",
    "the work of suttner & yorke ( 2001 ) pioneered the concept when looking at grain growth and migration in the very early stages of the disk formation ( first few @xmath1 yr ) .",
    "alexander & armitage ( 2007 ) ( aa07 hereafter ) were recently the first to combine state - of - the - art photo - evaporation models with grain migration to gain a better understanding of the nature of some forming transition disks .",
    "the proposed model draws from many of the fundamental ideas of these previous studies ; in particular , it can be thought of as a generalization of the aa07 model which includes the effects of grain growth , sublimation and condensation .",
    "theoretical studies of dust growth typically require the solution of a collisional equation at every spatial position of the disk . amongst some of the difficulties encountered one could mention the determination of the particle structure , the sticking efficiency , the shattering threshold and the size distribution of the fragments , and not least the relative velocities of the particles before collision . indeed , while the motion of particles in a laminar disk is fairly easy to compute , matters are complicated when dynamical coupling between grains and turbulent eddies is taken into account .",
    "tiny grains are well - coupled with the gas though frictional drag , while larger `` boulders '' only feel the eddies as a random stochastic forcing .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion and the relative velocities of the particles can be modeled statistically provided one assumes the gas eddies follow a turbulent kolmogorov cascade from the macro - scale to the dissipation scale .",
    "this idea was originally proposed by voelk _",
    "et al . _ ( 1980 ) and more recently reviewed by various authors , notably weidenschilling ( 1984 ) .",
    "yorke & suttner ( 2001 ) and dullemond & dominik ( 2005 ) used these velocity prescriptions to evaluate the rate of growth of particles in protostellar disks by solving the full coagulation equation .",
    "their results show that the collisional growth of particles in the inner regions of the disk is too fast , unless shattering is taken into account .",
    "it is therefore vital to include it in evolutionary models of disks as well .",
    "however , solving for the complete coagulation / shattering equation for every particle size , at every timestep and for every position in the disk is computationally prohibitive .",
    "statistical surveys of the typical outcome of the disk evolution for a wide range of stellar parameters and initial conditions can not be done in this fashion .",
    "the novel part of this work concerns the modeling of the evolution of the grain size distribution function under collisional coagulation and shattering .",
    "the underlying assumption of the model proposed is that collisions between dust grains are frequent enough for a quasi - steady coagulation / shattering balance to be achieved in such a way as to maintain a power - law particle size distribution function with index @xmath2 as in the ism , but with varying upper size cutoff @xmath3 . with this assumption , the study of the evolution of solids in the disk can be reduced to a small set of one - dimensional partial differential equations for the maximum particle size @xmath4 , the total surface density of gas @xmath5 , as well as the total surface density of solids and vapor for each species considered ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the index referencing the species ) .",
    "here @xmath9 is the radial distance from the central star and @xmath10 is time .",
    "this idea is to be considered as an alternative approach to the work of ciesla & cuzzi ( 2006 ) for instance , who equivalently model the evolution of gas and solids in the disk over the course of several myr , simplifying the collision / shattering balance by considering only four `` size '' bins ( vapor , grains , rapidly drifting `` migrators '' and finally very large planetesimals ) .",
    "the derivation of the model is presented in complete detail in  [ sec : model ] ( the result - minded reader may prefer to jump straight to  [ sec : fiducial ] and  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the standard gas dynamics equations together with the photo - evaporation model used are well - known , and summarized for completeness in  [ subsec : modelgas ] and  [ subsec : modelvap ] .",

    "[ subsec : sizefunc ] .",
    "the stochastic motion of solids in the nebula resulting from frictional coupling with turbulent eddies and from mutual gravitational encounter have been studied by many others before .",

    "[ subsec : motion ] , and later used in ",
    "[ subsec : growth ] and  [ subsec : sigmapevol ] to derive new equations for the growth of grains into planetesimals , as well as the evolution of the total surface density of particles . finally ,  [ subsec : sublim ] summarizes the very simple sublimation / condensation model used here .    a general overview of the typical inputs and outputs of the numerical model are given in  [ sec : fiducial ] and  [ sec : results ] respectively . in order to gain a better understanding of the numerical results ,  5 presents existing and new analytical work characterizing the global features of the model ( gas dynamics in  [ subsec : mathgas ] , grain growth in  [ subsec : mathgrow ] , evolution of solids in  [ subsec : mathsolids ] ,  5.4 and  5.5 ) .",
    "in particular , a plausible new semi - analytical evolution equation for the total mass of solids in the disk is presented in ",
    "[ subsubsec : totalmassp ] , which depends only on the initial conditions of the disk .",
    "finally , the model and results are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "although this paper focuses primarily on presenting the methods used ( while paper ii discusses the observable properties of the modeled disks ) , i give some estimates for the heavy - element retention efficiency of disks as a function of the model parameters , and show how one could reconcile the high diversity of observed disk properties with the low dispersion in metallicities for star within the same cluster ( wilden _ et al .",
    "conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in all that follows , i assume that the gas disk evolves independently of the solids .",
    "note that this is only true as long as the surface density of the gas is much larger than the surface density of solids ; when the metallicity @xmath11 approaches or exceeds unity , solids begin to influence the evolution of the gas through angular momentum exchange and possible gravitational instabilities . barring these cases ,",

    "although the numerical algorithm i have developed can be used with any input for @xmath26 and @xmath29 , this particular value of @xmath26 is preferred as it greatly simplifies the analytical interpretation of the numerical results ; indeed , in this case @xmath16 scales linearly with radius , a feature which turns out to be particularly useful .",

    "sublimation and condensation are assumed to be instantaneous on the timescales considered and are calculated as a separate numerical step ( see  [ subsec : sublim ] ) .",
    "collisional encounters between solid particles can result in their coagulation or mutual shattering , the latter sometimes followed by the re - accretion of material onto the largest remaining fragments .",
    "however complex the mechanisms considered are , the size distribution function of the particles is naturally expected to relax to a quasi - steady equilibrium power - law within a few collision times .",
    "theoretical arguments on the steady - state nature of the collisional cascade imply that the power - law index depends on the relationship between the relative velocities of the objects and their material strengths ( obrien & greenberg , 2003 ) .",
    "such power - laws are observed in the ism ( with index -3.5 , mathis , rumpl & nordsieck , 1977 ) , for kuiper - belt objects ( with varying index depending on the size range ) and for asteroid - belt objects .",

    "motion of particles within the disk can be induced by various possible forces : brownian motion , motion induced by frictional drag with the gas and motion induced by interactions with the gravitational potential of the central star or that of other large planetesimals .",
    "the dominant term depends on the particle size .    since the only particles considered here have size @xmath3 , brownian motion is typically negligible .",
    "in a turbulent nebula , particles of various sizes couple via gas drag to the turbulent eddies and can acquire significant velocities when their typical stopping time is comparable with the eddy turnover time .",
    "larger particles are only weakly coupled with the gas but undergo significant gravitational interactions with each other which constantly excite their eccentricities and inclinations .",

    "this is the main difference between this model and a single - size particle model ; it accounts for the fact that even when @xmath163 , a significant fraction of the collisional encounters are destructive and result in the erosion of the larger bodies into smaller rapidly drifting particles with @xmath197 .",
    "the sign of @xmath192 determines whether grains are transported inward or outward . as expected from equation ( [ eq : ugasapprox ] ) the gas velocity changes sign at @xmath198 .",
    "this critical radius grows linearly with @xmath199 ( defined in equation ( [ eq : approxsigma ] ) ) , and therefore sweeps outward roughly on the viscous timescale @xmath200 . as a result for @xmath201",
    "the particle velocity is necessarily negative , while for @xmath202 particles can be entrained outward provided they are strongly coupled with the gas . since @xmath203 is typically much larger that @xmath204 , all the particles outward of @xmath203 are particles of size @xmath183 .",
    "combining these facts implies that there exists a reservoir of small particles at large radii , slowly eroded by the outward motion of @xmath198 .",
    "in addition , as the gas density drops , the small particles gradually decouple from the gas implying that the reservoir begins to `` leak '' . eventually , even the smallest particles decouple from the gas , and all the solids come rushing inward .",

    "the timescale @xmath209 for the release of the particle reservoir is clearly much shorter for the larger particles ( 0.84myr for 10@xmath167m - size particles instead of 2.33myr for @xmath167m - size particles ) .",
    "in fact , this timescale can easily be estimated by solving simultaneously the equations @xmath210 and @xmath211 . assuming that @xmath5 is equal to the self - similar solution , and that the particles in that regime satisfy @xmath161 ( which was checked numerically ) , @xmath212 .",

    "the radius of the reservoir at release is found to be @xmath221 ; checking this solution against the numerical runs also reveals excellent agreement .",
    "since particles in the inner disk can achieve significant sizes , the drift timescale of grains within @xmath198 is usually much smaller than the viscous accretion timescale and/or the age of the disk .",
    "this can be readily seen in figure [ fig : velocities ] .",
    "this very simple fact has important consequences : it implies that the distribution of solids in the inner disk is uniquely controlled by the mass flux leaking from the reservoir .",
    "one way to see this is to look at the particle disk evolution timescale @xmath222 obtained by numerical integration of the fiducial model .",
    "figure [ fig : taup ] shows results for the three different initial particle sizes considered in the previous section ( as solid lines ) .",

    "are very well represented , while the fit at later times ( for @xmath241 ) , in particular for the smaller particle sizes , is slightly poorer 6myr , which introduce some non - self - similar effects in the solution . ] .",
    "integrating equation ( [ eq : dmpdt ] ) yields an estimate for the total particle disk mass as a function of time , which is compared with the results of the numerical simulations in figure [ fig : taup]b .",
    "the approximate solutions follow the trend of the exact solutions well , with some small acceptable systematic deviations at early times ( see below ) . in particular",
    ", it reproduces well the very rapid decrease in the particle disk mass as the reservoir is finally released ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "a very important consequence of the `` leaky reservoir '' model is that the total disk mass is reasonably independent of the physical phenomena taking place in the inner disk ( provided the bulk drift timescale of the particles is smaller than the viscous accretion timescale ) .",
    "this implies that the evolution of the _ total _ disk mass depends very weakly on the particle growth rate ( and in particular of the sticking efficiency @xmath107 ) , and of sublimation or condensation fronts .",
    "this can actually be seen in figure [ fig : taup ] , which shows the numerical solution for the fiducial model with sublimation / condensation in addition to the three curves discussed earlier .",
    "the disk mass in the fiducial model is practically indistinguishable from that of the disk without sublimation / condensation ( for the micron - size particles ) .",
    "finally , note that the proposed evolution equation for @xmath242 breaks down if the bulk drift timescale of the particles is comparable to or larger than the viscous accretion timescale or the age of the disk ( whichever is smaller ) . for instance , if the particles remain small at all times , then they naturally follow the evolution of the gas at all times ( which explains the results of aa07 ) . as an other example , one can see in figure [ fig : taup ] when @xmath243 that there is a very small difference between the fiducial model with sublimation / condensation lines and the model without .",
    "this arises because at early times , the drift timescale of the particles is much smaller than the age of the disk and the solid mass content has not yet had time to equilibrate . as a result",
    ", most of the solid mass in the inner disk rapidly drifts toward the central star . in the absence of sublimation lines all of this mass",
    "is lost , whereas a significant fraction of it can get trapped by the sublimation lines if sublimation / condensation is taken into account ( see  [ subsec : effsublim ] ) .",
    "having characterized the global evolution of the total disk mass in solids ( which was shown to depend only on the initial grain size @xmath183 and on the viscous diffusion time @xmath200 ) , one could hope to describe the evolution of the surface density of grains as well . as mentioned earlier",
    ", when the surface density of grains within the disk is controlled by the mass flux coming from the reservoir one can expect that @xmath244 where @xmath245 is given by equation ( [ eq : dmpdt ] ) .",
    "this approximation turns out to be quite good ( except outside of @xmath198 of course ) .",
    "unfortunately , the problem lies elsewhere : even though @xmath245 is known , it is particularly difficult to estimate @xmath246 since it depends on @xmath4 and @xmath5 : the analytical estimate of @xmath4 given in equation ( [ eq : approxsmax ] ) is unfortunately not valid in regions i and most of region ii beyond a few times @xmath1 yr and the self - similar solution for @xmath5 is also invalid for @xmath247 in the same regions . using these estimates despite their poor quality yield predictions that are off by up to an order of magnitude ( see appendix c ) .",
    "note that if all that is needed is a `` quick and dirty '' order of magnitude estimate then the procedure described in the appendix could be considered satisfactory . in particular , it does reproduce well the particle surface density dip observed in the intermediate disk regions , a feature which could be used together with spatially resolved disk observations to constrain the value of the sticking efficiency @xmath107 .",
    "the study of the evolution of solids after the gap opening phase was the main purpose of the work of aa07 .",
    "when growth is ignored , aa07 showed that the evolution of the surface density of solids follows that of the gas ( for small particles ) .    after the formation of the gap , both gas and solids within quickly accrete into the central star on the clearing timescale , leaving a hole clear of both dust and gas .",
    "near the edge of the hole thus formed , an inversion in radial pressure gradient causes the particles to drift outward instead of inward . as the hole grows all of the grains outside of @xmath248",
    "are slowly shepherded outward with it . as a result of these processes ,",
    "most of the solid mass at the time of gap opening is retained in the disk but moved to larger and larger radii .    when grain growth is taken into account on the other hand , a different picture emerges .",
    "the particles within the initial gap radius have typically grown to embryo sizes , so that their stokes number is well above unity by the time the gap opens .",
    "the reduction in the surface density of the gas does not affect their drift velocity much ( which is exactly the opposite case to the aa07 model ) and they stay in place while the gas within the gap accretes .",
    "the `` hole '' thus created still contains a significant amount of solid material .",
    "as direct photo - evaporation takes over , the hole in the gas widens as expected but the corresponding reverse radial pressure gradient has very little effect on the large particles . as a result",
    ", one observes a significant amount of solid material remaining in the inner disk all the way out to about 10 au ( in the case of the fiducial model ) .",
    "eventually , the edge of the hole retreats out to regions where the particle stokes number is of order unity , at which point the clearing begins as in the aa07 model .",
    "as already suggested by aa07 , all particles smaller than 1 - 10 cm are entrained to large radii , while all particles larger than this particular size remain behind .",
    "the prediction for the particle size given in equation ( [ eq : approxsmax ] ) can be used to estimate the radius outside of which particles are entrained , by setting the age of the disk to be @xmath249 : let @xmath250 the innermost extent of the cleared region , so that @xmath251^{1/3 } { \\rm au } \\label{eq : rinner}\\ ] ] which yields a prediction of @xmath252 au for the fiducial model .",
    "this value is larger than that observed in figure [ fig : fiducialsd ] by a factor of about @xmath253 , which can be attributed to the fact that the estimated particle size at this point is a factor of 10 too large compared with the true numerical simulations ( see figure [ fig : fiducialsmax ] ) .",
    "however , the estimate in equation ( [ eq : rinner ] ) can be thought of as a solid upper limit for the radial extent of the remaining solid material in the inner regions of the disk after the clearing of the gas .",
    "material outside of @xmath250 is shepherded outward with the retreating hole . as more and more material",
    "is swept and entrained outward , a strongly localized surface density peak appears , which eventually grows to be a large as the local surface density of the gas .",
    "when this happens , two situations could occur within similar outcomes : either gravitational instabilities set in , resulting in the in - situ formation of a planet , or the frictional drag between the particles and the gas begins to influence the evolution of the gas itself , and the particles stop moving outward ( neither effects are included in the numerical model , and therefore can not be seen in the simulations ) .",
    "this effect is difficult to quantify in the general case , since neither @xmath102 nor @xmath30 are known analytically at this stage of the disk evolution . in the fiducial model show in figure [ fig : fiducialsd ] , this occurs at about 200au .",
    "this process could lead to the systematic formation of localized debris rings reasonably far from the central star ( from a few tens to a few hundreds of au ) , without any need for prior planet formation or other clumping mechanism .",
    "such debris rings are commonly observed , or inferred from the dust dustribution ( see for instance schneider _",
    "_ 2006 for direct detections , and strubbe & chiang 2006 for inference from spatial dust distribution ) .    as in the aa07 model ,",
    "most of the solid content present in the disk at @xmath249 remains in the disk after complete clearing of the gas .",
    "the fraction of solid material moved to large radii depends on the details of the surface density distribution of particles at @xmath254 ( which is not well - known a priori ) , but is typically of the order of 80%-90% of the total mass of solids ; the remaining fraction can be found in the inner disk .      the role of sublimation lines on the local accumulation and growth of particles has already been shown and discussed by others ( stepinski & valageas , 1997 ; ciesla & cuzzi , 2006 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the idea is that particles composed mainly of a given chemical species drift inward until they reach the sublimation line where they are transformed into vapor .",
    "the vapor diffuses inward much more slowly than the rate of migration of the incoming solids , leading to a large enhancement of the local metallicity . through turbulent diffusion ,",
    "a fraction of the vapor content actually finds it way back through the sublimation line and recondenses .",
    "the typical width of the region where this effect dominates can be evaluated from a local diffusive lengthscale , and naturally scales as @xmath27 .",
    "the exact amount of material accumulating in the region is more difficult to estimate a priori , since it depends on the difference between the solid mass flux into the sublimation line and the vapor mass flux out of the sublimation line .",
    "however , for most of the lifetime of the disk the flux of both solid and gaseous material is controlled by the reservoir at large radii so that the solid mass flux is equal to @xmath255 , which is also roughly equal to the mass flux of vapor out of the sublimation zone .",
    "this explains why the relative strength of the surface density peaks compared with the background curve fails to grow with time after the initial adjustment period , which would necessarily occur otherwise .",
    "the conclusion is that any local surface density enhancement , and associated localized peak in the particle size is created very early in the lifetime of the disk ( this is indeed seen in figure [ fig : fiducialsmax]b )  but it is only later , when the gas surface density decays and the metallicity increases , that gravitational instabilities in the particle layer could set in to trigger the planetary formation process .",
    "this picture , should it be correct , also implies that the relative heights of the peaks determines a strict sequence of `` alarm clocks '' on planetary formation timescales .",
    "note that only three species have been selected in the fiducial model .",
    "clearly , there will be as many surface density and particle size peaks as the number of separate sublimation temperatures .",
    "also , in this particular model the background temperature of the disk is fixed . in reality , the disk temperature cools significantly as @xmath256 decreases , resulting in the inward migration of the various sublimation lines ( see garaud & lin 2007 , for instance ) .",
    "this will also affect the shape of the surface density profile in the inner disk ; feedback between the disk temperature profile and the evolution of the surface density of grains will be the subject of future work .",
    "the fundamental assumption underlying this work is that of the maintenance of a power - law particle size distribution function at all radii , throughout the disk lifetime .",
    "the assumption is justified exactly only if the collisional timescale ( note : _ not _ the growth timescale , which is naturally a factor of @xmath257 larger ) is shorter than the drift timescale for each size - bin .",
    "whether this is in fact exactly true is certainly unlikely , but neither is it particularly relevant .",
    "the correct questions that should be asked are : ( i ) _ how far _ from equation ( [ eq : dnds ] ) is the true size - distribution function in a disk , and ( ii ) how do deviations from ( [ eq : dnds ] ) impact the conclusions from this paper ?",
    "question ( i ) is a fundamental question , with implications reaching far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "attempts at answering it have come from various angles including both direct observations ( in disks , but also in molecular clouds , in the ism , as well as in our own solar system ) and numerical experiments . as mentioned in  [ subsec : sizefunc ] ,",
    "the observational evidence and theoretical motivation for a power - law size - distribution function is strong but limited to more - or - less spatially isotropic and homogeneous cases where there exist no systematic size - dependent drift or settling velocity which could act as a size - filter .",
    "numerical simulations of the coagulation - shattering balance in similar conditions also unanimously agree on the power - law distribution , with indices varying slightly depending on the model assumptions but never straying too far from -3.5 .",
    "unfortunately , there has only been one study ( suttner & yorke 2001 ) that self - consistently includes a complete parameterization of the coagulation / shattering balance together with radial drift and vertical settling of the particles in an accretion disk .",
    "suttner & yorke ( 2001 ) studied the formation of a protostellar accretion disk through the collapse of a uniformly rotating molecular cloud core , and closely followed the evolution of the grain size distribution function at every spatial position throughout the collapse phase ( first 10,000 years ) .",
    "they found that accretion shocks play an important role in limiting the growth of the grains ; they also found , as expected , that the assumed sticking efficiency essentially governs the maximum grain size achievable .",
    "the dust size distribution functions computed vary strongly with height above the disk : they show clear evidence that larger grains tend to be found in the mid - plane , while regions high above the mid - plane remain close to the mrn - derived initial conditions .",
    "this can be attributed to a combination of settling of the larger grains as well as preferential in - situ growth .",
    "the mid - plane regions in their simulations appear to be largely depleted of small grains , which would be evidence for strong deviations from the power - law structure i assume .",
    "however , one may wonder whether this depletion is indeed true in a real disk , since suttner & yorke neglect diffusion of the smallest grains by the gas turbulence ( which could easily bring small grains back towards the mid - plane from higher regions of the disk ) .    in conclusion",
    ", one should bear in mind that the assumption made in selecting a power - law size distribution function is probably not always strictly justified ( in particular for larger particles ) . but given the enormous computational advantage of this approach , it should be thought of as an acceptable trade - off between models in which the full coagulation / shattering equation is solved , and models in which only one particle size ( or a few particle sizes ) are considered .    question ( ii ) can easily be answered by identifying where in the proposed model the assumption of a power - law size - distribution function is used .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ subsec : growth ] , the minimum particle size @xmath258 plays _ no _ role in the dynamical evolution of the solids in the disks , as long as @xmath259 , which is the case for the mrn size - distribution function , and therefore likely to continue being the case throughout the disk evolution .",
    "thus whether the smallest grains are slightly depleted or not compared with the proposed power - law distribution function really does not matter .",
    "collisional growth is essentially dominated by encounters between particles of similar sizes : even if collisions with smaller particles are more frequent , the mass gained is much smaller .",
    "this is easily seen mathematically in the derivation of the growth rates @xmath260 in  [ subsec : growth ] , where the integral over all possible impactor sizes is always dominated by the largest particles , except possibly when @xmath163 , in which case the integral is dominated by particles of intermediate size .",
    "another way of seeing this is that while the assumptions concerning the grain size distribution function used to derive equation [ eq : groturb ] are very different from those of stepinski & valageas ( 1997 ) who assume that the distribution function is strongly peaked around a single - size , the outcome is the same whithin some factors of order unity .",
    "the systematic radial motion of decoupled particles ( @xmath163 ) is the only place where the assumption made has a significant effect on the model results . if one assumes that all particles have a single size @xmath3 , then @xmath261 while if one considers the mass - weighted average motion of all particles following the proposed size - distribution function ( [ eq : dnds ] ) then @xmath262 which can be significantly larger . as mentioned earlier , this accounts for the fact that when a continuum of particle sizes is taken into account , intermediate - size grains ( with @xmath263 ) do rapidly drift leading to a non - neligible mass flux , even if the largest ones are fully decoupled ,    the scaling @xmath262 clearly depends on @xmath264 ; whether this exact scaling really applies to disks certainly is debatable , but i would argue that the general picture of large bodies being eroded by collisions and leading to a non - negligible mass - flux even when the larger bodies themselves do not drift has to hold .",
    "the only caveat is that the collision rate becomes null when the bodies reached isolation mass ; thus one should , for self - consistency , set @xmath265 in this limit , which was not done here ( otherwise , smaller particles coming from larger radii artificially accumulate in the inner regions ) .",
    "a way forward would be to combine the model proposed here with an n - body code , in which particles are treated using a size - distribution until they reach embryo size , then taken out of the distribution and individually followed using n - body simulations",
    ". this could be the subject of future work .      the simple equation for the evolution of the total mass of solids ( [ eq : dmpdt ] )",
    "can be used to derive the final contents of the disk after complete gas dispersal when caused by photo - evaporation from the central star .",
    "if grains in the outer disk remain fully coupled to the gas throughout the lifetime of the disk ( i.e. if @xmath266 , or equivalently , @xmath267 m ) then the amount of material left after complete dispersal of the gas can easily be estimated by the amount of solids left at @xmath268 ( see aa07 ) .",
    "therefore an order of magnitude estimate for the heavy - element retention efficiency is simply @xmath269 where @xmath270 . for a fixed initial disk mass ,",
    "this estimate depends weakly on @xmath215 ; this could explain the very low dispersion observed in the heavy element retention efficiency of evolved systems ( wilden _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) despite the vastly different disks dispersal timescale required by sed observations .    to refine this estimate and quantify the effect of the initial grain size distribution on the heavy - element retention efficiency ,",
    "i integrate ( [ eq : dmpdt ] ) from @xmath271 to @xmath249 for a wide variety of initial conditions ( @xmath272 , @xmath215 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : retention ] .",
    "four cases are considered , with varying initial particle size @xmath183 and turbulent @xmath0 .",
    "the weak dependence on the initial conditions of the disk ( @xmath272 , @xmath215 ) for given values of @xmath0 and @xmath183 suggested by equation ( [ eq : zleft1 ] ) is naturally still present : it appears that even with @xmath272 and @xmath215 varying by two orders of magnitude , the remaining amount of solids does not vary more a factor of a few . in the fiducial model for instance ( @xmath273 m and @xmath274 ) the typical amount of solids left is of the order of a few earth masses for most plausible values of @xmath272 and @xmath215 .    as suggested by the results of  [ subsubsec : totalmassp ] , the retention efficiency drops dramatically for larger initial grain sizes , but naturally saturates near the value given by equation ( [ eq : zleft1 ] ) for very small grain sizes ( e.g. compare the results for @xmath275 m with the results for @xmath276 m ) . also suggested by ( [ eq : zleft1 ] )",
    "is the dependence of the phenomena on @xmath0 : for the smaller value of @xmath277 , one could expect up to a few tens of earth masses to be left behind in the disk , a value that begins to be consistent with the amount of solids left in the minimum solar nebula model augmented with the mass of the oort cloud .",
    "thus it appears that consistency of this idea with our own solar system would strongly favour a model with @xmath183 is no larger than @xmath206 m , and @xmath0 is preferably of the order of 0.001 .",
    "how reliable is this estimate given the simplifications made in the model ? conveniently , given that the total disk mass resides mostly in the outer disk , and that the amount of material remaining in the inner disk is ultimately controlled by the mass flux from the outer reservoir , the mass estimates given here are reasonably independent of the physics of the inner disk ( including sublimation / condensation , but also dead zones , etc .. ) .",
    "there is however an important caveat ; as mentioned earlier , large protoplanetary embryos which have reached isolation mass are fully decoupled from the disk dynamics ( both in terms of their drift velocity and in terms of their collision frequency ) , and are not well - modeled by the size distribution function proposed .",
    "the mass contained in these embryos could add a few earth masses to what is presently estimated , but only in the inner disk .",
    "the total mass of solids which ends up being shepherded out to the outer solar system is not affected by this problem , and is therefore reliably estimated by this method .",
    "this paper presents a new algorithm modeling the evolution of gas and solids in protostellar , as well as some reliable quantitative analytical estimates for the outcome of the numerical simulations .",
    "the global disk evolution paradigm is well - reproduced by the numerical solutions .",
    "well - known results are recovered , such as the two - timescale gas evolution ( clarke , sotomayor & gendrin 2001 ; alexander , clarke & pringle 2006a ) , the rapid growth of solids in the inner disk ( suttner & yorke , 2001 , stepinski & valageas , 1997 , dullemond & dominik , 2005 ) , the shepherding of smaller particles by the retreating hole front ( alexander & armitage 2007 ) , and the accumulation of material near the sublimation lines ( stevenson & lunine , 1988 , stepinski & valageas 1997 , ciesla & cuzzi , 2006 ) .",
    "novel conclusions of this paper are :    \\(i ) the evolution of the mass of solids in the disk is essentially controlled by a reservoir of small grains at large radii .",
    "a well - tested empirical formula for the total solid mass in the disk is given in equation ( [ eq : dmpdt ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the heavy - element retention efficiency after gas dispersal is controlled by the remaining amount of solids left at the time of gap opening , and is found to vary weakly with initial disk conditions but _ very sensitively _ with initial particle size @xmath183 .",
    "the remaining amount of solids in the minimum solar nebula combined with the mass of the oort cloud is inconsistent with @xmath183 greater than 1@xmath167 m , and would tend to prefer a value of @xmath278 .",
    "\\(iii ) the strong dependence of the gas dispersal timescale on the initial mass and radius of the disk combined with the weak dependence of the heavy element retention efficiency on the same parameters could simultaneously explain the wide diversity of the sed observations with the very low dispersion of the stellar metallicities observed in the pleiades ( wilden _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) .",
    "\\(iv ) rapid grain growth in the inner disk implies that solids in the form of large planetesimals ( with sizes ranging from a few meters to 1000 km ) are locally retained after gas dispersal .",
    "the presence of a population of large planetesimals in the inner regions of debris disks has been inferred from interferometric observations of the presence of dust despite its very short radiation blowout time ( specifically in tw hya , by eisner , chiang & hillenbrand 2006 )    \\(v ) all the small grains are swept by the retreating gas front at the edge of the hole and shepeherded outward .",
    "when the accumulated surface density of grains approaches that of the gas , the gas becomes unable to continue moving the grains and will most likely leave them behind .",
    "this could explain the systematic formation of narrow dust rings at large radii .",
    "\\(vi ) regulation of the solid mass flux by the `` leaky reservoir '' implies that any local surface density enhancement ( or `` peaks '' ) near sublimation lines must be accumulated very early on in the disk lifetime , more precisely during the initial phase when the disk dynamics are still out of equilibrium ( @xmath279 first 10,000 - 100,000 yr ) .",
    "the gradual decay of the inner disk gas density through photo - evaporation could then trigger gravitational instabilities at well - separated times as each peak respectively approaches unit metallicity .",
    "\\(vii ) possible constraints on the sticking efficiency of particles in the turbulent conditions found in protostellar disks could be derived from spatially resolved observations of the grain surface density of nearby disks ( see appendix c )",

    "<S> i show that the global evolution of solids is controlled by a leaky reservoir of small grains at large radii , and propose an empirically derived evolution equation for the total mass of solids , which can be used to estimate the total heavy element retention efficiency in the planet formation paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> consistency with observation of the total mass of solids in the minimum solar nebula augmented with the mass of the oort cloud sets strong upper limit on the initial grain size distribution , as well as on the turbulent parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> detailed comparisons with sed observations are presented in a following paper . </S>"
