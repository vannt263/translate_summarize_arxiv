    "recall , however , that even when the fundamental group of the gsm is non - abelian we do not consider the crossing of defect lines and the unlinking of linked loops .",

    "consider fig .",
    "3 ; in the neighborhood of @xmath71 , the singularity , we have the topology of a @xmath62 disclination .",
    "does @xmath54 have a zero ?",
    "yes ! to see this , note that @xmath54 must point along @xmath51 on two lines that emanate from @xmath71 and go off to left and right infinity .",
    "since it diverges at @xmath71 , at a point close enough to the left of a positive dislocation @xmath54 is arbitarily large and negative while at left infinity @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that somewhere along the line going to left infinity @xmath54 must vanish  the @xmath66 disclination .",
    "the saddle point is at the intersection of two asymptotic lines that all have the same value of @xmath33 or , equivalently , four rays emanating from it .",
    "the long distance structure of the dislocation has three rays going off to infinity , one of them arising from the extra ( or missing , depending on whether you are an optimistic or a pessimist ) layer .",

    "[ fig : hd ] .",
    "to put the previous discussion into perspective , consider the canonical example of a screw dislocation @xmath79 we immediately see that it does not have any component that cancels off the background @xmath78 and therefore it does not decompose into two disclinations .",
    "what about dislocations with a mixed edge / screw character ?",
    "let the tangent vector of the dislocation at some point be @xmath80 . if we take a plane perpendicular to @xmath80 then , as long as @xmath80 is not parallel to @xmath51 the intersection of the smectic field with the plane shares the same topology as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd ] .",
    "the hyperbolic point is no longer a location where @xmath81 since @xmath54 will have components out of the plane .",

    "then @xmath84 vanishes somewhere by the same argument as before . note from simple geometry that the magnitude of @xmath84 at infinity gets smaller as the angle of @xmath80 with the @xmath51 axis decreases and the saddle moves farther and farther away from the dislocation : this is why @xmath85 can not be parallel to @xmath51 - the saddle moves off to infinity as in the case of the pure screw dislocation line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : screw ] ) .",
    "depending on the limit , however , it can escape out to infinity in any direction .",
    "if we put the smectic in , for instance , a cylinder @xmath86 then we have an ambiguity arising from the changing boundary condition on the cylinder at infinity .",
    "finally , note that in the presence of other dislocations it is possible for the argument predicting hyperbolic points to fail ; zeroes of @xmath54 are not conserved , only singularities are .",
    "the hyperbolic point associated with any particular dislocation may disappear into the other dislocation .",
    "however , by increasing @xmath47 through our smooth set of smectics we can , as we argued , isolate the zero arbitrarily close to the dislocation .",
    "so we see that a screw dislocation is different from an edge  it has no hyperbolic point .",
    "can we make this more precise ?",
    "note that we are required to specify a fixed sample topology with boundary conditions in order to solve the euler - lagrange equations , for instance .",
    "if we take a finite sample with fixed boundary conditions @xmath87 then we can add the point at infinity and consider the problem on @xmath39 .",
    "however , even this is problematic from the point of view of @xmath33  there is a defect at infinity , with the topology of an electric dipole in @xmath54 .",
    "one might recall that morse theory forbids such structures @xcite in a smectic .",
    "it is instructive ( and easier to visualize ) to consider the situation for a two - dimensional smectic .",
    "suppose we want to have a defect free smectic on @xmath88 ; there are an infinite number of layers and there is some equally - spaced ground state at infinity , a simple periodic structure .",
    "if we want to compactify this to @xmath89 then we must squeeze all the layers together at infinity or , in other words , on the sphere we want to have a set of non - crossing layers except , perhaps at infinity , the north pole .",
    "the euler character of the sphere being two implies that there must be a @xmath90 winding defect at infinity . in one dimension up",
    "the euler character of the sphere is zero and this implies that @xmath54 must be wrapped up at the north pole in a defect with index zero .",
    "a direct calculation shows that this is what happens with the `` electric dipole '' texture .",
    "because of this complication we will restrict ourselves to finite regions @xmath91 with the rigid boundary condition @xmath92 .",
    "note that the euler - lagrange equations that follow from minimizing the free energy are _ fourth_-order requiring three boundary conditions .",
    "this boundary condition supplies three as do the windings around each defect  the phase change and the planes in which the phase changes . as a consequence of the rigid boundary conditions on @xmath93 it is impossible for a hyperbolic point in a plane _ not perpendicular _ to @xmath51 to pass through the boundary :",
    "if the plane is normal to @xmath94 then at the hyperbolic point , @xmath95 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath96 then the argument above shows that the hyperbolic point is not required and there is no obstruction at @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that a piece of edge dislocation _ can not _ be twisted into a screw dislocation while maintaining the boundary conditions .",

    "_ in a finite sample this is a difference between a edge - like and screw - like dislocation .",
    "the former have their hyperbolic points inside the sample , the latter outside .",
    "if we think of the divergence - hyperbolic point pair as the generalization of the core of the pure edge defect , then screw - like dislocations have cores that are larger than the sample !",
    "this is the physical difference between the two types of defect ",
    "localized versus delocalized cores . for an edge defect to become a screw defect ( or _ vice",
    "versa _ ) , we must relax the boundary conditions to let the hyperbolic point through .",
    "we will call a dislocation with no pure ( 100% ) screw component a `` some - edge '' defect since all parts of it have some edge component . since we are considering only ambient isotopy of the dislocations",
    ", we may keep them all at a minimum distance from each other and thus we conjecture ( in _ lieu _ of a proof ) that the hyperbolic points can not swap among dislocations .",
    "a consequence of this is a topological conservation law ; a defect loop with no screw component is topologically tethered to the other defects that it links .",
    "because every point on the dislocation has a unique partner hyperbolic point , we can assign a value of @xmath33 to each point on the singularity .",
    "this is not possible in a superfluid since there is no general way to assign a value of the phase on a vortex  all values of the phase exist on the singularity .",

    "one might think that a closed vortex line would accumulate the winding imposed by the vortices it surrounds .",
    "however , if we try to measure the winding on the vortex we run into a problem  the value of the phase is , by definition , undefined on the defect .",
    "we could frame the vortex loop , but there is no well - defined way to do this .",
    "we could , for instance , push off the vortex line along a direction of some fixed value of @xmath33 . but how far ?",
    "two different experiments could get two different answers by pushing off different distances .",
    "an unambiguous approach that preserves the helicity is described by moffat and ricca @xcite . there",
    "they replace each vortex line with a vortex ribbon of fixed width , introducing at the outset a preferred framing .",
    "this geometric replacement of the lines leads to a truly conserved helicity ( in ambient isotopy of the _ ribbons _ ) when clugreanu s theorem relating twist , writhe , and link @xcite is included in the analysis .",

    "some - edge dislocations have a different framing allowing us to define a different invariant that comes from the phase field itself .",
    "we define @xmath76 on the dislocation @xmath53 as the value of @xmath33 on the corresponding hyperbolic point .",
    "the change in phase integrated around @xmath53 must be a multiple of @xmath74 : @xmath100 an interpretation of @xmath76 is possible in the smectic case that fails in the superfluid situation : @xmath76 is the value of the level set at the boundary that comes into the sample and joins the edge dislocation at that point .",
    "it is only because the value of @xmath33 grows linearly ( in the @xmath51 direction ) on the boundary that we can make this identification .",
    "thus , despite the fact that @xmath33 is not defined on the dislocation there is still a special value of @xmath33 associated with a boundary condition . for each value of @xmath101",

    "the two colors are apparently @xmath105 apart in hue . however , when we rotate to @xmath106 the left and right colors change  these are coming from different values of @xmath76 on the boundary . similarly",
    "in the rightmost frame where we rotate by @xmath107 . each point on the edge loop has a different value of @xmath33 and , as we go around the screw defect the value of @xmath76 winds by @xmath74 .",

    ". were we to try to take the no boundary limit by using @xmath39 , then the phase slips as the hyperbolic point moves out to infinity and winds around the `` electric dipole '' defect at infinity .",
    "thus the separation of pure screw components from defect segments with some edge component is not only necessary from the point of view of the boundary conditions but it is essential for the conservation of this new linking invariant",

    "if we know @xmath123 for some choice of @xmath47 then @xmath124 .",
    "this allows us to define @xmath76 even when dislocations interfere , allowing us to assign a phase to the dislocation .",
    "for instance , we see that @xmath125 gives us zeroes at @xmath58 and @xmath126 . thus for any fixed @xmath116 we can always make @xmath47 large enough to resolve the zeroes .",
    "finally , for any @xmath127 the boundary conditions are unchanged ",
    "the winding is specified around the defects and @xmath128 on the boundary .",
    "so , if we start with an initial configuration of isolated defects then there is a minimum distance between them . by choosing large enough @xmath47 we can resolve all their hyperbolic points and assign the value of @xmath76 to the some - edge portions of a dislocation .",
    "the black line represents the core of a single line defect that has wrapped around a pure screw dislocation that sits vertically in front of the page , in grey .",
    "we now see that the lines of constant phase have an unremovable jog in them that can not be eliminated without introducing more defects that collapse the lines together .",
    "this is the tell - tale topological tether that can not be removed in the smectic . in a superfluid",
    "the different colored lines would wrap around and find each other since @xmath33 goes to a constant at the boundaries .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we finally return to the original question , `` do dislocation loops topologically link ? '' more precisely , `` under ambient isotopy does the tether between two crossing defects carry non - trivial topology ? '' yes ! as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tether ] the topology of the phase field is twisted between two parts of a dislocation line that has encircled a screw defect ( sitting vertically above the plane of the page ) .",
    "because the colored lines all go off to the boundary on the right and left , the kink can not be undone without connecting and disconnecting some of the lines or , in other words , introducing more topological defects . but this could locally be the phase field of a superfluid , so is nt the superfluid tethered ?",
    "since the superfluid phase goes to a constant on the boundary , all of the constant-@xmath33 lines must loop around and end on themselves .",
    "consider , for instance , the violet line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tether ] that starts below the two dislocations on the left and ends above the two dislocations on the right . in the superfluid we can bring the violet end on the left into contact with the violet end on the right because we can always homotope the actual boundary condition into a _",
    "loop going around the whole sample .",
    "we can use this to unwind the violet phase line .",
    "the smectic , with its fixed winding on the boundary , can not participate in this homotopy .",
    "part of the restrictions of the previous sections can be removed just by introducing a little more machinery along the lines of the elegant work of dennis and hannay @xcite .",
    "the smectic offers us two different ways of framing a dislocation loop with everywhere nonvanishing edge component .",
    "consider a dislocation line @xmath130 and define the curve @xmath131 as the push off of @xmath130 along the layer @xmath132 ( we can , of course , make @xmath131 arbitrarily close to @xmath130 ) .",
    "let @xmath133 be the hyperbolic line associated with @xmath130 ( we can also make it arbitrarily close to @xmath131 by making @xmath134 .",
    "now , by calugareanu s formula @xcite , we have @xmath135 and @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the gauss linking number of the two curves @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 is the twist of the vector pointing from @xmath138 to @xmath139 around @xmath138 , and @xmath141 is the writhe of the curve @xmath130 , a geometric quantity .",
    "we can eliminate writhe to find @xmath142 .",
    "but consider the value of @xmath33 on the hyperbolic point .",
    "it winds _ precisely _ because the zero of the phase field twists about @xmath130 in response to the other dislocations it corrals . in the geometry we have",
    "so far considered , the hyperbolic line does not twist around @xmath130 .",
    "thus @xmath143 ( recall that twist has a denominator of @xmath74 by convention ) . therefore @xmath144 but now we see the problem : @xmath145 is robust while the two terms on the right hand side of ( [ ca ] ) are not",
    ". in particular , the linking of @xmath130 with @xmath133 requires @xmath133 to stay in a finite region .",
    "as we have argued , when a dislocation becomes too vertical , @xmath133 leaves the sample .",
    "when it comes back inside it can come back on the other `` side '' of @xmath130 and change @xmath146 .",
    "this will then require that @xmath129 compensate to keep the linking of @xmath130 with @xmath131 constant ! here again",
    ", we see the difficulty with pure screw components in the dislocation  it spoils the invariant along with the boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "this connection between the linking and @xmath129 gives us , however , another interpretation : consider a fibred knot @xmath31 , a knot that is the boundary of a continuum of non - intersecting , space - filling surfaces each labelled by an angle on @xmath147 .",
    "this implies an angle field @xmath148 defined everywhere but on @xmath31 .",
    "the smectic phase field @xmath149 can be constructed and can be fit to the required boundary conditions when @xmath31 is inside the sample . in the absence of any other defects we can choose , for instance , the seifert surface corresponding to the angle @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "if we intersect this surface with an @xmath152-tube around @xmath31 then we get the curve @xmath153 .",
    "since @xmath151 is oriented we can push @xmath153 off of @xmath151 along its normal vector and so @xmath153 _ does not _",
    "intersect @xmath151 .",
    "it follows that @xmath154 . thus if we have a knotted dislocation with no other defects present that also has a hyperbolic line everywhere ( _",
    "i.e. _ it always has enough edge component ) , @xmath155 , then @xmath156 note that although it is only necessary to have a seifert surface to generate @xmath153 , the requirement of no other defects can only be satisfied by a fibred knot  we need a phase field @xmath2 everywhere in space with nonvanishing @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that , once again @xcite , the standard homotopy theory treatment of topological defects fails for the smectic even in the case of pure dislocations .",
    "in addition , we have demonstrated a topological difference between the screw and edge dislocations that manifests itself geometrically  a pure edge always splits into a disclination dipole , while a defect with pure screw character does not .",
    "a mixed dislocation still has a hyperbolic point in the transverse plane and so is more like an edge than a screw . it is worth observing that the geometry around a dislocation with a hyperbolic point can not be a free disclination as it will not fit into ponaru s classification of two - dimensional critical points @xcite . in the case of a pure screw",
    ", however , those arguments do not apply and the dislocation can stand by itself , forcing the hyperbolic point off to infinity .",
    "all of these observations arise from the boundary condition that the layer normal points along a constant direction and the layers have equal spacing .",
    "this difference is what distinguishes the smectic from the superfluid where the phase field @xmath158 on the boundary .",
    "whether any progress can be made by studying the fundamental group of the jet bundle that ties together @xmath33 and @xmath54 @xcite is a question for further research .",
    "we also note that the description of crossed defects in crystals in terms of jogs and kinks @xcite might be described in a similar fashion , taking on a topological character .",
