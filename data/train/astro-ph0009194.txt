    "type i x  ray bursts ( for a review , see , e.g. , lewin et al . 1993 ) in the low mass x  ray binary ( lmxb ) 4u 172834 were discovered with the sas3 observatory in 1976 ( lewin 1976 ; hoffman et al .",
    "an extensive study of the burst properties of 96 bursts was done by basinska et al .",

    "( 1986 ) and day & tawara ( 1990 ) .",
    "the source has been classified by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) as an atoll source based on timing and spectral observations with the exosat satellite .",
    "the distance to the source is about 4 kpc ( van paradijs 1978 ; foster et al .",
    "1986 ; di salvo et al .",
    "no optical counterpart has been identified ( liller 1977 ) .",
    "after the launch of the rossi x  ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , burst oscillations on a millisecond time scale ( i.e. at 363 hz ) were first discovered in 4u 172834 by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "such oscillations have since been found in several other atoll sources , i.e. 4u 163653 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1998a , b ; strohmayer 1999 ; miller 1999 , 2000 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) , 4u 170243 ( strohmayer & markwardt 1999 ; markwardt et al .",
    "1999 ) , ks 1731260 ( morgan & smith 1996 ; smith et al . 1997 ; muno et al .",
    "2000 ) , mxb 174329 ( strohmayer et al . 1996b ; strohmayer et al . 1997 ) , aql x1 ( zhang et al . 1998 ; ford 1999 ; yu et al .",
    "1999 ) , and marginally in the rapid burster ( fox & lewin 1999 ) .",
    "the frequency during the burst usually increases to an asymptotic value which tends to be quite stable ( see for an overview strohmayer , swank , & zhang 1998 ) .",
    "this led to a simple model ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1997 ) in which the oscillations arise due to a hot spot in a layer that due to the burst has expanded in radius ( by 1030 m , this is not related to the expansion by several kilometers during classical radius expansion bursts ) and is therefore rotating slightly slower than the neutron star itself . as the layer recontracts the frequency increases towards the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "however , note that in 4u 163653 ( miller 1999 ; strohmayer 1999 ) and in ks 1731260 ( muno et al . 2000 ) decreases in frequency have also been seen . for 4u 172834 strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1998b ) found that for 3 bursts ( bursts 4 , 5 and 17 in this paper ) occurring more than 1.5 yr apart , the observed asymptotic oscillation periods were all close to 2.7476 ms and within 0.2 @xmath1 of each other .    for several atoll sources correlations",
    "have been found between timing properties and the position of the source in the x  ray color  color diagram ( e.g. , hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; prins & van der klis 1997 ; et al .",
    "1999 ; van straaten et al . 2000 ) .",
    "a correlation between the position of 4u 172834 in the color  color diagram and several power spectral features is shown in & van der klis ( 1999 ) and di salvo et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "the most obvious explanation for these correlations is that both the timing properties and the position in the color  color diagram track the changing mass accretion rate ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , from low in the so  called island state , and increasing along the banana branch ( for definitions see hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "a link between the position in the color  color diagram and burst spectral properties was found for 4u 163653 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1990 ) and 4u 170544 ( van der klis 1989 ) .    for ks 1731260 muno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) connected the position in the color  color diagram with both the x - ray spectral properties during the bursts and the presence of burst oscillations . in the island state ,",
    "ks 1731260 showed longer decay time scales , larger fluences , no evidence for radius expansion and no burst oscillations . on the banana branch ,",
    "the bursts were shorter , the fluences were smaller , and radius expansion episodes ( where the emitting region expands by a factor of 2.55.2 ) and burst oscillations were present .",
    "in this paper we present an overview of the spectral and burst  oscillation properties of 21 bursts in 4u 172834 .",
    "we particularly investigate the relation between oscillation characteristics and radius  expansion characteristics of the bursts .",
    "we also connect our results to the position of the source in the color - color diagram when the bursts took place .",
    "in this analysis we use data obtained with rxte s proportional counter array ( pca ; for more instrument information see zhang et al .",
    "1993 ) . to prevent break down events",
    "the voltage of the pca was lowered on three occasions leading to four periods of a different voltage , called gain epochs .",
    "we study bursts occurring in two rxte data sets .",
    "one set ( observation i d 10073 ) took place during gain _ epoch 1 _ ( before 1996 march 21 ) , and one ( observation i d 20083 ) during gain _ epoch 3 _ ( between 1996 april 15 and 1999 march 22 ) .",
    "we find a total number of 21 bursts . in the data we analyzed all 5 detectors of the pca",
    "were operational .",
    "all bursts are listed in table [ tbl : obs ] .",
    "the start times listed in table [ tbl : obs ] are the times that the rise in count rate , caused by the burst , triggered the experiment data system ( eds ) .",
    "we use the standard 2 mode , which has a 16s time  resolution and 129 energy channels , to analyze the spectral properties of 96 s of persistent emission just before each burst . to study the spectral properties during the bursts we use a burst trigger mode which has 64 energy channels and a time resolution of 8 ms .",
    "we determine a spectrum every 0.25 s. we correct each spectrum for background and dead  time using the methods supplied by the rxte team .",
    "we fit the spectra between 2.8 and 20 kev . for the fits",
    "we implement a systematic error of 1 % .",
    "we fix the hydrogen column density , @xmath2 , to the value of @xmath3 atoms @xmath4 ( hoffman et al .",
    "1976 ; grindlay & hertz 1981 ; foster et al . 1986 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "the spectra of the persistent emission were fit with an exponentially cut  off power law defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the photon energy , @xmath7 the power ",
    "law index , @xmath8 is the cut  off power law normalization , and @xmath9 is the cut  off energy . to this",
    "we add a gaussian line with a fixed width ( @xmath10 kev ) and energy ( 6.5 kev ) as observed previously ( see di salvo et al .",
    "this line could be due to iron emission .",
    "for the epoch 1 data eight spectra have a reduced chi squared , @xmath11/dof @xmath12 and four spectra ( the four with the lowest spectral index , all @xmath13 1 ) have a @xmath11/dof around 2.2 with 49 degrees of freedom .",
    "the fits are generally better for the data from epoch 3 ( @xmath11/dof @xmath14 with 42 degrees of freedom ) even for spectra as hard or harder than seen in epoch 1 , presumably due to better calibration in epoch 3 .    when we fit the burst spectra we model the total burst emission by a component equal to that of the persistent emission ( which is fixed during the burst ) plus a single blackbody component to describe the net burst emission . the bolometric blackbody flux , blackbody temperature , blackbody radius at 4.3 kpc ( see foster et al .",
    "1986 ) and @xmath11/dof of four representative bursts are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the fits generally have a @xmath11/dof below about 2 with 26 ( epoch 1 ) or 23 ( epoch 3 ) degrees of freedom , however sometimes it goes up to about 3 .",
    "we note that in some of the bursts that show radius expansion ( see below ) the @xmath11/dof peaks during the increase / decrease phase of the radius ( see e.g. bursts 21 and 9 in figure [ fig : spectra ] , this also occurs in bursts 1 , 2 , 711 and 20 ) .",
    "it seems that the spectra deviate from simple planckian functions when the radius varies rapidly ( see also lewin et al .",
    "we note that there are alternative methods ( sztajno et al .",
    "1986 ) to handle the spectral analysis during bursts .",
    "we picked the commonly used method described above as the aim of our paper is only to provide a homogeneous description of all burst properties for the purpose of correlating with the location in the color  color diagram ( see below ) , and not to do detailed spectral modelling .",
    "when a burst undergoes a radius expansion episode the luminosity @xmath15 stays constant and is equal to the eddington luminosity , @xmath16 ( modulo gravitational redshift effects with changing radius ) . because @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the radius of the photosphere and @xmath19 the effective temperature , when @xmath18 increases @xmath19 must decrease .",
    "bursts 1 , 2 , 712 , 20 and 21 clearly show this rise in blackbody radius and simultaneous dip in blackbody temperature .",
    "bursts 46 have a peak flux comparable to that of these radius expansion bursts ( see table [ tbl : spec ] ) , and therefore might be expected to show some evidence of radius expansion as well .",
    "indeed , burst 6 shows a clear bump in radius accompanied by a slight dip in temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) and bursts 4 and 5 only have one 0.25 s point were the radius peaked and the temperature dipped .",
    "because the effects are marginal , hereafter we shall count those bursts as having no radius expansion .",
    "bursts 1318 show a gradual increase in blackbody radius , for the entire duration of the burst , but no simultaneous decrease in blackbody temperature .",
    "this is not classical radius expansion , but might either be a real increase in the x - ray burning area ( see e.g. kong et al .",
    "2000 ) or it is a similar effect as that seen just after the radius contraction phase of bursts 812 ( see below ) .",
    "bursts 812 show an unexpected spectral behaviour ( see burst 9 in fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) . after the radius contraction phase the blackbody radius reaches a minimum value followed by an increase .",
    "this behaviour has previously been seen in bursts from several other sources ( e.g. hoffman et al .",
    "1980 ; tawara et al .",
    "1984 ; van paradijs et al . 1990",
    "; kaptein et al .",
    "2000 ) , although we note that the durations of those bursts were all long ( @xmath20 s ) .",
    "the behaviour could perhaps be due to a spectral hardening effect caused by electron scattering in the neutron star atmosphere , that depends mainly on the ratio @xmath21 ( see for a discussion kaptein et al .",
    "kaptein et al .",
    "( 2000 ) try to correct the temperature and radius for a burst in 1rxs j171824.2402934 and find that when corrected the increase in radius after the minimum is substantially less ( however , the effect does not disappear after correction ) .    from the spectral fits of the burst and the persistent emission we can determine the classical burst parameters such as the maximum flux ( bolometric black body flux plus the persistent emmision integrated between 0.01100 kev ) , @xmath22 , the blackbody temperature at 10 % of the eddington flux , @xmath23 , the rise time , @xmath24 , and the fluence , @xmath25 . as an indicator for the temperature of a burst we use the temperature in the time bin closest to 10 % of the eddington flux in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the eddington flux , @xmath26 , is defined by the highest peak flux from all the radius expansion bursts ( i.e. that of burst 9 : @xmath27 erg @xmath4 s@xmath28 ; at a distance of 4.3 kpc and assuming that the burst emission is isotropic this leads to @xmath29 erg s@xmath28 ) . to determine @xmath25 we sum the flux from the start of the burst until the end of the available data . to compensate for the missing fluence at the end of the burst (",
    "since the burst flux decays exponentially it finishes at infinite times ) , we fit the burst tail with an exponential function which we integrate from the end of the trigger file to infinity .",
    "we calculate the standard burst parameters ( see e.g. lewin et al .",
    "1993 ) @xmath30 ( @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the persistent flux just before the burst ) , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 $ ] ) and a lower limit ( because of south atlantic anomaly passages and earth occultations ) for @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the time since the previous burst ) . to determine the rise time , @xmath24 we use the pca light curve over the full pca energy band with a time resolution of 0.0312 s ( see figure [ fig : dynspec ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath24 as the time for the burst to increase from 25 % to 90 % of the peak rate .",
    "all burst parameters are shown in table [ tbl : spec ] .",
    "we can compare our values of @xmath22 with the peak bolometric flux found by franco ( 2000 , see also the note added to the manuscript ) for the same set of bursts .",
    "although they do not include the persistent emission in their listed values and extract spectra of 0.125 s instead of the 0.25 s we use , the two sets of results are in agreement .",
    "the profile of burst number 19 deviates strongly from all the other bursts ( see fig . [",
    "fig : burst19 ] ) .",
    "about 15 s before the burst really goes off the flux goes up and 9 s before the burst rise a small precursor occurs .",
    "the burst itself has a small fluence and is extremely short ( @xmath38 s ) compared to the other bursts ( @xmath39 s ) .",
    "including the pre - burst rise emission only increases the fluence by @xmath40 % , so it remains low .      to get a first indication of",
    "which bursts show oscillations we made leahy normalized power spectra ( leahy et al . 1983 ) starting a few seconds before the burst with a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz and a frequency resolution of 0.25 hz .",
    "we used a pca data mode with a 125@xmath41s time resolution and no energy resolution ( the pca is sensitive in the 260 kev range ) .",
    "we determine if there is any power between 360 and 365 hz ( based on previous results by strohmayer et al .",
    "1998b ) that is more significant than 3@xmath42 ( single trial ) .",
    "we find oscillations in 15 out of the 21 bursts .",
    "these preliminary detections were confirmed in our further analysis ( see below ) .",
    "we then examined the bursts with oscillations more closely .",
    "we made leahy normalized dynamical power spectra starting about 4 s before the rise and extending to about 12 s after the rise .",
    "the dynamical power spectrum is composed of individual power spectra each covering a 4 s interval .",
    "these intervals overlap , each new interval starting 0.125 s later than the previous one , increasing the time resolution at the expense of introducing correlations .",
    "we initially looked for oscillations between 300 and 400 hz but found no evidence for oscillations outside the 360365 hz interval .",
    "we show the dynamical power spectra between 360 and 365 hz for the bursts that show oscillations in figure [ fig : dynspec ] . for each individual power spectrum",
    "there are 21 frequency bins between 360 and 365 hz . due to the overlaps , adjacent power spectra",
    "are correlated ; after each 4 s the power spectra become uncorrelated . in a dynamical power spectrum with a total duration of 16 s",
    "there are four independent power spectra , which leads to a total of 84 ( @xmath43 ) independent powers . for clarity",
    "we plot only those powers above a value of 9.2 , the 99% confidence detection level for a single trial . in each plot",
    "about one independent power can be expected to exceed this level due to only poisson noise fluctuations .",
    "such a power fluctuation can show up in several adjacent power spectra .",
    "in each plot we include the pca light curve over the full pca energy band .",
    "the light curve and power spectra are aligned such that each point in the dynamical power spectrum represents a power spectrum taken over 2 s before and 2 s after the corresponding point in the light curve .",
    "for the four strongest frequency tracks ( 4 , 5 , 14 and 17 ) we list the frequency shift and frequency endpoint of the tracks seen in figure [ fig : dynspec ] in table [ tbl : freq_shft ] .",
    "we note that these values might be influenced by noise powers ( on average one per plot , see above ) accidentally situated near the beginning or end of a frequency track .",
    "because the frequency of the oscillation drifts during the 4 s interval for which each power spectrum is computed , the power spreads over a number of frequency bins . to compute the total power of the oscillation for each power spectrum we first find the highest power , @xmath44 , between 360 and 365 hz .",
    "we then determine the poisson level , @xmath45 , by averaging between 1000 and 1500 hz and add up all power ( @xmath46 ) above the poisson level in an interval of 4 hz around the frequency bin containing @xmath44 . as the oscillation signal is deterministic , the error in the power of each frequency bin is equal to @xmath45 so the error in the total power is obtained by quadratically adding these powers over the 4 hz interval . from the resulting total oscillation power",
    "we calculate the rms fractional amplitude plotted in the bottom frames of figure [ fig : dynspec ] .",
    "we only plot the rms fractional amplitude when the corresponding @xmath44 is larger than 9.2 and the corresponding @xmath46 differs more then 1 @xmath42 from 0 . when this is not the case we calculate an upper limit in the same way as for the bursts that show no oscillations ( see below ) .    for the bursts that show no significant oscillations we perform an identical dynamic power spectral analysis as above .",
    "no significant oscillations are present .",
    "we add up all power above the poisson level between 360 and 365 hz , @xmath47 , calculate the @xmath48 error in this power in the same way as for @xmath46 ( see above ) and use this to obtain a 97.5 % confidence upper limit on @xmath46 ( @xmath49 = @xmath47 + 2 @xmath50 error ) .",
    "previous studies of spectral burst parameters in 4u 172834 have been made with heao 1 ( hoffman et al .",
    "1979 ) , einstein ( grindlay & hertz 1981 ) , exosat ( foster et al . 1986 ) , astron ( kaminker et al . 1989 ) , and ginga ( day & tawara 1990 ) .",
    "the most extensive study was done with sas 3 by basinska et al .",

    "basinska et al . (",
    "1984 ) observed a strong , approximately linear , correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath51 at low @xmath25 levels ; at higher @xmath25 values there was a turnover at @xmath52 erg @xmath4 s@xmath28 and they suggested that the source had reached a critical luminosity . in our sample",
    "the strong correlation extends to values for @xmath51 up to @xmath53 erg @xmath4 s@xmath28 . we do not observe a turnover and @xmath51 clearly exceeds @xmath54 erg @xmath4 s@xmath28 .",
    "we note that the measured values of @xmath51 depend on the size of the used time bins .",
    "however , this can not account for the much larger @xmath51 we observe .",
    "we find @xmath33 ranging between 4.7 and 6.8 s , with the exception of burst 19 , which has @xmath55 s. excluding the so called `` super burst '' ( basinska et al .",
    "1994 , see figure [ fig : basinska ] ) which has @xmath56 s basinska et al .",
    "( 1984 ) found @xmath33 to range between 5.1 and 12.3 s , and that the rise times were , with one exception , all short ( @xmath57 s ) ; this is consistent with our results .",

    "only four 16 s points were available prior to the burst , leading to larger errors in the colors .",
    "the position of each burst in the color  color diagram is shown in figure [ fig : cd ] .",
    "for each burst we find the rank number as used by di salvo et al .",
    "( 2000a ) to mark the position in the color  color diagram .",
    "the soft color , hard color , rank number as well as the count rate in the 2.016.0 kev band are listed in table [ tbl : obs ] . to study the correlation between the various burst spectral properties and position in the color  color diagram we plot several parameters versus their rank number in figure [ fig : rn_vs_sp ] .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath22 ( and thus @xmath30 ) clearly correlate with the position in the color color diagram , both decreasing with rank number ( while @xmath30 increases ) .",
    "although @xmath23 and @xmath33 change only marginally they also appear to decrease with rank number .    in the right  hand panel of figure [ fig : cd ]",
    ", we marked the bursts with radius expansion with open symbols .",
    "the bursts with radius expansion that show the unusual radius variations described in  2.1 are marked with open diamonds .",
    "all the bursts in the island state , some of the bursts on the lower banana , and none of the bursts on the upper banana show radius expansion . in the left  hand panel of figure",
    "[ fig : cd ] , the bursts with oscillations are marked with filled circles , the ones without with pluses .",
    "the 5 bursts with rank numbers below 7 ( island state ) show no oscillations .",
    "these are precisely bursts 812 , which exhibited the unusual radius variations ( see  2.1 ) . the bursts with rank numbers greater than 9 ( the edge of the island state and the banana branch ) all show oscillations ( except the weak burst 3 at rank number 14 , whose oscillation upper limit is consistent with the oscillation strength seen in the other bursts ) .",
    "these oscillating bursts therefore include all bursts with radius expansion that had no unusual radius variations , as well as all bursts ( except burst 3 ) without radius expansion .",
    "upper limits indicate that oscillations in the island state , if any , really have a lower rms than those on the banana branch and are not just harder to detect due to lower count rates there . to demonstrate this we find the rms fractional amplitude corresponding to the largest @xmath46 or @xmath49 in each burst .",
    "from this we exclude the first 4 s of figure [ fig : dynspec ] where the resulting rms fractional amplitudes are systematically high because the summed count rate over 4 s contains a fraction of counts from the persistent emission .",
    "the peak rms fractional amplitudes and upper limits are plotted in figure [ fig : rms_vs_rn ] .",
    "the higher peak rms fractional amplitudes tend to occur at higher rank numbers .",
    "the dynamical power spectra of the bursts with oscillations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynspec ] ) show several different types of frequency tracks .",
    "a remarkable difference can be seen between the frequency tracks of the bursts with oscillations _ with _ radius expansion ( 1 , 2 , 7 , 20 and 21 ) , and those without ( 46 and 1319 ) . in the first group , with one exception (",
    "burst 21 ) , oscillations appear only after the burst has reached its maximum flux , whereas in the second group the oscillations always appear right at the start of the burst .",
    "note that for burst 6 , while we see the oscillations at the start of the burst , they appear later than in the other bursts with early oscillations .",
    "burst 6 is also the burst which in its group has the strongest hint for radius expansion .",
    "previously , all oscillations observed in the tails of bursts appeared after the contraction phase of a radius expansion episode ( smith , morgan & bradt 1997 ; muno et al . 2000 ) . here we observe tail oscillations both in bursts with ( e.g. burst 1 ) and without ( e.g. burst 17 ) radius expansion .",
    "all bursts without radius expansion exhibited oscillations in the burst rise ; the radius expansion bursts with oscillations ( except burst 21 ) did not .",
    "so , in radius expansion bursts , as reported before , the oscillations appear after radius `` touchdown '' at the end of the radius expansion phase , but contrary to other sources ( 4u 163654 , strohmayer et al .",
    "1998a ; ks 1731260 , muno et al .",
    "2000 ) , in 4u 172834 there is a strong tendency for them to be entirely undetectable in the burst rise .",
    "remember that the grey  scale power amplitudes in figure [ fig : dynspec ] refer to the 4 seconds around the point where they are plotted .",
    "bursts 4 , 5 , and 17 show a `` complete '' frequency track , where in about 10 s the frequency rises by @xmath59 hz before converging asymptotically to @xmath60 hz .",
    "the initial rise in frequency seems to be steeper in burst 17 than in the other two . in all other bursts it seems that we only observe part of a full track such as seen in bursts 4 , 5 , or 17 .",
    "the oscillations in these bursts always show up in the time ",
    "frequency position where one would expect them based upon the shape of the frequency track in either bursts 4 and 5 , or burst 17 .",
    "we do not observe frequency decreases such as seen in one burst in 4u 163653 ( miller 2000 ; strohmayer 1999 ) and one burst in ks 1731260 ( muno et al . 2000 ) .",
    "there have been several previous studies linking burst parameters to inferred mass accretion rate .",
    "some studies used the persistent flux as an indicator for mass accretion rate ( e.g. exo 0748676 , gottwald et al .",
    "1986 ; 4u 160853 , murakami et al . 1980 ; van paradijs , penninx & lewin 1988 ) .",
    "however , studies of the kilohertz qpos and timing features at low frequency have shown that for the lmxbs the position in the color  color diagram is a better correlator to the timing properties and hence may be a better indicator for mass accretion rate than the persistent flux ( hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) , for a review see van der klis et al .",
    "2000 ) . for 4u 163652 and 4u 170544 it was shown earlier that the correlation between burst parameters @xmath23 , @xmath33 and position of the source in the color  color diagram was strong , where the correlation with the persistent flux was lacking ( van der klis et al . 1990 ) . in 4u 172834",
    "we find no preference for the position in the color  color diagram over the persistent flux as a correlator with the burst spectral properties as there was with properties of the kilohertz qpos ( & van der klis 1999 ) and with properties of several low frequency features ( di salvo et al .",
    "perhaps this is due to the relatively large intrinsic scatter in the burst parameters . in this work we use the position in the color  color diagram , as in view of the results for other sources ( see above ) we expect this to be the more robust correlator .",
    "we now compare our results with those recently obtained for ks 1731260 by muno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in table",
    "[ tbl : comp ] we compare several properties of ks 1731260 and 4u 172834 .",
    "ks 1731260 showed only two distinct states , the island state and the banana branch with no data covering the transition between these two states .",
    "the bursts in the island state were longer ( @xmath33 @xmath61 s ) than those on the banana branch ( @xmath62 s ) .",
    "the peak flux was slightly lower ( @xmath63 erg @xmath4 s@xmath28 ) in the island state than on the banana branch ( @xmath64 erg @xmath4 s@xmath28 ) , and @xmath25 was higher ( @xmath65 erg @xmath4 ) in the island state than on the banana branch ( @xmath66 erg @xmath4 ) .",
    "radius expansion bursts were observed on the banana branch but not in the island state .    in 4u 172834 ,",
    "contrary to the case of ks 1731260 , we observe a smooth transition between the island state and the banana branch .",
    "di salvo et al .",
    "( 2000a ) found that power spectra with rank numbers 111 are typical of the island state , 14 corresponds to the lower banana and 19 to the upper banana .",
    "we find that from island to banana @xmath33 changes only marginally , from @xmath67 s in the island state to @xmath68 s on the banana branch .",
    "another source for which @xmath33 is about constant ( and also short , with @xmath69 ) over a wide range of @xmath22 and @xmath25 ( and we know that in 4u 172834 @xmath22 and @xmath25 depend on rank number ) is 4u 173544 ( lewin et al . 1980 ) .",
    "however , most sources show the same behaviour as ks 1731260 , namely @xmath33 is several tens of seconds at low inferred mass accretion rate and about 5 s at high inferred mass accretion rate ( e.g. , exo 0748676 , gottwald et al . 1986 ; 4u 163653 , van der klis et al . 1990 ; 4u 170544 , van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "we note that a previous study of 4u 172834 by basinska et al .",
    "( 1984 ) did show a larger range in @xmath33 ( 5.112.3 s ) .",
    "another difference with ks 1731260 is that in 4u 172834 the bursts in the island state show radius expansion ( albeit with unusual radius variations ) , and have a higher @xmath22 . as the source moves from the lower towards the upper banana",
    "the radius expansion episodes disappear and @xmath22 becomes smaller ( see figures [ fig : cd ] and [ fig : rn_vs_sp ] ) .",
    "the sources exo 0748676 ( gottwald et al .",
    "1986 ) and 4u 170544 ( langmeier et al . 1987 ) like ks 1731260",
    "but contrary to 4u 172834 both show _ higher _ peak fluxes at higher inferred mass accretion rates .",
    "the fluence in 4u 172834 does show a similar behaviour to ks 1731260 : it changes gradually from about @xmath70 erg @xmath4 in the island state to @xmath71 erg @xmath4 on the banana branch ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rn_vs_sp ] ) .    in ks",
    "1731260 oscillations were found only to occur on the banana branch and not in the island state ( muno et al .",
    "2000 ) . for 4u 172834",
    "we also observe that burst oscillations appear at the higher inferred mass accretion states ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cd ] ) .",
    "because we see a gradual transition between island and banana state , we can ascertain that oscillations are already detectable when the power spectrum of the persistent emission ( di salvo et al .",
    "2000a ) still indicates an island state ( see above ) .",
    "cumming & bildsten ( 2000 ) explain the presence / absence of burst oscillations in ks 1731260 in terms of the presence / absence of a h  rich region .",
    "they show that if an oscillation is generated near the burning layers , it can escape coherently from a helium  rich region , but not from a h  rich region . the bursts in ks 1731260 show characteristics of pure he ignition ( short durations , radius expansion and high peak flux ) when the source is in the banana state , and of mixed h / he ignition when the source is in the island state ; and oscillations occur only when there is pure he ignition .",
    "however , in 4u 172834 in the island state we observe that the burst oscillations disappear while the bursts still have all characteristics of pure he ignition .    in ks 1731260",
    "the presence of burst oscillations and radius expansion were nearly perfectly correlated ; all but one of the bursts with burst oscillations also had radius expansion , and none of the bursts without oscillations showed radius expansion .",
    "in contrast , in 4u 172834 radius expansion bursts occur below a certain inferred mass accretion rate level , burst oscillations above another level and in the middle both phenomena occur in the same bursts .",
    "it is striking that the bursts with radius expansion that show the unusual radius variations described in  2.1 are exactly the bursts from which the oscillations are absent .",
    "we can not from our data determine if unusual radius variations and absence of oscillations have a causal relation or are both just a characteristic of bursts occurring at low inferred mass accretion rate . nevertheless ,",
    "while there may not be a good correlation between the occurrence of radius expansion and burst oscillations , the way the radius expansion occurs may in fact be physically connected to the occurrence of oscillations .",
    "perhaps , the unusual radius variations , which occur only in our most energetic bursts , are an indication that the magnetic fuel containment near the magnetic poles ( a possible explanation for late burst oscillations , miller 1999 ) is less efficient in stronger bursts .",
    "so , it seems that both in ks 1731260 and in 4u 172834 the timing as well as the spectral parameters of the bursts depend monotonically on the position of the source in the color  color diagram . also , both in ks 1731260 and 4u 172834 the presence / absence of the burst oscillations depends on the position in the color  color diagram in more or less the same way .",
    "however , the dependence of most of the spectral burst parameters on the position in the color  color diagram shows a clear discrepancy between the two sources , from which we are led to conclude that the correlations between spectral burst parameters and the occurrence of oscillations suggested from the ks 1731260 data is not universal .    to summarize :    * the burst oscillations become significantly weaker ( and in fact undetectable ) in the island state without the characteristics of the bursts switching from pure he to mixed h and he unstable burning , as occurs in ks 1731260 .",
    "* radius expansion per se does not determine the presence or absence of burst oscillations .",
    "both are more likely to occur at lower inferred mass accretion rates . *",
    "contrary to what was noted in muno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for other sources , we do observe oscillations in the tails of non radius expansion bursts .",
    "* among our bursts with radius expansion , the most energetic ones at the lowest inferred mass accretion rate , which show an unexpected spectral behaviour with a double  peaked radius curve do not show burst oscillations , while the others do . * among our bursts with oscillations , the radius expansion bursts ( with one exception ) show no oscillations during the burst rise whereas non  radius expansion bursts do .    as the only two sources studied",
    "until now already show remarkable differences in their behavior , further studies of correlated spectral and timing behaviour of other type i x  ray bursters showing burst oscillations are necessary to come to a full understanding of just what determines whether , and if so , in which part of its profile , a burst oscillates .",

    "was submitted we became aware of a paper in preparation by franco ( 2000 ) on the burst oscillations in 4u 172834 .",
    "where between the two papers conclusions overlap , they are consistent . to avoid confusion , we note that our definition of a `` complete frequency '' track is more restrictive than `` a burst with oscillations in the rise and the tail '' used in franco ( 2000 ) .",
    "we call a frequency track `` complete '' only when the oscillations are present essentially throughout the entire burst ( @xmath72 14 s ) .",

    "<S> we study correlations between the burst properties and the position in the color  color diagram of the low mass x - ray binary 4u 172834 using 21 bursts found in two data sets obtained with the rossi x - ray timing explorer . using spectral fits </S>",

    "<S> the radius expansion bursts with and without burst oscillations differ both with respect to where they occur in the color  color diagram and in how the radius expansion takes place . </S>",

    "<S> both ks 1731260 and 4u 172834 show more or less the same behavior with respect to the dependence of the presence / absence of the burst oscillations on the position of the source in the color  color diagram , but the dependence of most of the spectral burst parameters on the position in the color  color diagram is clearly different . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the systematic absence in 4u 172834 of burst oscillations in the `` island '' state of the color  color diagram is not explained by the bursts involving mixed h  he burning , as may be the case in ks 1731260 ( cumming & bildsten 2000 ) . </S>"
