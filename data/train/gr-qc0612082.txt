    "the principle of relativity in its strong form states that the laws of physics are the same in all standard inertial frames , if gravitational effects are excluded .",
    "it was used by einstein to derive the lorentz transformation @xmath0@xmath1 , between two standard inertial frames @xmath2 , @xmath3 moving apart with relative speed @xmath4 along the @xmath5-direction @xcite .",
    "a notable feature is the loss of absolute simultaneity : a hyperplane of simultaneity @xmath6 in @xmath3 is not a hyperplane of simultaneity in @xmath7 .",
    "we shall investigate the consequences of adding quantum physics to this feature of relativity .",
    "in contrast to most approaches to relativity , we shall focus on very specific hyperplanes of simultaneity , one in each frame . for convenience",
    ", we shall ignore the @xmath8 and @xmath9 coordinates ; although they are physically relevant , they do not feature in the essential points of the discussion .",
    "we shall consider an experiment where a signal is sent from @xmath10 at time @xmath11 and observed in frame @xmath3 at time @xmath12 , as measured in its frame .",
    "figure @xmath13 shows the essential details .",
    "is the quantum horizon . , width=288 ]    event @xmath14 is the common origin of spacetime coordinates , events @xmath15 and @xmath16 are simultaneous in @xmath10 at time @xmath11 whilst events @xmath17 , @xmath18 are simultaneous in @xmath3 at time @xmath19 .",
    "our convention is that an event @xmath15 has coordinates @xmath20 in @xmath10 , coordinates @xmath21 $ ] in @xmath3 and we write @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "a critical feature is event @xmath23 , where the lines of simultaneity @xmath11 and @xmath19 intersect .",
    "assuming @xmath4 is positive , then for @xmath23 we have @xmath24.\\ ] ]    recall that in de broglie wave mechanics , the speed @xmath25 of a pilot wave associated with a physical particle moving with subluminal speed @xmath4 satisfies the relation @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests that such a pilot wave can not be used to convey physical signals , because it travels at superluminal speed .",
    "the position of event @xmath23 appears to observers in @xmath27 to be the wave front at time @xmath28 of such a pilot wave associated with frame @xmath10 , if it were sent out from @xmath14 in the same direction .",
    "clearly , for large @xmath28 and small @xmath29 , @xmath23 will be at relatively large distance from the origin of spatial coordinates @xmath30 in frame @xmath3 , at the time @xmath31 when the signal from @xmath10 is observed in @xmath32 during the experiment .    in standard discussions of special relativity , event @xmath23",
    "is generally ignored , as it appears to be far removed from events @xmath15 and @xmath17 involved in the signalling experiment . for this experiment , we imagine that a quantum state has been prepared by apparatus @xmath33 at rest in frame @xmath10 , and a contingent quantum outcome subsequently detected by apparatus @xmath34 , at rest in frame @xmath27 .",
    "the critical word here is _ subsequently .",
    "_ quantum physics , * as it is performed in real laboratories * , can discuss only the possibility of quantum information travelling forwards in time .",
    "both signal emitter and signal detector in any quantum experiment must agree that the former acts before the latter .",
    "otherwise , the physical significance of the born probability rule would be completely undermined .",
    "in quantum theory and in the real world , we do not know the outcome of an experiment before it is performed .",
    "we shall call the requirement that @xmath15 is earlier than @xmath17 in both frames of reference _ quantum causality . _    from figure @xmath13",
    ", it is clear that there is no problem with quantum causality as far as events @xmath15 and @xmath17 are concerned . but consider events @xmath16 and @xmath18 on the other side of @xmath23 . if quantum causality is valid , then signals prepared at @xmath16 can not be received by @xmath18 .",
    "in essence , event @xmath23 acts a barrier to quantum causality , and on this account we shall refer to @xmath23 as a _ quantum horizon .",
    "_    ordinarily , such quantum horizons are ignored in conventional physics , because under most circumstances , @xmath23 appears to be very far from events such as @xmath15 and @xmath17 . in experiments looking at such aspects of quantum information ,",
    "speeds in excess of @xmath35 @xmath36 have been reported @xcite . in practice , high energy particle theory conventionally takes the scattering limit @xmath28 @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39 in the calculation of lorentz covariant matrix elements .",
    "finite - time processes and inter - frame experiments of the sort considered by us here are generally avoided , because it is assumed there is no significant novel physics involved .",
    "an important factor in this is that the scattering limit makes calculations such as those arising from feynman diagrams take on relatively standard forms and does not involve issues to do with a quantum horizon , which is at spatial infinity under those circumstances .",
    "such a simplification does not happen for finite - time and inter - frame processes .",
    "we now consider the implications of the relativity principle and ask the following question : if according to the relativity principle frames @xmath2 and @xmath3 are just as good as each other , why does the quantum horizon @xmath23 appear to distinguish between the two ?    a little though soon resolves the question . if the relativity principle is valid , then there must be a symmetry between the two frames .",
    "there is no doubt that a quantum signal can be prepared at @xmath15 and received at @xmath40 , if @xmath17 is in or on the forwards lightcone with vertex @xmath41 quantum causality rules out the transmission of a quantum signal from @xmath17 to @xmath15 , and the transmission of a signal from @xmath16 to @xmath42 . but",
    "nothing currently known in physics forbids the possibility of a physical signal being sent from @xmath18 to @xmath16 , if @xmath16 is in the forwards lightcone with vertex @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , symmetry demands such a possibility .",
    "this is the essence of the split causality experiment proposed here .",
    "based on the above considerations , we propose the following experimental test of the principle of special relativity .",
    "it will undoubtedly be difficult to perform , but would test the principle of relativity in a spectacular and convincing way .",
    "we envisage the use of four spacecraft @xmath43 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , sufficiently far from gravitating bodies to justify the use of the special relativistic transformation rules ( [ 111 ] ) . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are in the same rest frame @xmath10 and situated at some distance from each other . by prior signalling arrangement , clocks on @xmath15 and @xmath16 craft have been synchronized .",
    "likewise , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are in their own rest frame @xmath3 and all their clocks have been synchronized .    with reference to figure @xmath13",
    ", spacetime homogeneity means that we may always transfer the origin of spacetime coordinates in both frames @xmath10 , @xmath27 to the quantum horizon @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the hyperplanes of simultaneity involved in the experiment are now at times @xmath11 in @xmath10 and @xmath44 in @xmath3 , as shown in figure @xmath45 .",
    "the experiment consists of @xmath15 sending a brief light pulse signal towards @xmath40 at time @xmath11 , whilst simultaneously in @xmath10 , @xmath16 opens a detector in order to receive light from @xmath18 for a similar brief period .",
    "in addition , the same protocol is carried out in frame @xmath27 at time @xmath44 : @xmath18 sends a brief light pulse towards @xmath16 whilst simultaneously in @xmath3 , @xmath40 opens a detector to receive a signal from @xmath15 .",
    "the whole experiment is illustrated in figure @xmath45 .",
    "is the quantum horizon .",
    "shaded regions are forwards lightcones .",
    "signals shown with subluminal transmission speeds , which do not alter the overall conclusions.,width=288 ]    after the signals have been sent and received , observers from all spacecraft can meet at leisure and compare results .",
    "if it turns out that @xmath15 sent a signal at the same time @xmath11 that @xmath16 received a signal , and that @xmath40 received a signal at the same time @xmath44 that @xmath42 sent a signal , then the principle of relativity would be upheld in a most convincing way .",
    "quantum causality would have been respected but classical causality would appear to be split  in a most remarkable and counterintuitive fashion . on the other hand , if no such result was ever detected despite repeated attempts , this would rule out the principle of special relativity and undermine the whole of conventional physics . alternatively , quantum causality would have to be reviewed , with equally disastrous implications for modern physics .    although the result may appear a forgone conclusion in favour of the relativity principle , complacency here would be unjustifiable .",
    "an actual experiment involving relatively moving frames has to be involved .",
    "it would not do to simulate the experiment using a single frame of reference and invoking scattering processes involving high energy particles , unless the issues of the meaning of timing of virtual particle processes which would inevitably arise were adequately resolved .",
    "such an inter - frame experiment would not need to be performed more than once to establish the principle of relativity in the most spectacular way ; a single splitting of causality would suffice to vindicate both the lorentz transformation rule ( [ 111 ] ) and our insistence on the need for the quantum causality rule .",
    "the difficulties in this experiment are of course technological .",
    "first , it would be expensive though not impossible to arrange four spacecraft in such a configuration .",
    "current resources rule out such a possibility , but we envisage that with the present increasing interest in the colonization of the moon and subsequent journeys to mars , space travel will develop into a more routine activity , with an increased availability of vehicles for such an experiment",
    ".    some economy could be found by using the moon and some other body , such as the earth or a suitable asteroid , to locate say events @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a significant residual problem would be the need to boost the two spacecraft representing events @xmath17 and @xmath18 to sufficiently high speed @xmath29 to allow unambiguous effects to be observed .",
    "an even greater economy could be made by using four small unmanned but self - propelled probes , two of which were programmed to emit signals whilst the other two were programmed to receive them . such an experiment seems within the capability of present - day technology .",
    "we note that the signals involved need not be light signals .",
    "any form of communication with subluminal propagation speeds in the proposed set - up should demonstrate classical split - causality , if the principle of relativity holds .",
    "the above scenario involves classical signalling processes .",
    "an even more interesting situation arises when quantum entangled states are involved , as this touches upon the debate concerning information loss in black hole physics .",
    "consider the experiment illustrated by figure @xmath46 , where a spin zero positronium state is prepared at event @xmath47 .",
    "the forwards lightcone with vertex @xmath47 contains events @xmath43 , @xmath17 and @xmath42 , so that in principle each event could detect component particles of the prepared state .",
    "we shall imagine restricting @xmath15 and @xmath40 to the observation of electron spin orientation only , via stern - gerlach apparatus , whilst @xmath16 and @xmath18 do the same for positrons .",
    "depending on the choices made , a number of different observation protocols could be implemented , but not necessarily all in the same run ( we assume the overall experiment is repeatable as often as required to collect adequate statistics ) .",
    "it is useful here to assign a different hilbert space to each such observation protocol : @xmath48 is the hilbert space used to describe the potential outcome of an electron spin test at @xmath15 , @xmath49 is the hilbert space used to describe a simultaneous - in-@xmath10 observation of an electron at @xmath15 and a positron at @xmath16 , and so on .",
    "provided @xmath18 was instructed in advance not to perform its test , then @xmath15 and @xmath16 could perform their tests , describing the state prepared by @xmath47 in terms of an entangled state in @xmath50 of the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 represents a spin - up outcome at @xmath15 , @xmath53 represents a spin - down outcome at @xmath16 , and so on .",
    "likewise , provided @xmath15 was instructed in advance not to perform its test , then @xmath17 and @xmath18 could perform their tests , describing the prepared state in term of the entangled state @xmath54 , an element in @xmath55 .",
    "conservation of electric charge rules out any possibility of outcomes described via @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "however , in principle , it should be possible to involve outcomes described in @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "an interesting possibility arises with an experiment described initially in @xmath60 .",
    "in such an experiment , @xmath16 would always observe a positron whenever @xmath15 observed an electron .",
    "now consider the addition of a choice at @xmath18 to test positron spin .",
    "any observation at @xmath18 would take place before @xmath16 , according to frames @xmath10 and @xmath3 , and therefore quantum causality would apply .",
    "the detection of a positron at @xmath18 would destroy the possibility of a detection of a positron at @xmath16 , because of charge conservation .",
    "this would hold even if @xmath16 was outside the forwards lightcone centred on @xmath18 , as shown in figure @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests that a free choice at @xmath18 could have superluminal consequences at @xmath61 , apparently in conflict with relativity .",
    "our resolution of this conflict is to note that if @xmath16 is outside the forwards lightcone of @xmath18 , then in effect we should regard @xmath15 , @xmath42 _ and _ @xmath16 as on some hypersurface of simultaneity , which , like @xmath62 and @xmath63 , can not be identified with a single inertial frame .",
    "there is no requirement in relativistic quantum mechanics to restrict all experiments to single inertial frames . what matters is quantum causality .",
    "we see from this discussion that the principle of quantum causality has to be applied not just with respect to hyperplanes of simultaneity in inertial frames , but for arbitrary spacelike hypersurfaces as well .",
    "quantum causality should hold even in those experiments where various pieces of apparatus lie in different inertial frames .",
    "given this observation , we deduce that after the state is prepared at @xmath47 , an electron can be detected at @xmath15 , a positron detected at @xmath16 and nothing detected at @xmath18 for some runs , whilst for other runs , an electron would be detected at @xmath15 , a positron detected at @xmath18 , and nothing detected at @xmath16",
    ". there would be no possibility of using this experiment to signal from @xmath18 to @xmath16 , if @xmath16 lay outside the forwards lightcone centred on @xmath18 .",
    "we denote the hilbert space involved in this extended experiment by @xmath64 .",
    "we observe that for this experimental setup , @xmath65 can not be the tensor product @xmath66 , because any detection of a positron at @xmath18 rules out the detection of a positron at @xmath16 , and vice - versa .",
    "instead , we would have @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be regarded as mutual orthogonal complements in @xmath70 . it should be possible to use standard quantum relativistic field theory to determine the respective outcome probabilities at @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "these will depend on where the detectors are situated .    finally , we comment on the meaning of entanglement .",
    "it is not physically meaningful to talk about the preparation of quantum states , entangled or not , without reference to any context of subsequent observation .",
    "it is the choice of test apparatus which determines whether a state is to be regarded as entangled or not .",
    "for instance , in figure @xmath46 , we could not locate @xmath47 on the quantum horizon @xmath14 and meaningfully talk about an entangled electron - positron state from the point of view of any tests involving pieces of equipment on either side of the quantum horizon .",
    "in any discussion involving quantum information and black hole physics , problems will inevitably arise whenever quantum states are discussed without due regard for the equipment used to test them .",
    "for this reason , all discussions of quantum mechanics across event horizons or wavefunctions for the universe without due reference to observers and their equipment should be avoided as metaphysical ."
