    "in all studies of relativistic properties of nuclear matter , mean field models are usually the models of first choice @xcite .",
    "these models use a statistical approach based on boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics which is , strictly speaking , only correct when the corresponding heat bath is homogeneous and infinite .",
    "these conditions are by no means met in realistic situations in which nuclear matter occurs .",
    "usually one encounters some inherent problems arising , for example , from the smallness of the collisional systems and their rapid evolution .",
    "these , among other things , render the spatial configuration of the system far from uniform and prevent global equilibrium from being established ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) . as a result ,",
    "some quantities become non extensive and develop power - law tailed rather than exponential distributions .",
    "the widely used way to account for these effects is to resort to a nonextensive statistics , known as @xmath0-statistics @xcite .",
    "the new phenomenological nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 occurring there is supposed to account for all possible dynamical factors violating the assumptions of the usual bg statistics .",
    "this is recovered in the limit of @xmath3 .",
    "because it enters into the respective formulas of the particular dynamical model used for a given investigation , it allows for a simple phenomenological check of the stability of the model against possible deviations from the bg approach .",
    "so far , applications of the nonextensive approach are numerous and cover all branches of physics @xcite .",
    "these include high energy multiparticle production processes ( cf . , @xcite ) and different aspects of nuclear and quark matter @xcite .",
    "the nonextensive framework can also be derived from a special treatment of kinetic theory investigating complex systems in their nonequilibrium stationary states @xcite .",
    "some examples of more specialized topics can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "for an illustration , the tsallis distribution , @xmath4 , and bg distribution , @xmath5 , are connected as follows : @xmath6^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\label{eq : tsallis}\\\\ & \\stackrel{q \\rightarrow 1}{\\longrightarrow } & f(e ) = \\frac{1}{t}\\exp \\left(-\\frac{e}{t}\\right ) .",

    "are recent applications of nonextensive statistics in description of nuclear @xcite and quarkonic matter @xcite , the later of which we shall continue here . in @xcite , the @xmath0-version of the walecka many - body field theory @xcite has been investigated .",
    "it was shown there that @xmath0-statistics results in the enhancement of the scalar and vector meson fields in nuclear matter , in diminishing of the nucleon effective mass and in hardening of the nuclear equation of state ( only the @xmath7 case was considered there ) . in @xcite",
    "the relativistic equation of state of hadronic matter and a quark - gluon plasma at finite temperature and baryon density was investigated in the framework of nonextensive statistical mechanics . in our work",
    "@xcite we investigated a nonextensive version of another mean field theory , namely the qcd - based nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model of a many - body field theory describing the behavior of strongly interacting matter presented recently in @xcite .",
    "this time , unlike in @xcite , we used the quark rather than the hadronic degrees of freedom and , because of this , we had to consider both the @xmath7 and @xmath9 cases .",
    "this @xmath0-njl model allowed us to discuss the @xmath0-dependence of the chiral phase transition in dense quark matter , in particular the quark condensates and the effective quark masses and their influence on the masses of @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons and on the spinodal decomposition ( cf .",
    ", @xcite for details ) .",
    "these results helped us proceed further and consider critical phenomena in strongly interaction matter using @xmath0-statistics ( these phenomena are of interest nowadays , cf .",
    ", for example , @xcite , but were so far not investigated in non - equilibrium environment provided by @xmath0-statistics ) . in particular , we shall now concentrate on the influence of dynamical factors causing nonextensivity and represented by the parameter @xmath0 in the vicinity of the _ critical end point _",
    "first we present the basic elements of the @xmath0-njl model introduced in @xcite ( to which we refer for more details ) .",
    "the values of the pressure , @xmath36 , and the energy density , @xmath37 , are defined as : @xmath38",

    "( [ eq : n ] ) and ( [ eq : barn ] ) .",
    "this is done following a prescription provided in @xcite , namely by replacing @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43 ( the important point to notice is that one encounters here @xmath44 , i.e. , that because of @xmath45 also energy is now a @xmath0-dependent quantity ) . denoting @xmath46 one has that for @xmath7 @xmath47^{\\frac{1}{q-1}}\\quad { \\rm if}\\quad x > 0 \\\\ \\\\ ~[1+(1-q)x]^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\quad { \\rm if}\\quad x\\leq 0 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",

    "this should show the particle - hole symmetry observed in the @xmath0-fermi distribution in plasma containing both particles and antiparticles , namely that @xmath50 this means , therefore , that in a system containing both particles and antiparticles ( as in our case ) both @xmath0 and @xmath51 occur ( or , when expressed by a single @xmath0 only , one can encounter both @xmath52 and @xmath53 at the same time ) .",
    "these dual possibilities warn us that not only @xmath7 but also @xmath48 ( or @xmath54 have physical meaning in the systems we are considering .",
    "this differentiates our @xmath0-njl model from the @xmath0-version of the model presented in @xcite .",
    "notice that for @xmath55 one recovers the standard fd distribution , @xmath56 .",
    "actually , it is important to realize that for @xmath57 one always gets @xmath58 , irrespectively of the value of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this means that we can expect any nonextensive signature only for high enough temperatures ( how high depends on circumstances and on the kind of observable considered , for illustration of this point see results presented in our paper @xcite and fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] below ) .    our @xmath0-njl model",
    "is then obtained by replacing the formulas of section [ iia ] with their @xmath0-counterparts in what concerns the form of the fd distributions . additionally , when calculating energies and condensates we follow @xcite and use the @xmath0-versions quark condensates , replacing eqs .",

    "( [ q_gap1 ] ) together with the @xmath0-version of the gap equation , eq .",
    "( [ q_gap ] ) , are the basic equations from which one deduces all results presented here .",
    "before presenting our results concerning nonextensive critical effects we shortly repeat the previous results ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "in fig . [ figure1 ] we present the typical pressure at critical temperature @xmath66 obtained in a @xmath0-njl model as a function of compression @xmath67 calculated for different values of the nonextensivity parameter @xmath0     +    ( see @xcite for more details on spinodial decomposition and chiral symmetry restoration in @xmath0-njl model ) deduced from the data allow us to argue that , to first approximation , @xmath68 used here and in @xcite . in high energy physics it is just the hadronizing temperature ( and instead of the state of equilibrium one deals there with some kind of stationary state ) . for a thorough discussion of the temperature of nonextensive systems , see @xcite . ] .",
    "notice that the effect is stronger for @xmath69 and that , essentially , the saddle point remains at the same value of compression .",
    "when one moves away from the critical temperature , the typical spinodal structure occurs , which is more pronounced for lower temperatures whereas its sensitivity to the @xmath0 parameter gets stronger with increasing temperature ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it occurs that , for each temperature ( even for very small one ) a @xmath7 exists for which there is no more mixed phase and for which the spinodal effect vanishes .",
    "this seems to be a quite natural effect in the scenario in which @xmath7 is attributed to the fluctuations of the temperature in a system considered as proposed in @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "effects like correlations or limitations of the phase space considered in @xcite work towards an increase of the @xmath66 and make the spinodal effect more pronounced .",
    "a few remarks are in order here ( for more detailed discussion we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "nonextensive dynamics enter the njl calculations through the quark ( antiquark ) number distribution functions @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "these functions are connected with the respective quark ( antiquarks ) spectral functions in the njl model .",
    "however , deviations from the exponential shape of @xmath0-exponents , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ qgt1 ] ) and ( [ qst1 ] ) , are negligible for values of @xmath0 close to unity ( in our case @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is also important to notice that eqs .",
    "( [ qgt1 ] ) and ( [ qst1 ] ) are symmetric for @xmath73 .",
    "the differences between @xmath74 and @xmath75 cases observed in our results are then due to our way of defining the energy ( [ q_energy ] ) and entropy ( [ q entropy ] ) , which , following @xcite , we do by using @xmath76 and @xmath77 instead of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . case and uses number distributions without powers of @xmath0 , the significant effects were obtained only for much larger values of the nonextensive parameter @xmath78 . ] because now for @xmath74 distributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are closer to unity than @xmath79 and @xmath80 , therefore the absolute values of quark condensates ( as given by eq .",
    "( [ q_gap1 ] ) ) begin to decrease for @xmath81 at lower temperature as compared with the @xmath82 case .",
    "therefore the corresponding energy is larger , which means that @xmath9 introduces some residual attractive correlations which rise the energy and lead to hadronization occurring at lower temperature . on the other hand , @xmath83 introduces fluctuations which decrease the effective occupations ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) and the energy , and smears out the chiral phase transition . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we present our phase diagram in the @xmath84 plane for different nonextensivity parameters considered here with positions of the corresponding critical end points ( cep ) for different values of @xmath0 clearly indicated .",
    "the overlap of curves observed in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( inlet ) indicates how the critical end point is smeared to a kind of critical area .",
    "this is because fireballs created in different events can have different values of @xmath0 ( representing , as mentioned before , action of all factors responsible for the departure of our system from the usual bg approach - not specified here in detail but , in general , resulting in specific correlations of quarks or fluctuations of temperature mentioned before )",
    ". therefore when analyzing experimental data one most probably will encounter such a critical area instead of a well defined cep .    .",
    "[ figure4 ]    the role of all these factors is shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] which shows the baryon compression @xmath67 ( calculated in the vicinity of the critical values of temperature and density indicated by the corresponding dotted lines ) as the function of the chemical potential @xmath85 for different values of the nonextensivity parameter , @xmath86 .",
    "notice the remarkable difference of the density derivative at the critical point : from the smooth transition through the critical point for @xmath74 to a big jump in density for critical value of chemical potential for @xmath75 .",
    "it reflects the infinite values of the baryon number susceptibility , @xmath87 : @xmath88 the transition between confined and deconfined phases and/or chiral phase transition @xcite can be seen by measuring , event by event , the difference in the magnitude of local fluctuation of the net baryon number in a heavy ion collision @xcite .",
    "they are initiated and driven mainly by the quark number fluctuation , described here by @xmath87 , and can survive through the freezout @xcite .",
    "consequently , our q - njl model allows us to make the fine tuning for the magnitude of baryon number fluctuations ( measured , for example , by the charge fluctuations of protons ) and to find the value of the parameter @xmath0 characteristic for this system .",
    "however , it does not allow us to differentiate between possible dynamical mechanisms of baryon fluctuation .",
    "we close by noticing that using @xmath0 dependent @xmath87 leads to @xmath0-dependent parameter @xmath37 of the critical exponents which describe the behavior of baryon number susceptibilities near the critical point @xcite .",
    "whereas in the mean field universality class one has @xmath89 , our preliminary results using the @xmath0-njl model show a smaller value of this parameter for @xmath75 , ( @xmath90 for q=1.02 ) and greater for @xmath74 ( @xmath91 for q=0.98 )",
    ". it would be interesting to deduce the corresponding values of @xmath0 from different models and compare them with results on a lattice which , by definition , should correspond to @xmath82 ( it should be mentioned at this point that there are already attempts to apply monte carlo methods , simulating lattice gauge field dynamics as based on non - extensive rather than extensive thermodynamics , see @xcite and references therein ) .    in order to further investigate the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath87",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : sus ] ) in the following form ( recall that @xmath92 and @xmath93 is @xmath0-version of eq .",
    "( [ number ] ) ) : @xmath94 the @xmath0-versions of occupation numbers , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are taken from eq . ( [ tpm ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-version of energies there depend on masses @xmath45 , which are given by gap equation ( [ q_gap ] ) in a quite involved way .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-dependence enters here in two ways : by rather straightforward replacement of @xmath95 by the respective @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ tpm ] ) and by quite involved @xmath0-dependence of @xmath45 given by the gap equation ( [ q_gap ] ) .",

    "[ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] .",
    "it turns out that the chiral phase transition investigated here ( fig . [ figure5 ] ) is mainly driven by the behavior of the light quark mass derivative , see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , which in turn is determined by the behavior of the light condensate , cf .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "thus the dynamic of the nonextensive effects is generated not so much by the nonextensive form of occupation numbers in eq .",
    "( [ tpm ] ) but rather by the main gap equation ( [ gap ] ) where both the condensates and the effective quark masses are present .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of critical behavior of the qcd based njl type of mean theory type presented in @xcite , the @xmath0-njl model , to the departure from the conditions required by the application of the bg approach by using the tsallis version of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "all factors causing this departure are summarily described by the nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 , such that @xmath99 quantifies departure from the bg situation ( which is recovered for @xmath100 ) .",
    "we have investigated two possible scenarios corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath9 , respectively , which , as mentioned , correspond to different physical interpretations of the nonextensivity parameter . for @xmath69 (",
    "usually connected with some specific correlations @xcite or with fractal character of the phase space @xcite ) we observe a decreasing of pressure , which reaches negative values for a broad ( @xmath0-dependent ) range of temperatures and increasing of the critical temperature . the @xmath101 case ( usually connected with some specific nonstatistical fluctuations existing in the system @xcite ) we observe a decreasing of the critical temperature , @xmath102 , and",
    "therefore in the limit of large @xmath0 we do not have a mixed phase but rather a quark gas in the deconfined phase above the critical line ( on the contrary , the compression at critical temperature does not depend on @xmath0 . as in",
    "@xcite the resulting equation of state is stiffer ( in the sense that for a given density we get larger pressure with increasing @xmath0 ) .",
    "as expected , the effects depend on the temperature , and tend to vanish when the temperature approaches zero .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows that the nonequilibrium statistics dilutes the border between the crossover and the first order transition .",
    "finally , figs .",
    "[ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] demonstrate that the most important @xmath0-dependence is coming from the main gap equation ( [ gap ] ) , where both the condensates and the effective quark masses are present , rather than from the the nonextensive form of occupation numbers in eq .",
    "( [ tpm ] ) .",
    "we would like to end by stressing that our results could be of interest for investigations aimed at finding the critical point in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite or when studying particularities of the equation of state ( eos ) of compact stars @xcite .",
    "the fact that they depend on the parameter @xmath0 means that the exact position of such a point or the type or shape of eos could be quite different from what is naively expected .",
