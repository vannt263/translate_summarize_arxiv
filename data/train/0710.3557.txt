    "over the past few years , the most rapidly developing aspect of galaxy formation modelling has been the formation of massive galaxies ( see baugh 2006 for a review ) .",
    "on employing the standard white & frenk ( 1991 ) model for the radiative cooling of gas in massive dark matter haloes , hierarchical models have tended to overproduce luminous galaxies .",
    "one pragmatic solution to this problem is to simply stop `` by hand '' the formation of stars from cooling flows in high circular velocity haloes ( kauffmann et  al .",
    "a variety of physical mechanisms have been proposed to account for the suppression of the star formation rate in massive haloes , including : ( i ) the injection of energy into the hot gas halo to reduce its density and hence increase the cooling time ( bower et  al .",
    "2001 ; mccarthy et  al .",
    "2007 ) ; ( ii ) the fragmentation of the hot halo in a multi - phase cooling model ( maller & bullock 2004 ) ; ( iii ) the complete ejection of gas from the halo in a `` super wind '' ( benson et  al . 2003 ) ; ( iv ) the suppression of the cooling flow due to heating by an agn ( croton et  al . 2006",
    "; bower et  al .",

    "; benson et  al .",
    "with such a range of possible physical processes to choose from , it is important to develop tests of the models which can distinguish between them .",
    "the mechanisms invoked to suppress the formation of bright galaxies could scale in different ways with redshift , leading to different predictions for the galaxy properties at intermediate and high redshift .",
    "in this paper we present new tests of the physical processes invoked to suppress the formation of bright galaxies . at the present day , the bright end of the luminosity function is dominated by early - type galaxies with passively evolving stellar populations ( e.g. norberg et  al .",
    "2002 ) . here",
    "we focus on a subset of bright galaxies , luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) and test the model predictions for the abundance and properties of these red , massive galaxies .",
    "lrgs were originally selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et  al .",
    "2000 ) on the basis of their colours and luminosities ( eisenstein et  al .",
    "the red colour selection isolates galaxies with a strong 4000  break and a passively evolving stellar population .",
    "the galaxies selected tend to be significantly brighter than @xmath0 .",
    "the sdss sample has a median redshift of @xmath9 .",
    "recently , the construction of lrg samples has been extended to higher redshifts , using sdss photometry and the 2df and aaomega spectrographs ( @xmath10 , canon et  al .",
    "2006 ; @xmath11 , ross et  al .",
    "2007b ) . on matching the colour selection between the sdss and 2slaq surveys , the evolution in the luminosity function of lrgs between @xmath12 and @xmath13 is consistent with that expected for a passively evolving stellar population ( wake et  al .",
    "this has implications for the stellar mass assembly of the lrgs , with the bulk of the stellar mass appearing to have been in place a significant period before the lrgs are observed ( wake et  al .",

    "due to their strong clustering amplitude and low space density , lrgs are efficient probes of the large - scale structure of the universe .",

    "( 2006 ) used the observed luminosity function of quasars along with a model for the lifetime of the quasar phase suggested by their numerical simulations to infer the formation history of spheroids , and hence red galaxies .",
    "conroy , ho & white ( 2007 ) use n - body simulations to study the merger histories of the dark matter haloes that they assume host lrgs . using a simple model to assign galaxies to progenitor haloes",
    ", they argue that mergers of lrgs must be very efficient , or that lrgs are tidally disrupted , in order to avoid populating cluster - sized haloes with too many lrgs .",
    "barber et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) used population synthesis models coupled with assumptions about the star formation histories of lrgs to infer the age and metallicity of their stellar populations .    here",
    "we present the first fully consistent predictions for lrgs from hierarchical galaxy formation models , using two published models , namely baugh et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) and bower et  al .",
    "these models , both based on the galform semi - analytical code ( cole et  al .",

    "hence , lrgs can be selected from the model output using the same colour and luminosity criteria that are applied to the real observational data .",
    "the models naturally predict which dark matter haloes host lrgs . as we will see later ,",

    "our aim instead is to test the galaxy formation models , so trying to match the selection to pick out similar objects between the two redshifts is not necessary .",
    "the luminosity function is the most basic description of any galaxy population and is arguably the key hurdle for a model of galaxy formation to negotiate before considering other predictions .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that lrgs represent only a small fraction of the galaxy population as a whole , as can be seen by comparing the integrated space densities quoted in table  1 with the abundance of @xmath0 galaxies , which is around an order of magnitude higher . reproducing",

    ". the sdss catalogue is then cut at @xmath41 and the 2slaq catalogue is cut at @xmath42 .",

    "since the samples are approximately volume - limited it is trivial to produce the luminosity function including a correction for incompleteness in each survey ( see wake et  al .",
    "the integrated number densities of lrgs in the two surveys are listed in table 1 after applying the respective completeness corrections .    in view of the fact that no model parameters have been adjusted in order to `` tune '' the predictions to better match observations of lrgs , both models come surprisingly close to matching the number density of lrgs in the sdss sample , as table  1 shows .",
    "in fact , the baugh et  al .",

    "the comparison with the observational estimate of the luminosity function of lrgs is less impressive .",
    "the baugh et  al .",

    "in this paper we have extended the tests of hierarchical galaxy formation models to include predictions for the properties of a special subset of the galaxy population called luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) . given their rarity , bright luminosities and extreme colours , lrgs represent a stern challenge for the models .",
    "they are particularly interesting from the point of view of developing the model physics , since the abundance and nature of lrgs probes precisely the regime in which the models are currently most uncertain , the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "historically , hierarchical models have tended to overproduce bright galaxies at the present day ( see baugh 2006 ) .",
    "the phenomena invoked to restrict the growth of large galaxies locally , naturally , have an impact on the form of the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function at intermediate and high redshifts , where lrgs dominate . in addition , lrgs have the red colours expected of a passively evolving stellar population , which restricts the range of possible star formation histories for these galaxies",

    "any _ of the parameters of the published models in order to improve the comparison of the model output with the observational data .",
    "this `` warts and all '' exercise illustrates the appeal of the semi - analytical approach , in that a given model yields a broad range of outputs which are directly testable against observations . in both models , lrgs are predominantly bulge dominated galaxies ( although 20 - 40% are expected to be spirals with old stellar populations ) , with velocity dispersions of @xmath52 and stellar masses around @xmath53 , which is higher than observed .",
    "the models give different predictions for the radii of lrgs , with the baugh et  al model predicting the larger lrgs .",

    "models are two feasible simulations of the galaxy formation process , which differ in several ways , as we reviewed in section 2 ( see also the comparison in almeida et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "a key difference between the models , in terms of the analysis presented in this paper , is the form of the physics invoked to quench the formation of massive galaxies . in both models",

    "this gas is assumed to be ejected with such vigour that it does not get recaptured by more massive haloes in the merger hierarchy .",
    "hence , in this model , the more massive haloes contain fewer baryons than expected from the universal baryon fraction , and therefore less gas is available to cool from the hot halo .",
    "one controversial aspect of this scheme is the energy source required to drive the wind .",
    "benson et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the energy produced by supernova explosions is unlikely to be sufficient to power a wind of the strength required to reproduce the sharpness of the break in the local galaxy luminosity function , and argued that the accretion of gas onto a central supermassive black hole could be the solution .",

    "this implies that the models may not be tracking the evolution of the bright end of the luminosity function accurately over such a large lookback time ( 40% of the age of the universe ) , at least for galaxies matching the 2slaq selection .",
    "whilst this discrepancy suggests that there are problems modelling the evolution of the red galaxy luminosity function , it is important to note that the bower et  al .",
    "model does give a good match to the inferred evolution of the stellar mass function , to much higher redshifts than that of the 2slaq sample .",
    "we investigated whether it was possible to tune the predictions of the baugh et  al .",
    "model to better match the lrg luminosity function ; this exercise proved to be unsuccessful suggesting that a more substantial revision to the ingredients of this model , involving further suppression of gas cooling in massive haloes , is required .",
    "semi - analytical models predict the star formation histories of galaxies , based upon the mass of cold gas which accumulates through cooling and galaxy mergers , and a prescription for computing an instantaneous star formation timescale ( examples of star formation histories extracted from the models are given in baugh 2006 ) .",
    "as expected , the stellar populations of model lrgs are old , with luminosity weighted ages in the region of 4 - 8 gyr for the sdss selection , with the bower et  al .",
    "model returning the more elderly stars ( similar results were reported by de lucia et  al .",
    "2006 and croton et  al .",
    "2006 for massive elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "the semi - analytical model can track the build - up of the stellar mass of lrgs , considering all of the progenitor galaxies .",
    "there is little recent star formation in any of the progenitor galaxies of sdss lrgs ; averaging over all progenitors , typically 50% of the @xmath1 stellar mass of the lrg has already formed by a redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "however the mass of the main progenitor branch is still growing over this redshift interval . around half of the mass in the biggest progenitor",
    "is put in place since @xmath7 through galaxy mergers of ready - made stellar fragments ( for a discussion of the difference between the formation time of the stars and the assembly time of the stellar mass , see de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) . on average , only 25% of the stellar mass of the lrg is added after @xmath8 , in line with observational estimates of the evolution of the stellar mass function , which indicate that many of the most massive galaxies are already in place by @xmath8 ( e.g. bauer et  al . 2005",
    "; bundy , ellis & conselice 2005 ; wake et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "perhaps the most spectacularly successful model prediction is for the clustering of lrgs .",
    "masjedi et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated the two - point correlation function of sdss lrgs in real space , free from the distortions in the clustering pattern induced by the peculiar motions of galaxies .",
    "these authors found that the real - space correlation function of lrgs is a power law over three and a half decades in pair separation , down to scales of @xmath54 .",
    "masjedi et  al .",
    "argued that current halo occupation distribution models could not reproduce such a steep correlation function on small scales because these models asume that galaxies trace the density profile of the dark matter halo , which is shallower than the observed correlation function .",
    "this line of reasoning is spurious , as hods can produce realizations of the two - point correlation function with different small - scale slopes for different galaxy samples , even when the different samples trace the dark matter ( see , for example , figure 22 of berlind et  al .",
    "2003 which compares the correlation functions of old and young galaxies ) .",
    "the small scale slope depends on the interplay between two factors : the number of galaxies within a dark matter halo and the range of halo masses which contain more than one galaxy ( e.g. benson et  al .",
    "the bower et  al .",
    "model can readily produce predictions of galaxy clustering down to such small scales since it is embedded in the millennium simulation ( springel et  al .",
    ". the correlation function predicted by the bower et  al .",
    "model agrees impressively well with the observational estimate by masjedi et  al .",
    "the hod used by masjedi et  al .",
    "is actually a poor description of the hod predicted in the bower et  al . model .",
    "further support for the number of lrgs predicted as a function of halo mass comes from the degree of damping of the correlation function seen on small scales in redshift - space .",
    "the virialized motions of lrgs within a common halo gives a contribution to the peculiar velocity of these galaxies , which results in the structure appearing stretched when the distance to the lrg is inferred from its redshift .",
    "this damping would not be apparent in the case of a maximum of one lrg per halo .",
    "overall , the agreement between the model predictions and the observation of lrgs is encouraging , demonstrating the true predictive power of semi - analytical models .",
    "the two models we have tested have quite different mechanisms to regulate the formation of massive galaxies , with the bower et  al . model invoking `` agn feedback '' and the baugh et  al . model relying on a `` superwind '' ; in the former , the raw material for star formation is prevented from cooling in the first place in massive haloes , whilst in the latter cold gas is expelled from the halo before it can form stars .",
    "the bower et  al .",
    "model does the best in terms of matching the abundance of lrgs , particularly at @xmath1 .",
    "this success is repeated for extremely red objects ( eros ) at higher redshifts than the samples considered here , as presented by gonzlez - prez et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the baugh et  al .",
    "model does less well at reproducing the number of lrgs and eros . whilst problems remain in predicting the radii of spheroids and the precise evolution of lrg luminosity function ,",
    "it is clear that these objects can be accommodated in hierarchical models .",
