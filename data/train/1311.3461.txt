    "the recent  observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) lead to a hubble constant of @xmath6 for the base six - parameter @xmath7cdm model ( planck collaboration 2013 , herafter p13 ) .",
    "this value is in tension , at about the @xmath8 level , with the direct measurement of @xmath9 reported by r11 .",
    "if these numbers are taken at face value , they suggest evidence for new physics at about the @xmath8 level ( for example , exotic physics in the neutrino or dark energy sectors as discussed in p13 ; see also wyman 2013 , hamann and hasenkamp 2013 ; battye and moss 2013 ; rest 2013 ; suyu 2013 )",
    ". the exciting possibility of discovering new physics provides strong motivation to subject both the cmb and @xmath1 measurements to intense scrutiny .",
    "direct astrophysical measurements of the hubble constant have a checkered history ( see , for example , the reviews by tammann , sandage and reindl 2008 ; freedman and madore 2010 ) .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project led to a significant improvement in the control of systematic errors leading to ` final ' estimate of @xmath10 ( freedman 2001 ) . since then , two cepheid based programmes have been underway with the aim of reducing the error on @xmath1 : the _ supernovae and @xmath1 for the equation of state _ ( sh0es ) programme of r11 ( with earlier results reported in riess 2009 ) and the _ carnegie hubble program _ of freedman ( 2012 ) . in addition , other programmes are underway using geometrical methods , for example the megamaser cosmology project ( mcp ) ( reid 2013 ; braatz 2013 ) and the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses ( cosmograil ) project ( suyu 2010 , courbin 2011 ; trewes 2013 ) .",
    "this paper presents a reanalysis of the r11 cepheid data .",
    "the @xmath1 measurement from these data has the smallest error and has been used widely in combination with cmb measurements for cosmological parameter analysis ( _ e.g. _ hinshaw 2012 ; hou 2012 ; sievers 2013 ) .",
    "the study reported here was motivated by certain aspects of the r11 analysis : the r11 outlier rejection algorithm ( which rejects a large fraction , @xmath11 , of the cepheids ) , the low reduced @xmath0 values of their fits , and the variations of some of the parameter values with different distance anchors , particularly the metallicity dependence of the period - luminosity relation .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the near - ir period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation of a sample of lmc cepheids . section 3 describes a reanalysis of the r11 sample using the maser distance to ngc 4258 as an anchor .",
    "section 4 investigates the use of the lmc and mw cepheids as anchors .",
    "section 5 investigates combinations of the three distance anchors and presents some internal consistency checks .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "i will start with the lmc cepheids which i will use as a reference since the slope of the p - l relation is tightly constrained from this sample .",
    "i use the 53 lmc cepheids with h - band magnitudes listed in persson ( 2004 ) and v , i magnitudes listed in sebo ( 2002 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the wesenheit magnitudes @xmath12 plotted against period @xmath13 ( in units of days ) .",
    "the line shows a least - squares fit to @xmath14 _ i.e. _ minimising @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the error on @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the ` internal ' scatter that gives a reduced @xmath0 ( denoted @xmath19 in this paper ) of unity . since @xmath18 depends on the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the minimisation is performed iteratively until convergence .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath22 the upper period limit is imposed because there is evidence that the p - l relation departs from a power law for periods @xmath23 days ( persson , 2004 ; freedman 2011 ; scowcroft 2011 ) . the lower period limit in ( [ lmc3b ] ) has been imposed because there have been some claims that the p - l relation at optical and near - ir wavelengths changes at periods less than 10 days ( ngeow 2009 ) .",
    "the results of ( 4a ) and ( 4b ) and figure 1 show no evidence for any significant change in the power - law slope at low periods , in agreement with the results of persson ( 2004 ) .",
    "evidently , a single power law is an extremely good fit to the lmc cepheids at least to periods of 60 days , and the slope of the p - l relation is determined to high accuracy .",
    "as discussed by r11 , there are several reasons to expect outliers in the p - l relation . these include variables misidentified as classical cepheids , blended images , errors in crowding corrections and possible aliasing of the periods .",
    "@xmath24 the h - band only p - l relations are fitted galaxy - by - galaxy to a power law with slope fixed at @xmath25 in the first iteration , weighted by the magnitude errors in table 2 of r11 .",
    "cepheids with periods @xmath26 days are excluded .",
    "once the outliers have been removed , r11 proceed to global fits using all of their galaxies , now adding a @xmath28 mag .",
    "error in quadrature to the magnitude errors listed in their table 2 ( riess , private communication ) .",
    "one of the consequences of adding this additional error term is that the @xmath19 values of the r11 global fits are always less than unity ( with typical values of @xmath29 ) so r11 rescale their covariance matrices by @xmath30 to compute errors on parameters ."
