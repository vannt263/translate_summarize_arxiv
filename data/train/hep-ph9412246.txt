    "hadronic properties at finite temperature and baryon density are of great importance in the phenomenology of heavy ions collisions , star interior and the early universe .",
    "moreover , the theoretical expectation of transitions to a chirally symmetric phase and , perhaps , to a quark - gluon plasma phase contributes to the interest in studying the effect of matter and temperature on the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) vacuum .",
    "our present understanding of qcd at finite temperature ( @xmath0 ) and baryon density ( or chemical potential @xmath1 ) is mainly limited in the euclidean realm , due to the lack of non - perturbative and systematic calculating tools directly in the minkowski space .",
    "typical methods , with qcd lagrangian as the starting point , are the ope and lattice simulations . because these two formulations are intrinsically euclidean , only static quantities are conveniently studied . in order to gain dynamical informations , which are more accessible",
    "experimentally , the analytic structure implemented through dispersion relations often have to be invoked within the theory of linear response .    in principle",
    ", dispersion relations allow the determination of the spectral function ( sf ) , which carries all the real - time information , from the corresponding correlator in the euclidean region . in practice ,",
    "realistic calculations , e.g. ope or lattice simulations , yield only partial information on the correlators , making impossible a direct inversion of the dispersion relation .",
    "therefore , the standard approach assumes a phenomenological motivated functional form with several parameters for the sf , and uses the information from the approximate correlator , mediated by the dispersion relation , only to determine the value of parameters by a fit .",
    "this approach has been quite successful at zero temperature and density , thanks to the fortuitous situation that we roughly know how to parameterize the sf s in many cases .",
    "two important examples are the qcd sum rules pioneered by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov  @xcite , and the analysis of lattice qcd data  @xcite .",
    "so far , standard parameterizations have included poles plus perturbative continuum  @xcite .",
    "the success of such approaches heavily rests on our good understanding of the qualitative behavior of sf s at zero @xmath2 .",
    "we can find other such favorable examples in the low-@xmath0 regime  @xcite , where the shape of the sf has the same qualitatively features of the zero @xmath2 case , or even in the high-@xmath0 regime for simple models  @xcite , for which the functional form of the sf is known .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach has been extended also to systems at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the lack of experimental data , and of reliable nonperturbative calculations has prompted people to use the same kind of parameterizations that have worked so well at zero temperature with , at most , perturbative corrections .",
    "we believe that physical results at finite @xmath2 can be strongly biased by this assumption .",
    "in fact , recent interpretations of lattice simulation data  @xcite appear to indicate the existence of such problems .",
    "the purpose of this work is to derive exact sum rules that constrain the variation of sf s with @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we apply these sum rules to the chiral phase transition , and demonstrate that sf s in some channels are drastically modified compared to both their zero @xmath2 and their perturbative shapes .",
    "this result confirm our worries about non - trivial effect of finite @xmath0 or baryon density on the shape of the sf .",
    "our derivation of these exact sum rules , based on the ope and the rge , has a closer relation with the derivation of sum rules for deep inelastic scatterings than with the qcd sum rule approach of svz  @xcite . in fact",
    ", we establish relationships between moments of the sf and corresponding condensates as functions of @xmath2 , without assuming any functional form of the sf .    in the derivation process",
    ", we find that the logarithmic corrections are essential to establish the exact sum rules .",
    "in contrast , the qcd logarithmic corrections are only marginally relevant in the finite energy sum rules , and hence are rarely discussed in the literature . to properly take into account the logarithmic corrections , a repeated partial integration method is used to match the relevant asymptotic expansions .",
    "since no further assumptions other than the validity of the ope and rge are involved in the derivation , our sum rules are very general and can be applied anywhere in the @xmath2-plane , even near or at the boundary of a phase transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the general derivation of exact sum rules in asymptotically free theories .",
    "the matching of asymptotic behaviors of the correlator and the dispersion integral , including explicitly their logarithmic corrections , are carefully discussed . in section iii",
    "we illustrate each single step of the derivation in a soluble model , the gross - neveu model in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "in this model we can calculate exactly all the relevant quantities ( spectral functions , wilson coefficients , condensates , anomalous dimensions and correlators in space - like region , etc . ) , and , therefore , give a concrete example of how our method works .",
    "the application of our method to the derivation of exact sum rules for the mesonic channels in qcd is presented in section iv . in the same section",
    ", we also discuss the phenomenological consequences of the exact sum rules near chiral restoration phase transitions .",
    "finally , in section v we summarize our work , draw some conclusions , and discuss possible future directions .",
    "we start this section with a short review of the linear response theory , the ope and the rge .",
    "next we introduce a convenient subtraction in the dispersion relation for studying the dependence of sf s on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    then , we present in detail a crucial part of our method : how to match the asymptotic ope expansion with a corresponding asymptotic expansion of the sf and its dispersion integral .",
    "this approach is necessary for properly taking into account the logarithmic corrections , and studying the convergence properties of the relevant moments of the sf .",
    "more naive approaches not only yield , in general , incorrect sum rules , but might also fail to recognize that a given sum rule does not exist in the first place , since the integral of the sf involved is divergent .    finally , a comparison of the two asymptotic expansions leads to the desired exact sum rules .",
    "we end this section with some general comments on the derivation and meaning of these sum rules .",
    "the real - time linear response  @xcite to an external source , @xmath4 , coupled to a renormalized current @xmath5 in the form of @xmath6 is given by the retarded correlator : @xmath7\\rangle_{t,\\mu}\\ , , \\label{corr}\\ ] ] where the average is on the grand canonical ensemble specified by temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "disregarding possible subtraction terms , which are @xmath2-independent since they are related to short distance properties of the theory , we can write the following dispersion relation for the frequency dependence of the retarded correlation function : @xmath8 for convenience , we discuss only the uniform limit ( @xmath9 ) and , from now on , drop the momentum label .",
    "we wish to emphasize that , even if the derivation of the sum rules requires the analytic continuation of eq .",

    "one should keep clearly in mind the distinction between these real - time singularities with the ones related to screening phenomena .      in asymptotically free theories ,",
    "the correlator @xmath12 is calculable in terms of the ope  @xcite asymptotic series in the limit of @xmath13 . for a given renormalization prescription",

    "we explicitly singled out the perturbative term @xmath21 , which corresponds to the identity operator and , being independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is calculated at @xmath22 .",
    "this term is the only one that is not suppressed by powers of @xmath23 and can depend on an overall subtraction scale , which we identify , for simplicity , with the same subtraction scale @xmath19 used in the renormalization of the operators .",
    "it is important to note that the information of the ensemble average is encoded in the matrix elements of composite operators , while the wilson coefficients , including @xmath24 , are independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "although the matrix elements @xmath25_\\kappa\\rangle_{t,\\mu}$ ] can not be determined perturbatively , the @xmath26-dependence of the wilson coefficient @xmath18 is controlled by the following renormalization group equation  @xcite    @xmath27 c_n(q^2,m^2(\\kappa),g^2(\\kappa),\\kappa)=0 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath28 [ rge ]    and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the anomalous dimensions for the current @xmath32 , the operator @xmath33 and the current quark mass @xmath34 respectively . for the purpose of illustration , we are only considering operators that do not mix under renormalization , but the mixing will be properly taken into account when necessary .",
    "the standard approach  @xcite to the renormalization group equation is the introduction of a running coupling @xmath35 and a running mass @xmath36 . in asymptotically free theories @xmath35 vanishes",
    "logarithmically at large @xmath26 .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to consider , in this limit , a perturbative expansion of the renormalization group equation functions @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath34 , while @xmath40 , @xmath41 are pure numbers determined by a one - loop calculation . within this perturbative context , eq .",

    "therefore , the leading term in the large-@xmath26 limit is totally characterized by the one - loop structure of the theory .      to study the temperature and chemical potential dependence of @xmath44 , we only need to consider the difference @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",

    "since the current quark mass only runs logarithmically in asymptotically free theories , we can safely ignore the corrections to the @xmath48 s due to their dependence on @xmath55 when in deep euclidean limit .",
    "notice that the subtraction has made @xmath49 independent of the renormalization point @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath49 satisfies a homogeneous rge .      since @xmath45 is perturbative and hence can be expanded in power of @xmath35 ( and denoting the first non - vanishing power as @xmath56 ) , the left - hand side of eq .",

    "it is important to emphasize here that the leading term in @xmath35 for a given power of @xmath23 is controlled by the relevant anomalous dimensions .",

    "more generally , one could replace @xmath70 with the full running coupling @xmath71 in the asymptotic sequence and generalize the method we are going to describe ; the general strategy involved in this generalization can be found , for example , in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since we are presently only interested in one - loop calculations , we can regard @xmath35 and @xmath72 to be proportional .",
    "it is easy to recognize that the sum over `` @xmath39 '' is meant to match the sum over mass dimension in eq .",
    "( [ asyope ] ) , while the sum over `` @xmath73 '' will match the sum over the order in perturbation series .",
    "the existence of anomalous dimensions in the ope makes it necessary to introduce @xmath74 in the expansion for the spectral function . in the following",
    "we ignore the dependence of @xmath74 on `` @xmath39 '' , as we have already ignored the fact that there generally exist more than one operator at a given dimension , and write @xmath75 to avoid a too cumbersome notation .",
    "the complete notation will be restored when necessary .",
    "before we proceed further , we wish to discuss whether it is possible that additional terms might appear in the expansion of @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ rholn ] ) .",
    "in general , our asymptotic expansion procedure is powerful enough to exclude this possibility within the framework of the ope .",
    "in fact , it allows to verify unambiguously that terms different from the ones already present generate , when substituted in the dispersion integral , terms that are missing in the ope .",
    "let us examine two specific examples that might be suspected to exist otherwise .",
    "first , dimensional arguments could suggest terms like @xmath77 .",
    "our procedure shows that any @xmath78 term in @xmath60 would generate a @xmath79 term in @xmath49 , which does not correspond to any known condensate , and it is therefore excluded .",
    "the second example is given by terms such as @xmath80 , which are naturally produced by elementary perturbative calculations of the spectral function : are such terms present in eq .",
    "( [ rholn ] ) ?",
    "it is indeed true that such terms appear in the high-@xmath0 expansion of the spectral function at fixed @xmath81 .",
    "however , the expansion of the spectral function that is relevant for comparing to the ope is a high-@xmath81 expansion at fixed @xmath0 . in the next section an explicit calculation in the gross - neveu model",
    "will illustrate the general fact that , contrary to the high-@xmath0 expansion , the high-@xmath81 expansion does not generate terms like @xmath80 .    at this stage , we can already recognize a fundamental , and often overlooked , characteristic of the spectral function .",
    "if we insert the term @xmath65 in the dispersion integral , we only obtain pure powers of @xmath23 , since the exponential convergence allows a naive expansion of the factor @xmath82 ( watson s lemma  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore logarithmic corrections , i.e. powers of @xmath35 , come solely from the @xmath76 term . because we know that the running coupling @xmath35 is always present in the ope series , the term @xmath76 must be present in the subtracted sf , and it obviously dominates the asymptotic regime ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this fact immediately implies that only a finite number of moments of the subtracted sf can possibly be finite , i.e. the naive expansion of the factor @xmath82 is generally wrong , and that logarithmic corrections play a important role .    a standard method to tackle the dispersion integral in the large-@xmath26 limit is the mellin transform .",
    "however , the use of mellin transform methods  @xcite is extremely cumbersome when logarithms appear in the denominator .",
    "since inverse logarithms can not be avoided in the spectral function , we need to resort to other means .",
    "we carry out the dispersion integral of the @xmath76 term by splitting the integral in eq .",

    "but these exact sum rules are not explicitly affected by this problem , although the value of the condensates certainly have instanton contributions .",
    "the reason is that the instanton singularities in the borel - plane are located on the positive axis starting at @xmath303 , which in turn implies that the explicit contribution of instantons to correlation functions are of higher order than @xmath23  @xcite in the ope series .",
    "finally , let us discuss some of the phenomenological consequences of these exact sum rules .",
    "the power of these exact sum rules rests on their generality , in the sense that there is no assumptions on the functional form of the sf s and they can be applied anywhere in the @xmath2-plane .",
    "first let us consider the pseudoscalar channel .",
    "the sum rule @xmath215 implies that , in the broken - chiral - symmetry phase , the change of the pion pole induced by @xmath0 or @xmath1 is exactly compensated by a corresponding change of the continuum part of the sf .",

    "the divergence of the chiral susceptibility near the phase transition can only be produced in eq .",
    "( [ chisus ] ) by singularities very close to the origin ; singularities not near the origin are not compatible with the sum rule @xmath215 .",
    "thus , when approaching the phase boundary in the @xmath2 plane , the threshold of the spectral function vanishes ( since there is no massless pole in the chirally symmetric phase ) , and a strong peak develops right above threshold . in the chirally symmetric phase",
    "the pseudoscalar and scalar channels are degenerate , therefore we expect the same behavior for the pseudoscalar sf .",
    "this strong peak in the pseudoscalar and scalar sf s , which is intimately connected with critical phenomena of a diverging susceptibility and correlation length near the phase transition , can be interpreted as some kind of quasi - particle , thus confirming the qualitative picture , originally proposed in the context of the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite , of the appearance of soft modes near the chiral phase transition .",
    "we wish to remark that the sum rule has been used only to exclude the logical possibility of the sf developing singularities at finite energies .",
    "but the sum rule is not a necessary condition for the appearance of a peak .",
    "the presence of a second order phase transition ( infinite correlation length ) is the real physical cause of the peak .",
    "nevertheless , one should not assume that if the phase transition is not second order the zero-@xmath0 or perturbative spectral function is a good approximation to the real spectral function .",
    "even if the chiral restoration turns out to be a cross - over or weak first order transition ( finite but large correlation ) , as the lattice data seem to indicate  @xcite , we still expect the same qualitative features , though less pronounced : a peak develops but it does not actually diverge at the transition . our calculation in the gross - neveu model is a clear illustration of this situation . while fig .",

    "this problem is not very serious , since we only need that @xmath113 is not singular crossing the phase boundary . and",
    "this can still be argued by means of the sum rule in eq .",
    "( [ va ] ) and the fact that , for a continuous phase transition , the changes of the thermal energy @xmath306\\rangle$ ] , and of both condensates @xmath307\\rangle$ ] and @xmath308\\rangle$ ] should behave smoothly across the critical line .",
    "the most serious difference is that , in these channels , we can not argue on physical grounds that the corresponding susceptibility diverges . nonetheless , there exist lattice simulations  @xcite showing that the so - called quark number susceptibility rapidly increases in the transition .",
    "thus it is plausible that also in the vector channel the sf has a vanishing threshold , and accumulates strength just above it .",
    "a similar argument in the context of the nambu - jona - lasinio model can be found in ref .",
    "we used the operator product expansion and the renormalization group equation to derive exact sum rules at finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 valid for asymptotically free theories .",
    "our derivation explicitly show that logarithmic corrections can not be neglected .",
    "we found that , depending on the theory and on the current under study , the zeroth moment of a spectral function is either independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , or its change is related to the corresponding changes of the condensates of operators of lowest dimension .",
    "in particular the zeroth moment of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesonic currents in qcd are independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as a consequence",
    "any change in the strength of the pion pole must be exactly compensated by a change in the continuum contribution .",
    "we also infer that spectral functions in the scalar and pseudoscalar channel should dramatically change near phase transition .",
    "we also find that the zeroth moment of the vector and axial - vector mesonic currents in qcd changes with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and these changes are related to the corresponding changes of the condensates .",
    "due to their generality , these exact sum rules strongly constrain the qualitative shape of sf s , in particular , near phase transitions . since it appears that a strong deformation of the spectral function from its counter part at @xmath22 and perturbative cases is the most likely scenario near phase transitions , the information carried by these exact sum rules is particularly welcome .",
    "we urge whoever parameterizes a spectral function , e.g. in qcd sum rule type of calculations or to interpret lattice simulation data , to incorporate these exact constraints .",
    "we have also illustrated in great detail the derivation of the sum rules , and confirmed their validity , in the gross - neveu model , where we can also calculate the exact spectral function . even if this model calculation is meant mostly as an illustration of many delicate issues of the derivation ( such as convergence , asymptotic expansion , mellin transform , high momentum expansion vs. high temperature expansion , etc . ) , it is nevertheless comforting to find that all our general expectations about the spectral function are explicitly verified in the model ."
