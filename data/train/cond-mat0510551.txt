    "it has been shown that gentle mechanical impulses  @xcite can be used to detect buried objects at depths of a meter or so in nominally dry sand beds .",
    "imaging requires the understanding of pulse propagation in nonlinear media . besides the underlying non - linearity due to the hertzian contact forces between the grains ( see , for example , @xcite ) ,",

    "the increase is linear for non - zero @xmath0 whereas it only approaches linear for @xmath31 in the later stages .",
    "the steps in @xmath30  indicate the arrival of peaks with the quiescent period in between marked by plateaus ; the length of the plateau indicates the time period between peaks .",
    "the pattern of arrival of large peaks introduce modulations in the amplitudes of @xmath40 . nevertheless , there are no simple patterns in the distribution of peaks of @xmath40 vs. @xmath33 in figs .",
    "[ bcksc](_a_-_d _ ) .",
    "we note that the boundary conditions affect @xmath40 .",
    "a possible modulating mechanism could be due to the center of mass ( com ) oscillations of the system .",
    "we show these oscillations ( the breathing  of the chain ) in the third row of fig .",
    "[ bcksc ] for three typical cases . with @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ bcksc](_g _ ) ) , the significant com oscillations appear only after the solitary waves have broken down . for non - zero @xmath0 ,",

    "[ bcksc](_i _ )  is typical of open boundary conditions at the top ( in this case , @xmath3 ) .",
    "we now turn to the toy model to see whether these patterns in @xmath40  can be reproduced .",
    "we had introduced a toy model in an earlier paper where the energy propagation in a vertical alignment of masses was considered in a simplified manner  @xcite . at time @xmath43 , we set initial energy @xmath44 for layer one and zero for the rest . at @xmath45 , the first layer in the vertical chain transfers @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) of the impulse energy to the second layer , and retains @xmath48 .",
    "at subsequent times , the impulse will propagate in the same fashion all the way down the chain .",
    "after each transfer of energy , the phase of the mass reverses so that it will interact with its adjacent layer in the opposite direction in the following time step .",
    "the interaction between two adjacent layers occurs in the following two ways : ( i ) _ equipartition _ case , and ( ii ) _ exchange _ case . in the _ equipartition _",
    "case , the two interacting layers will come away from the interaction with equal amounts of energy ; we add up the individual energies of the two layers and divide the sum equally between them . in the _ exchange _ case , we let the layers exchange their energies ; the two interacting layers , after the interaction , come away with the energy of the other .",

    "[ fig3](_b _ )  for the case , similarly , with equipartition center at particle no .",
    "350 ; the exchange coefficient @xmath49 .",

    "our goal is to develop the propagation patterns seen in figs .",
    "[ bcksc](_b_-_d _ ) .",
    "the model is based on the exchange case , but we allow equipartition centers to develop , as time goes by , at different points in the chain . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](_a _ ) , we have shown a case where a single equipartition center is kept fixed at layer number 200 in a chain of 500 layers . fig .",
    "[ fig3](_b _ )  is for a similar case but with the equipartition center located at layer number 350 .",
    "we see that the patterns in @xmath40  do change slightly depending on the location of the isolated equipartition center , but , in both cases , it is seen that the patterns are broadly similar to the non - zero @xmath0 cases seen in figs .",
    "[ bcksc](_b_)-(_d _ ) .    this has prompted us to try averaging over the patterns resulting from differing locations of the isolated equipartition centers and , indeed , the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3](_c _ )  shows that such averaging does retain the similarity with plots of figs .",
    "[ bcksc](_b_)-(_d _ ) . to obtain this figure , we averaged over , along with the cases given in fig .",
    "[ fig3](_a _ )  and fig .",
    "[ fig3](_b _ ) , two other cases with isolated equipartition centers , in each case , located at layer numbers 300 and 390 respectively .",
    "if we vary the exchange coefficient @xmath46 , we get similar patterns ( not shown here ) but with the difference that the growth in @xmath30  is proportional to the @xmath46 value .",
    "this indicates that @xmath46 could also be used , along with the equipartition centers , to capture the transition from ballistic propagation to acoustic propagation . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](_d _ ) , we show results with multiple ( three , in this cases ) equipartition centers in the system , at layer numbers 125 , 230 and 390 ; @xmath49 for this case .",
    "we see that @xmath30  grows by as much as in figs .",
    "[ fig3](_a_)-(_c _ )  but the attenuation in peaks of @xmath40  is very pronounced and similar to the pattern seen in fig .",
    "[ bcksc](_d _ ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the problem of impulse propagation in a gravitationally loaded granular chain .",
    "we have focused our attention on the backscattered energy received at the surface after an impulse has been initiated into the system .",
    "our studies have been carried out using two different approaches ( i ) using newtonian dynamics in a non - disspative system to describe backscattering at the surface of the system and , ( ii ) using the toy model @xcite to recover the behavior in ( i ) .",
    "our results show that the toy model is capable of reproducing the correct form of the backscattered energy as a function of time in a gravitationally loaded chain .",
    "gravitational loading introduces acoustic - like oscillations in the system .",
    "such oscillations vanish and the system ends up propagating solitary waves when gravitational loading is zero . to achieve these descriptions , one must generalize the earlier version of the toy model @xcite and incorporate both exchange ( represents non - linear ) and equipartition ( represents acoustic ) effects .",
    "we find that the role of the equipartition ( acoustic ) effect in the toy model is rather dominant and only limited equipartitioning of energy gives the correct backscattering behavior .",
    "our studies confirm that mechanical propagation in a granular chain is strongly nonlinear even in the presence of gravitational loading .",
