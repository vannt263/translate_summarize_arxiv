    "for the first time i met wolfgang kummer in 1992 .",
    "it happened on my way back from italy to st.petersburg . at that time , a hundred of us dollars was a fortune in russia .",
    "therefore , to save money i took a train going through vienna , and not a plane flying over it .",
    "the most natural decision was to stop in vienna for a couple of days and give a seminar at tu .",
    "this is how one of the most fruitful and exciting collaborations in my life started , and this is also a very rare example of a positive effect of severe financial difficulties .",
    "the vienna school of 2d gravity was an amazingly successful project , see @xcite . to keep it running ,",
    "new interesting directions of research were always needed .",
    "about 2005 i told wolfgang about my recent work on noncommutative ( nc ) gravity in two dimensions @xcite which almost literally repeated some of the steps done previously in the commutative case .",
    "we decided to return to this after completing our current work .",
    "unfortunately , deteriorating health did not allow wolfgang to take up this job .",
    "this short article is a kind of a proposal for a `` vienna - style '' nc gravity .",
    "this is not a ( mini)review , with most visible consequence that the literature is incomplete .",
    "i am asking all authors whose papers will not be mentioned for understanding . for a systematic overview of nc gravities",
    "the reader may consult the paper by szabo@xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the desire to construct an nc gravity is very natural .",
    "one of the main arguments in favor of noncommutativity comes from gravity@xcite .",
    "particular ways to realize noncommutativity differ much from model to model .    to stay closer to vienna ,",
    "whenever possible , i will discuss noncommutative counterparts of dilaton gravities in two dimensions ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) . in the commutative case",
    ", the classical first - order action reads @xmath1\\,,\\label{1st}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a lorentz index , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the zweibein and connection one - forms respectively , @xmath5 is a volume two - form , @xmath6 is the dilaton , and @xmath7 is an auxiliary field which generates the torsion constraint .",
    "@xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the christoffel symbol .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are two arbitrary functions called the dilaton potentials . with the choice @xmath12 , @xmath13 one obtains the jackiw - teitelboim model@xcite .",
    "other choices reproduce all gravity models in two dimensions , see ref.@xcite .      in principle , any theory containing some effects of noncommutativity of the coordinates and looking more or less like a gravity theory may be called a noncommutative gravity .",
    "the problem is that the people working on a particular approach are ( naturally ) more enthusiastic about it than the rest of the community .",
    "therefore , i asked myself , what kind of noncommutative gravity theory could have a chance to satisfy wolfgang ?",
    "an answer to this question seems to be a rather strict point of view on nc gravity .    to construct a gravity one first needs a manifold . nc manifolds may be understood through the gelfand - naimark duality . to a manifold @xmath14",
    "one can associate a commutative associative algebra @xmath15 of smooth functions . under certain restrictions ,",
    "each commutative associative algebra is an algebra of smooth functions on some manifold . in this sense , an algebra @xmath16 , which is a noncommutative associative deformation of @xmath15 defines an nc deformation of @xmath14 .",
    "most conveniently the deformation is done by replacing the point - wise product @xmath17 by a noncommutative star product @xmath18 , which can be presented as @xmath19 because of the associativity , @xmath20 is a poisson bivector , i.e. it has to satisfy the jacobi identity .",
    "note , that in two dimensions the jacobi identity is satisfied any antisymmetric tensor @xmath21 .",
    "next , one has to satisfy the relativity principle , i.e. , one should realize the group of diffeomorphisms ( or a deformation of this group ) on an nc manifold .",
    "then one has to construct invariants which in the commutative limit @xmath24 reproduce the einstein - hilbert action coupled to matter fields .",
    "this program , upon completion , should give an nc gravity .",
    "these are approaches which are not even trying to construct a full nc gravity but instead focus on some selected features of nc theories . for example , in one of such approaches , reviewed in ref.@xcite , the nonlocality , which is a characteristic feature of nc theories , is modelled by delocalization of sources in otherwise commutative theories .",
    "such approaches are very useful in one wishes to understand what kind of physical effects may follow from the noncommutativity , but they are not designed to check theoretical consistency .      in 1999",
    "seiberg and witten @xcite discovered a map between commutative and noncommutative gauge theories . due to this map , gauge symmetries , including diffeomorphisms , can be realized by standard commutative transformations on commutative fields .",
    "the nc fields are expressed through power series in @xmath22 with growing number of commutative fields and their derivatives .",
    "this map was applied also to gravity , and even some physical effects were studied , see e.g. @xcite . with higher orders of @xmath22 technical difficulties in applying the seiberg - witten map grow fast ,",
    "so that no one was able to go beyond the second order .",
    "because of this , this method can hardly be considered as an ultimate solution of the problem of constructing an nc gravity , but it gives a very valuable information : the statement that such a theory does exist at least in the form of power series .",
    "looking at the formula ( [ moyal ] ) one immediately sees a source of the problems with the diffeomorphisms : @xmath20 looks as a tensor , but the formula ( [ moyal ] ) is not tensorial .",
    "then , it is natural to assume that the things become easier with the part of the diffeomorphisms group which does not change @xmath22 . for a non - degenerate @xmath20 these diffeomorphisms ( symplectomorphisms )",
    "are generated by vector fields of the form @xmath25 such diffeomorphisms preserve also the volume element , and thus we are dealing with unimodular gravity theories .",
    "nc theories based on gauging symplectic diffeomorphisms were indeed constricted @xcite and gave rise to many interesting results .",
    "though in our rather strict approach to nc gravities this group looks too small , we again receive an important message that a consistent nc theory may be constructed at least with this small part .",
    "the action of a yang - mills gauge transformation can easily be extended to a noncommutative case .",
    "let in a commutative theory @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a field transformed according to a finite dimensional representation @xmath28 of the symmetry algebra . then in an nc case one can define @xmath29 .",
    "a problem appears with commutators .",
    "let @xmath30 be a basis in the lie algebra taken in the representation @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath31_\\star}^\\star \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\alpha,\\beta]_\\star = \\frac 12 [ t^a , t^b ] ( \\alpha_a \\star \\beta_b + \\beta_b \\star \\alpha_a ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad + \\frac 12 \\ { t^a , t^b\\ }   ( \\alpha_a \\star \\beta_b - \\beta_b \\star \\alpha_a ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression on the right hand side of the last line is a gauge generator if both commutator @xmath32 $ ] and anticommutator @xmath33 belong to the lie algebra .",
    "this imposes severe restrictions on possible gauge groups and their representations@xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath34 can not be extended to nc spaces , while @xmath35 can .",
    "one can demonstrate , that with the choice of the potentials @xmath12 , @xmath13 corresponding to the jackiw - teitelboim model@xcite is equivalent to an @xmath36 bf theory . consequently , extending this symmetry to an nc @xmath37 one can construct an nc version of the jt gravity@xcite .",
    "the model appears to be both classical@xcite and quantum@xcite integrable .",
    "of course , by extending the gauge symmetry one introduces a new gauge field , which , however , decouples in the commutative limit and does not lead to any contradictions .",
    "however , there is a different problem with this approach .",
    "one can not deform the linear dilaton potential @xmath11 by adding higher powers of the dilaton and preserving the number of nc gauge symmetries@xcite .",
    "this means that other interesting dilaton gravity models can not be constructed in this approach .",
    "practically all symmetries of commutative theories can be realized on a noncommutative space as _ twisted _ symmetries .",
    "the twisting is based on an observation that the moyal product ( [ moyal ] ) can be represented as a composition of the point - wise product and a drinfeld twist .",
    "indeed , the point - wise product @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the moyal product @xmath40 , @xmath41 are related through @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a twist .    the way how the symmetry generators act on tensor products",
    "is defined by the coproduct @xmath44 . in commutative field theories",
    "one uses a primitive coproduct @xmath45 , so that we have the usual leibniz rule @xmath46      the action of a generator @xmath48 on the star - product of fields is defined as follows @xmath49 twisting , in a sense , pushes the symmetry generator through the star product .",
    "this makes it possible to define symmetry transformations without transforming the star product . in algebraic language",
    ", we have a hopf algebra symmetry instead of a lie algebra one .",
    "the literature on twisted symmetries is very large .",
    "we like to mention an early paper by oeckl@xcite .",
    "the symmetries relevant for our discussion are the poincare symmetry@xcite ( this was the first symmetry to be twisted ) , diffeomorphisms@xcite , and gauge symmetries@xcite .",
    "moreover , the twist interpretation may be given to some star products other than the moyal one .",
    "the twisted symmetries are not _ bona fide _ physical symmetries .",
    "one can not use them , for example , to gauge away any degrees of freedom .",
    "the problem of proper interpretation of twisted local symmetries remains .",
    "one possible interpretation is as follows @xcite .",
    "let us replace the partial derivatives @xmath50 in ( [ moyal ] ) and ( [ twop ] ) with covariant derivatives @xmath51 with a trivial connection .",
    "since @xmath52 commute , the new star product will be again associative .",
    "( for non - commuting @xmath51 the associativity is violated @xcite ) .",
    "if the original theory were twisted gauge invariant , the theory with this new star product will be both twisted gauge invariant and gauge invariant in the ordinary sense . to return back , one has to fix the gauge @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , twisted gauge invariance is a remnant of ordinary gauge invariance after fixing the gauge by imposing a condition on gauge - trivial covariant derivatives appearing inside the star product .      a unifying approach to describe _ any _ nc geometry was introduced by connes@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "it is based on the notion of a spectral triple @xmath54 consisting of an associative algebra @xmath16 represented by bounded operators on a hilbert space @xmath55 and a dirac operator @xmath56 acting on @xmath55 .",
    "these three object satisfy certain relations and restrictions .",
    "as soon as a spectral triple is defined , the corresponding classical action follows from the so - called spectral action principle@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a positive even function , and @xmath59 is a scale parameter .",
    "all unitary symmetries of the operator @xmath56 are inherited by the spectral action . as an expansion in @xmath59 the action ( [ spec ] )",
    "may be calculated by the heat kernel methods .",
    "on moyal spaces such methods are rather well developed @xcite .",
    "the problem is `` only '' to find a corresponding spectral triple .",
    "as we have seen above , rigidity of @xmath20 under the diffeomorphism transformations creates a lot of problems .",
    "it may be a good idea to transform both @xmath20 and the star product under the diffeomorphisms .",
    "to this end , we need general star products .    the modern history of deformation quantization started with the papers @xcite .",
    "the main part of the deformation - quantization program is a construction of a star product for a given poisson structure @xmath21 . for symplectic manifolds ( non - degenerate @xmath20 )",
    "the existence of a start product was demonstrated by de wilde and lecomte@xcite , and a very elegant construction was given by fedosov@xcite .",
    "for generic poisson structure the existence of a star product was demonstrated by kontsevich @xcite who also gave an explicit formula ( which is , however , too complicated to be used for actual calculations of higher orders in the star product ) .",
    "such orders of the star product were computed by using the weyl map and a representation of noncommutative coordinates in the form of differential operators@xcite .",
    "a very promising non - perturbative formula for the star product was suggested by cattaneo and felder @xcite .",
    "they took a poisson sigma model with the action @xmath60 \\label{psm}\\ ] ] defined on a two - dimensional manifold . @xmath6 and @xmath16 are the fields on this manifold , which are a zero - form taking values in a poisson manifold and a one - form with values in the cotangent space to this manifold , respectively .",
    "the two - dimensional world - sheet is supposed to be a disc ( with suitable boundary conditions imposed on @xmath16 ) .",
    "three distinct points on the boundary of the disc are selected , denoted @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the star product is then given by a correlation function @xmath64 where the integration is restricted by the condition @xmath65 .",
    "the main advantage of this formula is that it does not imply any expansion in @xmath22 .",
    "what is then the relation to two - dimensional dilaton gravities ?",
    "the point is that the poisson sigma models were originally introduced@xcite as generalizations of the dilaton gravity action ( [ 1st ] ) . indeed , by identifying @xmath66 with @xmath67 , and @xmath68 with @xmath69 and making a suitable choice of @xmath70 one can reduce ( [ psm ] ) to ( [ 1st ] ) .",
    "in the context of two - dimensional gravities rather powerful methods of calculation of the path integral were developed@xcite .",
    "at least some of these methods work also for generic poisson sigma models@xcite .",
    "the approach@xcite was specially tailored to study quantum gravity phenomena , like virtual black holes , and not the correlation functions of the type ( [ cfstar ] ) .",
    "however , some steps to adjust that methods to the new tasks have already been done .",
    "for example , inclusion of boundaries was considered in a paper@xcite , which was the last publication of wolfgang kummer .",
    "as we have seen , there are many rather successful approaches to nc gravity .",
    "one can be optimistic , that soon an nc gravity satisfying our ( perhaps , too strict ) criteria will be formulated .",
    "it is likely , that 2d dilaton gravities will play a prominent role in this process .",
