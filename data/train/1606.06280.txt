    "the environment where galaxies reside have a strong influence on their physical properties @xcite , related to their structure and star formation activity . in a color - magnitude ( or color - mass ) diagram",
    "we can broadly classify local galaxies in two main types . in such diagrams most galaxies",
    "are found in two regions , called `` blue cloud '' ( bc ) and `` red sequence '' ( rs ) .",
    "the former is mainly composed by late - type galaxies , blue spirals , with high star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the latter comprises early - types , elliptical and s0 galaxies , which are redder , bulge - dominated and with negligible star formation .",
    "galaxies are believed to migrate from the bc to the rs passing through a region with low number density of galaxies , known as the `` green valley '' ( gv , @xcite ) .",
    "gv galaxies are considered a transitory population between the bc and rs @xcite . galaxies in this region define this low number density `` valley '' because they are undergoing a rapid evolution phase , when their star - formation is being quenched @xcite .",
    "the subject of transitional galaxy types has already been investigated for a few decades .",
    "for instance , some well known transitional objects are the post - starburst ( `` e+a '' ) galaxies @xcite . and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "more recently , several studies in the literature aim to investigate the properties and evolution of different transitional populations .",
    "@xcite investigated the properties of optically passive spirals in the cluster a901/2 ; @xcite investigated rs galaxies with residual star formation in massive nearby clusters ; @xcite studied recently quenched elliptical galaxies ( rqes ) in the local universe ; @xcite present evidence of different star formation histories of gv objects ; and @xcite investigate the nature of gv and luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) and their relation to bc and rs objects .",
    "galaxy stellar population properties also show a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass @xcite . on average , high mass galaxies formed most of their stars at earlier epochs and in a much shorter time scale than lower mass systems .",
    "that effect is called downsizing @xcite .",
    "disentangling the importance of environment and stellar mass , and even galaxy morphology , is a hard task .",
    "currently , there is still a debate if the environmental dependence could simply be the result of different mass and/or morphological distributions with environment . in general , different studies",
    "indicate that both galaxy mass and environment are important . at least on what regards quenching , the environment is more relevant for lower mass objects @xcite . in a recent study @xcite verify that current morphology is correlated to the star formation activity , but is not important for the stellar history .",
    "they also find the average star formation history ( sfh ) depends on galaxy mass , but at fixed mass the sfh depends on the environment .",
    "this work is the fifth of a series aiming to investigate cluster and galaxies properties at low redshifts ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "our main goal is to study transitional galaxy populations characterizing their main properties in different environments , from the extreme field to the central parts of groups / clusters .",
    "for that purpose we separate our galaxy sample in four galaxy populations , two representing the `` normal '' galaxy bimodal distribution found in the local universe , and two associated to intermediate types or galaxies in transition . in a similar way to what has been done by @xcite",
    "we simply consider photometric derived parameters for that separation . in our case",
    ", we use the ( u - r ) color and the concentration index ( @xmath4 ) . according to these parameters we separate the sample , calling the `` normal '' galaxies as `` red bulges '' and `` blue discs '' , and the transitional types as `` red discs '' and `` blue bulges '' .",
    "we compare several physical properties ( such as age , metallicity , sfr , and stellar mass ) of these four classes below , as well as their environmental variation from the field to clusters .",
    "the analysis is based on two complementary luminosity ranges ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 is the characteristic magnitude of the luminosity function in the @xmath8band .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : @xmath92 has the data description , where we also discuss the field sample , the local galaxy density estimates , the stellar population properties from different codes , visual morphologies , and the separation of the galaxy populations .",
    "in @xmath93 we present the environmental variation of the transitional galaxy populations . in @xmath94 , to better characterize the samples , we compare physical properties and environmental parameters of the four galaxy populations .",
    "in @xmath95 we try to disentangle the importance of stellar mass and environment ( local and global ) for the galaxy populations .",
    "we also try to understand the nature of the transitional populations from their inspection in the @xmath10m@xmath3 , age@xmath2m@xmath3 and ssfr@xmath2m@xmath3 planes , and the analysis of their star formation histories ( sfh ) .",
    "in @xmath96 we have a discussion on the quenching time of the `` blue disc '' population and on the nature of the transitional objects .",
    "we summarize our main results in @xmath97 .",
    "the cosmology assumed in this work considers",
    "@xmath110.3 , @xmath120.7 , and h@xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 mpc@xmath17 , with @xmath14 set to 0.7 . for simplicity , in the following we are going to use the term `` cluster '' to refer loosely to groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "this work is based on photometric and spectroscopic data from the sdss , as well as wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) photometry . in what follows",
    "we describe the cluster and field samples , and the main properties of the galaxy data we use .      in the first paper of this series ( hereafter paper i , @xcite ) we defined a cluster sample from the supplemental version of the northern sky optical cluster survey ( nosocs , @xcite ) . for",
    "that we used data from the 5th sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) release , from which we re - estimated photometric redshifts as in @xcite .",
    "this sample comprises 7,414 systems well sampled in sdss dr5 ( details in paper i ) .",
    "nosocs has its origin on the digitized version of the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii ; dposs , @xcite ) . in @xcite and @xcite the photometric calibration and object classification for dposs , respectively ,",
    "are described . the supplemental version of nosocs @xcite goes deeper ( @xmath18 ) , but covers a smaller region than the main nosocs catalog @xcite .",
    "for a subset of the 7,414 nosocs systems with sdss data we extracted a subsample of low redshift galaxy clusters ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this subsample comprises 127 clusters , for which we had enough spectra in sdss for spectroscopic redshift determination , as well as to select cluster members and perform a virial analysis , obtaining estimates of velocity dispersion , physical radius and mass ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; details in paper i ) .",
    "this low - redshift sample was complemented with more massive systems from the cluster infall regions in sdss ( cirs ) sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "cirs is a collection of @xmath19 x - ray selected clusters overlapping the sdss dr4 footprint .",
    "the same cluster parameters listed above were determined for these 56 cirs clusters .    in the second paper of this series ( hereafter paper ii , @xcite ) we investigated the scaling relations of clusters using this combined sample of 183 clusters at @xmath19 , except for three systems that are not used for having biased values of @xmath20 and mass due to projection effects .",
    "for the clusters with at least five galaxy members within r@xmath25 we also have a substructure estimate , based on the ds , or @xmath26 test @xcite .",
    "details about this low - redshift sample and the estimates obtained for the clusters can be found in papers i and ii .",
    "the redshift limit of the sample ( @xmath27 ) is due to incompleteness in the sdss spectroscopic survey for higher redshifts , where galaxies fainter than @xmath28 are missed , biasing the dynamical analysis ( see discussion in section 4.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "we eliminated interlopers using the `` shifting gapper '' technique @xcite , applied to all galaxies with spectra available within a maximum aperture of 2.50 h@xmath17 mpc .",
    "we also estimated x - ray luminosity ( @xmath29 , using rosat all sky survey data ) , optical luminosity ( @xmath30 ) and richness ( n@xmath31 , @xcite ) .",
    "the centroid of each nosocs cluster is a luminosity weighted estimate , which correlates well with the x - ray peak ( see @xcite ) .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper iii )",
    "we investigated the connection between galaxy evolution and the dynamical state of galaxy clusters , indicated by their velocity distributions . in @xcite ( hereafter paper iv )",
    "we investigate the role of environment from the field , through the outer regions of clusters and their cores . in a forthcoming paper ( rembold , ribeiro & lopes )",
    "we will study the properties of brightest cluster galaxies and their connection to the parent clusters . here",
    "we focus on the investigation of the properties of transitional galaxies ( such as metallicity , l@xmath32 , and star formation rate ) , and their relations with the environment and stellar mass .",
    "note that for the cluster regions we only use galaxies that are selected as cluster members by the `` shifting gapper '' technique .",
    "a control field sample is described below .    in @xcite",
    "we implemented one modification to the `` shifting gapper '' technique , that resulted in the exclusion of a few lower mass systems ( details in paper iv ) . due to",
    "that our final sample comprises 152 groups and clusters , for which we have 6,415 galaxies , being 5,106 with @xmath5 ( from clusters at @xmath19 ) and 1,309 galaxies with @xmath6 ( from objects at @xmath33 ) .",
    "our clusters span the range",
    "@xmath34 km s@xmath17 , or the equivalently in terms of mass , @xmath35 .",
    "in that fourth paper we had investigated the role of environment beyond the extent of galaxy clusters , corroborating a scenario on which pre - processing in groups leads to a strong evolution in galaxy properties , before they are accreted by large clusters .",
    "this final galaxy sample , the cluster properties derived above , the density estimates and the field data , were all based on the sdss dr7 .",
    "the galaxy field sample is constructed as follows . from the whole dr7 data set we select galaxies that would not be associated to a group or cluster , considering the cluster catalog from @xcite . to be conservative , we consider a galaxy to belong to the _ field _ if it is not found within 4.0 mpc and not having a redshift offset smaller than 0.06 of any cluster from @xcite .",
    "we select more than 60,000 field galaxies , but work with a smaller subset ( randomly chosen ) for which we derived local density estimates .",
    "in the end we use 2,936 field galaxies at @xmath36 0.100 with @xmath5 , and 1,740 at @xmath36 0.045 with @xmath6 ( the same order of cluster galaxies ) .",
    "for these objects we compute density estimates ( see below ) in the same way as done for the cluster members .",
    "note this field sample is based on a comparison to one cluster catalog @xcite .",
    "as any other cluster catalog , the one from @xcite is complete for rich systems , but not for the smaller mass groups and clusters . even if we were using all group and cluster catalogs available in the literature we would still be incomplete for low mass systems .",
    "due to that we may select galaxies as field objects which may actually belong to small groups .",
    "their local densities will then be high ( see for instance figs .",
    "[ fig : denbins2 ] and [ fig : denbinsb2 ] below , or figs . 3 and 4 of @xcite )",
    ", with typical values log @xmath37 .",
    "however , the number of objects in this case is not large ( as can be seen by the `` scale '' represented by the error bars in these figures ) , and we decided to leave them in the field sample , instead of making an arbitrary cut in @xmath38 .",
    "another reason explaining these cases is the fact that we consider galaxies out to large distances from the clusters , so that some cluster galaxies have small local densities ( log @xmath39 ) .",
    "the density overlap ( between field and clusters results ) we see in figs .",
    "[ fig : denbins2 ] and  [ fig : denbinsb2 ] happens for cluster galaxies that are in the infall ( far from the center ) .",
    "considering the results from @xcite we decided to adopt a nearest neighbour method to estimate the local environment .",
    "the authors also mention that the choice of @xmath40 - the rank of the density - defining neighbour - is very important , as the environment measure may loose power in the case @xmath40 is larger than the number of galaxies residing in the halo",
    ". hence , we chose to work with the @xmath38 local galaxy density estimator , as @xmath41 is typically smaller than the number of galaxies we have per cluster and is a common estimate in the literature . to estimate local galaxy densities we proceed as follows .",
    "for every galaxy we compute its projected distance , d@xmath42 , to the 5th nearest galaxy found around it , within a maximum velocity offset of 1000 @xmath43 @xmath16 ( relative to the velocity of the galaxy in question ) .",
    "the local density @xmath38 is simply given by 5/@xmath44d@xmath45 , and is measured in units of galaxies / mpc@xmath46 .",
    "density estimates are also obtained relatively only to galaxies brighter than a fixed luminosity range , which we adopt as @xmath47 . on what regards the global environment",
    "we consider the distance to the center of the parent cluster , the cluster mass , or the comparison between field and cluster results .",
    "the fiber collision issue affects the sdss spectroscopic sample and the derived density estimates . due to a mechanical restriction spectroscopic fibers",
    "can not be placed closer than 55 arcsecs on the sky .",
    "an algorithm used for target selection randomly chooses which galaxy gets a fiber , in case of a conflict @xcite .",
    "this problem is reduced by spectroscopic plate overlaps , but fiber collisions still lead to a @xmath48 6% incompleteness in the main galaxy sample .",
    "our approach to fix this problem is similar to the one adopted by @xcite and @xcite . for galaxies brighter than @xmath49 18 with no redshifts we assume the redshift of the nearest neighbour on the sky ( generally the galaxy it collided with )",
    "this may result in some nearby galaxies to be placed at high redshift , artificially increasing their estimated luminosities .",
    "due to that the collided galaxies also assume the magnitudes of their nearest neighbours , resulting in an unbiased luminosity distribution .",
    "notice that the fraction of fixed galaxies is quite small ( at most @xmath50 , at highest densities ) ; the above correction procedure has been shown to accurately match the multiplicity function of groups in mock catalogues @xcite ; and the velocity distribution ( relative to group centre ) of the original and fixed samples are consistent @xcite .",
    "hence , the local galaxy density estimates take in account the fiber collision issue .      for the current work we consider the stacked properties of cluster and field galaxies ( in this case , regarding local density only ) .",
    "we do that considering the radial offset ( in units of @xmath22 ) , absolute magnitudes , colors and local densities of all member galaxies coming from the 152 clusters ( or the field ) .",
    "our sample consists of 5,106 bright member galaxies with @xmath5 ( at @xmath19 ) , 1,309 faint members with @xmath6 ( at @xmath33 ) , 2,936 bright field galaxies and 1,740 faint field galaxies .",
    "the bright and faint regimes are the same for cluster and field objects .",
    "to compute the absolute magnitudes of each galaxy ( in @xmath51 bands ) we consider the following formula : @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is one of the four sdss bands we considered ) , where dm is the distance modulus ( considering the redshift of each galaxy ) , @xmath54 is the k@xmath2correction and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , @xcite ) is a mild evolutionary correction applied to the magnitudes ( for each galaxy redshift ) . the k@xmath2corrections are obtained directly from the sdss database , for every object in each band .",
    "rest - frame colors are also derived for all objects .",
    "all the magnitudes we retrieved from the sdss are de - reddened model magnitudes ( see paper i ) .",
    "a large number of galaxy properties were derived by different research groups for the sdss data set .",
    "these parameters ( such as stellar mass and star formation rate ) are derived from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of stellar population synthesis models , considering the galaxy spectra or the broad band galaxy photometry . in the current work",
    "we consider parameters derived from the application of the starlight code @xcite , the `` galspec '' analysis provided by the mpa - jhu group ( from the max planck institute for astrophysics and the johns hopkins university ; @xcite ) , and the magphys code @xcite applied to the sdss plus wise photometry @xcite .",
    "a brief description of the parameters we selected from these different methods is given below .",
    "this code fits an observed spectrum with a linear combination of a number of template spectra with known properties ( see paper iii for details ) .",
    "we applied the code to the galaxy spectra of the galaxies in our sample . among other parameters derived by starlight",
    ", we consider for this work the age ( and its dispersion ) of the stellar population and the metallicity ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "both parameters ( age and @xmath57 ) represent the mass - weighted mean values .",
    "we have also derived a spectral classification , on which each object is called a seyfert , liner or star - forming ( sf ) according to their position in the baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( bpt ) diagram .",
    "galaxies with no significant emission lines are called passive . when applying starlight we require at least 30% of good spectral coverage ( no bad quality flags on ) . hence , we were not able to derive the above parameters for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "we end up with 5,060 bright member galaxies with @xmath5 ( at @xmath19 ) , 1,303 faint members with @xmath6 ( at @xmath33 ) , 2,912 bright field galaxies and 1,714 faint field galaxies . that represents @xmath48 1@xmath58 loss .",
    "the `` galspec '' galaxy properties from mpa - jhu were derived for the dr8 galaxy spectra ( nearly all of which were in dr7 ) .",
    "the galaxy parameters we selected for this work are the bpt classification , the stellar mass and the star formation rate , and some index and line measurements , such as d@xmath59(4000 ) and h@xmath60 . from the bpt diagram",
    "they divide galaxies into the `` star forming '' , `` composite '' , `` agn '' , `` low s / n star forming '' , `` low s / n agn '' , and `` unclassifiable '' categories .",
    "we consider the total stellar mass and star formation rate values ( sfrs ) .",
    "the total stellar masses are based on model magnitudes .",
    "sfrs are computed within the galaxy fiber aperture using the nebular emission lines as described in @xcite .",
    "outside of the fiber the estimates use the galaxy photometry , as in @xcite .",
    "agn and galaxies with weak emission lines , have sfrs estimates from the photometry . due to the minimum criteria required by the mpa - jhu group ( _ e.g. _ , redshift ,",
    "s / n ) not all galaxies in our sample are matched to the mpa - jhu results . besides that we also require that the galaxies had the starlight parameters available .",
    "hence , our sample with mpa - jhu values ( common to the starlight ) have 4,953 bright and 1,297 faint member galaxies , and also 2,864 bright and 1,672 faint field galaxies .",
    "that is 97@xmath58 of the original sample .",
    "@xcite combined sdss and wise photometry for the full sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample , creating seds that cover @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "they used magphys to model simultaneously and consistently both the attenuated stellar sed and the dust emission at 12 @xmath62 and 22 @xmath62 .",
    "we selected from their data the star formation rate , the stellar mass , the dust attenuation parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as well as the dust , 12 @xmath62 and 22 @xmath62 luminosities .",
    "we were able to retrieve data from the catalog of @xcite for 4,900 bright and 1,244 faint member galaxies , and also 2,847 bright and 1,671 faint field galaxies .",
    "that is @xmath65 97@xmath58 of the original sample .",
    "galaxies in the local universe can generally be split in two types depending on their star formation activity and structure .",
    "early - type galaxies are redder , with little star formation and high concentration . on the contrary late - type galaxies are bluer ,",
    "show active star formation and are less concentrated . in paper",
    "iv we separate galaxies according to three parameters , two related to their star - formation properties ( @xmath66 color and the spectral classification @xmath67 ) , and one to the structure ( the concentration index @xmath4 ) .",
    "after @xcite we called blue / red galaxies those with ( @xmath66 ) values smaller / greater than 2.2 .",
    "we considered objects with @xmath68 as disc - dominated , and the rest as bulge - dominated galaxies ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "passive galaxies are those with @xmath67 smaller than @xmath20.05 , while the star - forming objects have larger values for this parameter . in that work",
    "we characterize the variation of different populations from the extreme field , through the outskirts of groups and clusters , up to the most dense regions of the universe , the core of these structures .",
    "our results indicate that pre - processing in groups leads to a strong evolution in galaxy properties , before they are accreted by large clusters . in agreement to @xcite",
    ", we find that local density is the main driver for galaxy evolution and not the parent halo mass .",
    "the evolution is such that star formation is quenched in the group scale , but morphological transformation is a separate process , occurring in larger galaxy systems .    in the current work",
    "we are interested on investigating the properties of transitional galaxies , and their environmental dependence .",
    "those are likely objects caught in their way from the `` blue cloud '' to the `` red sequence '' , or in a few cases passive galaxies in a process of `` rejuvenation '' .",
    "we select these galaxies simply considering two of the parameters used in paper iv ( @xmath66 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "we define two types , which we call `` red discs '' ( objects with @xmath71 and @xmath68 ) , and `` blue bulges '' ( with @xmath72 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "additionally we call the `` regular '' _ early _ and _ late - types _ as `` red bulges '' ( @xmath71 and @xmath69 ) , and `` blue discs '' ( with @xmath72 and @xmath68 ) , respectively .",
    "we compare the properties of these four classes below , as well as their variation from the field to clusters .    as we consider two simple parameters ( an observed color and a concentration index ) to separate galaxy populations there might be the question if the samples are largely affected by other populations .",
    "for instance , some of the `` red discs '' could be active star - forming galaxies that look red due to large amounts of dust . to verify that is not the case we inspect the color - color diagram , ( @xmath66)@xmath73 _ vs _",
    "( @xmath74)@xmath73 , that is considered an effective way for separating passive from star - forming objects @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : gals_sep1 ] exhibits this diagram for the cluster galaxies considered in this work .",
    "bright galaxies ( @xmath5 ) are in the left panels , while faint objects ( @xmath6 ) are in the right panels . on top",
    "we display red bulges ( red points ) and blue discs ( blue points ) , while in the bottom panels we have red discs ( black ) and blue bulges ( green ) .",
    "the thin lines represent the limits adopted by @xcite , and the thick lines shows the limits of @xcite .",
    "galaxies above ( below ) the lines are passive ( star - forming ) according to these different authors .",
    "we can see on all panels that galaxies we considered as quiescent / star - forming are generally above / below the division lines .",
    "in particular , the separation given by @xcite seems more effective .",
    "we also notice the `` red discs '' show only a small fraction of objects consistent to star - forming .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : bptclass_sfr ] we confirm these conclusions through the inspection of the spectral classification from the starlight code ( top ) and the mpa - jhu group ( middle panel ) . in the top panel a galaxy is called passive if there are no significant emission lines . from the bpt diagram",
    "an object is classified as seyfert , liner or star - forming ( sf ) . in the middle panel a more detailed classification is given , with the `` sf '' , `` low s / n sf '' , `` composite '' , `` agn '' , `` low s / n liner '' and `` unclassifiable '' possibilities .",
    "green lines are for `` blue bulges '' , blue lines for `` blue discs '' , black lines for `` red discs '' , and red lines for `` red bulges '' .",
    "these results consider all cluster galaxies with @xmath75 ( bright and faint ) . as we can see from the top panel @xmath76 of `` red discs '' are passive , with only @xmath77 being considered sf .",
    "the rest is most composed of liners .",
    "similar conclusions are reached from the middle panel , with @xmath78 of the `` red discs '' being considered sf , although this more refined classification results in @xmath79 of these galaxies being called `` low s / n sf '' .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bptclass_sfr ] we display the star formation rate ( sfr ) distribution estimated by the mpa group for these four populations . from this plot",
    "we can see the `` red discs '' are clearly distinct from the regular `` blue discs '' .",
    "however , the sfr distribution of the `` red discs '' is not identical to the the `` red bulges '' neither .",
    "the former shown a non - negligible fraction of galaxies with residual sf in comparison to the latter .",
    "note that the blue galaxies ( bulges or discs ) have more similar sfr distributions .        in order to have a rough idea of the morphological classification of the galaxies ( especially the transition populations ) we decided to perform a visual inspection of galaxies in our sample . that was done by bv for the `` red disc '' and `` blue bulge '' bright populations .",
    "a total of 1332 red discs were inspected , 836 within clusters and 496 in the field . for the blue bulge population",
    "we have 111 member galaxies and 157 field objects .",
    "the red discs were classified as `` face - on red spiral '' ( _ frs _ ) , `` face - on red / blue spiral '' ( _ fbs _ , with significant bluer colors in the arms ) , `` edge - on disc '' ( _ edg _ ) , and `` spheroidal '' ( _ sph _ ) . the blue bulges were classified as `` spheroidal '' ( _ sph _ ) , `` edge - on disc '' ( _ edg _ ) , `` face - on disc '' ( _ fd _ ) , and `` double core '' ( _ dc _ , for galaxies with two cores or strong signs of interaction ) . from these visual morphological classifications we verified that more than @xmath80 of the `` red discs '' are classified as _ frs _ ( `` face - on red spiral '' ) and less than @xmath81 are called _ edg _ ( `` edge - on disc '' ) , reinforcing that misclassification due to edge - on spirals with high star formation is not an issue .",
    "the rest is classified as _",
    "fbs _ ( @xmath48 @xmath82 ) or _ sph _ ( @xmath48 @xmath81 ) .",
    "for the `` blue bulges '' more than @xmath80 are classified as _ sph _",
    "( `` spheroidal '' ) .",
    "the remaining objects are classified as _ fd _ ( @xmath48 @xmath83 ) , _ edg _ ( @xmath48 @xmath84 ) , or",
    "( @xmath48 @xmath85 ) .",
    "note this classification process is very uncertain as even for the bright galaxies a high level of agreement between different classifiers is usually not achieved .",
    "that is due to the subjective nature of such visual inspection and low contrast of many stamps .",
    "our main goal with such exercise was to confirm the expectations from figs .  [",
    "fig : gals_sep1 ] and [ fig : bptclass_sfr ] , roughly verifying the `` red discs '' are not dominated by `` edge - on discs '' and the `` blue bulges '' are mostly classified as `` spheroidal '' systems .",
    "it is also important to mention the reason we did not extended such visual inspection for the fainter objects is the fact that even for some bright systems the classification was already very difficult . as a matter of fact ,",
    "our first step was trying to use the classification from the `` galaxy zoo '' project @xcite , both for bright and faint galaxies of our sample .",
    "the `` galaxy zoo '' project considers an object as `` spiral '' if the debiased spiral fraction is larger than 0.8 .",
    "if the debiased elliptical fraction is larger than 0.8 then the galaxy is classified as `` elliptical '' .",
    "if none of those cases are true the galaxy is called `` uncertain '' . considering those three possibilities we had to discard @xmath48 @xmath86 of our sample .",
    "unfortunately , all these objects are called `` uncertain '' . due to",
    "that we did not use the classification from `` galaxy zoo '' .",
    "it is important to stress that in the current work we are mainly interested on comparing the physical properties and environment of galaxy populations divided by color and concentration , and not on performing a detailed morphological classification .",
    "hence , we consider the morphological inspection we performed is satisfactory for our goals .      although the `` red disc '' population seem not to be contaminated by a large number of highly elongated dusty spirals we decided to perform one more check based on the galaxy s axial ratio ( taking @xmath87 as a proxy for inclination ) .",

    "we can also use relations between different galaxy parameters for that purpose . in the current work , if we assume the `` red discs '' to originate in the blue cloud , being a transition population to the red sequence , it is interesting to compare the location of blue and red discs in different parameter spaces .",

    "we then decided to investigate if part of the ongoing star formation in the `` blue bulges '' could be the result of mergers .",
    "we do so as the visual inspection of the `` blue bulges '' indicates some of them show signs of interaction .",
    "we investigated this further estimating the asymmetry of these galaxies , and also comparing them to the `` red bulges '' . to derive asymmetry for these galaxies we used the public software pyca @xcite .",

    "the software is applied to the @xmath128-band images , which are deep enough and not too affected by local star formation .",
    "we compared the asymmetry cumulative distributions of all `` blue bulges '' and the subset of `` red bulges '' , finding the former to be shifted to higher a values than the latter .",
    "as the two populations span different stellar mass ranges we then performed the comparison only for galaxies in a common mass range ( 10.2 @xmath129 log m@xmath127 10.8 ) , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_bb_rb ] , in the top for cluster and in the bottom panel for field galaxies .",
    "even for this small stellar mass range the differences between the asymmetry distributions for the two populations are easily seen . the comparison between cluster and field results in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_bb_rb ] also reveals no difference for the `` red bulges '' , but slightly higher asymmetry values for the `` blue bulge '' cluster population . that reinforces the discussion related to fig .",
    "[ fig : age_metl_mass ] ( @xmath9 4 ) , where we argue that `` blue bulges '' in the field and in clusters may be composed of different subtypes of galaxies",
    ". that could be one reason explaining higher @xmath57 values for `` blue bulges '' in clusters .        from the visual inspection of extreme cases ( low and high asymmetry ) of red and blue bulges we find the following .",
    "in many cases the `` blue bulges '' show clear signs of strong interaction , indicating wet mergers . however , in some cases they look like very asymmetric low mass spiral galaxies dominated by a bulge . on the other hand , for the `` red bulges '' with high a values , when the asymmetry is clearly distinguishable they only display signs of dry mergers .    for the galaxies with low asymmetry , both populations ( `` blue bulges '' and `` red bulges '' ) look like `` spheroidal '' or bulge dominated systems . in particular , the `` blue bulges '' are small and often display a starburst spectrum .",
    "hence , we can say that from low to high asymmetry the `` blue bulges '' can be simple spheroids , or bulge dominated low mass spirals , or wet mergers . however , it is important to stress that this visual inspection we perform is not the main goal of the current work ( as we discussed in @xmath9 2.6 ) . in particular ,",
    "the `` blue bulges '' are generally faint low mass systems , making their visual classification harder .",
    "when we say some of them look like very asymmetric spiral galaxies , that does not mean we are referring to large massive early spirals .    considering the asymmetry value we also compared the specific star formation rate _ vs _ stellar mass plane of low and high a `` blue bulges '' .",

    "that indicates these mergers contribute to make part of the the `` blue bulge '' population more active than the rest . a similar comparison , but using h@xmath60 ( instead of ssfr ) , also reveals differences between low and high a `` blue bulges '' , indicating the presence of young stellar populations ( @xmath109 gyr ) among the most asymmetrical `` blue bulges '' .",
    "a similar plot using metallicity ( @xmath10m@xmath3 ) shows no significant difference , reinforcing the sfr enhancement is recent .",
    "several different works in the literature aim to investigate transitional galaxies and to assess the time scale for quenching star formation @xcite .",
    "many results point to a slow quenching scenario on which processes like strangulation are predominant @xcite . on top of that the importance of the cluster environment has been strengthened , especially by studies based on the investigation of galaxy properties in the phase - space @xcite .",

    "although we are mainly interested in transitional galaxies ( in particular `` red discs '' as an intermediate population between the blue cloud and red sequence ) , our conclusions are in good agreement to those above . from figs .",
    "[ fig : zagessfr_mass]@xmath2[fig : sff_lookbt ] we have different indications that the star formation quenching is slow ( @xmath1 2 gyr ) and depends on stellar mass , but also on environment .",

    "all these facts , plus the distributions of sfr , @xmath107 luminosity , l@xmath32 and ssfr , indicate the red and blue discs are distinct populations , with the former possibly representing the transition to `` red bulges '' .",
    "this transition is slow , with quenching time scales of @xmath131 2 gyr .",
    "morphological transformations would happen even in a longer time scale , which is also in good agreement to a scenario requiring pre - processing in groups @xcite . in the pre - processing scenario galaxy transformations",

    "we do not make an environmental distinction within clusters for the blue galaxies ( discs and bulges ) ; so that the good agreement we see to the field is probably due to predominance of these sf blue galaxies in the lower density infall regions of clusters ( closer in density to the field values ) .",
    "this similarity between `` blue discs '' and `` blue bulges '' seen on the ssfr@xmath2m@xmath3 relation ( fig .",

    "[ fig : bptclass_sfr ] ,  [ fig : rad_tc_sig5 ] ,  [ fig : ssfr_mass_dens ] ,  [ fig : sff_lookbt ] ) .",
    "although these two populations seem to have similar sfr and dust luminosity , they display slightly different distributions of age , metallicity and stellar mass for bright galaxies ( fig .  [",

    "another possibility is that these blue early - type galaxies be the result of rejuvenation , through the merger with a star forming galaxy . @xcite",

    "is reinforced by the results of @xcite , who investigated low mass blue - sequence e / s0 galaxies .",
    "they argue these low mass galaxies are more common in low - density field environments where fresh gas infall is possible .",
    "they find evidence that star formation is bursty , involving externally triggered gas inflows .",
    "they also suggest most of these galaxies can grow stellar disks on relatively short timescales .",
    "as stated above we do find evidence for mergers within the `` blue bulges '' sample , both from their visual inspection and the analysis of asymmetry ( see figs .  [",

    "however , in some cases the high asymmetry `` blue bulges '' simply resemble asymmetric low mass spiral galaxies dominated by a bulge .",
    "an interesting point is that we find evidence that high a `` blue bulges '' have an enhanced star formation compared to the more regular galaxies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ssfr_mstar_lha_bb ] ) . to summarize , from low to high asymmetry we find `` blue bulges '' that are spheroids , bulge dominated low mass spirals , or resemble wet mergers .",
    "hence , quoting @xcite , there may not be a single evolutionary path for the blue early - type objects .",
    "as @xcite suggest some of these objects may be going up to the red sequence , while others are going in the opposite direction towards the blue cloud .",
    "in this work we measure the typical environment of transitional galaxy populations selected solely by photometric parameters ( color and concentration ) .",

    "finally , we estimate the asymmetry of the `` blue bulges '' , trying to assess the impact of mergers on this population .",
    "our main results are :    1 .   at fixed morphology",
    "we see the number of `` red discs '' ( `` blue bulges '' ) relative to the number of discs ( bulges ) vary strongly with local density , especially in the cluster environments ( figs .",
    "[ fig : denbins2 ] ,  [ fig : denbinsb2 ] ,  [ fig : radbins2 ] ,  [ fig : radbinsb2 ] ) .",

    "galaxies of the same color , but different morphologies ( discs or bulges ) show little difference in their typical environment . however , that is not true if morphology is fixed , instead of color .",

    "on what regards dust luminosity `` blue bulges '' have slightly lower values than `` blue discs '' , which have much larger l@xmath32 than `` red discs '' . nonetheless , the later still shows higher l@xmath32 values than `` red bulges '' ( fig .",

    "no overlap of blue and red populations , and `` red discs '' and `` red bulges '' are different in all environments .",
    "we also find the largest variations with local density for the red objects at fixed morphology ( mainly for the `` red discs '' within clusters ) .",

    "a similar analysis in different stellar mass ranges reveals this parameter to be even more important to galaxy properties when compared to @xmath38 .",
    "the largest variations are again seen for `` red discs '' , suggesting those galaxies halt star - formation as increasing their mass and moving into clusters .",
