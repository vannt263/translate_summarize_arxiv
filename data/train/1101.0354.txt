    "the concept of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement which can be used for detection of weak force acting on system such as gravitational wave had been introduced to allow repeatable detection.@xcite the basic requirement of a qnd measurement is that a series of measurements of the variable of system should give predictable results.@xcite it means that the observable @xmath0 must commute with hamiltonian @xmath1 that describes interacting system and detector , i.e. , @xmath2=0 $ ] . a large number of works associated with qnd measurements have been done in quantum optic,@xcite cavity qed@xcite and circuit qed.@xcite    recently , qnd measurements have experimentally been achieved on superconducting flux qubit system by investigating the correlation between the results of two consecutive measurements.@xcite however , in general , the measuring apparatus is a mesoscopic system ( e.g. , dc - squid ) which is coupled to environment .",
