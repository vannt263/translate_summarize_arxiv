    "due to the experimental difficulties in persuing hyperonic scattering experiments the modeling of hypernuclei is crucial for investigating interactions in the baryon octet . for this reason",
    "the development and application of microscopic models linking in - medium and free interactions is necessary .",
    "the extension of the density dependent relativistic hadron field theory ( ddrh ) @xcite into the strangeness sector and to hypernuclei is such a microscopic link . besides an appropriate microscopic description it is essential to chose suitable systems in which dynamic many - body effects play a minor role in order to get more direct access to generic hyperon interactions . in this respect",
    "we present our studies concerned with _ weakly bound @xmath0 states _ in hypernuclei .",
    "it is found that deeply bound @xmath0 states are fairly save from subtle dynamical effects  though caution needs to be taken there in other respects .",
    "such deeply bound @xmath0 states can ideally be found in heavy hypernuclei .",
    "for the investigation of heavy hypernuclei there is , besides the standard spectroscopic methods , also the possibility of the spectroscopy of _ auger neutrons _ @xcite as planned in a recently proposed experiment at jlab @xcite .",
    "we present auger transition rates for @xmath1pb calculated within our self - consistent model and discuss the spectroscopic content of the spectra .",
    "the ddrh model @xcite is a relativistic lagrangian field theory with baryonic and mesonic degrees of freedom . in",
    "- medium interactions are derived from a dirac - brueckner ( db ) calculation using the free space bonn a interaction .",
    "the db self - energies are mapped onto ddrh self - energies leading to vertex functionals that depend on lorentz scalars of the baryonic field operators .",
    "the lagrange density of ddrh is given by @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the free baryonic and mesonic lagrange densities , whereas the interaction lagrangian is given by : @xmath5 due to the functional structure of the vertices @xmath6 the baryonic equations of motion contain additional _ rearrangement self - energies _ which arise due to the variation of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "these rearrangement self - energies account for static polarization effects in the baryonic medium , assuring the thermodynamical consistency of the theory and lorentz covariance of the field equations @xcite .",
    "in this section we point out the subtleties of extracting information on generic hyperon interactions from weakly bound @xmath0 systems on two examples : ( 1 ) the influence of the close continuum threshold on the structure of @xmath0 spin - orbit ( s.o . )",
    "doublets and ( 2 ) the influence of the delocalization of the @xmath0 wave function resulting from the weak binding of the @xmath0 .",
    "these effects are _ independent of the specific interaction _ and , in general , contribute as an apparent quenching of spin - orbit strengths .          from weakly bound systems ,",
    "e.g. neutron - rich dripline nuclei @xcite , it is known that a s.o .",
    "doublet which approaches its continuum threshold gets compressed before actually becoming unbound .",
    "this is due to the so called avoided level crossing , reflecting the fact that a state which becomes unbound has to cross other states lying lower in the continuum before it reappears as a resonance . in a mean - field description this situation is in particular found in the light p - shell hypernuclei .",
    "the effect is investigated in a model study by varying the @xmath11 coupling in @xmath12o artificially such that the centroid energy e@xmath10 of the 1p s.o .",
    "doublet approaches the continuum threshold ( for notation see fig .",
    "[ fig : so ] ) .",
    "the resulting s.o . splitting @xmath9e depends sensitively on the location of e@xmath10 relative to the continuum threshold .",
    "therefore a clean extraction of the generic s.o .",
    "interaction from light hypernuclei is hardly to achieve because the threshold compression will always be superimposed on the generic s.o . interaction .",
    "however , around the @xmath13ca region the @xmath0 1p doublet has moved far enough into the bound region such that the threshold effect ceases to be important .         another effect which diminnishes the influence of the s.o .",
    "interaction on the observed splitting by an additional reduction is the delocalization of the @xmath0 wave function due to the shallow @xmath0 potential ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this comes about because the splitting is proportional to the overlap integral between the single particle density of the considered state and the s.o .",
    "potential which is well localized in the nuclear surface . to determine the importance of this delocalization we define the following measure for the fraction of the @xmath0 and neutron wave function @xmath15 residing inside the nuclear rms radius : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is chosen such that @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "results for different nuclei are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : deloc ] .",
    "it is obvious that this effect is especially pronounced in light hypernuclei and in the weakly bound orbits in the heavy mass region .",
    "we conclude from these investigations , that hyperon interactions still can be determined provided that both the centroid energy and the relative splitting of a doublet are considered . in this respect the new @xmath21 spectroscopic results , reporting an almost vanishing s.o .",
    "splitting in e.g. @xmath22c @xcite , point to an extremely weak effective @xmath0 s.o .",
    "strength but for decisive conclusions on the generic interaction more strongly bound heavy hypernuclei should be investigated .",
    "shell in @xmath1pb due to auger neutron emission are plotted versus the kinetic energy of the outgoing neutron .",
    "the insert shows the @xmath0 and neutron level schemes for this transition where the involved states are marked . ]",
    "auger rates for the capture of a @xmath0 and the de - excitation of heavy hypernuclei are calculated within the ddrh model @xcite .",
    "different to a previous attempt @xcite our approach treats the binding mean - field , wave functions and interactions in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the process is described by the production of a neutron - particle  neutron - hole state due to the de - excitation of the @xmath0 , where the particle is unbound .",
