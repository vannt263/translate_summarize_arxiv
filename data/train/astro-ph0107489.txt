    "moreover , despite preliminary work done by stone , xu & mundy ( 1995 ) , the incidence of a highly variable ( as well in the spatial as in the time domain ) mechanical luminosity [ @xmath10 still has to be investigated in detail . in particular",
    ", the turbulence of the ejected nebulae has to be studied in detail in order to test whether it is related to pre - existing turbulence ( or any other process of fragmentation , hence variability ) that already arose in the _ winds _ themselves before they interacted .",
    "+ recall that the spectral variability originating in massive wr stars and cspn shows the wr phenomenon to be remarkably similar in both ( grosdidier 2000 , 2001 ) . despite the strong differences between both types of hot stars , this supports the understanding of the wr spectral phenomenon as being purely atmospheric .",
    "this , in line with the believed similarity of the processes that are at play in the formation of the related cn ( chu 1993 ) , places one in a position to check also for universality of the shaping of cn surrounding _ any _ hot stars .      like",
    "hii regions , gas motions in nebulae ejected by hot stars are characterized by very large reynolds numbers .",
    "for example , the reynolds numbers exhibited by typical hii regions may be as large as @xmath11 ( boily 1993 ) , using 1 pc for the characteristic spatial scale , 10 km s@xmath8 for the velocity scale and considering the normal kinematic viscosity for ionized hydrogen gas at electronic temperatures of about 10,000 k. such values are well above the critical values ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) determining the transition to turbulence .",
    "like hii regions , it is expected that the kinematics of nebulae ejected by hot stars would be best described in terms of turbulent flows .",
    "turbulence is characterized by a high degree of non - linearity in the governing equations and complex coupling mechanisms , leading to a variety of physical / transport processes occuring over a great variety of scale lengths .",
    "+ turbulence is inherently _ apparently _ stochastic , since the flow variables ( _ e.g. _ velocity , pressure , density ) fluctuate in an unpredictable manner about their mean values .",
    "however , turbulence also exhibits specific length scales and scaling laws , with rapidly increasing numbers of smaller features as a result of energy cascading down a ladder leading ultimately to dissipation ( fleck 1996 ) . at small scales , turbulent energy returns to the ambient medium as thermal energy .",
    "the nearly dissipationless energy cascade makes the flow not strictly unpredictable if one attempts to study quantitatively its structure via a statistical approach .",
    "indeed , the signature of turbulence is confirmed by the presence of correlations in the flow variables between neighboring points that can be detected by means of statistical functions ( scalo 1984 ) .",
    "the non - linearity of the equations of hydrodynamics causes high amplitude structures to change their shape in a way that continuously broadens the wave spectrum to include smaller and smaller scales .",
    "a simple , unique wave train is expected to steepen into a shock front damping at the leading edge .",
    "however , an intricate pattern of motions likely drives a cascade of energy dissipation taking on a fractal structure ( henriksen 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "+ a statistical search for any degree of correlation between neighboring points could be carried out via two main approaches : autocorrelation functions or structure functions ( these two statistical tools are more reliable than the dispersion - scale relation ; scalo 1984 , miville - deschnes & joncas 1995 ) .",
    "the so - called ` structure function ' is defined as the average of the quadratic differences of velocities as a function of the spatial separation between the points where the velocity is measured ( miesch & bally 1994 ) . in this study",
    "we favor the structure function calculation because it is more robust than the autocorrelation method .",
    "the robustness of the structure function technique originates in one important fact : its application requires the use of velocity _ differences _ rather than velocity ` coherence ' ( in the case of the autocorrelation method ) between points separated by a given distance .",
    "indeed , the use of the autocorrelation function assumes that the statistical properties of the flows are not a function of position , the velocity and density fields being considered _",
    "stationary_. when using structure functions , we assume a less stringent hypothesis : _ local stationarity_. however , note that at large scales the flows always lose their stationarity ( scalo 1984 ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to describe the turbulent behavior of nebulae ejected by hot stars , both from the density structure ( via high - resolution imagery ) and the kinematical structure ( via high spatial resolution fabry - perot interferometry ) .",
    "the search for turbulence will be carried out through the calculation of the moments of the density / velocity increments for different orders ( _ i.e. _ we will not limit our investigation to the second order structure function , as is generally the case in other studies ) .",
    "examination of the structure function for different orders additionally provides a way to estimate the level of intermittency in the flows . + m1 - 67 , surrounding the wr star wr124",
    "( wn8 ) , was chosen for its relatively large apparent angular diameter ( which allows one to study any possible energy cascade within a large span of scale lengths ) and its _ suspected _ weak interaction with the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "the latter condition ensures that 1 ) the ejecta would be less affected by collision and mixing with the pre - existing ambient gas , and therefore 2 ) the dynamics and structure of the ejected nebula would best reflect the initial conditions of the ejected winds .",
    "this , in line with the apparently universal , ubiquitous clumping of hot stellar winds , places one in a position to test the possible impact of the wind fragmentation on the nebular fragmentation .",
    "note that high resolution optical spectra of wr124 recently obtained by acker ( priv .",
    "comm . ) at the observatoire de haute provence ( france ) and marchenko ( 1998 ) results indeed show the central star of m1 - 67 to be variable .",

    "for such a large distance , the central star must be a massive wr star rather than a cspn , given its relatively high apparent brightness , @xmath15 ( massey 1984 ) , and the huge interstellar reddening to m1 - 67 ( @xmath161.5 ; solf & carsenty 1982 ; esteban 1991 ; crowther 1995b ) .",
    "this is compatible with @xmath17 , which is typical for wn8 stars .",
    "photo - ionization modelling of m1 - 67 has been made by crowther ( 1999 ) , who were able to trace the central star h - lyman continuum flux distribution , which is normally not directly detectable .",
    "the main outcome of this work was to establish the crucial importance of a line - blanketed energy distribution for proper modelling of the wn8 atmosphere .",
    "+ as an e - type ( ejected material ) nebula ( see chu , treffers & kwitter 1983 ; smith 1995 and references therein ) , m1 - 67 constitutes an object in its earliest phase of wind interaction , when the ejecta are least affected by collision and mixing with the interstellar medium , and thus best reflect the initial conditions of the ejected winds .",
    "this is supported by detailed abundance analysis of the nebula : n / o @xmath18 2.95 ( esteban _ et al .",

    "note that the e - type galactic cn rcw58 ( central star : wr40 ; spectral type : wn8 ) , is also obviously enriched and must contain stellar ejecta ; however this nebula already shows a circumstellar ring which suggests a more pronounced interaction with its ambient medium .",
    "for the same reason , we do not consider the multiple ring ( marston 1995 ) cn surrounding the wn8 star wr16 : the two outer rings are likely e - type ring nebulae , but their dynamical ages are relatively long ( some @xmath19 yrs and @xmath20 yrs ) . in addition",

    "+ in the framework of our search for the direct influence of a clumpy , turbulent - like stellar wind on the surrounding nebula it ejects and more generally on the interstellar medium ( moffat 1998 ) , we have obtained _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) _ wide field planetary camera two _ ( wfpc2 ) images of the nebula m1 - 67 .",

    "they reported no overall global shell structure to the nebula ( see also grosdidier 1999 ) from the projected radial distribution of the azimuthally - averaged h@xmath0 surface brightness .",
    "rather , the radial profile centered on wr124 agrees with a decreasing , wind - density power - law distribution with increasing distance from the central star .",
    "( 1998 ) understood the absence of a well defined shell as evidence for an extremely small age of the nebula : the wr phase may have just turned on , making the interaction zone ( _ i.e. _ the nebula ) of the present fast wind with the previous , slower wind still undetectable ( which is in line with the presence of h emission lines in the spectrum of wr124 ; crowther 1995a ) .",
    "+ however , these deep hst / wfpc2 images in h@xmath0 of the nebula also suggested that m1 - 67 may likely be the imprint of a previous , luminous blue variable ( lbv ) slow wind ejected from the wr central star wr124 , which is supported by other arguments ( sirianni _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , and references therein ; massey & johnson 1998 ) as opposed to a classical red supergiant very slow wind ( smith 1996 ) blown and compressed by the present wr wind .",

    "generally , the whole periphery of the nebula appears made up of numerous small ( 15  ) reversed bow - shock like structures .",

    "here , we expand on the description given in grosdidier _ et al . _",
    "four wfpc2 images of m1 - 67 with a total combined exposure of 10,000 seconds were taken in march 1997 with the hst through the narrowband f656n h@xmath0 filter ( biretta 1996 ) .",

    "the shifts were determined using at least 15 ( planetary camera ; pc ) and 2530 ( wide field cameras 1 , 2 and 3 ; wfs ) bright stars and calculating the relative displacements between each exposure through the estimation of the star centroids .",
    "note that rather than applying one shift to an image to match the other , we applied half - displacements to both images .",
    "this reduces the differences in artificial broadening of the stellar profiles between the two images . finally , we achieved full widths at half maximum spanning 2.42.5 pixels ( @xmath25  ) for the pc , and 1.72.0 pixels ( 0.170.2  ) for the wfs , in the h@xmath0 band .",
    "+ the four narrowband f656n h@xmath0 images were straddled in wavelength by broadband v and r images : four wfpc2 images of the same field taken through each of the broadband f675w r and f555w v filters ( biretta 1996 ) were separately combined in the same way to produce similar high signal - to - noise ratio images of ` continuum ' starlight relatively close to the wavelength of h@xmath0 .",
    "the v and r images enabled us to _ interpolate _ the stellar light to the wavelength corresponding to h@xmath0 .",
    "after proper flux scaling and spatial shifting ( also within @xmath240.010.03 pixels ) , the interpolated broad - band image was carefully subtracted from the h@xmath0 image in order to produce a deep continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 image with the field stars removed .",
    "note that we achieved full widths at half maximum spanning 2.42.5 pixels for the pc , and 1.72.0 pixels for the wfs , both in the r and v bands .",
    "these values are similar to those obtained for the combined h@xmath0 image and permited an optimum continuum starlight subtraction . + the scaling in intensity between the interpolated broad - band image and the combined h@xmath0 image was made by measuring the flux of at least 20 bright stars in each chip , and minimizing the residuals in the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 image .",
    "this procedure works quite well for h@xmath0 line - free stars , which are the majority . for wr124",
    "we applied a different flux scaling because this wn8 star emits a copious amount of h@xmath0+heii@xmath266560 light .",
    "it is worthy of note that we have obtained all images within a contiguous span of time ( 6 hst orbits ) .",
    "this reduced problems with potential variable stars in the subtraction of starlight from the original h@xmath0 image .",
    "note that the images were originally pipeline processed before being released but required a full recalibration because of severe changes in the dark files .",
    "nebular kinematics can be studied very effectively by observations at optical wavelengths with the use of a scanning fabry - perot interferometer in combination with a two - dimensional detector .",

    "a neon calibration lamp was used to obtain rest frame interferograms .",
    "finally , the data processing was done using the iraf and adhoc ( see amram 1995 , blais - ouellette 1999 ) packages .",
    "we favor the use of wavelets to perform structure function calculations because this method is much more robust than the classical study of the scaling behavior via the power spectrum estimation as a function of the modulus of the wavevector @xmath35 . indeed , the latter method is sensitive to biases in the data , _",
    "e.g. _ smooth polynomial trends , that can easily be shown to drastically affect the power spectrum scaling law .",
    "in addition , this method is appropriate when the fractal signal under consideration is not associated to a unique roughness exponent @xmath36 ( schmittbuhl 1995 ) .",
    "+ using 2d wavelets , we have analyzed our deep continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 image of m1 - 67 to isolate stochastic structures of different characteristic size .",
    "hence we effectively looked for scaling laws , as has been clearly demonstrated in other astrophysical contexts ( _ e.g. _ clumping in co : gill & henriksen 1990 ; clumping in wr winds : lpine 1994 ) . in what follows ,",
    "the deep h@xmath0 image will be considered as a two - dimensional function noted @xmath37 .",

    "the renormalized sum of independent and identically distributed random variables with finite variance has the same probability distribution as the individual terms in the sum . in 1937",
    "lvy showed that the gaussian distribution is but a special case in a wider family of distributions once the constraint of finite variance is relaxed ( feller 1971 ) .",
    "the resulting distributions are referred to as lvy stable distributions , or simply lvy distributions , and are characterized by slowly decaying tails and infinite moments .",
    "lvy distributions , @xmath118 , require four parameters to describe : an index of stability @xmath0 in the interval ( 0,2 ] , a skewness parameter @xmath119 , a scale parameter @xmath120 and a location parameter @xmath33 .",

    "in addition , when we use an infinite variance distribution in order to fit the distribution of velocity increments , all that we are saying is that the observed slowly decaying tails result in behavior similar to that of the infinite variance model . on the whole , we stress the fact that variance is but one measure of spread for a distribution , and is not appropriate for all problems ( painter 1995 ) . + as the scale increases , figure [ levy ] shows us that the distribution approaches a gaussian distribution , as expected for a truncated lvy distribution ( nakao 2000 ) . at small scales ,",
    "the distribution of the velocity increments is characterized by a non - negligible number of extreme events making the pdf of the velocity increments not narrow enough to enable a simple dimensional argument to relate quantitatively all moments : @xmath127 no longer approximates @xmath128 and precludes the determination of any actual ( multi-)fractal structure . at large scales the gaussianity of the pdfs releases this drawback and non - trivial scaling laws may be detected , although likely biased , as seen in figure [ structurem167velo ] .",

    "it provides a simple method to remove noise - like deviations ( independent of morphology ) from a digital image , leaving behind the large - scale structures and overall gradients ( secker 1995 ) .",

    "external forces due to stellar winds ( or gravitation in another astrophysical context like giant molecular clouds : gill & henriksen 1990 ) play an important role in feeding the ism with highly pressurized motions , moving the gas at velocities larger than the sound speed , and ultimately leading to supersonic turbulence and its related small scale compressions . interaction between shock waves and turbulent fluctuations are expected to distribute the energy _",

    "in addition , since our observations come from a projection on the plane of the sky , we therefore expect a smearing of the information along each line of sight .",
    "this may lead to additional perturbations in the flows , with apparently fluctuating power - laws as a function of projected spatial separation ( odell & castaeda 1987 , and references therein ) precluding any inertial regime detection .",

    "<S> bright circumstellar nebulae around massive stars are potentially useful to derive time - dependent mass - loss rates and hence constrain the evolution of the central stars . </S>",
    "<S> a key case in this context is the relatively young ejection - type nebula m1 - 67 around the runaway population i wolf - rayet star wr124 (= 209 bac ) , which exhibits a wn8 spectrum . with hst - wfpc2 we have obtained a deep , h@xmath0 image of m1 - 67 . </S>",
    "<S> this image shows a wealth of complex detail which was briefly presented previously by grosdidier ( 1998 ) . with the interferometer of the universit laval ( qubec , canada ) , </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained complementary fabry - perot h@xmath0 data using cfht mos / sis . </S>",
    "<S> + from these data m1 - 67 appears more - or - less as a spherical ( or elliptical , with the major axis along the line of sight ) , _ thick , shell _ seen almost exactly along its direction of rapid spatial motion away from the observer in the ism . </S>",
    "<S> however , a simple thick shell by itself would not explain the observed multiple radial velocities along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> this velocity dispersion leads one to consider m1 - 67 as a thick _ accelerating _ shell . </S>",
    "<S> given the extreme perturbations of the velocity field in m1 - 67 , it is virtually impossible to measure any systematic impact of the present wr ( or previous lbv ) wind on the nebular structure . </S>",
    "<S> the irregular nature of the velocity field is likely due to either large variations in the density distribution of the ambient ism , or large variations in the central star mass - loss history . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , either from the density field or the velocity field , we find no clear evidence for a bipolar outflow , as was claimed in other studies . </S>",
    "<S> + on the deep h@xmath0 image we have performed continuous wavelet transforms to isolate stochastic structures of different characteristic size and look for scaling laws . </S>",
    "<S> small - scale wavelet coefficients show that the density field of m1 - 67 is remarkably structured in chaotically ( or possibly radially ) oriented _ filaments _ everywhere in the nebula . we draw attention to a short , marginally inertial range at the smallest scales ( 6.715.0 @xmath1 pc ) , which can be attributed to turbulence in the nebula , and a strong scale break at larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> examination of the structure functions for different orders shows that the turbulent regime may be intermittent . </S>",
    "<S> + using our fabry - perot interferograms , we also present an investigation of the statistical properties of fluctuating gas motions using structure functions traced by h@xmath0 emission - line centroid velocities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a clear correlation at scales 0.020.22 pc between the mean quadratic differences of radial velocities and distance over the surface of the nebula . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the velocity field shows an inertial range likely related to turbulence , though not coincident with the small inertial range detected from the density field . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second order moments of the velocity increments are found to scale as @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the former scaling law strongly suggests that supersonic , compressible turbulence is at play in the nebula , on the other hand , the latter scaling law agrees very well with larson - type laws for velocity turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> examination of the structure functions for different orders shows that the turbulent regime is slightly intermittent and highly multifractal with universal multifractal indexes @xmath41.92 and @xmath5 . </S>"
