    "in addition to the coordinate system , now each tile in @xmath3 carries supplementary colors ( from a finite set specified below ) on its sides . on the border of a macro - tile ( i.e. , when one of the coordinates is zero ) only two supplementary colors ( say , @xmath33 and @xmath11 )",

    "each cell carries a bit that is not    r0pt    changed during the computation ; these bits are used as a program for the universal machine ( fig .",

    "proof sketch : since the statement is language - independent ( use translations in both directions before and after @xmath39 ) , we may assume that the programming language has a function ` gettext ( ) ` that returns the text of the program and a function ` exec(string s ) ` that replaces the current process by execution of a program ` s ` .",

    "making these rules a part of @xmath15 s definition ( we let @xmath40 and encode @xmath36 colors by @xmath41 bits ) , we get a program that checks that macro - tiles behave like @xmath3-tiles in this respect .",
    "the only remaining part of the rules for @xmath3 is the hardwired program .",
    "we need to ensure that macro - tiles carry the same program as @xmath3-tiles do . for that our program ( for the universal tm )",
    "needs to access the bits of its own text .",
    "( this self - referential action is in fact quite legal : the program is written on the tape , and the machine can read it . )",
    "the program checks that if a macro - tile belongs to the first line of the computation zone , this macro - tile carries the correct bit of the program .",
    "how should we choose @xmath14 ( hardwired in the program ) ?",
    "we need it to be large enough so the computation described ( which deals with @xmath42 bits ) can fit in the computation zone .",

    "the construction of self - similar tiling is rather flexible and can be easily augmented to get a self - similar tiling with additional properties .",

    "one can check that all configurations that are compatible with this substitution rule ( called _ thue  morse configurations _ in the sequel ) are aperiodic .",
    "the following theorem goes back to  @xcite .",
    "it says that every substitution rule can be enforced by a tile set .",
    "[ substitution - tiling ] let @xmath44 be an alphabet and let @xmath48 be a substitution rule over  @xmath44 .",

    "* proof*. we modify the construction of the tile set @xmath3 ( with zoom factor @xmath14 ) taking @xmath48 into account .",
    "let us first consider the very special case when     the substitution rule maps each @xmath44-letter into an @xmath13-matrix ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) .",

    "we proceed as follows . in our basic construction",
    "every tile knows its coordinates in the macro - tile and some additional information needed to arrange ` wires ' and simulate calculations of the universal tm .",
    "now in addition to this basic structure each tile keeps two letters of @xmath44 : the first is the label of a tile itself , and the second is the label of the @xmath13-tile it belongs to .",

    "it is possible when @xmath48 is easy to compute",
    ".    the requirements ( a ) and ( b ) ensure that configuration is an @xmath48-image of some other configuration .",
    "also ( due the self - similarity ) we have the same at the level of macro - tiles .",
    "but this is not all : we need to guarantee that the first letter on the level of macro - tiles is identical to the second letter on the level of tiles .",
    "this is also achievable : the first letter of a macro - tile is encoded by bits on its border , and we can require that these bits match the second letter of the tiles at that place ( recall that second letter is the same across the macro - tile ) .",
    "it is easy to see that now @xmath3 has the required properties ( each tiling projects into a configuration compatible with  @xmath3 and vice versa ) .",
    "however , this construction assumes that @xmath14 ( the zoom factor ) is equal to the matrix size in the substitution rule , which is usually not the case ( @xmath69 is given , and @xmath14 we have to choose , and it needs to be large enough ) . the solution is to let @xmath14 be equal to @xmath70 for some @xmath25 , and use the substitution rule @xmath71 , i.e. , the @xmath25-th iteration of  @xmath48 ( a configuration is compatible with @xmath71 if and only if it is compatible with @xmath48 ) .",
