    "1.in crystals oriented along main axes the probabilities of photon emission from an electron and @xmath0 pair creation by a photon are strongly enhanced comparing to the corresponding amorphous media .",
    "the example is shown in fig.1 , where the crystal radiation length @xmath1 is the intensity of electron radiation , and the pair creation length @xmath2 is the pair creation probability , are plotted as a function of the corresponding energy .",
    "the both functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are calculated in frame of the new method , developed recently by authors @xcite , which permits inseparable consideration of both coherent and incoherent mechanisms of the process .",
    "it is seen that there are two regions of @xmath5 . in the first one",
    "@xmath5 is almost constant .",
    "this is the incoherent contribution ( or , in other words , the bethe - maximon contribution with the crystal corrections ) .",
    "it is seen that in this region @xmath6 , what means that the probability of pair creation process is still close to the probability in the corresponding amorphous medium while the radiation length @xmath7 ( connected with the electron energy loss ) is strongly enhanced ( mostly due to the soft photons emission ) comparing with the corresponding amorphous medium and the energy loss of electrons and positrons is strongly influenced on the processes .",
    "this is true in the first region where to one can add the vicinity of the turn point of the function @xmath5 at @xmath8 ( see table ) where @xmath9 , e.g. in tungsten at @xmath10gev @xmath11 and in germanium at @xmath12gev @xmath13 . in this ( intermediate ) electron and photon energy region it is impossible to separate the coherent and incoherent contributions to the probability of basic processes . in particular , one ca nt represent the probability as the sum of contribution in the crystal field and the bethe - maximon contribution .",
    "this is because one has to include action of the crystal field on the incoherent process as well as the multiple scattering of emitting electron or particles of created pair for the process in field .",
    "these items were discussed in the authors recent paper @xcite .",
