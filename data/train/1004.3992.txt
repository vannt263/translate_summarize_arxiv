    "the time for this field to grow to values of the order of 1 nt ( or a fraction of it ) is of the order of one or few seconds .",
    "it is usually claimed that the weibel instability stabilizes when the electron gyroradius in the weibel magnetic field becomes comparable to the weibel wavelength . when the electrons are accelerated to @xmath152 kev",
    "energies their gyroradius in a 1  nt magnetic field becomes the order of @xmath153 km , roughly the same order as the above estimated maximum wavelength .",
    "thus the short wavelength weibel field has sufficient time to grow to substantial values until it stabilizes self - consistently by deflecting the current electrons .",
    "prior to this the weibel field has penetrated the current sheet forming vortices and vertexes which serve as seed - x points for reconnection which may then proceed at about along the lines that were discussed long ago in an attempt of formulating a kinetic theory of collisionless reconnection by _",

    "this attempt led to the proposal of a scenario for the spontaneous onset of magnetospheric substorms . in the presence of @xmath154",
    "the current sheet is in a metastable state that goes spontaneously unstable .",
    "the main deficiency of this theory was the lack of any reason for the appearance of @xmath5 . imposing it _",
    "ad hoc _ is the equivalent of igniting reconnection artificially .",
    "what happens in the long wavelength regime ?",
    "here we have @xmath155 km .",
    "the growth time to observable / relevant amplitudes we found to be of the order of @xmath118 s , which is not unreasonable for the processes going on there .",
    "the short wavelength modes grow about ten times faster than the long wavelength modes but may not be of substantial importance for reconnection until they cascade inversely down to longer wavelength structures .",
    "this could be provided by the coalescence of magnetic islands which is strongest at short wavelengths .",
    "the weibel instability in this case excites an entire spectrum of magnetic field structures in the current layer . in the geomagnetic tail",
    "both the short weibel modes and the long wavelengths modes provide seed x - points on geophysically reasonable spatial and temporal scales .",
    "the present approach has so far only implicitly taken into account the narrow width of the non - magnetic central current region which imposes boundary conditions on the evolution of the weibel mode .",
    "continuity of @xmath156 at @xmath79 implies a vanishing @xmath5 here .",
    "as demonstrated , this imposes limits on wave number and propagation angles of the weibel mode .",
    "in addition the presence of a boundary implies that @xmath62 is either parallel or antiparallel .",
    "clearly the parallel case is preferred as the antiparallel case generates small - scale current bifurcation . on the other hand",
    ", this is possible because the evolution of the weibel mode is completely independent of the presence of the external field .",
    "one thus distinguishes between two types of weibel modes depending on their propagation directions @xmath157 .",
    "one of them ( figure [ weibel-1]@xmath77 ) just causes seed - x points , the other ( bi- or trifurcated ) mode may lead to multiple  probably explosive  reconnection ( see figure [ weibel-1]@xmath78 ) .",
    "the reason for an explosive character lies in the fact that on the short scale across the boundary @xmath79 between the inner ( weibel ) current region and the external ( hall ) region the electrons are unmagnetised such that the weibel field can freely expand into @xmath66 until contacting the lobe magnetic field .",
    "this causes spontaneous reconnection between the contacting magnetic flux tubes and will force the inner current sheet to decay into a chain of highly dynamical magnetic islands ( meso - scale plasmoids ) , as is immediately realised from figure [ weibel-1](@xmath78 ) when imagining the resulting magnetic field structure after multiple spontaneous reconnection has set on . in this case",
    ", the inner part of the current layer will become ` turbulent ' ( multiply connected ) on meso - scales the order of the weibel wavelength .",
    "the inner current region decays into a ` magnetic vortex street ' consisting of ( electronic ) plasmoids and seed - x points .",
    "one may ask what structure of the field and current layer is expected in the direction parallel to the current flow .",
    "this question can not be answered without detailed analysis .",
    "however , one may argue that the structure along the current is determined by two facts : the mechanism of electron heating , and the dynamics of the ions .",
    "electron heating occurs in electron holes which have ( short ) longitudinal extension of @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the debye length .",
    "the heating scale is orders of magnitude longer including several to many phase space holes .",
    "however , though it is long , it is still microscopic . in the magnetotail current layer",
    "this length becomes the order of several @xmath160 100 km to few 1000 km only .",
    "hence , one suspects that the tail reconnection structure is inherently three - dimensional putting all two - dimensional models in question .",
    "in addition , the present theory refers to stationary ions .",
    "the ions that carry the tail current move into direction @xmath161 .",
    "hence , the weibel structures and the resulting reconnection sites as a whole move in the direction of the combined speed of the electron holes and current ions .",
    "numerical simulations suggest ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that this direction is _ opposite _ to the electron flow velocity @xmath162 , i.e. in the direction of ion flow .",
    "as a result one expects that the whole set of magnetotail - reconnection sites will displace slowly  roughly at translational velocity of the ion - sound speed @xmath163 km / s  into @xmath161-direction , the direction of ion flow , which in the magnetotail is westward .",
    "this is in accord with observation of the initial westward displacement of substorm sources .",
    "mapping along the stretched magnetic field lines into the ionosphere decreases this translational westward drift speed by about one order of magnitude .    in conclusion",
    ", it is the thermal - anisotropy driven weibel instability which provides the magnetic field to penetrate the inner region of the current layer , generates a local normal field component @xmath5 and , by producing short wavelength magnetic vortices and vertexes , it may ignite reconnection on a time scale of tens of seconds to few minutes in the magnetotail .",
    "this is in rough agreement with observations , e.g. in the magnetotail , and is sufficiently short for initiating magnetospheric substorms .",
    "this logically consistent chain of processes provides a satisfactory mechanism for the spontaneous self - ignited onset of fast magnetic reconnection in thin collisionless current layers .",
