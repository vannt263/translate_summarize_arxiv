    "they are believed to fall into the same universality class as lattice animals  @xcite , so that the critical exponents characterising them are related to those of magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "our own interest in these systems  @xcite is due to the analogy between their behavior and the crumpling of topologically constrained ring polymers  @xcite and , ultimately , chromosomes  @xcite .    as customary in polymer physics  @xcite",
    ", we are primarily interested in exponents describing how expectation values for observables scale with the weight , @xmath2 , of the trees : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 denotes the average branch weight ; @xmath5 the average contour distance or length of paths on the tree ; @xmath6 the mean - square gyration radius of the trees ; and @xmath7 and @xmath8 the mean - square spatial distance and contact probability of nodes as a function of their contour distance , @xmath9 .",
    "the behaviour of trees depends on whether monomers interact or not , whether the tree connectivity is quenched or annealed , and whether the solutions are dilute or dense .",
    "typically , randomly branched polymers are considerably more compact than their linear counterparts . for isolated ,",
    "non - interacting trees @xmath10 compared to @xmath11 for linear chains  @xcite . in @xmath0",
    "the analogy to lattice animals allows to obtain the exact result @xmath11 for isolated , self - avoiding lattice trees with annealed connectivity @xcite . in the polymer context",
    ", one has to distinguish the environmental conditions under which chains are synthesised , from those under which they are studied . while the solvent quality in later experiments may vary",
    ", the chains always preserve a memory of the initial conditions under which their connectivity was `` quenched '' .",
    "thus even if branched polymers can be described as having quenched ideal random connectivity , they fall into different universality class from polymers with annealed connectivity  @xcite and will behave differently when studied in good solvent .",
    "the peculiarity of the crumpled ring polymers is that the branched structure represents transient folding , so that they map to lattice trees with",

    "<S> we confirm that , overall , the theory predicts correctly that trees with quenched ideal connectivity exhibit _ less _ overall swelling in good solvent than corresponding trees with annealed connectivity even though they are _ more strongly _ stretched on the path level . at the same time , we emphasize the inadequacy of the flory theory in predicting the behaviour of other , and equally relevant , observables like contact probabilities between tree nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we show , then , that contact probabilities can be aptly characterized by introducing a novel critical exponent , @xmath1 , which accounts for how they decay as a function of the node - to - node path distance on the tree . </S>"
