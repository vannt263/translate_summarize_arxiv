    "* ) . therefore , prestellar cores are the places that we can study the initial conditions of star formation such as the distribution of density , temperature , and velocity @xcite .",
    "prestellar cores have a constant density in the inner part and a decreasing density at larger radii @xcite , which can be well described with a bonnor - ebert sphere density profile @xcite .",
    "dust grain temperatures decrease toward the center of prestellar cores @xcite since the interstellar radiative field ( isrf ) is the only heating sources of prestellar cores .",
    "although there are several model scenarios to explain core formation , they can be divided into two extreme paradigms : slow quasistatic contraction and dynamic turbulent processes . in the former process ,",
    "a core gradually becomes condensed toward the center through ambipolar diffusion , increasing the ratio of core mass to magnetic flux . as a core switches from magnetically subcritical to a supercritical condition ,",
    "the core can collapse gravitationally @xcite .",
    "if compressible turbulence dominates in a prestellar core , the turbulence will decline in a short time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and collapse will happen .",
    "this means that the prestellar core disappears quickly or rapidly collapses .",
    "the detailed modeling results of this process suggest that the cores live for only one or two free - fall times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "demographic studies indicate lifetimes that decline with increasing density from near 10 free - fall times at @xmath8 @xmath7 to a few free - fall times , or about 0.5 myr , once the mean density rises above @xmath9  @xmath7 , and one free - fall time once the mean density is above @xmath10  @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "@xcite observed several molecular species and suggested two possibilities for the chemical difference along the tmc-1 filament .",
    "one was a small variation in the c / o ratio from 0.4 to 0.5 .",
    "another was that differences in density , which varies by a factor of 2 along the filament , could explain the difference of chemical distribution in the tmc-1 filament .",
    "the latter was consistent with the result by @xcite because the higher density could drive chemical processes more rapidly .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a ch abundance gradient in tmc-1 , from @xmath121.0@xmath1910@xmath20 in the northwestern part to @xmath122.0@xmath1910@xmath20 in the southeastern part of tmc-1 , and they noted that the ch column density peaks close to the cyanopolyyne peak .",
    "they suggested that the southeastern part in the vicinity of the cyanopolyyne peak had an extensive low - density envelope based on the comparison of the dust continuum maps from scuba 850 and 450  @xmath21 @xcite and the modelling of molecular lines @xcite , implying that the cyanopolyyne peak was in the early stage of dynamical evolution and this peak was also chemically less evolved than the ammonia peak because of the lower density .",
    "@xcite proposed another explanation for molecular abundance differences along the tmc-1 filament .",
    "they investigated the possibility that the gradients were produced by spontaneous explosive desorption of uv - photolyzed ice mantles , triggered by the heating of dust grains and their ices , through grain - grain collisions induced by mhd waves from iras 04381 + 2540 near the ammonia peak .",
    "the chemical processes occurred first in the ammonia peak and later in the cyanopolyyne peak , which induced the gradient of molecular abundances along the tmc-1 filament . according to their chemical models , the ammonia peak is 1.5@xmath1910@xmath18  yr older than the cyanopolyyne peak , assuming the speed of the mhd wave of 2  km  s@xmath22 .    a very different explanation for the chemical distribution along the tmc-1 filament might be possible .",
    "according to gas - phase chemical models , carbon - chain species such as ccs form before atomic carbon mainly reacts with atomic oxygen , which drives all carbon - bearing species into co. when the depletion of co ( and even n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) is very significant , abundances of carbon - chain species increase again , which is called a late - time secondary abundance peak of carbon - chain species @xcite . in this case",
    ", the cyanopolyyne peak might be chemically older than the ammonia peak , unlike the conclusion from the rest of the studies .",
    "therefore , we need to calculate accurate depletion factors of n@xmath1h@xmath2 and co in the two peaks using accurate h@xmath1 column densities .    in this study , we present new data from the fcrao ( five college radio astronomy observatory ) 14-m telescope and the srao ( seoul radio astronomy observatory ) 6-m telescope , along with data from the _ spitzer _ space telescope and mambo ( max - planck millimetre bolometer ) at the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "we combine these data sets to study the reason for the chemical differentiation along the filament .",
    "we determine the degree of molecular depletion by comparing column densities calculated from dust continuum emission and molecular line emission , since the dust continuum at ( sub)millimeter traces the total material along the line of sight very well .",
