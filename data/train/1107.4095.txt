    "the massive black holes ( mbhs ) that reside at the centers of some nearby galaxies are believed to grow together with their hosts through mergers : mbhs grow partly as a result of gas accretion , and partly by coalescence with other mbhs that are brought into the nucleus during the merger process @xcite .",
    "the detailed assembly history of mbhs is poorly understood ; major uncertainties include the `` seed '' mass distribution of mbhs at high redshift , the typical gas accretion efficiency , and the frequency with which mbhs are ejected due to gravitational - wave recoil @xcite .",
    "but a robust prediction of the hierarchical models is that galaxies hosting mbhs in the nearby universe were formed from less massive systems , at least some of which already contained mbhs .",
    "binary mbhs created during galaxy mergers leave imprints on the stellar distribution : for instance , they create low - density cores , by exchanging energy with passing stars @xcite .",
    "such cores are observed to be ubiquitous in stellar spheroids brighter than @xmath1 @xcite and their sizes  of order the influence radius of the ( presumably single ) mbh  are consistent with the predictions of merger models @xcite .",
    "here we define the influence radius as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rms velocity of stars in any direction at @xmath4 .",
    "cores of radius @xmath5 become difficult to resolve in galaxies beyond the local group if the mbh mass is below @xmath6 . even in the nearest nucleus , that of the milky way , the presence of a parsec - scale core around sgr a@xmath7 was only clearly established in the last few years @xcite .    in the absence of mbhs",
    ", mergers tend to preserve the form of the stellar distribution near the centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "binary mbhs , however , are efficient at erasing the structure that was present on scales @xmath8 @xcite , and this fact precludes drawing definite conclusions about the nuclear properties of the galaxies that preceded the hosts of observed mbhs . on the other hand , it is well established that low - luminosity galaxies have higher central densities than high - luminosity galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is true both in terms of the mean density within the half - mass radius , and also in terms of the density on the smallest resolvable scales : low - luminosity spheroids often contain dense , nuclear stars clusters ( nscs ) , with sizes of order @xmath9 and masses @xmath10 the mass of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "nsc masses are therefore comparable to , or somewhat greater than , mbh masses @xcite , although nscs have been shown to coexist with mbhs in only a handful of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the nsc in the milky way is believed to be a representative example : its half - light radius is @xmath11 , or @xmath12 , and its mass is a few times @xmath13 , or several times @xmath14 @xcite .    in the nsc of the milky way ,",
    "the two - body relaxation time is comparable with the age of the universe , and this is consistent with the persistence of a core ( as opposed to a @xcite cusp ) in the late - type stars @xcite .",
    "but in fainter systems , central relaxation times are shorter .",
    "for instance , in the virgo cluster , galaxies with nscs have nuclear half - light relaxation times that scale with host - galaxy luminosity as @xcite t_r,1.210 ^ 10 ( ) . by comparison ,",
    "the mean time between `` major mergers '' ( mergers with mass ratios @xmath15 or less ) of dark - matter haloes in the hierarchical models varies from @xmath16 gyr at redshift @xmath17 to @xmath18 yr at @xmath19 , with a weak dependence on halo mass @xcite .",
    "this comparison suggests that the progenitors of many spheroids in the current universe may have been galaxies containing nuclei that were able to attain a collisionally - relaxed state before the merger that formed them took place .    in the absence of a mbh",
    ", collisional relaxation implies mass segregation and core collapse .",
    "if a mbh is present , mass segregation still occurs , but core collapse is inhibited by the fixed potential due to the mbh . a collisional steady state , which is reached by a time @xmath20 at radii @xmath21 , is characterized by a bahcall - wolf , @xmath22 cusp in the dominant component at @xmath23 .",
    "if there is a mass spectrum , less - massive objects follow a shallower profile , @xmath24 , while more - massive objects follow a steeper profile , @xmath25 @xcite .    as a first approximation",
    ", the mass spectrum of an evolved stellar population can be represented in terms of just two components : objects of roughly one solar mass or less ( main - sequence stars , white dwarfs , neutron stars ) ; and remnant black holes ( bhs ) with masses @xmath26 .",
    "standard initial mass functions predict that roughly @xmath27 of the total mass will be in stellar bhs @xcite ; so - called `` top - heavy '' mass functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict a larger fraction . in a collisionally relaxed nucleus",
    ", the density of stellar bhs will rise more steeply toward the center than the density of the stars .",
    "mergers between galaxies with such nuclei would be expected to modify these steady - state distributions substantially , and also to affect ( increase ) the time scale over which a collisionally relaxed cusp could be regenerated following the merger @xcite .",
    "these arguments motivated us to carry out merger simulations between galaxies containing multi - component , mass - segregated nuclei around mbhs . as in previous papers from this series @xcite , our merger simulations are purely stellar - dynamical . in some galaxies",
    ", torques from gas would assist in the evolution of binary mbhs @xcite .",
    "gas also implies star formation , and there is evidence for complex star formation histories in many nscs @xcite .",
    "but @xmath0-body simulations that allow for non - spherical geometries @xcite have shown that purely dissipationless energy exchange with ambient stars can bring binary mbhs to milliparsec separations on time scales much shorter than galaxy lifetimes . unless the late evolution of the binary mbh is greatly accelerated by torques from the gas , the influence of the binary on the distribution of the _ stellar _ populations should be accurately reproduced by our dissipationless models . with respect to star formation , population synthesis of nsc spectra suggest that most of the mass typically resides in stars with ages of order 5 - 10 gyr @xcite , i.e. an old population .    simulating the merger of galaxy - sized systems , while enforcing the spatial and temporal resolution required to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of stars on scales @xmath28 around the central mbh , is computationally demanding .",
    "our simulations used @xmath29 particles per galaxy , and the models were advanced using a parallel , direct - summation @xmath0-body code @xcite .",
    "the integrations were accelerated using special - purpose hardware .",
    "the galaxy models contained four mass groups , representing an evolved stellar population .",
    "initial conditions of the merging galaxies were constructed in a two - stage process : models of mass - segregated nuclei around a mbh were first constructed , then these collisionally - relaxed models were imbedded into larger , spheroid - sized models .",
    "mergers were then carried out , assuming a galaxy mass ratio of @xmath30 .",
    "a major motivation for our new simulations was the need to understand the distribution of stellar remnants , particularly stellar - mass bhs , near the centers of galaxies .",
    "knowledge of the bh density well inside @xmath31 is crucial for predicting the rates of many astrophysically interesting processes ; in particular , the rate of capture of stellar - mass bhs by mbhs , or emris @xcite .",
    "published emri rate calculations almost always assume a state of mass segregation , implying a high density of stellar remnants near the mbh @xcite . however , in a nucleus formed via a merger , any pre - existing mass segregation would have been disrupted by the binary mbh when it created a core ; whether or not the massive remnants would have had time to re - segregate following the merger is difficult to assess without full @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "our simulations followed the evolution of the binary mbhs for a time almost long enough that gravitational wave emission would dominate the binaries evolution .",
    "we then combined the two mbh particles into one , simulating gravitational wave coalescence , and continued the @xmath0-body integrations for a time corresponding to several relaxation times at the ( new ) influence radius . in this post - merger evolutionary phase",
    ", we also considered the consequences of varying the relative numbers of the different mass components . in this way",
    ", we were able , for the first time , to observe how rapidly the stellar bhs would re - segregate following a merger .",
    "we found substantially longer time scales for this evolution than in earlier simulations that started from physically less motivated initial conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : models ] we describe the procedure to generate equilibrium segregated models starting from single - component models . scaling to physical units is discussed in section  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "evolution of the binary mbh and its effects on the underlying stellar distribution are described in section  [ sec : premerger ] . in section  [ sec : postmerger ] we describe the evolution of the light and heavy objects after the massive binary has undergone coalescence .",
    "section  [ sec : shape ] describes the shapes and kinematics of the merger remnants .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses the implications of our results for the formation and observability of bahcall - wolf cusps , and for the distribution of stellar remnants .",
    "multi - mass fokker - planck models have been constructed for stars around a mbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . extending these models beyond @xmath31  where the stellar distributions are expected to be unrelaxed and where the gravitational potential contains contributions from stars as well as from the mbh  is problematic",
    "instead , we used @xmath0-body integrations to create models of galaxies with collisionally - relaxed nuclei .",
    "the major difficulty was obtaining sufficient resolution on the scale of the relaxed density cusp , without using a prohibitively large number of particles overall . in brief",
    ", we proceeded as follows .",
    "\\1 . a mass - segregated model of the inner parts of a galaxy containing a mbh was created via @xmath0-body integrations , starting from a configuration in which the different mass groups all had the same phase - space distribution .",
    "this model had a total mass of @xmath32 ; scaled to a galaxy like the milky way , the outer radius of the model would be @xmath33 .",
    "smooth representations of the density profiles were constructed for each of the @xmath0-body species at the end of the integration .",
    "these functions were then `` spliced '' onto a larger , unrelaxed model , at a radius where the effects of mass segregation were essentially zero .",
    "this larger model had a mass of @xmath34 , or roughly @xmath35 the mass of an entire stellar spheroid .",
    "the smooth functions representing the different mass components in this larger model were used to generate monte - carlo positions and velocities as initial conditions for the @xmath0-body integrations .",
    "two such @xmath0-body models , with different total masses and radii , were placed in orbit around each other and integrated forward until the two mbh particles had formed a tightly - bound pair at the center . at this time , the merged galaxy contained a large , low - density core created by the binary mbh .",
    "the two mbh particles were combined into a single particle and the merged galaxy was re - sampled using a smaller @xmath0 .",
    "this model was then integrated forward for a few central relaxation times , allowing the different mass groups to again evolve toward a collisional steady state near the center .    in more detail ,",
    "the mass - segregated models described in step 1 were created as follows .",
    "initial conditions were generated from a density law having roughly the expected , steady - state distribution near the mbh .",
    "we used the modified prugniel - simien ( 1997 ) model described by @xcite , which has a central density cusp of adjustable slope : @xmath36^{\\gamma/\\alpha } \\left[\\left(r^\\alpha+r_s^\\alpha\\right)/r_\\mathrm{ps}^\\alpha\\right]^{-p/\\alpha } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp\\left\\{-b\\left[(r^\\alpha+r_s^\\alpha)/r_\\mathrm{ps}^\\alpha\\right]^{1/{n\\alpha } } \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] setting @xmath37 in the first term gives @xmath38 near the center , which is close to the collisionally - relaxed density profile expected for the dominant population in a multi - mass cusp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter @xmath39 determines the extent of the cusp ; in relaxed , single - component models , @xmath40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter @xmath41 sets the power - law slope beyond the central cusp ; we set @xmath42 , i.e. a relatively constant density like that of the nuclear stellar disk of the milky way .",
    "the two final terms on the right hand side of equation([eq : cps ] ) mimic a deprojected srsic - law galaxy , with @xmath43 the srsic index ; the parameter @xmath44 can be related to @xmath43 if @xmath45 is identified with the effective radius @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the exponential term is invoked only to provide a sharp truncation to the model outside of @xmath46 a few @xmath31 ; we set @xmath47 .",
    "given these parameters , and setting @xmath48 , we could then solve for the cusp radius @xmath39 in units of the model scale - length @xmath45 : @xmath49 .",
    "the result is shown as the thin dotted curve in figure[fig : rhoinit ] .    ) .",

    "each curve represents the combined density of eight independent integrations with 132k particles .",

    "the nsc model was assumed to be made up of four discrete mass groups .",
    "the relative values of the particle masses were @xmath60 .",

    "our choices could also be seen as corresponding to a `` top - heavy '' initial mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our post - merger simulations",
    ", we explored the consequences of varying these ratios .",
    "initial positions and velocities of particles from the four mass groups were generated in a standard way : ( i ) the gravitational potential @xmath63 was computed from the known mass distribution ( equation[eq : cps ] ) plus the central mbh particle .",

    "the lighter populations evolve less , as expected , since their distribution was close to the steady - state form at the start ( by design ) .",
    "the final density profiles of the four populations are shown in figure[fig : rhoinit ] .",
    "the bhs follow @xmath74 at @xmath75 , and they dominate the total ( mass ) density inside @xmath76 .",
    "the density cusp defined by the less massive populations is nearly unchanged aside from a slight expansion due to heating by the bhs .",

    "it follows the same density law as in equation([eq : cps ] ) , but with larger scale length @xmath77 .",
    "the imbedding was achieved as follows : smoothed density profiles were constructed from each of the four mass groups in the evolved @xmath0-body model ( the same functions plotted in figure[fig : rhoinit ] ) .",
    "these smooth profiles were then matched onto the density of the extended model at a radius @xmath78 ; beyond this radius , essentially no evolution occurred in the @xmath0-body integrations and so the @xmath0-body density profiles ( with appropriate vertical scalings ) matched well onto the analytic profile .",
    "a small degree of smoothing was nevertheless necessary near the matching radius to keep the first derivatives of the density continuous .",
    "finally , small ( a few percent ) adjustments were made in the vertical normalizations of the four density profiles in order to recover precisely the original ratios between the total numbers of the four species .",

    "the radius of the smaller bulge was scaled as the square - root of the bulge mass .",
    "particle masses ( aside from the mbh particle ) were the same in the two bulges , i.e. , particle number scaled linearly with total mass .",
    "table[tab : models1 ] lists the important parameters of the merging systems : the mass ratio of the two mbhs ( equal to the galaxy mass ratio ) , the ratio of mbh mass to host bulge mass , the ratio of the ms stars mass to mbh mass , the number of particles in each galaxy , and the initial separation between the bulge centers , @xmath82 , expressed in units of the outer radius of the larger bulge , @xmath83 .",

    "in fact , as we now argue , the mechanism driving the evolution of the lighter component at small radii is not mass segregation ; it is scattering of the light component by the heavy component @xcite .",
    "consider a two - component system ; as before , species no .",
    "1 is the light ( ms ) component and species no .",

    "a moderate triaxiality is present in both models at distances of the order of @xmath211 from the binary center of mass . at larger distances ,",
    "the models appear axisymmetric with a small flattening in the direction perpendicular to the binary orbital plane .",
    "these features persist throughout the hardening phase .",
    "the flattening , due to rotation of the merger remnant , is also visible in the isophotes shown in figure[fig : isophotes ] , which are computed at the beginning of the post - merger phase .",
    "rotation is introduced by the merger process , as illustrated by the velocity map in figure[fig : vel ] for model a. the figure shows the direction and magnitude of the velocities in the binary s orbital plane . by the time the binary reaches the hard binary separation , a well defined rotation pattern has been established .    the departures from spherical symmetry that we observe in the merger models are probably responsible for the efficient hardening of the massive binary @xcite .",
    "in galaxies containing a single stellar population , a @xmath212 @xcite cusp is expected to appear at radii @xmath213 around the mbh . while the growth time of the cusp is dependent on the initial conditions , simulations starting from a shallow cusp inside @xmath84",

    "figure[fig : fp_g0.5_slopes ] showed that addition of the bhs reduces slightly the rate of formation of a bahcall - wolf cusp in the ms ( light ) component , and also affects the final value of the density - profile slope , which varies from @xmath214 when @xmath215 is small , to @xmath216 as @xmath215 is increased @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the initial ms distribution is very flat near the mbh , scattering by the heavier bhs can dominate the evolution of the ms component at early times for @xmath157 , converting @xmath217 to @xmath218 at these small radii , even before the bahcall - wolf cusp has fully formed at larger radii .",
    "the full galaxy merger simulations presented here allowed us , for the first time , to evaluate the evolution of multi - component nuclei starting from initial conditions that were motivated by a well - defined physical model .",
    "our pre - merger galaxies contained mass - segregated nuclei with four mass components , representing an evolved stellar population .",
    "these initial distributions were modified both by the galaxy merger , and by the formation of a mbh binary , which created a large core in each of the components ( figures[fig : lagr1 ] , [ fig : density ] ) .",
    "the core radius of the heaviest ( bh ) component was somewhat smaller than the cores in the three lighter components , a relic of the earlier mass segregation , and of the incomplete cusp destruction process during the binary mbh phase ( figure[fig : density ] ) .",
    "evolution during the merger phase set the `` initial conditions '' of the nucleus at the time when the two mbhs were combined into one . unlike the rather ad hoc initial conditions used in many earlier studies of nuclear evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our post - merger models have cores that should be reasonable representations of the cores in real galaxies that formed via dissipationless mergers , with mass densities that decline toward the center and anisotropic kinematics that reflect the action of the massive binary on the stellar orbits ( figure[fig : vel ] ) .    by continuing the evolution of these multi - component models for a time greater than @xmath219 after coalescence of the two mbhs",
    ", we found that the cores characterizing the distribution of the dominant , ms component persisted ; in fact the ms density at radii @xmath220 decreased gradually with time ( figure  [ fig : massp ] )  a predictable consequence of the initial extent of the cores , several times @xmath84 , implying @xmath221 , and of continued `` heating '' by the heavier bhs .",
    "nevertheless , a bahcall - wolf cusp gradually reformed in the lighter components at radii @xmath222 ; growth times were found to be @xmath223 , somewhat greater than in earlier models with more idealized initial conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our pre - merger galaxies ( models a1 , b1 ) contained larger numbers of remnants than would be expected based on a standard imf ; this was done in order to better resolve the distributions of those components near the mbh .",
    "we tested the dependence of the _ post_-merger evolution on the assumed mass function by carrying out a second set of integrations in which we decreased the relative numbers of remnants ( ns , wd , bh ) by factors of a few , to values more consistent with standard imfs ( models a2 , b2 ) .",
    "evolution of the dominant , ms component in the latter models differed only modestly from its evolution in the models with larger remnant fractions ; the main difference was a lower rate of core expansion reflecting a lower rate of heating by the bhs ( figure[fig : massp ] ) .",
    "the rate of growth of the bahcall - wolf cusp in the ms component was essentially unchanged ( figure[fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "our results on the regeneration of bahcall - wolf cusps following dissipationless mergers are consistent with those obtained in simulations of single - component galaxies @xcite .",
    "we can summarize these results by stating that regrowth of a cusp in the dominant stellar component requires a time comparable with , or somewhat longer than , the relaxation time of that component measured at the mbh influence radius .",
    "the new simulations presented here suggest that time scales for cusp regrowth are only weakly dependent on the number of heavy remnants ( bhs ) , at least if the fraction of mass in the heavier population does not exceed a few percent of the total .",
    "the milky way nucleus is near enough that a bahcall - wolf cusp could be resolved if present , and the dominant stellar population is believed to be old . since @xmath224 in the milky way , the expected , outer radius of the bahcall - wolf cusp is @xmath225 . as is well known , number counts of the dominant , old stellar population show no evidence of a rise in density at this radius ; instead the number counts are flat , or even falling , from @xmath226 into at least @xmath227 projected radius @xcite .    assuming solar - mass stars , the relaxation time at the influence radius of sgr a@xmath7 is 20 - 30 gyr @xcite , while the mean stellar age in the nuclear star cluster is estimated to be @xmath228 gyr @xcite .",
    "the time available for formation of a cusp is therefore @xmath229 .",
    "our simulations ( e.g. figure[fig : profiles ] ) suggest that a bahcall - wolf cusp in the dominant component is unlikely to have formed in so short a time , and this is consistent with the lack of a bahcall - wolf cusp at the galactic center .",
    "the core in the milky way has a radius of @xmath182 , somewhat smaller than @xmath31 or @xmath84 , while the cores formed in our merger models are somewhat larger than @xmath84 ( table 4 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the milky way core is small enough that gravitational encounters would cause it to shrink appreciably in 10 gyr , as the stellar distribution evolves toward a bahcall - wolf cusp @xcite .",
    "the cores in our @xmath0-body models are so large that they do not evolve appreciably after the binary mbh has been replaced by a single mbh ; the bahcall - wolf cusp forms at radii smaller than @xmath230 , leaving the core structure essentially unchanged . without necessarily advocating a merger model for the origin of the milky way core (",
    "it is unclear whether our galaxy even contains a bulge ; @xcite ) , we note that the sizes of cores formed by binary mbhs scale with the binary mass ratio . presumably , we could have produced cores more similar in size to the milky way s if we had adjusted this ratio .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that heating by bhs could be responsible for the lack of a bahcall - wolf cusp at the galactic center .",
    "we do not find support for this hypothesis , either in our four - component @xmath0-body models , nor in our two - component fokker - planck models .",
    "the latter showed that even a quite large bh population still allowed a bahcall - wolf cusp to form in the ms stars on a time scale of @xmath231 ; the main effect of the bhs is to decrease the asymptotic slope of the cusp from @xmath232 to @xmath216 .",
    "a dense cluster of stellar - mass bhs has been invoked as a potential solution to a number of problems of collisional dynamics at the galactic center .",
    "examples include randomization of the orbits of young stars via gravitational scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , production of hyper - velocity stars through encounters with bhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and warping of young stellar disks @xcite .",
    "these treatments typically assume a collisionally - relaxed state for the galactic center . in the relaxed models , the mass in bhs inside @xmath233 is @xmath234 , i.e. @xmath235 and @xmath236 @xcite , assuming `` standard '' imfs . a high density of stellar bhs at the centers of galaxies like the milky way is also commonly assumed in discussions of the emri ( extreme - mass - ratio inspiral ) problem @xcite .",
    "models like these are called into question by the lack of a bahcall - wolf cusp in the late - type stars at the center of the milky way @xcite .",
    "if the galactic center is not collisionally relaxed , as these observations seem to suggest , then computing the distribution of the heavy remnants becomes a more difficult , time - dependent problem @xcite , and knowledge of the initial conditions is essential .",
    "dissipationless mergers imply `` initial conditions '' characterized by a core in the dominant stellar component .",
    "the cores formed in our ( major ) merger simulations are large enough that they do not evolve appreciably ( i.e. shrink ) even after @xmath237 relaxation times at the mbh influence radius . as a result ,",
    "evolution of the bh distribution takes place against a stellar background with a very different density profile than in the steady - state models . in a core around a mbh ,",
    "dynamical friction is much weaker than one would estimate by plugging the local density into standard formulae for orbital decay , due to the absence of stars moving more slowly than the local circular velocity @xcite .",
    "scaling our @xmath0-body models to the milky way , we predicted numbers of bhs inside @xmath31 that were substantially smaller than in the collisionally relaxed models ; in the inner @xmath238  the radii most relevant to the emri problem @xcite  the number of bhs was , at most , 10 - 100 times smaller than predicted by these models , even after 10 gyr ( figure[fig : bhs ] ) .    it is unclear how relevant merger models are to the center of the milky way .",
    "if the core observed at the galactic center had some other origin , the distribution of stellar bhs might have little connection with the distribution of the giant stars .",
    "however , if cores of size @xmath239 are common features of galactic nuclei , and if at some early time both the bhs and the stars had a common core radius , our models imply that the distribution of bhs should be considered very uncertain , even in galaxies for which nuclear half - mass relaxation times are as short as the age of the universe .",
