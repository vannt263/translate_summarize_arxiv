    "the resonant bragg structures have been first considered theoretically in ref .   and then investigated experimentally in systems based on semiconductor compounds",
    "a@xmath0b@xmath1 @xcite and a@xmath2b@xmath3 @xcite . the further progress in understanding of optical properties of resonant bragg structures has been achieved in a series of theoretical studies @xcite . in resonant bragg structures without the dielectric contrast , i.e. , with the coinciding dielectric constants , @xmath4 , of the barrier material and the background dielectric constant , @xmath5 , of the quantum well ( qw )",
    ", the optical reflection spectrum for small enough number @xmath6 of wells is described by a lorentzian with the halfwidth @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , exciton radiative and nonradiative damping rates  @xcite . for a very large number of wells",
    "the reflection coefficient is close to unity within the forbidden gap for exciton polaritons and rapidly decreases near the gap edges @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the exciton resonance frequency and @xmath13  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the reflection spectra are calculated for arbitrary values of @xmath6 , including the intermediate region where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are comparable .",
    "the calculations have demonstrated an existence of two particular frequencies : near these special frequencies a value of the reflection coefficient from the resonant bragg structure with the matched dielectric constants is practically independent of the qw number and very close to that for reflection from a semi - infinite homogeneous medium with the refractive index @xmath16 . in the present paper",
    "we give an analytical interpretation for this effect .",
    "moreover , we analyze the role of dielectric contrast @xmath17 in the formation of the special frequencies in the reflection spectra .",
    "the structure under consideration is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "1 : it borders vacuum in the left and contains the cap layer of the thickness @xmath18 made from the material b , @xmath6 qws made from the material a , each of the width @xmath19 , separated by the barriers of the thickness @xmath20 and the semi - infinite medium b. under normal incidence ( from vacuum ) of the light wave of the frequency @xmath21 , the amplitude reflection coefficient can be written in the following form  @xcite @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the reflection coefficient `` vacuum @xmath24 semi - infinite medium b '' , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the light velocity in vacuum , @xmath28 is the reflection coefficient from the structure with @xmath6 qws placed between the infinite barriers .",
    "it is convenient to refer the phase of the latter coefficient to the plane shifted by @xmath29 from the center of the leftmost qw .",
    "then this coefficient is given by @xcite @xmath30 where the complex coefficients @xmath31 describe the reflection from and transmission through the layer of the thickness @xmath32 containing a qw in its center , @xmath33 is the wave vector of an exciton polariton at the frequency @xmath21 in an infinite regular qw structure . for a structure without the dielectric contrast one has @xcite",

    "@xmath35 is the electric field amplitude of the incident light wave , and the reflection coefficient @xmath36 is defined as a ratio of the reflected amplitude to @xmath35 . ]",
    "2 shows the reflection spectra from the resonant bragg structure with matched dielectric constants .",
    "the spectra are calculated in the absence of the nonradiative damping ( a ) and for @xmath37 ( b ) .",
    "the rest parameters are indicated in the figure caption . in agreement with @xcite ,",
    "one can see in the spectra presented in figs .",
    "2a and 2b that for two frequencies labelled @xmath38 and @xmath39 the reflection coefficient @xmath40 is indeed close to @xmath41 and almost independent of @xmath6 , at least for @xmath42 .",
    "the special frequencies are tied to the exciton - polariton forbidden - gap edges @xmath43 in such a way that @xmath44 on the other hand , the reflection coefficient @xmath45 from the semi - infinite structure ( curves @xmath46 in figs .",
    "2a and 2b ) shows abrupt change from values close to unity at @xmath47 ( or equal unity at @xmath48 ) inside the forbidden gap to values @xmath49 in the adjoining allowed bands . for large but finite values of @xmath6 exceeding @xmath50 ,",
    "the reflection spectrum @xmath51 from the structure with @xmath52 is close to @xmath53 while at @xmath54 the spectrum strongly oscillates outside the gap region with the period decreasing as @xmath6 increases .     from @xmath6-qw structure with the matched dielectric constants of compositional materials",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 . the calculation is performed for the background refractive index @xmath57 , the exciton resonance frequency and radiative damping rate defined by @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and the nonradiative damping rate @xmath61 ( a ) and @xmath62 ( b ) .",
    "curves correspond to six structures with different number of qws indicated at each curve .",
    "the reflection spectrum for the structure with infinite number of qws , @xmath63 , is labelled by the symbol @xmath46 . ]",
    "an existence of the special frequencies @xmath64 in the reflection spectra can be understood if one notices that in the vicinity of the edge frequencies @xmath65 , where @xmath66 the ratio of the sine functions in can be approximated by @xmath67 therefore , the reflection coefficient @xmath68 and , hence , the reflection coefficient can be presented as the mbius or linear - fractional transformation @xmath69 with @xmath70 it should be noted that this equation is valid for an arbitrary regular structure with @xmath6 periods if @xmath31 are considered as the reflection and transmission coefficients for a single layer of the thickness @xmath71 embedded between the semi - infinite media with the refractive index @xmath16 . in the particular case of an @xmath6-qw structure with the matched dielectric constants we have instead of ( [ genabgd ] ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 and , for the sake of convenience , the coefficients used here differ from those in ( [ genabgd ] ) by the common factor @xmath74 , which makes no change in the transformation eq .",
    "( [ rfraclinear ] ) .",
    "let us continue analytically the dependence @xmath36 to the whole complex plane @xmath75 and take into account that the linear - fractional transformation @xmath76 sends a circle to a circle , a straight line can be considered as a circle of the infinite radius , and the points @xmath77 lie on the real axis .",
    "it follows then that the complex values @xmath36 lie on the circle of some radius @xmath78 centered at some point @xmath79 so that one has @xmath80 where only the phase @xmath81 is @xmath6-dependent .",
    "the values of @xmath79 and @xmath78 are related to @xmath82 and @xmath83 by @xcite @xmath84 according to ( [ rnwr ] ) we have @xmath85 if there exists a frequency @xmath21 where @xmath79 vanishes ( or is very close to zero ) then the reflection coefficient @xmath86 at this frequency is independent ( or almost independent ) of @xmath6 and equal ( or almost equal ) to @xmath87 .",
    "if this frequency satisfies the condition @xmath88 , the exciton contribution to the reflectivity is negligible for small @xmath6 and values of @xmath86 are mainly determined by the reflection on the boundary between vacuum and material b. thus , for small @xmath6 the inequality @xmath89 is valid . since @xmath90 is negligible the same condition is satisfied not only for small @xmath6 but for all those @xmath6 which allow the representation of @xmath36 in the form of linear - fractional transformation .",
    "the calculation shows that , for the structure characterized by the parameters indicated in the caption to fig .  2 , the special frequencies correspond to @xmath91 , and the ratio @xmath92 reaches a minimal value of @xmath93 for @xmath54 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 @xmath96ev . at the same time @xmath97",
    "differs from unity less than by @xmath98 . in order to derive approximate analytical expressions for the frequencies @xmath64",
    "we can expand the coefficients @xmath99 in in powers of small parameters @xmath100 or @xmath101 . substituting the obtained approximate equations into and solving the equation @xmath102",
    "we find @xmath103 for @xmath57 the ratio @xmath104 following from this equation differs from the numerical result only by @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the closeness of the frequencies @xmath64 to the gap edges is determined by a large value of the dielectric constant @xmath106 .",
    "we see that the approximation of @xmath36 by a linear - fractional transformation ( [ rfraclinear ] ) and a smallness of the minimal value of the function @xmath90 allows one to explain the existence of special frequencies @xmath64 .",
    "in contrast to the absolute value of the reflection coefficient @xmath107 which is practically independent of the qw number , the phase of the reflected wave @xmath108 appreciably changes with increasing @xmath6 and is described with a good accuracy by the linear function @xmath109 in fig .",
    "3 squares show the exact values of @xmath86 at the frequency @xmath38 and the solid curve shows the approximate dependence @xmath110 obtained by the substitution of into .",
    "one can see that the approximate formula reproduces the results of numerical calculation with high accuracy .     on the number of qws at the frequency @xmath111 .",
    "the parameters coincide with those indicated in the caption to fig .  2 .",
    "the exact values for the structure with @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath96ev are shown by squares and triangles , respectively .",
    "solid and dotted curves represent the analytical approximation for @xmath112 and @xmath114 . ]    fig .",
    "2b presents the spectra @xmath51 calculated with allowance for exciton nonradiative damping @xmath115 .",
    "one can see that the nonradiative damping leads to a decrease of the reflection coefficient near the center of the forbidden gap but makes no remarkable effect on the position of the special frequencies @xmath64 .",
    "near these frequencies the phase of the complex coefficient @xmath36 is also described by eq .  .",
    "however the dependence of @xmath116 on @xmath6 for @xmath117 shown in fig .",
    "3 by triangles essentially differs from that for @xmath112 . for the description of this dependence",
    "it is not enough to take into account the variation of @xmath81 given by eq .",
    "the reason is that , for nonzero nonradiative damping , the condition for validity of the approximation is violated at noticeably smaller @xmath6 than in the case of vanishing @xmath9 . as a result one has to keep the next nonvanishing term in the expansion of the ratio of sine functions in powers of the variable @xmath118 , namely , @xmath119 this expansion is valid for @xmath120 .",
    "since the factor @xmath121 differs from unity the dependence @xmath36 obtained in the approximation ( [ deff ] ) is not , strictly speaking , linear - fractional : the coefficients @xmath122 become functions of @xmath6 and , therefore , the transformation @xmath36 no more sends the real axis to a perfect circle .",
    "formally , the expression @xmath36 can be presented in the form ( [ rnwr ] ) .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath9 can be neglected . however , both @xmath79 and the real factor @xmath78 are now functions of @xmath6",
    ". triangles and dotted curve in fig .  3 present results of exact and approximate calculations of the coefficient @xmath86 at the frequency @xmath38 for @xmath123 100 @xmath96ev .",
    "the approximate calculation is carried out according to eq .",
    "( [ rn ] ) , but with modified @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "for nonzero nonradiative - damping rate , values of @xmath33 become complex even in the allowed bands .",
    "the analysis shows that it is the imaginary part of @xmath33 which gives rise to the difference between the solid and dotted curves in fig .",
    "for @xmath124 , the reflection and transmission coefficients for a single qw are described by @xcite :    @xmath125    here @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated neglecting the exciton contribution and given as follows @xmath128 where @xmath129 . the exciton contribution to @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    "has the form @xmath132 where @xmath133 as well as in the case @xmath134 , the reflection coefficient from an @xmath6-qw structure is expressed via those for a single qw according to eqs .  , .",
    "the period of the structure is determined by the extended bragg condition @xcite which , for @xmath135 , reduces with high accuracy to @xmath136 which formally coincides with the exact condition for structures with the matched dielectric constants .     and @xmath56 .",
    "the calculation is performed for @xmath137 @xmath96ev , @xmath138  , @xmath139 and @xmath57 .",
    "curves are calculated for six structures containing different number , @xmath6 , of wells indicated at each curve .",
    "the symbol @xmath46 corresponds to the structure with infinite @xmath6 . ]",
    "4 shows the @xmath6-dependence of reflection spectra from the resonant bragg structures with the different refractive indices @xmath140 and @xmath16 . the values of parameters are indicated in the figure caption .",
    "the calculation is performed with allowance for the nonradiative damping @xmath141 .",
    "one can see that there are not two but three special frequencies in the reflection spectra .",
    "arrows point at these frequencies labelled as @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath142 .",
    "an appearance of the special frequencies @xmath64 can be explained in terms of the linear - fractional transformation as well as for the structures without the dielectric contrast .",
    "since these frequencies are located near the forbidden - gap edges one can apply the approximation ( [ sinsin ] ) . for @xmath47 , similarly to , it is necessary to take into account a term quadratic in the difference @xmath118 . as in the above case @xmath143 , an absolute value of the reflection coefficient @xmath36 at the frequencies @xmath64 weakly depends on @xmath6 whereas the phase appreciably varies with @xmath6 .",
    "the dependence @xmath81 at a frequency @xmath21 lying close to the upper or lower edge of the polariton gap can approximately be described by @xmath144 valid for @xmath145 . in the particular case",
    "@xmath146 this equation transforms into eq .",
    "( [ phias ] ) .    unlike the frequencies @xmath64 , at the frequency @xmath142 both the absolute value and the phase of the reflection coefficient @xmath36 are practically independent of @xmath6 , i.e. , not only @xmath147 but also @xmath148 .",
    "this happens because the reflection of light at the frequency @xmath142 from a single qw sandwiched between the semi - infinite barriers is almost absent , namely , a sum of two terms @xmath149 and @xmath150 in is close to zero .",
    "in other words , the contributions to the reflectivity of a qw due to the presence of the dielectric contrast and the exciton resonance cancel each other @xcite .",
    "according to the absence of reflection from one qw brings with it the vanishing reflection coefficient from @xmath6 such wells , i.e. , @xmath151 . as a result ,",
    "the amplitude reflection coefficient from the whole structure @xmath152 equals @xmath153 and is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the frequency @xmath154 satisfies the inequalities @xmath155 .",
    "this allows one to neglect the damping rates @xmath156 and @xmath9 in the denominator of the expression for @xmath157 .",
    "furthermore , because of closeness of the refractive indices @xmath140 and @xmath16 the inequality @xmath158 holds . neglecting corrections of the order @xmath159 in equations for @xmath126 , @xmath127 and the difference of @xmath160 from @xmath8",
    "we obtain that the condition @xmath161 is satisfied at the frequency @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "obviously , the inequalities @xmath164 are realized for a small enough coefficient @xmath165 . in the limit",
    "@xmath166 when @xmath167 , a value of @xmath154 tends to infinity , i.e. , this special frequency is absent for structures with the matched dielectric constants . for parameters of the structure used while calculating the spectra in fig .  4 , the frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath142 accidentally turn out to be very close to each other .",
    "for the resonant bragg structures with the matched dielectric constants of the well and barrier materials , we have given an analytical explanation of an existence of the special frequencies @xmath64 in the optical reflection spectra at which the reflection coefficient @xmath86 is close to @xmath41 and almost independent of the number of qws in the structure .",
    "near these frequencies the amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath36 can be approximately written in the form of an @xmath6-dependent linear - fractional function which sends points on the real axis to points in the complex plane lying on a circle centered near the coordinate origin .",
    "this means that the reflection coefficient @xmath168 is indeed almost independent of @xmath6 although the phase of the reflected wave @xmath169 is quite well approximated by a linear function of @xmath6 .",
    "we have shown that , for nonzero exciton nonradiative damping @xmath9 , the reflection spectra are also characterized by special frequencies but their values at these frequencies become more sensitive to @xmath6 .    in optical reflection spectra from resonant bragg structures with the dielectric contrast",
    "there are not two but three special frequencies .",
    "the origin of two of them can be interpreted in terms of a linear - fractional transformation in the same way as in the case @xmath134 .",
    "the reflection coefficient from a single qw put between the semi - infinite barriers vanishes at the third frequency @xmath142 because the contributions to the reflectivity resulting from the dielectric contrast and the exciton resonance mutually compensate one another .",
    "the consequence is that , at the frequency @xmath142 , the amplitude reflection coefficient from a structure containing an arbitrary number of such wells equals @xmath153 as if the structure contained no qws at all .",
