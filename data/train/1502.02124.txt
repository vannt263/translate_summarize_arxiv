    "matrix model groundstate wavefunctions have been investigated by means of different approaches in the past . in the quest for a better understanding of m - theory , this has been carried out either from the point of view of supermembrane theory @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; or from the point of view of matrix models @xcite ; or from the point of view of yang - mills theories described in the slow mode regime @xcite .",
    "the existence of a groundstate has been tested indirectly by means of a unique normalizable zero - energy wavefunction invariant under @xmath2 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "direct attempts to characterize it include those reported in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "regimes near the origin were examined in @xcite and asymptotic regimes were considerd in @xcite for different supersymmetric matrix models .",
    "the interest in a better understanding of theses theories relies in part on the ads / cft conjecture @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 supersymmetric @xmath4 matrix model is dual to the decoupling limit of the d0-brane geometry in the type iia string theory @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this theory is continuous from zero to infinity as it was established in @xcite . in the bfss interpretation ,",
    "the nonzero energy eigenstates of the model correspond to scattering states that form a continuum . in the bulk picture",
    ", black holes can decay into radiating d0-branes that can escape to infinity @xcite .",
    "the d0-branes are long - life metastable states associated in the bulk description to the microstates of a black hole at finite temperatures",
    ".    a rigorous treatment of the existence and uniqueness of the groundstate of these matrix models would contribute towards a better understanding of the nature of these matrix model metastable states .",
    "several authors have attempted to characterize the asymptotic structure of the groundstate wave function @xcite .",
    "an asymptotic expansion for the groundstate wave function in the @xmath5 case has been studied in @xcite .",
    "subsequent proposals for @xmath6 were made in @xcite .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath7 a more recent analysis has been considered in @xcite .    in this note",
    "we examine the existence and uniqueness of a groundstate of a supersymmetric matrix model with @xmath8 symmetry on a compact space .",
    "the latter corresponds to a @xmath9 truncation of the supermembrane analyzed in @xcite .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , this model does not admit a normalizable state when the spacetime is noncompact .",
    "our interest for examining this model on a bounded domain is two - folded . on the one hand",
    ", it provides a suitable illustration of new techniques for determining the existence of massless groundstates for a class of supersymmetric bounded matrix models . on the other hand",
    ", it has an intrinsic interest as an example of octonionic supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "octonion quantum mechanics was introduced in the context of strong interactions and decay @xcite . a new quantum theory described in terms of nonassociative but commutative algebra",
    "was introduced as a basic tool in @xcite .",
    "yang mills theories valued on the octonionic algebra with gauge group g2 , the automorphisms of the octonions , was recently analysed in @xcite .    despite of the fact that the decay description in fermi theory and the yukawa model of nuclear force rendered this type of construction useless in its original context , these models have remained of substantial interest in the theory of matrix models .",
    "the automorphisms of the octonions is the group @xmath8 , which is well - known to contain the standard model .",
    "a supermembrane with octonionic twists and a gauge @xmath10 symmetry was considered in @xcite .",
    "the symmetry in the latter was obtained by performing a deformation of the original @xmath11 supermembrane matrix model described in a @xmath11 minkowski spacetime theory @xcite .",
    "this example of truncation of the supermembrane in the l.c.g . was originally formulated @xcite in a minkowski spacetime @xmath13 .",
    "although it is possible to obtain explicitly two solutions for the ground state problem , it was shown in @xcite that they fail to be square - integrable so the truncated model has no massless states . in the following",
    "we examine the groundstate wavefunction , but now for the restricted case when the spatial part of the target space is compact .",
    "the model may be formulated in terms of a pure imaginary octonion with coefficients valued on the @xmath14 algebra : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are real @xmath17 fields which only depend on the time coordinate , @xmath18 are the generators of the @xmath14 algebra , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the pure imaginary basis of the octonionic non - associative division algebra .",
    "the other object involved in the supersymmetric model is a pure imaginary octonion with coefficients valued on the @xmath14 algebra @xmath21 where @xmath22 are @xmath23 fields valued on an odd part of a grassmanian algebra .",
    "+ the quantum hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 the bosonic part of the hamiltonian is a schrdinger operator @xmath25    where @xmath26 @xmath27 are the structure constants of @xmath14 algebra @xmath28=f_{abe}\\delta^{ec}t_c.\\ ] ] the fermionic part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the structure constants @xmath31=c^{ijk}e^k$ ] of the octonionic algebra .",
    "the bosonic potential @xmath32 is a quartic polynomial in @xmath33 , while the fermionic hamiltonian is linear in the @xmath33 variable .",
    "these are the characteristic properties of the hamiltonian of the @xmath12 supermembrane .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under the group @xmath34 , the automorphisms of the octonions , and under @xmath4 associated to the regularized model .",
    "these are rigid symmetries .",
    "the hamiltonian is also invariant under @xmath35 supersymmetry with the generators : @xmath36 the corresponding anticommutation relations are : @xmath37",
    "let @xmath39 be a bounded domain with piecewise smooth boundary .",
    "the problem can be formulated as follows : find a wavefunction @xmath40 such that @xmath41 in @xmath39 , satisfying the boundary condition @xmath42 on @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath40 is a superfield , that is , it admits an expansion in terms of the grassmann elements as follows : @xmath44 this is a finite expansion , since @xmath19 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are odd elements of the grassman algebra .      since the hamiltonian @xmath38 is a schrdinger operator on a compact domain with a smooth potential , existence of the wavefunction @xmath40 follows from the lax - milgram theorem .",
    "uniqueness can be shown along the following lines . if @xmath47 and @xmath48 are two solutions , then @xmath49 in @xmath39 and @xmath50 on @xmath43 .",
    "we then show that @xmath41 in @xmath39 and @xmath51 on @xmath43 , imply @xmath51 in @xmath39 .",
    "hence @xmath52 in @xmath39 will follow immediately .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath39 is an hypercube with faces given by the hypersurface obtained by fixing a constant value for one of the coordinates , say @xmath53 .",
    "we remark that the following argument may also be implemented on any @xmath39 with smooth boundary .",
    "firstly observe that @xmath54 below we employ this property of the supersymmetric hamiltonian .",
    "assume @xmath55 in @xmath39 .",
    "then , when we approach to a point on the hypersurface @xmath53 , due to continuity and the boundary condition @xmath51 , we have @xmath56 at the surface @xmath53 , the partial derivatives with respect to the other coordinates vanish . hence @xmath57 for @xmath58",
    ". we are then left with @xmath59 since each term has a different number of @xmath46 factors , then each term must be zero .",
    "we then have from the first terms @xmath60 @xmath61 when @xmath62 there is no restriction on the corresponding wavefunction ( from the anticommuting properties of @xmath46 ) .",
    "for the generic term we obtain @xmath63 for the indices @xmath64 different from @xmath65 without loss of generality we can assume @xmath66 to be antisymmetric under the exchange of the @xmath67 indices .    now , assume that @xmath68 in @xmath39 .",
    "approach to a point on @xmath53 .",
    "we have @xmath69 hence the relevant restriction for @xmath47 is @xmath70 in explicit form we obtain @xmath71 from ( [ ii ] ) and ( [ iv ] ) , we get @xmath72 for all @xmath67 .",
    "consequently @xmath73 for all @xmath67 and @xmath74 at the hypersurface @xmath75 for the generic term in the expansion we get @xmath76 which together with ( [ iii ] ) yields @xmath77 on the hypersurface defined by @xmath53 for any set of indices .",
    "therefore , according to the arguments in the previous two paragraphs , the condition @xmath41 in @xmath43 , implies that @xmath78    now , the equation @xmath79 is an elliptic system of partial differential equations on the components of @xmath40 : @xmath80 .",
    "on @xmath43 we have @xmath81 @xmath82 the partial differential system has analytic coefficients .",
    "then , by virtue of the cauchy - kowalevski theorem , it follows that @xmath51 on @xmath39 .    a detailed argument along these lines can be rigorously established and will be reported in due course .",
