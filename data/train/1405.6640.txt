    "in the past eleven years a series of charmoniumlike states @xmath5 has been announced at various experimental facilities ( for recent reviews see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "these exotic mesons are a class of hadrons that decay to final states that contain a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark but can not be easily accommodated in the remaining unfilled states in the @xmath6 level scheme .",
    "one of the most interesting exotic states are the charged states , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that clearly have a more complex structure than @xmath6 pair , being natural candidates for molecular or tetraquarks states .",
    "so far , most of the available experimental and theoretical investigations of the charmoniumlike exotic candidates have been focused on the spectrum and decays or the production in @xmath7 collisions . in order to decipher the nature of these states , more accurate data and new processes involving these states",
    "would be equally important .",
    "the search of @xmath8 charmoniumlike states by other production processes will not only confirm these observed states , but also will be useful to study their underlying structures . in the last years , the study of the production of exotic hadrons in proton - proton @xcite , heavy ion @xcite and photon - hadron @xcite collisions was proposed by several authors . in particular , the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for the photoproduction of charged charmoniumlike states @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicate a large enhancement of the cross section near the threshold , which could be considered a signature for the existence of these states in @xmath9 collisions . unfortunately ,",
    "as the desy - hera @xmath10 collider stopped its operations in 2007 , the experimental analysis of these states in photon - hadron collisions was not possible and remains an open question .    in recent years we proposed the analysis of photon induced interactions in hadronic collisions as an alternative way to study the qcd dynamics at high energies",
    "the basic idea is that in this interactions the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons into the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section .",
    "the main advantages of using hadron - hadron collisions for studying photon induced interactions are the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities that can be achieved at existing accelerators ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we estimated the production of some exotic states in @xmath11 interactions considering @xmath0 collisions at lhc energies and demonstrated that the experimental analysis of these states is , in principle , feasible .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath12 collisions . in this paper",
    "we will demonstrate that the study of @xmath9 interactions at the rhic and lhc can also provide complementary and independent checks on the properties of the exotic states , and help to understand their underlying nature . in this paper , we obtain , for the first time , an estimate of the photoproduction of the charmoniumlike states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in proton - proton collisions at the rhic and lhc .",
    "as we will show in the following , the prospect to observe these states is rather promising and thus an experimental analysis is strongly motivated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of photon - hadron interactions in hadron - hadron collisions . in section [ photo_exotic ]",
    "we discuss the photoproduction of exotic charmoniumlike states and present the assumptions of the formalism used in our calculations . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we present our predictions for the rapidity distribution and total cross sections for the photoproduction of the exotic hadrons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath0 collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we present a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "lets consider a hadron - hadron interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath13 ) and at ultra relativistic energies . in this regime",
    "we expect the dominance of the electromagnetic interaction . in heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the heavy nuclei give rise to strong electromagnetic fields due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , which can interact with each other . in a similar way",
    ", it also occurs when considering ultra relativistic protons in @xmath14 colliders .",
    "the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron ( @xmath11 process ) or can interact directly with the other hadron ( @xmath15 process ) . for photon - hadron interactions",
    "the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - target production cross section @xcite . in the particular case of the photoproducion of a charmoniumlike state @xmath16 in a hadron - hadron collision ,",
    "the total cross section is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 represents a rapidity gap in the final state and @xmath20 or @xmath21 depending if the interaction is mediated by a neutral ( @xmath22 ) or a charged ( @xmath23 ) particle , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 is the rapidity distribution for the photon - target interaction induced by the hadron @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , which can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath22 is the photon energy , @xmath28 is the equivalent photon flux , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the c.m.s energy squared of the photon - hadron and hadron - hadron system , respectively . in what follows",
    "we assume that the photon spectrum of a relativistic proton is given by @xcite ,    @xmath31 .",

    "moreover , the detection of the neutron in the final state can be useful to separate the events associated to the production of a charged charmoniumlike state . finally , it is important to emphasize that as the photon spectrum decreases with energy approximately like @xmath35 , the main contribution for the total cross section , eq .",
