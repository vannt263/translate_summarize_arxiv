    "soon after the first experimental realization of an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , the understanding of the physical properties of the system has been tested by comparing experimental results for the frequencies of collective excitation modes @xcite with corresponding theoretical results @xcite . the same paradigm remains of great relevance for present and future studies that focus on a bec in optical lattices @xcite , in disordered potentials @xcite , for low - dimensional cold bosons @xcite or ultracold fermions @xcite .",
    "the essential merit of testing theoretical predictions using collective modes stems from the possibility to measure frequencies of collective modes with a high accuracy of the order of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for instance , a promising experimental proposal for observing a quantum anomaly based on a very precise measurement of the collective bec mode , has been recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "usually , collective modes are induced by a modulation of the external trapping potential @xcite . in the recent paper @xcite ,",
    "however , an alternative way of a condensate excitation has been experimentally realized .",
    "a broad feshbach resonance of @xmath0li @xcite allows to modulate the atomic _",
    "s_-wave scattering length by modulating an external magnetic field . based on this property ,",
    "a harmonic modulation of the _ s_-wave scattering length has been achieved @xmath2 with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bohr radius , yielding a time - dependent interaction among atoms . for the specific set of experimental parameters ,",
    "a quadrupole oscillation mode has been excited in this way and resonances located at the quadrupole frequency and its second harmonic have been observed .",
    "there are several advantages of such experimental scheme : for instance , in future experiments with multispecies bec , a single component could be individually excited in this way while the excitation of other components would occur only indirectly",
    ".    motivated by the latter experimental study , in this paper we analyze the condensate dynamics induced by the harmonic modulation of the _ s_-wave scattering length in more detail . on the mean - field level at zero temperature ,",
    "the bec dynamics is captured by the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the condensate wavefunction and the time - dependent interaction leads to a time - dependent nonlinearity . depending on the closeness of the external modulation frequency @xmath5 to one of condensate s eigenmodes ,",
    "a qualitatively different dynamical behavior emerges . in the non - resonant case",
    ", we have small - amplitude oscillations of the condensate size around the equilibrium widths , and we are in the regime of linear response .",
    "however , as @xmath5 approaches an eigenmode , we expect a resonant behavior which is characterized by large amplitude oscillations . in this case",
    "it is clear that a linear response analysis does not provide a qualitatively good description of the system dynamics .",
    "first theoretical studies of collective modes of bec @xcite have explored dynamical properties in the linear regime of small amplitude oscillations .",
    "certain nonlinear aspects of a condensate dynamics induced by a trap modulation are given in refs .",
    "@xcite , whereas two - component becs are dealt with in refs .",
    "we emphasize that very small oscillation amplitudes , which occur in the linear regime , are experimentally hard to observe . on the other hand ,",
    "very large amplitude oscillations lead to a fragmentation of the condensate @xcite .",
    "thus , the case in between is of main experimental interest and represents the main objective of our study .    to this end",
    ", we use an approach that is complementary to the recent theoretical considerations @xcite of a bec with harmonically modulated interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite the real - time dynamics of a spherically symmetric bec was numerically studied and analytically explained using the resonant bogoliubov - mitropolsky method @xcite . on the other hand , in our approach in order to discern induced dynamical features , we look directly at the excitation spectrum obtained as a fourier transform of the time - dependent condensate width . from this type of numerical analysis",
    "we find characteristic nonlinear properties : higher harmonic generation , nonlinear mode coupling , and significant shifts in the frequencies of collective modes with respect to linear response results .",
    "in addition , we work out an analytic perturbative theory with respect to the modulation amplitude capable of capturing many of the mentioned nonlinear effects obtained numerically .",
    "nonlinearity - induced frequency shifts were considered previously in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of bosonic collective modes excited by modulation of the trapping potential , and also in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a superfluid fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "our analytical approach is based on the poincar - lindstedt method @xcite , in the same spirit as presented in refs .",
    "however , the harmonic modulation of the interaction strength introduces additional features that require a separate treatment .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was predicted that a harmonic modulation of the scattering length leads to the creation of faraday patterns , i.e. density waves , in bec . up to now",
    ", faraday patterns have been experimentally induced by harmonic modulation of the transverse confinement strength @xcite , which is studied analytically and numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus only on the nonlinear properties of low - lying collective modes and do not consider possible excitations of faraday patterns .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "ii we provide the necessary theoretical background - the mean - field gp equation and the time - dependent variational approximation of its solution . in sec .",
    "iii we consider a spherically symmetric bec with harmonically modulated scattering length .",
    "we analyze the condensate dynamics in detail and identify characteristic nonlinear features . in sec .",
    "iv we focus on the experimentally most interesting axially symmetric bec . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize the main points of our study and discuss the relevance of our results for future experimental setups .",

    "we have a kinetic energy term , an external axially symmetric harmonic trap potential @xmath8 with the trap aspect ratio @xmath9 , and a nonlinear term arising from the mean - field interaction between the atoms .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath10 is proportional to the total number of atoms in the condensate @xmath11 and to the _ s_-wave scattering length @xmath12 .",
    "a specific feature of the recent experiment @xcite is the harmonic modulation of the _ s_-wave scattering length described by eq .",

    ", we use the gaussian approximation introduced in refs .  @xcite . to this end",
    "we assume that the condensate wave function with contact interaction has the same gaussian form as in the non - interacting case , just with renormalized parameters .",
    "thus , we use a time - dependent variational method based on a gaussian ansatz , which reads for an axially symmetric trap : @xmath14\\nonumber\\\\   & \\times&\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{z^2}{u_z(t)^2}+i z^2 \\phi _ z ( t)\\right ] , \\label{eq : gauss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a time - dependent normalization , while @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are variational parameters .",
    "they have straightforward interpretation : @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to the radial and to the axial condensate width , while @xmath22 an @xmath18 represent the corresponding phases .",
    "therefore , the above ansatz describes dynamics of the condensate in terms of the time - dependent condensate widths and phases , while no center of mass motion is considered here .",
    "this is due to the fact that modulation of the interaction strength does not induce this type of motion .    following the variational approach introduced earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , we insert ansatz ( [ eq : gauss ] ) to the action yielding the gp equation , and extremize it with respect to variational parameters . in this way",
    "we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations that govern the condensate dynamics .",
    "although here we consider a time - dependent interaction , this does not change the main steps in the derivation of variational equations . by extremizing the action ,",
    "we first obtain a coupled system of differential equations of the first order for all variational parameters .",
    "the equations for the phases @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be solved explicitly in terms of widths @xmath25 and @xmath26 , yielding @xmath27 after inserting the above expressions into equations for the widths , we finally obtain a system of two differential equations of second order for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which we will refer to as a gaussian approximation :    @xmath28    in the previous set of equations and in all equations that follow , we express all lengths in the units of the characteristic harmonic oscillator length @xmath29 and time in units of @xmath30 .",

    "therefore , it represents a solid analytical description of bec dynamics .",
    "however , due to the nonlinear form of the underlying gp equation , we expect nonlinearity - induced shifts in the frequencies of low - lying modes with respect to the values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linres ] ) calculated using the linear stability analysis .",
    "in particular , our goal is to describe collective modes induced by the harmonic modulation of the interaction strength in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modint ] ) . in the case of a close matching of the driving frequency @xmath5 and one of the bec eigenmodes we expect resonances , i.e. large amplitude oscillations .",
    "here , the role of the nonlinear terms becomes crucial and nonlinear phenomena become visible , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "using a simple symmetry - based reasoning , we conclude that a harmonic modulation of interaction strength in the case of a spherically symmetric bec , i.e. @xmath52 , leads to the excitation of the breathing mode only , so that @xmath53 . this fact simplifies numerical and analytical calculations and this is why we first consider this case before we embark to the study of a more complex axially symmetric bec .",
    "thus , the system of ordinary differential eqs .  ( [ eq : var1 ] ) and ( [ eq : var2 ] ) reduces to a single equation : @xmath54 the equilibrium condensate width @xmath55 satisfies @xmath56 and a linear stability analysis yields the breathing mode frequency @xmath57 note that the above result for the breathing mode can be also obtained from eq .",

    "in addition to the expected resonances close to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , a more thorough exploration of solutions of the variational equation ( [ eq : sphvar ] ) shows that other `` resonances '' are present such as , e.  g.   at @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
