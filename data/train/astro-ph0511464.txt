    "quasars are luminous ( l@xmath4  erg  sec@xmath1 ) and compact in the sense that the entire quasar luminosity originates within an unresolved core region ( e.g. radius smaller than @xmath5  pc ) .",
    "large scale powerful outflows in a form of winds and jets are also observed .",
    "such quasar activity is usually associated with an accretion process onto a supermassive black hole in the center of the a host galaxy ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "this accretion process is not fully understood , however it is clear that a large fuel supply is needed to power a quasar . where does the fuel come from and how",
    "quasars are born ?",
    "the two scenarios involve a rich environment of clusters of galaxies : ( 1 ) a merger event can initiate a rapid fuel supply and efficient accretion ; ( 2 ) large deposits of gas in the centers of cooling flow clusters can ignite the quasar ( fabian & nulsen 1977 ) .",
    "there is a growing evidence for the past quasar activity in many x - ray clusters observed recently with _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "for example x - ray morphology of m87 in the virgo cluster ( forman et al 2005 ) and perseus a ( fabian et al 2003 ) shows large scale jets , signature of shocks and `` bubbles '' filled with radio plasma .",
    "such x - ray morphology suggests a dissipation of energy into the cluster medium which prevents its cooling .",
    "detailed studies of several clusters show the intermittent activity of a supermassive black hole of the central galaxy , with an average total outburst power reaching @xmath6  ergs . however , in all these systems the supermassive black hole of the cd galaxy is in the quiescence with the nucleus luminosity l@xmath7  erg  sec@xmath1 . on the other hand one would expect that some powerful quasar should reside in clusters .",
    "thus where are the clusters associated with the quasars ?",
    "quasars are rare at low redshift , where most of x - ray clusters have been studied in details .",
    "the quasar density increases with redshift and in fact the quasars are seen in rich environment of clusters of galaxies in optical surveys ( ellingson , yee & green 1991 ) . over the last decade",
    "attempts have been made to find x - ray clusters associated with radio - loud quasars at high redshift .",
    "the limited capabilities of the available x - ray telescopes allowed only for a few detections of extended x - ray emission around radio sources at redshifts @xmath8 ( hardcastle & worrall 1999 , worrall et al .",
    "2001 , odea et al 2000 , crawford & fabian 2003 ) .",
    "high dynamic range observations are required to detect faint diffuse emission in the vicinity of a bright powerful source . now _",
    "chandra _ can resolve spatially distinct x - ray emission components in the vicinity of a strong x - ray source with @xmath91  arcsec resolution and a high dynamic range , as evidenced , for example , by the discovery of many resolved quasar x - ray jets ( e.g. schwartz et al .",

    "a large fraction of the radio source population is comprised of powerful compact sources ( 10 - 20@xmath10 , odea 1998 ) .",
    "their radio morphologies show a compact emission on arcsec ( vla resolution ) scales while on milliarcsec scales ( vlbi ) the sources look remarkably like scaled down large radio galaxies , where the entire radio structure ( 1 - 10  kpc ) is enclosed within the host galaxy . for more than a decade now there has been a clear controversy regarding their nature ( see odea 1998 and references therein ) . in the _ evolution _ model ( readhead et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) the source size and the characteristic spectral break at ghz radio frequencies could be an indication of young age , while in the other model the radio jet could be _ frustrated _ ( wilkinson et al .",
    "1981 , van breugel et al .",
    "1984 ) by a confining medium .",
    "although recent studies give more weight to the _ evolution _ model there has been no definite observational evidence to rule out either of the models and both interpretations are still viable .",
    "because these sources are very powerful one would expect that they reside in rich cluster environments . in either scenario the amount of fuel required to power a source is high , while in addition in the frustrated scenario the cluster medium should be dense enough to confine a radio source .",
    "thus these compact radio may reside in clusters and therefore might be suitable candidates for detecting an x - ray cluster emission .",

    "the quasar optical - uv ( big blue bump ) luminosity of 5.7@xmath51erg  sec@xmath1 ( simpson & rawlings , 2000 ) is related to the accretion onto a supermassive black hole , so we can estimate the central black hole mass and required accretion rate .",
