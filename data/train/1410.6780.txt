    "polymers exposed to an unfavorable environment can collapse or change shape in order to minimize surface energy @xcite .",
    "examples of unfavorable environments include a poor solvent or a hydrophilic - hydrophobic interface like the one between water and either air or oil .",
    "examples of conformations driven by such energy minimization are rings , loops , coils , spools , tori / toroids , hairpins or tennis rackets @xcite . in filaments comprising aggregated proteins or peptides",
    ", ring formation falls into two main classes : fully annealed rings occasionally observed as intermediate states during protein fibrillation , like in apolipoprotein c - ii @xcite and a@xmath1 @xcite ; or ring formation in actively driven systems , where the energy required for filament bending is provided by gtp or atp @xcite .",
    "insulin has been shown to form open - ring shaped fibrils when pressure was applied during fibrillation @xcite , which was explained by an anisotropic distribution of void volumes in fibrils and therefore aggregation into bent fibrils .",
    "we study amyloid fibrils , which are linear supramolecular assemblies of proteins / peptides that , despite a large diversity in possible peptide sequences , show remarkable structural homogeneity .",
    "peptides form @xmath0-sheets that stack , often with chiral registry , to form a filament whose main axis is perpendicular to the @xmath0-strands @xcite .",
    "fully formed fibrils can consist of one or , more commonly , multiple filaments , assembled into twisted ribbons with a twist pitch determined by the number of filaments in the fibrils @xcite .",
    "their high aspect ratio ( diameter usually less than @xmath2  nm , total contour length up to several @xmath3 m ) leads to liquid crystalline phases in both three ( 3d ) @xcite and two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite .",
    "amyloid fibrils were initially studied due to their involvement in many different degenerative diseases such as diabetes ii or parkinson s disease @xcite . however , protein fibrils have recently experienced a surge of interest in potential applications in materials @xcite , and functional roles have been identified in biological processes such as hormone storage @xcite , emphasizing the importance of understanding their structure and properties in 2d .    here , we present experimental evidence for the development of _ curved _ fibrils at interfaces .",
    "semiflexible @xmath0-lactoglobulin fibrils are found to undergo a shape change and passively form open rings upon adsorption to an interface ( liquid - liquid or liquid - air ) .",
    "we show that this can not be described by a simple bending modulus ; this bending can instead be understood in terms of a _ spontaneous curvature _ induced on symmetry grounds by the chiral and polar nature of the fibril , when interacting with the heterogeneous environment provided by an interface .",
    "a comparison of different fibril batches of the same protein shows that the probability of forming rings depends on the average fibril thickness , with batches of thicker fibrils not forming loops .",
    "these results imply that flexible non - symmetric bodies embedded in heterogeneous media  such as the physiological environment  can be expected to deform , bend , and twist , depending on the specific surface interaction with the environment .",
    "for example , concentration gradients of ions or ph could enhance shape changes necessary for locomotion in flexible nanoswimmers @xcite , or be used to promote or control self - assembly through shape changes .",
    "one could even envision high surface to volume materials such as bicontinuous phases with large length scales being used to process large amounts of flexible shape changers .",
    "when imaging the air - water interfacial fibril layer by afm using a modified langmuir - schaefer horizontal transfer technique ( see materials and methods ) to resolve 2d liquid crystallinity , we found that , in addition to nematic and isotropic fibril domains @xcite , some @xmath0-lactoglobulin fibrils were present in circular conformations .",
    "these rings appear at the lowest interfacial density investigated , where fibril alignment is still negligible @xcite , and persist in the presence of nematic fibril domains up to high densities [ see supplementary note 1 , supplementary fig . s1 and s2 ] .",
    "ring diameters range from @xmath4  @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : afm ] and [ fig : ptsem ] ) , and are consistent whether observed _ via afm _ at the air - water interface , cryogenic scanning electron microscopy ( cryo - sem ) or passive probe particle tracking at the oil - water interface , confirming that fibrils have a similar tendency to bend at air - liquid and liquid - liquid interfaces . a small selection of the vast variety of ring morphologies is presented in fig .  [ fig : afm ] .",
    "highly complex structures involving several fibrils are quite common ( fig .",
    "[ fig : afm]a , b , s1 and s2 ) , whereas relatively few distinct rings or tennis rackets comprise a single fibril and can rather be thought to be intermediate assembly states @xmath6 to final ring structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : afm]c and d ) @xcite .",
    "short fibrils , which could be the result of fracture due to the bending strain , exposure to air or inhomogeneous strong surface tension , also assemble into rings ( fig .",
    "s3 ) . alternatively",
    ", short fibrils frequently accumulate within an outer ring and align either along the circumference of this ring or parallel to each other in the center , with minimal contact with the ring itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig : afm]b and e ) .",
    "the long - lived presence , and hence inferred stability , of these self - organized conformations was confirmed by passive probe particle tracking experiments performed at the oil - water interface , where fluorescently - labelled spherical tracer particles ( diameter @xmath7  nm ) were observed to move in near - perfect circles or sickle - shaped trajectories over the course of three to four minutes . a simple pathway for ring formation could be the presence of nano- or microbubbles at the liquid surface , which give fibrils the opportunity to bend around their circumference @xcite .",
    "this would , however , also lead to a distortion of the peptide layer ( see materials and methods ) at the interface ; once the sample has dried , the bubble would have disappeared but still be visible in afm images as a height discontinuity through the ` bubble ' .",
    "the absence of such observations in afm ( fig .",
    "s4 ) , or of bubbles ( cavities ) in the cryo - sem images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ptsem ] ) , indicates that there is an inherent predisposition of the fibrils to bend , which then leads to circle formation upon interaction with a liquid surface .",
    "understanding these data requires a study of how surface effects influence the shape of fibrils ( or indeed filaments ) .",
    "we consider an inextensible fibril of length @xmath8 , represented as a twisted ribbon with chiral wavelength @xmath9 and pitch angle @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the inscribing radius of the twisted ribbon ( see supplementary note 2 ) .",
    "we parametrize the shape by @xmath12 , the direction parallel to the central axis of the ribbon , or equivalently the tangent vector of the fibril .",
    "the ribbon twists around its axis @xmath12 by the angle @xmath13 .",
    "we will parametrize the bending in terms of the angular rate of deflection @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the local curvature .",
    "hence , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the axis about which the tangent vector is deflected during a bend . for a fibril confined to bend on a surface , we take @xmath17 to be outward surface normal vector ( pointing _ into _ the liquid ) , so that @xmath18 can be either positive or negative .",
    "the free energy is given by @xcite @xmath19 the first term penalizes bending , and @xmath20 is the bending modulus .",
    "the second term penalizes twist relative to the native helical twist , which is parametrized by the chiral wavenumber @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 is the twist modulus .",
    "the vector @xmath23 represents the twist - bend couplings allowed by a polar fibril with a non - symmetric local cross section @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on the bend degrees of freedom , since in filaments with free ends , such as those considered here , the twist degrees of freedom will relax to accomodate any imposed bend .    a polar twisted fibril has an anisotropy that distinguishes ` head ' from ` tail ' directions along the fibril axis ; in f - actin this ` polarization ' arises from the orientations required of g - actin monomers to effect self - assembly @xcite ; in an @xmath24-helix the n - c polymerisation breaks the polar symmetry and in cross-@xmath0 amyloid fibrils such as those studied here the polarity is due to the molecular packing of @xmath0-sheets @xcite .",
    "the polarity is reflected in variations in molecular structure along the exposed surface of the twisted ribbon . when this structure is placed in a heterogenous environment , as occurs near a solid surface or when immersed within a meniscus between two fluids ( or fluid and gas )",
    ", the inhomogeneity of the environment generally leads to unbalanced torques on the body ( see supplementary note 2 , fig .",
    "s5 and s6 for details ) , even when local forces have balanced to place the fibril at the interface . a non - symmetric body , such as a chiral and polar fibril",
    ", can thus experience an effective spontaneous curvature @xcite .    to demonstrate this effect",
    ", we consider a fibril adsorbed _ onto _ a planar surface with which it interacts , rather than immersed _ within _ a meniscus .",
    "the effects are qualitatively the same , but the details are easier to understand in the adsorbed case .",
    "the surface and the adsorbed ribbon interact _ via _ numerous molecular interactions @xcite .",
    "although in principle _ all _ atoms in the fibril interact with every point on the surface due to coulomb interactions , screening limits the interaction to only the adsorbing surface .",
    "long - range dispersion interactions are also irrelevant for fibrils that are induced to bend or twist within the plane , since the change in this energy will be negligible .",
    "hence , we consider the following surface free energy @xmath25d^2r , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the twist pitch or wavelength , the average surface energy @xmath26 controls adsorption , and @xmath27 is the contact area of a the ribbon , which occurs every half wavelength .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath28 reflects the polar nature of the interaction and can vary from repulsive to attractive along the repeat patch .",
    "a polar moment ( with dimensions of energy ) of the interaction can be defined by @xmath29 where @xmath27 is the area of the patch where the fibril contacts the surface .",
    "the polar moment @xmath30 is determined by the nature of the interaction with the surface , and is thus not an intrinsic property of the fibril alone .",
    "[ fig : surfacecartoon ] shows an example in which the surface patch is a parallelogram with length @xmath31 and width @xmath32 . for a simple surface potential @xmath33 , where the coordinate @xmath34 is parallel to the fibril axis coordinate @xmath35 , the polar moment ( see supplementary note 2 ) has magnitude @xmath36 . here , @xmath37 is a geometric prefactor whose sign depends on the polarization and chirality , and parametrizes the degree to which the symmetric parellelogram is deformed into a non - symmetric shape to favor one sign of surface ` charge ' .        when the twisted ribbon is bent the ribbon - surface contact area changes shape , so that either the repulsive or attractive part of the polar interaction has more contact with the surface , depending on the sign of the bend ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surfacecartoon]c ) .",
    "this leads to a spontaneous curvature .",
    "the contribution of bending to the overall interaction energy can then be written as a chiral coupling between the bending rate @xmath38 and the polar moment @xmath30 : @xmath39 the vector product is the simplest term which has no mirror symmetry , and is thus appropriate for a chiral filament . moreover , under @xmath40 both @xmath18 and @xmath41 change sign , whereas @xmath30 does not , so that the free energy is also reparametrization - invariant .",
    "the dimensionless geometric factor @xmath42 and the moment @xmath30 depend on the details of the surface free energy @xmath43 interaction potential @xmath44 , the contact area shape , and its deformation under bending .",
    "the polar moment @xmath30 depends on the surface normal vector through its vector nature and the details of the surface - fibril interaction .",
    "the ellipses indicate other terms induced by the surface , such as contributions to the bend - twist or curvature moduli , or a spontaneous twist .",
    "we choose the convention that the surface normal vector @xmath17 points _ away _ from the surface and thus into the fibril .",
    "an example free energy @xmath45 is calculated in the supplementary information for a simple model contact potential .    the curvature in eq .",
    "[ eq : surf2 ] carries a sign : for @xmath46 the fibril bends in a right - handed sense around the surface normal vector @xmath17 , while for @xmath47 the fibril bends in a left - handed sense .",
    "the process of transferring the surface layer for afm observation orients the surface normal towards the afm observer , so that observation is from the liquid side towards the air side ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surfacecartoon ] ) . consider a polarization such that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , and choose @xmath50 ( as observed in the afm image ; see fig .",

    "[ fig : surfacecartoon ] , in which @xmath53 , where @xmath47 . in supplementary",
    "note 2 we find @xmath54 , so that this bend ( @xmath47 ) increases the energy , and thus @xmath46 is favored .",
    "similarly , for the opposite sign of @xmath55 a negative curvature @xmath47 is favored .    the competition between the surface energy ( eq .",
    "[ eq : surf2 ] ) and the ordinary fibril bending energy ( eq .  [ fullbulk ] ) leads , by minimization , to a spontaneous curvature @xmath56 given by ( see si ) @xmath57 this is equal to @xmath58 for the simple surface potential @xmath33 .",
    "isambert and maggs @xcite articulated how a surface can induce spontaneous curvature in a polar and chiral filament .",
    "they proposed a phenomenological free energy with an explicit spontaneous curvature that depends on the twist angle , and a surface interaction that breaks polar symmetry .",
    "hence , they have actually introduced a spontaneous curvature ` by hand ' .",
    "conversely , we present a model in which a polar surface interaction is itself chiral by virtue of the local chirality of the filament , and this gives rise to an effective spontaneous curvature as a result of total energy minimization .",
    "therefore , the functional form of the resulting spontaneous curvature differs from that proposed in ref .  [ 30 ] .",
    "enhanced curvature is expected for amyloid fibrils with fewer filaments ( as confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness ] ) , which will have smaller bending moduli @xmath20 , or for fibrils with larger polar moments @xmath59 and thus stronger surface interactions .",
    "in addition , the specific details of the surface deformation encapsulated in the function @xmath37 play an important role : fibrils for which the deformation leads to a more symmetric contact area will have a stronger geometric factor and thus a greater expected spontaneous curvature .      consider a segment of arc length @xmath60 of a wormlike chain ( wlc ) .",
    "the probability @xmath61 of finding this segment curved with curvature @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the radius of curvature , is governed by the bending modulus and should be gaussianly distributed , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the persistence length .",
    "deviations from the wlc model can be quite common , as with toroidal dna @xcite , in which the nucleic acids have a smaller persistence length at short length scales @xcite .",
    "the presence of rings in our system suggests a characteristic intrinsic curvature or length scale , in addition to the usual @xmath66 . for quantitative analysis",
    ", we have extracted the @xmath67 coordinates of fibrils from images acquired at low interfacial fibril densities after short adsorption times , where interactions and contact between fibrils are still minimal , and calculated @xmath68 ( fig .  [ fig : curvature ] ; see materials and methods ) .",
    "any rings present on the image were excluded from the analysis , since their closed topology would introduce an additional constraint . to benchmark this approach ,",
    "we first generate conformations based on the discrete wlc model with the @xmath66 obtained from the 2d mean squared end - to - end distance of fibrils at the air - water interface @xcite .",
    "these conformations are used to create artificial images of wlc polymers with the same resolution as the afm images and then subjected to the same tracking algorithm used for analyzing the real fibril image .",

    "the curvature distribution of simulated wlcs generated using all relevant parameters from the corresponding afm image ( see methods ) is shown as purple crosses and is successfully fitted with a gaussian probability distribution function ( purple line ) .",
    "tracking these wlcs results in a change in the probability densities ( blue crosses ) but the values are still gaussianly distributed ( blue line ) . plotting the normalized probabilities in logarithmic scale as a function of @xmath78 clearly shows fat tails and thus the presence of spontaneous curvature only in real fibrils ( insets in the lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "it has been argued that differences in @xmath56 are to be expected depending on the strength of adsorption to the surface @xcite and on whether the polymer is in 3d or 2d @xcite . to test this",
    ", we compare the curvature distributions from fibrils adsorbed to the air - water interface and transferred horizontally to mica ( fig .",
    "[ fig : curvature]a ) to fibrils deposited onto mica from a drop of the bulk solution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : curvature]b ) .",
    "the modified langmuir - schaefer afm sample preparation is a 2d to 2d transfer from a liquid onto a solid surface , which is much faster ( milliseconds ) than the slower ( seconds ) 3d to 2d equilibration obtained by depositing onto a solid substrate from bulk @xcite .",
    "the bending probability of fibrils adsorbed from the bulk to mica , where no rings are observed , was also found to deviate from a typical gaussian distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : curvature]b ) .",
    "fibrils hence bend as a result of their exposure to the inhomogeneous environment of solid - liquid , liquid - liquid , and gas - liquid interfaces , independently of how they initially adsorbed at these phase boundaries .",
    "as noted above , we predict a larger fibrillar diameter to imply a larger bending modulus , and hence a smaller likelihood of bending spontaneously ( according to eq.[eq : c0 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : thickness ] shows ratios of double- to triple - stranded fibrils for @xmath0-lactoglobulin fibrils produced from native protein obtained from three different suppliers .",
    "non - identical distributions can be expected due to different fibril processing conditions ( sample volumes , shearing and stirring histories ) between batches , and/or genetic variants between suppliers @xcite .",
    "this then affects the individual filament thickness , and number of filaments per fibril , due to subtle differences in proteolysis .",
    "thicker filaments , with larger bending moduli , should have much smaller spontaneous curvatures , and not be visibly curved if thick enough . fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness ] shows the distribution of number of strands per fibril , which is proportional to thickness , as determined from the afm images . the batch with the highest number of rings ( fig .  [ fig : afm ] )",

    "by contrast , for batches of fibrils formed with the same protocol but from protein obtained from a different supplier , primarily three - stranded fibrils were found , which did not assemble into rings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness]d ) . both a second batch of fibrils from the first source as well as a batch from a third supplier containing a more even mix of double- and triple - stranded fibrils yielded curved conformations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness]b and c ) . by separating the data used to calculate the normalized distribution of @xmath68 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvature]a into double- and triple - stranded fibrils ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness]e ) , we confirm that the normalized @xmath68 distribution of thick fibrils has a less pronounced fat tail and these fibrils thus bend less than their thinner counterparts . a similar trend is observed for the different batches in fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness]a - d , where a higher fraction of thicker fibrils in the sample results in less curved structures at the air - water interface and less spontaneous curvature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness]f ) .",
    "we provide evidence from three different and independent experimental techniques for the presence of complex self - assembled amyloid fibril structures at air - water and oil - water interfaces .",
    "it has previously been reported that fibril ends are particularly reactive , as shown in the disruption of liposomes occurring preferentially at fibril ends @xcite .",
    "their enhanced fibrillation properties as compared to the rest of the fibrils @xcite in addition to possible capillary interactions @xcite may play a role in the observed tendency of fibrils to form almost - closed rings .",
    "the genesis of these rings and loops is explained by a spontaneous curvature arising from the interaction of polar , chiral and semiflexible fibrils with an interface .",
    "because a spontaneous curvature but no ring formation was determined in fibrils at the solid mica - liquid interface , it can be concluded that a certain degree of mobility at the interface supports the assembly of fibrils into such geometries .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that amyloid fibrils adsorbed onto a mica surface from bulk can asymptotically reach the expected @xmath79 exponent for a self - avoiding random walk in 2d @xcite .",
    "the ability of fibrils to form rings correlates with the average fibril height distribution , with loops only observed in systems where single- and double - stranded fibrils dominate .",
    "a shift in fibril height towards more triple - stranded populations reduces the number of high curvature counts and thus the amount of ring structures present .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that a spontaneous curvature is expected also for thicker fibrils but at lower @xmath18 because of their higher bending modulus , meaning that only thick fibrils which are long enough ( @xmath80 ) will be able to form full rings .",
    "these findings have consequences for the understanding of how fibrils deposit @xmath81  @xmath82 , the morphology of plaques , biomechanical interactions of chiral filaments with surrounding tissues , and ultimately their effect on cells and organisms . a larger natural dynamic analogue in the form of the circular motion of polarly",

    "when the strip is bent downwards the top of the interaction strip is under tension whereas the bottom of the strip is under compression .",

    "the total bending free energy is given by the sum of the standard bending energy and the coupling to the surface : @xmath185 \\\\ & = \\int ds \\left [ \\frac12 b \\kappa^2 - \\frac{\\varepsilon \\omega^3 \\ell}{6\\lambda\\sin^2\\theta_p }   ( \\cos\\phi\\,{\\cot\\theta_p}+\\sin\\phi)\\kappa \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ( signed ) curvature is defined by @xmath186 .",
    "the bending modulus generally includes contributions from the surface , which can be calculated based on the formalism here .",

    "an exception occurs for highly charged filaments . in such cases",
    "the reduction in the dielectric constant and lack of screening near a hydrophobic surface will increase the electrostatic contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "the sign of the induced curvature can be understood as follows .",
    "consider @xmath189 , a helix with an opening angle of @xmath190 , and a polarization direction specified by @xmath191 ( roughly as in figs .",

    "there is a higher energy for exposing the upper right part of the parallelogram in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] to the surface .",
    "hence the preferred bending direction should be ` up ' in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( rather than the downward shown ) , to allow the relatively less of the costly part of the surface interaction to attain more contact with the surface .",
