    "the notion of equilibrium crystal shape is arguably the platonic ideal of crystal growth .",
    "it underpins much of our thinking about crystals and , accordingly , has been the subject of several special reviews and tutorials [ rottman and wortis 1984a , wortis 1988 , zia 1988 , williams and bartelt 1989 , bonzel 2003 ] and is a prominent section of most volumes and extended review articles and texts about crystals and their growth [ landau and lifshitz 1980 , van beijeren and nolden 1987 , nozires 1992 , pimpinelli and villain 1998 , sekerka 2004 ] . in actual situations",
    ", there are many complications that thwart observation of such behavior , including kinetic barriers , impurities , and other bulk defects like dislocations .",
    "furthermore , the notion of a well - defined equilibrium shape requires that the crystal not make contact with a wall or surface , since that would alter its shape . by the same token , the crystal",
    "can not then be supported , so gravity is neglected . for discussions of the effect of gravity or contact with walls , see , e.g. , nozires [ 1992 ] .",
    "gibbs [ 1874 - 8 ] is generally credited with being the first to recognize that the equilibrium shape of a substance is that which , for a fixed volume , minimizes the ( orientation - dependent ) surface free energy integrated over the entire surface : the bulk free energy is irrelevant since the volume is conserved , while edge or corner energies are ignored as being higher - order effects that play no role in the thermodynamic limit . herring [ 1951 , 1953 ] surveys the early history in detail : the formulation of the problem was also carried out independently by curie [ 1885 ] .",
    "the solution of this ecs problem , the celebrated wulff construction , was stated by by wulff ( 1901 ) , but his proof was incorrect .",
    "correct proofs were subsequently given by hilton [ 1903 ] , by liebmann [ 1914 ] , and by von laue [ 1943 ] , who presented a critical review .",
    "however , these proofs , while convincing of the theorem , were not general ( and evidently applied only to @xmath0=0 , since they assumed the ecs to be a polyhedron and compared the sum over the facets of the surface free energy of each facet times its area with a similar sum over a similar polyhedron with the same facet planes but slightly different areas ( and the same volume )",
    ". dinghas [ 1944 ] showed that the brunn - minkowski inequality could be used to prove directly that any shape differing from that resulting from the wulff construction has a higher surface free energy .",
    "although dinghas again considered only a special class of polyhedral shapes , herring [ 1951 , 1953 ] completed the proof by noting that dinghas s method is easily extended to arbitrary shapes , since the inequality is true for convex bodies in general . in their seminal paper on crystal growth , burton , cabrera , and frank [ 1951 ]",
    "present a novel proof of the theorem in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "since equilibrium implies minimum helmholtz free energy for a given volume and number , and since the bulk free energy is ipso facto independent of shape , the goal is to determine the shape that minimizes the integrated surface free energy of the crystal .",
    "the prescription takes the following form : one begins by creating a polar plot of the surface free energy as a function of orientation angle ( of the surface normal ) and draws a perpendicular plane ( or line in 2d ) through the tip of each ray .",
    "( there are many fine reviews of this subject by chernov [ 1960 ] , frank [ 1962 ] , mullins [ 1962 ] , and jackson [ 1975 ] . ) since the surface free energy in 3d ( three dimensions ) is frequently denoted by @xmath1 , this is often called a @xmath1 plot .",
    "the shape is then the formed by the interior envelope of these planes or lines , often referred to as a pedal . at zero temperature ,",
    "when the free energy is just the energy , this shape is a polyhedron in 3d and a polygon in 2d , each reflecting the symmetry of the underlying lattice . at finite temperature",
    "the shapes become more complex . in 2d",
    "the sharp corners are rounded . in 3d ,",
    "the behavior is richer , with two possible modes of evolution with rising temperature . for what wortis terms type - a crystals , all sharp boundaries smoothen together , while in type - b , first the corners smooth , then above a temperature denoted @xmath2 the edges also smooth .",
    "the smooth regions correspond to thermodynamic rough phases , with height - height correlation functions that diverge for large lateral separation @xmath3like @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ( typically @xmath6 ) called the roughening exponent  in contrast to facets , where they attain some finite value as @xmath7 [ pimpinelli and villain 1998 ] .",
    "the faceted regions in turn correspond to  frozen \" regions . pursuing the correspondence",
    ", sharp and smooth edges correspond to first - order and second - order phase transitions , respectively .",
    "the aim of this chapter is primarily to explore physical ideas regarding ecs and the underlying wulff constructions .",
    "this topic has also attracted considerable interest in the mathematics community .",

    "unfortunately , this polar angle is denoted by @xmath12 in much of the literature on vicinal surfaces , with @xmath11 used for in - plane misorientation ; most reviews of ecs use @xmath11 for the polar angle , as we shall here .",
    "the term  vicinal \" implies that the surface is in the vicinity of the orientation .",
    "it is generally assumed that the surface orientation itself is rough ( while the facet direction is below its roughening temperature and so is smooth ) .",
    "we consider the projected surface free energy @xmath30 [ jayaprakash et al .",
    "1984 ] ( with the projection being onto the low - index reference , facet direction of terraces ) :    @xmath31    the first term is the surface free energy per area of the terrace ( facet ) orientation ; it is often denoted @xmath32 .",
    "the average density of steps ( the inverse of their mean separation @xmath33 ) is @xmath34 , where @xmath18 is the step height . in the second term @xmath35 is the line tension or free energy per length of step formation .",
    "( since 2d is a dimension smaller than 3d , one uses @xmath36 rather than @xmath1 . skirting over the difference in units resulting from the dimensional difference , many use @xmath1 in both cases .",
    "while step free energy per length and line tension are equivalent for these systems , where the surface is at constant ( zero ) charge , they are inequivalent in electrochemical systems , where it is the electrode potential conjugate to the surface charge that is held fixed [ ibach and schmickler , 2003 ] ) the third term is associated with interactions between steps , in this case assumed to be proportional to @xmath37 ( so that this term , which also includes the @xmath38 density of steps , goes like @xmath39 ) . the final term is the leading correction .",
    "the @xmath37 interaction is due to a combination ( not a simple sum ) of two repulsive potential energies : the entropic repulsion due to the forbidden crossing of steps and the elastic repulsions due to dipolar strains near each step .",
    "an explicit form for @xmath40 is given in eq .",
    "( [ e : ga ] ) below .",
    "the @xmath37 of the entropic interaction can be understood from viewing the step as performing a random walk in the direction between steps ( the @xmath41 direction in  maryland notation \" for the proceedings  and then used by several other speakers . ] as a function of the @xmath28 direction ( which is time - like in the fermion transcription to be discussed later)cf .",

    "so the distance ( @xmath28 ) it must go till it touches a neighboring step satisfies @xmath42 . to get a crude understanding of the origin of the elastic repulsion , one can imagine that since a step is unstable relative to a flat surface , it will try to relax toward a flatter shape , pushing atoms away from the location of the step by a distance decaying with distance from the step .",
    "when two steps are close to each other , such relaxation will be frustrated since atoms on the terrace this pair of steps are pushed in opposite directions , so relax less than if the steps are widely separated , leading to a repulsive interaction .",

    "( [ e : fp - th ] ) reflects that there is no @xmath38 interaction between steps .",
    "in fact , there are some rare geometries , notably vicinals to ( 110 ) surfaces of fcc crystals ( au in particular ) that exhibit what amounts to @xmath38 repulsions that lead to more subtle behavior [ carlon and van beijeren 2000 ]",
    ". details about this faxcinating idiosyncratic surface are beyond the scope of this chapter ; readers should see the thorough , readable discussion by van albada et al .  [",
    "2002 ] .    as temperature increases",

    "eventually @xmath35 vanishes at a temperature @xmath43 associated with the roughening transition . at and above this @xmath43 of the facet orientation , there is a profusion of steps , and the idea of a vicinal surface becomes meaningless . for rough surfaces the projected surface free energy @xmath30 is quadratic in @xmath44 . to avoid the singularity at @xmath45 in the free energy expansion that thwarts attempts to proceed analytically , some treatments , notably bonzel and preuss [ 1995 ] , approximate @xmath30 as quadratic in a small region near @xmath45 .",
    "it is important to recognize that the vicinal orientation is thermodynamically rough , even though the underlying facet orientation is smooth .",
    "the two regions correspond to incommensurate and commensurate phases , respectively .",
    "thus , in a rough region the mean spacing @xmath46 between steps is not in general simply related to ( i.e. an integer multiple plus some simple fraction ) the atomic spacing .",
    "details of the roughening process have been reviewed by weeks [ 1980 ] and van beijeren and nolden [ 1987 ] ; the chapter by akutsu in this handbook provides an up - to - date account .",
    "however , for use later , we note that much of our understanding of this process is rooted in the mapping between the restricted bcsos ( body - centered [ cubic ] solid - on - solid ) model and the exactly - solvable [ lieb 1967 , lieb and wu 1972 ] symmetric 6-vertex model [ van beijeren 1977 ] , which has a transition in the same universality class as roughening .",
    "( this bcsos model is based on the bcc crystal structure , involving square net layers with abab stacking , so that sites in each layer are lateral displaced to lie over the centers of squares in the preceding [ or following ] layer .",
    "being an sos model means that for each column of sites along the vertical direction there is a unique upper occupied site , with no vacancies below it nor floating atoms above it .",
    "viewed from above , the surface is a square network with one pair of diagonally opposed corners on a layers and the other pair on b layers .",
    "the restriction is that neighboring sites must be on adjacent layers ( so that their separation is the distance from a corner to the center of the bcc lattice ) .",
    "there are then 6 possible configurations : two in which the two b corners are both either above or below the a corners and four in which one pair of catercorners are on the same layer and the other pair are on different layers ( one above and one below the first pair ) . in the symmetric model ,",
    "there are three energies , @xmath47 for the first pair , and @xmath48 for the others , the sign depending on whether the catercorner pair on the same lattice are on a or b [ nolden and van beijeren 1994 ] .",
    "the case @xmath49=0 corresponds to the @xmath50-model , which has an infinite - order phase transition and an essential singularity at the critical point , in the class of the kosterlitz - thouless [ 1973 ] transition [ kosterlitz 1974 ] .",

    "1993 ] of atoms on metal surfaces . however , there is a less well known metallic surface state on cu ( 001 ) , discovered relatively late ( compared to other surface states ) by kevan [ 1983 ] , centered at the zone - edge center @xmath434 rather than @xmath433 , that may provide a better explanation of frohn et al.s results in the redfield - zangwill framework . for surface - state mediated interactions between steps ,",
    "their formula indicates @xmath430 = 3/2 , comparable to the entropic and elastic repulsions .",
    "the effect of surface - state mediated interactions on twds was elucidated by pai et al .  [",
    "1994 ] in combined experimental and theoretical examination of vicinal ag(110 ) , which has a metallic surface state centered at @xmath435 , the middle of the shorter edge of the rectangular surface brillouin zone [ liu et al .  1984 ] .",
    "in essence , the surface state introduces a second length scale , the fermi wavelength @xmath436 , in addition to @xmath46 , with the major consequence that the twd is no longer a function of the single scaled dimensionless variable @xmath185 but depends also on @xmath46 . with a suitable model potential pai et al .  [ 1994 ] could then account for the different twds at a few different misorientations ( i.e. , mean step spacings ) . indeed , to establish convincingly that this friedel - like effect is significant",
    ", one must measure several different values of @xmath46 . while this paper has been cited with regards to other modifications of twds ( cf .",
    "e.g. , mugarza et al .  [ 2006 ] and li et al .  [ 2010 ] ) , i have found no other investigations of friedel - like effects on twds for several misorientations of the same substance .",
    "patrone and einstein [ 2012 ] discuss other issues related to possible anisotropic surface state dispersion as well as showing the insensitivity to the point in the surface brillouin zone about which the state is centered .",
    "an aspect of ecs studies on which there has been substantial progress since the 1980 s , but which has received little attention in this chapter , is comparing and reconciling the values of the characteristic energies ( surface free energy per area , step free energy per length , and step - step repulsion strength ) that are extracted from experimental measurements with ever - improving calculations ( using density functional theory ) of these energies .",

    "the pokrovsky - talapov ( @xmath261 = 3/2 ) critical phenomena near the edge of the smoothly - curved region near a facet has proved to be far more robust and general than originally realized , while novel behavior is predicted in a very special direction . even though invoked in many accounts of sharp edges , long - range attractive @xmath37 do not have an apparent physical basis , except perhaps in idiosyncratic cases .",
    "the likely cause is a reconstruction or adsorption that changes the surface free energy of the facet orientation . on the other hand , hill and valley structures",
    "are widely seen , and the possibility of azimuthal in addition to polar misorientation can lead to astonishingly rich phase diagrams . of course , non equilibrium considerations open up a whole new universe of behavior . furthermore , at the nanoscale cluster shape is very sensitive to the particulars of a system , with the addition or removal of a single atom leading to a substantial change in shape , rather like biological systems , in contrast to the macroscale phenomena that have been treated in this chapter .",
