    "we find that ap is not satisfied for the anomalous cases where @xmath95 .",
    "the major difference between @xmath24 and lower dimensions is that in @xmath24 only a small fraction of the normal modes are localized while in lower dimensions , most of the modes are localized @xcite . hence it is expected that there is no local equilibration in low - dimensions .",
    "then neither the mft nor the ap are satisfied in these regimes .",
    "our study thus suggests that only the assumptions of ( i ) local equilibration and ( ii ) a small current ( requiring @xmath96 ) are necessary for the validity of ap .",
    "the realization of ap in diffusive and anomalous cases should be related to the time - independence in dominant trajectories in the mft @xcite . a verification for this would be an important future problem , but it is not possible within the present approach , and would require simulations with algorithms as in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of anomalous transport in disordered harmonic lattices has some crucial differences from that in low - dimensional nonlinear systems such as fpu chain where levy type of energy diffusion is seen @xcite and temperature profile is always nonlinear . for disordered harmonic crystals",
    "the linear temperature profiles suggest that a local response relation @xmath97 is always valid , but with a size - dependent @xmath64 in the anomalous case . on the other hand levy type of diffusion seen in one - dimensional nonlinear models",
    "means that the response is non - local ( in space ) and the ap may need modification .",
