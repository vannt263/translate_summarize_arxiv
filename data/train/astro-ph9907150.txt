    "narrow line active galactic nuclei form a distinct class of agn on the basis of the properties of their optical / uv spectrum : full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the hydrogen lines and other lines in the range 500 - 2000 km s@xmath7 , intense high ionization lines , and intense feii multiplets ( osterbrock & pogge , @xcite ; shuder & osterbrock , @xcite ) . the weakest of these agn , the narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) , and the somewhat brighter agn with absolute optical luminosity above but close to the lowest limit for quasars of @xmath9 = -23.4 have been extensively studied in the x - ray range ( e.g. laor , fiore , elvis et al . , 1994 ;",
    "boller , brandt & fink , 1996 ; laor et al . , 1997 ) . among all agn ,",
    "the narrow lines agn tend to have the steepest soft x - ray spectra ( rosat ) , and some of them show fast , large amplitude soft x - ray variability with occasionally giant outbursts ( e.g. grupe 1996 and references therein ; boller et al 1996 ) . in the harder 2 - 10 kev band",
    "a comparative study of a large sample of nls1 and broad line seyfert 1s revealed that the 2 - 10 kev asca spectral slopes of nls1 are significantly steeper than those of broad line agn ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) .",
    "recent bepposax observations of a selected sample of bright nls1 ( comastri , fiore , guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 ; comastri , brandt , leighly et al . 1998 ) over the broad 0.1 - 10 kev range indicate that a two component model provides an adequate description of the x  ray continuum .",
    "the relative strengths and slopes of the two components are different from those of broad line seyfert 1s .",
    "the nls1 are characterized by a stronger soft excess and , in general , have a steeper medium energy x - ray power law with respect to normal seyfert 1s , but in pg 1404 + 226 the medium energy spectral index is not very different from that of classical seyfert 1s while its soft excess is strong , very steep and rapidly variable like in other nls1 .",
    "the spectral behaviour of nls1 suggests that the soft x - ray flux can not be due only to disk reprocessing unless there is highly anisotropic emission . in the framework of the thermal models for the x - ray emission in seyfert 1s ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) a strong soft component could lead to a strong compton cooling of the hot corona electrons and to a steep hard tail",
    "this hypothesis is also supported by the similarities between nls1 spectra and those of galactic black hole candidates in their high states first suggested by pounds , done and osborne ( 1995 ) and czerny et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the high states of galactic black hole candidates are thought to be triggered by increases in the accretion rate possibly reaching values close to the eddington limit . in this case",
    "the disk surface is expected to be highly ionized , in good agreement with the observation of a h - like fe edge in tons180 ( comastri et al .",
    "it should also be noted that a high @xmath10 ratio would also be consistent with the narrowness of the optical lines in nls1 if the optical line producing region is virialized as suggested by laor et al .",
    "( 1997 )    the quasar pg 1404 + 226 ( @xmath11 = 0.098 , v = 15 ) is one of the brightest members of the class of narrow line agn .",
    "the optical spectrum of pg 1404 + 226 displays the characteristics of nls1 with fwhm ( h@xmath12 ) @xmath13 830 km s@xmath7 and strong fe ii emission ( boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "+ the observations with the rosat pspc ( @xmath2 0.12.0 kev ) showed a very steep spectrum ( @xmath14 ) with rapid flux ( a factor 2 in 10 hours ) and spectral variability typical of nls1 in the x - ray range , and revealed a complex absorption feature around 0.8 - 1.0 kev ( ulrich & molendi 1996 , thereafter um96 ) .",
    "time resolved spectral analysis showed the data to be consistent with a shift of the absorption feature to higher energy when the source brightens ( um96 ) .",
    "we have obtained a 40 ks asca observation of pg 1404 + 226 in order to investigate the x - ray spectrum over a larger energy range and at higher energy resolution than was possible with rosat . at the time of the asca observations the absorption feature was around 1 kev , at an energy definitely higher than that of the ovii and oviii edges at 0.74 and 0.87",
    "kev commonly seen in asca and rosat spectra of agn ( e.g. reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "preliminary results can be found in comastri , molendi & ulrich ( 1997 , hereafter cmu97 ) .",
    "the asca and rosat data have been fit separately since they have not been obtained at the same epoch .",
    "the challenge presented by pg 1404 + 226 is the identification of the absorption at @xmath15  kev .",
    "brandt et al ( 1994 ) found a similar feature at 1.15 kev in ark 564 and considered several interpretations : neon edge , iron l edges , and outflowing material which would raise the energy edge of oviii ( 0.870 kev ) to the observed energy .",
    "they find none of them to be satisfactory : neon edge because there is only a narrow range of ionization parameter where it would be stronger than the oviii edge ; the iron l edges would produce absorption at other somewhat higher energy ( 1.358 kev ) ; and the outflow seems unlikely because the source of its kinetic energy is unclear .",
    "otani et al ( 1996 ) found a feature at @xmath8  kev in iras 13224 - 3809 for which they suggest an interpretation in terms of outflow , or alternatively and considering that the the x - ray flux of iras 13224 - 3809 varied by a factor 50 in two days `` the ionization state of the medium is far from equilibrium due to the violent variability '' .",
    "krolik & kriss ( 1995 ) drew attention to the fact that  because the ionization timescales of some ions may be as long as the variability timescales in agns , the ionic abundances indicated by the transmission spectra may not be well described by ionization equilibrium \" .",
    "this point has recently been re - investigated by nicastro et al .",
    "( 1999a ) who pointed out also that ( i ) recombination times can be longer than photoionization times resulting in gaseous absorbers which are over - ionized with respect to the equilibrium ionization state and ( ii ) collisional ionization could be of comparable importance to photoionization .",
    "hayashida ( 1997 ) found an edge near 1 kev in h0707 - 495 for which he also suggests an identification with a blushifted oviii absorption edge . for pg 1404 + 226 ,",
    "cmu97 suggested an overabundance of iron , an interpretation which has the advantage to link the origin of the 1 kev absorption to the intense feii lines present in the optical / uv of this quasar and also of iras 13224 - 3809 and ark 564 .",
    "the interpretation where the absorption near @xmath8  kev originates in hot gas outflowing at velocities in the range 0.2 - 0.5c has also been proposed by leighly et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of the asca observations , a re - analysis of the rosat spectra with our warm absorber ( wa ) models calculated with cloudy ( ferland 1993 ) , and an analysis of hst spectra which we have obtained in order to search for uv absorption / emission lines .",
    "the data reduction was carried out in a standard manner and like in um96 the data were split into  high - state and  low - state depending on count rate .",

    "the column density n@xmath25 of the warm material ( i.e. the total column density in hydrogen ) and the ionization parameter u are determined from x - ray spectral fits ( table 1 ) .",
    "u is a measure of the number rate of ionizing photons above the lyman limit and is defined by @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the number rate of incident photons above the lyman limit , @xmath28 is the distance between central source and absorber , @xmath29 is the speed of light , and @xmath30 is the hydrogen density ( fixed to 10@xmath31 @xmath32 unless noted otherwise ) . as detailed below , several models give acceptable fits to the low - state spectrum but none gives a really good fit to the high - state spectrum ( which has a higher signal / noise ratio ) .",
    "a simple power law plus cold absorption gives a very poor fit .",
    "the cold absorbing column generally tends to slightly underpredict the galactic value .",
    "this may reflect some low energy calibration uncertainties , or the presence of an additional spectral component in the form of a very soft excess . adding a soft excess parameterized as a black body which contributes only at very low energies ( e.g. in ngc4051 , komossa & fink 1997 ; ton s180 , fink et al .",

    "_ model a : _ the inclusion of a ` standard ' warm absorber model clearly improves the fit but does not yield an acceptable @xmath33 , with systematic residuals remaining near 1 kev .",
    "the reason is that , even for very high ionization parameters , the model has a strong oxygen absorption at 0.87 kev , even stronger than the neon absorptions ( nevii at @xmath34 1.1 kev and nex at @xmath34 1.36 kev ) .",
    "this is exacerbated at high - state because the high - state data require absorption around the location of the neon edges to dominate .",

    "+ _ model b : _ the addition of the emission and reflection components of the warm material , calculated for a covering factor of 0.5 results in a slightly improved fit , but the high - state data are still not well matched .",
    "one way to make the neon absorption dominate over the oxygen absorption is to introduce deviations from solar abundances , with overabundant neon , or underabundant oxygen . +",
    "several deviation factors were studied between an oxygen abundance of up to o = 0.2 x solar and a neon abundance of ne = 4 x solar .",
    "these models strongly improve the quality of the fit and the values of @xmath33 reach acceptable values ( for the rosat spectra ) .",
    "the best fit has an overabundance of neon of @xmath35 times the solar value .",
    "+ we note that while non solar abundances have been reported in a number of agn / quasars ( e.g. hamann & ferland 1993 , netzer 1997 ) the ratio o / ne is expected to remain close to its solar value in all known astrophysical situations ( on the other hand , netzer occasionally depletes _ oxygen only _ in his photoionisation models , e.g. marshall et al .",

    "the model with overabundance of neon is not compatible with the asca data ( section 3.2.2 ) .",

    "this choice is also corroborated by the rosat results ( um96 ) .",
    "a single power law model clearly does not provide an acceptable fit ( table 2 ) the power law fits reported in table 2 suggest that at least two components are required to fit the overall spectrum . we note that the slope of the hard power law , which could not have been detected by rosat , is consistent with the average quasar slope ( comastri et al .",
    "1992 ) while the slope below 2 kev is consistent with the um96 findings .    in order to model the broad band ( 0.410 kev ) spectrum we tried 4 types of double component",

    "the addition of the absorption edge to the simple blackbody plus power law model produces an improvement in the fit which is significant at @xmath73 ( f - test ) and the residuals are featureless in agreement with the results of leighly et al ( 1997 ) .      as absorption edges are the signature of warm absorbing material , we fit the warm absorber model available in xspec 9.0 ( the model is ` absori ' and the iron abundance is a free parameter ; it was developed by p. magdziarz & a. zdziarski following done et al 1992 and zdziarski , ghisellini , george et al .",
    "1990 ) . given the relatively large numbers of free parameters in this model we have fixed the temperature of the warm material at @xmath74 k ( see for example reynolds & fabian 1995 ; the fits are not sensitive to the temperature , a change of log_t _ from 4.5 to 6 would make no significant difference ) and the iron abundance at the solar value .",
    "in addition we have considered only the 0.53.0 kev energy range in order to avoid contamination from the high energy component .",
    "we were not able to find any acceptable solution as can be judged from figure 3 .",
    "leaving the iron abundance free to vary the improvement is significant at @xmath75% ( f - test ) and the residuals featureless ( fig 4 ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that the huge equivalent width of the iron line is qualitatively consistent ( see figure 3 in reynolds , fabian & inoue , 1995 ) with the supersolar iron abundance found by fitting the data with the warm absorber model .",
    "we have also attempted to fit some warm absorber models ( cloudy based , and with blackbody + power law continuum ) to the asca spectrum and have found no satisfactory fit - the reason being that the edge - like feature at 1 kev is too deep and too narrow for these models .",
    "it has been recently shown that the spectra emerging from ionized gas are strongly modified by resonant absorption if the dispersion velocity in the gas is of the order of 100 km s@xmath7 or greater ( nicastro , fiore , matt 1999b ) .",

    ". such blend of lines would appear as negative residuals in low resolution asca spectra .",
    "the @xmath2 1 kev absorption feature of pg 1404 + 226 could be , at least in part , accounted for by resonant absorption .",
    "signatures of this process have been looked for in the hst uv spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "finally , we have also considered the possibility that the absorption at 1.07 kev is the blueshifted oviii edge whose rest frame energy is 0.87 kev .    we have calculated the optical depth expected for the neon edges at rest energies 1.1 and 1.36 kev which would be blueshifted to 1.29 and 1.55 kev respectively .",
    "for the 1.1 kev line the instrumental upper limit on @xmath44 is 0.14 ( 90% confidence level ) and is 0.27 for the 1.36 kev edge .",
    "we note that with a ` standard ' warm absorber in relativistic outflow the oviii edge is never the `` only '' edge in the spectrum . if the absorber is lowly ionized , there is ovii co - existing and if it is very highly ionized , ovii becomes negligible , but one cannnot avoid having some neon absorption .",
    "although the exact ratios of the optical depths @xmath44 depend on the input parameters , we thought it would be useful to check whether we could detect any other edge , or check how strict the upper limits are .",
    "we take ngc 4051 as basis for comparison . in ngc 4051",
    ", the absorber is rather highly ionized , with oviii being the strongest edge with @xmath44= @xmath83 , then nex with @xmath44=@xmath84 . the ovii edge is weaker with @xmath44=0.35 ; komossa & fink , 1997 .",
    "using the ratio @xmath44@xmath85/@xmath44@xmath86 as typical for the relative depths in a highly ionized absorber , we can conclude that our non - detection of edges other than the one near 1.1 kev in pg1404 + 226 is still consistent with a standard warm absorber i.e. our upper limits on @xmath44 are not strict enough to rule out a warm absorber in relativistic outflow .",

    "the question as to whether uv absorption lines and x - ray absorption lines / edges tend to be present together or separately in agn has been adressed by ulrich ( 1988 ) and more recently by a number of authors ( e.g. schartel et al .",

    "otani et al 1996 ) .",
    "the present analysis indicates that pg1404 + 226 is another such case of multiphase absorbing medium ( but the non - simultaneity of the observations has to be kept in mind ) .    with the detection of x - ray and uv absorption in pg1404 + 226",
    "the statistical association between the presence of uv absorption lines and x - ray absorption edges becomes stronger ( ulrich 1988 , mathur wilkes & elvis 1998 ) .",
    "the two absorbers could be two different gaseous phases , partaking in the same outflow but differing by their physical conditions , velocity and radial distance to the central black hole .",
    "the main results of our analysis can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) the x - ray spectrum of pg 1404 + 226 is variable by a factor 4 in @xmath98 10@xmath99s and is characterized by a strong soft excess below 2 kev whose luminosity ( @xmath100 erg s@xmath7 in the 0.42.0 kev energy range ) is about a factor 3 greater than the 210 kev luminosity ( @xmath101 ) .    the soft excess emission can be described with a high temperature optically thick blackbody ( @xmath102 ev ) .",
    "optically thin models are ruled out combining the observed luminosity with the dimension of the region derived from the variability timescale .",
    "\\2 ) the residuals around 1 kev can be best described by an absorption edge at @xmath103 kev , _ not _ consistent with being caused by highly ionized oxygen at rest in the quasar frame .",
    "a possible explanation could be either in terms of iron overabundance , as suggested by the warm absorber fits and the extremely high ew of the iron k@xmath4 line , or by resonant absorption in a turbulent gas .",
    "the interpretation of a blueshifted oxygen edge in a relativistically outflowing gas is less likely and not supported by the optical  uv data .",
    "x  ray observations of nls1 at high spectral resolution with xmm and _ chandra _ will allow to clarify the origin of the 1 kev absorption detected in pg 1404 + 226 and 3 other nls1 .",
    "\\3 ) two systems of absorption lines separated by @xmath6 km s@xmath7 are identified in the fos / hst spectra in the lines of ly@xmath4 , civ and nv .",
    "one system is located to the red of the emission line peaks . considering that in most radio quiet qsos",
    "the highly ionized emission lines are blueshifted ( as part of an outflow from the face of the accretion disk turned toward us ) we argue that this absorption system is nearly at rest in the agn frame .",
    "its properties are consistent with this absorber being produced in the halo of the host galaxy or a companion . as for the system blueshifted by @xmath6 km s@xmath7 , the very probable detection of ciii@xmath97@xmath931175 ( which has been seen in absorption only in ngc 4151 - bromage et al .",
    "1985 , kriss et al . 1992 ) indicates that this system is intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "\\4 ) with the detection of x - ray and uv absorption in pg1404 + 226 the statistical association between the presence of uv absorption lines and x - ray absorption edges first suggested by ulrich ( 1988 ) is becoming clearer ( mathur wilkes & elvis 1998 ) .",
    "we may be seeing two different absorbers with different physical conditions and locations but both being parts of a grand design outflow .",
    "the differences observed among absorption features in various agn are likely to result from intrinsic differences in the properties of the gaseous outflows , from differences in the aspect angles and from the shape of the x  ray spectrum .",
