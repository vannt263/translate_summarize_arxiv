    "detached dust shells are found around some asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( typically the carbon - rich type ) and their origins are still a matter of debate .",
    "some argue that detached shells indicate episodic mass loss events that lead to two - wind interactions , others suggest detached shells are density enhancements following a temporary increase in the mass loss rate after a thermal pulse . additionally , the role of external forces , such as the interaction of the agb wind with the interstellar medium ( ism ) , can not be discounted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical studies of the formation of detached dust shells and their evolution in the ism target information provided by long wavelength observations . however , shocks and interactions with the ism are better studied with short wavelength observations .",
    "indeed , the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) has revealed a bow shock - like structure ahead of the agb star mira plus a long trailing tail caused by the star s high space velocity through the ism @xcite . targeted observations by galex of the carbon agb star irc+10216 uncovered the interaction of the agb wind with the ism in the star s",
    "astrosphere @xcite .",
    "the most recent discovery of extended emission from agb stars was reported by @xcite , where deep galex observations imaged two half - ringed structures around the carbon agb star cit  6 in the fuv . however , with such few detections , the frequency and physical characteristics of extended uv emission is uncertain .    in this letter , we present our discovery and analysis of extended fuv and nuv emission from the carbon agb star u hya from galex all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) observations .",
    "we find that extended fuv and nuv emission is spatially coincident with the detached dust shell initially discovered in the infrared with iras and recently studied with the akari satellite and the herschel space observatory .",
    "we discuss the most likely origin of the uv emission and the questions posed by this discovery .",
    "our discovery of an extended ring of uv emission around u hya marks the third discovery of extended uv emission from a carbon agb star and the first of an agb star with a detached shell .",
    "this particular discovery of extended emission from shallow galex ais exposures is remarkable given that previous examples required exposures that were two orders of magnitude longer , leading some authors to suggest that this type of extended emission would likely not be observable in short galex exposures @xcite .",
    "rather , we suggest that the existing archive of observations is a potential trove of similar detections in a much larger sample of agb stars .      +",
    "observations were performed by the galex satellite observatory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as part of the all - sky survey for 198 seconds in the nuv ( 1771 - 2831  ) and fuv ( 1344 - 1786  ) bandpasses on 26 march 2006 .",
    "we retrieved the fuv and nuv images sampled at a resolution of @xmath3 per pixel from the galex archive using _",
    "galexview_. the point spread function of the galex imaging system has a core fwhm of @xmath4 .",
    "the agb star itself is apparently detected in both the fuv and nuv bands with _ galexview _ catalog fluxes ( provided in table  [ fluxes ] ) . in the fuv image , a faint ring of emission",
    "can be seen at @xmath0 , but this ring is not immediately apparent in the nuv image ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the fuv and nuv images required additional analysis to establish the existence and characteristics of the extended uv emission . as described in the following , we identified and removed likely foreground and background field sources , characterized the distribution of the uv emission by studying the bright emission spots , and measured the surface brightness radial profiles with respect to the agb star .",
    "we selected field sources for removal by identifying stellar and extragalactic counterparts to the uv point - like sources .",
    "we used images and source catalogs from the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) to make the identifications .",
    "pixels corresponding to the uv emission from stellar or extragalactic sources were replaced with a poisson - distributed noise pattern drawn from a source - free region in the vicinity of the removed source .",
    "images with and without field sources are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] , where we have also smoothed the images with a 2d gaussian kernel that has a fwmh of @xmath5 .",
    "the extended fuv emission appears as a distribution of bright spots on a ring - like structure .",
    "we determined the distribution of the bright spots of fuv emission seen in figure  [ fig1 ] by visually identifying the brightest spots of emission from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "we found no compelling evidence for corresponding bright spots in the nuv image . using the coordinates of these bright fuv spots we performed a least - squares fit to an ellipse with the semi - major / semi - minor axis , position angle , and the coordinates of the ellipse center as free parameters .",
    "a bootstrapping method is used to estimate the best - fit errors by adding normally - distributed noise ( @xmath8 ) to the bright spot coordinates and selecting 9 spots at random for each of the 10,000 least square fits . from the parameter statistics of the 10,000 trials we estimate that the best - fit ellipse has semi - major and semi - minor axes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and the semi - major axis has a position angle of @xmath11 .",
    "the uncertain position angle of the semi - major axis is approximately consistent with the proper motion vector of u hya , suggesting the ellipsoidal shape may be due to the shell s motion , while the misalignment may suggest asymmetries in the ism .",
    "the best - fit ellipse is overlaid upon the fuv and nuv images along with the proper motion vector of u hya in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit ellipse centroid is offset from the celestial coordinates of u hya by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 = [ -3\\farcs1 , -2\\farcs0]$ ] ) , which is within the ellipse centroid error estimate of @xmath14 .",
    "however , the central fuv point source location is less consistent with the celestial position of u hya than the brighter central nuv point source .",
    "the fuv central point source is offset from the celestial coordinates of u hya by @xmath15 ( @xmath13 = [ + 5\\farcs0 , -1\\farcs0]$ ] ) and @xmath16 from the ellipse centroid .",
    "given the galex astrometric accuracy of @xmath17 , the offset of the fuv central source is significant and considered further in  [ section_peculiar ] .    as a final remark on the distribution of the fuv emission ,",
    "we note a faint incomplete radial  spoke \"- like feature at a position angle between @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the integrated background - subtracted flux of the spoke - like feature is @xmath20 , hence , it is only tentatively detected .",
    "however , the position angle of this feature is opposite the star s proper motion suggesting the potential association with the past position of u hya ( see  [ section_peculiar ] ) .    , bins closest to the central point source emission",
    "are indicated with upward pointing arrows because their emission lies beyond the plot range.[fig2],title=\"fig : \" ] , bins closest to the central point source emission are indicated with upward pointing arrows because their emission lies beyond the plot range.[fig2],title=\"fig : \" ]      we extracted surface brightness measurements from 18 nested circular annuli and one central circular aperture for both fuv and nuv images .",
    "each annulus is centered on the celestial coordinates of u hya and has a width of @xmath21 , the central circular aperture has a radius of @xmath21 .",
    "the four farthest annuli ( from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) were used to estimate the total background ( sky and detector ) surface brightness .",
    "we estimate the fuv and nuv background surface brightness is @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . for each annulus",
    "we use the background - subtracted counts to estimate the source poisson error then add this in quadrature to the background error to determine the source error .",
    "we converted the total background - subtracted count rates ( cps ) to fluxes using the relationships from @xcite and the galex online documentation .",
    "the resulting fuv and nuv background - subtracted surface brightness radial profiles are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the radial profiles begin at the position of the stellar point source and reach a maximum between @xmath26 and @xmath7 , with the peak at @xmath27 . at a distance of 208 pc",
    ", this peak corresponds to a radius of @xmath28  pc from the celestial position of u hya .",
    "the radial profile behavior is consistent with a shell - like structure that forms a ring when projected onto the sky .",
    "although the ring is not apparent in the nuv image , it is revealed in the surface brightness radial profile ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .    in the fuv radial profile , a single radial bin near",
    "@xmath29 rises @xmath30 above the background .",
    "examination of this radius in figure  [ fig1 ] suggests a faint semi - circular arc in the southern half of the fuv image . there is no clear evidence for a similar feature in the nuv image nor in the nuv radial profile .",
    "however , the broad shoulders of the nuv imaging psf extend to @xmath31 , making the identification of such a peak more difficult in the high background image .",
    "we have calculated the total background - subtracted fuv and nuv fluxes in these rings by integrating the surface brightness flux from @xmath32 to @xmath33 for the inner ring and @xmath34 to @xmath35 for the outer ring and associated errors added in quadrature . variations within the annuli , like the bright spots studied in  [ section_fuvdistribution ] , are not included in the error budget .",
    "these variations may be due to statistical fluctuations but could also indicate clumps of emitting material ( see  [ section_h2 ] ) .",
    "the total fuv and nuv fluxes for these shells are reported in table  [ fluxes ] .      to identify the spatial relationship of the uv emission with respect to the ir - emitting dust shell",
    ", we overlaid contours of the fuv emission onto the 70@xmath36 _ herschel _ photoconductor array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) image .",
    "the 70@xmath36 pacs imaging psf is comparable to that of galex ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the best - fit ellipse and location of the fuv emission ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) suggest that the uv is coincident , within astrometric and resolution uncertainties , with @xmath37 dust emission ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "we trace the origin of the extended uv emission by considering the most likely scenarios that could explain the uv emission .",
    "the physical processes considered are scattering of uv photons , shocks formed when the agb wind encounters the ism , shocks from the star s motion through the ism , or , excitation of molecular hydrogen .",
    "these processes are not mutually exclusive and they may all occur simultaneously to some degree .",
    "given the spatial relationship of the ir and uv emission ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , we consider the possibility that uv photons are scattered by the dust shell into our line of sight .",
    "scattering of this type is seen in optical observations of numerous agb stars with dust shells including u hya @xcite .",
    "the scattering efficiency increases at shorter wavelengths and the scattered flux and distribution can be used to infer the dust shell properties .",
    "however , in our case , we used this formulation and ir dust shell properties to estimate the fraction of central fuv and nuv flux scattered by the dust shell ( see table  [ fluxes ] ) .",
    "we conclude that scattering of the central source by the dust shell can only account for @xmath49 of the extended uv emission .",
    "scattering of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) by the dust shell is another potential source of the extended uv emission from u hya .",
    "the expected contributions from fuv and nuv flux densities ( in @xmath50 ) due to scattering of the isrf by dense regions of the ism is roughly equal due to the respective bandpasses and the uv extinction curve @xcite .",
    "if this proportionality holds in the dust shell of u hya , then assuming all the nuv flux from the dust shell arises from scattering of the isrf , we can only account for @xmath1 of the fuv flux .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that the fuv flux is caused by the scattering processes alone .",
    "instead , we suggest that shocks are responsible for some or all of the fuv and nuv emission from the detached dust shell of u hya .",
    "our next clue that shocks might be responsible for the extended fuv and nuv emission can be seen in figures  [ fig1]&[fig3 ] , where the fuv ring is brightest in the direction of the star s proper motion .",
    "the peculiar velocity of u hya , is capable of producing post - shock temperatures of @xmath51 , for strong shock conditions and a typical mean molecular mass , @xmath52 .",
    "such a high - temperature shock is consistent with the increasing flux towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "similar characteristics are seen in galex image of irc+10216 , where the relative motion of the star with respect to the ism forms a strong shock with a post - shock temperature of about @xmath53 @xcite . however , unlike irc+10216 , where the extended nuv emission leads the fuv emission , in u hya the fuv and nuv extended emission are coincident with tentative evidence that the fuv emission actually leads the nuv emission .",
    "but the larger distance to u hya and short exposure time ( more than two orders of magnitude shorter than the observation of irc+10216 ) make it difficult to determine the precise spatial relationship of the uv emission .",
    "we note , however , that there is no apparent bow shock structure expected from the interaction with the ism in the pacs images .",
    "this is likely due to a combination of the slower peculiar velocity of u hya and a lower ism density .",
    "alternatively , collisional excitation of h@xmath2 by hot electrons in a low - density shocked gas might explain the enhancement of the fuv emission , similar to the long - lived fuv tail of mira @xcite .",
    "the molecular composition of the detached shell around u hya is poorly - studied .",
    "argued that the dynamical age of the detached dust shell suggests that despite self - shielding , co molecules should be disassociated by now due to the isrf .",
    "the survival of h@xmath2 against disassociation by the isrf is less clear but the typically higher abundance of h@xmath2 suggests it could survive after all the co has been disassociated . if both co and h@xmath2 molecules have survived disassociation by the isrf , they are likely to do so in clumps like those seen in scattered light around the detached shell of r scl and u cam",
    ". such clumps would be consistent with the observed morphology of the fuv emission as a series of bright spots on an elliptical ring , but the low - signal in our shallow exposures limit our ability to assert a clumpy environment .      in ",
    "[ section_fuvdistribution ] , we highlighted two peculiar features of the fuv emission , the apparent offset of the fuv central point source from the celestial position of u hya by @xmath54 and the faint spoke - like feature opposite the star s proper motion .",
    "since the bright nuv central point source coincides with the celestial coordinates of u hya within galex astrometric uncertainty , we tentatively conclude that the offset of the central fuv source from the star is real .",
    "this offset might suggest a heretofore unknown distant ( up to 1000 au ) hot companion , similar to that suggested for other galex detections of agb stars @xcite .",
    "however , because the offset lies in the direction of u hya s motion ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) , it may suggest shocks caused by the star s motion . but",
    "the presence of a detached shell implies there is no ism near the star , so such shocks would have to arise from an exotic scenario where the star plows into its own wind . in the opposite direction of the proper motion ,",
    "the spoke - like feature seen in the fuv is reminiscent of mira s long trailing tail @xcite , albeit a smaller version .",
    "mira s tail covers 30,000 years of mass loss where as the purported tail of u hya covers only @xmath55 years assuming its length is @xmath56 .",
    "if confirmed , this tail of emission can be used to constrain the mass loss history since the formation of the dust shell that has a dynamical age of @xmath578,000 years .",
    "we recommend further study to confirm the origin and extent of these features from u hya .",
    "analysis of archival galex ais observations of u hya establishes the detection of extended ultraviolet emission in the nuv and fuv for the first time in an agb star with a detached dust shell and only the third of this type of emission from a carbon agb star .",
    "the fuv the emission appears as a series of bright spots that together form a ring - like structure similar in size to that of the ir - emitting detached dust shell ( figures  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the radius is approximately @xmath58 , but is better described by an ellipse with a semi major axis of @xmath59 and semi minor axis of @xmath60 , the semi - major axis appears projected onto the plane of the sky with a position angle of @xmath61 . in the nuv ,",
    "the extended emission is not apparent in the image ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) but is recovered in surface brightness profiles ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "based on these profiles , the extended nuv emission has a similar , if not smaller , with a radius of approximately @xmath62 .",
    "we measured the total flux from the surface brightness profiles and compared it to that expected from scattering by the dust shell using the dust shell properties derived from infrared observations .",
    "we conclude that scattering by the central star is insufficient to explain the uv emission and scattering by the isrf can not be ruled out .",
    "however , assuming all the nuv arises from scattering of the isrf , @xmath63 of the fuv flux remains unexplained .",
    "based on the peculiar velocity of u hya and the enhanced flux in the direction of the star s proper motion , we conclude that some or all of the nuv flux and most of fuv flux arises from shocks caused by the star s motion through the ism .",
    "this discovery of extended uv emission from u hya , along with that of carbon stars irc+10216 and cit 6 , leads one to speculate if this type of uv emission is a common trait of the circumstellar envelopes around carbon agb stars , high - velocity agb stars , or inherent to the formation of the detached shell .",
    "other than their classification as carbon agb stars , these three sources of extended uv emission are dissimilar .",
    "a thorough survey of galex uv observations of agb stars that utilizes the techniques developed here is underway to establish the origin(s ) and frequency of this type of uv emission from these cold , dusty environments .",
