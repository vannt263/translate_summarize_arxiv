    "with the rapid development in quantum information processing , high - dimensional entanglement is increasingly drawing attention of researchers due to its more superior security than qubit entanglement in the field of quantum key distribution and its greater violation of local realism  @xcite .",
    "thus , the generation of high - dimensional entanglement is of great importance .",
    "up to present , a large number of schemes have been proposed for generating high - dimensional entanglement via various techniques  @xcite . among these techniques , stimulated raman adiabatic passage  ( stirap ) is widely used in fields of time - dependent interaction for many purposes  @xcite because of its robustness against atomic spontaneous emissions and variations in experimental parameters .",
    "however , stirap usually requires a relatively long interaction time for restraining non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "a set of techniques called  shortcuts to adiabaticity  ( sta ) \" are promising for quantum information processing which actually fights against the decoherence , noise , or losses that are accumulated during a long operation time .",
    "hence , many schemes are proposed to construct sta  @xcite . by using sta , a great deal of remarkable achievements",
    "have been made in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "also , numerous schemes have been come up with for fast generating high - dimensional entanglement  @xcite , in which chen @xmath0 and he @xmath0 prepared a three - atom singlet state  @xcite and a two - atom 3d entangled state  @xcite , respectively , by using transitionless quantum driving  ( tqd ) ; lin @xmath0  @xcite and wu @xmath0  @xcite implemented two - atom 3d entangled states , respectively , based on lewis - riesenfeld invariants  ( lri ) ; wu @xmath0 also generated three - atom tree - type 3d entangled states with both of tqd and lri  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose a superadiabatic scheme for fast generating two - atom 3d entanglement via superadiabatic iterations .",
    "superadiabatic iterations as an extension of the traditional adiabatic approximation was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the technique was adopted for speeding up adiabatic process first by ibez @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a short time before , song @xmath0 extended it to a three - level system  @xcite .",
    "more recently , huang @xmath0  @xcite and kang  @xcite generated greenberger ",
    "zeilinger state and @xmath1 state , respectively , by using this technique .",
    "now we apply this technique to the fast generation of two - atom 3d entanglement . apart from the rapid rate ,",
    "we implement two - atom 3d entanglement with pretty high fidelity . more importantly , as the second iteration different from the first iteration  ( i.e. , tqd )",
    ", the superadiabatic scheme does not need an additional coupling between the initial and finial states , and the same form of counterdiabatic hamiltonian as that of effective hamiltonian guarantees its high feasibility in experiment .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : the physical model and effective dynamics are shown in section  2 . in section 3 , we give the superadiabatic scheme for fast generating 3d entanglement between two atoms . in section  4 ,",
    "numerical simulation results prove that the scheme is fast , valid and robust .",
    "the conclusion is given in section  5 .",
    "the schematic sketch of the physical model for fast generating two - atom 3d entanglement is shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "there are two atoms trapped , respectively , in two spatially separated bimodule cavities connected by a fiber which satisfies the short fiber limit to ensure that only resonant modes of the fiber interact with cavity modes  @xcite .",
    "two atoms both have three ground states @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , atom a has one excited state @xmath5 and atom b has two excited states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "atomic transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are resonantly coupled to the left(right)-circularly polarized modes of cavity a and cavity b , respectively , with corresponding coupling constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "transitions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are resonantly driven by classical laser fields , respectively , with rabi frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then , the interaction hamiltonian of the atom - cavity - fiber system is  ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 + \\rm h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the annihilation operator of left(right)-circularly polarized mode of cavity a(b ) and the fiber , respectively ; @xmath20 is the coupling strength between the two cavities and the fiber . for convenience , we assume @xmath21 is real , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if the initial state of the whole system is @xmath24 denoting two atoms both in state @xmath3 and two cavities and the fiber all in the vacuum state , hamiltonian  ( [ e1 ] ) can be rewritten by @xmath25 for which @xmath26 denotes a single left(right)-circularly polarized photon state .",

    "may be @xmath54 , which is written in @xmath55 frame by @xmath56 cd hamiltonian  ( [ e12 ] ) needs a direct coupling between @xmath30 and @xmath57 , which is too hard to implement in practice for such a complex system .",

    "we regard @xmath68 and @xmath69 as two auxiliary pulses added to the pulses @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . then modified pulses @xmath72 and @xmath73 can drive the effective system to evolve along one of the superadiabatic state in equation  ( [ e13 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if related parameters meet time boundary conditions @xmath74  ( @xmath75 is the final time ) , @xmath76 will act as a medium state for achieving the expected transformation @xmath77 . by this way",
    ", we obtain the 3d entanglement between two atoms in the superadiabatic scheme @xmath78",
    "for meeting @xmath74 , we choose @xmath71 and @xmath70 as  @xcite @xmath79+\\omega_0\\exp[-(t - t_f/2+t_0)^2/t_c^2],\\nonumber\\\\ \\omega_1(t)&=&-\\frac{\\sqrt2}{\\sqrt3}\\omega_0\\exp[-(t - t_f/2-t_0)^2/t_c^2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with two related gaussian parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in figure",
    "[ f2 ] , we plot the time dependence of @xmath82 and @xmath83 determined by @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath84 can be always satisfied well with an arbitrary value of @xmath85 , while @xmath86 can be satisfied well only with a large enough value of @xmath85 . in order to choose suitable parameters , in figure  [ f3](a ) , we plot the final fidelity @xmath87 versus @xmath88 and @xmath85 in the superadiabatic scheme , in which @xmath89 is the final state of the whole system governed by hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) with rabi frequencies @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "as a contrast , in figure  [ f3](b ) , we plot the final fidelity in the stirap scheme with rabi frequencies @xmath92 and @xmath93 . by converting the relation @xmath94 into @xmath95",

    ", we see that the curve for @xmath100  ( @xmath101 ) is very close to that for @xmath102  ( @xmath99 ) . in the following , for showing the effectiveness of two alternative rabi frequencies , in figure  [ f5](a ) we plot time dependence of the fidelity for adopting @xmath102 and @xmath99 or @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "highly approximate coincidences of two pairs of curves indicate that the alternative rabi frequencies are pretty valid . for a further illustration , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , in figure  [ f5](b ) we plot time evolutions of the populations for all states in equation  ( [ e3 ] ) , respectively , and the results show that the desired two - atom 3d entanglement @xmath106 can be obtained near perfectly at @xmath107 .",
    "what s more , we also see that the states not involved in @xmath106 are hardly populated .",
    "since most parameters are impossible to control perfectly in experiment , we should investigate the robustness of the scheme against variations in control parameters .",
    "here we define @xmath108 as the deviation of @xmath109 , in which @xmath109 denotes the ideal value and @xmath110 denotes the actual value . in figure  [ f6 ] , we consider effects of variations in parameters involved in the superadiabatic scheme on the final fidelity for fast generating the 3d entanglement between two atoms . as we can see from figure  [ f6 ] , the final fidelity always keep over @xmath111 even when variations in two of parameters we consider are both up to @xmath112 , which indicates the superadiabatic scheme for fast generating the two - atom 3d entanglement is extremely robust against variations in control parameters . by the way",
    ", figure  [ f6](d ) also shows the condition @xmath113 is a little bit critical for the high - fidelity generation of the target state .    finally ,",
