    "it is now widely believed that neutron stars possess strong magnetic fields .",
    "these arise during the creation process of neutron stars , when ordinary heavy stars with burnt - out cores undergo catastrophic contraction after losing their hydrostatic stability . in this case , since the magnetic field is `` frozen '' into the stellar matter , the magnetic flux through the surface of the star is conserved , and the resultant compact objects have magnetic fields with a strength of  @xmath0 .",
    "even stronger magnetic fields on the order of @xmath1 are believed to exist in so - called magnetars  @xcite .",
    "much research has been devoted to stellar magnetic fields , including those existing in neutron stars ( see , e.g. , the book  @xcite and more recent works @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "studies show that the structure of the interior magnetic fields and their stability depend crucially on the properties of matter at extreme densities , which are typical for the interior regions of a neutron star . such extreme magnetic fields play an important role in the physics of neutron stars , affecting their interior structure and determining their evolution in time , such as the magnetic dipole radiation , the deformation due to the magnetic stress , etc .",
    "here we show that , apart from the properties of the neutron matter , the structure of the interior magnetic fields may also be substantially influenced by the topology of the spacetime . for this purpose , we consider mixed configurations with nontrivial topology which consist both of ordinary and exotic matter .",
    "the latter is some special form of matter , which implicates the violation of the null energy condition . in the language of hydrodynamics",
    "this corresponds to large negative effective pressures , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents the energy density .    in our previous works we have studied such mixed systems for the case where the nontrivial ( wormhole ) topology is provided by exotic matter in the form of a ghost scalar field , and",
    "the ordinary matter is chosen in the form of relativistic neutron matter ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , where the motivation to consider this type of objects is also discussed ) .",
    "the resulting neutron - star - plus - wormhole configurations then possess properties of wormholes and of ordinary stars . on the one hand , for a distant observer , they look like ordinary neutron stars with typical masses and sizes . on the other hand , such mixed systems may have some new distinctive characteristics which could , in principle , be traced in astrophysical observations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    here",
    "we add to such mixed systems a magnetic field associated with the neutron matter .",
    "our goal is to clarify the question of how the presence of the wormhole influences the distribution and intensity of the magnetic field inside the neutron matter .",
    "to describe the structure of the magnetic field , we employ a simplified model of a dipole magnetic field as discussed in ref .",
    "namely , we consider an axisymmetric , poloidal magnetic field produced by toroidal electric currents , preserving the circularity property of spacetime  @xcite . in the presence of such a field ,",
    "the matter configurations retain only axial symmetry . however , since in ordinary neutron stars the energy density of the magnetic field is much smaller than the energy density of the neutron matter , we follow ref .  @xcite and make a perturbative expansion of the field equations , including perturbations up to second order .",
    "we use these perturbed equations to derive an equation for the current which can not be arbitrarily chosen but follows from an integrability condition for the perturbation equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ statem_prob ] we present the statement of the problem and derive the corresponding general - relativistic equations for the mixed systems under consideration . in sec .",
    "[ num_calc ] we numerically solve these equations for ordinary magnetized neutron stars and for mixed configurations with different choices for the parameters of the systems . comparing the results ,",
    "we demonstrate the influence of the nontrivial topology on the structure and strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "we perform a linear stability analysis for these configurations in sec .",
    "[ stabi ] . finally , in sec .  [ conclusion ]",
    "we summarize the results obtained .",
    "here we consider mixed systems consisting of a gravitating ghost scalar field @xmath4 ( taken for simplicity to be massless ) and strongly magnetized neutron matter .",
    "the scalar field allows for the presence of a nontrivial wormhole - like topology of the system .",
    "the wormhole is threaded by magnetized neutron matter .",
    "the lagrangian for this system can be presented in the form @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor , and @xmath8 is the lagrangian of the neutron fluid .",
    "we assume that the neutron fluid can in general be anisotropic .",
    "the latter means that the radial and tangential components of its pressure are not equal to each other .",
    "such a situation may arise at high densities of the neutron matter  @xcite . to describe the anisotropy",
    ", we here employ one of the approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite , and obtain the following components of the fluid energy - momentum tensor ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath9 where the radial and the tangential components of the pressure are @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a parameter determining the anisotropy of the fluid , i.e. , the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath12 is the pressure appearing in the equation of state ( eos ) [ see eq .   below ] . using these expressions , one can eliminate @xmath12 , and obtain the following relation between the pressure components : @xmath13 while at the moment the eos of neutron matter at high densities is still unknown , the literature in the field offers numerous proposals for the eos , derived from a variety of physical assumptions  @xcite . for our purpose , we restrict ourselves to a simplified variant of the eos , where a more or less realistic neutron matter eos is approximated in the form of a polytropic eos .",
    "this eos can be taken in the following form : @xmath14 with the constant @xmath15 , the polytropic index @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denotes the rest - mass density of the neutron fluid . here",
    "@xmath3 is the energy density of the fluid , @xmath18 is the baryon number density , @xmath19 is a characteristic value of @xmath18 , @xmath20 is the baryon mass , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are parameters whose values depend on the properties of the neutron matter .    as in our previous investigations concerning mixed star - plus - wormhole systems @xcite ,",
    "we here , for simplicity , take only one set of parameters for the neutron fluid .",
    "namely , we choose @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we employ these values for the parameters in the numerical calculations of sec .",
    "[ num_calc ] .",
    "let us now consider the field equations for the mixed neutron - star - plus - wormhole systems with a dipole magnetic field .",
    "strongly magnetized relativistic stars would , in general , possess a nonspherical shape because of a substantial magnetic pressure .",
    "however , for values of the magnetic field strength on the order of @xmath27 , deviations from the spherical shape are negligible , since the energy of the magnetic field is considerably smaller than the gravitational energy  @xcite , and only for much higher values of the magnetic field strength the deformation of the star will become substantial .",
    "therefore , at first sight it seems appropriate to evaluate the metric only to lowest order , i.e. , in the spherically symmetric approximation , where the deformation of the star is neglected .",
    "since we here neither consider the rotation of the star , we may thus take the following static spherically symmetric line element in polar gaussian coordinates @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath31 only , and @xmath32 is the time coordinate . with this line element",
    "we then obtain a set of ordinary differential equations for the metric functions , the fluid and the scalar field .",
    "we refer to these equations as the _ background equations_.    having solved the background equations , and restricting to a dipole field , we would like to evaluate the magnetic field in this spherically symmetric background , requiring a certain strength at the boundary of the star .",
    "the maxwell equation then involves a current as source term .",
    "however , this current can not be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "it must satisfy an integrability condition @xcite . in the case of isotropic neutron matter , the current equation is easily integrated . but",
    "in the case of anisotropic neutron matter a consistent solution of the current equation requires the determination of the second order perturbations of the metric .    in the following",
    "we first give the set of background equations .",
    "next we discuss the equation for the magnetic field and the second order perturbations for the metric , necessary for obtaining the integrability condition of the current .      to obtain the background equations",

    "in the first case , the magnetic field and the current are very similar to those of a mixed system with an isotropic fluid ,  ( i ) . in the second case , however , the magnetic field and the current differ quite strongly from those obtained for systems whose maximum density is residing at the center , as seen in fig .",

    "the current can take negative values in the interior region , and very small values at the center .",
    "the magnetic field lines of these systems then are much more akin to those of ordinary neutron stars , with only little magnetic flux penetrating the throat .",

    "this pervasive instability is in contrast to ordinary neutron stars , which always possess a stable branch , also in the case of anisotropic neutron fluids  @xcite .",
