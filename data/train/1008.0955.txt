    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semi - detached binaries with a white dwarf ( wd ) primary and a low - mass companion which transfers mass to a wd through roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the observed orbital period distribution of cvs has three important features : a sharp short period cut - off at the orbital period of @xmath10 min , referred to as the `` minimum period '' , the period gap , a dearth of systems with periods between @xmath11 min and @xmath12 min @xcite , and the `` period minimum spike '' , a significant accumulation of systems at @xmath13@xmath14 min @xcite . for cvs with period above @xmath15 ,",
    "the dominant angular momentum loss mechanism is thought to be the magnetic braking , while the gravitational radiation may be responsible for the angular momentum loss for cvs below @xmath16 . in this work ,",
    "we focus on cvs only with @xmath17 .",
    "a characteristic feature of cvs is the mass transfer from a secondary to a wd .",
    "since the gas stream carries substantial angular momentum , it forms an accretion disk around the wd .",
    "the reaction of a cv on the mass transfer can be qualitatively understood with the help of the dimensionless parameter @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the mass - loss and kelvin - helmholtz timescales of the donor , respectively @xcite . at the initial phase of mass transfer , @xmath21 , so that the donor remains close to thermal equilibrium and thus follows the mass - radius relation ( mrr ) of main - sequence stars @xmath22 with the effective mass - radius exponent @xmath23 close to @xmath24 @xcite . here",
    ", the subscript `` 2 '' denotes the quantities of cv donors . both @xmath25 and @xmath1 of the cv decrease as the donor keeps losing mass during this early phase of cv evolution .",
    "as the mass transfer continues , the binary shrinks due to the angular momentum loss , reducing @xmath26 . when @xmath19 and @xmath20 become comparable to each other ( @xmath27 )",
    ", the donor becomes out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "since the surface luminosity is no longer in balance with the nuclear luminosity , the donor expands , causing @xmath23 to decrease with time @xcite . using the hayashi theory and homologous approximation ,",
    "@xcite studied the reaction of the donor to mass loss and found that @xmath25 increases with decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "observations confirm this theoretical prediction , showing that the radii of donors in short - period cvs are @xmath28@xmath29 larger than those of isolated main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "the effective mass - radius exponent @xmath23 becomes smaller as @xmath30 decreases towards the brawn dwarfs masses .",
    "the change in the mrr of donors slows down the temporal change in the orbital period as the donor continues losing mass .",
    "the orbital period reaches a minimum value when @xmath31 at which @xmath32 @xcite . as @xmath26 decreases further , @xmath23 declines to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this in turn leads to an increase in @xmath1 .",
    "such a turnaround of the orbital period at @xmath34 is referred to as the `` period bounce '' .",
    "the evolutionary scenario described above suggests that the mass - loss rates @xmath2 ( and the related thermal relaxation ) of donors control the evolution of cvs .",
    "it also implies that the observed distribution of cvs versus the orbital period may be a consequence of a certain relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath35 not only provides a way to estimate the ages of cvs but also can be used to check the dominant mechanism for angular momentum loss , finding a reliable @xmath1@xmath2 relationship is of great importance in understanding cv evolution .",
    "there have been numerous studies to derive the @xmath1@xmath2 relation ; these can be categorized into two groups : purely theoretical work ( e.g. , @xcite ) and semi - empirical work ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the first , theoretical studies made use of stellar evolution codes combined with the analytical mass - transfer models of @xcite or others .",
    "the common results of these numerical experiments are that ( 1 ) the orbital period exhibits the turnaround behavior at @xmath34 that is about @xmath36 smaller than the observed @xmath37 @xcite and ( 2 ) compared to isolated stars , the secondaries in short - period cvs are oversized due to the mass loss but only by @xmath28@xmath38 , which is about a factor @xmath39@xmath40 smaller than the observed cv sizes .",
    "since the bloating of the donor depends on the efficiency of the mass loss , these results suggest either the numerical models underestimate @xmath2 above @xmath34 , or the efficiency of the angular momentum loss is higher than expected @xcite . despite the attempts to include the effects of tidal and rotational perturbations @xcite , additional angular momentum loss via magnetic braking @xcite , accretion disk winds and magnetic propeller ( see @xcite for review ) , etc . , clear explanations for the discrepancies between @xmath34 and @xmath37 and between the empirical and numerical mrrs have yet to be found .",
    "the second , semi - empirical approach uses , for instance , the effective temperatures of wds @xcite or accretion disk luminosities @xcite to infer the accretion rates @xmath41 .",
    "the physical basis for the former is that wds in cvs are observed to be hotter than expected from their ages @xcite , and such  overheating \" of wds may be a result of the compressional heating due to the gas piled up on their surfaces @xcite . for the latter method ,",
    "the accretion luminosities can give direct information on @xmath41 if the disk properties are well constrained . when applied to dwarf novae ( dne ) that accrete sporadically and have thermally unstable disks , @xmath41 calculated from the two methods have a different scatter for given @xmath1 .",
    "the mass - transfer rates based on the accretion luminosities probably measure an accretion rate averaged over short time intervals , e.g. , a few decades , which makes them quite sensitive to short - time disk variability @xcite .",
    "this inevitably leads to a high dispersion in @xmath41 estimated from the disk luminosities . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective temperatures of wds are likely to give a relatively long - term averaged @xmath41 , although this method may suffer from uncertainties related to unknown properties such as masses and radii of wds as well as some auxiliary assumptions on their structures and boundary layers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we construct another semi - empirical relation between the mass - loss rate and the orbital period , and compare the result with those of the purely theoretical and the semi - empirical approaches mentioned above .",
    "we start from the empirical mrr of @xcite for superhumping cvs , and apply the homologous approximation in order to calculate the dependencies of the effective temperature and gravothermal luminosity upon the bloating of the donor . assuming that the observed mrr of cv donors is a consequence of the mass loss and thermal relaxation processes , we calculate the mass - loss rates .",
    "we will show that the resulting mass - loss rates are broadly in line with those on the basis of the effective temperatures of wds , while different from those of the purely theoretical models of @xcite .",
    "we will also show that our results are consistent with the angular momentum loss of cvs due primarily to the emission of gravitational waves . since radii of cv donors likely trace the long - term evolution of @xmath2 @xcite and depend only weakly on details of the mass - transfer processes , the resulting mass - loss rates from the empirical mrr are less model - dependent and less sensitive to the short - term effects than the other semi - empirical estimates that rely on accretion activities .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec_p_te ] , we introduce the theoretical mrr for isolated single stars and the empirical mrr for cvs donors , and define the bloating factor .",
    "we then describe a method to find the effective temperature and gravothermal luminosity of donors by using the bloating factor . in ",
    "[ sec_dm ] , we calculate the semi - empirical mass - loss rate , construct the mass - loss history to estimate the cv ages , and show that the derived mass - loss rate is consistent with cv evolution by angular momentum loss via the emission of gravitational waves . in ",
    "[ sec_dis ] , we apply our results to selected eclipsing short - period cvs and show that the semi - empirical mass - loss rate is consistent with the accretion rates inferred from the effective temperatures of wds .",
    "we also suggest a way to estimate the effective temperatures of donors assuming that mass is conserved .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  [ sec_con ] .",
    "we consider a cv consisting of a wd ( or accretor ) with mass @xmath42 and a secondary ( or donor ) with mass @xmath30 , radius @xmath25 , and effective temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the donor fills its critical equipotential surface . in accordance with the results of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we assume @xmath43 throughout this paper .",
    "we use an additional subscript `` 0 '' to denote the quantities of isolated , single stars in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium to which cv secondaries will be compared . in this section",
    ", we use the empirical relationship between masses and radii of cv secondaries to calculate the bloating factor in comparison with the single stars of the same mass .",
    "we then treat the bloating factor as perturbations to the properties of single stars in order to find the orbital period , effective temperature , and gravothermal luminosity of cvs .      as the mrrs of single stars that we use as the references to those of cv secondaries",
    ", we take _ composite _ relations constructed in a manner similar to @xcite : the bcah98 isochrone of @xcite for stars with @xmath44 , the dusty isochrone of @xcite for @xmath45 ( @xmath46 k ) , and the cond isochrone of @xcite for @xmath47 .",
    "there are quite large uncertainties in the estimation of cv ages .",
    "period bouncers are thought of as a final stage of cv evolution , suggesting that they are older than their `` parent '' cvs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although numerical experiments predict that cvs cross the period gap at @xmath48 gyr and reach @xmath34 in @xmath49 gyr after the onset of the mass loss below the gap ( e.g. , @xcite ) , temporal evolution of cvs depends strongly on the mass - loss rate that is not well constrained observationally . to cover a wide range of cv ages ,",
    "we adopt two composite isochrones with 1-gyr and 5-gyr ages ( hereafter b1 and b5 sequences , respectively ) and 1-gyr isochrone for @xmath50 . the choice of the 1-gy isochrone in @xcite was to represent the numerical results of @xcite . ] .",
    "figure [ pic_m_r ] plots the composite @xmath51 of single stars as functions of @xmath30 for the b1 and b5 sequences , as dashed and solid lines , respectively .",
    "both sequences give almost the same radii above @xmath52 , while below this point the stellar radii in the b1 sequence are about @xmath36 larger than in the b5 sequence .    as the mrr of cv secondaries ,",
    "we take the relation derived by @xcite from the observed properties of superhumping cvs : @xmath53 this empirical fit assumes @xmath43 and incorporates itself the additional empirical constraints that reproduce the observed locations of the period gap and the period minimum , such that @xmath16 occurs at @xmath54 and @xmath37 at @xmath55 .",
    "the intrinsic errors in @xmath25 for this empirical mrr are estimated to be about @xmath40@xmath56 @xcite ; we take allowance for @xmath57 uncertainties in @xmath25 throughout this work .",
    "we note a caveat that our choice of the errors may underestimate real values below @xmath52 where only a few systems are observed and thus there is practically no calibrator .",
    "in addition , the masses of wds may differ from the assumed mass of @xmath58 , which also can change @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_kn_mr_fit ] ) is plotted in figure [ pic_m_r ] as dotted line with the shaded region denoting the associated uncertainties in @xmath25 .",
    "columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in table [ ta_seq ] give the @xmath30-@xmath25 relation .",
    "for comparison , figure [ pic_m_r ] also plots as a dot - dashed line the mrr of cvs with @xmath59 from the numerical models of @xcite , which clearly has smaller radii than the empirical relation , typically by @xmath28@xmath60 .",
    "this indicates that the deviation of real donors from thermal equilibrium is larger than that expected from the numerical models .",
    "we define the bloating factor @xmath61 as the relative size of a cv secondary to a single star with the same mass .",
    "figure [ pic_m_al ] plots @xmath62 as dashed and solid lines for the b1 and b5 sequences , respectively , with the shaded and hatched regions representing the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "the discontinuity of @xmath62 at @xmath63 corresponds to the period gap . since @xmath64 ( see below ) , the ratio of the bloating factors above ( @xmath65 ) and below ( @xmath66 ) the gap satisfies @xmath67 , in good agreement with the width of the gap . at the upper edge of the gap ,",
    "the donors detach from their critical lobes and the mass loss stops .",
    "since the donors are thought to be oversized due to the mass loss , they shrink within the gap . when the donors come out the lower edge of the gap , they resume the mass loss and become oversized again .",
    "figure [ pic_m_al ] shows that the bloating factor increases with the decreasing donor mass for @xmath68 and then decreases with decreasing @xmath30 below this point .",
    "this can be explained qualitatively as follows .",
    "since stars with @xmath69 are fully convective and isentropic , they are well described by polytropes with index @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the mrr for these polytropes @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the pressure constant @xcite , then gives @xmath73 the mass loss is capable of driving the donor out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this raises the gravothermal luminosity , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the nuclear luminosity of the donor and @xmath76 is the surface luminosity . for fully convective stars ,",
    "the change of @xmath72 depends on @xmath77 and @xmath20 as @xmath78 @xcite . combining equations",
    "( [ eq_r_m_polytrope ] ) , ( [ eq_alpha_def_k ] ) , and ( [ eq_dk_k ] ) , one obtains @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mass - radius exponent of unperturbed , singe stars . at the lower edge of the period gap , a donor remains close to thermal equilibrium so that @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in this case , the second term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq_da_a ] ) dominates and @xmath83 , indicating that @xmath62 increases as the mass loss continues .",
    "when the donor reaches the minimum hydrogen burning mass ( mhbm ) @xmath84 , the nuclear burning stops and donors are born as brown dwarfs , so that @xmath85 . in the brown dwarf regime , on the other hand , the internal pressure is dominated by the degeneracy pressure with @xmath72 depending mainly on the chemical composition @xcite . in this case , @xmath80 tends to @xmath86 and the first term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq_da_a ] ) dominates , resulting in @xmath87 . for brown - dwarf donors ,",
    "the change in the equation of state partially compensates for the increasing tendency of the bloating factor due to the mass loss .",
    "in addition to the mass loss , tidal and rotational perturbations can also change the donor size , depending on the polytropic index and the mass ratio .",
    "we assume that the applied perturbations do not change the specific entropy , which is reasonable since the stellar distortions occur in dynamical timescales . in appendix",
    "[ ap_isentropic ] , we calculate the enlargement factor @xmath88 of a roche - lobe filling donor as a function of @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "the resulting @xmath88 for @xmath70 polytropes against @xmath30 is plotted in figure [ pic_m_al ] as a dotted line .",
    "note that the expansion of low - mass donors due to the tidal and rotational distortions is @xmath49@xmath91 , insensitive to the mass ratio for @xmath92@xmath93 ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen that while @xmath88 is , in general , considerably smaller than the observed bloating factor for stars with @xmath94 , it is comparable to @xmath62 when @xmath95 corresponding to @xmath16 or when @xmath96 as donors approach @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that the effect of the isentropic expansion of donors on the bloating factor is non - negligible for cvs that just resume mass loss or are below the minimum period .      for a given mrr",
    ", the orbital period can be determined by the roche lobe geometry and kepler s law as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mean density of the donor , @xmath99 is the relative size of the donor to the orbital separation , and @xmath100 is the mass ratio ( e.g. , @xcite ) . equation ( [ eq_mean_den_law ] ) implies that the orbital period depends on the bloating of the donor as @xmath101 clearly , the orbital period increases with the radius of a secondary .",
    "since donors below the period gap are fully convective , their luminosities are determined by the conditions at the very outermost layers @xcite , so that one can neglect the influence of the distortions on the central parts of a donor . to obtain the properties of the photospheric layers , we use the standard hayashi theory . for the opacity law of the form",
    "@xmath102 with the gas pressure @xmath103 , the ratio of the effective temperatures satisfies @xmath104 where @xmath105 ( e.g , @xcite , see also @xcite ) . for the realistic opacity laws applicable for low - mass main - sequence stars",

    "therefore , donors in short - period cvs have approximately the same effective temperatures as the corresponding isolated single stars of identical masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to construct the semi - empirical @xmath1@xmath0 relations , we first use the theoretical @xmath30@xmath114 relation for isolated stars and calculate @xmath115 from equation ( [ eq_mean_den_law ] ) by fixing @xmath43 .",

    "combining equation ( [ eq_te_cor_kw ] ) with the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath126 where @xmath127 is stefan - boltzmann constant , one can show that the change in the stellar luminosity is given by @xmath128 although the effective temperature does not change much with the bloating factor , the additional @xmath129 term in the stefan - boltzmann law increases @xmath130 significantly .",

    "@xcite presented a simple analytical model in which the mass transfer from a donor is treated as a stationary isothermal , subsonic flow of gas through the inner lagrangian point .",

    "note that we neglect the nuclear - timescale term in equation ( [ eq_dm_ritter ] ) since it is much longer than the other timescales involved . in the case of dne",
    "for which the mass transfer is non - conservative , @xmath179 is given by @xmath180 @xcite . if the gravitational wave emission is the dominant mechanism for the shrinkage of the orbital radius , @xmath178 can be set equal to @xmath181 defined as @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "we use the empirical mrr of @xcite and solve equation ( [ eq_dm_ritter ] ) with @xmath183 for @xmath184 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1@xmath184 relations are plotted in figure [ pic_dm_p ] as dashed and solid lines in green color for the b1 and b5 sequences . respectively .",
    "the adopted stellar ages make a small difference in @xmath184 , since the first term in the square brackets of equation ( [ eq_dm_ritter ] ) is insensitive to the isochrones when @xmath185 mhbm , while it becomes much smaller than the second term when @xmath186 mhbm .",
    "figure [ pic_dm_p ] shows that @xmath184 agrees , within errorbars , with @xmath2 for both b1 and b5 sequences before reaching the minimum period .",
    "this verifies that our semi - empirical mass - loss rate is consistent with the angular momentum loss due to emission of gravitational waves , at least for pre - bouncers .",
    "beyond @xmath37 , @xmath2 for the b1 sequence appears to match @xmath184 better than the b5 sequence , suggesting that the cv ages are presumably less than 5 gyr .",
    "since the mass - loss rate can not be observed directly , we are only able to compare our semi - empirical results with the accretion rates estimated by means of other indicators . for this purpose ,",
    "we select 10 short - period , eclipsing cvs from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "table [ ta_ecl ] represents a compilation of our sample cvs , with the parameters in columns ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) taken from the referred papers . to our knowledge , these are the only eclipsers with @xmath1 below 130 min , for which the reliable data for the binary parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath42 , @xmath30 , and @xmath9 are all available . to infer the mass - accretion rates for the sample cvs , we use",
    "@xmath187 where @xmath9 and @xmath42 are the effective temperature and mass of a wd and @xmath188 is the time - averaged accretion rate , taken from @xcite .",
    "since the gravitational energy released by the accreted material onto the surface of a wd is deposited at shallow depths and soon radiated away , the quiescent surface luminosity should be proportional to the mass - accretion rate , leading to @xmath189 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "filled circles with errorbars in figure [ pic_dm_te_ecl]_a _ plot @xmath188 for the sample cvs calculated from equation ( [ eq_town_2009 ] ) ; these are also listed in column ( 8) of table [ ta_ecl ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath188 is broadly in line with our semi - empirical @xmath2 for both b1 and b5 sequence .",
    "this suggests that our semi - empirical @xmath1@xmath2 relation is realistic , provided that @xmath190 in these cvs during accretion disk quiescence .",
    "@xcite noted that @xmath188 significantly declines towards @xmath37 for @xmath191 min . since the accretion rate decreases with decreasing @xmath2 , this downward tendency of @xmath188 with @xmath1 is in agreement with the behavior of the semi - empirical @xmath2 .",
    "donors in short - period cvs are very faint objects , making it difficult to measure their effective temperatures @xmath0 directly from observations , especially in the brown dwarfs regime : in our sample , only two systems ( ht cas and dv uma ) have measured @xmath0 available in the @xcite catalogue",
    ". one way to estimate @xmath0 is to use the strong dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath0 . assuming that @xmath190 during the quiescence phase of dne , we combine equations ( [ eq_dm_def ] ) and ( [ eq_town_2009 ] ) to derive @xmath192 since donors with mass below the mhbm have @xmath85",
    ", @xmath193 depends only on the orbital period and the effective mass - radius exponent . for masses above the mhbm , on the other hand , an accurate estimation of @xmath0 requires to consider the effect of @xmath194 term , which can not be determined observationally .    using the method described in ",
    "[ ssec_lg ] , we calculate @xmath195 for the sample cvs listed in table [ ta_ecl ] . for this , we take @xmath196 for systems with @xmath197 and @xmath198 for @xmath199 in accordance with the adopted empirical mrr .",
    "the bloating factor of each system is calculated relative to the 1-gyr isochrone .",
    "we then calculate @xmath0 from equation ( [ eq_t1_t2 ] ) and plot the results in figure [ pic_dm_te_ecl]_b _ as filled circles with errorbars ; these are also tabulated in column ( 9 ) in table [ ta_ecl ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the estimated effective temperatures , except for sdss 1507 and dv uma , are very close to the semi - empirical @xmath1@xmath0 relation , suggesting that equation ( [ eq_t1_t2 ] ) is in fact a good way to estimate @xmath0 when it can not be measured observationally .",
    "a small orbital period of sdss 1507 implies that this system is most likely formed directly from a wd / brown dwarf pair @xcite or a member of the old halo @xcite , rather than a conventional dn . in the case of dv uma , @xmath200 k calculated from equation ( [ eq_t1_t2 ] ) is @xmath201 smaller than the observed effective temperature @xmath202 k , corresponding to a spectral type of m4.5@xmath203 , from the @xcite catalogue .",
    "such a big difference in @xmath0 can not be due to ambiguity in @xmath204 or @xmath194 terms since both are close to unity for this object .",
    "@xcite noted that the best - constrained quantity from a measured @xmath9 is the accretion rate per unit area , @xmath205 , while the subsequent estimation of @xmath188 from @xmath206 requires a certain mrr of wds , which is poorly known for cvs .",
    "the wd mass in dv uma is highest among the sample , and it is highly probable that the mrr for massive wds differs from @xmath207 adopted by @xcite .    based on the donor masses , @xcite claimed that sdss 1035 , sdss 1501 , sdss 1507 , and sdss 1433 possess post - period minimum cvs .",
    "although period bouncers should have low @xmath30 , the precise mass of a particular secondary does not signify its evolutionary history or status @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary status of such objects can be clarified more clearly by their positions , for instance , on the @xmath1@xmath0 or @xmath1@xmath2 diagram where the boomerang effect can be seen .",
    "figure [ pic_dm_te_ecl ] suggests that sdss 1501 and sdss 1433 among the sample of @xcite have not reached @xmath37 yet .",
    "this result does not depend on the stellar age , since these have @xmath208 for which the semi - empirical mass - loss rate is insensitive to the adopted isochrone .",
    "while the evolutionary status of sdss 1035 is unclear , the fact that the @xmath1@xmath2 dependence for the b1 sequence reconciles well with that due to gravitational wave emission indicates that it is likely a post - bounce cv .",
    "@xcite argued that the tidal and the rotational distortions do not change the value of @xmath34 appreciably because the internal structure of cv secondaries is only weakly affected by such perturbations . to show this , they compared the effective temperatures of the distorted and undistorted stars and found almost no change in @xmath0 .",
    "this result is totally expected since short - period cvs are fully convective stars . as we showed in  [ ssec_te ]",
    ", the hayashi theory gives that the reaction of @xmath0 on the bloating of a donor is small for isolated , fully convective stars .",
    "we also show in appendix [ ap_hayashi_mod ] that the influence of an isentropic expansion on @xmath0 caused by tidal and rotational distortions can be neglected in most practical cases .",
    "all of these suggest that the effective temperature does not reliably measure the amount of the stellar bloating , and consequently can not be used as an indicator of the degree of tidal and rotational distortions .",
    "the mass - loss rate of donors is one of the most important parameters that govern the evolution of short - period cvs . since the mass - loss rate is not directly observable , most previous work employed either purely numerical methods or semi - empirical approaches that use the observed properties of cv accretors rather than donors .",
    "yet , the confirmation of the resulting mass - loss rates has to be made . in this work ,",
    "we use the empirical mrr of short - period cvs constructed by @xcite as an input parameter and derive the semi - empirical relationship between the orbital period and mass - loss rate .",
    "we assume that the bloating of cv donors is caused mainly by the mass loss and associated thermal relaxation processes .",
    "we also calculate the responses of the effective temperature and luminosities on the bloating of the cv secondaries .",
    "we discuss our semi - empirical mass - loss rate in comparison with those from the previous numerical and semi - empirical studies , and in terms of estimating the effective temperature of the donors .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .",
    "the semi - empirical @xmath1@xmath2 dependence shows that the mass - loss rate is essentially non - stationary . for @xmath6 min ,",
    "@xmath2 is in the range of @xmath209@xmath160 and decreases with decreasing @xmath1 relatively slowly as @xmath161 .",
    "below 90 minutes , on the other hand , @xmath2 sharply declines towards @xmath37 as a result of a strong dependence of @xmath2 upon @xmath0 , emulating the @xmath1@xmath0 relation .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence and amplitudes of the semi - empirical @xmath2 are significantly different from those predicted by the purely numerical models of @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the discrepancies is small donor radii in the latter .",
    "donors in short - period cvs are out of thermal equilibrium with @xmath164 .",
    "thermal relaxation processes change the slope of the @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath1@xmath0 diagrams significantly above @xmath37 , making the boomerang shape less pronounced . due to the sharp decline of @xmath0 and @xmath2 below 90 min ,",
    "the observational detection of the boomerang shape on the @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath1@xmath0 is highly unlikely .",
    "the semi - empirical @xmath1@xmath2 relation on the basis of the 1-gyr isochrone is consistent with that estimated from the mass - transfer model of @xcite with the angular momentum carried dominantly by gravitational waves .",
    "our semi - empirical @xmath1@xmath2 relation predicts that after emerging from the period gap , donors lose mass from @xmath167 to @xmath52 in @xmath48 gyr , and reach the minimum period in @xmath482 gyrs , suggesting that the ages of cv secondaries with @xmath210 are less than 2 gyrs .",
