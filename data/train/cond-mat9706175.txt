    "this is related to the fact that orbital ordering is usually needed for a ferromagnetic interaction to occur .",
    "one prominent example are the cuf@xmath0-planes of k@xmath0cuf@xmath1 , where the jahn - teller effect causes orbital order , of alternating @xmath35 and @xmath36 hole orbitals , which completely suppresses the usually dominant anti - ferromagnetic interaction .",

    "the application of these results to rb@xmath0crcl@xmath1 and the cr tri - halides is discussed in section iii .    throughout the paper we will adopt the hole picture since the ligands usually are anions with a filled p shell .",
    "in perturbation theory the coupling between the total spins @xmath25 and @xmath26 of two magnetic ions results from the exchange of the spins in the singly occupied orbitals . since we do not consider spin - dependent interactions like spin - orbit coupling in ( [ hubbard ] ) , the spin hamiltonian is isotropic and in the lowest order we get @xmath44 here , @xmath30 and @xmath32 denote the half - filled orbitals at the sites 1 and 2 . assuming a strong hund interaction , the ground - state has maximum spin and the replacement @xmath45 appears to be justified",

    "<S> using a rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation expansion of multi - band hubbard models , we present analytic expressions for the super - exchange coupling constants between magnetic transition metal ions of arbitrary separation in mott - hubbard insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the only restrictions are i ) all ligand ions are closed shell anions and ii ) all contributing interaction paths are of equal length . for short paths , </S>",
    "<S> our results essentially confirm the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules , yet in general there does not exist any simple rule to predict the sign of the magnetic coupling constants . the most favorable situation for ferromagnetic coupling </S>",
    "<S> is found for ions with less than half filled d shells , the ( relative ) tendency to ferromagnetic coupling increases with increasing path length . as an application , the magnetic interactions of the cr compounds rb@xmath0crcl@xmath1 , crcl@xmath2 , crbr@xmath2 and cri@xmath2 are investigated , all of which except crcl@xmath2 are ferromagnets .    2 </S>"
