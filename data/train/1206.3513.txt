    "the lhc is rapidly extending our knowledge of the tev scale .",
    "as there are currently no signs of new physics , models beyond the standard model ( sm ) have begun to be severely constrained .",
    "one of the most popular model classes is that of supersymmetric extensions , in particular the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . as the mssm itself has over 100 free parameters ,",
    "mainly models with a smaller set of parameters , like the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) with five parameters @xcite , are studied .",
    "this model has been fitted to various combinations of experimental data : see _ e.g_.@xcite , indicating that gluinos and squarks have masses in the multi - tev range .",
    "in particular , if one wants to explain the recent hints of a sm - like higgs boson with mass of 125  gev @xcite , the cmssm becomes more and more unlikely @xcite .",
    "however , this is mainly due to the strong correlations between the various masses of the supersymmetric particles .",
    "once these are given up , a light susy spectrum is still compatible with lhc data as discussed in @xcite .    in the framework of constrained models ,",
    "a way out of this tension is to consider extended models such as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that even in the constrained nmssm a higgs mass of 125  gev can be explained @xcite and in the generalized nmssm these masses are obtained with even less fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is to consider models with extended gauge structures , since then the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson is also relaxed due to additional tree - level contributions @xcite .",
    "such models arise naturally in the context of embedding the sm gauge group in a larger group such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 : see _",
    "e.g_. @xcite , which can also nicely explain neutrino data via the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that such models can have a @xmath1 with a mass in the tev range @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 searches are therefore among the targets of the tevatron and lhc collaborations and bounds on its mass have been set @xcite .",
    "these bounds depend on the concrete gauge group and the couplings of the @xmath1 to the sm fermions : see _ e.g_.@xcite . for reviews on various @xmath1 models see _ e.g_.@xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time that decays into supersymmetric particles can also strongly impact the phenomenology of the @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the lhc phenomenology of supersymmetric @xmath5 extensions has been discussed in the context of @xmath3 and @xmath4 embeddings in @xcite and in a more general class of models with a @xmath6 in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a @xmath0 extension of the mssm is also discussed .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that sleptons , charginos , and neutralinos can be directly produced via a heavy @xmath1 at the lhc even if they have masses of hundreds of gev .",
    "@xmath5 extensions of the sm have a peculiar feature , namely , gauge kinetic mixing @xcite . in the previous studies",
    "either it has been argued that these effects are small or they have been completely ignored .",
    "however , it has also been pointed out in @xcite that gauge kinetic mixing can be important in @xmath1 searches in the case of @xmath4 embeddings .",
    "moreover , it has recently been shown that gauge kinetic mixing is important for the spectrum in @xmath0 extensions of the mssm @xcite .",
    "such models can be embedded , for example , in a string - inspired @xmath7 gauge group @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will explicitly show how existing collider bounds on the @xmath1 mass are changed once gauge kinetic mixing is taken into account .",
    "we find that this can reduce the bounds by about 200  gev , as the couplings of @xmath1 to the sm fermions depend on this mixing .",
    "this clearly affects also the cross section for susy particles produced via a @xmath1 .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate , lhc with @xmath8 tev and a luminosity of 100 fb@xmath2 should be able to discover sleptons via a @xmath1 with slepton masses up to 800  gev , provided the @xmath1 is not much heavier than 2.8  tev . in the case of 300 fb@xmath2",
    ", this extends to slepton masses of about 900  gev up to @xmath1 masses of 3.1  tev .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly summarize the main features of the model and its particle content .",
    "sec : results ] we first discuss how gauge kinetic mixing as well as supersymmetric final states affect the @xmath1 phenomenology in the context of constrained models . afterwards we discuss the possibilities of the lhc to discover susy particles , in particular charged sleptons , via a @xmath1 . here",
    "we will depart from the universality assumption as this mainly depends on the slepton and @xmath1 masses .",
    "finally we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . in the appendix",
    "we give the couplings of the @xmath1 to the scalars and fermions , including terms arising due to gauge kinetic mixing effects .",
    "in this section we discuss briefly the particle content and the superpotential of the model under consideration and we give the tree - level masses and mixings of the particles important to our studies . for a detailed discussion of the masses of all particles as well as of the corresponding one - loop corrections ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "in addition , we recall the main aspects of @xmath5 kinetic mixing since it has important consequences for the phenomenology of the @xmath1 within this model .",
    "the model consists of three generations of matter particles including right - handed neutrinos which can , for example , be embedded in @xmath3 16-plets @xcite .",
    "moreover , below the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale the usual mssm higgs doublets are present , as well as two fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 responsible for the breaking of the @xmath0 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of @xmath9 induces a majorana mass term for the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "thus we interpret the @xmath11charge of this field as its lepton number , and likewise for @xmath10 , and call these fields bileptons since they carry twice the usual lepton number .",

    "as they do not give direct bounds for our model , we have calculated the corresponding signal cross section .",
    "if one took only final states containing sm particles into account and neglected gauge kinetic mixing , one would find a lower bound of @xmath14 . taking into account gauge kinetic mixing we find for @xmath15 a bound of 1790  gev .",
    "moreover , for both our study points , final states containing supersymmetric particles are also present as discussed above .",
    "this leads to an increase of the width and thus to a reduction of the signal cross sections . therefore the bounds are less severe , as has also been discussed in the context of related models @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we encounter here a case where neglecting gauge kinetic effects would lead to a significantly incorrect bound .",
    "in fact the bound obtained at lhc differs by about 200  gev depending on whether kinetic mixing is correctly taken into account or not , as can be seen from table  [ tab : bounds_table ] .",
    "this is further exemplified in fig .",

    ", one sees that the dependence on the gauge kinetic mixing on the susy final states depends on the underlying soft susy - breaking parameters . for blvi",
    ", the dominant susy channels always involve the sleptons and therefore kinetic mixing reduces the cross section .",
    "in contrast , for blv and small values of @xmath16 , final states including two neutralinos with large bileptino contents are important .",

    "in contrast to the previous studies , gauge kinetic mixing is important as we have seen above . in the following we will first take benchmark point blvi to discuss some basic features .",
    "much as in the mssm , the @xmath27 sleptons decay almost always into a lepton and the lightest neutralino , whereas the @xmath28 sleptons decay dominantly into the lighter chargino and a neutrino , or the second lightest neutralino and a lepton , in roughly the ratio two to one .",

    "we have performed a basic monte carlo study using whizard @xcite to generate the signal in the case of smuon pair production and simulated the background .",
    "for the background , we considered diboson production , triple vector boson production and @xmath32 production as well as neutralino and chargino production including both direct production via drell - yan processes and cascade decays from squarks and gluinos .",

    "<S> this model can be embedded in an msugra - inspired model where the mass parameters of the scalars and gauginos unify at the scale of grand unification . in this class of models the renormalization group equation evolution of gauge couplings as well as of the soft susy - breaking parameters </S>",
    "<S> require the proper treatment of gauge kinetic mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that this has a profound impact on the phenomenolgy of the @xmath1 and as a consequence the current lhc bounds on its mass are reduced significantly from about 1970 gev to 1790 gev . </S>",
    "<S> they are even further reduced if the @xmath1 can decay into supersymmetric particles . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we show that in this way sleptons can be produced at the lhc in the 14 tev phase with masses of several hundred gev . in the case of squark and gluino masses in the multi - tev range </S>",
