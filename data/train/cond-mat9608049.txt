    "this appendix is in two parts . in the first part we are going to develop some of the mathematical structures underlying the coherent state path integral for the super spin hamiltonian . in the second part we will derive the expression ( [ h_gamma ] ) for the effective zero mode hamiltonian @xmath358 , which results from treating the background potential by second - order perturbation theory .",
    "our first item will be to discuss the group of canonical transformations of the bose and fermi operators .",
    "for that purpose we introduce a more economical notation , by setting @xmath425 now let @xmath426 , @xmath427 , @xmath428 and @xmath95 be complex @xmath429 supermatrices , i.e. @xmath430 where @xmath431 and @xmath432 are complex numbers , while @xmath433 and @xmath434 are grassmann numbers .",
    "consider then the transformation @xmath435 where the superscript @xmath436 indexes the chiral modes and , here and below , the summation convention is used . by setting @xmath437 , we write this in the abbreviated form @xmath438 if @xmath439 has an inverse , we can also transform the annihilators , by @xmath440 when rearranging products , we follow the convention that grassmann numbers not only anticommute among themselves , but also anticommute with the fermionic operators .",
    "it is then easy to see that the transformation @xmath441 , @xmath442 , is canonical , i.e. preserves the graded commutator .",
    "canonical transformations have an inverse , and a succession of two canonical transformations is again canonical .",
    "therefore such transformations@xcite form a group , which in the present context is the lie supergroup @xmath443 , obtained by complexifying @xmath218 .",
    "the elements @xmath439 of @xmath443 can be written in the form of a gauss decomposition , @xmath444 where , from an easy calculation , @xmath445    every canonical transformation @xmath439 can be realized by a fock space operator @xmath446 that is obtained by exponentiating some bilinear @xmath447 , and acts by @xmath448 , @xmath449 . in detail",
    "the correspondences are as follows : @xmath450 by construction , the correspondence @xmath451 defines a representation of @xmath443 on fock space .",
    "therefore every relation that is valid for supermatrices @xmath439 , and uses no more than the lie supergroup structure of @xmath443 , also holds for the fock space operators @xmath446 .",
    "in particular , by applying the gauss decomposition to the product @xmath452 we get @xmath453_{ab}^{\\vphantom{n } }           c_{b \\downarrow}^n \\right )          \\nonumber \\\\          & & \\times \\exp \\left ( \\overline{c}_{a\\downarrow}^n           [ \\ln ( 1+\\tilde z z)]_{ab}^{\\vphantom{n } } c_{b\\downarrow}^n           - \\overline{c}_{a\\uparrow}^n [ \\ln ( 1+z\\tilde z)]_{ab}^{\\vphantom{n } }           c_{b\\uparrow}^n \\right )          \\nonumber \\\\          & & \\times \\exp \\left ( \\overline{c}_{a\\downarrow}^n           [ \\tilde z ( 1+z\\tilde z)^{-1}]_{ab}^{\\vphantom{n } }           c_{b\\uparrow}^n \\right ) , \\nonumber          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is called a `` disentangling '' identity , since it moves the @xmath443 lowering operators all the way to the right , and the raising operators all the way to the left .",
    "consider now the generalized coherent states@xcite @xmath454 the superdeterminant of a @xmath429 supermatrix , @xmath455 satisfies @xmath456 , where @xmath457 , with @xmath458 if @xmath459 ( boson ) and @xmath460 if @xmath461 ( fermion ) , is the supertrace .",
    "using this , the disentangling identity , and the relations @xmath462 it is easy to check that the generalized coherent states are normalized , @xmath463 another useful way of writing the generalized coherent states is @xmath464 where @xmath465 and @xmath466    the zero energy multiplet of sec .",
    "[ sec : zero_energy ] coincides with the space of states obtained by acting repeatedly with the @xmath443 raising operators @xmath467 on the vacuum @xmath299 .",
    "in@xcite it was shown that , if @xmath468 is the uniform superintegration measure on the supermanifold @xmath469 parameterized by the coherent states @xmath470 , the unit operator on the zero energy multiplet can be resolved by @xmath471 ( note that the conventions of that reference differ from ours by @xmath472 and the exchange of the fermionic and bosonic sectors . )",
    "the integral is over @xmath473 with the integration domain being @xmath474 these relations mean@xcite that the variable @xmath475 is a complex stereographic coordinate for the two - sphere @xmath476 ( as is well - known for su(2 ) coherent states ) while @xmath477 parameterizes a two - hyperboloid @xmath478 ( as is appropriate for the non - compact group su(1,1 ) ) .",
    "of course @xmath479 , @xmath480 , @xmath481 , and @xmath482 are grassmann variables .    given the resolution of unity ( [ identity ] ) , we can convert supertraces over the zero energy multiplet into integrals over the generalized coherent states : @xmath483 the coherent state path integral for the partition function of a super spin system with hamiltonian @xmath42 , is now obtained in the usual manner by inserting resolutions of unity between infinitesimal imaginary time slices of the boltzmann weight @xmath157 .",
    "the lagrangian of the resulting path integral is @xmath484 , whose explicit form is easily calculated by using the definition of the coherent states and the disentangling identity .",
    "for example , @xmath485 .",
    "\\nonumber          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the wess - zumino ( or linear in @xmath486 ) term in ( [ single_spin_lagrangian_z ] ) is obtained on setting the number of chiral modes @xmath3 equal to one and omitting a total @xmath40 derivative .    below we will need an explicit expression for the coherent state expectation value of the operator @xmath384 appearing in the formula ( [ h_gamma ] ) of @xmath358 . to calculate it we write @xmath487",
    "the second equality is invalid for both @xmath488 and @xmath489 , since @xmath490 and @xmath491 , but it does hold in the present case as a result of cancellations due to supersymmetry . using the second form of @xmath384 we easily find @xmath492 which yields @xmath493          + { \\cal o}(n^1 ) .",

    "the first step is to construct the projector on the space of momentum-@xmath177 single magnon excitations , @xmath360 .",
    "magnons can be created on top of the vacuum or any other state of the zero energy multiplet .",
    "we define the single magnon creation and annihilation operators by @xmath495 and consider the states @xmath496 the corresponding projection operator is @xmath497 it is easy to verify that , with the normalization and sign factors chosen , @xmath498 satisfies @xmath499 , and is a singlet with respect to the ( complexified ) algebra @xmath500 generated by the zero mode operators @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath501 , @xmath502 , @xmath503 , and @xmath504 . the states",
    "@xmath505 are single magnon excitations built on the vacuum .",
    "other one - magnon states ( not based on the vacuum ) are generated by applying a global rotation , @xmath506 the projector @xmath498 transforms as @xmath507 the projector on the entire one - magnon sector is obtained by averaging over all global rotations , @xmath508 the integrand is well - defined as a function on the coset space @xmath509 since , by the @xmath271-singlet property of @xmath498 , @xmath510 for @xmath511 .    to go further ,",
    "we need to take advantage of the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "let us evaluate the expectation value of @xmath512 in a coherent state @xmath513 , @xmath514 for large @xmath3 we expect the dominant contributions to the @xmath515 integral to come from the immediate vicinity of @xmath516 , so we substitute variables @xmath517 ( with @xmath518 subject to the transversality condition @xmath519 ) and approximate @xmath520 by its linearization @xmath521 at @xmath439 .",
    "the integration over @xmath518 is trivial since @xmath522 reduces to a @xmath523-function in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "thus , doing the @xmath515 integral to leading order in the large parameter @xmath3 , we get @xmath524 the large-@xmath3 limit is semiclassical in nature , and it is not hard to see that all off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath358 become negligible for @xmath525 . therefore",
