    "amorphous silicon ( @xmath2-si ) inevitably contains dangling bonds which lead to electronically active defect states in the band gap . for undoped material",
    ", most dangling - bond states are singly occupied , and their spins provide a well defined experimental signature .",
    "the fermi level is controlled by the energy of the gap states .",
    "hydrogenation of @xmath2-si reduces the density of defect gap states by passivating the dangling bonds and thus restores the band gap , making hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( @xmath2-si : h ) applicable to solar cell devices.@xcite however , even a small density of gap states can degrade performance , and gap states are also connected to degradation of device performance over time . thus understanding the origin and properties of these states",
    "remains an important theoretical challenge .",
    "the earliest theoretical work on defect states in @xmath2-si and @xmath2-si : h was based on tight - binding methods.@xcite biswas et al.@xcite and fedders and carlsson@xcite investigated the electronic structure of dangling and floating bonds in @xmath2-si within tight - binding theory .",
    "they showed that the wave function of the gap defect states associated with the dangling bond is strongly localized on the threefold coordinated atom@xcite and relatively independent of strain@xcite , in contrast to the floating bond defect states .",
    "this difference was taken to imply that the electron - spin resonance ( esr ) signal in @xmath2-si : h arises from dangling bonds . in tight - binding calculations without electron - electron interaction terms ,",
    "the localization of the spin of the gap states is the same as that of the charge density , since the remaining occupied states do not adjust to the electron charge in the dangling - bond gap state .",
    "this leads , in general to an overestimate of the charge density associated with the gap state .",
    "more recently , density - functional calculations of dangling - bond states using the local - density approximation have been performed.@xcite they yield a charge localization of less than 15% on the central atom .",
    "this finding at first appeared to be at variance with esr experiments , which showed that over 50% of the spin density of the energy gap state is located on the central atom of the dangling bond.@xcite however , recent calculations using the local spin - density approximation have shown that the degree of localization of the spin density is quite different from that of the charge density.@xcite the energy cost to localize the charge density is substantially larger than the energy to localize the spin density.@xcite this demonstrates the importance of correlation effects for a correct description of the electronic structure of the dangling bond , since in purely one - electron descriptions the charge and spin densities for a defect orbital are equivalent .    because of these correlation effects , the extent of the applicability of current implementations of density - functional theory to the electronic properties of defects in @xmath2-si : h is not clear .",
    "these implementations break down in the limit of strong correlations .",
    "in addition , current density - functional codes do not provide information on the spin and charge fluctuations at the defect .",
    "for this reason , it is useful to study the defect states with a method that is valid in the limit of strong interactions , and that provides information on electronic fluctuations . in this work",
    "a recently developed method based on density - matrix functional theory , developed for isolated strongly interacting orbitals@xcite , is applied to the problem of a single dangling bond in @xmath2-si : h . so far",
    "this method has only been applied to idealized models . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the method can be used to calculate the electronic structure of a semiquantitatively accurate model such as that treated here .",
    "our results for the charge and spin distributions of the defect states are consistent with earlier results .",
    "we also make predictions for the fluctuations of the spin and charge .",

    "section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] introduces the hamiltonian and describes the density - matrix functional used to calculate the ground state energy of the system .",
    "section  [ sec : danglingbond ] is the core of the paper , presenting our results for the electronic structure of the dangling bond .",
    "the effects of electron correlations on the energy of the defect state in the band gap are determined by comparison of results from the density - matrix functional and the hartree - fock approximation in section  [ sec : interactions ] .",

    "the atomic model for amorphous hydrogenated silicon used here was employed in an earlier density - functional theory calculation.@xcite it contains 122 si atoms and 20 hydrogen atoms per fcc unit cell , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the atomic positions were obtained by doubling a previous , smaller unit cell , and subsequently annealing the structure .",

    "the hydrogen concentration of 14% is somewhat higher than what is commonly used in experimental samples ( @xmath310% ) .",

    "the expectation value of the interaction energy , @xmath22 is rigorously given as a functional of the local moments of the one - body density matrix projected on site 0.@xcite the exact form of this functional is not known .",
    "however , for systems with only two interacting orbitals , such as that studied here , a lower bound for the interaction energy holds which is given in terms of the second moment of the density matrix : @xmath23 a parallel result is obtained by switching up and down spins in the above inequality . in the `` second - moment approximation '' that we employ here , the interaction energy is obtained as a function of @xmath20 by replacing the inequality by an equality if this gives a positive value for the interaction energy ; if not the interaction energy is taken to be zero .",
    "the density matrix of the model system is taken to be that which minimizes the total energy , subject to the constraint that all of its eigenvalues must be between zero and unity .",
    "this approach gives the correct density matrix for an exact density - matrix functional@xcite and is the appropriate avenue to use with our approximate functional .",
    "the resulting density matrix , unlike those obtained from density - functional calculations , has a range of eigenvalues between zero and one and is thus not idempotent ( for @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is the correct behavior for interacting systems .",

    "compared to experimental values of the energy gap of 1.4  ev to 2.0  ev , the tight binding parameterization  @xcite that we use underestimates the gap .",
    "however , the density of states of our model of amorphous hydrogenated silicon compares well to the density of states for larger models such as the ones investigated by holender and morgan using the same tight - binding parameterization  @xcite .    in the single dangling bond electronic - structure calculations ,",

    "the spin rises for small values of @xmath0 and then levels off at a value about 15% higher than the zero-@xmath0 value .",
    "in contrast , the spin in the uhf approximation continues to rise at the highest values of @xmath0 that were treated , and eventually approaches unity .",

    "the uhf approximation overestimates the local moment on the dangling - bond site in order to reduce the interaction energy .",
    "the second - moment approximation , however , does not yield such a large local moment .",

    "in contrast , the uhf results reveal a monotonic decrease of @xmath43 with @xmath0 .",
    "these results are consistent with the anderson - chain results.@xcite the decrease in the spin fluctuation with @xmath0 in the uhf approximation results from the increased moment obtained in this approximation , while the increase observed in the second - moment approximation results from the reduced occupancy of the zero - spin states in which both orbitals on site 0 are empty or filled .",

    "the fluctuations drop with increasing @xmath0 . however , the second - moment approximation yields a more pronounced drop than the uhf approximation .",

    "ev.,width=321 ]      the primary outputs of these calculations that can be compared with experiment and previous theory are the spin and charge localization of the gap states , and their splitting . the components of the gap - state charge density on the sites other than 0 are found by evaluating the changes in site - projected charges when the chemical potential crosses up through the lower gap level .",
