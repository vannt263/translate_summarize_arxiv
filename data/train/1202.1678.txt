    "matrix factorisations are a beautiful mathematical subject in the sense that they are easy to define and still have a lot of interesting structures .",
    "furthermore they can be used and applied in physics , where they describe boundary conditions and defects in @xmath0 supersymmetric landau - ginzburg ( lg ) models ( see e.g.  @xcite for an overview ) .    in the simplest",
    "setting , a matrix factorisation consists of two quadratic matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the same size with polynomial entries whose product is the identity matrix multiplied by a given potential @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 an example of that is given by @xmath5 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are just polynomials ( @xmath6 matrices ) .",
    "this example describes b - type boundary conditions in @xmath0 minimal models  @xcite .",
    "in addition to boundary conditions one can also consider b - type defects between landau - ginzburg models with superpotentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 . they can be described by matrix factorisations of the difference @xmath9",
    "defects are very important and useful objects in two - dimensional field theory : one of their most crucial properties is that they can be fused by bringing them on top of each other to produce a new defect @xcite .",
    "in such a way , defects define an interesting algebraic structure that turns out to be useful in analysing symmetries and dualities ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and bulk and boundary renormalisation group flows ( see e.g.@xcite ) in such models . as defects can also be fused onto boundaries , they may be used to relate or to generate boundary conditions . in particular , if we know defects between different theories , we can generate boundary conditions in one model from boundary conditions in the other model by fusion of the defect .",
    "in this work we will analyse defects between lg models with potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 that are related by a variable transformation .",
    "if these transformations are non - linear , the two physical theories will be different .",
    "we will see that in such a situation there is one natural defect that acts in a simple , but non - trivial way on matrix factorisations .",
    "after analysing its properties we will apply it in a number of examples .",
    "in particular we demonstrate how it can be used to generate matrix factorisations in kazama - suzuki models from those in minimal models .",
    "a b - type defect separating two @xmath0 supersymmetric landau - ginzburg models with superpotentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , can be described by a matrix factorisation of the difference @xmath9 of the potentials @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be polynomial algebras over @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "a @xmath15-defect matrix factorisation is then a pair @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a free , @xmath18 graded @xmath10-@xmath11-bimodule , and @xmath19 is an odd bimodule map , @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . as @xmath22 is assumed to be free , @xmath19 can be written as a matrix with polynomial entries .",
    "a b - type boundary condition is a special defect , for which one side is trivial , e.g.  @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "morphisms between defects @xmath16 and @xmath25 are bimodule maps @xmath26 with @xmath27 modulo exact maps of the form @xmath28 .",
    "matrix factorisations are considered to be equivalent if there exist two morphisms @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 equal the identity map up to exact terms .",
    "consider e.g.  @xmath33 and @xmath34 for an even isomorphism @xmath35 .",
    "these factorisations are then equivalent with the morphisms being @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "when we write the @xmath18 gradation explicitly , the action of @xmath38 on @xmath1 and @xmath2 amounts to similarity transformations , @xmath39    one of the most interesting properties of defects is that they can be fused .",
    "physically this means that two defects can be put on top of each other producing a new defect  @xcite .",
    "mathematically this amounts to define the tensor product  @xcite of two matrix factorisations @xmath16 and @xmath40 . as a module",
    "this is simply the graded tensor product @xmath41 and the associated module map is @xmath42    for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , there is a special defect called the identity defect , which we denote by @xmath45 .",
    "fusing the identity defect onto some defect reproduces the original defect , it serves therefore as a unit object with respect to the tensor product .",
    "its precise construction can be found in  @xcite .    for different superpotentials",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath46 there is in general no natural defect factorisation . on the other hand ,",
    "if there exists a ring homomorphism @xmath47 then we can naturally map @xmath10-modules to @xmath48-modules and vice versa by extension or restriction of scalars : via the homomorphism @xmath49 the ring @xmath48 has a natural @xmath10-@xmath48-bimodule structure , @xmath50 , where the multiplication from the left is defined via the homomorphism @xmath49 . given a right @xmath10-module @xmath51 we can then map it to a right @xmath48-module by @xmath52 which describes the extension of scalars from @xmath10 to @xmath48 . on the other hand",
    ", a left @xmath48-module @xmath53 has a natural @xmath10-module structure using the homomorphism @xmath49 .",
    "this restriction of scalars from @xmath48 to @xmath10 can be written as the map @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 act also on module homomorphisms in an obvious way , so they define functors on the categories of @xmath10- and @xmath48-modules . notice that @xmath55 maps free modules to free modules , whereas this is not guaranteed for @xmath56 .",
    "we assume in the following that the @xmath10-module @xmath57 is free , such that @xmath56 maps free modules to free modules .",
    "we can apply these functors also to matrix factorisations .",
    "in particular we can apply them to the identity factorisations @xmath58 and @xmath59 to obtain two @xmath15-defects with @xmath60 , @xmath61 we now claim that these two defects are actually equivalent . to show this we take the first defect and fuse the identity defect @xmath62 from the right , and compare it to the second defect onto which we fuse the identity defect @xmath63 from the left . as a module we obtain @xmath64 since @xmath65",
    "also the factorisations agree , so that we indeed find that these two defects are equivalent .",
    "we call them @xmath66 .    by a similar consideration as above",
    "we see that when we fuse @xmath66 to the left , it acts by the functor @xmath67 , whereas it acts by the functor @xmath56 when we fuse it to defects to the right .",
    "thus we have a very simple description for the fusion result for this defect .",
    "analogously we can construct the defect @xmath68 .",
    "let us explicitly describe how the defect @xmath66 acts by fusion . first consider the ( simpler ) fusion to the left on a defect @xmath69 . for a rank @xmath70 free @xmath11-@xmath10-bimodule @xmath71 we can think of @xmath19 as a @xmath72 matrix with entries @xmath73 in @xmath74 . fusing @xmath66 onto this defect from the right , we obtain a free @xmath11-@xmath48-module of rank @xmath70 , and a matrix @xmath75 with entries @xmath76 , i.e.  we just replace the variables of @xmath10 by the variables of @xmath48 via the map @xmath49 .",
    "we now assume that @xmath57 is a finite rank free @xmath10-module , @xmath77 with the help of the @xmath10-module isomorphism @xmath78 we can then explicitly describe how the defect @xmath66 acts by fusion to the right on a defect @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath80 is free of rank @xmath70 , then @xmath19 can be represented as a @xmath72 matrix with entries @xmath81 .",
    "after the fusion we have a @xmath10-@xmath82-module of rank @xmath83 , and each entry @xmath73 is replaced by the @xmath84 matrix that represents the map @xmath85 ( where we tacitly extend @xmath78 to mean @xmath86 ) .",
    "a particular situation occurs when all @xmath73 are of the form @xmath87 . as @xmath78 is an @xmath10-module map , the map @xmath88",
    "can then be represented by the @xmath84 matrix @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting defect is therefore a direct sum of @xmath90 identical defects . as an example , consider the fusion of @xmath66 on @xmath68 . by the arguments above this",
    "fusion results in a direct sum of @xmath90 identity defects , @xmath91 in the special case that @xmath49 is a ring isomorphism , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , the construction above leads to symmetry or group - like defects @xmath94 ( which have been discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the fusion of such defects is particularly simple , @xmath95 and @xmath96 is invertible with inverse @xmath97 .",
    "these defects therefore form a group .",
    "in this section we want to apply the formalism of the foregoing section to physically interesting examples .",
    "let us first look at the one variable case , @xmath98 $ ] , and choose the potential to be @xmath99 .",
    "the corresponding landau - ginzburg model describes a minimal model at level @xmath100 .",
    "consider now the ring homomorphism @xmath101 that maps polynomials in @xmath10 to those in @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "the transformed potential is @xmath103 .",
    "we observe that @xmath57 is a free @xmath10-module of rank @xmath104 , @xmath105 let us now look at the corresponding defect between these two minimal models .",
    "we consider the explicit construction @xmath106 via @xmath56 .",
    "we start with the identity defect @xmath59 that is given by a rank @xmath107 matrix @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . here",
    "we denoted by @xmath111 the variable corresponding to the right @xmath48-module structure . under the map",
    "@xmath56 acting on the left @xmath48-module structure the entry @xmath112 is then replaced by @xmath113{\\text{similarity } } \\begin{pmatrix } y - x'^{d } & & & \\\\ & 1 & & \\\\ & & \\ddots & \\\\ & & & 1 \\end{pmatrix } \\ .\\ ] ] we therefore explicitly see that this defect is equivalent to @xmath114 that we obtain from the identity defect in @xmath115-variables by expressing one of the variables in terms of @xmath116 .",
    "this defect is related to the generalised permutation boundary conditions in two minimal models  @xcite by the folding trick .",
    "we now want to apply this defect to matrix factorisations @xmath117 that describe boundary conditions .",
    "the elementary factorisation @xmath118 will be called @xmath119 , and correspondingly @xmath120 refers to the @xmath115-factorisation @xmath121 .",
    "fusing the defect @xmath66 to @xmath122 results in a superposition @xmath123 ( for @xmath124 ) .",
    "the factorisation @xmath125 is trivial , so we see that the basic factorisation @xmath126 is just mapped to the basic factorisation @xmath127 .",
    "we can also consider defects in minimal models .",
    "of particular interest are the group - like defects @xmath128 @xcite that induce the map @xmath129 . here",
    "@xmath130 such that the potential @xmath131 is invariant .",
    "obviously we have @xmath132 , and the group law is just @xmath133 . as a @xmath134-defect matrix factorisation , @xmath128 corresponds to @xmath135 .",
    "similarly , @xmath136 denotes the group - like defect corresponding to the map @xmath137 .",
    "given such a defect @xmath136 one can ask what happens to it when we sandwich it between the defects @xmath138 and @xmath139 . surprisingly the result can again be expressed in terms of group like - defects , namely @xmath140      as a more interesting example we look at a defect between an @xmath141 kazama - suzuki model and a product of two minimal models .",
    "consider the two variable polynomial rings @xmath142 $ ] and @xmath143 $ ] , and the ring homomorphism @xmath144 which replaces the @xmath145 by the elementary symmetric polynomials in the @xmath146 .",
    "the potential in @xmath116-variables is that of two minimal models , @xmath147 it is symmetric in @xmath148 and @xmath149 and thus it can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials leading to the potential @xmath150 in the @xmath115-variables such that @xmath151 .",
    "this then describes the @xmath152 kazama - suzuki model ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath10-module @xmath57 is free of rank @xmath107 with the explicit @xmath10-module isomorphism @xmath153 with inverse @xmath154 where @xmath155 , and @xmath156 means to replace in a symmetric polynomial in @xmath146 the elementary symmetric polynomials by the @xmath145 .",
    "the @xmath15-defect between the kazama - suzuki model ( @xmath115-variables ) and the minimal models ( @xmath116-variables ) acts on @xmath115-factorisations simply by replacing variables .",
    "however , given an @xmath116-factorisation with matrix @xmath19 , a matrix element @xmath73 is replaced by a @xmath157 matrix , @xmath158 as an example consider the boundary condition based on the factorisation @xmath159 with @xmath160 ( these are the so - called permutation factorisations  @xcite ) . by the map   the factor @xmath161",
    "is mapped to @xmath162 \\frac{1+\\xi}{2 } & \\frac{1-\\xi}{2}y_{1 } \\end{pmatrix } \\xrightarrow[\\text{transf.}]{\\text{similarity } }   \\begin{pmatrix } y_{1}^{2}- 2 ( 1+\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{k+2})y_{2 } & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix } \\ , .\\ ] ] this means that the linear polynomial factorisation in @xmath116 is mapped to a polynomial factorisation in the @xmath115-variables .",
    "the interesting fact is now that both factorisations describe rational boundary states in the corresponding conformal field theories  @xcite .",
    "one can go further and consider the @xmath116-factorisation @xmath163 the quadratic factor is mapped to @xmath164{\\text{similarity } } & \\begin{pmatrix } y_{1}^{2}-2 ( 1+\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{k})y_{2 } & 0\\\\ y_{1 } & y_{1}^{2}-2 ( 1+\\cos \\frac{3\\pi}{k})y_{2 } \\end{pmatrix } \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again this factorisation has been identified with a rational boundary condition in the kazama - suzuki model in  @xcite .",
    "this example shows that the variable transformation defect is indeed very useful to generate interesting matrix factorisations . in a subsequent publication",
    "we will show that with the help of this variable transformation defect , one also can generate rational defects in kazama - suzuki models which then allow to generate in principle all factorisations corresponding to rational boundary conditions in these models .",
    "the defect considered here actually also appears in the link homology of khovanov and rozansky  @xcite , namely the diagram on the right in figure  [ fig : krbblocks ] corresponds in our language to the defect @xmath165 ( where @xmath166 $ ] ) .     in @xmath116-variables to the left , and the basic wide - edge graph on the right corresponding to @xmath165 ( with @xmath167}$ ] , @xmath168}$ ] ) . ]",
    "the diagram on the left of figure  [ fig : krbblocks ] simply corresponds to the identity defect in @xmath116-variables .",
    "one of the fundamental equivalences in the link homology displayed in figure  [ fig : krisom ] would read in our notation ( with @xmath169 $ ] ) @xmath170 which follows immediately from  .",
    "it would be very interesting to also consider the morphisms between the defects in figure  [ fig : krbblocks ] that are needed to formulate the complex of defects assigned to crossings ( see  @xcite ) in our framework , but we leave this for future work",
    ".      the last example has a beautiful generalisation to a defect between a @xmath171 kazama - suzuki model and @xmath90 copies of minimal models .",
    "we consider the polynomial rings @xmath172 $ ] and @xmath173 $ ] , and the potential @xmath174 the ring homomorphism is defined by @xmath175 and it maps the @xmath176 to the elementary symmetric polynomials in the @xmath177 .",
    "it is an old result in invariant theory  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* g ) that @xmath57 is a free @xmath10-module of rank @xmath178 . to get an explicit @xmath10-module isomorphism between @xmath57 and @xmath179",
    ", one needs to choose a good basis in @xmath48 .",
    "the simplest choice  @xcite is to take the @xmath178 polynomials given by @xmath180 another possibility with some computational advantages is provided by the schubert polynomials @xmath181 , for which there is one for each permutation @xmath182 in the symmetric group @xmath183 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that any polynomial @xmath184 has a unique expansion @xmath185 where the @xmath186 are totally symmetric .",
    "the map @xmath78 is then given by @xmath187",
    "we have seen that there is a natural defect between landau - ginzburg theories whose superpotentials are related by a variable transformation .",
    "the fusion of this defect onto other factorisations has an explicit and simple description via the functors @xmath55 and @xmath56 corresponding to extension and restriction of scalars .",
    "the examples have shown that these defects can be used to relate boundary conditions or defects in different lg models .",
    "in particular , one can use such defects between minimal models and grassmannian kazama - suzuki models to put into use the knowledge that is already available for minimal models to obtain factorisations for the kazama - suzuki models . in a such a way one",
    "can for example generate all factorisations corresponding to rational boundary conditions in the @xmath152 model , as we will show in a subsequent publication .    in the @xmath152 example it turns out that the defects discussed here are crucial to construct factorisations for rational topological defects .",
    "these finitely many elementary defects and their superpositions form a closed semi - ring that is isomorphic to the fusion semi - ring .",
    "realising such a finite - dimensional semi - ring ( in the sense that as a semi - group it is isomorphic to a direct product of finitely many copies of @xmath188 ) in terms of defect matrix factorisations reflects the rational structure of the conformal field theory that is otherwise hard to see in the lg formulation .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the existence of such an algebraic structure automatically signals an enhanced symmetry in the cft .",
    "finally , we have seen that our defects generate the building blocks of khovanov - rozansky homology , except for the morphisms between defect building blocks . in other words",
    ", one could say that our formulation provides a physical setup of the khovanov - rozansky factorisations as a sequence of kazama - suzuki models separated by defects . by generalisation to @xmath171 models , this is also true for the higher graphs appearing in the moy calculus  @xcite .",
    "our analysis can therefore be seen as a physical supplement to the recent results in  @xcite .",
