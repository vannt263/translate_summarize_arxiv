    "loop quantum gravity @xcite is a proposal for a canonical quantization of general relativity . by a careful use of basic variables suitable for a quantum representation independent of auxiliary metric or causal structures ,",
    "it has shed light on several aspects of the quantum geometry of space .",
    "the dynamics of the theory , however , remains poorly controlled , and therefore it is not clear what structure of quantum space - time it implies .",
    "dynamical operators are subject to quantum ambiguities , and their evaluation is still plagued by long - standing conceptual problems of canonical quantum gravity , most famously the problem of time @xcite .    that much - needed progress especially on the last - mentioned problem is lacking is illustrated for instance by the proliferating use of `` deparameterized '' quantum theories , in which the time variable is fixed once and for all ( as a matter degree of freedom rather than a coordinate ) .",
    "the space - time gauge is partially fixed , even though one set out to derive properties of quantum space - time .",
    "such time - fixed systems have been seriously proposed not just as toy models but even as complete quantum theories of gravity ( see e.g.@xcite ) . with these attempts ,",
    "one no longer aims at gaining control over quantum space - time and its physical effects , for which one would have to show that quantum observables are independent of the choice of time , be it an internal matter clock or a coordinate ; no such results of independence have been provided in deparameterized models .    with problems like these still outstanding , it remains questionable whether the theory can be considered as fundamental .",
    "( of course , this is not to say that the theory could not achieve fundamental status with further , significant progress . ) nevertheless , the theory s results regarding the quantum geometry of space and background independence may still be of physical interest , provided they can manifest themselves in sufficiently characteristic ways on the typical scales of gravitational phenomena , far removed from the microscopic planck scale .",
    "this is the realm of effective theory , a powerful viewpoint in many examples ( not only ) of high - energy phenomena , so also in loop quantum gravity as laid out in this contribution .",
    "the dynamical problems of loop quantum gravity are not specific to this particular approach but have a general origin in relativistic properties of space - time . generally covariant theories , such as general relativity ,",
    "have complicated gauge structures ( coordinate transformations , or hypersurface deformations ) that can best be addressed with canonical techniques .",
    "( for canonical methods in gravity , see @xcite . )",
    "in such settings they show their troubling face most directly , but they also sneak through other approaches , for instance those using path integrals or spin foams where finding the correct integration measure is a related problem .",
    "these issues require special care , new methods of quantum field theory and semiclassical or effective descriptions . here",
    "we present an overview of the following techniques , suitable for physical evaluations of the theory : ( i ) a canonical derivation of effective equations for quantum dynamics , and ( ii ) a discussion of general covariance in quantum gravity and deformed space - time structures . by bringing these parts together , an effective theory of loop quantum gravity",
    "is obtained .",
    "in quantum theory , every local classical degree of freedom , @xmath0 in canonical form , amounts to infinitely many quantum degrees of freedom  expectation values @xmath1 , @xmath2 , fluctuations ( squared ) @xmath3 , and so on with higher powers .",
    "an effective theory , in general terms , aims to describe some properties of quantum theory by interactions of finitely many local degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , if we keep only the expectation values , we have the classical limit .",
    "expectation values together with fluctuations , taking values near saturation of the uncertainty relation , provide the first - order approximation in @xmath4 . the higher the @xmath4-order , the more degrees of freedom must be considered ( related but not identical to higher time derivatives ) . in a formal limit including the order @xmath5 , we are back at quantum theory , but in perturbative guise .",
    "some subtle effects may be missed , for instance different inequivalent self - adjoint extensions of hamiltonians .",
    "but many dynamical properties independent of subtleties can be derived conveniently using effective theory .",
    "one may therefore hope that some of the technical and conceptual problems of quantum gravity or quantum cosmology can be simplified as well , and this hope is indeed borne out .      like most other questions",

    "although they amount to just the classical equations for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , their solutions determine exact quantum properties .",
    "to go beyond the classical order free of @xmath4-dependent terms , we can use the same type of equations of motion to derive dynamical laws for fluctuations @xmath11 of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and , as it turns out to be necessary , the covariance .",
    "these variables provide all degrees of freedom to second order , with expectation values of quadratic functions of the basic operators . in a semiclassical state ,",
    "the values are of the order @xmath4 , as one can verify explicitly for a gaussian .",

    "( most examples use deparameterization without providing a way to test for independence of the choice of time . )",
    "we summarize some of the salient features :    * the system of constraints , if there are more than one , is consistent and first class , provided the ordering @xmath88 is chosen .",
    "( all constraint equations are then left invariant under the flow generated by other constraints , when the constraints hold . )",
    "this ordering is not symmetric .",
    "* as a consequence , the quantum constraint equations are not guaranteed to be real , and neither are their solutions .",
    "indeed , we do not require reality of kinematical moments @xmath89 before the constraints are solved .",
    "instead , we impose reality only after solving the quantum constraints to ensure physical normalization of states .",
    "the transition from complex - valued kinematical moments to real - valued physical ones , solving the constraints , corresponds to the transition from the kinematical hilbert space ignoring the constraints to the physical hilbert space free of gauge degrees of freedom . in this transition ,",
    "the inner product , and therefore physical normalization , usually changes , especially when zero is contained in the continuous part of the spectrum of ( some of ) the constraints .",
    "* different gauge fixings of the system of quantum constraints are related to different kinematical hilbert - space structures .",
    "again , the effective level provides more manageable techniques to describe different choices , with gauge transformations within one quantum phase space instead of unitary transformations between different hilbert spaces .",
    "such gauge transformations have , for instance , been made use of to help solve the problem of time in quantum gravity at least in semiclassical regimes @xcite .",
    "these examples are the only ones in which it was possible to show that physical results in the quantum theory do not depend on one s choice of time .",
    "linear constraints provide the simplest examples , and even show , in spite of their poor physical content , some interesting insights @xcite .",

    "the position fluctuation is pure gauge . to this order , therefore , all variables  expectation values and moments  are eliminated , a pattern that extends to all orders .",
    "another consequence is that the constraint @xmath93 implies a complex - valued kinematical covariance @xmath94 with this solution , the uncertainty relation ( [ uncert ] ) is respected ( and saturated ) even though one of the fluctuations vanishes . in this way",
    ", the complex - valuedness of kinematical moments leads to overall consistency . in the present example",
    ", no degree of freedom is left after all constraints have been solved , and no reality conditions need be imposed .",
    "if there are additional , unconstrained degrees of freedom , they can be restricted to be real , as observables corresponding to expectation values and moments computed in the physical hilbert space .",
    "the techniques of the previous section provide the basis for an effective theory of loop quantum gravity or , more generally , canonical quantum gravity . in theories of gravity",
    ", we have several non - linear constraints with a complicated algebra .",
    "moreover , the constraints include the dynamics by a hamiltonian constraint and are therefore the most important part of those theories .",
    "unfortunately , no fully consistent quantization is known .",
    "effective techniques again come in handy because they allow more manageable calculations perturbative in @xmath4 ( or other expansions ) .",
    "this is sufficient for the derivation of potentially observable phenomena .",
    "moreover , by analyzing quantum corrections to the constraints and their algebra ( which classically exhibits the gauge structure of coordinate transformations ) one can shed light on modified space - time structures and even address fundamental questions .    in the context of quantum gravity , the role of higher time derivatives , alluded to before",
    ", becomes important .",
    "to recall , at adiabatic orders higher than second , solutions for moments depend on higher time derivatives of @xmath1 . higher - derivative effective actions then result",
    ". such terms are exactly what we expect in quantum gravity and cosmology , where higher derivatives are part of higher - curvature terms .",
    "non - effective calculations directly in hilbert spaces , on the other hand , have difficulties making a connection with higher time derivatives .    even in an effective setting , the correspondence is not entirely obvious , an issue that once again is related to the question of general covariance .",
    "effective equations depend on the quantum state used , via initial values for moment equations @xmath95 .",
    "there is no gravitational hamiltonian bounded from below , and therefore no obvious ground state one might choose for an effective description as in the example of anharmonic oscillators . and even if there were a ground state , it is not clear at all if it would be a good choice . from the point of view of non - perturbative quantum gravity ,",
    "space - time in observationally accessible regimes is in a highly excited state with huge expectation values of geometrical operators such as the volume .",
    "if a state @xmath96 used to compute expectation values for an effective description is poincar invariant ( such as the minkowski vacuum ) and the quantization in one s approach to quantum gravity is covariant , effective constraints @xmath97 ( or the effective action ) are covariant .",
    "however , we may not have a poincar invariant state in quantum gravity ; certainly a minkowski vacuum as used in perturbative approaches would not be fundamental .",
    "in such a situation , poincar transformations would not be realized within one effective theory , even if the underlying quantum - gravity theory is covariant .",
    "one would still be able to deal with effective equations and obtain covariant results , somewhat analogous to background - field methods .",
    "but more care would be required .",
    "moreover , the usual arguments for effective gravitational actions with nothing but higher - curvature terms no longer hold : the setting is more general , allowing for different quantum corrections , potentially stronger than higher - curvature ones .",
    "to arrive at classifications of modified space - time structures , as they could result from non - invariant quantum states , a geometrical representation of space - time transformations is useful .",

    ".    properties of the basic algebra of operators illustrate the discreteness of spatial quantum geometry , and imply characteristic effects in composite ones , such as the hamiltonian constraint relevant for the dynamics .",
    "classically , the constraints are polynomial in @xmath143 .",

    "depending on the state , this scale may differ from the planck scale if quantum geometry is excited . dealing with a discrete version of quantum geometry",
    ", one must be careful with potential violations of poincar symmetries @xcite .",
    "the unbroken , deformed nature of quantum space - time symmetries ( [ hhbeta ] ) here provides consistency .",
    "these general statements show that we should expect three types of corrections in loop quantum gravity , irrespective of the detailed form of the theory .",
    "first , as in all interacting theories , we have quantum back - reaction . in gravitational theories ,",
    "this is the key ingredient that provides higher - derivative terms for curvature corrections @xcite .",
    "( for a related calculation in quantum cosmology , see @xcite . )",
    "the quantum structure of space then implies additional corrections , not so much from the specific dynamics but from the underlying quantum geometry .",
    "we have holonomy corrections , another form of higher - order corrections with different powers of the connection . in cosmological regimes ,",
    "these corrections are sensitive to the energy density , just like higher - curvature corrections but in a different form .",
    "( therefore , these corrections should not play much of a role for potential observations . ) finally , there are inverse - triad corrections that result from quantizing inverse triads using the identity @xcite @xmath154 the right - hand side is needed for the hamiltonian constraint of gravity , but flux operators are not invertible : they have discrete spectra containing zero .",
    "the left - hand side , on the other hand , does not require an inverse triad , and can be quantized using holonomy and volume operators , and turning the poisson bracket into a commutator divided by @xmath155 .",
    "while the equation is a classical identity , quantizing the left - hand side does not agree with inserting triad ( or flux ) eigenvalues in the right - hand side : the third source of quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "holonomy corrections can easily be illustrated in isotropic models . with this symmetry ,",
    "connection variables are @xmath156 and @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath159 depending only on time .",
    "the friedmann equation then reads @xmath160 the use of holonomies in the quantum representation implies that there is no operator for @xmath161 or @xmath162 , but only one for any linear combination of @xmath163 with real @xmath164 . to represent the hamiltonian constraint underlying the friedmann equation , one therefore chooses a modification such as @xmath165 in terms of periodic functions , with some parameter @xmath166 related to the precise quantization of the constraint . if @xmath167 is planckian , as often assumed , holonomy corrections are of the tiny order @xmath168 upon using the friedmann equation .    in isolation ,",
    "holonomy corrections imply a `` bounce '' of isotropic cosmological models , the main reason for interest in them .",
    "writing the constraint as a modified friedmann equation , @xmath169 with a bounded left - hand side leads to an upper bound on the energy density .",
    "unlike classically , the density can not grow beyond all bounds . at this stage , however , the upper bound is introduced by hand , modifying the classical dynamics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although the modification is motivated by quantum geometry via properties of holonomy operators , a robust implementation of singularity resolution in this effective picture requires a consistent implementation of quantum back - reaction and perturbative inhomogeneity .",
    "only if this complicated task can be completed can one claim that a reliable quantum effect is realized , one that holds in the presence of quantum interactions and takes into account correct quantum space - time structures . in loop quantum cosmology @xcite ,",
    "this effective picture has not yet been made robust , but there are more general no - singularity statements based on properties of dynamical states @xcite and effective actions for them @xcite .",
    "as we will see below , the traditional bounce picture must be modified considerably when inhomogeneity is taken into account .",
    "quantum back - reaction has been analyzed in bounce models by general effective expansions @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "while the equations remain complicated and not much is known about solutions , it is clear that density bounds hold at least for matter dominated by its kinetic energy term .",
    "the reason is that a free , massless scalar , whose energy is purely kinetic , provides a harmonic model in which basic operators and the hamiltonian form a closed linear algebra ( in a suitable factor ordering ) @xcite .",
    "no quantum back - reaction then exists , and the model can be solved exactly . for kinetic - dominated matter , one can use perturbation theory to show that bounds and bounces are still realized , but without kinetic domination , for instance if there is a slow - roll phase at high density , the presence of bounces remains questionable .",
    "one should also note that even the presence of a bounce of expectation values does not guarantee that evolution is fully deterministic .",
    "especially in harmonic cosmology , the evolution of fluctuations and some higher moments is so sensitive to initial values that it is practically impossible to recover the complete pre - bounce state from potentially observable information afterwards @xcite .",
    "( claims to the contrary are based on restricted classes of states . )",
    "this form of cosmic forgetfulness indicates that the bounce regime does have unexpected features of strong quantum effects , even when it is realized in a harmonic model free of quantum back - reaction .",
    "quantum space - time structure in the presence of holonomy corrections implies additional caveats , and finally removes deterministic trans - bounce evolution .",
    "quantum space - time structure follows from the hypersurface - deformation algebra realized with holonomy corrections in the presence of ( at least ) perturbative inhomogeneity .",
    "no complete version is known , and it is not even clear if holonomy corrections can be fully consistent .",
    "but some examples exist , in spherically symmetric models @xcite , in @xmath170-dimensional models @xcite ( with operator rather than effective calculations ) and for cosmological perturbations ignoring higher - order terms in a derivative expansion of holonomies @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the hypersurface - deformation algebra is not destroyed , implying consistency , but deformed : instead of ( [ hh ] ) we have ( [ hhbeta ] ) .    in cosmological settings , the correction function for holonomies has the form @xmath171 @xcite . assuming maximum density in ( [ modfried ] ) implies that @xmath172 is negative .",
    "( in the linear limit of fig .",
    "[ hypdeflin ] , we have the counter - intuitive relation @xmath173 for motion . )",
    "this sign change in the hypersurface - deformation algebra implies that the space - time signature turns euclidean @xcite ( to see this , one may draw fig .",
    "[ hypdeflin ] with euclidean right angles for the normals ) , and indeed evolution equations are elliptic rather than hyperbolic partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "( this is a concrete realization of the suggestions in @xcite , but by a different mechanism .",
    "it is also reminiscent of the no - boundary proposal @xcite . )",
    "there is no evolution through a `` bounce '' , but rather a signature - change scenario of early - universe cosmology .",
    "we obtain a non - singular beginning of lorentzian expansion when @xmath128 moves through zero depending on the energy density , a natural place to pose initial values for instance for an inflaton state .",
    "however , with uncertainties in quantum back - reaction and the precise form of holonomy corrections , the deep quantum regime remains poorly controlled .",
    "there is a significant amount of quantization ambiguities , and it remains unclear if holonomy corrections can be fully consistent .",
    "higher - curvature and holonomy corrections are both relevant at planckian density , when @xmath174 , but they remain incompletely known .",
    "good perturbative behavior is realized at observationally accessible densities far below the planck density , but the corrections are then so tiny that quantum gravity can not be tested and falsified based on them .",
    "holonomy corrections , therefore , are not relevant for potential observations .",
    "fortunately , loop quantum gravity offers a third option , inverse - triad corrections , by which it becomes falsifiable . to illustrate their derivation ,",
    "we assume a lattice state with u(1)-holonomies @xmath151 and fluxes @xmath175 .",
    "( normally , fluxes are associated with surfaces .",
    "but on a regular lattice we can uniquely assign plaquettes to edges , so that an edge label for fluxes is sufficient . ) with one ambiguity parameter @xmath176 , we then use poisson - bracket identities such as ( [ inverse ] ) to quantize an inverse flux as @xmath177 the relations @xmath178= -4\\pi\\gamma\\ell_{\\rm    p}^2\\hat{h}_e$ ] and @xmath179 , such that @xmath180 allow us to compute the expectation value @xcite @xmath181 where we have already indicated a moment expansion as in effective equations .",
    "we quantify these corrections , depending on a quantum - gravity scale @xmath182 related to flux expectation values , by a correction function @xmath183 whose @xmath184-dependent form is shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] .     of the discreteness scale @xmath185 and the planck length .",
    "the parameter @xmath184 labels a form of quantization ambiguity , but does not change characteristic features @xcite .",
    "[ alpha ] ]    there are characteristic properties in spite of quantization ambiguities such as the one parameterized by @xmath184 @xcite . for instance , for large fluxes",
    ", the classical value @xmath186 is always approached from above .",
    "inverse - triad corrections are large if the discreteness scale @xmath185 is nearly planckian , and small for larger vaues .",
    "the somewhat counter - intuitive feature that inverse - triad corrections are large for small discreteness scale @xmath185 can be understood from the fact that the corresponding operators eliminate classical divergences at degenerate @xmath135 , near @xmath187 @xcite . in this regime , for small fluxes , the corrections must therefore be strong .",
    "the behavior then has a welcome consequence : two - sided bounds on quantum corrections .",
    "inverse - triad corrections are large for small @xmath185 , and other discretization effects for instance in the gradient terms of matter hamiltonians are large for large @xmath185 .",
    "there is not just an upper bound , which one could always evade by tuning parameters .",
    "the theory becomes falsifiable .",
    "a theoretical estimate based on the relation to discretization and holonomy effects shows that @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "a less welcome consequence of the dependence on @xmath185 ( the state - dependent lattice spacing ) is that the size of corrections can not easily be estimated . but",
    "keeping @xmath185 as a parameter of the theory , its two - sided bounds still allow the effects to be tested .",
    "such a state dependence is to be expected because effective equations depend on the state , for which there is no natural choice , such as a vacuum , in quantum gravity .",
    "also holonomy corrections are subject to this ambiguity , even though it is often claimed that they are completely determined by the energy density , a classical parameter .",
    "however , this is the case only if the parameter @xmath166 in holonomy modifications ( [ modfried ] ) is fixed , for instance by the popular but ad - hoc choice @xmath189 , making holonomy corrections tiny and irrelevant for potential observations . since holonomy corrections and inverse - triad corrections enter one and the same operator , the hamiltonian constraint , and must refer to the same state , there is only the parameter @xmath185 that determines their size .",
    "holonomy corrections therefore are not uniquely fixed , and if one were to declare that @xmath190 , inverse - triad corrections would be large and the theory be ruled out .",
    "the freedom of parameters can not be avoided based on theoretical arguments alone .    as with holonomy corrections ,",
    "the question of anomaly freedom and quantum space - time structure must be addressed before corrections and their effects can be taken seriously .",
    "inverse - triad corrections are in a better position than holonomy corrections , with a more - complete status of consistent deformations .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is modified by the correction function @xmath191 from ( [ alphal ] ) multiplying each term that contains the inverse triad classically : @xmath192 & = & \\frac{1}{16\\pi\\gamma g } \\int_{\\sigma } \\mathrm{d}^3x   n\\alpha    \\left(\\epsilon_{ijk}f_{ab}^i\\frac{e^a_je^b_k}{\\sqrt{|\\det e| } } + h_{\\rm l } \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + h^{(\\alpha)}_{\\rm matter}[n ] + \\mbox{``counterterms''}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath193 is the curvature of the ashtekar  barbero connection , @xmath194 is an extra piece depending on extrinsic curvature , and `` counterterms '' are determined by the condition of anomaly freedom @xcite . together with the uncorrected diffeomorphism constraint @xmath109=\\int_{\\sigma}{\\rm d}^3x d_an^a= \\int_{\\sigma}{\\rm d}^3x f_{ab}^ie^b_in^a$ ] , the algebra then reads @xmath120,d[m^a]\\}&= & d[{\\cal l}_{m^a}n^a]\\\\   \\{h_{(\\alpha)}[n],d[m^a]\\ } & = & h_{(\\alpha)}[{\\cal l}_{m^a}n]\\\\   \\{h_{(\\alpha)}[n],h_{(\\alpha)}[m]\\ } & = &   d[\\alpha^2 q^{ab}(n\\partial_bm - m\\partial_bn)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( assuming constraints second order in inhomogeneity and @xmath195 small ) .",
    "the same algebra has been found in spherical symmetry @xcite and in @xmath170-dimensional models using operator calculations @xcite . as with holonomy corrections ,",
    "the form of the deformation appears robust and universal . in the linear limit as in fig .",
    "[ hypdeflin ] , we have @xmath196 and therefore expect quantum corrections to propagation . unlike for holonomy corrections ,",

    "corrections to propagation are realized more explicitly in mukhanov - type equations for gauge - invariant scalar and tensor perturbations @xcite , @xmath197 with @xmath198 ( a known but lengthy function ) and corrected @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "the propagation speed differs from the speed of light , and yet , as seen by the consistent constraint algebra , general covariance is not broken but deformed .",
    "a promising and rare feature is the fact that different corrections are found for scalar and tensor modes : corrections to the tensor - to - scalar ratio should be present , an interesting aspect regarding potential observations . like the corrections themselves ,",
    "effects are sensitive to the ratio @xmath201 , not directly to the density .",
    "in contrast to @xmath125 , this parameter can be significant during inflation .",
    "observational evaluations @xcite indeed provide an upper bound on inverse - triad corrections , which together with the theoretical lower bound allows only a finite window @xmath202 open by a reasonably small number of orders of magnitude .",
    "it is not certain whether loop quantum gravity can be fundamental , and the deep quantum regime ( around the big bang ) remains ambiguous and uncontrolled .",
    "nevertheless , the theory can be tested thanks to inverse - triad corrections , with the following properties :    * quantum effects are sensitive to the microscopic quantum - gravity scale in relation to the planck length , not to the classical energy density as expected from higher - curvature corrections .",
    "therefore , they can be significant in observationally accessible regimes .",
    "* they provide a consistent deformation of the classical hypersurface - deformation algebra , and thereby a well - defined notion of quantum space - time .",
    "* there is a viable phenomenology thanks to a small number of low - curvature parameters .",
    "all this is possible in the effective view of loop quantum gravity , in which the main achievement of the theory is to provide new terms for effective actions of quantum gravity .",
    "long - standing conceptual issues , such as the problem of time , can partially be solved at least in semiclassical regimes and do not preclude progress in physical evaluations of the theory .",
