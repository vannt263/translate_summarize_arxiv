    "discrimination between given hypotheses is one the most basic tasks in our every day lives .",
    "very often we are confronted with the necessity of having to identify an option between some possible choices based on some acquired evidence . in the quantum setting the discrimination problem",
    "consists of identifying one of two possible states given a number of identical copies available for measurement .",
    "this task encompasses a plethora of non - trivial theoretical and experimental implications . in the usual setting the a priori states are known , i.e. , the classical information characterizing the possible states is provided and the discrimination protocol is tailored for this specific information .",
    "one usually considers two types of approaches : unambiguous  @xcite and minimum error  @xcite discrimination .",
    "an unambiguous protocol is one where the identification of the state is error free .",
    "of course , this is only possible stochastically , i.e , unless the states are orthogonal , the protocol must give an inconclusive answer ( the `` i do not know '' outcome ) with a non vanishing probability . in the minimum error approach , the protocol always yields a definite answer , which may be wrong some of the times .",
    "an optimal protocol is one which minimizes the inconclusive or the error probability . it may also be possible to go continuously from one case to the other by considering margins of error probabilities  @xcite . in spite of being such a fundamental problem ,",
    "only very recently a closed expression for the asymptotic error probability has been obtained ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , the quantum chernoff bound , from which metric distances and state densities  @xcite can be derived .",
    "very much in the spirit of universal computers , it is interesting to consider discrimination devices that are not specialized in a specific discrimination instance but can discriminate between arbitrary pairs of states @xcite . in these ,",
    "the set of possible states enter the device as  programs \" , i.e. , the classical description of the states is not provided beforehand , rather the information is incorporated in a quantum way ( this can also be viewed as an instance of relative information  @xcite ) .",
    "these devices have program ports that are loaded with the program states , and a data port that is loaded with the unknown input state one wishes to identify .",
    "the device will identify the state of the data port as being one of the states fed in the program ports , but this identification will in general be erroneous with a probability that decreases with the number of copies of the states entering the ports .",
    "one can also regard these devices as learning machines  @xcite , where the device is instructed through the program ports about different states , and based on this knowledge the machine associates the state in the data port with one of the states belonging to the training set . increasing the number of copies of states at the program and data ports of course increases the chances of correct identification .",
    "it is particularly relevant to understand how the probability of error scales with an increasing number of copies and what are the corresponding error rates .",
    "the value of this rate is one of the most relevant parameters assessing the performance of the device .",
    "we will consider the discrimination of two general qubit states , although most of our results can be generalized to higher dimensional systems ( see @xcite for a single copy continuous variable setting ) .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the prior occurrence probability of each state is identical and compute the unambiguous and minimum error rates for optimal programmable devices .",
    "we first study the performance of such devices for pure states .",
    "we compute the error probabilities for any number of pure qubit states at the input ports .",
    "some of the results are already available in the literature  @xcite , but the way we formalize the problem here is crucial to treat the more general mixed state case .",
    "in addition we obtain analytical expressions that enable us to present the results and study limiting cases in a unified way . in particular , when the program ports are loaded with an infinitely large number of copies of the states we recover the usual state discrimination problem  @xcite , since it is clear that then one has the classical information determining the states entering the program ports . on the other hand ,",
    "when the number of copies at the data port is infinitely large , while the number of copies at the program ports are kept finite , we recover the state comparison problem  @xcite .",
    "we extend the previous pure state study to the case of mixed input states . in this scenario",
    "we only compute the minimum error probability , as no unambiguous answers can be given if the states have the same support  @xcite .",
    "the performance of the device for a given purity of the input states allows to quantify how the discrimination power is degraded in the presence of noise .",
    "the expressions here are much more involved , however one can still exploit the permutation symmetry of the input states to write the problem in a block - diagonal form  @xcite .",
    "we then obtain closed expressions for the probability of error that can be computed analytically for small number of copies and numerically evaluated for a fairly large number of copies .",
    "we are also able to obtain analytical expressions for some asymptotic rates .",
    "again , the leading term , as in the pure state case , is seen to coincide with the average minimum error for known states .",
    "we also analyze the fully universal discrimination machine , i.e. , a device that works optimally for completely unknown input states . in this case one",
    "has to assume a uniform distribution for the purity .",
    "in contrast to the pure state distribution , there is no unique choice  @xcite , and different reasonable assumptions lead to different uniform priors .",
    "here we consider hard - sphere , bures and chernoff priors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we obtain the error probabilities for pure states when each program port is fed with @xmath0 copies of each state and there are @xmath1 copies of the unknown state entering the data port . in sec",
    "[ sec : pure - limits ] we study the asymptotic rates in several scenarios . in section  [ sec : mixed ] we analyze the performance of these devices when the ports are loaded with copies of states of known purity and obtain some interesting limiting cases in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixed - limits ] .",
    "we finally obtain the error rates for the fully universal programmable machine .",
    "some brief conclusions follow and we end up with two technical appendices .",
    "let us start by fixing the notation and conventions used throughout this paper .",
    "we label the two program ports by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "they will be loaded with states @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the data port , @xmath6 , is the middle one and will be loaded with the states we wish to identify .",
    "we also use the short hand notation @xmath7 $ ] to denote @xmath8 and similarly @xmath9 = [ \\psi]\\otimes[\\phi]\\otimes\\cdots={\\left|{\\psi}\\rangle\\!\\langle{\\psi}\\right|}\\otimes { \\left|{\\phi}\\rangle\\!\\langle{\\phi}\\right|}\\otimes\\cdots$ ] .",
    "we may also omit the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath3 when no confusion arises .",
    "we assume that the program ports are fed with @xmath0 copies of each state and the data port with @xmath1 copies of the unknown state .",
    "this is a rather general case for which closed expressions of the error probabilities can be given .",
    "the case with arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath12 copies at each port is discussed in appendix  [ na - nb - nc ] .",
    "the expressions are more involved but the techniques are a straightforward extension of the ones presented here .    when the state at the data port is @xmath13 or @xmath14 , the effective states entering the machine are given by the averages @xmath15_a [ \\psi_1^{\\otimes m}]_b [ \\psi_2^{\\otimes n}]_c \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\sigma_2&=&\\int d\\psi_1 d\\psi_2 [ \\psi_1^{\\otimes n}]_a [ \\psi_2^{\\otimes m}]_b [ \\psi_2^{\\otimes n}]_c\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . the integrals can be easily computed using schur lemma , @xmath16_x = \\frac{1}{d_x } \\openone_x$ ] , where @xmath17 is the dimension of the hilbert space spanned by @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the projector onto this space .",
    "hence @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the projector onto the completely symmetric subspace of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is its dimension .",
    "for qubits we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the structure of the states suggests the use of the angular momentum basis , @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 recall the way the three spins are coupled to give the total angular momentum @xmath32 . here",
    "the angular momenta have a fixed value determined by the number of copies at the ports , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "so , we can very much ease the notation by only writing explicitly the labels @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we would like to stress however that in general one needs to keep track of all the quantum numbers , specially when dealing with mixed states as in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixed ] .    in @xmath27",
    "the first @xmath37 spins are coupled in a symmetric way , while in @xmath29 the symmetrized spins are the last @xmath37 , thus @xmath38 .",
    "the states are diagonal in the angular momentum bases discussed above , and we have @xmath39\\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma_2&= & \\frac{1}{d_a d_{bc}}\\sum_{j=0,1/2}^{m/2+n } \\sum_{m =- j}^{j } [ j_{bc};j m]\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lower limit of the first summation takes the value 0 ( 1/2 ) for @xmath1 even ( odd ) . notice that the spectrum of both matrices is identical and that the basis elements of their support differ only in the way the three spins are coupled .",
    "further , the key feature of the total angular momentum bases is the orthogonality relation @xmath40 bases of this type are known as jordan bases of subspaces  @xcite . since a state of the first basis ( labeled by @xmath41 ) has overlap with only one state of the second basis ( labeled by @xmath42 ) , the problem is reduced to a discrimination instance between pairs of pure states .",
    "then the total error probability is simply the sum of the contributions of each pair .    in the unambiguous approach ,",
    "the minimum probability of an inconclusive result for a pair of states @xmath43 with equal priors is simply @xmath44 @xcite , hence @xmath45 these overlaps can be computed in terms of the wigner 6-@xmath46 symbols  @xcite :    @xmath47    and they are independent of @xmath48  @xcite , therefore in what follows we omit writing the quantum number @xmath48 , and we perform the sum over @xmath48 in trivially by adding the multiplicative factor @xmath49 . substituting the value of the @xmath50 symbols for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath51 , and setting @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53 with @xmath54",
    "( observe that @xmath32 takes values from @xmath55 of the totally symmetric space down to @xmath56 ) .",
    "plugging the overlaps eq .   into eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath57 where notice that the dimension of the subspace of total angular momentum @xmath32 is @xmath58 and in the second equality we have used the binomial sums @xmath59 in the minimum error approach no inconclusive results are allowed , but the machine is permitted to give wrong answers with some probability that one tries to minimize .",
    "this minimum error probability can be computed along the same lines as in the previous case .",
    "recall that the error probability @xmath60 for two pure states @xmath43 and equal a priori probabilities is @xcite @xmath61 the total error probability is just the sum of the contribution of each pair of states with the same quantum numbers @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 it is instructive to obtain the well - known results when the ports are loaded with just one copy of each state  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "the inconclusive probability in the unambiguous approach reads @xmath66 i.e. , five out of six times the machine gives an inconclusive result and only 1/6 of the times identifies the state without error .",
    "notice that the overlaps for @xmath67 are one .",
    "this must be so since @xmath67 corresponds to the totally symmetric subspace , which is independent of the way the spins coupled .",
    "that is , this subspace is identical for @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "this is the main source of error as it contributes @xmath68 out of the total @xmath69 error probability .",
    "the remaining @xmath70 is the contribution of the @xmath71 subspace , where the @xmath72 is the probability of having an outcome on this subspace and @xmath73 is the overlap between the states [ cf .",

    "the minimum error probability in the one copy case reads @xmath74 which using eq .   or directly eq .   gives @xmath75 that is , approximately 1/3 of the times the outcome of the machine will be incorrect .",

    "they enable us to study the behaviour of the machine for a large number of copies in the program and the data ports , which is what we next discuss .",

    "for the unambiguous discrimination one obtains from eq .",

    ". the average of the inconclusive probability of this protocol over all input states should coincide with eq .  .",

    "we now move to the case when the program and data ports are loaded with mixed states .",
    "this situation arises when , e.g. , there are imperfections in the preparation or noise in the transmission of the states .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that these imperfections have the same effect on all states , i.e. to consider that the states have all the same purity @xmath135 .",
    "the input states are then tensor products of @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a unitary vector and @xmath138 are the usual pauli matrices . in what follows",
    "we assume that only the purity is known , i.e. one knows the characteristics of the noise affecting the states , but nothing else .",
    "this means that the averages will be performed over the isotropic haar measure of the @xmath139 sphere , like for pure states . at the end of this section",
    "we also analyze the performance of a fully universal discrimination machine , that is , when not even the purity is considered to be known .",
    "notice that mixed states can only be unambiguously discriminated if they have different supports @xcite , which is not the case when the ports are loaded with copies of the states as they are full - rank matrices .",
    "therefore , only the minimum error discrimination approach will be analyzed here .",
    "it is worth stressing that the computation of the optimal error probability in the multi - copy case is very non - trivial , even for known qubit mixed states .",
    "only recently feasible methods for computing the minimum error probability for a rather large number of copies have been developed and the asymptotic expression of this probability has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty can be traced back to the computation of the trace - norm [ see eq . ] of large matrices .",
    "the dimension of the matrices grows exponentially with the total number of copies entering the machine , and for a relative small number of them the problem becomes unmanageable .",
    "however , as it will be clear , it is possible to exploit the permutation symmetry of the input states to write them in block - diagonal form  @xcite crucially reducing the complexity of the problem .",
    "the two effective states we have to discriminate are @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the invariant measure on the two - sphere .",
    "any state having permutation invariance , as e.g. @xmath142 , can be written in a block diagonal form using the irreducible representations of the symmetric group @xmath143 .",
    "each block is specified by the total angular momentum @xmath46 and a label @xmath144 that distinguishes the different equivalent representations for a given @xmath46 @xmath145 the angular momentum takes values for odd ( even ) @xmath0 and the number of equivalent representations for each @xmath46 is  @xcite @xmath146 that is @xmath147 . for each block",

    "the actual values of the the probability of error may depend on the chosen prior , but the overall performance is seen to be very similar .",
    "the most straightforward , but perhaps not very well grounded , choice is that of the distribution of a hard - sphere @xmath289 , i.e. , a normalized integration measure given by @xmath290    the bures distribution is far better motivated .",

    "it is the prior induced by the chernoff distance , which has a clear operational meaning in terms of the distinguishability between states . by construction",
    "it is monotonically decreasing under coarse graining .",
    "this measure assigns even larger weights to states of high purity and lower to the very mixed ones .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] we present the minimum error probability of the fully universal machine for the three priors discussed for an equal number of program and data states up to @xmath298 .",
    "as anticipated , the smaller average error corresponds to the chernoff distance , because states with higher purity are assigned a larger weight , and these are easier to discriminate .",
    "the probability of error , as somehow expected , is inversely proportional to the number of copies , and attains very similar values than for the discrimination of states with fixed known purity of the order of @xmath299 .",

    "we have obtained analytical expressions for the leading and sub - leading terms in several cases of interest . as could be anticipated , when the number of copies at the program ports is asymptotically large at leading order we recover the average of the usual discrimination problem of known states  eqs . and . when the data port is loaded with an asymptotically large number of copies , we recover the state comparison averaged error eqs .   and .",
    "these cases correspond to measure and discriminate protocols , where the measurement unveils the classical information about the states .",
    "we have addressed for the first time the programmable discrimination of copies of mixed states .",
    "we have obtained the minimum - error probability when the ports are loaded with copies of qubits of known purity , eq .  .",
    "we have assumed that all states have the same purity .",
    "this would , e.g. , correspond to a scenario where all the initially pure data and program states are subject to the same depolarizing noise before entering the machine .",
    "closed analytical results for a small number of copies can be obtained and efficiently computable expressions for a fairly large number of copies are given .",
    "the asymptotic analytical results show very good agreement with the numerics . the latter show a characteristic @xmath300 dependence with the number @xmath301 of available copies in contrast to the usual exponential decay found in standard ( non - universal ) state discrimination and provide a very good approximation already for relatively low number of copies when the states have high purity .",
    "for very mixed states the error probability has a drastically different behavior .",
    "logically , in both cases the error probability monotonically decreases with increasing purity @xmath135 , but in the low purity regime the dependence is much less pronounced . the range of purities exhibiting this behavior shrinks as the number of copies increases , and the characteristic @xmath300 behavior of the asymptotic regime extends its validity over almost the whole range of purities .",
    "finally we have studied the fully universal discrimination machine , a device that takes in states of which nothing is known , i.e. , not even its purity .",
    "we compute the minimum error probability for three reasonable prior distributions of the purity : hard - sphere , bures and chernoff ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "the latter is seen to give the lowest error probability .",
    "this comes as no surprise , since the chernoff distribution assigns larger weights to pure states ( because they are better distinguished ) .",
