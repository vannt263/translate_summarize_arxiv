    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model [ mssm ] gauge super - multiplets are built up by two components , bosonic gauge fields and fermionic gaugino fields , refs .",
    "since neutral vector fields are self - conjugate , the corresponding supersymmetric partners are majorana fields . condensing the gluon fields in the color - octet matrix @xmath3 and the gluinos in the color - octet matrix @xmath4 , the ( color ) charge conjugate fields @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are related to the original fields by @xmath7 for the electroweak gauge and higgs bosons and the neutralinos , mixtures of fermionic gauginos and higgsinos , analogous relations hold .",
    "the gluino and neutralino majorana particles carry masses which are rooted in the higgs and the ( soft ) supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "massive majorana fields can be distinguished experimentally from dirac fields in gauge theories quite generally .",
    "[ for massless fields the distinction is more subtle , depending on the form of the interactions in the theory . ]",
    "in this report we will study the characteristic differences between majorana and dirac fields and work out the experimental implications .",
    "the analyses will be performed in a hybrid scheme , ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the minimal n=1 supersymmetric standard model is extended by gauge elements of n=2 supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "majorana fields in n=1 supersymmetric theories are characterized by two self - conjugate l- and r - components in parallel to the two vector field components .",
    "these fermionic components can be paired with two additional fermionic fields in n=2 supersymmetric theories , in which a vector super - multiplet is combined with an additional chiral super - multiplet to a vector hyper - multiplet . if the majorana masses are identical and the fields are mixed maximally , the four fermionic degrees of freedom can join to a dirac field and its charge - conjugate companion @xcite . in this limit",
    "the theory includes vector fields , dirac gaugino fields and scalars , all states belonging to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the four higgs superfields belong to a chiral and an anti - chiral multiplet .",
    "by contrast , the matter superfields _ sui generis _ are restricted in the n=1/n=2 hybrid scheme to the standard n=1 chiral component in accordance with the experimental fact that matter fermions are chiral .    in this setup",
    "the n=2 gauge interactions are an extension of the familiar n=1 gauge interactions .",
    "the additional component of the n=2 interaction between the new gaugino field and the higgs fields can be reinterpreted as component of a superpotential affecting the neutralino and chargino masses after the electroweak symmetry is broken . [ in addition the higgs self - interactions are modified , not affecting the present analysis though . ]",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking gives rise , at the phenomenological level , to three gaugino mass parameters : two majorana masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a mixing term @xmath10 . the first majorana mass may be associated with the n=1 gaugino mass term , and the second with the new gaugino field . diagonalizing the @xmath11 mass matrix generates two majorana masses @xmath12 and a mixing angle @xmath13 , which relates the mass eigenstates to the original current states . depending on the supersymmetry breaking parameters",
    ", @xmath13 can assume any value between 0 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to design a path in mass - parameter space such that the dirac limit can be approached smoothly .",
    "tuning the diagonal mass parameters @xmath15 to zero , only the off - diagonal mixing term @xmath10 survives and , as a result , the mass eigenvalues @xmath12 become identical , _ modulo _ sign , and the mixing of the states maximal , @xmath16 . in the maximal mixing limit",
    "the two majorana states combine into one dirac fermion ( and its antifermion partner ) .",
    "maximal mixing of majorana particles guarantees the vanishing of transition amplitudes generally associated with the exchange of dirac particles .",
    "this procedure is well suited for the strong interaction sector .",
    "the electroweak sector is less transparent due to the complicated mixing effects beyond the soft supersymmetry breaking terms after electroweak symmetry breaking . in the limit",
    "in which the supersymmetry breaking scale is significantly larger than the electroweak scale , the dirac limit is approached approximately .",
    "though sounding strange at first glance , it is clear in the light of the previous comments that a quantitative definition can be formulated for the concept of a near - dirac field or particle .    adopting this extension of the mssm to a n=1/n=2 hybrid model , observables can be designed for experimental analyses at the lhc @xcite , which allow us to follow a smooth transition from a majorana theory of gluinos ( and neutralinos ) to a dirac theory .",
    "the standard examples are the equal - chirality transition amplitudes @xmath17 these amplitudes are non - zero for majorana gluino exchange but they vanish for dirac gluino exchange in the n=1/n=2 hybrid theory . [ the same arguments can be applied to @xmath18 , and l@xmath19 r , for electroweak gauginos .",
    "] however , amplitudes for the transition from 2-fermion to 0-fermion states do not vanish in general . in the present context the mixed - chirality amplitude @xmath20 is non - zero for dirac exchange and , in fact , equal to the amplitude for majorana exchange [ analogously for @xmath21 scattering ] .",
    "using left / right - handedly polarized beams in the @xmath22 collision mode of a linear collider @xcite , the rules outlined above can easily be applied for studying the majorana / dirac nature of neutralinos experimentally . in addition , it has been demonstrated earlier when discussing potential measurements of the @xmath23 yukawa coupling , refs .",

    "@xcite can be transferred , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", easily . the potential of like - sign dilepton signatures for discriminating majorana from dirac structures of supersymmetric theories has also been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these processes are complementary to tests of the majorana nature of gluinos in gluino decays , notably to top plus stop final states , which have been discussed widely in the literature @xcite .",
    "moreover , two - gluino final states decaying to bottom + sbottom quarks have served as an important channel for searching for supersymmetry at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "likewise , analyses of like - sign chargino production @xcite at the lhc and neutralino decays @xcite have been studied extensively in the past for testing the majorana character of neutralinos .",
    "the report is organized as follows . in the next section 2",
    "we define the essential elements of the n=1/n=2 hybrid model and establish the phenomenological base . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss subsequently the strong interaction gluino sector and the electroweak sector , including the concept of a near - dirac field , first in the limit in which the electroweak breaking scale can be neglected compared to the supersymmetry parameters , and second the systematic approximation to this limit . in section 5 like - sign",
    "dileptons will be analyzed as a signal for the majorana to dirac transition at the lhc , before section 6 concludes this study .",
    "in the mssm based on n=1 supersymmetry , bosonic gauge fields are one - to - one paired with fermionic spin 1/2 gaugino fields and higgs bosons with higgsinos .",
    "fermionic lepton and quark matter fields are paired with bosonic spin-0 sleptons and squarks .",
    "the neutral gauginos in this ensemble are self - conjugate majorana fields with two chirality components corresponding to the two helicity states of the gauge fields .",
    "decay channels of these particles and their exchange in production processes generate characteristic signatures of their majorana nature . the uniqueness of these characteristics can be proven by comparing the signatures with predictions derived from dirac theories .",
    "it turns out that n=2 supersymmetry offers a theoretically solid platform for a consistent comparison between majorana and dirac theories @xcite .",
    "the gauge super - multiplets are expanded to hyper - multiplets which incorporate new chiral superfields composed of a gaugino and a scalar field . in the following these new gaugino fields",
    "will be labeled by an apostrophe . for the standard su(3)@xmath27su(2)@xmath27u(1 ) gauge group the n=2 fields and their components",
    "are summarized in table  [ tab : hyper ] . as argued before , the superposition    .the n=2 gauge hyper - multiplets . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     also shown in the table is the ratio of reconstructed positively and negatively charged lepton pairs , @xmath28 , for each of the production channels . as a result of the more realistic simulation , the values for @xmath28 are washed out compared to the naive estimates of the previous subsection",
    ".    for an integrated luminosity of @xmath29 300 fb@xmath30 at the lhc one obtains the following event numbers for the final states with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 \\mbox{dirac : } & \\qquad n(\\ell^+\\ell^+ ) = 2,400 & & n(\\ell^-\\ell^- ) = 1,800 & & n(\\ell^+\\ell^+)/n(\\ell^-\\ell^- ) = 1.33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is advantageous to focus on cross section ratios only , so that uncertainties for the total luminosity and the branching ratios in the decay chains eq .",
    "cancel out . from the measurement of the ratio @xmath28 the dirac theory , in comparison to the majorana theory , can be rejected with a statistical significance of more than 7@xmath34 .    however , systematic error sources are important and need to be taken into account .",
    "large sources for systematic uncertainties are the measurement of the squark and gluino masses , the proton parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and missing next - to - next - to - leading order radiative corrections for the production cross sections .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume @xmath35  gev and @xmath36  gev and derive the error from higher order corrections from the scale dependence of the next - to - leading order result @xcite . for the pdfs",
    "we expect that the current uncertainty will be improved by a factor of two due to the final hera analyses for the gluon pdf , and tevatron and lhc data for the quark pdfs . including these systematic errors , the significance is reduced to a level of about 2@xmath37 .",
    "fortunately the result can be improved considerably by considering the distribution of the transverse momentum of the third hardest jet , @xmath38 in the signal events , which accentuates gluino decays . due to the extra jet from the gluino decay @xmath39 ,",
    "this distribution is sensitive to the relative contributions from squark pair production , squark - gluino production , and gluino pair production . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt3 ] , in the majorana theory the @xmath40-distribution is peaked at low values of @xmath40 , as a result of the sizable contribution from @xmath41 production . on the other hand ,",
    "the dirac theory predicts a relatively larger signal from the squark - gluino super - compton process compared to squark pair production .",
    "the gluino decay leads to a hard third jet , so that the @xmath40-distribution falls off more slowly towards high momenta .    dividing the @xmath40-spectrum into 3 bins in the range @xmath42 $ ]  gev",
    ", a fit to the distributions for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 final states allows a statistical discrimination between the majorana and dirac theory with 11.3 standard deviations ( for @xmath29 300 fb@xmath30 ) . taking into account systematic errors as above",
    ", we find that the dirac theory can be separated from the majorana theory by more than 10.7@xmath34 .    finally , we comment on a subtle issue : if the yukawa coupling between gluinos , squarks and quarks is treated as an unknown parameter , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one may worry that a non - standard value of the yukawa coupling mimics the effect of the dirac theory at the lhc .",
    "we have analyzed this problem by repeating the fit to the @xmath40-spectrum with the yukawa coupling as a free parameter .",
    "we have also included a total cross section measurement in this fit , with a conservative error of 30% .",
    "it turns out that with a free - floating yukawa coupling the majorana and dirac theories can be distinguished with a reduced statistical significance of 4.7@xmath37 ( 4.5@xmath37 including systematics ) .",
    "thus , with a medium significance , the yukawa coupling and the majorana / dirac nature of the gluinos can be determined simultaneously and independently .",
    "if supersymmetry is realized in nature at low energies , the next steps after the discovery of supersymmetric particles will be the measurement of their properties . while the measurements of masses , spins and yukawa couplings at the lhc has been discussed in earlier reports @xcite , we have focused here on studies of the majorana nature of gluinos [ and in a restricted form on neutralinos which will be treated in depth in a later investigation ] .",
    "the parallelism between self - conjugate neutral gauge bosons and their fermionic supersymmetric partners induces the majorana nature of these particles in the minimal formulation of the theory .",
    "nevertheless , experimental tests of the majorana character would provide non - trivial insight into the potential realization of supersymmetry in nature , since extended supersymmetric models can include dirac gauginos .",
    "n=2 supersymmetry provides a solid theoretical basis for formulating such a testing ground .",
    "since the fermionic degrees of freedom are doubled in the gauge sector , the ensuing two majorana fields can be joined to a single dirac field if the masses are chosen identical . moreover , a continuous path could be designed connecting the original mssm n=1 majorana theory and the n=2 dirac theory by variation of mass parameters .",
    "the mssm corresponds in this frame to a parameter space point in which one of the n=2 mass parameters is shifted to infinity , leading to the decoupling of the additional gaugino states . for equal mass parameters , on the other side ,",
    "the dirac theory emerges in a natural way .",
    "it is interesting to note that the transition from the majorana to the dirac theory is smooth , suggesting the notion of a near - dirac field in the approach to the dirac limit .",
    "this notion proves very useful in the analysis of the two theories .",
    "there are several methods to investigate the majorana nature of gluinos . in the original form , decays to heavy stop / top quarks are exploited @xcite to study that the final state in the fermion decay @xmath45 is self - conjugate . in this report",
    "we have explored an alternative by studying the nature of @xmath46-channel exchanged gluinos . while the cross section for the scattering processes with equal - chirality quarks @xmath47 is non - zero in the majorana theory , it vanishes in the dirac theory .",
    "likewise for two r - chiralities .",
    "however , note that two unlike - chirality quarks can generate squarks also in the dirac theory .",
    "l - squarks in the final state can be tagged by measuring the lepton charges in their chargino decay modes .",
    "owing to the dominance of @xmath48-quarks over @xmath49-quarks in the proton , the majorana theory predicts large rates of like - sign dilepton final states from squark pair production with an excess of positively charged leptons while they are absent , apart from a small number of remnant channels , in the dirac theory . in a realistic analysis one",
    "has to include gluino production processes which can also feed the like - sign dilepton signal but can be discriminated by extra jet emission from the gluino decays .",
    "_ conclusio generalis _",
    ", the majorana theory can be discriminated from the dirac theory using like - sign dilepton events at the level of more than 10@xmath37 .    in this analysis we focussed on a scenario where gluinos are somewhat heavier than first and second generation squarks .",
    "if gluinos are much lighter , most squarks will decay into gluinos rather than into neutralinos and charginos . in this case one expects , _ in toto _ , approximately equal @xmath50 and @xmath51 events in both the majorana and the dirac theory .",
    "however , the dominant process will then be gluino pair production , which has a two times larger cross section in the dirac theory .",
    "in addition , left / right - chiral correlations among top or bottom quark pairs in gluino - pair decays are different in the majorana and dirac theory and they generate different experimental signatures . while we did not perform a detailed analysis of such a scenario , we expect that the two discriminants should allow a clean separation of the majorana and dirac theories also in this case .",
    "similar analyses can also be designed for electroweak neutralinos .",
    "some of these tests can be performed at the lhc while other very clean reactions , like @xmath1 , can be carried out at tev linear colliders .",
    "the results of these investigations will be presented in a sequel to this report .",

    "<S> _ gluinos and neutralinos , supersymmetric partners of gluons and neutral electroweak gauge and higgs bosons , are majorana particles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model [ mssm ] . </S>",
