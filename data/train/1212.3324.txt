    "one of the main goals of this paper is to explain how the standard correspondence between the edge state spectrum and the values of bulk topological invariants is modified for periodically driven systems .",
    "specifically , our goal is to identify topological invariants for bulk systems ( i.e.  for systems without edges ) which give the numbers of protected modes that appear in geometries with edges . toward this aim ,",
    "we begin this section with a brief review of floquet band theory in order to define what we mean by the `` band structure '' of a periodically driven system .",
    "we then compare and contrast the static and driven cases , and give a concrete example that demonstrates the situation where intuition from the static case breaks down .",
    "in general , the evolution of a system governed by a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath7 may be quite complicated .",
    "however , in the case where the hamiltonian depends _ periodically _ on time , @xmath8 for some driving period @xmath2 , floquet theory provides a powerful framework for analysis . in analogy with the usual expansion in terms of stationary eigenstates of a static hamiltonian , here the evolution",
    "is conveniently described in terms of a basis of _ floquet states . _",
    "these states are solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 . under the action of the evolution operator @xmath11 over one complete period of driving",
    ", each floquet state is mapped onto itself up to a phase : @xmath12 . in a stroboscopic sense ,",
    "the floquet states play the role of stationary states for @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 , called the quasi - energy , is uniquely defined up to integer multiples of @xmath13 : any given solution with quasi - energy @xmath0 can also be associated with a quasi - energy @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an integer , through the relation @xmath16 . similar to the crystal momentum of a system with discrete translational symmetry , the quasi - energy can be thought of as a periodic variable defined on a quasi - energy brillouin zone @xmath17 .",
    "when a system has both discrete time and spatial translation symmetries , the floquet states are labeled by @xmath0 and the crystal momentum @xmath18 .",
    "the floquet spectrum then consists of a set of bands @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a band index .",
    "we now explore the ways in which the topological properties of floquet bands are similar to , and different from , those of the conventional bands of static systems .",
    "consider first a static ( non - driven ) two - band system , such as the haldane model@xcite , which exhibits a well - defined band gap .",
    "a chern number can be defined for each band @xmath20 by integrating the berry curvature associated with the two component spinor eigenstates @xmath21 over the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "if the parameters are such that the chern numbers of the two bands are non - zero , we will find chiral edge modes traversing the band gap when the system is defined in a finite geometry with an edge .",
    "the existence of these edge modes is `` protected , '' in the sense that the modes can not be destroyed by any continuous changes of parameters unless the band gap closes .",
    "mathematically , the chern number of a band is equal to the _ difference _ between the numbers of chiral edge modes entering the band from below and exiting above .",
    "because the spectrum of a static system is bounded , there can never be any chiral edge modes extending beyond the bottom of the lowest band , or above the top of the uppermost band .",
    "therefore , in a static two - band system , the chern number uniquely defines the net number of chiral edge states crossing the band gap .",
    "now consider a periodically driven system .",
    "we can define a chern number for each floquet band @xmath20 in the same way as in the static case : the chern number is obtained by integrating the berry curvature associated with the floquet states @xmath22 , evaluated at any fixed time @xmath23 , over the crystal momentum brillouin zone ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : relation ] for a precise definition ) . for concreteness",
    "we typically evaluate the chern numbers using the floquet state wave functions at time @xmath24 .",
    "however , the chern number is in fact independent of the time at which the floquet states are evaluated @xcite .    like the static case , the chern number of a floquet band is equal to the difference between the numbers of chiral modes above and below a given floquet band",
    "however , due to the periodicity of quasi - energy , the floquet spectrum is _ not bounded_. in particular , in a two - band system , a chiral edge mode that extends out above the top of the `` upper '' band can pass through the quasi - energy brillouin zone edge at @xmath25 , and enter the bottom of the `` lower '' band , from below . using the rule that the chern number gives the difference between the numbers of edge states above and below a band , we see that chiral edge states _ can _ be found between the two bands of a system with zero chern numbers , provided that a `` winding '' edge state also connects them through the quasi - energy zone edge .    to understand how such a situation can arise in a periodically - driven system , it is useful to consider the following thought experiment",
    ". suppose we start with a system in which the floquet bands have vanishing chern numbers , and in which there are _ no _ chiral edge modes in a finite geometry .",
    "the band structure of a strip , as a function of the momentum @xmath26 along the strip , will resemble the one shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram]a .",
    "note that , as discussed above , there are two gaps to consider between the two bands : the gap centered at zero quasi - energy and the gap centered at @xmath27 .",
    "now imagine that we tune some parameters in the hamiltonian . as parameters",
    "are changed , one of these gaps , e.g.  the one at @xmath27 , may close and reopen , in such a way that the chern numbers of both bands become non - zero .",
    "after the reopening of the gap , the quasi - energy spectrum will look like the one in fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram]b , with chiral edge modes crossing the @xmath27 gap .",
    "as parameters are varied further , the @xmath28 gap may close and reopen , bringing the chern numbers of both bands back to zero .",
    "however , the chiral edge modes in the @xmath27 gap can not disappear during this process , since the @xmath27 gap remains open throughout it . therefore ,",
    "after reopening the @xmath28 gap , another chiral edge mode must appear around @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram]c ) such that the difference of the number of chiral edge modes below and above each band is zero .",
    "thus we may obtain the situation where chiral edge modes exist despite all chern numbers being zero .",
    "the example above shows that the _ bulk _ floquet operator , @xmath11 , does not carry sufficient information to predict the number of chiral floquet edge modes ( note that the edge state spectrum will of course be exhibited explicitly if @xmath11 is evaluated directly for a system with boundaries ) . here",
    ", we construct new invariants defined in terms of the _ full time - dependent _ bulk evolution operator @xmath29 , evaluated for all intermediate times within the driving period .",
    "these invariants contain the missing information needed to predict the complete floquet edge state spectrum .",
    "in this section we illustrate the breakdown of the traditional bulk - edge correspondence for a floquet system by analyzing an explicit two - dimensional tight - binding model .",
    "this model is chosen for conceptual simplicity ; a more realistic model for experimental implementations will be discussed in sec .",

    "are set to 0 , but the sublattice potential is still allowed to act .",
    "this `` holding period '' is needed in order to ensure that the model has a sufficiently rich phase diagram to fully illustrate the topological classification that we will develop below .",
    "the driving protocol is inherently chiral , as the cycle can be executed in two inequivalent patterns ( @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) .    for an infinite system ( or a finite system with periodic boundary conditions ) , translational invariance can be exploited to reduce the problem of finding the floquet operator for this system to multiplying a small number of pauli matrices .",
    "the simplest case , illustrated in figs.[figsquare]b and c , occurs when @xmath50 and @xmath44 .",
    "here , a particle moves with probability 1 between neighboring sites during each hopping step of the cycle .",
    "as shown by the light blue trajectory in fig.[figsquare]b , over one complete driving cycle each particle makes a loop around a plaquette and returns to its initial position .",
    "therefore the bulk floquet operator for this case is simply the identity .",
    "the floquet spectrum features two degenerate bands collapsed at quasi - energy zero . because the bands are fully collapsed , none of the standard invariants for two - dimensional systems can take non - trivial values .",
    "what happens in a finite system with an edge ? naively , it appears that the floquet operator @xmath51 describes the trivial stroboscopic dynamics of a system with an effective hamiltonian @xmath52 .",
    "however , using the strip geometry shown in fig.[figsquare]b it is straightforward to check that the system supports chiral propagating edge modes localized on the boundaries . over each complete driving cycle , a particle moves by one unit cell along the edge .",
    "these modes appear in the spectrum as two linearly - dispersing branches with group velocities @xmath53 , see fig.[figsquare]c .    now consider the time - reversed cycle ( @xmath49 ) , which has the opposite chirality . here ,",
    "although particles circle around the plaquettes in the anti - clockwise direction , the floquet operator ( which is still identity ) is the same as that of the original cycle .",
    "thus the information about the circulation direction , which is contained in the bulk evolution operator for intermediate times within the driving cycle , is absent in the floquet operator .",
    "physically , this information is of crucial importance , however , as it determines the propagation direction of the edge states when the system is terminated .",
    "thus it is clear that a full topological characterization of these new phases requires an invariant defined in terms of the evolution operator evaluated throughout the entire driving period .",
    "in this section we define an integer invariant which can be used to correctly predict the edge state spectrum for a two dimensional periodically driven system .",
    "we begin by setting up the problem .",
    "let us consider a periodically driven , tight binding model defined on a 2d lattice with @xmath54 sites per unit cell ",
    "i.e.  a generalization of ( [ hexample ] ) .",
    "suppose that the hopping amplitudes are translationally invariant and have finite range .",
    "working in @xmath18-space , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 label the sites in each unit cell and @xmath18 lies in the first brillouin zone .",
    "all of the bulk properties of the system are encoded in the @xmath57 hermitian matrix @xmath58 . in particular ,",
    "the bulk time evolution operator can be computed as @xmath59 while the bulk floquet operator corresponds to the special case @xmath60 .",
    "let us suppose that the floquet spectrum has a gap extending over some finite interval @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "then , if we define the model in a geometry with an edge , any floquet eigenstates with eigenvalues lying in this interval must be localized near the boundary .",
    "these eigenstates correspond to edge modes . in analogy with the time - independent case",
    ", we expect that the number of these edge modes  counted with a sign corresponding to their chirality  is completely determined by the _ bulk _",
    "time evolution operator @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , one should be able to compute the number of chiral edge modes at quasi - energy @xmath4 given only @xmath63 .",
    "we will now construct an explicit formula , defined in terms of @xmath64 , which gives exactly this number .",
    "( here @xmath65 denotes the _ set _ of evolution operators for all times within a driving period , @xmath66 ) .",
    "our construction proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we consider the special case where the ( bulk ) floquet operator is simply the identity , i.e.  @xmath67 for all @xmath18 , as in the example described in sec .",
    "[ sec : square ] .",
    "we then generalize to arbitrary floquet operators .",
    "if the floquet operator is the identity , then the floquet spectrum is gapped everywhere except at @xmath5 . therefore , to each @xmath65 we should be able to unambiguously associate an integer @xmath68 which counts the number of edge modes propagating across the gap ( i.e.  winding around the quasi - energy brillouin zone ) .",
    "furthermore , this integer must be invariant under smooth deformations of @xmath62 that preserve the condition @xmath67 , since the number of edge modes can not change under a deformation in which the gap remains open .",

    "<S> recently , several authors have investigated topological phenomena in periodically - driven systems of non - interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena are identified through analogies between the floquet spectra of driven systems and the band structures of static hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , these works have revealed phenomena which can not be characterized by analogy to the topological classification framework for static systems . in particular , in driven systems in two dimensions ( 2d ) , robust chiral edge states can appear even though the chern numbers of all the bulk floquet bands are zero . </S>",
    "<S> here we elucidate the crucial distinctions between static and driven 2d systems , and construct a new topological invariant that yields the correct edge state structure in the driven case . </S>",
    "<S> we provide formulations in both the time and frequency domains , which afford additional insight into the origins of the `` anomalous '' spectra which arise in driven systems . </S>",
    "<S> possibilities for realizing these phenomena in solid state and cold atomic systems are discussed .    the discovery of the quantized hall effect@xcite revealed the existence of a powerful new class of extremely robust quantum phenomena which can be observed with high fidelity , largely independent of sample size , shape , and composition , up to macroscopic ( millimeter ) scales . </S>",
    "<S> the robust nature of these phenomena can be linked to the presence of energy gaps for bulk excitations , combined with the existence of nontrivial topological structures associated with the systems ground state wave functions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , these ideas were used to predict the existence of new classes of materials@xcite , the topological insulators , which were found experimentally@xcite shortly thereafter .    </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , a wide variety of new experimental tools has been developed for actively controlling and probing the behavior of electronic , cold - atomic , and purely photonic systems . for cold atoms , </S>",
    "<S> various methods have been proposed for creating `` synthetic gauge fields , '' which mimic the effects of magnetic fields@xcite or spin - orbit coupling@xcite for neutral atoms . </S>",
    "<S> several groups have also suggested the possibility of using microwave and optical techniques in solids to realize topologically non - trivial effective band structures in `` trivial '' materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> topological phenomena have been identified for strongly driven@xcite or dissipative quantum systems@xcite as well . </S>",
    "<S> analogues of topological phenomena in driven systems have even recently been observed in photonic experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these advances motivate the detailed study of topological phenomena in periodically - driven systems .    here </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention on topological features of the single - particle properties of two - dimensional translationally - invariant tight binding systems . in the static case , where the hamiltonian is constant in time , </S>",
    "<S> the topological properties of these systems are well understood . </S>",
    "<S> when no additional symmetries are present , a complete topological characterization is provided by the set of values of an integer topological invariant , the chern number , evaluated for each band@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most striking applications of this topological characterization is to the edge physics of these systems . in a finite geometry with an edge </S>",
    "<S> , a two - dimensional system may support chiral edge modes which propagate at energies within a bulk band gap . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the values of the chern numbers can be used to predict the net number of chiral edge modes traversing each bulk gap ( counted according to their chirality ) . </S>",
    "<S> this edge state count is significant because it is a robust property which is independent of the fine details of the system and of the edge . in the case of the quantized hall effect </S>",
    "<S> , the guaranteed existence of these modes provides a powerful framework for explaining a variety of complex phenomena@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given the power of this approach , we seek to generalize these results to periodically driven systems . </S>",
    "<S> in the driven case , the analogue of the energy spectrum is the floquet spectrum  </S>",
    "<S> the set of eigenvalues of the time evolution operator , evaluated over one complete cycle of driving . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the unitary evolution operator are unit modulus complex numbers , which are defined on a _ </S>",
    "<S> circle_. we express them in terms of a `` quasi - energy '' @xmath0 as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the driving period . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is thus @xmath3-periodic in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> there are many close analogies between static and periodically - driven systems . in particular , the floquet spectrum can be organized into quasi - energy bands with associated chern numbers , just as in the static case . </S>",
    "<S> also , driven systems may exhibit chiral edge modes when defined in a finite geometry with a boundary . despite these similarities , </S>",
    "<S> however , the chern numbers employed in the static case do _ not _ give a full characterization of the topological properties of periodically driven systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for driven systems , these invariants do not uniquely determine the number of chiral edge modes within each bulk band gap .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , new types of edge modes , which can not be accounted for using the invariants developed for static systems , were discovered in the floquet spectra of one and two dimensional periodically - driven systems@xcite . a schematic picture showing an example of such `` anomalous '' edge modes in a two - band two - dimensional system is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] . here , </S>",
    "<S> two sets of co - propagating chiral edge modes are found , despite the fact that the chern numbers associated with both bands are zero . </S>",
    "<S> this situation can not occur in static systems , where such edge modes are only produced at the boundaries of systems characterized by non - zero chern numbers .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we develop a more complete understanding of this behavior , and identify appropriate topological invariants ( winding numbers ) for characterizing these new phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the floquet - band chern numbers , which only depend on the evolution operator evaluated over one complete driving cycle , the winding numbers utilize the information in the evolution operator for _ all times _ within a single driving period . we show that the winding numbers fully determine the chiral edge mode counts in each of the floquet gaps . </S>",
    "<S> thus our construction provides a complete `` bulk - edge correspondence '' for periodically - driven , two dimensional , single particle systems .    </S>",
    "<S> this situation is made possible due to the periodicity of the quasi - energy @xmath4 : in addition to the edge modes which cross the gap near @xmath5 , a second branch of edge modes crosses through @xmath6 , thus connecting the top of the upper floquet band to the bottom of the lower floquet band and closing the quasi - energy cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the chern numbers correctly yield the _ differences _ between the numbers of chiral modes above and below every band , but can not be used to uniquely determine the edge state spectrum of a periodically - driven system . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",

    "<S> [ sec : failure ] gives a general discussion of the bulk edge correspondence for both static and periodically - driven systems . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : square ] we introduce a simple model of a strongly driven system , similar to the one considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , which supports a floquet band structure like the one depicted in fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then in sec .  [ sec : analysis ] we provide a general analysis and construct the winding numbers of the time - dependent evolution operator , which fully characterize the topological features of the system . </S>",
