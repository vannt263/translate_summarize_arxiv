    "in 1990 takahashi  satsuma @xcite introduced a new discrete soliton system called the box - ball system ( bbs ) .",
    "their discovery is an outcome of the effort to find a cellular automaton with solitonic behaviour , which was a rather popular subject in the 1980s , including the filter automata introduced by park  steiglitz ",
    "thurston @xcite .",
    "a state of the bbs consists of an infinite sequence of boxes where each box can accommodate at most one ball .",
    "then the time evolution rule of the bbs is described by a simple combinatorial rule in terms of the box and ball interpretation of the system .",
    "a striking feature of the bbs is that , despite its simple outlook , it exhibits all characteristic properties of solitonic systems .",
    "this remarkable property of the bbs is a sign of deep mathematical structures behind the bbs . in @xcite",
    ", the authors realized the bbs as the ultra - discrete ( or tropical ) limit of an ordinary soliton system , thereby proving the integrability of the bbs .",
    "another line of the development is the generalization of the original bbs by introducing extra degrees of freedom like spices of balls or capacity of carriers @xcite .",
    "such generalizations eventually culminated in the discovery of the connection with kashiwara s crystal bases theory @xcite of quantum affine algebras found by many authors @xcite . combining these two results ,",
    "the bbs is now understood as both a classical integrable system and a quantum integrable system .",
    "recently , yet another mathematical structure behind the bbs was revealed . in @xcite ,",
    "the inverse scattering formalism of the bbs is established with the aid of the theory of rigged configurations .",
    "rigged configurations are certain combinatorial objects originally introduced by kerov  kirillov  reshetikhin @xcite through their study of the bethe ansatz analysis for quantum spin chains . as an application ,",
    "the initial value problem of the bbs is solved @xcite including all generalizations of the bbs in @xcite .",
    "nowadays , reversing the direction of these developments , the bbs also helps to develop new mathematical theories .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the mysterious algorithm for the bijection between rigged configurations and tensor products of crystals of type @xmath0 is identified with the energy functions of crystal bases theory via the time evolution operator of the bbs .",
    "another example is that the inverse scattering formalism of the bbs gave a motivation for generalizing rigged configurations to include not only highest weight elements but also arbitrary elements in tensor products of crystals @xcite .",
    "such a generalization of the rigged configurations have also proven to be useful on representation theory side .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , the rigged configuration gives an interesting insight into the crystal structure of the kirillov  reshetikhin crystals of type @xmath1 introduced by @xcite .",
    "these developments show that the bbs is not only a model in mathematical physics but also gives a source for future mathematical theories .",
    "the aim of the present article is to propose an entirely different generalization of the bbs .",
    "as discussed above , the bbs is related with the crystal bases theory . to be more specific , the time evolution operators of the bbs",
    "is described by the combinatorial @xmath2-matrix of the crystal bases theory . in @xcite , a generalization of the type @xmath0 combinatorial @xmath2-matrix , which they called the whurl relation , are introduced through the study of networks on a cylinder .",
    "let us explain the whurl relation in more detail .",
    "the whurl relation is parametrized by vertical wires ( pointing up ) and horizontal wires ( pointing right or left ) on a cylinder .",
    "if all the horizontal wires point to the right , the whurl relation reduces to the original combinatorial @xmath2-matrices for the symmetric tensor product representation of type @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "if some of wires point to the left , the whurl relation becomes a new map satisfying the yang  baxter relation .",
    "thus we can expect that the whurl relation will generate another class of quantum integrable systems generalizing the bbs .    among the whurl relation ,",
    "the simplest possible non - trivial extension is the three horizontal wires case , where two of the wires point to the right and the other one points to the left ( see section [ sec : whurl ] ) . in the present article ,",
    "we concentrate only on this three wire case in order to clarify the most fundamental properties of the new system without getting into the technical complexities concerning the general whurl relation . in this way",
    "we stay close in spirit to the original takahashi - satsuma paper @xcite .",
    "the resulting new system , which we coin the * box - basket - ball system * ( bbbs ) , has a remarkable novel property , namely , it contains two entirely different kinds of particles whereas the bbs and its generalizations have essentially one type of particles ( of various internal degrees of freedom ) . in section [ sec : combinatorial ] , we provide a combinatorial description of the system in terms of boxes , balls and baskets , generalizing the description for the bbs . here",
    "each box or basket can accommodate at most one ball , whereas baskets can be put more than one on a box .",
    "in this sense , we can regard balls as fermionic particles and baskets as bosonic particles , together with mutual interaction between balls and baskets . in section [ sec : def_by_whurl ] , we show that this combinatorial description agrees with the definition in terms of the whurl relation . as it turns out ,",
    "the baskets originate from the wire pointing to the left in the network on the cylinder .    since the whurl relation satisfies the yang ",
    "baxter relation , we see that our bbbs is a quantum integrable system ( theorem [ quantum_integrability ] ) .",
    "however it is still a non - trivial problem to show that the bbbs is indeed a soliton system .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to show the solitonic property of the bbbs as described in theorem [ th : main ] . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", we first classify all possible solitary waves that propagate without changing their shapes if there is no scattering ( proposition [ prop : classification ] ) .",
    "a novel property is the presence of _ slow solitons_. this new kind of solitary waves are caused by a difference in the phase shifts of the scatterings for two types of velocity one solitons as described in proposition [ prop : ff ] and corollary [ cor : ss ] , respectively .",
    "finally we give a careful analysis of the general scatterings in proposition [ prop : fs ] which forms the technical heart of the present paper .",
    "we give a comment on related works . in @xcite",
    ", the authors constructed a supersymmetric extension of the bbs by using the crystal bases for the quantum superalgebra introduced by @xcite .",
    "their system is different from ours since their extension is due to the addition of fermionic particles to the original bbs whereas the bbbs is obtained by adding bosonic particles to the bbs .",
    "let us say a few words about possible future directions of the present study . recall that in the original bbs case",
    ", the solitonic property of the system is a sign of rich mathematical structures behind the model . in our bbbs case",
    ", we also established the solitonic property of the system .",
    "thus it is not unreasonable to expect that the unknown symmetry behind the general whurl relation might have deeper properties and it will be worthy to clarify such underlying symmetry behind our system .",
    "another possibility we have in mind is for engineering purposes related to transportation problems or traffic flow problems .",
    "since our system possesses obstacles described by baskets , we hope that the integrability of our system might provide some tools for detailed analysis of such problems .",
    "an alternative physical model would be waves in shallow water with some sand on the bottom .",
    "the sand represents the slow bosonic particles , while the water represents the fast fermionic particles .",
    "in @xcite takahashi and satsuma defined a discrete dynamical system exhibiting solitonic behaviour .",
    "we have a sequence of sites @xmath3 . each site",
    "@xmath4 contains one box which is either empty or has a ball inside .",
    "we denote the state of @xmath4 by a pair of numbers @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of balls in it and @xmath7 is the number of extra balls that could fit in .",
    "thus , each site is either in state @xmath8 , which we call the _ vacuum _ state , or in state @xmath9 , which we call the _ ball _ state .",
    "the notation is set up so that one could also consider the case of more than one box at a site .",
    "we shall however consider only the simple case of one box .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 for @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "time evolution of the system is as follows .",
    "the carrier travels from left ( @xmath11 ) to right ( @xmath12 ) , having an infinite capacity to carry balls .",
    "she performs the following operations at each site @xmath4 :    * if @xmath13 , she picks up this ball , changing the state into the vacuum @xmath14 ; * if @xmath14 , and she is carrying at least one ball , she drops one ball , changing the state of the site into @xmath13 .    in other words",
    ", we consider each ball from left to right ( that is , starting from @xmath15 ) and move the ball to the next available box .",
    "each ball is moved exactly once .",
    "this completes the time evolution .",
    "a _ soliton _ is a sequence of states which evolves at constant speed with no change in internal structure .",
    "basic soliton _ is a soliton @xmath16 which can not be decomposed into ( non - trivial ) solitons @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are separated by at least as many vacuum states as the speed of @xmath16 .",
    "[ thm : bb ] @xcite    1 .",

    "2 .   when a system consisting of a disjoint union of ( suitably separated )",
    "basic solitons is allowed to scatter , the outcome is a sequence of basic solitons with the same set of lengths , arranged in non - decreasing order from left to right .",
    "3 .   starting at any initial state , after a finite amount of time the system separates into basic solitons with non - decreasing length .",
    "one can also describe the action of the carrier as follows .",
    "assume the carrier is in state @xmath20 and the site she is going through is in state @xmath21 .",
    "then the new state of the carrier and the site are given by : @xmath22    it is easy to check that when @xmath23 this gives the action of the carrier described above .",
    "thus , one can assume that the carrier is originally in the state @xmath24 and acts on each site according to the transformation above .",
    "one can give a crystal base @xcite formulation of the box - ball systems @xcite ( see @xcite for a combinatorial description ) .",
    "the transformation describing the carrier action is a special case of the _ combinatorial @xmath2-matrix _ arising in the theory of crystals . in this context",
    ", states of the system are regarded as elements of tensor products of the crystals @xmath25 .    in @xcite certain birational transformations constructed from networks on oriented surfaces were considered .",
    "the tropicalization of one of these transformations turns out to be exactly the combinatorial @xmath2-matrix associated to the box - ball system .",

    "all the loops are oriented in the same direction .",

    "the time evolution can also be achieved via a carrier @xmath48 , which we think of as starting from the left , and initially carrying infinitely many boxes , no baskets , and no balls .",

    "balls and baskets are preserved , so that the resulting carrier @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 it is convenient to express the interaction of the carrier with a site as the vertex diagram :    ( 22,7 ) ( 3.5,0)@xmath56 ( 3.5,5.9)@xmath4 ( 0.6,2.9)@xmath48 ( 6.6,2.9)@xmath54 ( 0,0)(13,0)2 ( 4,1)(0,1)4.5 ( 1.7,3.2)(1,0)4.5 ( 9,3)or ( 11.5,3)@xmath57 ( 19.5,3)@xmath58 ( 15.4,5.9)@xmath59 ( 15.2,0)@xmath60    the action of the carrier can be described as follows :    * she picks up all the _ empty _ baskets at the site , and drops the baskets she was carrying before ; * then she drops as many of the balls she is carrying as she can , and picks up _ all _ the balls that were there before she dropped new ones .    initially there are @xmath61 empty baskets at the site , which implies the correctness of the rule for baskets .",
    "after the baskets are already taken care of , there are @xmath62 empty boxes and @xmath63 empty baskets at the site , and the correctness of the rule follows from the identity @xmath64    the two descriptions of the time evolution are equivalent .",
    "the stated piecewise - linear transformation can be factorized as the composition of @xmath65 and @xmath66 indeed , as remarked above @xmath67 and one needs only to plug in the expression for @xmath68 into the formulas for @xmath69 .",

    "indeed , the first transformation does not depend on and does not influence the resulting number of balls she carries , while the second transformation does not depend on and does not influence the number of baskets she carries .",
    "however , viewed independently from each other , it is clear that the two transformations accomplish exactly the combinatorial description of the time evolution .",

    "note however that there is no canonical way to reverse the unbasketing procedure .",
    "the time evolution commutes with unbasketing .",
    "in other words , applying first the time evolution in the box - basket - ball system and then unbasketing gives the same result as first applying unbasketing and then applying the time evolution in the box - ball system .",
    "the action of the carrier in the box - basket - ball system can be equivalently described the following way :    * consider the empty baskets standing at the end of the unbasketing of a site @xmath4 as the beginning of the unbasketing of @xmath47 ; * move the balls one by one left to right to the first unoccupied position ; * rearrange boxes and baskets without moving balls so that we get the correct unbasketing of the new state .",
    "if we ignore the partitioning into sites in box - basket - ball system , as well as stop distinguishing between baskets and boxes , we are left only with the second step which is exactly the time evolution of the box - ball system .",
    "start with the state @xmath76 where the sites not shown are vacuum .",
    "its unbasketing is @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes a ball and @xmath79 denotes a vacuum state , and the sites not shown are vacuum states . if we apply the time evolution to the original state we obtain @xmath80 with unbasketing @xmath81 .",
    "it is easily checked that this unbasketing is obtained from the original one by the time evolution of box - ball system .",

    "we first remark that assuming lemma [ lem : phase](1 ) , we can show that at integral times a special basket is always one site behind its paired slow ball before activation , and at the same site as its paired slow ball after activation .",

    "the remainder of the fast balls , including any originally slow balls ( now renamed as fast ) which are paired with the activated special baskets in the second step or with newly activated special baskets in the third step will begin to fill up baskets labeled @xmath213 and so on .",

    "in the final step it is possible for a slow ball to end up in a basket rather than box ; and in the earlier steps it is possible for balls to end up in boxes rather than baskets . these exceptions do not affect the result of lemma [ lem : interval ] and [ lem : phase ] .",
    "at time ( c ) , every occupied special basket which has been activated will now be emptied  the original paired slow ball ( now designated a fast ball ) has left the site , and the slow ball inside the special basket can be placed into the box .",
    "this shows that lemma [ lem : interval](1,2 ) holds at all times .",
    "lemma [ lem : interval](3 ) also holds since the number of fast balls remain constant , and they will come out all consecutive .",
    "lemma [ lem : phase](1,2,3 ) all follow from the above discussion . for ( 3 ) , one just notes that the slow ball is always one ahead ( at integral time ) of the paired special basket before activation , and always in the same site after activation .",
