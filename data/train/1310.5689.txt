    "in recent years the effective field theory approach to quantum hadrodynamic ( qhd ) has been studied extensively .",
    "the parameter set g2 @xcite , obtained from the effective field theory motivated lagrangian ( e - rmf ) approach , is very successful in reproducing the nuclear matter properties including the structure of neutron star as well as of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "this model well reproduce the experimental values of binding energy , root mean square ( rms ) radii and other finite nuclear properties @xcite . similarly ,",
    "the prediction of nuclear matter properties including the phase transition as well as the properties of compact star are remarkably good @xcite .",
    "the g2 force parameter is the largest force set available , in the relativistic mean field model .",
    "it contains almost all interaction terms of nucleon with mesons , self and cross coupling of mesons upto @xmath5 order .    in the effective field theory motivated relativistic mean field ( e - rmf ) model of furnstahl",
    "et al @xcite , the coupling of @xmath0meson is not taken into account .",
    "also , the effect of @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson cross coupling was neglected .",
    "it is soon realized that the importance of @xmath8 meson @xcite and the cross coupling of @xmath7 and @xmath9mesons @xcite can not be neglected while studying the nuclear and neutron matter properties .",
    "horowitz and piekarewicz @xcite studied explicitly the importance of @xmath6 and @xmath7 cross coupling to finite nuclei as well as to the properties of neutron star structures .",
    "this coupling also influences the nuclear matter properties , like symmetry energy @xmath10 , slope parameters @xmath11 and curvature @xmath12 of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the self- and cross couplings of @xmath7 meson plays an important role to make the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) softer .",
    "the observation of brown @xcite and later on by horowitz and piekarewicz @xcite make it clear that the neutron radius of heavy nuclei have a direct correlation with the equation of state ( eos ) of compact star matter .",
    "it is shown that the collection of neutron to proton radius difference @xmath13 using relativistic and nonrelativistic formalisms show two different patterns .",
    "unfortunately , the error bar in neutron radius makes no difference between these two pattern .",
    "therefore , the experimental result of jlab @xcite is much awaited . to have a better argument for all this , horowitz and piekarewicz @xcite introduced @xmath14 and @xmath15 couplings to take care of the skin thickness in @xmath16pb as well as the crust of neutron star .",
    "the symmetry energy , and hence the neutron radius , plays an important role in the construction of asymmetric nuclear eos .",
    "although , the new couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 take care of the neutron radius problem , the effective mass splitting between neutron and proton is not taken care . this effect can not be neglected in a highly neutron - rich dense matter system and drip - line nuclei .",
    "in addition to this mass splitting , the rms charge radius anomaly of @xmath17ca and @xmath18ca may be resolved by this scalar - isovector @xmath0meson inclusion to the e - rmf model .",
    "our aim in this paper is to see the effect of @xmath0 and @xmath19mesons couplings in a highly asymmetric system , like asymmetry finite nuclei , neutron star and asymmetric eos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first of all we extended the e - rmf lagrangian by including the @xmath0meson and the @xmath20 cross couplings .",
    "the field equations are derived from the extended lagrangian for finite nuclei .",
    "then the equation of state for nuclear matter and neutron star matters are derived .",
    "the calculated results are discussed in section iii . in this section ,",
    "we study the effect of @xmath0meson on asymmetric nuclear matter , including the neutron star .",
    "then , we adopt the calculations for finite nuclei and see the changes in binding energy , radius etc . in the last section , the conclusions are drawn .",
    "the relativistic treatment of the quantum hadrodynamic ( qhd ) models automatically include the spin - orbit force , the finite range and the density dependence of the nuclear interaction .",
    "the non - linearity of the @xmath21meson coupling included the 3-body interaction @xcite , which is currently noticed as an important ingredient for nuclear saturation .",
    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) or the e - rmf model has the advantage that , with the proper relativistic kinematics and with the meson properties already known or fixed from the properties of a small number of finite nuclei , it gives excellent results for binding energies , root - mean - square radii , quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations and other properties of spherical and deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "the quality of the results is comparable to that found in non - relativistic nuclear structure calculations with effective skyrme @xcite or gogny @xcite forces",
