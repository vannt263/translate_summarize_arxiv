    "the rapid advancement of nanotechnology drives the fabrication of structures much smaller than the mean free path of electrons as well as phonons .",
    "electronic transport on the nanoscale has been studied for over three decades and fascinating quantum effects have been observed @xcite .",
    "phonon transport on this scale is of significant interest because of the increased power dissipation in nanoelectronics , which undermines the correct functionality of devices and limit their life time @xcite . the need for better thermal conductivity has driven the search for a better understanding of thermal transport on the nanometer level .",
    "for example , the existence of a quantum of thermal conductance in mesoscopic systems has been proposed @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite . in nanowires ( width @xmath53 nm )",
    ", phonon transport is one dimensional at low temperatures due to the lateral confinement.@xcite in the ballistic limit , where the wire length is less than or equal to phonon mean free path , thermal conductance reaches to its maximum @xmath54 , which is called the quantum thermal conductance . in this limit , thermal transport",
    "is largely determined by the boundaries ( where the boundaries are defined by the geometry of the device ) , interfaces and impurities .",
    "thus , it is essential to calculate the thermal conductivity including all the details of the atomic constitutes to include the above effects .",
    "analogous nanoelectronic transport has been studied using the landauer and buttiker formalism , in which the transport is determined by the transmission probabilities @xcite .",
    "the phonon transport in these systems can also be treated by the very similar approach @xcite . in this context , the theories that was using initially in calculating electronic transmission probabilities should be applicable to phonons .",
    "for instance , the green s function approach has been successfully developed to calculate phonon transmission probabilities @xcite .",
    "r - matrix theory is a theoretical approach commonly used in nuclear and atomic physics to solve scattering problems @xcite .",
    "the first development of the r - matrix theory draws back to the work of wigner and eisenbud in nuclear scattering in 1947 .",
    "recently , this approach has been successfully developed to calculate electronic scattering in mesoscopic quantum devices @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we present the first mathematical development of the r - matrix theory to calculate phonon transmission probabilities across a device of molecular to mesoscopic scale .",
    "the key novelty of r - matrix theory for phonon is that the only required information about the scattering region is its normal modes , which is needed to evaluate only once for a system .",
    "normal modes are the collective oscillations of the lattice , which are orthonormal and form a complete basis in a finite region .",
    "these are calculated by diagonalising the dynamical matrix in the harmonic approximation of the interaction potential .",
    "the harmonic approximation is well suited to study thermal transport in mesoscopic scale systems and low temperature transport , which is not accessible by the classical molecular dynamic simulations .",
    "r - matrix theory is an efficient and simple way in calculating the phonon transmission through a nanoscale system .    this paper is structured as follows : section [ sec : model ] describes the mathematical formalism of the r - matrix theory .",
    "an introduction to the model system and the scattering picture of the lead is in section [ subsec : system ] . in section [ sec.rmat ]",
    ", we construct the phonon version of the r - matrix .",
    "then we solve for the scattering matrix ( @xmath55 ) in section [ sec : scatm ] . to validate the theory and to demonstrate the applicability",
    ", we apply the theory for two type of systems ( sec .",
    "[ application ] ) .",
    "first , we apply the theory to a one dimensional chain of atoms .",
    "then we calculate the phonon transmission through a graphene nanoribbon . in both cases",
    "we discuss the effect of mass impurities to the thermal transport and a conclusion is given in section [ conclude ] .",
    "and @xmath56 , are defined in the periodic region .",
    "the region between boundaries is the _ interior region _ and the region outside is called the _ asymptotic region_.",
    "the unit cells in the leads are depicted by the boxed regions .",
    "the lead lattice points are indexed symmetrically by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 refers to the lead @xmath59 . ]",
    "the essence of r - matrix theory is to divide the system into an _",
    "interior region_(ir ) and two or more _",
    "asymptotic regions_. the ir is the main scattering center of the system .",
    "the asymptotic regions are the semi - infinite leads connected to the ir ( fig.[uniform ] ) . in the asymptotic regions ,",
    "we assume the leads are narrow enough that the phonon transport in leads is strictly along the length direction of the leads . in the lateral direction there",
    "are confined phonon modes which is also called the phonon subbands .",
    "thus , we define a extended unit cell , depicted by the boxed regions in the fig.[uniform ] , that has the periodicity in the length direction . although r - matrix theory can handle any number of leads , for simplicity we consider the case of only two leads , while it is straight forward to generalize to a system with many leads .",
    "the ir and the leads are seperated by a set of boundaries in the periodic region , which we denote by @xmath60 .",

    "the transmission probability of a phonon of angular frequency @xmath70 from lead @xmath64 to @xmath65 is given by @xmath71 .    since the leads are periodic there are well - defined phonons in each lead .",
    "the details of the phonons can be obtained solving the dynamical equation , @xmath72 over a unit cell , where the dynamical matrix @xmath19 is , @xmath73 in the harmonic limit , force constants can be calculated by , @xmath74 which is evaluated at the equilibrium positions of atoms .",

    "there are @xmath50 phonon branches in each lead , where @xmath21 is the number of atoms in the unit cell .",
    "we can construct a scattering solution in the leads with these phonon modes . the scattering solution is comprised of three components : the incoming wave , reflected wave and transmitted wave .",

    "we assume all the scattering processes are elastic and the anharmonic interactions are neglected . as we defined our leads symmerically , the incoming waves are going at the direction of decreasing the lead lattice index @xmath57 and the scattered waves ( both reflected and transmitted ) are going at the increasing direction of the lattice index .",
    "thus , the incident and scattered components of the scattering solution can be written in terms of plane waves as , @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively , where @xmath87 is a vector whose entries are the values of @xmath88 of all the atoms in a unit cell . now",

    "the scattering amplitude in branch @xmath24 lead @xmath14 is given by @xmath91 , which is a complex number .",
    "the scattering amplitudes form a @xmath92 scattering matrix @xmath93 , where the @xmath22 is the number of phonon branches at frequency ( @xmath23 ) .",

    ", we can calculate the transmission probabilities .",
    "the transmission probability is the ratio of the energy fluxes carried by each vibrational wave .",
    "the transmission probability from branch @xmath84 in lead @xmath83 to branch @xmath24 in lead @xmath96 can be expressed as , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the phonon velocity of the branch @xmath24 at frequency @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus the transmission probability from lead @xmath83 to @xmath99 is , @xmath100      the dynamics of the entire system can be described by an infinite set of coupled equations , which are usually written as matrix form , @xmath101 where @xmath9 is the identity matrix , @xmath32 is the displacement vector and @xmath12 is the mass normalized force constant matrix .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath12 can be calculated as , @xmath102 where @xmath11 refer to a common index of atoms used to label all the atoms in the system .",
    "the matrix @xmath12 can be expressed more descriptively using the block matrices : @xmath103 is defined only in the finite _ ir _ , @xmath104 is defined in the lead @xmath14 that is infinite , and @xmath105 is the coupling between the interior region and the leads .",

    "ir_.    it is natural to describe the ir by normal modes of vibrations .",
    "however , in our scattering problem the ir is connected to semi - infinite leads and thus we can not solve for the normal modes . the solution is to solve the equations of motion for a different , but related physical system . when solving the continuum schrodinger equation in a finite region , a",
    " bloch operator \" is included to solve the problem of non - hermiticity of the kinetic energy operator @xcite .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is called the  bloch hamiltonian \" , which is explicitly hermitian inside a finite region . in the phonon problem",

    "it can involve interactions of any finite range , e.g. nearest neighbor , next nearest neighbor , etc .",
    "we subtract the term @xmath110 from the both side of the eq.[eq : bigsys ] yielding , @xmath111 the matrix ( @xmath112 ) on the left is called the `` bloch dynamical matrix '' , in which the coupling between the two regions are removed .",
    "the eq.[eq : decoupled ] can be written in block matrices as follows , @xmath113 we can extract the center row of the eq.[blocheq ] , which describe the ir , @xmath114 where @xmath115 . in the ",
    "bloch dynamical matrix \" ir can be solved independently .",
    "we find eigenvalues ( @xmath116 ) and eigenvectors ( @xmath117 ) of @xmath103 according to , @xmath118 these eigenvectors are orthonormal and form a complete set as the mass normalized force constant matrix is always hermitian .",
    "a general solution in the ir can be expanded using the above eigen vectors as follows , @xmath119 by plugging this in to the left hand side of the equation ( [ eq : dcseperate ] ) yields , @xmath120 by taking the inner product with @xmath121 ( @xmath52 refers to the conjugate transpose ) we find , @xmath122 finally , the scattering solution in the ir can be expressed as , @xmath123    according to the eq.[eq : blockm ] and [ eq : lb ] , bloch operator of lead @xmath14 , @xmath124 , has infinite number of columns and @xmath125 rows , where @xmath126 is the number of atoms in the ir .",
    "however there are non - zero couplings only between a subset of atoms in the ir with a subset of atoms in the leads , in the visinity of the boundary @xmath60 .",
    "since the boundary is defined in the periodic region , we assume that the minimum size of the coupling regions to be unit cells at either side of the boundary . this is a reasonable ( but not essential ) assumption for most practical situations .",
    "therefore we can construct a matrix of dimensions @xmath127 that contains the non - zero couplings in @xmath124 .",
    "this effective part of the bloch operator is denoted by @xmath128 .",

    "these vectors can be chosen arbitrarily and a possible choice is given in appendix [ unitvec ] .",
    "the eq.[reqn ] is obtained by matching the lead solution and the interior region solution at the unit cell at @xmath63 . in general , the matching is done on the surface atoms that share the both regions .",
    "the choice of the unit cell is adapted for the convenience of explanation .",
    "this particular choice is valid for some practical cases such as zigzag graphene nanoribbons .",
    "moreover , the incorporation of unit vectors @xmath136 is not essential .",
    "it allows to calculate the matrix elements of the @xmath27 before hand so that it can be used in the scattering matrix calculation .",
    "alternatively , one can keep the summation in eq.[reqn ] only over on  @xmath20 \" and  @xmath138 \" without including the unit vectors @xmath136 and proceed .      the scattering matrix ( @xmath28 )",
    "can be obtained by plugging the explicit form of the scattering solution in the lead ( @xmath139 ) from eq.[scatsol ] in to the r - matrix equation ( [ reqn ] ) .",

    "a derivation of this is given in appendix [ solves ] .",
    "the matrices @xmath2 and @xmath4 are independent of the number of atoms in the ir .",
    "it is the r - matrix that represent the ir in the scattering calculation . in order to construct the matrices @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath27",
    ", we only need to calculate for the normal modes of the ir in the bloch dynamical matrix and the lead phonons .",
    "the appealing feature is that these details are needed to be calculated only once for a system .",
    "first , we calculated the transmission probabilities for a one dimensional germanium channel connected to silicon leads using r - matrix theory and could reproduce the results in reference @xcite which was calculated using the nonequilibrium green s function method . here , we use r - matrix theory to calculate the phonon transmission of a one - dimensional(1d ) chain of atoms that has one atom in the unit cell and investigate the effect of mass impurities to the thermal transport .",
    "in particular , we study three cases : a single mass impurity , diatomic chain , and a random mass impurity distribution connected to two semi infinite uniform leads .",
    "the atomic masses are @xmath142 for all @xmath11 and the couplig constants are given by , @xmath143 the ir of the system consists of 25 atoms .",
    "the bloch operator ( @xmath144 ) for this 1d system is a single number , which is the force constant between the atom in the boundary and the adjacent atom in the lead .",
    "we consider only the longitudinal vibrational modes .",
    "the dotted line in fig.[imp-1]a shows the transmission probability for uniform chain .",
    "it gives unit transmission for all the frequencies up to the cut off @xmath42 .",
    "mass impurity is made by changing the mass of an atom in the middle of the interior region to @xmath145 .",
    "the dashed line in fig.[imp-1]a shows the transmission probability calculated in the presence of a single mass impurity . in the semi - classical approach impurity point defect scattering",
    "is modeled by a rayleigh type expression @xcite that is proportional to @xmath146 .",
    "we observe a similar trend in the transmission probability for scattering from a single mass impurity in 1d .",
    "then we incorporate another mass of @xmath147 with the @xmath148 forming a periodic diatomic structure in the middle of the interior region .",
    "the number of unit cells included is seven .",
    "the corresponding transmission is plotted by the solid line in fig.[imp-1]a .",
    "we can see the opening of a forbidden region having zero transmission .",
    "next the above two masses are randomly distributed replacing 14 atoms in the interior region . in this case",
    "the transmission is depicted by the dotted dashed line .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     in r - matrix theory we are working on the real space displacement waves .",
    "this allows us to easily sketch the profile of the displacement waves during the scattering .",
    "this visualization is important to gain clear insight on to the scattering process and tuning the mode specific transmission of phonons . in fig.[fig.displot ] , we sketch the displacement wave in the three regions : lead 1 , interior region and lead 2 , at frequency @xmath149 @xmath150 when the mass impurity is in the center of the interior region .",
    "we use the eq.[scatsol ] for the leads and the eq.[irgsf ] for the interior region .",
    "the displacement waves in three regions matches nicely at the boundaries .",
    "there are two phonon subbands available at this frequency as shown in fig.[fig.2llm ] .",
    "the sketch in fig.[fig.displot]a is for the waves coming in mode 1 , which is the acoustic mode .",
    "we observe that the propagation of the acoustic mode is considerably attenuated with the presence of the mass impurity . in the acoustic mode , all the atoms in the unit cell vibrate in - phase .",
    "thus , the mass impurity prevent this in - phase motion .",
    "however , we observe that the twisting mode is not affected by the presence of the mass impurity in the middle as implied by the fig.[fig.displot]b .",
    "this could be attributed to the asymmetric polarization profile of the twisting mode ( mode 2 in fig.[fig.2llm ] ) .",
    "we have adapted the r - matrix theory to calculate phonon scattering on the atomic level .",
    "the major advantage of the r - matrix approach is the reduced computational time .",
    "moreover the ability to express the scattering matrix by a simple analytical expression is also an advantage of this approach as is the capability of easily plotting the scattering displacement wave .",
    "the application to devices with three or more leads is straightforward and only involves increasing the range of the lead index .",
    "we discuss results applying r - matrix theory to a 1d atomic chain and a graphene nanoribbon .",
    "we observe a lower thermal conductivity for a random distribution of masses than the periodic arrangement in a 1d atomic chain . for a single mass impurity",
    ", the profile of the transmission probability shows a trend similar to the rayleigh type scattering .",
    "however , phonon transmission through gnrs in the presence of a mass impurity shows strong dependence on the mode profile of the laterally confined vibrational modes .",
    "furthermore , there are a number of important differences between r - matrix theory for electrons and for phonons .",
    "first , because the electron case is defined over a continuous spatial degree of freedom , there are an infinite number of eigenstates of the bloch hamiltonian .",
    "this means that any solution involves a high energy cut - off given by the largest eigenvalue considered in the bloch hamiltonian . in the phonon case",
    ", there is no sense to oscillations that have a wavelength shorter than the distance between atoms in a single unit cell .",
    "therefore , there are no more than @xmath125 modes associated with the interior region , and such convergence is not an issue .",
    "the electron case also suffers convergence issues related to the choice of basis used for solutions of the bloch hamiltonian .",
    "since the scattering solution can have any amplitude and derivative on the boundary , it is important that the basis functions share the same feature .",
    "this motivates a variety of different approaches to choosing a basis , such as variational basis functions .",
    "in contrast , in the phonon case we merely solve for the normal modes of the system , and there is no such ambiguity .",
    "the electron problem has the advantage of well - defined boundaries and a clear potential energy .",
    "setting up the bloch dynamical matrix requires knowledge of the force constants ( eq.([eq : calfc ] ) ) evaluated at the equilibrium position of the atom",
    ". this may require simulating the system and allowing it to relax , minimizing the internal strain .",
    "similarly , to define the `` lead solutions '' we must assume that the lead lattices are semi - infinite and uniform .",
    "in real systems the interior region may exert a strain that distorts the leads ; the interior region must be large enough so that plane wave solutions in the leads are valid .",
    "the electronic scattering problem involves many  channels . \" in atomic physics these are usually different angular momentum states for the scattering electron , while in the mesoscopic device case they correspond to different subbands in a lead .",
    "such inter - subband scattering is present in phonons as well .",
    "electronic _ interband _",
    "transitions require a periodic lattice potential in the leads and/or the interior region , so that it is meaningful to discuss electron bands .",
    "the phonon system may also have different bands if the unit cell has a multi - atom basis .",
    "this opens up the possibility of phonon transduction , where optical phonons can be turned into acoustic phonons and vice versa , through the suitable design of an interior region .",

    "<S> we have adapted r - matrix theory to calculate phonon scattering across systems of molecular to mesoscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the key novelty of this work is that the only required information about the scattering region are its normal modes , which are evaluated only once for a system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , r - matrix theory is a computationally efficient and simple approach to calculate phonon scattering in larger systems . to validate and to demonstrate the applicability of the theory </S>",
    "<S> , we apply it to two systems : a one dimensional chain of atoms and a graphene nanoribbon . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effect of mass impurities on thermal transport . </S>"
