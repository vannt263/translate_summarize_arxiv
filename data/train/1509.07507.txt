    "therefore , we measure the parallaxes only for the first three sources using the procedure developed in the torino observatory parallax program described in @xcite .",
    "this has been adapted to the format of the vvv data products ( coordinates and photometry ) delivered by casu .",
    "a detailed description of the parallax code can be found in that paper , and we give here only a brief description of the steps involved . for the purpose of the astrometric reduction , we selected reference stars in a circle of radius 1  around the target which , given the high stellar density in these fields , provides an adequate number of reference stars ( above a hundred sources ) .",
    "these were selected among the highest s / n objects in the field of view , satisfying the condition that they appear in at least 80% of the frames , and do not exhibit large proper - motions .",
    "for example , for 2mass 15464497 - 5254371 the initial number of reference stars was 189 , but in the end only 121 of these were used to build the astrometric reference frame . in total",
    "we had 70 vvv images in @xmath16 , at various epochs ( see figure [ fig : par ] ) , spanning more than 3 years .",

    "this led to high centroiding errors and a sparse reference star set of only 41 and 55 objects for the two fields respectively .",
    "the two parallax solutions were therefore completely independent with different reference fields and with observations from different vircam chips .",
    "each observation has a quote positional error from the vista pipeline but there is a significant fraction of the total that is systematic in nature from transforming the observations to a common system .",
    "for this reason when calculating the errors of the derived parallax we do not use the individual observation errors .",
    "the final quote errors on the target parameters are obtained from the covariance matrix of the solution scaled by the error of unit weight .",
    "the observations used in the sequence are selected using the standard outlier rejection criteria developed in the torino program following these two criteria : 1 ) the average per coordinate error of the reference stars in a frame must be less than the mean error of all frames plus three standard deviations about the mean ; 2 ) the combined observed - minus - computed coordinate residual of each observation must be less than three times the sigma of the whole solution . the objects 2mass j15464497 - 5254371 , 2mass j14035016 - 5923426 and 2mass j14040025 - 5923551 had 4 , 2 and 2 observations rejected respectively by these criteria .",
    "extensive bootstrap - like testing was carried out on the observations to make sure the results were robust .",
    "this consisted of iterating through each observation and using as the primary base frame and thus making a solution that that incorporated slightly different sets of reference stars and a different starting point within the sequence .",
    "the solution chosen for publication is that one which is closest to the median of all solutions .",
    "the majority of the solutions ( @xmath1790@xmath7 ) were all within one sigma of the chosen solution .",

    "it is also important to emphasize the relevance of obtaining distances or spectral types for discriminating chance alignments from real wide binaries ( or co - moving stars ) , even when the proper motion and position probabilities are very low we show two examples in this paper where the hypothesized binaries are most likely not physically related .",
    "we also discussed a likely microlensing event due to a star passing in front of a background galaxy .",
    "the number of predicted microlensing events of this type will be more frequent as more hpm low mass objects are found in high density environments like the galactic bulge and inner disk , but also with background galaxies . although the lens candidate we present here is not predicted to pass in front of the center of the galaxy the event can be used to study the lens for unresolved companions and planets . in this case",
    "this maybe particularly difficult as the lens goes through different parts of the galaxy in short time scales magnifying regions of intrinsically different brightness .",
    "these events can also be used to make more detailed structural studies of galaxies at low redshift .",
