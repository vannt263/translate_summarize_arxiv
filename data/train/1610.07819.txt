    "it is widely accepted that an accreting black hole ( bh ) of an arbitrary size can produce a pair of relativistic plasma jets , which are often observed in various wavelengths from radio to very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays .",
    "the most plausible mechanism for powering such jets is the extraction of the bh rotational energy through the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite . in this electromagnetic process ,",

    ", general relativistic ( gr ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models show the existence of nearly steady , collimated , magnetically dominated jets in the polar regions @xcite , whose structures are similar to those in the force - free models @xcite .",
    "since the centrifugal - force barrier prevents plasma accretion towards the rotation axis , the magnetic energy density dominates the plasmas rest - mass energy density in these polar funnels .",
    "even if the axial funnels are almost force - free in this sense , it is the electric current that sustains the electromagnetic power , and it is the charged particles that carry the electric current .",
    "that is , even under the assumption of masslessness , it must be the real charged particles that constitute the electric currents . in the direct vicinity of the horizon",
    ", causality requires that positive ( or negative ) charges must flow into the horizon when an electric current flows into ( or out from ) the horizon . since accreting plasmas",
    "can not easily penetrate into the funnels , and since they can not emit sufficient mev photons that are capable of materializing as electron - positron pairs when the accretion rate is very low , we need a process of plasma supply deep within the magnetosphere somewhere above the horizon .    to contrive a plasma source in the vicinity of the horizon",

    "however , the predicted @xmath0-ray luminosity was too small to be detected by any instruments , because they assumed a substantial accretion rate ( as in quasars ) , which leads to a very thin gap width along the magnetic field lines .    on these grounds",
    ", @xcite and @xcite revisited the bh gap model and applied it the central bh of radio galaxy m87 ( i.e. , m87 * ) and srg  a * , adopting a much thicker gap width as large as the horizon radius .",
    "their assumption of a thick gap was , indeed , reasonable , because such a low luminosity active galactic nucleus generally possesses a less dense radiation field in the center and hence a geometrically extended gap slightly above the horizon .",

    "then they applied their bh - gap model to the radio galaxy ic310 , whose central bh ( i.e. , ic310 * ) is accreting plasmas at much smaller rate than the eddington rate .",
    "they demonstrated that the gap width becomes as large as the horizon radius when the accretion rate is very low , and that the observed vhe flux during the flare can not be reproduced by their bh gap model , unless the magnetic field becomes much stronger than the equipartition value with the plasma accretions . noting that gr effects most importantly appear in the formation of the null - charge surface through frame dragging",
    ", they evaluated the gj charge density general relativistically .",
    "however , they neglected the gr effects in any other terms of the basic equations as the first step , because the electromagnetic interaction dominates the gravitational one except for the direct vicinity of the horizon , and because the photons emitted from the horizon vicinity will not strongly affect the emission spectra due to redshift .    in the present paper , to further quantify the gap model , we include the gr effects in all the basic equations and calculations , extending the method of hp16 . in the next section ,",
    "we examine the detectability of bh gap emissions for various bh masses .",
    "then in   [ sec : geometry ] , we describe the background space time and derive the gr gj charge density in a rotating bh magnetosphere .",
    "we then formulate the basic equations of gap electrodynamics in   [ sec : accelerator ] , and investigate their emission properties in   [ sec : solutions ] . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss how to discriminate the gap emission from the jet emission .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : pois ] ) gives a stationary gap solution in the co - rotational frame , in the sense that @xmath77 and @xmath70 are a function of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath76 .",
    "note that such stationary solutions are valid not only between the two light surfaces ( i.e. , where @xmath91 ) , but also inside the inner light surface and outside the outer light surface ( i.e. , where @xmath92 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pois ] ) shows that @xmath93 is exerted along @xmath94 if @xmath70 deviates from @xmath95 in any region . in the close vicinity of the inner and outer boundaries",
    ", we can neglect the trans - field derivatives to obtain @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath97 , and hence @xmath98 must have different signs at the two boundaries so that the gap may be closed .",
    "in a nearly vacuum gap , @xmath99 shows that @xmath95 should change sign within the gap .",
    "therefore , a gap should appear around the null - charge surface , where @xmath95 vanishes .",
    "the null surface is , therefore , a natural place for a particle accelerator ( i.e. , a gap ) to arise , in the same way as pulsar vacuum gap models @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the null surface appears * near * the place where @xmath21 coincides with the space - time dragging angular frequency , @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the deviation of the null surface from this @xmath101 surface is , indeed , small , as figure  1 of @xcite indicates .",
    "since @xmath100 matches @xmath21 only near the horizon , the null surface , and hence the gap generally appears within one or two gravitational radii above the horizon , irrespective of the bh mass .",
    "in this section , we formulate the bh - gap electrodynamics , extending the method described in @xcite and hp16 . throughout this paper , we assume an aligned rotator in the sense that the magnetic axis coincides with the rotational axis of the bh , and seek an axisymmetric solution .      as described in hp16 , a stationary bh gap is formed around the null surface , as long as the injected current density across the inner or outer boundaries is much small compared to the gj value .",
    "since the null surface is formed by the frame - dragging effect , the gap electrodynamics is essentially governed by the frame - dragging effect rather than the magnetic field configurations .",
    "this forms a striking contrast to the pulsar outer - magnetospheric gap model , in which the null surface is formed by the convex geometry of the poloidal magnetic field lines .",
    "thus , in a bh magnetosphere , the gap position and its spatial extent , as well as the exerted @xmath102 in the gap , little depend on the magnetic flux function , @xmath103 .",
    "we thus assume a radial magnetic field on the poloidal plane , @xmath104 .",
    "because of axial symmetry , the gap electrodynamic structure can be described in the poloidal plane . for simplicity , we assume that the photons propagate radially in this 2-d plane , which is justified if the photons have negligible angular momenta . provided that the drift motion ( e.g. , due to toroidal radiation drag in a radial magnetic field , or due to radial gravity in a toroidal magnetic field ) is small in the meridional direction , charged particles roughly move along the magnetic field lines in the poloidal plane . in this case ,",
    "due to relativistic beaming , ultra - relativistic particles emit photons along the instantaneous magnetic field lines ; thus , as long as the poloidal magnetic field is radial , photons propagate on the same magnetic flux surface , @xmath105 . as a result",
    ", we can solve the particle equations of motion and the radiative transfer equation along individual radial poloidal magnetic field lines separately .",
    "even when the magnetic field lines are radial in the poloidal plane , there exists a toroidal magnetic component , @xmath106 , due to retardation , magnetospheric currents , and a frame dragging .",
    "it is , however , out of the scope of this paper to restrict the functional form of @xmath107 , taking account of such effects .",
    "in addition , @xmath106 does not affect @xmath95 or the propagation direction of particles and photons in the poloidal plane .",
    "thus , we do not specify @xmath106 .",
    "accordingly , instead of computing the curvature radius , @xmath108 , of the leptons from their 3-d motion in the rotating magnetosphere , we parameterize @xmath108 when we calculate the curvature emission .",
    "although @xmath108 affects the spectral shape of curvature emission , it little affects the total luminosity , because the latter is essentially determined by the potential drop within the gap , and because the potential drop is determined by the gap width , which is in turn predominantly determined by the pair production rate of the ic - emitted , vhe photons ( not the curvature - emitted , lower energy photons ) . on these grounds ,",
    "we adopt @xmath109 in the present paper , leaving @xmath106 unconstrained .      in the same way as hp16",
    ", we solve the stationary gap solution from the set of the poisson equation for @xmath77 , the equations of motion for electrons and positrons , and the radiative transfer equation for the emitted photons .      to solve the radial dependence of @xmath77 in the poisson equation  ( [ eq : pois ] )",
    ", we introduce the following dimensionless tortoise coordinate , @xmath110 , @xmath111 in this coordinate , the horizon corresponds to the inward infinity , @xmath112 . in this paper",

    "the distribution of @xmath110 is depicted as a function of @xmath116 in figure  [ fig : tortois ] .",
    "note that the relationship between @xmath110 and @xmath65 does not depend on the colatitude , @xmath66 .",
    "since the gap is located near the horizon , we take the limit @xmath117 . assuming that @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath76 , that is , @xmath118",
    ", we can recast the poisson equation  ( [ eq : pois ] ) into the two - dimensional form , @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the dimensionless non - corotational potential .",
    "dimensionless lepton densities per magnetic flux tube are defined by @xmath121 where the number densities of positrons and electrons , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are computed from the pair production rate at each position @xcite .",
    "dimensionless gj charge density per magnetic flux tube is defined by @xmath124    for a radial poloidal magnetic field , @xmath104 , we can compute the acceleration electric field by @xmath125 without loss of any generality , we can assume @xmath126 in the northern hemisphere . in this case , a negative @xmath26 arises in the gap , which is consistent with the direction of the global current flow pattern .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : def_gj ] ) shows that @xmath95 is essentially determined by @xmath127 , rather than @xmath128 , near the horizon . in a stationary and axisymmetric magnetosphere ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : def_gj ] ) becomes @xmath129 where @xmath130 . since @xmath8 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132",
    "are well - behaved at the horizon , we find that the second term dominates the first one at @xmath133 . therefore , although the null surface itself is formed by the _ frame - dragging _ effect , the radial component of the magnetic field essentially determines @xmath95 near the horizon owing to the _ redshift _ effect .",
    "we next consider @xmath134 and @xmath135 in equation  ( [ eq : pois_3 ] ) . because of @xmath136",
    ", electrons are accelerated outwards , while positrons inwards .",
    "as s result , as long as there is no current injection across either outer or inner boundaries , charge density , @xmath137 , becomes negative ( or positive ) at the outer ( or inner ) boundary .",
    "in a stationary gap , @xmath26 should not change sign in it . in a vacuum gap",
    ", a positive ( or a negative ) @xmath138 near the outer ( or inner ) boundary makes @xmath139 ( or @xmath140 ) , thereby closing the gap . in a non - vacuum gap",
    ", the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : pois_3 ] ) should become positive ( or negative ) near the outer ( or inner ) boundary so that the gap may be closed .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 should not exceed @xmath142 at either boundary . at the outer boundary , for instance",
    ", we can put @xmath143 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath144 should be in the range , @xmath145 , so that the gap solution may be stationary .",
    "since @xmath126 is assumed , it is enough to consider a positive @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath146 , there is no surface charge at the outer boundary .",
    "however , if @xmath147 , the surface charge results in a jump of @xmath97 at the outer boundary .",
    "that is , the parameter @xmath144 specifies the strength of @xmath97 at the outer boundary .",
    "thus , the inner boundary position , @xmath148 , is determined as a free boundary problem by this additional constraint , @xmath144 .",
    "the outer boundary position , @xmath149 , or equivalently the gap width @xmath150 , is constrained by the gap closure condition (   [ sec : closure ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the charge conservation ensures that the dimensionless current density ( per magnetic flux tube ) , @xmath151 conserves along the flowline . at the outer boundary ,",
    "we obtain @xmath152 thus , @xmath144 specifies not only @xmath97 at the outer boundary , but also the conserved current density , @xmath153 .    in general , under a given electro - motive force exerted in the ergosphere , @xmath153 should be constrained by the global current flow pattern , which includes an electric load at the large distances where the force - free approximation breaks down and the trans - magnetic - field current gives rise to the outward acceleration of charged particles by lorentz forces ( thereby converting the poynting flux into particle kinetic energies ) .",
    "however , we will not go deep into the determination of @xmath153 in this paper , because we are concerned with the acceleration processes near the horizon , not the global current closure issue .",

    ". it may be worth mentioning , in passing , that we may not have to consider a time - dependent solution , which may be obtained when @xmath157 as in pulsar polar - cap models @xcite . in the polar cap model , the absence of the null surface results in a non - stationary gap solution @xcite .",
    "however , in the pulsar outer gap models @xcite or in the present bh gap model , the existence of the null surface leads to a formation of a stationary gap around this surface .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath145 and consider a stationary gap solution .",
    "let us describe the motion of electrons and positrons . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the distribution functions of electrons and positrons are mono - energetic .",
    "we evaluate the lorentz factors of electrons ( or positron ) by the motion of a test particle injected across the inner ( or the outer ) boundary of the gap .",
    "for example , an injected test electron is accelerated by a negative @xmath26 outwards and loses the kinetic energy via curvature and ic processes . the former , curvature radiation rate ( per particle ) is computed by the standard synchrotron emission formula with the gyration radius replaced with @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the latter , ic radiation rate is computed by multiplying the scattering probability ( per unit time ) and the scattered photon energy .",
    "thus , the particle lorentz factor saturates at the curvature- or ic - limited value , whichever smaller .      throughout this paper",
    ", we assume that all photons are emitted with vanishing angular momenta . in this case , photons propagate on a constant-@xmath66 surface ; thus , the radiative transfer equation is solved one - dimensionally along the radial magnetic field lines on the poloidal plane .",

    "some portions of the photons are emitted above 10  tev via ic process .",
    "a significant fraction of such hard @xmath0-rays are absorbed , colliding with the riaf soft photons .",
    "if such collisions take place within the gap , the created electrons and positrons polarize to be accelerated in opposite directions , becoming the primary leptons .",
    "if the collisions take place outside the gap , the created , secondary pairs migrate along the magnetic filed lines to emit photons via ic and synchrotron processes .",
    "some of such secondary ic photons are absorbed again to materialize as tertiary pairs , which emit tertiary photons via synchrotron and ic processes , eventually cascading into higher generations .",
    "as a representative model of the riaf , we adopt the analytic solution of the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) obtained by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the adaf soft photon specific intensity is isotropic in the zero - angular - momentum observer ( zamo ) .",

    "@xmath162 , we assume that their number density decreases by @xmath163 law .",
    "this treatment may be justified , because the submillimeter - ir photons , which most effectively work both for pair production and ic scatterings , are emitted from the inner - most region of the adaf .",

    "[ fig : seda_12rg_1e9 ] ]      finally , we apply the method to various bh masses from @xmath348 to @xmath349 , the filled circles in figure  [ fig : mdot ] denote the solved @xmath350 for @xmath34 .",

    "we fit the filled circles in figure  [ fig : mdot ] with a straight line by least square method to obtain @xmath352 .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath353 , of a bh gap , could be estimated by substituting this @xmath354 into @xmath355 , where equation  ( [ eq : l_bz_2 ] ) is used .",
    "the factor @xmath356 comes from the fact that the gap luminosity can attain at most @xmath357  % of @xmath30 , because @xmath26 is partly screened by the created pairs within the gap , and because a stationary gap solution can possess only a sub - gj current density .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the bh - gap solution at such a low @xmath12 corresponds to the case of the middle - aged pulsars whose outer - gap luminosity attains at most 30  % of the spin - down luminosity from the same reasons @xcite .",
    "if we artificially change @xmath346 , we can consider the impact of the adaf photon field density , without changing @xmath9 at the same @xmath12 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdot ] , we plot the @xmath358 for @xmath359 as the open squares .",
    "it follows that the reduction of the soft photon field ( by doubling @xmath346 ) changes the gap solution to some extent , because it affects the pair production process in the gap .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mdot ] we also plot a slower bh spin , @xmath360 as the open circles .",
    "it follows that @xmath350 has a weak dependence on @xmath187 due to the negative feedback effect @xcite . to further constrain @xmath350 , we need to specify the specific intensity of the riaf ( e.g. , adaf ) photon field near the horizon by numerical computation .",

    "to sum up , we have solved stationary lepton accelerators ( or gaps ) in the magnetospheres of rotating black holes with arbitrary masses . by solving the set of an inhomogeneous part of the maxwell equations , lepton equations of motion , and the radiative transfer equation ,",
    "we demonstrate that an electric field arises along the magnetic field line around the null charge surface on which the frame - dragging angular frequency coincides with the magnetic - field angular frequency . in the gap ,",
    "electrons and positrons are created via two - photon collisions and accelerated in opposite directions by the acceleration electric field into ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "such leptons emit copious @xmath0-rays via curvature and inverse - compton ( ic ) processes , leading to a pair - production cascade inside and outside the gap .",
    "the gap longitudinal width is self - regulated so that a single electron eventually cascade into a single pair within the gap , and approximately coincides with the mean - free path ( for an ic photon to materialize via two - photon collision ) divided by the number of ic photons emitted by a single electron . as the accretion rate decreases , the increased mean - free path results in an extended gap , and hence an increased luminosity .",
    "the gap luminosity maximizes when the gap width becomes much greater than the horizon radius . for stellar - mass bhs",
    ", we can expect that their curvature emission are detectable with _ fermi_/lat and the ic emission with _ cta _",
    ", when the bh binary is in a quiescent state , provided that the distance is within several kpc . for super - massive bhs",
    ", their ic emission may be marginally detectable with _ cta _ for low luminosity agn , if their distances are within a few tens of mpc .      in the present work",
    ", there are mainly two improvements from hp16 , which formulated a bh gap model and applied it to the radio galaxy ic310 .",
    "first , in the present work , the poisson equation  ( [ eq : pois ] ) is solved general - relativistically on the poloidal plane . however , in hp16 , the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : pois ] ) was approximated one - dimensionally in the newtonian limit .",
    "second , in the present work , @xmath362 ( in the poisson equation ) is solved from the local pair production rate in a consistent manner with the radiative transfer equation .",
    "however , hp16 assumed that @xmath363 changes linearly with @xmath65 ( see their eq .",
    "both above - mentioned simplifications suppress @xmath26 to some extent , comparing the gr treatment . to compare the difference",
    ", we apply the present 2-d , gr method to ic310 , assuming @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : seda_ic310 ] show the resultant sed , where the parameter set is basically the same as hp16 ; namely , we adopt @xmath293 and @xmath364 . comparing with figure  13 of hp16 , which was obtained for @xmath18",
    ", we find that the 1-d newtonian approximation in hp16 underestimated the gap luminosity about @xmath365 times from the present 2-d gr treatment .",
    ", is assumed to compare with figure  13 ( @xmath18 case ) of hp16 .",
    "the cyan , blue , green , and black curves correspond to @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , and @xmath340 , respectively .",
    "the black triangles and squares show the observed fluxes in the low and high states @xcite respectively , while the red circles do those in the flaring state @xcite .",
    "the observed vhe fluxes are corrected for the absorption by the extragalactic background light .",
    "the solid bowtie represents the x - ray fluxes obtained by re - analyzing the observational data taken with _",
    "xmm - newton _ in 2003 , _ chandra _ in 2004 , and _ swift _ in 2007 @xcite .",
    "the dotted bowtie represents the re - analyzed data of _ chandra _ in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the open circles denote the _ fermi_/lat spectrum .",
    "[ fig : seda_ic310 ] ]      we have assumed that @xmath81 is constant along each magnetic field line .",
    "however , @xmath21 is not conserved when the electric potential drop along the magnetic field line becomes a non - negligible fraction of the electro - motive force exerted across the horizon .",
    "nevertheless , for all the cases in the present paper , the gap luminosity is less than two percent of the blandford - znajek power . noting that the particle energy is predominantly converted into radiation within the gap",
    ", we can conclude that the deviation of @xmath21 from a constant value ( e.g. , @xmath366 ) is at most a few percent .",
    "thus , the assumption of a constant @xmath21 along each magnetic field line is mostly justified .",
    "it is worth comparing the gap position with the separation surface where both inflows and outflows start without @xmath26 .",
    "since the plasma particles will not be accelerated either outward or inward at this surface , the sum of the gravitational , lorentz and centrifugal forces will vanish along the magnetic field lines there .",
    "one of the convenient ways to find such a surface is to put both @xmath367 and @xmath368 in the poloidal wind equation of mhd @xcite , where @xmath369 refers to the poloidal velocity of the fluid .",
    "note that this mhd argument is valid in the magnetically dominated limit , which is close to ( but not equal to ) the force - free limit .    in a stationary and axisymmetric bh magnetosphere",
    ", the separation surface is determined by the condition @xmath370 in mhd ( see end of   [ sec : geometry ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the prime denotes the derivative along the poloidal magnetic field line .",
    "for a radial poloidal field lines , @xmath371 attains its maximum value @xmath372 , @xmath373 , @xmath374 , and @xmath375 at @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 , and @xmath379 , along the field lines at @xmath380 , @xmath197 , @xmath199 , and @xmath381 , respectively .",
    "thus , the separation surface is approximately located at @xmath382 at @xmath383 . as for the gap position ,",
    "figures  [ fig : e2d_1e1 ] , [ fig : e2d_th_1e1 ] , and [ fig : e2d_1e9 ] show that @xmath384 distribution , and hence the gap longitudinal extent little depends on @xmath66 , except near the meridional boundary , @xmath385 . thus , near the magnetic pole ( e.g. , @xmath386 ) , the separation surface is generally located outside the gap ( figs  [ fig : width_1e1 ] & [ fig : width_1e9 ] ) .",
    "this conclusion little depends on the poloidal magnetic field structure , because the gap solution is essentially determined by the @xmath95 distribution , which is governed by the radial component of the magnetic field near the horizon ( eq .  [ eq : rhogj_2 ] ) and because the separation surface distribution has a weak dependence on the poloidal field structure as well ( fig .  2 of hp16 ) .",
    "if a plasma fluid begins to flow with @xmath387 from the separation surface , the plasma particles are accelerated up to the lorentz factor of a few by the mhd interaction ( e.g. , eq",
    ".  5.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the electron - positron pairs that cascaded from outward - propagating pev @xmath0-rays have typical lorentz factors @xmath388 ( for stellar - mass bhs ) .",
    "thus , such pairs continue their outward motion across the separation surface , climbing up the hill of the mhd effective potential @xmath371 ( fig .  2 of hp16 ) very easily . in another word ,",
    "the large charge - to - mass ratio of the electron makes the electrostatic acceleration dominate the mhd acceleration , which is comparable to the centrifugal or gravitational one . only in the direct vicinity of the horizon",
    ", the plasma mass and the causality at the horizon makes the gravitational interaction overcome the electromagnetic one . in another word , we can forget about the separation surface when we consider the formation of a gap in a bh magnetosphere .",
    "it is worth noting that the above - mentioned mhd separation surface is distinct from what is argued in recent mhd simulations . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the flow density decreases to zero at a specific surface , which requires an imposition of density floors. without the density floors , a vacuum would develop in the funnel .",
    "however , such a limitation of numerical mhd has nothing to do with the gap formation discussed in the present paper .",
    "let us discuss what is expected when @xmath12 becomes even less than @xmath350 .",
    "the adaf photon field peaks around ev for stellar - mass bhs and around mev for super - massive bhs .",
    "these photons are emitted from the inner - most region , @xmath389 , and decreases outward approximately by @xmath163 law .",
    "thus , when the gap outer boundary is located at @xmath390 , as in the case of @xmath391 , stationary pair production can be sustained only marginally in an extended gap . however , at @xmath392 , a stationary pair production can be no longer sustained and a vacuum region develops in the entire polar funnel . in this vacuum region ,",
    "migratory leptons are accelerated by the vacuum @xmath26 and cascade into copious primary electrons and positrons accelerated in opposite directions .",
    "emissions from such cascading primaries will be time - dependent and may consist of many shots , whose power spectrum density ( psd ) may show some characteristic power law . in this case",
    ", the lower cutoff frequency of the power - law psd will be given by the reciprocal of the light crossing time of the extended gap , which is much longer than the horizon - light - crossing time scale .",
    "we finally discuss how to discriminate the gap and jet emissions .",
    "it follows from figure  [ fig : seda_1e1 ] that the gap he and vhe fluxes increases with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "that is , we can predict an _ anti - correlation _ between the ir / optical and he / vhe fluxes .",
    "it forms a contrast to the standard shock - in - jet scenario , in which the ir / optical and the he / vhe fluxes will correlate .",
    "therefore , we propose to simultaneously observe nearby black hole transients during quiescence both in near - ir / optical and vhe .",
    "if their time - varying multi - wavelength spectra show anti - correlation , it strongly suggests that the photons are emitted from the bh gap . for nearby low - luminosity agns",
    ", the anti - correlation will appear between submillimeter wavelength and vhe .",
    "stellar - mass bhs exhibit the strongest gap emission in he .",
    "figure  [ fig : seda_1e1 ] shows that nearby bh transients are capable of emitting an order of magnitude greater fluxes than the lat detection limit ( with 10 years observation ) .",
    "it means that a he flare could be detected by _ lat _ if the flare lasts for a month or so , particularly for the sources located away from the galactic plane .",
