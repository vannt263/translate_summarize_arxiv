    "it has been claimed that too many subgalactic halos are formed in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe , compared to the dwarf galaxies observed in the local group @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest ways to resolve this discrepancy is the exclusion of baryonic matter from small halos by some feedback mechanisms .",
    "the mechanisms could be either the gas ejection due to energy input by the multiple supernova ( sn ) explosions @xcite or the photo - evaporation by ultraviolet background ( uvb ) radiation @xcite .",
    "as for the former process , @xcite recently performed high resolution hydrodynamic simulations and concluded that 1000 sne are required in order to disrupt a galaxy with @xmath3 at @xmath4 , while only 100 sne in the halo lead to triggering the re - collapse of the whole system .",
    "these results show that sn explosions are not always destructive for the formation of low - mass galaxies , although it depends upon the initial mass function of stars ( e.g. ricotti & ostriker 2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the previous studies on the uvb feedback have shown that the photo - evaporation by uvb is dependent upon the virial mass . as long as systems are more massive than @xmath5 ,",
    "the photo - evaporation by uvb is not effective , because deep potential wells can retain the ionized gas .",
    "however , at smaller mass - scales , the feedback by uvb is expected to play a very important role .",
    "recently , _",
    "wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) @xcite suggested that the universe was reionized in a rather early epoch ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the uvb feedback could be quite effective for low - mass systems , since density fluctuations are photo - heated before they collapse to form stars .",
    "very recently , @xcite analyzed the dynamical history of small substructure halos with present mass @xmath7 by a cosmological simulation .",
    "they found that 10% of small halos originate in considerably larger systems with @xmath8 , which survived the tidal stripping .",
    "they suggest that the galactic satellites are descendants of relatively massive systems which formed at higher redshifts and did not significantly suffer from the uvb .",
    "this argument is plausible , if systems with @xmath8 are impervious even to the early reionization , and also the star formation in low - mass systems is completely suppressed .",
    "@xcite have investigated the uvb feedback by one dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulation for halos which collapse at @xmath9 , and found that the central parts can not cool down to form stars if the virial temperature is less than @xmath10 k and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the intensity at lyman limit in units of @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 cm@xmath14 hz@xmath14 str@xmath14 .",
    "@xcite extended this work to higher redshifts by one dimensional hydrodynamic calculations , and found that gas is not photo - evaporated in halos with circular velocities of @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "but , in the hierarchical structure formation in a cold dark matter universe , three - dimensional ( 3d ) time - dependent self - shielding is significant for the uvb feedback , as shown by @xcite . in particular ,",
    "such radiative transfer effects are likely to be essential , when the reionization proceeds at higher redshifts ( in higher density intergalactic matter ) .    in this paper , we perform 3d radiation hydrodynamic simulations with solving the radiative transfer for ionizing photons , and attempt to elucidate the feedback effects of the early reionization on the formation of subgalactic systems . in the next section , the method of numerical simulations is briefly described , and the assumption for ionizing radiation intensity is provided . in  [ results ] , we present the numerical results for uvb feedback and also make the convergence check of the results .  [ discussion ]",
    "is devoted to the discussion on the substructure problem .",
    "the details of numerical method is given in @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly describe the model and method for simulations .",
    "hydrodynamics is calculated by smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method .",
    "we use the version of sph by @xcite with the modification according to @xcite , and also we adopt the particle resizing formalism by @xcite . the gravitational force is calculated by a special purpose processor for gravity , grape-6 @xcite . in order to access grape boards ,",
    "we utilize the heterogeneous multi - computer system ( hmcs ) @xcite which allows us to use grape in parallel processors such as pc clusters .",
    "the softening length for gravity is set to be @xmath18pc for sph and cdm particles .",
    "this value is based on the convergence test shown in section [ results ] . the non - equilibrium chemistry and radiative cooling for primordial gas",
    "are included with the code developed by @xcite , where h@xmath19 cooling and reaction rates are taken from @xcite . to solve radiative transfer in an sph scheme ,",
    "we employ the method proposed by @xcite , which utilizes the neighbour lists of sph particles to evaluate the optical depth from a certain source to an sph particle .",
    "to generate uv background radiation , we put a single ionizing source located very far from the simulated region , and control the uv intensity by specifying the incident flux to the simulation box .",
    "we assume the history of uv intensity that allows the early reionization inferred by _ wmap_.",
    "since the recombination time scale is shorter than the hubble expansion time at @xmath20 @xcite , ionizing photons should be continuously supplied in order to retain the ionization .",
    "the requisite uv intensity is given by equating the recombination rate to ionization rate : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the intensity at lyman limit , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 respectively represent the recombination coefficient , ionization cross - section at lyman limit , and plank constant .",
    "@xmath26 is the present - day baryon density , @xmath27 is the spectral index of uv radiation , and @xmath28 is the fraction of neutral hydrogen . if @xmath29 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 is required .",
    "this should be regarded as the minimal prerequisite for two reasons .",
    "first , this estimate is provided for optically - thin media . in actual ionization history ,",
    "the radiative transfer effect is definitely important @xcite .",
    "secondly , in an inhomogeneous universe , local density enhancements increase the recombination rate significantly . taking these into account",
    ", we assume @xmath32 for @xmath33 with a sharp decrease at @xmath34 as @xmath35 $ ] . also , some models with @xmath36 are simulated to investigate the dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "the `` star formation '' condition adopted in this paper is basically the same as @xcite , except that @xmath37 is assumed here .",
    "@xmath37 means the star formation at maximal feasible rate , because no stars can form in a timescale shorter than local free - fall time . here",
    ", we do not include the internal feedback effects by stellar uv radiation as well as sn explosions .",
    "we assume @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , as the background cosmology .",
    "following the density fluctuations in this cosmology , the initial distributions of particles are set up .",
    "the mass of virialized dark halo is in the range of @xmath42 , and the collapse epoch is @xmath43 .",
    "we use @xmath44 sph particles and @xmath44 dark matter particles for a run .",
    "the numerical results are summarized in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the left panel shows the fraction of the final mass in stellar component to the initial baryon mass as a function of the collapse epoch @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while the right panel is the final fraction of gas . in both panels ,",
    "the fraction is depicted by different symbols .",
    "dotted lines represent the collapse epoch of halos formed from @xmath47 and @xmath48 cdm density fluctuations .",
    "roughly 95% of fluctuations collapse after the epoch predicted by the @xmath49 line .",
    "dashed lines denote the constant circular velocities , which are defined by @xmath50 with the virial radius @xmath51 determined by @xmath52 and @xmath46 .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ", we see that , if @xmath53 and @xmath54 , almost all baryons are transformed into stars , leaving little gas .",
    "it is noted that a considerable fraction of baryonic matter form stars even after the reionization ( @xmath55 ) . on the other hand , if @xmath2 , @xmath56 steeply decreases with decreasing circular velocities .",
    "also , @xmath57 becomes quite small as seen in the right panel .",
    "this reflects the effect of photo - evaporation by the uvb .",
    "the dependence of photo - evaporation on @xmath46 and @xmath45 is understood by the self - shielding and the gravitational potential .",
    "the self - shielding against uvb becomes prominent if the local density exceeds a threshold density as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "this means that the self - shielding is more effective if the system is larger or collapses at higher redshifts .",
    "the gas envelope that is not shielded from uvb is photo - heated to @xmath59k and is blown out by the enhanced thermal pressure , unless the gravitational potential is deep enough to retain the ionized gas ( i.e. @xmath54 ) .",
    "hence , the photo - evaporation is quite devastating for fluctuations with lower masses and later collapse epochs .",
    "intriguingly , a steep transition of @xmath56 for @xmath60 coincidentally lies on a line of nearly constant @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "this means that in more than 95% of the halos with @xmath60 , the star formation is strongly suppressed by the early reionization .    in the present simulation , the star formation",
    "is assumed to proceed in local free - fall time .",
    "this leads to the physically maximal star formation rate .",
    "hence , the obtained stellar fraction in a halo should be regarded as a maximal one .",
    "if the star formation proceeds in a longer timescale , baryon gas in a halo with @xmath60 could be almost completely photo - evaporated after the reionization . on the other hand , fluctuations with @xmath63",
    "is like to be impervious to the photo - evaporation , since the gravitational potential is deep enough to retain the ionized gas .    to examine the the dependence of results on assumed uvb intensity ( @xmath12 )",
    ", we also perform several runs with @xmath36 . in this case ,",
    "a steep transition of @xmath56 is slightly shifted to higher @xmath61 as @xmath64 .",
    "thus , it turns out that the results are not strongly dependent on the uvb intensity .",
    "such insensitiveness may be understood by the weak dependence of the self - shielding on the uv intensity seen in equation ( [ nshield ] ) .",
    "finally , to check the numerical effects , we analyze the convergence of the runs with changing the mass resolution and softening length . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , the left panel shows the final stellar fraction ( @xmath56 ) in runs with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , while the right panel is with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "they are at the transition region of @xmath56 in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the horizontal axis in figure [ fig2 ] is the softening length @xmath69 for gravity .",
    "four different curves correspond to the different numbers of particles used in the simulations .",
    "we can see that @xmath56 almost converges , if @xmath70 and if @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the present simulation with @xmath72 and @xmath73 is unlikely to suffer from numerical effects .",
    "the present numerical simulations predict strong negative feedback on the formation of dwarf galaxies with @xmath74 . based on @xmath56",
    ", we can make a rough estimation of the mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath75 ) for finally formed galaxies .",
    "if we assume @xmath76 for stars in solar units , @xmath77 corresponds to @xmath78 and @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "but , these values can not be compared directly with the observed @xmath75 of satellite galaxies , because a quite large fraction ( typically more than 90 percent ) of dark matter halos of satellites can be tidally stripped , as shown by @xcite .",
    "thus , the eventual @xmath75 of satellites is likely to decrease by a factor of 10 , e.g. @xmath81 for @xmath77 .",
    "local group dwarf galaxies ( dsphs and dirrs ) exhibit a wide range of @xmath75 , which is from a few up to @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "hence , the formed galaxies with @xmath83 may account for the local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "the present simulation predicts that only a few percent of fluctuations result in @xmath83 , if @xmath60 .",
    "if the star formation rate is lower , the probability is reduced further .",
    "hence , such intrinsically low - mass halos may be too few to account for all galactic satellites .",
    "one possibility to reconcile this discrepancy could be a model suggested by @xcite .",
    "they found that 10% of small halos originate in considerably larger systems with @xmath8 , which survived the tidal stripping , and suggest that the galactic satellites are descendants of relatively massive systems which formed at higher redshifts . in our simulation , systems larger than @xmath84 are not subject to the uvb feedback .",
    "thus , their model seems viable to account for the number of local group dwarf galaxies .",
