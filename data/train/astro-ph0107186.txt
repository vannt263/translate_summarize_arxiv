    "the cause or causes of the rapid light and spectrum variability of the  classical be stars \" is a longstanding problem with no convincing universal solution at hand ( see baade & balona 1994 , balona 1995 , smith 1999 , balona 2000 , baade , 2000 ) . both radial and nonradial pulsations ( hereafter ,",
    " nrp \" ) are endemic to this region of the h - r diagram , but the physical attributes and manifestations of short- and long - period modes can be quite different . in many respects the latter modes are not well understood . likewise , generally indirect evidence has been advanced that magnetic dissipation processes are somehow responsible for this rapid activity , even though magnetic fields have not been directly detected in nearly all be stars examined .",
    "an indicator of magnetically - triggered expulsions of matter leading to be  outbursts \" could be the presence of magnetospheric structures similar to the co - rotating tori over he - rich bp stars ( shore & brown 1990 ) .",
    "these tori ( herein  clouds \" ) absorb stellar flux as they occult the stellar disk and produce variability in broad - band uv light curves .",
    "if the structures are optically thick they can also produce variations in spectral line profiles of a rotating star that are similar in appearance to those produced by nrp .",
    "a broad consensus has formed ( e.g. , smith 2000b , baade 2000 ) that either or both mechanisms can play a role in ejecting mass from the surfaces of these stars , but even if both of them are operative their relative roles are unclear . to establish these roles",
    "requires that the mechanism for the variability be correctly assigned .",
    "except for a relative handful of multiple - periodic be stars , determining the variability mechanism is not always straightforward .",
    "statistical studies ( e.g. , balona 1990 ) suggest that the dominant periods of monoperiodic be stars in visible - band light are consistent with the stars rotational periods , although the latter quantities are generally not well known . on the other hand ,",
    "the variability periods are also in agreement with the range expected for long - period nrps arising from g - modes .",
    "in this paper we pose the question of whether candidate physical causes of the variability , most likely magnetospheric clouds or pulsations , can be determined in a be star which is variable on a rotational timescale ( see also smith 2000a ) . in phrasing this question , we make the assumption that circumstellar clouds should be _ cooler _ than the line forming region of the nearby photosphere and thus should cause preferential absorptions among low - excitation metallic lines as they pass between the star and the observer .",
    "we will address this issue by introducing a spectrophotometric technique tailored to high - resolution , far - ultraviolet echellograms of the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ) satellite processed by _",
    "newsips _ software .",
    "this technique proceeds by binning all fluxes within each of 60 echelle orders to form an equivalent low - resolution spectrum .",
    "we then ratio this spectrum with another spectrum observed at a time when the flux of the star is different , that is , by dividing spectra from a  bright - star \" phase(s ) with those from a  faint - star \" phase(s ) .",
    "the ratioed spectra so formed contain residual signatures of the variability mechanism because of the increased absorptions of an intervening medium or , in the case of pulsation because the temperature distribution or velocities in the photosphere are expected to be modified during a pulsation cycle .",
    "the resulting ratioed spectra are simulated by dividing a synthesized photospheric spectrum into a spectrum computed with absorptions from a slab of material in the line of sight .",
    "recently , smith & groote ( 2001 ) applied this spectrophotometric technique to evaluate physical conditions ( temperature , turbulence , area , and column density ) in magnetic torus - shaped clouds forced into corotation over two magnetic b stars , @xmath2ori  e and @xmath3cep .",
    "they found that the weak metallic lines which are the principal absorbers in the far - uv are formed in column densities of about 10@xmath4 particles @xmath5 and temperatures of 11,50013,000  k. because absorptions of metallic lines and continuous absorptions of hydrogen and h@xmath6 generally increase with decreasing temperature , these authors pointed out that spectrophotometric detections technique are most sensitive to low cloud temperatures ( 8,00010,000  k ) .",
    "however , there are other ways to infer the existence of a warmer material in an intervening medium .",
    "smith & groote found that the principal uv resonance lines of spectra of these stars are very strong , suggesting that the clouds must also have a warm component .",
    "as previous investigators found before them , smith & groote reported that the uv profiles from the clouds associated with he - strong bp stars maintain their shapes and strengths at a given phase over at least several years . in this paper , we ask whether putative clouds associated with be stars could have these same general properties .",
    "the _ iue _ echellogram data for this study were the high - dispersion spectral files from the short wavelength prime ( swp ) camera .",
    "the echellograms were downloaded from the mast data archive . in most cases , and wherever possible , large - aperture observations were used .",
    "the data selected for comparison were obtained generally observations made within a day of one another , typically in an intensive monitoring program .",
    "these data selections essentially avoid errors due to long - term degradations in the camera as well as changes in the reference point in the aperture used to recenter the stellar image .",
    "one exception to our selection practice is for a proof - of - concept demonstration which we make below for 88her , the variations of which occur usually over a timescale of years . in separate work",
    "we have found that _",
    "newsips _ calibrations are imperfect .",
    "for example , incomplete corrections in the _ newsips _ calibrations result in a residual systematic flux error of -1% yr@xmath7 at most _ swp_-camera wavelengths ;",
    "this correction is somewhat larger for wavelengths below @xmath81250 ( smith 1999a ) .",
    "these dependences can cause slowly varying time - dependent errors in the derived background fluxes of high - dispersion spectra , with resulting errors in the zero - point of the flux scale which affect net spectra at short wavelengths . fortunately , these effects are generally unimportant over short timescales covered in intensive monitoring campaigns such as those we utilized principally in this study .",
    "in addition , ratios of spectral fluxes tend to be insensitive to such errors . despite these grounds for optimism ,",
    "an important part of our data conditioning procedure was the monitoring of the depths of highly saturated resonance lines such as the civ and siiv doublets , lyman@xmath9 , and siiii at @xmath81206 and @xmath81298 .",
    "because these lines are already completely saturated in the cores , the core depths can not vary for astrophysical reasons , such as changes in atmospheric temperature or the added absorptions from circumstellar material . for spectra taken close together in time ,",
    "the core depths of these lines remained constant to within @xmath10% of the continuum level for nearly all the exposures in any one group .",
    "thus , we adopted this value as the uncertainty of the background levels in the program spectra . for wavelengths above @xmath81500 these errors drop to about half this value .",
    "our numerical analysis of our data proceeded by means of a computer program which first loops through all echelle spectra for a given star and tabulates the core depths of saturated lines mentioned above . attributing fluctuations of these depths to variations in the background level",
    ", we interpolated the implied zero - point offsets for orders between the resonance lines and extended them to these factors for short and long wavelength echelle orders .",
    "our code then computes corrections to the net fluxes by applying the ( nearly unitary ) ratios of the average core depths for all spectra to the core depths of each individual spectrum .",
    "the code next sums all valid fluxes in each order ( that is , it omits pixels with bad data quality flags ) and creates a low - resolution spectrum from them .",
    "this process was repeated for each spectrum in a time series , producing a stacked array of low - resolution , high signal - to - noise spectral ratios . the effective resolution of the binned spectrum is given by the echelle s free spectral range , which is typically about 20 angstroms .",
    "the final phase of the data manipulation consists of computing a pseudo - measure of the ultraviolet continuum ( hereafter ,  uvc \" ) , which is the average of the summed fluxes of four orders extending over the range @xmath1118001905 .",
    "we then relied upon a variability timescale , which is a period determined from ground - based or uv studies and is usually obvious in our _ iue_-derived flux curves as well .",
    "high - resolution spectra obtained at times when the star was uvc - bright were binned , co - added , and divided by the sum of spectra when the uvc flux was faint .",
    "this manipulation permits the computation of the ratio :    @xmath12    we will use the term  ratioed spectrum \" as short - hand in this paper to refer to this equation . depending on the astrophysical mechanism causing the variability , this spectrophotometric ratio can be related either to a theoretical ratio of two photospheric spectra or to one minus the occulted spectrum to the unocculted photospheric spectrum .",
    "errors in the ratioed spectra depend on several factors .",
    "one of the most important of these is the loss of sensitivity at short wavelengths .",
    "both smith , robinson , & hatzes ( 1998 ) and smith & groote ( 2001 ) determined r.m.s .",
    "errors of @xmath13% at long wavelengths which increased to @xmath14% at short wavelengths using binned flux - ratioing of _ iue _ data .",
    "we have examined the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations of a few ostensibly nonvariable stars and found values averaging @xmath15% for wavelengths above @xmath81300 .",
    "these estimates are based on both internal ( point - to - point ) variations and comparisons of ratioed spectra from data obtained from different groups of observations . for this study",
    "we have relied on two new approaches to address systematic errors , which we describe as follows .    in the first approach",
    ", we selected a pair of echellograms for the b3ve star @xmath16eri .",
    "these observations ( swp  55873 and swp  55889 ) were obtained 0.7 days apart , which is about half the principal 1.26 day variability cycle discovered by balona , engelbrecht , & marang ( 1987 ; see also leister et al .",
    "we constructed a ratioed spectrum both from _ newsips_- and _ iuesips_-processed data .",
    "the background flux solutions derived by these processing systems are altogether different . although the _ newsips_-derived values are usually more accurate ( but typically slightly low ) , they were derived by sampling non - local as well as local fluxes on the echellogram .",
    "in contrast , _ iuesips _ backgrounds were determined only from local fluxes and tend to be high .",
    "figure  [ msfig1 ] shows spectral ratios from both extractions .",
    "we take their differences to be a generous estimate of errors resulting from flux extractions .",
    "note that both curves start near unity at long wavelengths and increase almost monotonically toward short wavelengths .",
    "a  spike \" at lyman  @xmath16 in the ratioed spectrum resulting from the fluxes of both constituent spectra being low and hence producing an uncertain ratio . at long wavelengths the mean ratios of the _ iuesips _ and _ newsips _",
    "spectra are nearly identical , and the difference between them is typically @xmath14% . at shorter wavelengths",
    "these errors increase until at @xmath81160 the curves become meaningless .",
    "the important result here is that the curves are mutually consistent , suggesting that the low - resolution spectral ratios are insensitive to the method of flux extraction .",
    "to evaluate the effects of background flux errors , we repeated our manipulation of the same pair of _ newsips _ spectra , but this time we lowered the background by an assumed error which is linear in decreasing wavelength and normalized it to -2% of full continuum at 1250 angstroms . the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ msfig1 ] exhibits the result of dividing this modified spectrum by the original one  that is , the result of the perturbed background flux levels .",
    "this curve again increases toward shorter wavelength and also causes a faint spike at lyman  @xmath16 . in all , although the amplitude of these features is small , the spectrum - to - spectrum deviations in background level can potentially could produce second - order errors at short wavelengths .    as a second approach to evaluating systematics in ratioed spectra",
    ", we constructed an artificial  knife - edge test \" by comparing pairs of spectra of a nonvariable star . in one case",
    "one spectrum was obtained with the star within the aperture , and in the other case it had begun to drift to the aperture edge .",
    "we selected two pairs of small aperture spectra for this purpose for the stars 16  lac and @xmath17  ori ( swp  05858 & 05860 and swp  22163 & 22158 ) .",
    "these observations were obtained during times when the stars appeared otherwise constant in brightness . inverting the ratios to represent an artificial brightening",
    ", we found that the ratioed spectra exhibited slopes of -20% and -2% with respect to their mean flux ratios minus one . thus , this is a nearly flat but slightly red response .",
    "both ratioed spectra showed r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations of about 1% , which is consistent with the r.m.s .",
    "values quoted above .      to model the observed spectral ratios , we used a suite of codes written by i. hubeny and collaborators to compute synthesized ratios of stellar spectra ( in the case of pulsation ) or absorptions of the stellar spectrum ( in the case of an occulting medium ) . to mimic our actions on the observed data , we first divided the spectra one by the other and then binned them to the effective free spectral range of the _ swp _ camera .",
    "for the case of pulsation , in which one photospheric spectrum is divided by another , the comparison to the observations is conceptually straightforward because computed and observed ratios are nearly unity . for the case of absorbing clouds",
    "the computed absorptions are normalized to the stellar continuum .",
    "then , a weak absorption spectrum ratio will be some fraction between zero and one .",
    "the first of the hubeny codes , _ synspec _ , is a spectral line synthesis program developed for input non - lte and/or line - blanketed model atmospheres ( hubeny , lanz , & jeffery 1994 ) .",
    "we used standard lte model atmospheres by kurucz ( 1993 ) as input to _",
    "synspec_. _ synspec _ is embedded within an idl wrapper ( hubeny 1996 ) to facilitate the calculation of spectra for a variety of atmospheric parameters .",
    "for our program we ran models with log  g = 4 , a microturbulence of 5 km  s@xmath7 , and no rotational broadening .",
    "another available option in _",
    "synspec _ is to modify the run of atmospheric temperature , t(@xmath18x ) .",
    "we used this option to mimic variations in the temperature gradient which occur during a radial pulsation .    to simulate the effects of a cloud on the composite spectrum",
    ", we used the hubeny _ circus _ program ( hubeny 1996 , hubeny & heap 1996 ) .",
    "this code was written to compute line absorptions and/or emissions of a gas cloud situated either in front or off the limb of a reference star .",
    "these absorptions comprise the so - called  iron curtain \" in the ultraviolet . _ circus _",
    "requires the user to specify physical cloud parameters such as temperature , density , geometry , composition , microturbulence , column depth , and areal coverage factor .",
    "the computations are performed at the same wavelengths as for the synthesized photospheric spectrum .",
    "_ circus _ can accommodate clouds with as many as three separate sets of conditions , sizes , and positions .",
    "however , in this work we considered mainly homogeneous clouds . in its solution of the radiative transfer equation _ circus _ computes line emission and absorptions separately .",
    "these options can be treated as  switches \" and permits the investigator to evaluate the two effects separately .",
    "the cloud temperatures we consider are generally less than 20,000  k. for this temperature range reemission in both the resonance transitions and weak iron - curtain lines is negligible .    _ circus",
    "_ proceeds by consulting a kurucz ( 1990 ) line library of atomic absorption parameters and computing an opacity spectrum for a user - specified temperature , composition ( solar ) , and electron density .",
    "the spectra were computed at a spacing of 0.01 angstroms , thereby resolving most uv lines in the kurucz line library . the optical depth in each line is determined from the computed opacity spectrum and the input column density .",
    "the surface of the star is divided into a grid and the local intensity spectrum is evaluated at each grid point , thereby taking into account effects of foreshortening and limb darkening .",
    "the density and geometrical coverage factors of the assumed cloud are additional necessary parameters in our analysis . for our initial models we started with a trial volume density of 10@xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "this estimate is based on the probable cloud densities of 10@xmath2110@xmath19 @xmath20 that appear to prevail in the rotating magnetic b stars ( e.g. smith & groote 2001 ) . for simplicity we ran models with a full ( 100% ) areal coverage factor .",
    "the actual coverage factor for any given case may be obtained by scaling the full - coverage models to the observed level of the ratioed spectra ( minus one ) . the positions and amplitudes of individual absorption peaks in the observed spectral ratio",
    "can then be used to determine the cloud temperature and column density , respectively .",
    "_ circus _ includes a provision for various doppler effects , including stellar rotation .",
    "the program computes the net doppler velocity between each projected element of the cloud and the background star along the observer s line of sight . for a co - rotating cloud",
    "the velocities along the line of sight are the same , so the net shift is zero .",
    "another relevant factor in determining cloud absorptions is the microturbulence .",
    "however , smith & groote ( 2001 ) found that velocities less than 20 km  s@xmath7 produce similar cloud spectra , so we used this value as a default .",
    "over a broad range of possible cloud temperatures , the density of metallic metallic lines increases with decreasing temperature in nearly all ultraviolet and visible band regions . for a reference cloud model of t@xmath22 @xmath23 13,000  k and a particle density n@xmath24 = 3@xmath2510@xmath26  @xmath20 ,",
    "the sum of the hydrogen bound - free absorption and electron scattering coefficients is about 8@xmath2510@xmath27 @xmath28 . for this model we tabulated the number of local maxima in computed absorption spectrum and found a total of some 26,000 unblended lines .",
    "the median strength of these lines is only 65% as strong as the continuous opacity , so the majority of the lines becomes optically thick at almost the same column density as the underlying opacity continuum . in the optically thin limit the wavelength binning of the absorption spectrum to @xmath2920   generates amorphous  features \" due to local line aggregates which can arise above the continuous absorption by a factor of up to 23 .",
    "a detailed inspection of the line strength distribution in the @xmath1111502000 wavelength region shows that the median strength is typically higher than the lower - envelope of the absorptions by only tens of percent .",
    "thus , except in the case of strong lines ( lyman  @xmath16 , resonance lines of siiii , siiv , and civ ) , the binned spectrophotometric features are nearly as optically thin as the absorption windows between them .",
    "this fact explains why the calculated spectra are insensitive to the microturbulence velocity parameter @xmath30 over a range of values . for intermediate column",
    "densities the optically thin features diminish in amplitude and gradually lose their identities .",
    "as one increases the column still further , the absorptions finally become optically thick at all wavelengths . for cloud temperatures of 8,000  k and 13,000  k",
    ", this happens for column densities of about 1.5@xmath2510@xmath4 and 3@xmath2510@xmath31 @xmath5 , respectively . at this point",
    "the fraction of absorbed flux increases to about 80% to 90% , respectively , and the spectrum shape becomes almost flat .",
    "although the morphology of the absorption spectrum depends on the contrast with the underlying photospheric spectra , our _ circus _ models suggest that the detailed features are well preserved over a typical range in effective temperatures of @xmath32  k for t@xmath33 @xmath34 13,000  k. figure  [ msfig2 ] exhibits absorption spectra computed for a variety of indicated cloud temperatures , a column density of 1@xmath2510@xmath4 @xmath5 , n@xmath24 = 3@xmath2510@xmath21 @xmath20 , @xmath30 = 20 km  s@xmath7 , and coverage factor of 1 . because the postulated clouds co - rotate with the star , the results are the same for nonrotating and rotating star inputs .",
    "we have also run models of rapidly rotating stars and with intervening clouds having no doppler component along the line of sight , i.e. , the case of quasi - static _ shells . _",
    "the primary departures from the co - rotating cloud models are that resonance lines exhibit slightly added absorptions because their saturations are lifted by the velocity difference along the line of sight .",
    "changes in cloud temperature greatly modify the shape of the ratioed spectrum , particularly for values less than 11,000  k. this is a combined result of the increased hydrogenic absorption and a shift from third to second - ionization stages of chiefly the fe - group elements .",
    "consider especially how cool temperatures affect strong lines : the most prominent feature arises from the resonance siiii line at 1206     and lyman@xmath9 , which dominate two adjacent wavelength bins .",
    "other sharp features in the binned ratioed spectrum are caused by resonance lines of siiv ( @xmath23@xmath81400 ) and civ ( @xmath23@xmath81548 - 50 ) , and from excited multiplets of ciii ( @xmath81176 ) and siiii ( @xmath351300 ) .",
    "all of these features are visible for temperatures @xmath36 13,000  k.    resonance lines are less visible for cool temperatures ( t@xmath22 @xmath37 11,000  k ) .",
    "this is partly a consequence of the continuous opacity becoming stronger as hydrogen recombines .",
    "in addition , as these lines disappear resonance lines of second - stage ions appear at longer wavelengths , often beyond the _ swp _ camera range . however , a few resonance lines of less ionized species still play roles in the general rise of absorption for all cloud temperatures considered , particularly at wavelengths below @xmath81200 .",
    "a good example is the confluence of siii @xmath1111901197 lines which fall near a number of strong excited feiii lines .",
    "in addition , at lower temperatures the siii lines saturate and form strong damping wings .",
    "these increased absorptions , along with the still - strong siiii @xmath81206 and lyman  @xmath16 lines form a strong composite absorption .",
    "when these features are binned with a group of nearby excited siiii and low - excitation feii lines , they produce a general increase in absorption below lyman  @xmath16 .    at longer wavelengths several broad features form that provide convenient diagnostics of temperatures in ratioed _",
    "swp _ spectra .",
    "the most well known of these is the absorption centered at @xmath81900 ( e.g. , bjorkman , bjorkman , & wood 2000 ; hereafter  bbw \" ) .",
    "this broad feature appears at a clouds temperatures between 10,000 - 17,000  k and attains its maximum strength at 15,000  k. the absorption is largely due to a variety of excited ( @xmath38 = 810 ev ) feiii lines . for temperatures less than about 9,000",
    "k the ionization of iron shifts from fe@xmath39 to fe  @xmath40 , causing an important feii absorption feature to appear at @xmath1116001700 .",
    "a secondary peak at @xmath81850 is formed at cool temperatures largely from excited feii atoms .",
    "an additional weak peak centered near @xmath82050 is formed from an assorted collection of excited second - ionization lines of iron - like atoms and fei resonance lines .",
    "recently , groote & smith ( 2001 ) were able to use weak features near @xmath81650 and @xmath81900 in the binned spectral ratios of the magnetic b stars @xmath2  ori  e and @xmath3  cep to determine temperatures in the outer regions of their co - rotating clouds .",
    "nonradial pulsations on a star cause different regions to move both horizontally and vertically , causing periodic modulations in atmospheric temperature and pressure .",
    "an external observer viewing this activity will alternately view a dominance of first hot and then cool regions as the pattern moves across the projected stellar disk . by ratioing atmospheric fluxes from these regions ,",
    "one obtains a spectrophotometric signature of the pulsations . in figure",
    "[ msfig3]a we exhibit this behavior to first order by ratioing the synthesized spectra of static atmospheres having effective temperatures of 26,000  k and 22,000  k. this example clearly represents an exaggeration of flux variations in most nrp stars , but it serves to emphasize the signatures of a simple atmospheric flux ratio .",
    "even so , the only clear temperature signatures are weak flux - ratio elevations corresponding to the lyman  @xmath16 line and the siiii @xmath81300 multiplet .",
    "unlike the cloud absorption models , this ratioed spectrum displays no  sharp \" feature at @xmath1111001150 .",
    "small - amplitude fluctuations at long wavelengths are the result of an incomplete cancellation of a complex array of line strengths in the two constitutent spectra .",
    "otherwise , this ratio may be roughly characterized as a monotonic function increasing with decreasing wavelength . other authors",
    "( e.g. , peters 1991 , cugier , daszynska , & polubek 1996 , peters 1998b ) have exploited this dependence by fitting uv variations of nrp early - b stars to _ iue swp _ spectra .",
    "as the terms suggest , radial pulsations differ from nonradial pulsations in that the locally imposed motions are vertical . as such , they are coherent over the entire stellar disk at any given phase .",
    "the local velocity amplitudes of the radial modes in a few @xmath3  cephei stars can be very large , even exceeding the atmospheric sound velocity .",
    "such motions typically modify the atmospheric structure by enhancing the temperature difference between the line and continuum formation regions .",
    "occasionally , sharp absorption features appear at low negative velocities and then move redward through the line profile as a consequence of pulsational shock waves traveling through these atmospheres ( e.g. , campos & smith 1981 , smith 1983 , mathias , gillet & crowe 1992 ) .",
    "phase delays are well known to occur for resonance lines formed in superficial atmospheric layers ( e.g. , burger , de jager , & van den oord 1982 ) .",
    "we have pursued the burger et al .",
    "finding by inspecting line fluxes of a number of strong lines in the spectra of the large - amplitude pulsators bwvul and @xmath41eri during their radial pulsation cycles .",
    "all the lines we investigated showed a pronounced strengthening as the pulsation wave entered the line forming region .",
    "atmospheric simulations show that two ways of simulating these strengthenings is to lower the atmospheric boundary temperature ( or in the more realistic formulation of non - lte , one accounts for lowered excitation temperatures of lines due to the radiation boundary ) or to increase the velocity broadening ( e.g. , microturbulence ) of the spectral lines .",
    "the temperature effect also can be inferred in the reddening of the colors of @xmath3cep stars during the phase of maximum distension ( relative to phase of compression ) .",
    "although dynamic model atmospheres do not exist for @xmath3cep stars , we have utilized these facts to make a simplified approximation in creating a pair of modified model atmospheres by altering the temperature distribution t(@xmath18x ) for a t@xmath33 = 24,000  k , log  g = 4 kurucz atmosphere to mimic the effects of the passing wave in strengthening the  temperature \" gradient .",
    "the temperatures in the line formation regions ( @xmath18x = 10@xmath4210@xmath43 ) of these models differ from the reference atmosphere by @xmath44400  k , which is a typical temperature amplitude in the atmosphere of a @xmath3  cep star over the course of a pulsational cycle .",
    "these distributions are displayed in figure  [ msfig3]b .",
    "we also increased the atmospheric microturbulence from zero to 15 km  s@xmath7 in the steep - gradient model in order to attempt to simulate the effects of turbulence following the passage of a shock wave ( stamford & watson 1981 ) .",
    "synthesized spectra were then generated from these altered models and ratioed .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ msfig3]c .",
    "one can see from this that the results of perturbing the atmospheric distribution cause appreciable differences in the aggregate absorptions of spectral lines and therefore in the appearance of the two photospheric spectra .",
    "thus , the ratioed spectra resulting from these simple descriptions of radial and nonradial pulsations ( fig .",
    "[ msfig3]a ) are quite different . notice that flux contrasts at lyman  @xmath16 again produce a local spike in the ratioed spectrum .",
    "however , a broad feature appearing at @xmath1112401375 has a more subtle explanation .",
    "the lines in this spectral region are comparatively sparse except for several strong siiii and cii lines near @xmath81300 .",
    "the latter region is also nestled between the strong line siiii @xmath81206 and ly  @xmath16 lines on one side and many stronger lines above @xmath81375 .",
    "these lines respond sensitively to the steepening of the temperature gradient .",
    "highly saturated lines in the spectrum , such as @xmath81206 , are sensitive to increases in microturbulence . the overall effect of this arrangement of strong lines is to create the illusion of a transparent window at @xmath1112401380 punctuated by a sharp peak at @xmath81300 .",
    "a weak  plateau \" is often also present in the region between the siiv and civ doublets , and this is due to a large assortment of fe - group lines .",
    "two weak absorption features at @xmath81650 and @xmath82000 have similar explanations .",
    "we emphasize that the particular atmospheric model described above in the radial pulsation simulation is simplistic and probably a nonunique .",
    "furenlid et al . (",

    "rapid injections of warm gas seem to have expanded outward from the star and cooled during the long outburst cycle .",

    "one _ pulsation cycle .",
    "smith & groote ( 2001 ) used ratioed spectra over different phases of this 12-day _ rotation _ cycle of this same star to demonstrate the presence of a co - rotating cloud . in the material used for constructing the @xmath3cep curve in our figure ,",
    "the cloud absorptions were equally present during both bright- and faint - star pulsation phases .",
    "hence , the spectrophotometric ratioing technique can be utilized in a several - hour time series to detect pulsations in a magnetic star occulted by a cloud .",
    "the primary goal of our study was to see whether spectrophotometric information derived from short - wavelength _ iue _ observations can be used as an tool for candidate variability models operating in be stars such as nonradial pulsation and magnetic co - rotating clouds .",
    "one answer to this question is that the discrimination between the npr and cloud models requires corroborative evidence , such as the selective strengthening of low - excitation lines on the timescale of the star s rotation period .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes results for 18 early - to - mid be stars with rapid and arguably periodic uv continuum variations . these are stars from a more complete sample of early - type be stars assembled by the author which have been observed repeatedly by the _ iue _",
    "satellite during its lifetime .",
    "cbr , xper , 66oph , 48lib , and @xmath0oph .",
    "the observations of several other demonstrable variable stars were too widely spaced in time for a reliable analysis .",
    "marginal results were found for three stars , 28cma , @xmath61cma , and @xmath16ara , and are discussed following the presentation of table 1 . ]",
    " group 1 \" in the table consists of five stars , each of which shows at least mild ( @xmath36 8% ) uv variations and for which ratioed spectra exhibit the pulsational signatures , discussed in @xmath51[puls ] these are similar to those in figs .",
    "[ msfig3 ] and [ msfig8 ] . in figure",
    "[ msfig9]a we exhibit ratioed spectra of @xmath17cen , dueri ( hr1423 ) ewlac , @xmath8eri and which show these same signatures .",
    "the signatures are stable for these stars , being present consistently for different combinations of faint- and bright - phase spectra .",
    "if @xmath59  per serves as a model , large - amplitude pulsations can produce strong , local atmospheric gradients in temperature and/or velocity which have signatures visible in far - uv spectra . from the length of the periods",
    "the pulsations must be nonradial pulsations .",
    "group  2 in the table consists eight be stars with periodic uvc variations that are nearly monotonic with wavelength .",
    "[ msfig9]b depicts ratioed spectra of 28cyg , @xmath62and , @xmath59cap , and @xmath63  ori as examples . the spectrum for @xmath16eri , also in this category , has already been shown in fig .",
    "[ msfig1 ] .",
    "the ratioed spectra of these stars do not show repeatable discrete features , but rather a tendency to rise toward short wavelengths .",
    "this pattern is consistent with the ratio of spectra synthesized from model atmospheres with different values of t@xmath33 and is also in keeping with the ( small - amplitude ) nonradial pulsation paradigm in which spectrum contrasts are produced over time as mutually cancelling cool and hot regions travel across the disk with phase ( fig.[msfig1]c ) .",
    "of course , such an explanation does not rule out the alternative interpretation of absorbing clouds .",
    "however , the continua of the clouds absorption spectrum would necessarily have to be optically thick and the coverage factors would have to be nearly 100% .",
    "in addition , we noticed in our data inspection that the resonance lines can have variable amplitudes from one brightness cycle to the next .",
    "hence , if the variability of these stars arose from cloud absorptions , the clouds would have to be able to change their structures over a timescale of about a day .",
    "one can not rule out the presence of large clouds with such transient properties , but this phenomenology is not present in clouds over rotating magnetic b and bp stars .",
    "thus , the spectrophotometric diagnostics favor nonradial pulsation for most or all the stars in group  2 arise from nonradial pulsation as well .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath16eri , previously displayed in fig.[msfig1 ] , is a case that should be singled out for special discussion .",
    "a direct comparison of its spectra and its uvc light curve reveals that the photospheric components of this star s siiv and civ resonance lines are _ anticorrelated _ with periodic uvc variations , and they probably have a small phase delay .",
    "moreover , time series of optical spectra of this star disclose that the he  i @xmath85876 and @xmath86678 lines can have variations which are not morphologically similar ( rivinius 1999 ) .",
    "all these behaviors are puzzling according to our current understanding of nonradial pulsations .",
    "nonetheless , other patterns , such as the variation of the aliii doublet , can be understood easily within the context of nrp .",
    "for example , these lines do not have deep cores that would be indicative of a cloud or shell at any phase .",
    "in addition , the wings of these lines strengthen during the  faint star \" phase of a cycle .",
    "this fact can be explained simply as the result of an ionization shift occurring in a high density gas , i.e. , at the high temperature extremum in a temperature - modulating photosphere .",
    "hence this behavior argues for nonradial pulsations in @xmath16eri .",
    "finally , group  3 of table  [ tab1 ] consists of three stars with cool co - rotating magnetospheres .",
    "we have already discussed the arguments for including 60cyg and @xmath0tau in this group .",
    "in addition , we include the unusual be star @xmath58cas .",
    "we do not discuss this star herein because we have treated it at length elsewhere ( smith , robinson , & hatzes 1998 ) and also because this star s x - ray and uv variability patterns are unique.13356 and siii @xmath81200 lines show a clear correlation with the continuum light curve , as would be expected for clouds having a cool component . ]",
    "three other stars , 28  cma , @xmath16  ara and @xmath61  cma , which turned up in the course of our investigation are not listed in the table .",
    "however , they have redshifted emission in the siiv and civ lines and therefore are candidates for having torus - clouds . in the spectrum of 28 ( @xmath63 )",
    "cma one finds mild redshifted emission components in civ and siiv lines which vary on an unknown timescale .",
    "these characteristics could be explained in principle variable p  cygni - type wind activity , but probably not for the strong nv absorptions in the spectrum of this relatively cool ( b2.5 iv - v ) star .",
    "optical work shows that 28cma is also an apparently - single star viewed at a nearly pole - on orientation in which the lines exhibit profile variations attributed to nrp ( maintz et al . 2000 ; but see balona et al .",
    "in addition , optical lines formed at low densities and/or temperatures show their own special rapid , quasi - periodic behavior , suggesting the presence of a rarified structure above the photosphere ( stefl et al .",
    "1998 , stefl et al .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "spectra of the rapidly rotating b2.5vne star @xmath16ara likewise exhibit redshifted emissions in the civ and siiv lines that are variable even over 2 hours .",
    "this star has neither a variable radial velocity history ( thackeray 1966 ) nor a high x - ray flux ( cohen , cassinelli , & macfarlane 1997 ) that could be indicate the presence of hot gas streams in an interactive binary .",
    "a third conceivable cloud - bearing candidate , @xmath61cma ( b1.5ivne ) , was observed with the _ iue swp _ only three times , but its civ and siiv lines once again show weak redshifted activity and possible emission , though on an indeterminate timescale .",
    "nv absorptions are also visible .",
    "balona ( 1990 ) has noted rapid photometric variations consistent with the rotational period during an outburst of this star .",
    "this study has demonstrated that high - dispersion _ iue _ archival spectra of variable b stars can be manipulated to bring out qualitatively new information about the mechanisms responsible for these variations .",
    "bjorkman , bjorkman , & wood ( 2000 ) have recently used uv spectrophotometry to determine physical attributes of circumstellar material around be stars .",
    "in contrast to our technique , their study exploited the polarization signatures of asymmetrical _ large - scale _ circumstellar structures from single observations . although our study has been limited to _",
    "iue swp _ data , it also could be extended in principle to long - wavelength camera data of large - amplitude late - b , a- , and f - type variables . in @xmath51[analy ] we demonstrated how quantitative information can be gleened about gas ejected by hot stars .",
    "our examples included be stars which are surrounded by a compressed wind - wake , eject shells , have co - rotating clouds , or undergo large - amplitude pulsation .",
    "indeed , our binned spectrum - ratio results demonstrate that quasi - monochromatic spectrophotometic changes of a be star do not necessary imply the variation of its photospheric temperature from pulsation ( cf .",
    "peters 1998b ) , although this may well be the rule .",
    "the technique does not work well for determining parameters of inhomogeneous clouds or even of cool , dense clouds with small projected areas .",
    "even so , we have seen that the presence of a warm cloud component may be inferred from a spectral analysis of specific lines in the same observations . because residual errors in flux calibrations are still present , _",
    "data are limited in how they can be utilized over extended time periods .",
    "still , they are useful in the some cases . for 88her",
    "in particular the progressive change in line strengths during an outburst shows that the  phase lag \" of a dip in the _ visible - band _ light curve can be understood by the cooling of an expanding shell .",
    "thus , the technique can compliment post - outburst observations of high - level balmer lines and infrared emission studies in be stars",
    ". it can be particularly helpful in quantifying changes of shell parameters with distance from the star .",
    "although one goal of this study was to diagnose the physical cause(s ) of light and absorption line variability in classical be stars , our success in using uv spectrophotometry for this purpose must be said to be mixed : potential ambiguities could arise between dense clouds and weak nrps in some cases . according to our  group  3 \" list ,",
    "be stars with candidate co - rotating clouds actually show identifiable spectrophotometric signatures in only three of five cases . even leaving aside such unique stars as @xmath58  cas",
    ", a good case can be made for the existence of magnetic co - rotating clouds in only a minority of be stars . aside from the parenthesized entries our sample is relatively unbiased of variable early - to - mid b stars ( as far as we know ) ,",
    "so one may take the implied fraction of them having clouds to be about 1/81/4 .",
    "these rough statistics suggest a magnetic cause ( or trigger ) for the be phenomenon in at least a minority of classical be stars .",
    "the existence of co - rotating clouds in particular seems to be a by - product of _ dipolar _ fields ( shore & brown 1990 ) however , evidence exists also for _ localized _ , transient magnetic activity in other be stars .",
    "such evidence includes rapid line profile variability ( e.g. ,  dimples \" ; smith & polidan 1993 ) , and in the case of @xmath8eri , the appearance of an x - ray flare .",
    "thus , it is possible that localized fields can play a role on the surfaces of other be stars .",
    "unfortunately , hypothetical prominence - type clouds associated with small - scale magnetic loops on be stars ( e.g. , peters 1998b ) could not be detected with ratioed _ iue _ spectra .",
    "thus , we look to future optical studies of cloud - candidate be stars to confirm the results of this work .",
    "evidence of transits of low - density and temperature clouds might be found in high - quality time - series spectra , both in the appearance high - level balmer lines and as occasional brief events observed in many lines .",
