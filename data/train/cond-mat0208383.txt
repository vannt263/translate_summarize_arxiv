    "it has been more than 15 years since the discovery of the high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite .",
    "although much has been learned since , there is still no satisfactory explanation of what causes the superconductivity .",
    "there is widespread agreement that it should be possible to describe the electronic properties of the square cuo@xmath1 lattices by the two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model .",
    "this well known model is given by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 creates an electron on site @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a nearest neighbor of @xmath4 .",
    "this model contains both the movement of the electrons ( hopping ) ( @xmath7 , kinetic energy ) and the interactions of the electrons if they are on the same site ( @xmath8 , potential energy ) .",
    "the hubbard model is one of the simplest possible models of interacting electrons .",
    "the main problem is then finding the possible solutions of this model .",
    "this however has proven not to be an easy task .",
    "the hilbert space of the model is too large for exact numerical solutions .",
    "monte carlo simulations have the minus sign problem .",
    "@xmath8 is approximately equal to @xmath9 , so we are neither in an extremely strong , nor in a weakly interacting limit .",
    "therefore , perturbation theory is of limited use . in order to get somewhere",
    "we therefore need to invoke simplifications . in this article",
    "the main assumption is that we assume that a lightly doped system displays sublattice order .",
    "stripes were first detected in cuprates@xcite in the famous neutron scattering experiment of tranquada and coworkers .",
    "earlier theoretical approaches already predicted stripes before their experimental discovery @xcite .",
    "we know experimentally that stripes are quarter - filled from a plot of incommensuration versus doping ( the yamada plot ) , which is a straight line from 0 to 0.125 doping with a slope of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the dmrg calculations by white and scalapino @xcite have also shown that the ground - state for stripes in the @xmath11-@xmath12 model is approximately quarter - filled .",
    "the question of why stripes are quarter filled is not , however , the only enigma surrounding stripes .",
    "other questions that still need to be answered are for instancei : why they are so narrow ?",
    "are they insulators or metals ?",
    "are they bond - centered of site - centered ?",
    "are they superconducting ?",
    "is the conductivity perpendicular or along a stripe ?",
    "are they like @xmath13 or like @xmath14 density waves@xcite ? in an offshoot to this article we will detail a possible reason why stripes are quarter - filled .",
    "throughout this work we will focus our discussion on the hubbard model . nevertheless , all that we will state can be applied to a wider range of models with additional longer range interactions and hoppings .",
    "we will assume from the outset that bond - centered stripes ( stripes with the geometry of two leg ladders ) form antiphase domain walls in the surrounding antiferromagnetic and demonstrate how self consistent localized eigenstates and pairing follow from this assumption .    in section ( [ principle ] )",
    ", we introduce the sublattice principle which will form the backbone of our analysis . in order to streamline the quintessential physics",
    ", we will be brief in exposing this principle .",
    "for further details regarding the underpinnings of this principle , the interested reader may peruse appendix a. invoking the sublattice principle , we will show in section ( [ confine ] ) how exponentially localized wavefunctions will be found when we assume , self consistently , that stripes form antiphase domain walls .",
    "we will find that the transverse stripe scale is of the order of the lattice constant .",
    "what drives stripe formation in our picture are not confining magnetic string potentials , but a rather novel kinetic effect which we term _ dynamical confinement_.    once we establish , self consistently , that bond centered stripes form domain walls in the surrounding antiferromagnet , we will move in small steps towards examining further microscopics . as we will explain in section ( [ ladder ] ) , we will consider a bond centered stripe engulfed by a surrounding antiferromagnetic region as a two leg ladder immersed in an external staggered magnetic field .",
    "we will then consider the problem of a single electron on a staggered empty two leg ladder ( section ( [ empty - one ] ) ) which will facilitate the analysis of a single hole on an otherwise full staggered two leg ladder ( section ( [ full - one ] ) ) .",
    "both problems will lead to similar results .",
    "this will be followed by a similar analysis for a two electron system on an empty staggered ladder and the inverted problem of two holes on a full staggered ladder , in sections ( [ 2-empty ] ) and ( [ 2-full ] ) respectively .",
    "the surprising conclusion is that in this case there is an essential difference between electrons and holes .",
    "numerically , we find that for holes , pair states are slightly favored over single hole states although the correlations are very faint .",
    "having shown how narrow bond centered stripes with bound pair states emerge , in section ( [ dmrrrg ] ) we fuse all of our finding together to reconstruct the real space dmrg pictures of white and scalapino .    in section ( [ added ] )",
    ", we will examine the effects of longer range coulomb effects and additional longer range kinetic terms to show how much of our self consistent analysis can easily be fortified by the addition of such terms .",
    "the physics of holes and spins in two dimensions is a very complicated subject . in this article",
    "we will invoke the simplifying assumption that much of the low energy physics of holes in a strong antiferromagnetic background can be summed in a nutshell :      this principle is equivalent to the omission of spin flips , waves , and string states .",
    "this sublattice parity principle is , of course , a gross oversimplification- the physics of hole motion in an antiferromagnetic is a fascinating and rich topic .",
    "nonetheless , the low energy single hole dispersion curves ( requiring careful extensive numerical work ) coincide very well with those immediately following from this principle . for a review of this often overlooked principle ,",
    "the reader is invited to read appendix ( [ sub_prin ] ) .",
    "many beautiful works exist on the subject of stripe formation and dynamics @xcite . in recent years",
    ", hole dynamics on the stripe has been primarily addressed in terms of spinon - holon excitations , as in the early works of tchernyshyov and pryadko @xcite . in this article",
    "we do _ not _ assume that the elementary excitations are spinons and holons .",
    "our approach is closer in spirit to the very interesting work of chernyshev , white , and castro neto @xcite , which aim to answer the same fundamental questions concerning stripes .",
    "their work examines the elementary excitations within the framework of the @xmath11-@xmath17 model by examining retraceable paths of a hole out of the stripe into the surrounding antiferromagnet .",
    "we arrive at much of the same physics using the sublattice parity principle as our only guide .",
    "our derivations are much more pedestrian yet physically transparent as compared to the detailed green s function and numerical dmrg analysis carried out by these authors .",
    "many works place much emphasis on the string states created by hole motion or on kinks @xcite . in our low energy analysis , there are _ no string states_. for a discussion on how string states can be avoided and for a demonstration that they do not dominate the low energy physics , the reader is referred to appendix ( [ sub_prin ] ) .",
    "similarly , the role of a domain wall in an antiferromagnet as an effective attractive potential for holes simply by the bad ferromagnetic magnetic bonds that they remove , and the careful interplay between string states and transverse and longitudinal hole kinetics is not what we consider here .",
    "a large body of literature complements our simple asymptotic low energy analysis .",
    "the sublattice parity principle amounts to the assumption that a hole in an antiferromagnet is free and can move to all of its _ next _ nearest but not to its direct neighbors .",
    "this principle is based on and follows from the sublattice structure of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "we will provide phenomenological proof for this assumption by examining the dispersion relations obtained by very detailed numerical works .",
    "the last ( ising ) term of the heisenberg hamiltonian wants to make the spins on neighboring lattice sites point in opposite directions .",
    "if only this term is present , the groundstate will be a perfect ising antiferromagnet with long - range ( nel ) order : the lattice can be subdivided in an up sublattice and a down sublattice .",
    "however , the first ( xy ) term in the hamiltonian can undo this order by flipping two neighboring , opposite spins . in principle",
    "this term can completely destroy the long range order and indeed it does so in one dimension . in dimensions @xmath147 clear sublattice order prevails . a large amount of effort in numerical calculations and the very important analysis of the non - linear sigma model by chakravarty , halperin and nelson@xcite",
    "have shown that the ground - state of the two - dimensional heisenberg model ( and thus of the undoped hubbard model ) is a long range antiferromagnet for which there exists a two - sublattice structure .",
    "the groundstate of the antiferromagnet is not exactly given by the classical nel state which one would expect from the ising model .",
    "the spin - flip term leads to a finite density of flipped spins ( approximately 20% ) which give rise to a lowering of the magnetization .",
    "it also leads to spin - waves .",
    "these spin - waves destroy the long - range antiferromagnetic order at any finite temperature . however",
    ", one can define a correlation length and on distances smaller than this length , we can still speak about local antiferromagnetic order . for @xmath148 , we have local order with a correlation length that decreases with increasing temperature . therefore",
    ", thinking in terms of an ising model is not completely incorrect as long as one keeps in mind that there is a finite density of flipped spins in the lattice . in the remainder of this article",
    "we will neglect these spin flips .",
    "a moment s reflection reveals that @xmath149=0 $ ] for the hubbard model ( a property inherited to its descendents ) , and net magnetization is strictly preserved .",
    "consequently , if nel order prevails also when a single hole is introduced , hole motion is rigorosly restricted to one sublattice : if a hole could indeed hop to its neighboring site on the opposite sublattice , the magnetic quantum number @xmath150 would remain unaltered . on the other hand the two low energy `` vacuum '' states corresponding to the injection of a hole on the two different sublattices have magnetic quantum numbers @xmath150 differing by @xmath151 .",
    "these states obviously can not be connected by any of the magnetization conserving processes of @xmath152 .",
    "myriad analytical treatments of the @xmath11-@xmath12 and hubbard models were aware of this selection rule and have computed transition matrix elements for a single hole between sites of the same sublattice .",
    "for one example amongst many see @xcite .",
    "a well known argument leads to the conclusion that a single hole can not propagate freely in an antiferromagnet . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ figure : stringstates in an af . ] ) , whenever a non backtracking single hole moves from one sublattice to the other , it creates a string of flipped spins in its wake .",
    "this leads to a linear confining potential that strongly inhibits hole motion between different sublattices .",
    "this , however , is not the only process that can take place .",
    "( [ figure : hole moving in steps of 2 through an af ] ) shows that it is also possible for a hole to move two steps without creating a confining string potential .",
    "this is a second order process in perturbation theory .",
    "first we create a second hole two sites away from the first hole .",
    "we do this by moving that electron one site closer , next to the first hole .",
    "this gives rise to a double occupied intermediate state with a high energy @xmath8 .",
    "then , we let the same electron move again , now removing the first hole . the amplitude for the total process",
    "is given by @xmath153 , much smaller than @xmath7 , the first order hopping amplitude .",
    "however , the final state has exactly the same energy as the starting state .",
    "there are eight sites to which a single hole can hop in this fashion .",
    "note that throughout the entire process , the magnetic quantum number in fig .",
    "( [ figure : hole moving in steps of 2 through an af ] ) is preserved , e.g. @xmath154 if perfect",
    "nel order prevails everywhere around the fragment displayed in the figure for a lattice with an even number of sites . within the t - j and @xmath155 approximations to the hubbard model , same sublattice hops are more masked . in the t - j model ,",
    "only a third order process links a hole to one of its next nearest neighbors on the same sublattice .",
    "albeit holding for models derived from the hubbard model on bipartite lattices , in many instances the sublattice parity principle becomes much more alive and transparent within the original hubbard model itself .",
    "numerical simulations of the hubbard and heisenberg model with a single hole have found a discrete number of sharp peaks in the spectrum which could be identified with string - states * [ 25 - 43]*. the longer the string , the higher the energy of the peak . because there is a gap between the first and second peak",
    ", we can confine our attention to the lowest peak .",
    "this peak has a finite quasi - particle weight . the dispersion of this peak as a function of @xmath156 , tells us about the effective movement of a hole through an antiferromagnet .",
    "a recent numerical result from louis _ et .",
    "@xcite for this dispersion relation in the hubbard model is shown in fig .",
    "( [ figure : dispersion relation for single hole + bandwith versus j ] ) .",
    "the central result of numerous investigations is that they all found that a sharp quasiparticle peak appears at the bottom of a broad continuum of the hole spectrum .",
    "these quasiparticle poles form a coherent hole band with a width of order of @xmath157 over a wide range of @xmath158 , and the coherent propagation is made possible by `` healing '' a string of flipped spins by quantum fluctuations .",
    "one can easily fourier transform the numerical low energy hole dispersion relation @xmath159 to unveil the important real space quasiparticle motions and their respective amplitudes .",
    "if we make the simplifying assumption that the hole is the quasiparticle then we find that essentially all of the low energy weight is distributed amongst the next nearest neighbor motions linking the hole to its sublattice .",
    "this is a consistent logical outcome of a strong local nel order fused with the fact that the magnetic moment is a conserved quantum number . that the nearest states on the same sublattice ( and those further away ) have the highest weight could hardly be surprising .",
    "hopping amplitudes to sites which are further and further away on the same sublattice drops significantly with distance @xcite .",
    "stated alternatively , if on the two dimensional lattice , the hopping amplitude to any of the four colinear sites ( twice ( up , down , right or left ) ) is @xmath160 and if motion to any of the four diagonal sites has amplitude @xmath161 ) then the dispersion relation will read      from lowest order perturbation theory @xcite , we immediately expect @xmath163 where the relative factor of two originates from the two paths by which we may reach diagonal sites by two consecutive hops as comparde to the single two step route to longintudinal next nearest neighbors . as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ figure : theoretical dispersion single hole ] ) , renormalized hopping amplitudes of the same order of magnitude @xmath164 reproduce the detailed and tedious numerical fits of fig .",
    "( [ figure : dispersion relation for single hole + bandwith versus j ] ) remarkably well . more generally , if one fourier transforms the elaborate data encoded in fig .",
    "( [ figure : dispersion relation for single hole + bandwith versus j ] ) we find that the bulk of the fourier weight corresponds to next to nearest neighbor motions with hopping amplitudes of the same order as anticipated from lowest order perturbation theory @xcite .    in accordance with expectations from perturbation theory , it is indeed found numerically that diagonal ( _ nodal _ ) hopping is almost twice as large in amplitude as compared to longitudinal hopping ( a property which might easily transcend to larger length scales by virtue of many of the small length scales in these materials ) with both amplitudes of order @xmath164 . in fig .",
    "( [ figure : theoretical dispersion single hole ] ) , we show the theoretical dispersion curves coming from equation ( [ equation : dispersion for hole in af ] ) for @xmath165 and @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "these curves capture all the essential features of the numerical dispersion curve shown in fig .",
    "( [ figure : dispersion relation for single hole + bandwith versus j ] ) .",
    "the very good fit obtained to the dispersion curve of a single hole in an antiferromagnet by introducing the three parameters ( @xmath117 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) suggests that the complicated problem of a single hole in an antiferromagnet can be reduced to a single particle problem .",
    "this is a major simplification .",
    "if we really can neglect spin - flips and string - states , the single hole problem has been reduced to a single - particle problem .",
    "the spins have become static and their only function is to create a checkerboard like sublattice structure that keeps the hole moving on only one sublattice by forcing it to move in steps of two .",
    "large @xmath91 means in principle both large @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "a large @xmath169 leads to spin - flips being relatively important and this will restore the string - states .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath91 , and thus of @xmath169 , leads to spin - flips which will restore a string to the normal antiferromagnet .",
    "however , the relevant region of the hubbard model and the @xmath11-@xmath12 model is the region of small values of @xmath91",
    ".    stated in more general terms , the constraint on the motion of the holes ( equivalent to the assumption of nel order ) may be regarded as a low energy selection rule on the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the total @xmath170 component of spin ( sublattice parity order ) is a conserved quantum number and transitions between different sublattice states are banned .",
    "whenever nel order is strong , the states are effectively separated into two disjoint hilbert spaces each for a different sublattice parity ( magnetic @xmath171 ) quantum number .",
    "as we demonstrate in the main text , stripe order may be interpreted as an immediate consequence of sublattice parity quantum numbers .",

    "we will further assume that there is a phase - shift in the staggered antiferromagnetic order parameter as we traverse the stripe .",
    "this implies that there is a seam of ferromagnetic bonds between spins on the two different legs of the stripe .",
    "the ferromagnetic bonds will cost a lot of energy .",
    "however , introducing holes into the stripe will reduce this strain .",
    "the ferromagnetic bonds will turn out to be essential to explain the stability of stripes against `` hole evaporation '' .    in order to understand why a system would want to form such a stripe",
    ", we make the theoretical assumption that the system starts out with an antiphase boundary as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : af with a domain wall without holes ] .",
    "theoretically , one can force such a system by imposing suitable boundary conditions .",
    "if the system is @xmath18 sites long , this will entail an energy penalty of , approximately , @xmath19 .",
    "introducing holes into this system will reduce the energy of this ferromagnetic seam and ameliorate matters .",
    "topologically , stripes are not literally domain walls in an antiferromagnet ( whose spins @xmath20 are continuous variables and _ not _ ising like ) but rather topological excitations of the antiferromagnet known as skyrmions . as noted by wilczek and zee @xcite and later incorporated by others in rather novel theories , e.g. wiegmann @xcite , skyrmions in an antiferromagnet",
    "are cylindrical domains separating nel states shifted by half a period .",
    "we note that topologically , stripes are identical to skyrmions stretched out to form domain walls spanning the entire lattice .",
    "berry phase effects in the antiferromagnet associated with domain wall stripes can give rise to exotic statistics similar to that of skyrmions in 2 + 1 dimensions- as suggested by extending the results of @xcite to our domain walls .",
    "we now examine what happens if we introduce a hole into the antiferromagnet with a domain wall ( see fig . [",
    "figure : hole in af + domain wall ] ) . once again",
    ", our major assumption still is that this hole moves in steps of two such that it will always stay on the same sublattice .",
    "we reiterate a note for the experts : our analysis has nothing to do with string states and kink ( wiggle ) motion beautifuly analyzed by many @xcite , and many of the works in @xcite ( our point of departure -the sublattice parity principle- is just a way to explicitly avoid high energy string states from the outset ) .",
    "nor , does our bare analysis have anything to do with the role of the magnetic alleviation energies for a hole drifting into the stripe ( whereby it removes bad ferromagnetic bonds ) which plays the role of an effective attractive potential .",
    "such effects will only enhance the bare findings that we report here .    with these remarks in mind , we note that if the hole is in the antiferromagnet , far away from the stripe , it has eight positions were it can move to ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : hole in af + domain wall ] ) .",
    "if it is sitting next to the boundary ( just outside the stripe ) , it loses one hop , because of the reversed sublattice structure .",
    "the remaining seven hops are all the same as if the boundary was not there",
    ".    larger changes happen with a hole located within the stripe .",
    "for such a hole there are only six hops left . in fig .",
    "[ figure : hole in af + domain wall ] , the hole on the stripe can not move downward left or downward right because of the change in sublattice structure .",
    "so , naively , one might come to the conclusion that a hole has more kinetic energy in the antiferromagnet then if it is on or near the boundary / stripe .",
    "naively , confinement of the hole in the stripe would cost kinetic energy .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "the reason is that within the antiferromagnet the holes can only move in two steps longitudinally with an amplitude @xmath21 or diagonally with an amplitude @xmath22 which are of the order of @xmath23 ( the uniniated reader is refered to appendix([sub_prin ] ) for an exposure to the origin of the exchange coupling @xmath12 ) . on the stripe",
    "the hole can stay on the same sublattice by doing a single ( instead of double ) step up or down with amplitude @xmath7 . as a consequence ,",
    "the hole has a much larger kinetic energy if it is situated on the stripe .",
    "therefore we find that the hole automatically drifts toward the stripe : the amplitude for the ground state wavefunction is maximal for sites on the stripe and decays exponentially the further the sites are away from the strip ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : decay perp to stripe ] ) .",
    "holes are driven by an increase in kinetic energy ( not exchange energy ) to the domain wall .",
    "we term this mechanism `` _ dynamical confinement _ '' .",
    "the word dynamical is used because it is the motion of the holes on the stripe that lowers the energy .",
    "the primary role of kinetic energy in favoring the stripe as a ground state has been discussed many times before , e.g. @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the trivial ( yet sizable ) lowering of the kinetic energy allowed by hole motion along the ferromagnetic rungs on the domain wall seems to have gone unnoticed .",
    "for the two dimensional problem of a single hole in the vicinity of a full domain wall embedded in a surrounding antiferromagnet ( of the variant shown in fig .",
    "( [ figure : hole in af + domain wall ] ) ) , we may work in a very much reduced hilbert space . in effect",
    ", the strongly correlated many particle system reduces to a single particle problem defined on half of the lattice . as there are , _ ab initio _ , four possible electronic states on each site ( empty , one electron with its spin up , an electron with spin down , and an up and down electronic pair ) , the hilbert space of an @xmath24 site system is , trivially , of dimension @xmath25 .",
    "invoking the sublattice parity principle allows us to reduce the hilbert space to a mere size of @xmath26 .",

    "this leads to an exponential decay of the lowest eigenstates states out of the stripe .",
    "we have numerically diagonalized a 12 x 21 system with a direct nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath37 , effective longitudinal and diagonal next nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes @xmath38 within the antiferromagnet , and a next nearest neighbor amplitude along the axis of the stripe ( ladder ) @xmath39 .",

    "if we were to allow a hole on the particle to hop to a larger number of neighbors within the bulk ( i.e. to artificially enhance kinetic motions and lower confining tendencies ) , then we may map our system into the dynamics of pseudo - spin 1/2 particles in the presence of a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the mapping is as follows : let us mark each point within the bulk by its sublattice parity ( up / down ) number as depicted in fig.([figure : hole in af + domain wall ] ) .",

    "these allow hoppings of the holes off and on the stripes which are disallowed- such additional terms can only enhance delocalization tendencies .",

    "( [ equek ] ) shows that , for unphysically large @xmath83 ( a strong influence of the surrounding two - dimensional antiferromagnet ) , the hilbert space splits up in four different sectors .",

    "the other half have the hole on the wrong sublattice , with an energy of @xmath85 . because the upper and lower leg of the ladder are exactly equivalent , the electron will slosh back and forth between the upper and lower legs .",

    "we can easily read off that the effective hopping is in steps of two from the @xmath90 term .",
    "because we are in the large @xmath91 limit , the hopping amplitude in second order perturbation theory is given by @xmath92 .",
    "we have to hop twice ( @xmath93 ) over an intermediate state with energy @xmath94 .",

    "there are two possible ways of doing this , and the amplitude again is @xmath92 .",
    "thus , we can intuitively understand every term in this limit .",
    "there is a gap of @xmath96 separating the lowest hubbard band from the antibonding states .",
    "because @xmath96 is a very large energy scale ( approximately 0.5 ev , or 5000 k ) , we can neglect the influence of the other sectors and may restrict our attention only to the lowest sector .    our discussion above hinged on the assumption that @xmath91 is very big ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this assumption is not satisfied in the physically relevant region wherein @xmath98 . in the physically relevant regime",

    "we now examine one hole in an otherwise full ladder immersed in a staggered external magnetic field .",
    "the single spin problem was very simple to solve analytically given our assumptions .",
    "the single hole problem is exceedingly more difficult because it is a strongly interacting many body problem . for a system of only @xmath101 sites , there are already approximately @xmath102 states ! systems of this size and larger may be addressed by employing the lanczos method of diagonalization , which only finds the lowest eigenstates of a matrix .",

    "though not the physically relevant regime , just as in section ( vii ) , both for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the ground state is in the same sector of hilbert space .    for large values of @xmath12 , the basic properties are once again those of a single quasiparticle . from the outside , we again assume that the hole can not leave the stripe .",

    "this bandwidth is given by @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",

    "the band , shifted down by @xmath112 by virtual hopping , has the dispersion of an inverted cosine .",
    "the gap @xmath113 , separating the on - stripe states from those in the surrounding antiferromagnet , is large with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "the spins adjust to surrounding antiferromagnetic . in the @xmath115 limit ,      the motion of a single hole on a stripe and its motion in a two dimensional antiferromagnet is identical .",
    "the only difference between the parameter sets , is sparked by the presence of the direct hopping term @xmath11 allowed within the topological domain wall .",
    "this is in contrast to one dimensional effective theories that assume that the hole effectively becomes a holon on a stripe ( see for instance tchernyshyov and pryadko @xcite ) .",
    "our hole is not a holon in the sense that it will remember if it was injected for a spin up or a spin down electron : they move on diffent sublattices .",
    "we see that we can consider a single hole on a stripe as a quasiparticle , just as a single electron on an empty lattice",
    ". they can both be characterized by ( different ) values for @xmath117 and @xmath5 .",
    "the main difference between a hole on a full ladder and an electron on an empty ladder is that the hole moves more slowly , because it can only move through double occupied intermediate states , which costs a lot of energy .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 is small for a hole , while it is large for an electron on an empty lattice .",
    "our main conclusion is that a single hole and a single electron are effectively identical .",
    "the equivalence between holes and electrons is no longer true for more than one particle .",
    "we will show that the low energy properties for two electrons are different from those of two holes .",

    "various possible geometries are sketched in fig .",

    "because only the relative distance is important , we keep the position of the up spin fixed",
    ".    the two electrons can be on the same or opposite legs .",
    "six amplitudes : @xmath118 and @xmath119 , defined in fig .",
    "( [ figure : geo on 1 dim ] ) , are of relevance .",
    "we notice that the hopping amplitude for the electrons when they are far apart ( @xmath47 ) is much larger than the hopping amplitude when they are next to each other ( @xmath120 ) . if they are far apart , they do not notice each other .",
    "two electrons have less kinetic freedom if they are next to each other . in order to move passed each other , they have to go through a doubly occupied state .          therefore , the ground state consists of electrons that are as far apart as possible .",
    "( [ figure : two electron on ladder ] ) shows a schematic picture for the density of states . only at the higher energies of the lowest hubbard band",
    "do we find pairs .",
    "the pairs have a small bandwidth because of the small hopping amplitude .",
    "once again we find various sectors as shown in fig .",
    "( [ figure : two electron on ladder ] ) .",
    "to see the difference between electrons and holes , we now look at two holes in a filled ladder .",
    "when far apart , two holes ( quasiparticles ) do not notice each other . just as for two electrons on an empty lattice , there are two states in which they strongly influence each other .",
    "the main question we wish to address is whether two holes come together and form a real - space pair , or if they tend to be as far apart as possible .",
    "if the two holes are far apart , they will move independently with an amplitude @xmath123 ( see fig .",
    "( [ figure : two holes moving indep on two - leg ladder ] ) ) . however , this is different if they are sitting next to each other . in this case",
    "no double occupied state is needed .",
    "therefore the hopping amplitude @xmath124 , thus @xmath125 .      in the left subfigure , a spin up electron moves left .",
    "the intermediate state in the middle figure has a higher energy of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "from this position , the electron with spin up can move back to the starting position , or it can move on to end up as shown in the right figure .",
    "once it is there , the hole - pair has effectively moved one site to the right .",
    "this figure only illustrates one possible hopping sequence , there are also other possible ways of hopping . for discussions of pairing one",
    "should be careful with fermionic minus signs sparked by the interchange of identical spins once a pair is made to go around @xcite .",
    "for the movement of a single hole , there is an intermediate state with an energy of @xmath8 . however , if the two holes are next to each other then the intermediate state will not have a doubly occupied site , so therefore this energy is only of the order of @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , @xmath127 is much large than @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to the formation of pairs on the stripe .",
    "the motion of the pairs on a ladder and the motion of single holes is coupled : both are present in the lowest hubbard sector .",
    "if they form disjoint hilbert spaces , we will find @xmath130 for the real space pair .",
    "for two single holes , @xmath131 , within perturbation theory . because @xmath47 is very small , the spectrum for single hole states does not exhibit much dispersion . taking the energy values from eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) , the dispersion for two holes on a stripe with staggered potentials is suspected to look like that shown in fig .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "the big difference between holes and electrons is that for two electrons the separated electrons have a large bandwidth and the pairs of electrons are a high energy state with a small dispersion . for holes",
    "this is reversed : the pairs have the largest bandwidth , while the separated electrons form a low energy excitation ( string states ) with a small dispersion .",
    "if we think of a hybridization of up and down sites along the rungs , then no possible interchange can be performed between the holes leading to fermionic minus signs that elevate , rather than depress , the pairing energy @xcite .",
    "lowest order perturbation theory for two holes on a staggered ladder leads to the dispersion shown in fig . ( 15 ) .",
    "the ground state properties can not be easily determined because of the overlap between separate hole and pair states .",
    "to test this situation numerically , we have performed standard lanczos calculations for the hubbard model endowed with staggered boundary conditions on a twelve site single chain with staggered boundary conditions . solving this problem for large two leg ladders",
    "is inhibited by the large hilbert space .",
    "the maximum size which we are able to examine numerically is a @xmath135 system for which there are @xmath136 states .",
    "such a system is too small to observe single hole states and pairs accurately . because of the strong bonding combination between the upper and lower leg of the ladder , the reduction to a one dimensional line is physically justified .",
    "the results of the lanczos calculation show that the ground state has the largest amplitude for pair states with only a small admixture of single hole states . immediately above the ground state ,",
    "the excited states are predominantly single hole states .",
    "there is a finite energy gap separating the ground state and these excited states .",
    "because of the small lattice size , we can not determine the value of the energy gap @xmath137 .",
    "another approach is to assume that @xmath138 , @xmath5 , and @xmath119 are adjustable parameters . in that case",
    ", we can perform a simplified calculation on a @xmath139 ladder having twenty spin up , and twenty spin down sites . in the aftermath , this leads to a @xmath140 matrix that can be easily diagonalized . using this model",
    "it is relatively easy to choose the effective parameters such that the cosine band for the pairs has a lower energy than the states where we have single holes far apart .",
    "our numerical results for the lanczos method suggest that the gap @xmath141 separating pair states and single particle states is sufficiently large for the groundstate to consist mostly of pair states .",
    "nontheless , as the gap separating the single hole and pair states is small , the pairing physics is , a priori , susceptible to the addition of longer range interactions and hopping interactions . such effects could easily tip the balance between the single hole and pair states ( or enhance pairing tendancies ) .",
    "we found that if we assume that somehow the antiferromagnet has a ferromagnetic domain wall , holes will automatically localize on this topological line .",
    "furthermore we looked at the movement of a single hole on this staggered ladder and found that it behaves as a single quasiparticle that moves along the ladder in steps of two .",
    "two electrons on an empty lattice try to be as far apart as possible .",
    "two holes on an otherwise halffilled ladder , however , form a bound pair . fusing all of these findings together , we obtain the stripes as seen by the dmrg calculations of white and scalapino @xcite . the arguments that we employed throughout were very pedestrian and general .",
    "throughout we invoked the sublattice parity principle and the related staggering potentials .",
    "our findings are further supported by numerical calculations on the @xmath11-@xmath12 model .",
    "we give a very simple physical interpretation for the stripes found by dmrg .",
    "a hole is on the stripe will delocalize by the hybridization of the upper and lower leg . if we place a hole on the upper leg , the hole will almost immediately jump to the lower leg and vice verse . in numerical calculations , we will therefore find the linear superposition of a hole and the electron depicted in fig .",
    "( [ dmrg ] ) .",
    "white and scalapino employed the dmrg technique on the @xmath11-@xmath12 model @xcite .",
    "( [ figure : white and scalapino dmrg calculation result ] ) shows one of their well known results .",
    "we see that the bond centered stripes are very narrow .",
    "they look like a ferromagnetic seam in an antiferromagnet .",
    "the same result can be obtained in mean - field theory @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "( [ 4kf density wave picture ] ) .",
    "the dmrg calculations of white and scalapino vividly show how spin and charge nestle .",
    "white and scalapino place much emphasis on the fact that again the holes are on next - nearest neighbor sites . on the opposite diagonal , the spins ( which are on the same sublattice )",
    "have a very strong antiferromagnetic bonding . in effect , the bound pair is creating a flip in the antiferromagnetic lattice .",
    "this might also explain why in the exact calculations and the monte - carlo results the binding energy would decrease as a function of the lattice size .",
    "basically , the hole - pair is creating an antiphase boundary , whose energy is increasing as a function of lattice size .",
    "that this is indeed a good representation of stripes follows from dmrg calculations by white and scalapino .",
    "the reader is urged to focus on the central part of their picture- the spin and charge texture towards the boundaries are more contorted by the open boundary conditions employed .",
    "we will assume that fig .",
    "( [ 4kf density wave picture ] ) is a useful real - space representation of quarter - filled stripes .",
    "we claim that the reason that the mean - field @xcite and the dmrg calculation are so similar has to do with the fact that the antiferromagnet is very strongly ordered .",
    "the stripes are so narrow because of _ dynamical confinement_.",
    "\\(i ) we assumed , self consistently , the existence of an antiphase domain wall having the geometry of a two leg ladder .",
    "sublattice parity ( @xmath16 ) order was assumed to prevail throughout the entire system .",
    "it should be noted ( especially in the context of assumption ( ii ) ) , that the small energy differences we found separating various contending states ( as well as those separating , say , bond centered stripes from site centered stripes ) are very susceptible to additional terms in the hamiltonian .    the hubbard model or its @xmath11-@xmath12 truncuation is only a model .",
    "there are myriad very important effects that it does not include which could easily shift the balance between various nearly degenerate contending states .",
    "coulomb effects ( which are much greater importance here than elsewhere given the poor screening in these materials ) enhance and stabilize stripe order : a uniform charge density order is strictly forbidden by the divergent coulomb penalty that it will incur .",
    "this point has been emphasized by emery , kivelson , and coworkers @xcite,@xcite .",
    "fourier transforming the hamiltonian and looking for the minimizing waveumbers , we are able to see how the charge density modulations will evolve and lead to stripe order @xcite once lattice effects are taken into account .",
    "even if the stripe correlations found by the dmrg calculations of white and scalapino on the pure @xmath11-@xmath12 model are found to be due to open boundary condition effects , when long range coulomb interactions are introduced , charge stripe order will be further stabilized .",
    "given the natural coupling between spin and charge @xcite , this will further enhance the sublattice parity flips across the stripe that we assumed from the outset ( assumption ( i ) ) .",
    "less emphasized are the role of higher order kinetic terms .",
    "these can easily tip the balance : a next nearest neighbor hopping increases pairing significantly . within the pure @xmath11-@xmath12 model ( with a vanishing direct diagonal hopping amplitude @xmath142 ) pairing correlations are infinitesimal and are further frustrated by the @xmath143 phase shift across the domain wall .",
    "numerically , @xmath144 which allows holes to move on the same sublattice enhances pairing dramatically . furthermore ,",
    "numerically , a negative @xmath144 is seen to favor stripe formation @xcite .",
    "we examined the consequences of hole motion in a strongly ordered antiferromagnet .",
    "we show that holes move to antiferromagnetic domain walls and effectively form two - leg ladders .",
    "this _ dynamical confinement _ of holes onto the stripe is caused by the sublattice structure of the antiferromagnet and the increase in kinetic energy on a domain wall .",
    "the effective two - leg ladders still feel the influence of the surrounding antiferromagnet in terms of a staggered boundary potential . as shown by krotov , lee , and balatsky@xcite , this increases the tendency to superconductivity .",
    "the reason for this is that holes on the stripe form real - space pairs .",
    "our results naturally lead to a theoretical description of the numerical results of white and scalapino .",
    "therefore , our starting assumption- the sublattice parity principle- and the neglect of string states that it entails might have some validity .",
    "our article furnishes yet another example of a kinetic theory @xcite- string states and magnetic ( potential ) effects of the like are not the immediate driving force for stripe formation and hole dynamics within our scheme .    in a upcoming paper",
    "we will show that these real - space pairs can be mapped to an effective one - dimensional xxz model in a transverse field .",
    "this will allow us to discuss the filling fractions of stripes .",

    "<S> when applied to a domain wall in an antiferromagnet , this simple effect naturally leads to a number of results . </S>",
    "<S> first , we demonstrate that the holes are immediately ( exponentially ) localized on stripes . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we show that the holes on a stripe favor the formation of pairs on neighboring rungs or sites . we recover in this way the well known pictures of stripes found by white and scalapino by numerical density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations . throughout this work much emphasis </S>",
    "<S> is placed on the problem of a two leg ladder immersed in a staggered magnetic field . </S>"
