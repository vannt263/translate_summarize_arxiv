    "the classical ising model on the lattice is one of the most studied models in mathematical physics with thousands of research papers since its introduction in 1925 . in his famous work from 1944 , onsager  @xcite exactly solved the model in two dimensions , thereby determining its critical temperature . ever since , physicists directed most of their attention to the fascinating behavior of the model at criticality ( see for instance the 20 volumes of  @xcite ) .",
    "in this regime the model on @xmath0 exhibits delicate fractal geometry whose rigorous understanding was only recently obtained using conformally invariant scaling limits . here",
    "we report the first rigorous confirmation that the spectral - gap of the glauber dynamics for the critical ising model in @xmath0 , perhaps the most practiced methods for sampling its gibbs distribution , is polynomial in the side - length .",
    "the glauber dynamics ( also known as the _ stochastic ising model _ ) is a family of markov chains introduced by glauber  @xcite in 1963 , which both models the dynamic evolution of the ising model and provides a simple algorithm for sampling from its stationary distribution .",
    "the most notable examples are the heat - bath dynamics and metropolis dynamics , both highly used in practice thanks to their simple and natural transition - rules .",
    "an extensive program of work by mathematicians , physicists and computer scientists has related the static spatial - mixing properties of the ising model to the mixing - rate of the glauber dynamics , measured in terms of the gap in the spectrum of its generator .",
    "relying on many experiments and studies in the theory of dynamical critical phenomena , the spectral - gap of the dynamics on a finite box in the lattice is conjectured to have the following _ critical slowdown _ behavior ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) :    at high temperatures the inverse - spectral - gap is @xmath1    at the critical @xmath2 it is polynomial in the side - length    at low temperatures it is exponential in the side - length    ( in dimensions @xmath4 the surface - area plays the role of the side - length ) .",
    "as we detail later , in a long series of seminal papers over the last three decades this rich interplay between the static and dynamic models was confirmed for the 2-dimensional ising model with the crucial exception of the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast to the detailed picture by now known for @xmath5 , the behavior of the inverse - gap at criticality remained a stubborn and fundamental open problem , with no known sub - exponential bounds .",
    "our main result establishes that the inverse - gap is indeed polynomial in the side - length , thereby confirming the critical slowdown behavior of the ising model on @xmath0 .",
    "[ thm-1 ] consider the critical ising model on a finite box @xmath6 of side - length @xmath7 , i.e.  at inverse - temperature @xmath8 .",

    "there exists an absolute constant @xmath11 ( independent of @xmath12 ) such that @xmath13 .    using well - known relations between @xmath14 and @xmath15 mixing ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    "an immediate corollary of our main result is that the total - variation mixing time of the glauber dynamics is bounded above by a polynomial in the side - length @xmath7 ( see corollary  [ cor - tmix ] in section  [ subsec : prelim - mix - l1l2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show a generalized version of the above theorem ( see theorem  [ thm - inverse - gap ] ) that applies to rectangles of unbounded aspect - ratio ( e.g. , an @xmath16 box ) , where the polynomial upper bound depends only on the shorter side - length .",
    "lower bounds on the inverse - gap can be derived already from the work of onsager , as observed by holley  @xcite , demonstrating that it grows at least polynomially fast with @xmath7 . following this approach we complement the above upper bound by showing that the inverse - gap is of order at least @xmath17 ( see theorem  [ thm - gap - lower - bound ] ) .",
    "no attempt was made to optimize the exponent @xmath11 given in theorem  [ thm-1 ] .",
    "as we later elaborate , our proof determines this bound explicitly in terms of a bound @xmath18 on the probability of a certain crossing event in the critical fortuin - kasteleyn representation of the ising model ( namely , the dependence on @xmath19 is logarithmic ) .",
    "the true exponent is believed to be universal and numerical experiments supporting this @xcite ( among others ) suggest that its value is about @xmath20 .      in what follows",
    "we give a brief account of related work on the stochastic ising model . for a more extensive exposition ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the classical ising model on a finite box @xmath21 in the square lattice @xmath0 with no external field is defined as follows .",
    "its set of possible configurations is @xmath22 , where each configuration corresponds to an assignment of plus / minus spins to the sites in @xmath21 .",
    "the probability that the system is in a configuration @xmath23 is given by the gibbs distribution @xmath24 where the partition function @xmath25 is a normalizing constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is the inverse - temperature of the system ; for @xmath27 we say that the model is ferromagnetic , otherwise it is anti - ferromagnetic .",
    "these definitions extend to the infinite volume lattice @xmath0 , where there is a critical point @xmath28 such that the gibbs distribution is unique if and only if @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the focus of this work is restricted to the case of no external field ( @xmath30 ) since otherwise there is no phase - transition in the above setting and the dynamics for the system is well understood .    define the boundary of a set @xmath31 , denoted by @xmath32 , as the neighboring sites of @xmath21 in @xmath33 and call @xmath34 a boundary condition .",
    "the gibbs distribution conditioned on @xmath10 will be denoted by @xmath35 , and put @xmath36 .",
    "a periodic boundary condition on a box corresponds to a @xmath37-dimensional torus .",
    "the glauber dynamics for the ising model is a family of continuous - time markov chains on the state space @xmath38 , reversible with respect to the gibbs distribution , given by the generator @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the configuration @xmath41 with the spin at @xmath42 flipped .",
    "the transition rates @xmath43 are chosen to satisfy finite range interactions , detailed balance , positivity and boundedness and translation invariance ( see section  [ sec : prelim ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the two most notable examples for the choice of transition rates are    a.   _ metropolis _ : @xmath44 .",
    "b.   _ heat - bath _ : @xmath45^{-1}\\;$ ] .",
    "these chains have intuitive and useful graphical interpretations : for instance , the heat - bath glauber dynamics is equivalent to updating the spins via i.i.d .",
    "rate - one poisson clocks , each time resetting a spin and replacing it by a sample according to the conditional distribution given its neighbors .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental property of the dynamics is the gap in the spectrum of its generator , which governs the rate of convergence of the glauber dynamics to equilibrium in @xmath46 .",
    "the spectral - gap is defined via the following dirichlet form : @xmath47 where the infimum is over all nonconstant @xmath48 and @xmath49 ^ 2\\,.\\label{eq - def - e(f)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alternatively , one may define the gap via the discrete - time analogue of the chain , in which case it is given in terms of the largest nontrivial eigenvalue of the transition kernel .",
    "we next present a partial list of results obtained on the spectral - gap in various temperature regimes over the last half - century .      a series of breakthrough papers by aizenman , dobrushin , holley , shlosman , stroock et al.(cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) beginning from the late 1970 s has developed the theory of the convergence rate of the glauber dynamics to equilibrium .",
    "aizenman and holley  @xcite showed that the spectral gap of the dynamics on the infinite - volume lattice is uniformly bounded whenever the dobrushin - shlosman uniqueness condition holds .",
    "stroock and zegarliski  @xcite proved that the logartihmic - sobolev constant is uniformly bounded given the dobrushin - shlosman mixing conditions ( complete analyticity ) .",
    "finally , in 1994 martinelli and olivieri @xcite extended this result to cubes under the more general condition of _ regular _ complete analyticity , shown to hold for any @xmath50 in two dimensions . in particular , this confirmed the conjectured behavior of the inverse - gap in the high temperature regime in @xmath0 .",
    "this spectral - gap was shown to determine the precise asmyptotics of the @xmath14 mixing time of the dynamics in the recent work  @xcite , where the authors established the cutoff phenomenon for the dynamics in this regime .",
    "see the excellent surveys @xcite for further details .      in this regime , in accordance with the conjectured critical slowdown behavior of the ising model , the glauber dynamics under the free boundary condition was expected to converge exponentially slowly in the side - length .",
    "this was first established by schonmann  @xcite in 1987 for sufficiently low temperatures as a direct corollary from a large deviation estimate on the magnetization in a square .",
    "this large deviation result was extended to any @xmath51 by chayes , chayes and schonmann  @xcite , implying that the inverse - gap under free boundary conditions is at least @xmath52 for some @xmath53 .",
    "this result , concurring with the projected behavior of the inverse - gap in this regime , also appeared explicitly and independently by thomas  @xcite .    in 1995 ,",
    "precise large deviation rate functions for the magnetization were established by ioffe  @xcite for all @xmath51 .",
    "building on the work of martinelli  @xcite ( treating low enough temperatures ) , this then culminated in remarkably sharp estimates for the inverse - gap throughout the low temperature regime in the work of cesi , guadagni , martinelli and schonmann  @xcite in 1996 .",
    "evidence that the inverse - gap is at least polynomial in the side - length at the critical temperature followed from the polynomial decay in the spin - spin correlation , whose asymptotics were determined by onsager  @xcite . on the other hand , despite the vast body of papers that accumulated on the non - critical regimes , no sub - exponential upper bound was known for the inverse - gap at criticality .    in fact , the only geometries where the inverse - gap of dynamics for the critical ising model was shown to be polynomial ( in the appropriate parameter for the given underlying geometry ) were the complete graph  @xcite , where the large symmetry renders the methods of proof useless for lattices , and the regular tree  @xcite , whose non - amenability and non - transitivity also require geometry - specific methods .",
    "even for these much simpler geometries the proofs were highly nontrivial .",
    "indeed , the complexity of the critical behavior can be witnessed by the scaling limit of the static ising model . the understanding of the limit emerged in the last decade , pioneered by the introduction of the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) by schramm  @xcite ( see  @xcite for more on sles ) .",
    "this powerful machinery has revolutionized the study of critical phenomena in two dimensions and allowed direct calculation of various critical exponents ( see for instance @xcite to name just a few ) .",
    "striking new results by smirnov ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) describe the full scaling limit of the ising cluster interfaces at criticality as the conformal loop ensemble ( cle ) with parameter @xmath54 ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "an important role in the development of the scaling limit theory for the ising model was played by its counterpart , the fortuin - kasteleyn representation ( formally defined in section  [ sec : prelim ] ) . scaling limit results that were initially obtained for this model at criticality",
    "were thereafter translated to the corresponding ising measure .",
    "for instance , the full ensemble of cluster interfaces in the fk - ising model converges to a ( nested ) @xmath55 for @xmath56 . along side",
    "the ground breaking results on critical percolation models in two dimensions , new tools were developed to study conformally invariant systems .",
    "a recent application of this theory yielded russo - seymour - welsh type estimates ( @xcite ) for the crossing probability in a rectangle of bounded aspect ratio in the critical fk - ising model under arbitrary boundary conditions , recently obtained by duminil - copin , hongler and nolin  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for this result under a specific boundary condition , as well as  @xcite for an argument inferring the general estimate from announced results on the convergence of the scaling limit of the spin cluster boundaries to @xmath57 and from its brownian loop soup representation .",
    "as we later state , the rsw - estimate of  @xcite is a key ingredient in our proof .    as a consequence of theorem  [ thm-1 ] , which verifies the conjectured polynomial behavior of the inverse - gap at criticality ,",
    "the critical slowdown of the ising model in 2 dimensions is now fully established .",
    "recall that theorem  [ thm-1 ] bounded the inverse - gap for any fixed boundary condition .",
    "our proof in fact extends to free or periodic boundary conditions as well as mixed boundary conditions ( see theorem  [ thm - free - periodic ] ) .",
    "furthermore , by a standard reduction the result also carries to the anti - ferromagnetic ising model ( see corollary  [ cor - antiferro ] ) .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this gives the first rigorous polynomial - time algorithm for approximately sampling the critical ising model in @xmath0 , also leading to an approximation of its partition - function , under _ arbitrary _",
    "( e.g.  mixed ) boundary conditions .",
    "( in the absence of boundary conditions jerrum and sinclair provided an efficient approximation scheme for the ising partition - function on any graph in their celebrated work  @xcite .",
    "based on this algorithm randall and wilson  @xcite gave an efficient approximate sampler for the ising model on general graphs in 1999 , applicable whenever the boundary conditions are free / all - plus / all - minus or periodic . )      in their highly influential work  @xcite , propp and wilson introduced the method _ perfect simulation _",
    "( or coupling from the past ) to exactly sample from the stationary measure of certain markov chains .",
    "perhaps their most prominent application for this method was sampling the ising model at criticality via glauber dynamics .",
    "while the propp - wilson algorithm is guaranteed to produce a precise sample from the ising measure , it was not rigorously shown to be efficient , that is to have an expected running time polynomial in the size of the lattice .",
    "the only guarantee given for the running time was in terms of the total - variation mixing time , which was unknown at criticality .",
    "note that experimental results found the method to be extremely effective in this regime ( a fact that served as additional supporting evidence that the inverse - gap of the dynamics is polynomial at @xmath3 ) .    by the new results in this work ( namely , corollary  [ cor - tmix ] ) we now have the first proof that the propp - wilson algorithm runs in polynomial time .",
    "this constitutes the first rigorously proven efficient algorithm ( in addition to being very simple ) for perfectly simulating the critical ising model on the square lattice .",
    "furthermore , this algorithm is valid under arbitrary boundary conditions .      a common feature of most analyses of the glauber dynamics is to utilize the spatial - mixing properties of the static ising model in order to control the mixing rate of the dynamical process . in the high temperature regime , this is typically done by measuring the influence of individual boundary condition spins on sites and its rate of decay with distance .",
    "however , at the critical temperature , the slow decay of correlations precludes this approach . indeed , as demonstrated by the spin - spin correlation result of onsager and further illustrated by the existence with positive probability of `` large '' conformal loops as ising cluster interfaces , there are long - range correlations at criticality which foil the standard coupling techniques .",
    "instead , we apply ideas from the study of the conformal invariance of the ising model , and crucially the rsw - type estimate of  @xcite , to obtain the spatial - mixing result required for our analysis ( theorem  [ thm - spatial - mix ] ) . rather than considering the effect of a single spin on the boundary , here we analyze the effect of an entire face of the boundary , deducing just enough spatial mixing to push our program through , with the help of additional ingredients from the analysis of markov chains , in particular the block - dynamics method  @xcite .",
    "throughout the paper we will use the notation @xmath58\\cap { \\mathbb z}$ ] , whereby for instance a square lattice of side - length @xmath7 can be denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "the glauber dynamic for the ising model on a finite box @xmath6 , whose generator is given in , accepts any choice of transition rates @xmath43 which satisfy the following :    1 .   _ finite range interactions _ : for some fixed @xmath60 and any @xmath61 , if @xmath62 agree on the ball of diameter @xmath63 about @xmath42 then @xmath64 .",
