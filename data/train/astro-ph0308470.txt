    "radio observations have indicated that supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the most likely sources of cosmic - ray electrons in the energy region below @xmath2  gev .",
    "evidence for non - thermal x - ray emission from the supernova remnant sn1006 discovered with the asca satellite @xcite strongly supports the hypothesis that galactic cosmic - ray electrons in the tev region originate in supernovae . in this case , tev gamma - rays should be produced via the inverse compton process between accelerated electrons and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and indeed tev gamma - rays were detected by the cangaroo experiment @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for x - ray synchrotron emission is provided by observations of several other snrs , such as rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , cas a @xcite , ic443 @xcite , g374.3 - 0.5 @xcite , and rx j0852.0 - 4622 @xcite . in snr",
    "rx j1713.7 - 3946 , evidence for the acceleration of cosmic - ray protons is reported by @xcite from tev gamma - ray observations",
    ". however , there are also arguments that the tev gamma - rays observed can not be interpreted as hadronic in origin @xcite .    to clarify the origins of cosmic rays and their propagation mechanisms within the galaxy , electrons provide an ideal probe , complementary to the nucleonic component , due to their low mass and leptonic nature .",
    "high energy electrons lose energy primarily via synchrotron and inverse compton processes during propagation in the galaxy .",
    "these processes , combined with the absence of hadronic interactions , simplify modeling of the propagation of electrons compared with other cosmic - ray components such as nucleons . since the energy loss rate is almost proportional to @xmath3 ,",
    "higher energy electrons lose energy more rapidly .",
    "tev electrons lose most of their energy on a time scale of @xmath1yr , and their propagation distances are therefore limited to several hundred pc .",
    "measurements of cosmic - ray electrons in the tev region have been successfully performed only with emulsion chamber detectors @xcite .",
    "the observed energy spectra extend without cut - off up to @xmath4tev .",
    "this means that the observed tev electrons must have been accelerated in snrs at distances within several hundred pc , and at times within @xmath1 yr ago .",
    "several models have been proposed to describe cosmic - ray propagation in the galaxy , motivated by attempts to fit existing data on the heavy primary composition and spectra of different species assuming the same simple power - law source spectrum . among these models , it is believed that the diffusion model provides the most realistic description of the propagation .",
    "the solution for the electron density in the diffusion equation is derived by several authors ( e.g. @xcite and other references therein ) , under different boundary conditions for the galactic halo .    in a study of the propagation of cosmic - ray electrons , @xcite first pointed out that a continuous source distribution model is not valid in the energy region above 100gev , because the electron spectrum in that energy range depends upon the age and distance of a few local sources .",
    "he showed that high energy electrons over 100gev probably come from the vela x pulsar , and predicted a cutoff at @xmath02 tev in the energy spectrum .",
    "although various parameters for snrs and diffusion coefficients were not known very well at that time , the concepts proposed by the author has been accepted in later work .",
    "@xcite have investigated the electron spectrum in terms of contributions from discrete sources such as snrs distributed over the galaxy .",
    "their calculations apply in the the case of sources continuously active in time . they suggested that such sources must be located within a few hundred pc of the solar system to prevent radiative energy losses from inducing a premature cut - off in the energy spectrum .",
    "they took the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 @xmath6s@xmath7 , independent of energy , which is much smaller than recently accepted values in the energy region over 100  gev ( see section [ subsec : diffusion ] ) .",
    "they concluded that it is very unlikely that snrs are the only sources of cosmic - ray electrons in the energy range 1gev @xmath8 1tev , but this result seems due to the inappropriate value of the diffusion coefficient assumed by themselves .",
    "@xcite calculated the propagation of electrons from snrs , using a solution of the diffusion equation with a disk - shaped boundary condition .",
    "they showed that the tev electron spectrum would deviate from power - law behavior due to fluctuations caused by the small number of sources capable of contributing to the observed flux in the tev region .",
    "to explain the features of both energy spectrum and charge composition of electrons , @xcite suggested an approach that separates the contribution of one nearby source , with age @xmath9yr and distance 100pc , from the contributions of other galactic sources at distances over 1kpc . using this approach , @xcite calculated the electron energy spectrum in analytical form .",
    "they considered the energy - dependent diffusive propagation of electrons , assuming the diffusion coefficient @xmath10@xmath11s@xmath7 at 10 gev , increasing with energy as @xmath12 .",
    "they showed that the observed energy spectrum from sub - gev to tev energies can be explained by this model .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that , if cosmic - ray electrons are accelerated in snrs , the observed electron spectrum should be strongly time - dependent above 30 gev , due to poisson fluctuations in the number of snrs within a given volume and time interval .",
    "they assumed the diffusion coefficient @xmath13@xmath11s@xmath7 , and calculated 400 cases of spectra using a random distribution of snrs in space and time .",
    "they argued that in their model , an injection spectral index of 2.0 can not be rejected for the observed local electron flux at high energy , with a probability of 5% over all their calculated spectra .",
    "@xcite considered the model for cosmic - ray electron production in the supernova explosion and variants for the subsequent propagation . in their model ,",
    "electrons are accelerated throughout the snr life time of several @xmath14  yr , and after the cease of the acceleration process electrons leave the remnant .",
    "they simulated the electron spectra by taking the random distribution of sn in the galaxy and letting the electrons diffuse to the solar system .",
    "as pointed out in these works , at energy higher than @xmath01 tev , the propagation lifetime of electrons is so short that only a few cosmic - ray sources can contribute to the observed flux .",
    "thus one expects fluctuations in the local electron energy spectrum reflecting the contributions of these small number of discrete sources . to analyze fluctuations in the spectrum ,",
    "we use the method of separating the contributions of distant and nearby sources to the total flux of high energy electrons .",
    "although this approach was discussed by earlier authors ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , the main difference between the present and earlier works is that in this paper we took only known , observed local snrs as nearby sources .",
    "using information on the ages and distances of observed snrs in the neighborhood of the solar system , we could determine which sources contribute electrons most efficiently in a given energy range , and thus correlate individual sources with features of the electron spectrum .",
    "in addition , one would expect the high energy electron flux to be anisotropic if the most significant sources are nearby @xcite .",
    "this means that we can identify cosmic - ray electron sources from the analysis of the local electron spectrum together with anisotropies in arrival direction .    for this purpose , we calculated the electron energy spectra with the diffusion model in a semi - analytic approach , separating the contributions of distant and nearby sources . in this calculation",
    ", we particularly took into account of the effects of the delay of electron liberation from snrs after the explosion , as well as the deviation from a single power - law spectrum of electrons in snrs .",
    "as a result , we indicate that nearby snrs such as the vela , cygnus loop , or monogem are the most likely candidates for the sources of cosmic - ray electrons in tev region , depending on when the electrons are released from snrs .",
    "if these sources are proven to be the main contributors of high energy electrons , we can precisely analyze the propagation of tev electrons by comparing predicted results with observed electron spectra , and the degree of anisotropy in the direction of the sources .",
    "such analyses will yield more detailed information about the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays .",
    "according to shock - acceleration models , the maximum energy of accelerated electrons is limited , by the snr age , a free escape from the shock region of mhd turbulence , or synchrotron losses @xcite .",
    "analysis of the observed radio and x - ray spectra also indicates that the typical electron spectrum produced in a remnant is a power - law with a cut - off of @xmath15tev @xcite .",
    "therefore , we approximated an electron injection spectrum of a power - law with an exponential cut - off of the form of @xmath16 , as taken by these authors .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , it is also important to take account of when the accelerated electrons are liberated from the remnant after the explosion . from shock - acceleration theory ,",
    "it is suggested that the electrons are liberated from snrs in the termination of the shock , i.e. when the shock velocity has dropped to the mean ism alfven velocity and the remnant has been reduced in the ism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this time scale is @xmath1  yr .",
    "however , there are no clear observational evidences for the release time of the tev electrons from snrs . in the scenario of the snr origin of cosmic - ray electrons ,",
    "the accelerated tev electrons should be liberated from the remnant within @xmath17yr , or the acceleration process should operate till the last phase of snrs .",
    "this is because the life time of tev electrons in the remnant is estimated to be less than a few times of @xmath18yr due to synchrotron loss inside snrs with a magnetic field of 10@xmath19 g .",
    "therefore , we evaluated the cosmic - ray electron spectra , changing the electron release time @xmath20 from 0 to @xmath21  yr .",
    "high energy electrons above 10 gev lose their energy mainly via the synchrotron and inverse compton processes while propagating through the galaxy .",
    "the energy loss rate is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the electron energy , @xmath25 is the mass of electron , @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath27 is the magnetic field strength in the galaxy , @xmath28 is the energy density of interstellar photons , and @xmath29 is the cross - section for thomson scattering .",
    "this formula ( [ eq : b ] ) is valid when the inverse compton process is well approximated by the thomson scattering cross - section , but we need corrections from the klein - nishina formula for high energy electrons as described below .",
    "typically quoted values for the interstellar magnetic field are estimated from measurements of the zeeman splitting , the faraday rotation , or the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "the estimates from zeeman splitting and faraday rotation measurements refer only to the line of sight component of the magnetic field .",
    "they are also biased toward cold neutral and warm ionized regions , respectively . using the radio synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , the local magnetic field strength of @xmath30",
    "@xmath31 g is obtained as a more adequate value @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath32 means the magnetic field perpendicular to the electron velocity , that is @xmath33 . in this calculation , we adopted @xmath34 g for our galaxy .",
    "since the thomson scattering cross - section approximation is inadequate for high energy electrons , we evaluate the energy loss coefficient @xmath35 using the compton scattering cross - section in the following .",
    "the interstellar radiation field in the galaxy is dominated by three components : 2.7k cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , re - emitted radiation from dust grains , and stellar radiation .",
    "the energy densities of photons are 0.26  ev/@xmath36 for cmb , 0.20  ev/@xmath36 for re - emitted radiation from dust grains , and 0.45  ev/@xmath36 for stellar radiation , respectively @xcite . for inverse compton scattering",
    ", we calculated the klein - nishina cross - section accurately using the formula by @xcite .",
    "the resulting energy loss coefficient @xmath35 decreases gradually with energy as shown in figure [ fig : enelossb ] , where the radiation field is assumed to be isotropic . for electrons in the tev region , energy loss through interactions with",
    "the cmb dominates over the other two components .    in a diffusive propagation model ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient determines the travel distance of electrons in a given time .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath37 has been estimated by using the observed ratios of secondary to primary nuclei ( b / c ) by heao - c @xcite and voyager @xcite , and is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 the formula ( [ eq : lowd ] ) agrees well with the experimental data up to tens of gev . beyond 100gev ,",
    "there have been scarcely data on b / c until quite recently , and it was not clear whether the formula ( [ eq : lowd ] ) is applicable to the higher energy region or not .",
    "there are arguments that simple extrapolation of @xmath40 with @xmath41 gives too large diffusion coefficient in @xmath42  tev region to interpret the observed anisotropy of primary cosmic - rays less than @xmath43 ( @xcite and other references therein ) .",
    "thus , it has been argued that the increase of the diffusion coefficient with energy should become slower than @xmath41 at somewhere beyond tens of gev , and also that @xmath44 is plausible from a kolmogorov - type spectrum of turbulence in the interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , a recent work of emulsion chamber experiments with long balloon exposures has shown the data of b / c and ( secondary species of fe)/fe in tev region , which indicate that the diffusion coefficient is consistent with the change of @xmath45 from 0.6 to 0.3 between tens of gev and 1tev @xcite .",
    "hence we take @xmath46 as a plausible diffusion coefficient in tev region .",
    "the numerical values of 2 and 5 are derived from the assumption that the formula ( [ eq : lowd ] ) is valid up to 50  gev or 1  tev , respectively . with this assumption , the source spectral index @xmath47 is chosen to maintain @xmath48 .    since high energy electrons",
    "lose energy by synchrotron and inverse compton processes at the rate @xmath49 , electrons lose almost all of their energy @xmath24 after time @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , electrons observed with energy @xmath24 must have been accelerated within @xmath51 from the present .",
    "hence , the lifetime @xmath52 becomes progressively shorter with increasing energy . assuming @xmath34 g and taking the klein - nishina formula for compton process , the lifetime is @xmath53 . as an approximate treatment",
    ", electrons can diffuse a distance of @xmath54 during this time ; i.e. @xmath55kpc for @xmath56 at 1 tev . more precise estimate for @xmath57",
    "is given in the following section .",
    "in the diffusion model for the propagation of electrons in the galaxy , the electron density @xmath58 is given by the equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the electron source strength , and @xmath61 is the distance to sources from the solar system .",
    "we shall take into account the fact that the galactic disk , where the sources are distributed , is surrounded by a halo in which the cosmic rays are confined for a long time before they escape into intergalactic space .",
    "we assume that cosmic - ray electrons are bounded by two parallel planes at @xmath62 with the median plane being occupied by the galactic disk . the halo thickness , @xmath63 ,",
    "is estimated to be @xmath64kpc from @xmath65be observations from the het aboard the voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft @xcite , which is also consistent with the observed galactic radio emission structure @xcite .",
    "thus we need to consider solutions with these boundary conditions for further analysis .",
    "since the solar system is located at @xmath66 pc , quite near the median plane of the disk , and the sources are uniformly distributed in layer much thinner than the confinement domain , we put @xmath67 .",
    "assuming burst - like injection of electrons after the supernova explosion , the source term can be represented by @xmath68 the density of electrons , @xmath58 , from a point source with injection spectrum @xmath69 at a distance @xmath61 and time @xmath70 after the release of electrons from the remnant , is derived from the diffusion equation using the fourier transform , assuming the diffusion coefficient has the form @xmath71 . taking the boundary condition @xmath72 at the boundary of the galactic halo @xmath73 , the general solution of the equation ( [ eq : diffusion_eq ] ) in cylindrical coordinates is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76      integrating @xmath77 of the solution ( [ eq : accurate_sol ] ) with @xmath61 from 0 to @xmath78 , we derive @xmath79 in this calculation , we approximated the integration on @xmath61 to range from 0 to @xmath78 . since electrons can not propagate to larger distances than the halo thickness of @xmath63 in the radial direction , we may ignore the effects of the lateral distribution of the sources on the galactic disk . in integrating @xmath80 of the formula ( [ eq : cyl_net ] ) on @xmath70 from 0 to @xmath81",
    ", we need the numerical integration . in the case of @xmath82 , however , we can perform the integration with an analytical way , since the exponential cut - off term can be ignored .",
    "the solution is given by a confluent hyper - geometric function for each term in the series .",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 is a confluent hyper - geometric function and @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the supernova explosion rate in the galaxy per unit area and unit time .",
    "this analytic form is convenient to sum up many terms in the series .",
    "higher energy electrons can not reach the halo boundary due to their larger energy loss rate , and distribute around the galactic disk plane . therefore , we need to include the higher - order fourier components to estimate the flux of higher energy electrons .",
    "in fact , we need to add up to 10 terms at 10gev while up to @xmath87 terms at 10tev to get a precision of a few percent in the convergence of the series solution ( [ eq : cyl_sol ] ) . in order to simplify the calculation for the high energy region",
    ", we can use a three dimensional solution without boundary conditions instead of using the two dimensional solution ( [ eq : cyl_sol ] ) , which is given by ( e.g. @xcite and other references therein ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 the accuracy obtained by this approximation is discussed in appendix [ sec : app_a ] .",
    "the flux of electrons from sources continuously and uniformly distributed in the galactic disk is derived from the integration of electron density with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath70 in the following , @xmath90 in the low energy region , below 1 tev , many sources contribute to the observed electron flux . as the energy of the observed electrons increases ,",
    "the number of electron sources decreases and only nearby sources can contribute to the electron flux .",
    "as described in section [ subsec : diffusion ] , young cosmic - ray electron sources which are nearby create discrete effects in the tev region , such as structure in the electron spectrum and the anisotropy favoring the source direction .",
    "thus we can define the contribution from distant or relatively old sources by subtracting the flux of nearby young sources , eliminating the effects of fluctuations due to the small number of nearby sources , as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 show the flux of electrons from distant ( in space - time ) sources and nearby sources , respectively . here",
    ", we calculated the contribution of nearby sources distributed uniformly in space and time as @xmath94 appropriate values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 are discussed in section [ subsec : spec2data ] .",
    "as described in section [ sec : intro ] , recent x - ray and tev gamma - ray observations indicate that high energy electrons are accelerated in snrs . here , we assumed that snrs are cosmic - ray electron sources , and that electrons are liberated burst - likely from snrs at the time of @xmath97 , @xmath98  yr , @xmath99  yr , @xmath100  yr , and @xmath101  yr after the explosion . as described in section [ sec : result ] , the case of the continuous release is well approximated by the burst - like release with a mean value of the liberation time .    from the observations of sn1006 @xcite",
    ", the output energy in electrons above 1 gev is estimated to be @xmath102 erg .",
    "we can also estimate the net output energy for electrons from supernovae using the energy density of cosmic rays and the supernova rate of @xmath103 in the galaxy ( @xcite and other references therein ) .",
    "the output energy of electrons above 1 gev estimated in this way is about @xmath104 erg / sn , and is consistent with the estimate from sn1006 .",
    "therefore , we took the output energy from a supernova in electrons above 1 gev is @xmath105 erg .    to analyze contributions due to discrete cosmic - ray electron sources , we list in table [ tab : nearbysnrs ] all known snrs which are located within 1  kpc of the solar system and with age less than @xmath106  yr . for each source ,",
    "the maximum energy @xmath107 of electrons reaching the solar system is given by @xmath108 , with the energy loss coefficient @xmath35 shown in figure [ fig : enelossb ] and the age @xmath52 of each snr , which are determined independent of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "distance to snrs is an important parameter in evaluating the high energy electron flux , and we comment on this parameter of some snrs listed in table [ tab : nearbysnrs ] .",
    "so far , the canonical distance to the vela snr has been taken to be 500pc , a value which was derived from the analysis of its angular diameter in comparison with the cygnus loop and ic443 @xcite , and pulsar dispersion determination @xcite .",
    "however , recent parallax measurements clearly indicate that the distance of 500pc is too large .",
    "@xcite obtained high resolution ca - ii absorption line toward 68 ob stars in the direction of the vela snr .",
    "the distances to these stars were determined by trigonometric parallax measurements with the hipparcos satellite and spectroscopic parallaxes based upon photometric colors and spectral types .",
    "the distance to the vela snr is constrained to be @xmath109pc due to the presence of the doppler spread ca - ii absorption line attributable to the remnant along some lines of sight .",
    "@xcite also applied high - resolution astrometry to the vela pulsar ( psr b0833 - 45 ) @xmath110 optical counterpart . using hubble space telescope observations",
    ", they obtained the first optical measurement of the annual parallax of the vela pulsar , yielding a distance of @xmath111 pc .",
    "therefore , we calculate the electron flux adopting a distance of 300  pc to the vela snr .",
    "previously , a distance of 770 pc to the cygnus loop was often quoted @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that the distance is @xmath112 pc , based on hubble space telescope observations of a filament in the remnant .",
    "thus we took the distance to be 440 pc , considerably smaller than the previously quoted distance of 770 pc .",
    "for the recently discovered snr rx j0852.0 - 4622 , the estimated age of @xmath113yr and distance of @xmath114pc was based on thermal x - ray emission and @xmath115ti gamma - ray detection @xcite .",
    "however , asca observations reveal that the x - ray emission is non - thermal , and re - analysis of the comptel data indicates that the @xmath115ti gamma - ray detection is only significant at the @xmath116 level ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus it is suggested that rx j0852.0 - 4622 is at a larger distance , @xmath117kpc @xcite , so we do not include it in table [ tab : nearbysnrs ] .",
    "figure [ fig : age_distance ] shows contours of the expected electron flux at 3 tev ( with flux values scaled by @xmath118 ) as a function of age and distance of the snr . as described in the preceding section , we assumed that the output energy of electrons over 1 gev is @xmath119 erg / sn , and the injection spectrum is a power - law function with an exponential cut - off of the form of @xmath16 . the diffusion coefficient has the form @xmath120 @xmath11s@xmath7 , where @xmath121 is 0.3 in the tev region and the spectral index @xmath47 is chosen to maintain @xmath122 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : age_distance ] , the electron flux is strongly dependent on source age and distance . in the case of the prompt release of electrons after the explosion , the flux from the vela snr is the largest among the known snrs listed in table [ tab : nearbysnrs ] .",
    "the flux value is quite sensitive to the change of distance to vela from 500pc to 300pc , since the solution for electron density yields a gaussian distribution function of @xmath61 as shown in formula ( [ eq : accurate_sol ] ) or ( [ eq : sphere_sol ] ) .",
    "the flux of electrons at a distance of 300pc is two orders of magnitude larger than at 500pc .",
    "we separately calculated the contributions to the electron energy spectrum from nearby and distant sources .",
    "we selected snrs in the neighborhood of the solar system located within a distance of 1kpc and an electron release time within @xmath9yr in the past .",
    "the boundary condition in this domain almost corresponds to the diffusion path length and life time of electrons around 1  tev .",

    ", we also plotted the flux of low energy interstellar electrons estimated from the galactic radio data @xcite .",
    "cosmic - ray electrons have been observed by a variety of instruments , but only emulsion chamber data provide observations of electrons above 1 tev . since the flux of tev electrons is low , detectors must have large acceptance @xmath131 and high proton rejection power ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the emulsion chamber satisfies these requirements @xcite .",
    "our propagation model , which consists of separately calculated distant and nearby components , is consistent with the observed data for the local primary electron spectrum in the energy range from 10gev to 2tev .",
    "our model also predicts that nearby snrs insert unique , identifiable structures in the electron spectrum from 1tev to 10tev .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : elespec ] , the absolute flux and spectral shape change with the diffusion coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum energy of each snr is the same , independent of the diffusion coefficient value , because it is determined by the age of the snr .",
    "we also calculated how the source spectral shape and release time of electrons from the remnant affect the cosmic - ray electron spectrum .",

    "figure [ fig : elespec_cutoff ] shows the calculated energy spectra with a cut - off of @xmath13310  tev , 20  tev , and @xmath78 in the injected electron spectrum , assuming the prompt release after the explosion .",
    "we can find that these spectra are similar with each other , independent of the cut - off energies .",
    "figure [ fig : elespec_tau ] shows the calculated energy spectra with a cut - off of @xmath134tev , in which electrons are released burst - likely after the explosion in the release time of @xmath135yr , @xmath136yr , @xmath137yr , and @xmath21yr , respectively . as shown in this figure , it is to be noted that the spectrum for @xmath138yr is almost the same with that of the prompt release after the explosion . however , the delay of the release time from snrs have a large impact on the flux in the tev region for @xmath139yr .",
    "we also checked the case of the continuous release .",
    "figure [ fig : elespec_cont ] shows that these spectra are well represented by that of the burst - like release with a mean value of the continuous release time .",
    "we calculated the energy spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons , separating the contributions of sources nearby in space and time ( those within distances of 1kpc and times of @xmath21yr ) and galactic sources located outside this domain .",
    "there are only 9 snrs within a distance of 1kpc and an age of @xmath140yr , as shown in table [ tab : nearbysnrs ] , which is much smaller than the expected number of @xmath141 assuming a supernova rate of 1/30yr and a galactic disk radius of 15kpc .",
    "this is due to selection biases in radio observations , since surface brightnesses in radio observations decrease with age .",
    "thus , also coupled with the reason of the arguments in appendix b , we define a domain of @xmath1421kpc and @xmath143yr to evaluate the electron flux from nearby sources",
    ". there are 7 known snrs within this region listed in table [ tab : nearbysnrs ] : vela , cygnus loop , monogem , g65.3 + 5.7 , hb 21 , s147 , and sn185 . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected number of snrs in this smaller domain is @xmath144",
    ". the difference could be partly due to statistical fluctuations in the small number of sources , and it could also be due to undetected snrs in this domain .",
    "in fact , the surface brightness estimated from an age of @xmath145yr , assuming adiabatic phase , is still fainter than the typical detection limit of surface brightness in studies of the distribution of galactic snrs @xcite .",
    "although this indicates that the electron flux calculated from known nearby snrs may give a lower limit of the flux , the contribution of undetected snrs is expected to be relatively small in the case of the prompt release of electrons after the explosion . since these undetected snrs should have lower surface brightness and be older than detected snrs",
    ", they could scarcely contribute to the electron intensity in the tev region as indicated in figure [ fig : age_distance ] .",
    "some quantitative arguments on this point are discussed in appendix b.    our model predicts that nearby snrs such as the vela , cygnus loop , or monogem , present unique , identifiable structures in the electron spectrum from 1tev to 10tev . as the diffusion coefficient increases ,",
    "electrons propagate larger distances with longer mean path length , resulting the electron density becomes smaller .",
    "this causes a flatter spectral shape and smaller peak flux , as shown in figures [ fig : elespec ] .",
    "the release time @xmath20 after the explosion determines which snrs contribute for cosmic - ray electrons in the tev region . for @xmath126 and @xmath135yr ,",
    "the energy spectra are similar with each other , and the vela snr is the most dominant source in the tev region . for @xmath146yr and @xmath147yr ,",
    "the cygnus loop and the monogem snr are dominant , and for @xmath148yr there are no dominant known sources in the tev region .",
    "we can see that some combinations of parameters ( e.g. @xmath149 @xmath11s@xmath7 , @xmath97 , and @xmath150 ) are already ruled out even by the limited existing data .    besides such primary electrons accelerated in snrs ,",
    "the observed cosmic - ray electron flux includes secondary electrons , produced mainly by interactions of cosmic - ray protons and nuclei with interstellar gas .",
    "the secondaries are mostly decay products of charged pions produced in interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath151 . as positrons are produced by this process",
    ", we can estimate the intensity of secondaries relative to primaries to be @xmath2% at 10 gev from the observed ratio of @xmath152 to @xmath153 @xmath154% at 10 gev @xcite .",
    "the spectral index @xmath155 for secondaries is the same as the index of the parent cosmic - ray protons and nuclei .",
    "this index is larger than that of primary electrons at the source , which is @xmath02.4 in the tev region . since the intensity relative to primary electrons decreases with increasing energy as @xmath156 , the relative intensity of secondaries becomes @xmath02.5% at 1 tev",
    "this suggests that the intensity of the secondary electrons is negligible compared to primary electrons in the energy range of interest here .",
    "next , we estimate the degree of anisotropies from the specific sources in tev region .",
    "let @xmath157 be the contribution to the local density of cosmic - ray electrons at energy @xmath24 from a source located at distance @xmath158 and of age @xmath159 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath160 due to the density gradient of electrons is given by @xmath161 for an individual source , where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the maximum and minimum electron intensity in all directions @xcite .",
    "for example , the anisotropy of electrons for vela with @xmath126 is estimated to be 13% , where @xmath164pc and @xmath165yr .",
    "the anisotropy becomes larger if we include the effect of the delay of the release time from snrs .    in this paper",
    ", it is demonstrated that measurements of the energy spectrum of electrons in the tev region are crucial to detect the unique effects of nearby sources as described above .",
    "if we observe pronounced features in the shape of the spectrum , together with anisotropy towards the nearby snrs , we would confirm the nearby snrs as the main contributors to electrons in the tev region .",
    "we can also perform a more detailed analysis for the release time of electrons , cut - off energy , output energy , diffusion coefficient , and so on .",
    "high energy cosmic - ray electrons are the most powerful probe to help us identify the origin of cosmic rays .",
    "however , at present , only emulsion chamber data are available in the energy region @xmath166tev . to make significant additional observations on electrons in this region , not only balloon flight experiments with long exposures but also new experimental programs such as the calet ( calorimetric electron telescope ) on the international space station @xcite are to be promising to observe the electron spectrum and anisotropy in tev region with high statistical accuracy .",
    "such direct observations will reveal the origin of cosmic - ray electrons in this energy region , and also bring us important information on the sources , acceleration , and propagation of cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "we are grateful to prof .",
    "r.j.wilkes for his careful reading and useful comments of the manuscript .",
    "in section [ subsec : dist_comp ] , we gave the solution ( [ eq : cyl_sol ] ) of the two dimensional diffusion equation for a source of a power - law electron spectrum with boundaries defined by parallel planes .",
    "however , since it has the form of a series , it is tedious for numerical evaluation and hard to understand the physical meaning of each term .",
    "we show that we can simplify the situation at high energies by substituting a three dimensional solution without boundaries for the two dimensional solution with boundaries . in this appendix , to see a general behavior of the solution , we treat a source of a power - law spectrum without an exponential cut - off .",
    "the arguments are valid for @xmath82 , that is @xmath167tev for @xmath168tev .",
    "electrons propagate an average distance of @xmath169 during their lifetime of @xmath50 .",
    "if the propagation distance is smaller than the galactic halo thickness @xmath63 , a three dimensional solution without boundaries is applicable . assuming that a source is located on the plane of the galactic disk , the solution of the diffusion equation ( [ eq : diffusion_eq ] ) is given by @xmath170 where @xmath89 here , assuming that the diffusion coefficient has the form @xmath171 and a source spectrum of the form @xmath172 , we have ( e.g. @xcite and other references therein ) @xmath173 where @xmath174    integrating the solution @xmath175 ( [ eq : sph_sol ] ) on @xmath61 from 0 to @xmath78 and on @xmath70 from 0 to @xmath81 , the electron flux @xmath176 ( from sources assumed to be continuously and uniformly distributed in the galactic disk ) is given by @xmath177 ,    \\label{eq : sol_j3}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the beta function .",

    "the differences between @xmath176 and @xmath178 become smaller .",
    "for the case where halo thickness @xmath125kpc , it is shown that the two solutions above 10gev region agree with each other within an error of 1% .",
    "we define the total flux of electrons as @xmath180 , the flux from distant source at large distances or relatively old ages as @xmath92 , and the flux from nearby sources as @xmath93 .    to avoid statistical fluctuations in the flux due to the small number of nearby sources ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath92 as shown in section [ subsec : dist_comp ] in the following , @xmath91 where @xmath181 is formula ( [ eq : jlocal ] ) defined in section[subsec : dist_comp ] .",
    "then , we have @xmath182 the integrations are carried out in the domain 1 and 2 , where domain 1 is @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and domain 2 is @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we discuss how to find the appropriate values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 for separation of distant and nearby source components .",
    "taking the three dimensional solution of the formula ( [ eq : sph_sol ] ) , the total flux @xmath180 is given by the formula ( [ eq : sol_j3 ] ) as @xmath187 ,   \\label{eq : sol_j3app}\\ ] ] in the case of a power - law source spectrum , where @xmath27 is the beta function .",
