    "to cite an authoritative source , _ the treatment of bose - einstein and fermi - dirac perfect gases can be made in an extremely simple manner_@xcite .",
    "the topic has been known since the discovery of quantum statistics@xcite .",
    "one might think that from a theoretical perspective there is absolutely nothing new to discover about it .",
    "nonetheless , in this paper we report some rather amusing behavior found when investigating how the virial expansion and other properties depend on dimensionality @xmath0 of the system . here",
    ", @xmath0 is an effective dimension given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dimension of physical space and @xmath6 is the power of wave number entering the dispersion relation of the excitations in question ( see below ) . for nonrelativistic massive particles",
    ", we have @xmath7 . for massless fermions ( a reasonable description of neutrinos and electrons in topological insulators ) , we have @xmath8 , and for the asymptotic low - energy spectrum of electrons in graphene , we have @xmath9 . moreover bose - einstein condensates with effective spatial dimensions @xmath5 ranging from 0 to 3 are now routinely made .",
    "such systems are of considerable current interest .",
    "while interactions obviously play a role to varying degrees in the above mentioned systems , this has nevertheless motivated us to revisit the behavior of ideal quantum gases as a function of dimensionality with an emphasis on the analytical structure of the equations of state and other thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the analytical structure reveals itself as surprisingly intricate and complex as dimension is varied .    for any dimension @xmath0 the equation of state of an ideal quantum gas",
    "has a nonzero radius of convergence at @xmath10 .",
    "it can therefore be analytically continued to a complete riemann surface with much ( @xmath0-dependent ) mathematically interesting structure .",
    "we have investigated how and where singularities occur on this riemann surface , how they change character and position with changing @xmath0 , and how that governs the asymptotic behavior of virial coefficients .",
    "we have even found cases where the analytically continued equation of state reappears in a new form , meaningful from the requirements that both density @xmath11 and pressure @xmath12 are real for physical values of the chemical potential @xmath13 ( but usually pathological with regard to more detailed physical behavior ) . to our knowledge this has not previously been reported in the literature.@xcite    an ideal bose gas undergoes a condensation in which the zero - momentum ground state becomes macroscopically occupied above a critical density ( or theoretically equivalent below a critical temperature ) provided the dimensionality @xmath14 . this is a phenomenon accompanied by true non - analyticities in thermodynamic potentials ( however without the appearance of collective modes ) .",
    "one would then expect on general grounds that any expansion of physical quantities ( e.g. pressure ) in powers of density would have a convergence radius given by the critical density or smaller .",
    "on the other hand , it has been known for a long time that the virial expansion of an ideal non - relativistic bose gas in @xmath2 dimensions possesses the peculiar and somewhat surprising property of having a convergence radius @xmath15 which is much larger than the critical density for bose  einstein condensation , @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , and @xmath18 is the riemann zeta function ) .",
    "this was first demonstrated by fuchs@xcite , following a conjecture by widom@xcite .",
    "jensen and hemmer@xcite ( see also ziff and kincaid@xcite ) estimated that @xmath19 , based on numerical evaluation of the first 116 virial coefficients .",
    "the computation is by no means a trivial one  the @xmath20th virial coefficient has a magnitude of order @xmath21 , the remainder of cancellations between terms of order 1 .",
    "a reliable evaluation of the 116th coefficient required computations to be carried out to 160 digits accuracy  a quite formidable task in 1971 . in the above works ,",
    "the reason for the existence of such a surprisingly large convergence radius was not discussed .    in @xmath22 dimensions the situation is the opposite",
    ", @xmath23 is infinite while @xmath24 ( as can be seen from the repeatedly discovered exact virial expansion in two dimensions@xcite ) .",
    "this led us to investigate the dependence on dimensionality in more detail .",
    "this had previously been done by ziff and kincaid@xcite ( they focused on integer dimensions only , but some of their results are valid for arbitrary dimensions ) .",
    "actually , our parameter @xmath0 need not correspond to the physical dimension of the system  what matters is that the density of states per energy interval scales like @xmath25 and that it is possible to define pressure and density as position independent quantities . for excitations with dispersion relation @xmath26 in @xmath5 physical dimensions",
    "we find @xmath27 . only for a standard nonrelativistic spectrum will @xmath0 correspond to the physical dimension .",
    "with excitations living on a fractal subset of physical space we may also obtain a non - integer @xmath0 .",
    "although there may be many interesting physical realizations , the purpose of varying @xmath0 continuously in this paper is mainly to obtain a more coherent and connected picture of the behavior of the virial expansion as dimensionality is varied .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ virial ]",
    "we first discuss a peculiar symmetry between fermions and bosons which occur in the case of ideal quantum gases , its origin , and how it extends to interacting systems .",
    "next we discuss some general aspects of the virial expansion , and display the first few term of the ideal bose gas expansion for general dimension @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ numericalexperiments ] describes our numerical exploration of the virial coefficients @xmath28 as function of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "each @xmath28 has a number of zeros .",
    "they reveal intriguing patterns which inspired many conjectures ( and eventually this whole research ) .",
    "in section  [ specialcases ] we consider the special cases of @xmath29 ( quantum dot ) , @xmath22 ( confined layer ) , and @xmath2 . apart from their physical applications ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are interesting since in those cases the relation between fugacity @xmath31 and density @xmath11 can be inverted exactly .",
    "hence , they allow for a more explicit and detailed analysis , and provide boundary conditions which must be obeyed by the general expansions .",
    "the physically most important system , @xmath2 , is peculiar in that the equation of state ( i.e. , pressure @xmath12 as function of @xmath11 ) extends analytically beyond the density @xmath32 for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "this analytic behavior also holds for other thermodynamic quantities like the chemical potential ( the density fluctuations exhibit a pole singularity at @xmath32 ) .",
    "the behavior for @xmath33 is easily seen to be unphysical , and is not related to the correct behavior of the condensed state .",
    "section  [ riemannsurface ] is a mathematical discussion of how the parametric representation  ( [ implicitequationofstate ] ) can be extended to the riemann surface of the polylogarithmic functions involved , leading to the general parametric representation  ( [ generaleos ] ) .",
    "the sheets of the complete riemann surface are labeled by an infinite - dimensional vector @xmath34 of integers . on an infinite subset of these sheets the parametric representation  ( [ generaleos ] )",
    "provide a candidate equation of state , related to the usual ( low - density ) bose equation of state by analytic continuation .",
    "section  [ travelaccount ] is a first account of our travel on the riemann surface of the equation of state , first locating the singularities governing the radius of convergence of the virial expansion for @xmath2 , and next exploring how these singularities move as @xmath0 is changed .    in section  [ asymptoticcoefficients ]",
    "we demonstrate how knowledge of the closest singularities of @xmath35 , and the behavior of @xmath35 around these , can be used to provide an accurate analytical representation of the asymptotic behavior of the virial coefficients .",
    "the analytic prediction compares very well with numerically calculated coefficients .    in section  [ nearbec ]",
    "the behavior near the bose - einstein condensation point is analysed , revealing why the singularity in the equation of state vanishes at this point for dimensions @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 ) .",
    "section  [ exploringdimension ] is a second account of our exploration of the riemann surface , with focus on how singularities of the equation of state flow when @xmath0 is changed , and in particular the behavior of this flow as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the singularities are in general of square root type . however , for @xmath22 the singularities are logarithmic ; hence each of them must be formed by an infinite number of coalescing square root singularities as @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , ( infinitely ) many pairs of square root singularities flow towards @xmath10 as @xmath41 , where none can be seen in the explicit equation of state .",
    "the annhilation mechanism seems to be similar to the one which is operative in the disappearance of two square root singularities in @xmath42 when @xmath43 .",
    "we close the paper with a few remarks in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "consider a @xmath0-dimensional volume @xmath44 filled with identical nonrelativistic , noninteracting mass-@xmath45 quantum mechanical particles . without internal degrees of freedom , the number of single - particle states in a tiny interval @xmath46 around @xmath47 is @xmath48 when @xmath49 ( otherwise zero ) . here , the surface of a unit sphere in @xmath0 dimensions is set to @xmath50 in general , and we have assumed that @xmath51 in a regular manner . at a given temperature @xmath52 we choose to measure energy in units of @xmath53 , and length in units of the thermal wavelength @xmath54 . for bosons in the grand canonical ensemble the equation of state",

    "the expressions for fermions are the same with the replacements @xmath57 it is intriguing that the _ same _ functions describe both bosons and fermions , only in different parameter ranges .",
    "however , the generalization of equation  ( [ bosefermisymmetry ] ) to interacting systems is less direct . in a functional integral formalism ,",
    "the fugacity relation between bosons and fermions is related to the rule that for bosons one should integrate over classical fields @xmath58 which are periodic in the imaginary time ( @xmath59 ) direction , and for fermions over grassmann fields @xmath60 which are antiperiodic .",
    "this difference can be eliminated by a @xmath59-dependent gauge transformation at the cost of transforming @xmath61 , equivalent to @xmath62 . without interactions",
    "the relation between pressures @xmath12 is a consequence of the relation between classical and grassmann gaussian integrals , @xmath63 which in the interacting case generalizes to the diagrammatic rule of one extra minus - sign per fermion loop .",
    "i.e. , if we for a model with interactions know the complete loop expansion of the bosonic functional integral , with @xmath64 being the @xmath65-loop contribution , then relation ( [ bosefermisymmetry ] ) generalized to @xmath66 where @xmath67 for bosons and @xmath68 for fermions .    in the following , we return to the noninteracting model and we will mainly consider bosons in explicit expressions .",

    "the fermion cofficients are related to the bosonic ones by @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the bosons and fermions have the same radius of convergence for their virial expansions , governed by singularities which are related by inversion , @xmath73 . due to reality conditions",
    "both cases also have reflection symmetry under @xmath74 .",
    "thus , singularities outside the real axis will occur in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the virial coefficients can be calculated by order - by - order inversion of the mayer series  ( [ mayerexpansion ] ) .",
    "they can also be found through an explicit algorithm@xcite .",
    "for the latter , define the power series @xmath75 and coefficients @xmath76 through the generating function @xmath77 an alternative way to describe @xmath76 is as follows : define @xmath78 .",

    "fermion coefficients are obtained by @xmath72 .",
    "the virial coefficients  ( [ explicitcoefficients ] ) exhibit much structure when analysed as function of dimensionality . they reveal an interesting pattern of zeros .",
    "the most prominent feature is that one zero @xmath94 rapidly approaches @xmath2 as @xmath20 increases , and another @xmath95 rapidly approaches @xmath96 .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "the convergence turns out to be exponential in @xmath20 , with some oscillations in the prefactor . clearly , it is the presence of the zeros close to @xmath2 which causes the virial expansion to have an unusually large radius of convergence at @xmath2 .",
    "more generally , the set of zeros form an intriguing pattern at low @xmath20 . investigating",
    "this order by order is an amusing numerical experiment , providing many opportunities to make ( wrong ) conjectures .",
    "when extending this experiment up to @xmath99 , we found the most prominent features to be that i ) at @xmath22 all even virial coefficients beyond the second vanish , @xmath100 for @xmath101 , and ii ) there are several special dimensions @xmath102 which act as `` attractors '' for zeros , with the consequence that the virial expansion has an exceptionally large convergence radius , @xmath103 , for such dimensions .",

    "there are additional zeros in the region @xmath106 . ]",
    "we soon discovered that the special dimensions followed the pattern @xmath107 leading to the conjecture that this is true for all @xmath45 .",
    "the correct result , which is difficult to discover by numerical experiments alone , is that equation  ( [ conjecture ] ) holds only for @xmath108 .",

    "the boson equation of state in its unphysical third quadrant ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) actually describes the fermion equation of state in its physical region , obtained by inversion about the origin as shown .",
    "this is a general feature of noninteracting systems in any dimension . ]    for @xmath29 we find @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "i.e. @xmath115 with virial coefficients @xmath116 and radius of convergence @xmath117 due to the logarithmic singularity at @xmath118 .",
    "this singularity has no natural physical interpretation for bosons .",

    "the equation of state for ideal quantum gases in two dimensions .",
    "the boson and fermion equations of state only differ in their second virial coefficient .",
    "two space dimensions allow for intermediate ( anyon ) statistics which interpolates between the bosons and fermions .",
    "the equation of state for such hypothetical particles is not exactly known , and probably very far from a smooth interpolation at high densities ( equivalent to low temperatures ) . ]    for @xmath22 , we find @xmath119 and can infer the differential equation @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "the solution is @xmath122 note that @xmath123 , as can be verified by direct manipulation of the integral .",
    "thus , the equation of state for fermions and bosons only differ in the second virial coefficient , @xmath124 .",
    "this can also be seen from the explicit virial coefficients , @xmath125 where @xmath126 are the bernoulli numbers .",
    "since @xmath127 for all odd @xmath128 the virial coefficients @xmath129 for all even @xmath130 ( recall that all odd coefficients are equal for bosons and fermions ) .",
    "the property that only the second virial coefficient depends on statistics seems to generalize to haldane exclusion statistics@xcite ( interpolating between bosons and fermions ) in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "the requirements , beyond interpretation of exclusion statistics , are that i ) the density of states is constant as function of energy , and ii ) a position - independent pressure and density can be defined .",
    "the latter condition is not fulfilled by the hamiltonian model considered in ref .   , see ref .   , but this does not affect their computation of virial coefficients .    due to pole singularities in the integrand at @xmath131 ( with integer @xmath132 ) the function @xmath35 has logarithmic singularities at the same points .",
    "hence , the virial expansion has a radius of convergence , @xmath133 .",
    "we know of no physical reasons for the occurence of these singularities ( contrary to the @xmath29 case , where the singularity has a physical origin in the fermion system ) .",
    "for later analysis , recall that a logarithmic singularity has infinitely many riemann sheets . in this case , when @xmath11 encircles the singularity at @xmath134 once in the clockwise direction the function changes by @xmath135 .",
    "the result of repeated encirclings is that @xmath136 when the singularity at @xmath137 is encircled @xmath138 times in total , counted in the clockwise direction .",
    "the order in which the encirclings occur does not matter .",
    "hence , in the two - dimensional ( @xmath22 ) case , each riemann sheet is uniquely labeled by a single integer @xmath139 .",
    "the total surface is multiply connected , so there are infinitely many topologically inequivalent ways of moving from one sheet to another .",
    "amusingly , the _ same _ mayer expansion ( [ mayerexpansion ] ) ( for @xmath22 ) defines an infinity of possible equations of state , depending on which riemann sheet is selected .",
    "all these equations of state are physical in the sense that the pressure is real when the density is real .",
    "as will be seen in section [ riemannsurface ] this behavior extends to all dimensions @xmath0 , with the generalization that each riemann sheet is labeled by an infinite - dimensional vector @xmath34 of integers , which generically must be restricted by the condition @xmath140 for the pressure to be real when the density is real .       the equation of state for ideal quantum gases in three dimensions",
    ". the pressure as a function of density can be analytically continued beyond the critical density for bose - einstein condensation , @xmath141 . the same is true for other thermodynamic quantities , like the chemical potential @xmath142 .",
    "however , the behavior for @xmath33 is unphysical ( with @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) , and does not correspond to the correct infinite volume limit of the system . ]    in three dimensions , it seems impossible to invert the mayer expansion  ( [ mayerexpansion ] ) explicitly .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath145 numerically to high accuracy and quite large @xmath20 .",
    "they behave like @xmath146 when @xmath20 becomes large . here",
    "@xmath147 changes quite slowly and smoothly ( i.e.  algebraically ) with @xmath20 , and @xmath148 , @xmath149 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ eos_d3 ] an equation of state can be computed from this virial expansion far beyond the bose - einstein condensation point @xmath150 . however , the solid curve is unphysical for @xmath33 , since pressure decreases with increasing density .    in general ,",
    "the virial coefficients can be expressed by a contour integral @xmath151 for evaluation at large @xmath20 one should deform the closed curve @xmath152 as far away from the origin as possible , since the behavior of @xmath28 then is governed by the contributions from the nearest singularities of @xmath35 , beyond which @xmath152 can not be deformed . with a pair of complex conjugate singularities , at @xmath153 and @xmath154 , one obtains an asymptotic behavior @xmath155 up to algebraic corrections in @xmath20 .",
    "the phase @xmath156 is not important for locating the singularities . by comparing this result with the numerical observations ,",
    "one concludes that the convergence of the @xmath2 virial expansion is governed by a complex conjugate pair of singularities at @xmath157 .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier findings that the radius of convergence is much larger than the critical density for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "we want to study these singularities in more detail .",
    "there are two possible sources of singularites in an implicitly represented function @xmath158 , namely i ) singularities which are explicit in the parametric representation of @xmath159 or @xmath160 , or both ( in which case they may sometimes compensate each other ) , and ii ) singularities occurring where @xmath161 is analytic , but can not be inverted to an analytic function @xmath162 because @xmath163 .",
    "the singularities of relevance to our case are of the second kind . to find their accurate positions in the @xmath11-plane , and the corresponding @xmath31-plane values",
    ", one must extend the parametric representation ( [ implicitequationofstate ] ) to the full riemann surface of the functions involved .",
    "the expressions involved are known as polylogarithmic functions , @xmath164 the sum converges for @xmath165 and has an analytic extension equal to the integral expression in the whole @xmath31-plane cut along the real @xmath31-axis from 1 to @xmath166 .",
    "this is the primary riemann sheet of the polylogarithm .",
    "moving @xmath31 along a closed path which winds once clockwise around @xmath167 ( not encircling @xmath168 ) changes the integral so that @xmath169 where the right hand side again is defined on the primary riemann sheet .",
    "the new term arises because moving @xmath31 across the positive real @xmath47-axis drags the integration path with it .",
    "this can be undone by explicitly evaluating the pole contribution which makes up the difference .",
    "the new term must be handled carefully , since @xmath170 is multivalued around @xmath168 and @xmath171 is multivalued around @xmath167 .",
    "we introduce @xmath172 as a new variable , in terms of which the singularity at @xmath167 becomes the image of infinitely many singularities in the @xmath13-plane , at @xmath134 , @xmath173 .",
    "we define the primary riemann sheet by introducing cuts @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "if we start on the primary sheet and make @xmath176 crossings ( counted in the clockwise direction ) of the cut from @xmath134 to @xmath166 , and no crossings of any other cuts , the polylogarithm will change as @xmath177 this is found most safely from the expression@xcite , @xmath178 which is convergent in a finite region around @xmath179 .",
    "it can also be seen directly , in that each new crossing adds a new function , but also changes the phase of the previously emerged ones .",
    "hence , the total contribution from @xmath176 crossings is @xmath180 by paying close attention to phase relations on the primary sheet one finds @xmath181 . by further using the formula @xmath182",
    "one finds agreement with equation  ( [ continuedfunction ] ) . this equation is also valid if @xmath176 is negative , that is if one makes crossings in the anticlockwise direction .",
    "the contributions from crossing different branch cuts are additive and do not interfere with each other .",
    "thus , it does not matter in which order the various crossings have occurred , only their total number .",
    "this is a great simplification .",
    "thus , we may label the riemann sheets by an integer - valued vector @xmath34 , where @xmath138 is the net number of times the branch cut from @xmath134 to @xmath166 has been crossed in the clockwise direction ( starting from the primary sheet ) , and define a polylogarithm extended to the complete riemann surface as @xmath183 where @xmath184 when starting from the primary sheet , in practice only a few ( if any ) of the coefficients @xmath138 will be nonzero .",
