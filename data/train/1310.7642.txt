    "a good fit was obtained ( reduced @xmath113 ; @xmath114 compared to the model with variable @xmath14 ) with @xmath20 ( 90% c.l . ) , indicating that , indeed , the average reflection strength seems to be large ( the values of @xmath68 and @xmath13 obtained in this fit are @xmath115 and @xmath116  kev ) .",
    "this value of @xmath19 is consistent with earlier measurements ( e.g. , @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recently presented the stacked spectrum of a complete sample of 95 _ swift_-bat - selected local agns in the northern galactic cap .",
    "as the individual spectra were not corrected for absorption , the resulting sum had the characteristic @xmath6@xmath7  kev @xmath117 power - law of the xrb spectrum .",
    "if the average @xmath1 agn spectrum of fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] is accurate , then summing this spectrum over the @xcite lf [ while including the @xcite @xmath59 distribution and the @xmath47@xmath52 relation ( fig .",

    "swift_-bat  sources showing a more pronounced hard x - ray hump .",
    "the reason for this is found by examining the dotted and dashed lines which plot the contributions from unobscured ( @xmath120 ) and compton - thin obscured sources ( i.e. , @xmath121 ) . here",
    ", one can see that the stacked compton - thin agns show a stronger reflection hump than predicted while the unobscured agns present a slightly weaker hump , however , the measured @xmath19 values agree with the model one within the errors @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the contributions from obscured and unobscured agns agree very well ( these lines were not individually adjusted  all three black curves were moved by the same factor to normalize the total ) indicating that the northern galactic cap sources well sample the @xcite @xmath59 distribution . all in all , the agreement of the two spectral shapes seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vas ] supports the accuracy of our derived spectrum and the effectiveness of the lf - fitting procedure .",
    "the value of @xmath68 measured here is consistent with the typical value of @xmath122 used by xrb models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the derived @xmath13 is also close to the values ( @xmath3@xmath123  kev ) used in xrb synthesis models .",
    "in contrast , there is more variation on the assumption made for the reflection strength : @xcite and @xcite assume @xmath124 and @xmath75 , but with the reflection strength dropping off with luminosity ; alternatively , @xcite use @xmath125 and @xmath126 at all @xmath52 .",
    "this last spectrum has a strong reflection hump and is most similar to the average spectrum measured here .",
    "when fitting the xrb spectrum , one must also deal with uncertainties in the evolution of the x - ray lf @xcite , the compton - thick fraction ( and its possible evolution ; @xcite ) , and the absorption distribution .",
    "these factors , combined with the degeneracies involved in fitting the spectrum @xcite , means the xrb spectrum can still be fit with an average spectral shape within the measured uncertainties we derived for @xmath68 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .      as indicated above , the best multi - band fit to the lfs resulted in a @xmath6@xmath7  kev lf that is not a good representation of the ones measured by _",

    "[ fig:2to10lf ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      our procedure also provided interesting constraints on the distant reflector .",
    "first , the fits preferred that the reflection strength remain constant as a function of agn luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; that is , the presence of a x - ray baldwin effect was not required .",
    "the strength of any x - ray baldwin effect has been the source of debate for several years , as it requires precise observations over a wide range of luminosities and being able to control for variability .",
    "if present , it might be connected to the obscuring material around the agn , as @xcite recently showed that the observed decrease in @xmath47 with luminosity could give rise to a baldwin effect of the right slope .",
    "the fact that no baldwin effect is preferred in the lf fits would indicate that the distant reflector is not associated with the obscuring material , but arises from another source that is common to agns of all luminosity , such as the outer regions of the accretion disk or broad - line region clouds @xcite .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that the distant reflector is associated with the mid - infrared ( 12  @xmath22 m ) emitter that appears to be independent of the x - ray luminosity and agn classification @xcite .",
    "its is also important to remember that both the evidence for and against the x - ray baldwin effect is concentrated at @xmath6@xmath7  kev luminosities @xmath133  erg  s@xmath35 ; it is still unknown precisely how the reflection strength behaves at larger luminosities .",
    "the average spectrum derived in sect .  [ sect : res ] strongly indicates that the distant reflector has a sub - solar fe abundance .",
    "again , the reason the fit was driven to this result was to simultaneously satisfy the constraints of strong reflection and a fe  k@xmath15  ew of 70  ev .",
    "indeed , the best fitting spectral model that used the @xmath19 parameter ( and found @xmath134 ) predicts a narrow fe  k@xmath15  ew of 216  ev , much larger than the typical observed values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a sub - solar fe abundance in the nuclear environment of agn host galaxies is problematic , as there is a wealth of evidence that metallicity increases to super - solar abundances in the agn environment ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it is highly unlikely that the abundance @xmath135 found by this procedure is pointing to the true iron abundance . changing the abundance set to the @xcite measurement that has a smaller iron abundance",
    "does not alter the derived @xmath14 .",
    "part of the problem may be the geometric assumptions built into the ` pexmon ' model , as the compton backscattered and associated line emission are based on an infinitely thick disk geometry .",
    "repeating this experiment with a neutral reflection model that can handle a wider range of geometries ( e.g. , mytorus ; @xcite ) would be able to test this assertion , with the limitation of introducing additional free parameters .",
    "alternatively , the low value of @xmath14 may indicate that the reflecting medium is dusty .",
    "gas - phase iron is heavily depleted onto grains in dusty gas , but the iron in the grains can still produce fe  k@xmath15  emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the ew of the line would depend on the details of the gas - grain mixture as well as geometry , so further investigation of this idea will be the subject of future work .",
    "however , this explanation for the value of @xmath14 would support the association of the distant reflector with the 12  @xmath22 m emitter .",
    "this paper presents a measurement of the properties of the average @xmath136 agn spectrum between @xmath2 and @xmath3  kev by simultaneously fitting the measured agn lfs in the @xmath2@xmath6  kev , @xmath6@xmath7  kev , @xmath8@xmath9  kev and @xmath10@xmath11  kev bands .",

    "<S> the broadband x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) contains information about the nuclear environment from schwarzschild radii scales ( where the primary power - law is generated in a corona ) to distances of @xmath0  pc ( where the distant reflector may be located ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the average shape of the x - ray spectrum is an important input into x - ray background synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> here , local ( @xmath1 ) agn luminosity functions ( lfs ) in five energy bands are used as a low - resolution , luminosity - dependent x - ray spectrometer in order to constrain the average agn x - ray spectrum between @xmath2 and @xmath3  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4@xmath5  kev lf measured by _ </S>",
    "<S> swift_-bat  is assumed to be the best determination of the local lf , and then a spectral model is varied to determine the best fit to the @xmath2@xmath6  kev , @xmath6@xmath7  kev , @xmath8@xmath9  kev and @xmath10@xmath11  kev lfs . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral model consists of a gaussian distribution of power - laws with a mean photon - index @xmath12 and cutoff energy @xmath13 , as well as contributions from distant and disc reflection . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection strength is parameterised by varying the fe abundance relative to solar , @xmath14 , and requiring a specific fe  k@xmath15  equivalent width ( ew ) . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of the x - ray baldwin effect can be tested . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral model that best fits the four lfs has @xmath16 , @xmath17  kev , @xmath18 ( 90% c.l . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - solar @xmath14 is unlikely to be a true measure of the gas - phase metallicity , but indicates the presence of strong reflection given the assumed fe  k@xmath15  ew . indeed , parameterising the reflection strength with the @xmath19 parameter gives @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> there is moderate evidence for no x - ray baldwin effect . </S>",
    "<S> accretion disc reflection is included in the best fit model , but it is relatively weak ( broad iron k@xmath15 ew @xmath21  ev ) and does not significantly affect any of the conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> a critical result of our procedure is that the shape of the local @xmath6@xmath7  kev lf measured by _ heao-1 _  and _ maxi _  </S>",
    "<S> is incompatible with the lfs measured in the hard x - rays by _ </S>",
    "<S> swift_-bat  and _ rxte_. we therefore present a new determination of the local @xmath6@xmath7  kev lf that is consistent with all other energy bands , as well as the de - evolved @xmath6@xmath7  kev lf estimated from the _ xmm - newton _  hard bright survey . </S>",
    "<S> this new lf should be used to revise current measurements of the evolving agn lf in the @xmath6@xmath7  kev band . finally , the suggested absence of the x - ray baldwin effect points to a possible origin for the distant reflector in dusty gas not associated with the agn obscuring medium </S>",
