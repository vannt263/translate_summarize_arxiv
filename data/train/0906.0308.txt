    "amongst the first physics results of the atlas detector at lhc @xcite will be an analysis of j/@xmath0 and @xmath1 production . even at low luminosity atlas",
    "will quickly start improving on current quarkonia measurements providing world leading results with around 10  pb@xmath2 of data .",
    "the narrow quarkonia resonances will also be used as tools for alignment and calibration of the trigger and tracking systems .",
    "the narrow quarkonia resonances will be used to gain understanding of first physics performance measurements .",
    "trigger validation , performance and efficiency studies will take place , allowing optimisation of trigger parameters such as thresholds and prescale factors .",
    "mass shifts of j/@xmath0 in physics variables can detect effects in different parts of the detector .",
    "preselection cuts ensure that the decay kinematics of the j/@xmath0 are particularly favorable for magnetic field studies since the muons from j/@xmath0 have large boosts and small opening angle , so magnetic field effects are not smeared out",
    ". di - muons from @xmath1 have large opening angles which allows more accurate vertexing , useful for alignment studies .    both muons from the j/@xmath0 have generally low @xmath3 . these complement the muon samples from z decays which have @xmath3 above @xmath4 .",
    "we expect 1  pb@xmath2 ( @xmath51 day ) muon stream early atlas data , to yield around 17,000 j/@xmath0 and 20,000 @xmath1(1s ) before trigger . in comparison",
    "we only expect 400 z @xmath6 events with 1  pb@xmath2 .",
    "cdf and @xmath7 extensively and successfully used quarkonia mass shifts to disentangle various detector effects but it took many years at the tevatron to collect sufficient statistics across a range of variables to allow for proper correction and alignment leading to a detailed understanding of various detector effects .",
    "the dimuon mass resolutions at atlas are expected to be approximately @xmath8 ( j/@xmath0 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the main expected sources of background are indirect j/@xmath0 from b - decays , the continuum of muons from heavy flavour decays , drell - yan and decays in flight of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "figure  @xmath12 shows the reconstructed invariant mass distribution in the j/@xmath0 and @xmath1 region for the di - muon dataset for an integrated luminosity of about 10  pb@xmath2 .",
    "the background is suppressed with vertexing and impact parameter cuts on the muons and a pseudo - proper time cut on the reconstructed quarkonium candidate .",
    "the radial displacement , @xmath13 , of the two - track vertex from the beamline is used to distinguish between prompt and non - prompt j/@xmath0 .",
    "pseudo - proper time @xmath14 is defined by :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the j/@xmath0 invariant mass and transverse momentum , @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath13 is the measured transverse decay length ( the displacement in the transverse @xmath19 plane traversed by the j/@xmath0 from the primary vertex ) .",
    "prompt j/@xmath0 have a zero pseudo - proper time whereas non - prompt j/@xmath0 primarily come from b - hadron decays with an exponentially decaying pseudo - proper time distribution due to the lifetime of the parent b - hadrons . the distribution shown in figure",
    "@xmath20a is very powerful since a simultaneous fit gives access to a number of important measurements , such as the detector resolution in @xmath14 , relative yields of prompt and non - prompt j/@xmath0 , and effective average lifetime of b hadrons .",
    "a pseudo - proper time cut of less than @xmath21 allows one to retain prompt j/@xmath0 with an efficiency of 93% and a purity of 97% as shown in figure  @xmath20b .",
    "an important ongoing activity is the analysis of the effects of various types of deformations on the parameters of quarkonia resonances such as mass and pseudo - proper lifetime .",
    "a key part of this effort is the development of a monitoring tool , capable of demonstrating the success ( or otherwise ) of the alignment procedure .",
    "another ongoing activity is the material mapping of the atlas inner detector .",
    "incorrect accounting of material can cause biases that can be detected as systematic shifts in the measured mean value of the j/@xmath0 mass . in atlas",
    "we have developed a fast and efficient method for electron bremsstrahlung recovery , based on the dynamical adjustment of the  system noise \" term in the kalman covariance matrix , once a bremsstrahlung like behavior has been detected .",
    "this is called dynamic noise adjustment ( dna ) .",
    "the output of the kalman dna fitter , position and intensity of the bremsstrahlung , can be used for material monitoring in the inner detector , since the probability of bremsstrahlung increases with increased material thickness .",
    "different qcd production models predict different spin alignment dependence with @xmath3 . there is little agreement between the models , and indeed between measurements , especially at low @xmath3 .",
    "the decay angle @xmath22 is defined as the angle between positive muon direction in the quarkonium rest frame and quarkonium direction in the lab frame .",
    "distribution of the decay angle depends on polarisation state . without considering spin alignment ,",
    "the decay angle distribution is flat . for j/@xmath0 with fully transverse polarisation , spin alignment is described by @xmath23 , whereas j/@xmath0 with fully longitudinal polarisation , spin alignment is described by @xmath24 .",
    "when the two muons forming a quarkonium state have similar @xmath3 the decay angle @xmath22 tends to be small . as the decay angle opens , one muon tends to have a higher @xmath3 , the other a lower @xmath3 .",
    ", for longitudinally ( dotted lines ) and transversely ( dashed lines ) polarised j/@xmath0 mesons , in slices of j/@xmath0 @xmath3 : left to right , top to bottom @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , above @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite , width=453 ]    in tevatron studies of j/@xmath0 polarisation measurement a dimuon trigger was used , which limited the acceptance to the case where both muons have reasonably high @xmath3 and the decay angle is limited to the range @xmath31 .",
    "atlas proposes to use not only a di - muon trigger , but also a single muon trigger with a 10  gev threshold .",
    "the single 10  gev muon trigger will allow events to be picked up at large decay angle , @xmath22 , combining the triggered muon with a reconstructed track ( @xmath32500  mev ) offline to form a quarkonium candidate with improved acceptance .",
    "areas with geometrical acceptances close to 100@xmath33 , as well as overlap measurements between the single and dimuon samples can be used for cross - normalisation of the two samples .",
    "the di - muon and single muon samples are separately corrected for efficiencies and acceptances .",
    "high @xmath3 data in both samples have 100@xmath33 acceptance which is used for cross - normalisation and combination .",
    "figure  @xmath34 shows distribution of the reconstructed samples , corrected for acceptances and efficiencies , for two extreme polarisation scenarios .",
    "good agreement is achieved with simulated samples .    with an integrated luminosity of just 10  pb@xmath2",
