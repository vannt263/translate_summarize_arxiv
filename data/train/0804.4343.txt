    "when @xmath248 the deflecting potential @xmath23 is amplified even for small @xmath257 ( @xmath277 ) , which is associated with the fact that @xmath278 is greater than 1 even for @xmath279 .",

    "the system enters the non - standard regime ( @xmath282 ) before entering the epoch of an accelerated expansion ( @xmath283 ) , which leads to the amplification of @xmath23 .",
