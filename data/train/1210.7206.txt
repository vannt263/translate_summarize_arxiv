    "statistical qcd ( quantum chromodynamics ) calculations predict that at high temperature and/or energy density , a system of strongly interacting particles , consisting of quarks and gluons , is formed where the particles would interact fairly weakly due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "such a phase consisting of ( almost ) free quarks and gluons is termed as the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "experimentally the qgp can be produced by colliding heavy nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies , thus creating a region of enormous energy density .",
    "understanding the nature of phase transition from normal hadronic matter to qgp has been a topic of tremendous interest over last decades , both in terms of theoretical studies and large scale experiments .",
    "the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory has been the major facility for the search and study of qgp and to explore the qcd phase transition .",
    "theoretical models , based on lattice qcd , reveal that at vanishing @xmath1 , the transition from qgp to hadron gas is a simple crossover  @xcite , whereas at large @xmath1 , the phase transition is of first order  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects the existence of a critical point at the end of the first order transition .",
    "locating the qcd critical point has been one of the major thrusts of the physics program at rhic .",
    "the collider is capable of accelerating and colliding beams from top energy at @xmath0 = 200  gev , down to as low as @xmath0 = 7.7  gev .",
    "taking advantage of this , a beam energy scan program has been undertaken to exploit wide region of phase diagram and to search for the possible location of the qcd critical point  @xcite .",
    "one of the most plausible signatures of the critical point has been predicted to be the large event - by - event fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities measured in high energy heavy ",
    "ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "this is because of the fact that the thermodynamic susceptibilities ( @xmath2 ) and the correlation length ( @xmath3 ) of the system diverge at the critical point  @xcite .",
    "various qcd inspired models predict that higher moments of conserved quantities , such as distributions of net  charge , net  baryon and the net  strangeness are associated with the higher order thermodynamic susceptibilities and exhibit strong dependence on the correlation strength .",
    "this makes the moments , such as , mean ( @xmath4 ) , standard deviation ( @xmath5 ) , skewness ( @xmath6 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath7 ) , etc .",
    ", sensitive probes of the location of the critical point .",
    "these moments are related to the correlation length by @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite . in order to cancel the volume term in the susceptibilities , different combinations of the moments",
    "are constructed , such as , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which can be used to have direct comparison of experimental results to lattice calculations .",
    "thus at the critical point , one would expect large non - monotonic behavior in these products .",
    "recent lattice qcd model estimations  @xcite have proposed the extraction of freeze - out parameters of the collision from the analysis of higher moments of net  charge distribution .    among all conserved quantities ,",
    "experimentally it is advantageous to study net  charge distributions .",
    "the fluctuations of net  charge include effects from net  baryon and net  strangeness .",
    "net - charges take into account all the charged particles produced in the collisions , and thus can be directly compared with theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "analytical calculations  @xcite also suggest that the net ",
    "charge higher moment analysis may be less affected by acceptance effects . to understand various physics processes which contribute to the moments of net  charge distributions ,",
    "three different models have been used , such as , a qcd based model ( hijing  @xcite ) , a transport model ( urqmd  @xcite ) and a thermal model , therminator-2  @xcite .",
    "the results of these event generators are compared to those of the hadron resonance gas ( hrg )  @xcite model predictions .",
    "because of the absence of any critical phenomenon in these models , they set a baseline for the measurements at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) .",
