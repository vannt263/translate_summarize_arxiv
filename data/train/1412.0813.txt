    "in a pair of recent papers the bialas - bzdak model  @xcite ( bb ) of small angle elastic proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) scattering at high energies was studied at 7 tev lhc energy  @xcite . in those papers a terse overview",
    "is reported about the field of elastic scattering at high energies . here",
    "we would like to highlight only some recent works which influenced us .    in this manuscript",
    "the bb model is extrapolated to future lhc energies .",
    "our method to include the energy evolution of the parameters is somewhat similar to the so - called `` geometric scaling '' discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and also in ref .",
    "@xcite .    using 2012 data the totem experiment recently made an important experimental observation at @xmath2  tev : the @xmath0 elastic differential cross - section shows a deviation from the most simple non - exponential behavior at low-@xmath3 ,  @xcite where @xmath4 is the squared four - momentum transfer of the @xmath0 scattering process .",
    "this feature of the @xmath2  tev ( preliminary ) totem dataset , was related to @xmath4-channel unitarity of the forward scattering amplitude ( fsa ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , a concept that we also focus on , using and generalizing in a unitary manner the quark - diquark model of bialas and bzdak for the determination of the shape of the fsa of elastic @xmath0 scattering .    in its original form",
    ", the bb model  @xcite assumes that the real part of the fsa is negligible , correspondingly , the fsa vanishes at the diffractive minima . at the isr energies of @xmath123.5@xmath562.5 gev , that were first analyzed in the inspiring paper of bialas and bzdak  @xcite",
    ", this assumption is indeed reasonable , as confirmed in ref .  @xcite . at these isr energies ,",
    "only very few data points were available in the dip region around the first diffractive minimum of elastic @xmath0 scattering , which were then left out from the bb model fits of ref .",
    "@xcite to achieve a quality description of the remaining data points .",
    "however , in recent years , totem data  @xcite explored the dip region at the lhc energy of 7 tev in great details , at several different values of the squared four - momentum transfer @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated , that the original bb model can not describe this dip region , not without at least a small real part that has to be added to its fsa in a reasonable way .",
    "subsequently , the bb model has been generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite by allowing for a perturbatively small real part of the fsa , which improved the agreement of the model with totem data on elastic @xmath0 scattering at the lhc energy of @xmath6 tev .",
    "it was expected that the main reason for the appearance of this real part is that certain rare elastic scattering of the constituents of the protons may be non - collinear thus may lead to inelastic events even if the elementary interactions are elastic .",
    "the corresponding phenomenological generalization of the bialas - bzdak model  @xcite was indeed based on the assumption that the real part of the fsa is small , and can be handled perturbatively .",
    "the resulting @xmath7-generalized bialas - bzdak ( @xmath7bb ) model was compared to isr data in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was demonstrated that a small , of the order of 1 % real part of the fsa indeed results in excellent fit qualities and a statistically acceptable description of the data in the region of the diffractive minimum or dip .",
    "however , at the lhc energy of 7 tev , the same @xmath7bb model does not result in a satisfactory , statistically acceptable fit quality , although the visual quality of the fitted curves improve significantly as compared to that of the original bb model  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that at the lhc energies the real part of the fsa may reach significant values where unitarity constraints may already play an important role .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath8-matrix provides also the basis for the optical theorem , which in turn provides a method to determine the total cross - section from an extrapolation of the elastic scattering measurements to the @xmath9 point .    in the @xmath7bb model of ref .",
    "@xcite , unitarity constraints were not explicitly considered : as the original bb model with zero real parts obeyed unitarity , adding a small real part may possibly resulted only in small violations of unitarity and the optical theorem . however , when the model was fitted to the 7 tev totem data in the dip region in ref .",
    "@xcite , the extrapolation to the point of @xmath9 and the related value of the total cross - section underestimated the measured total cross - section by about 40% , suggesting , that perhaps the real part of the fsa may be large , and unitarity relations should be explicitly considered .",
    "these indications motivate the present manuscript , where the bialas - bzdak model is further generalized to arbitrarily large real parts of the fsa , fully taking into account unitarity constraints .",
    "the resulting model is referred to as the real extended bialas - bzdak ( rebb ) model .",
    "the structure of the manuscript is as follows : in section  [ sec : unitarity ] , the general form of the forward scattering amplitude is re - derived for the case of a non - vanishing real part starting from @xmath8-matrix unitarity .",
    "then this result is applied to the extension of the bb model to a non - vanishing and possibly large real part of the fsa .    in section  [ sec : fitdescription ] , the resulting rebb model is fitted to totem data on elastic @xmath0 scattering at @xmath10 7 tev , both in the diffractive cone  @xcite and in the dip region  @xcite , separately .    based on these fits and comparisons of the rebb model to @xmath1 7 tev data , in section",
    "[ sec : shadow_profile ] the shadow profile function a(b ) is evaluated .",
    "this function characterizes the probability of inelastic @xmath0 scattering at a given impact parameter @xmath11 , and is compared to the shadow profile functions of elastic @xmath0 collisions at lower , isr energies .",
    "section [ sec : non_exponential ] is devoted to study the structure of the differential cross - section @xmath12 at low-@xmath3 values and also to compare it with a purely exponential behavior .    in section  [ sec : excitation ]",
    ", the excitation function of the fit parameters is investigated and their evolution with @xmath13 is obtained based on a geometrical picture .",
    "the model parameters are extrapolated to the expected future lhc energies of 8 , 13 , 14 and 15 tev , as well as for 28 tev , that is not foreseen to be available at man - made accelerators in the near future , but may be relevant for the investigation of cosmic ray events .",
    "the excitation functions of the shadow profile functions  @xmath14 are also discussed .",
    "finally we summarize and conclude .",
    "although the original form of the bialas - bzdak model neglects the real part of the fsa in high energy elastic @xmath0 scattering , the model is based on glauber scattering theory and obeys unitarity constraints .",
    "the phenomenological generalization of the bialas - bzdak model  @xcite is based on the assumption , that the real part of the fsa is small , and can be handled perturbatively , so unitarity constraints are not violated strongly . however , it turned out that the addition of a small real part does not lead to a statistically acceptable description of totem data on elastic @xmath0 collisions at  @xmath10 7 tev . in this manuscript",
    ", we consider the case , when the real part of the fsa is not perturbatively small .",
    "we restart from @xmath8-matrix unitarity , and consider how the bb model can be extended to significant , real values of the fsa while satisfying the constraints of unitarity .      in this subsection",
    "some of the basic equations of quantum scattering theory are recapitulated .",
    "the scattering or @xmath8 matrix describes how a physical system changes in a scattering process .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath8 matrix ensures that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes of the scattering process is one .",
    "the unitarity of the scattering matrix  @xmath8 is expressed by the equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the identity matrix . the decomposition @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the transition matrix , leads the unitarity relation eq .",

    "the quark and the diquark are characterized with their positions with respect to the proton s center of mass using their transverse position vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the plane perpendicular to the proton s incident momentum .",

    "the parameters that have to be fitted to the data include the three scale parameters , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath59 , that fix the geometry of the proton - proton collisions , as well as the three additional parameters @xmath7 , @xmath84 and @xmath80 .",
    "two of the latter three can be fixed : @xmath107 if the diquark is very weakly bound , so that its mass is twice as large as that of the valence quark , while @xmath108 suggests that head - on @xmath86 collisions are inelastic with a probability of 1 .",
    "thus in the actual data analysis only four parameters are fitted to the data at each @xmath13 : the three scale parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath59 , as well as the parameter @xmath7 .",

    "<S> the bialas - bzdak model of elastic proton - proton scattering assumes a purely imaginary forward scattering amplitude , which consequently vanishes at the diffractive minima . </S>",
    "<S> we extended the model to arbitrarily large real parts in a way that constraints from unitarity are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting model is able to describe elastic @xmath0 scattering not only at the lower isr energies but also at @xmath17 tev in a statistically acceptable manner , both in the diffractive cone and in the region of the first diffractive minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross - section as well as the differential cross - section of elastic proton - proton scattering is predicted for the future lhc energies of @xmath18 , 13 , 14 , 15 tev and also to 28 tev . </S>",
    "<S> a non - trivial , significantly non - exponential feature of the differential cross - section of elastic proton - proton scattering is analyzed and the excitation function of the non - exponential behavior is predicted . the excitation function of the shadow profiles is discussed and related to saturation at small impact parameters . </S>"
