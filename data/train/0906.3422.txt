    "cluster algebras have been introduced by fomin and zelevinsky around 2000 and have enjoyed a remarkable success story in recent years .",
    "they attractively link various areas of mathematics , like combinatorics , algebraic lie theory , representation theory , algebraic geometry and integrable systems and have applications to mathematical physics . in an attempt to categorify cluster algebras ( without coefficients ) , cluster categories have been introduced by buan , marsh , reiten , reineke , todorov @xcite .",
    "more precisely , these are orbit categories of the form @xmath6 $ ] where @xmath7 is a quiver without oriented cycles , @xmath8 is the bounded derived category of the path algebra @xmath9 ( over an algebraically closed field @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12 $ ] are the auslander - reiten translation and shift functor on @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , these cluster categories are again triangulated categories by a result of keller @xcite .",
    "quivers of dynkin types @xmath13 play a special role in the theory of cluster algebras since they parametrize cluster - finite cluster algebras , by a seminal result of fomin and zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cluster categories @xmath14 where @xmath7 is a dynkin quiver are triangulated categories with finitely many indecomposable objects and their structure is well understood by work of amiot @xcite .",
    "important objects in cluster categories are the cluster - tilting objects .",
    "a cluster - tilted algebra of type @xmath7 is by definition the endomorphism algebra of a cluster - tilting object in the cluster category @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding cluster - tilted algebras of dynkin types @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath0 are of finite representation type and they can be constructed explicitly by quivers and relations .",
    "namely , the quivers of the cluster - tilted algebras of dynkin type @xmath7 are precisely the ones obtained from @xmath7 by performing finitely many quiver mutations . moreover , in this case the quiver of a cluster - tilted algebra uniquely determines the relations @xcite ; we shall review the corresponding algorithm in section 2 below .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of when two cluster - tilted algebras of dynkin type @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 have equivalent derived categories .",
    "the analogous question has been settled for cluster - tilted algebras of type @xmath18 by buan and vatne @xcite ( see also work of murphy on the more general case of @xmath19-cluster tilted algebras of type @xmath18 @xcite ) and by the first author @xcite for type @xmath20 . note that the cluster - tilted algebras in these cases are gentle algebras @xcite .",
    "it turns out that two cluster - tilted algebras of type @xmath18 are derived equivalent if and only if their quivers have the same number of 3-cycles . for distinguishing such algebras up to derived equivalence one uses the determinants of the cartan matrices ;",
    "these have been determined explicitly for arbitrary gentle algebras by the second author in @xcite .    a derived equivalence classification of cluster - tilted algebras of other dynkin types @xmath17 and @xmath0 has been open . in this paper",
    "we settle this question for type @xmath0 , i.e.  we obtain a complete derived equivalence classification for cluster - tilted algebras of types @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "there are two natural approaches to address derived equivalence classification problems of a given collection of algebras arising from some combinatorial data .",
    "the top - to - bottom approach is to divide these algebras into equivalence classes according to some invariants of derived equivalence , so that algebras belonging to different classes are not derived equivalent .",
    "the bottom - to - top approach is to systematically construct , based on the combinatorial data , tilting complexes yielding derived equivalences between pairs of these algebras and then to arrange these algebras into groups where any two algebras are related by a sequence of such derived equivalences . to obtain a complete derived equivalence classification one has to combine these approaches and hope that the two resulting partitions of the entire collection of algebras coincide .",
    "the invariant of derived equivalence we use in this paper is the integer equivalence class of the bilinear form represented by the cartan matrix of an algebra @xmath16 . as",
    "this invariant is sometimes arithmetically subtle to compute directly , we instead compute the determinant of the cartan matrix @xmath21 and the characteristic polynomial of its asymmetry matrix @xmath22 , defined whenever @xmath21 is invertible over @xmath23 , and encode them conveniently in a single polynomial that we call the _ polynomial associated with @xmath21_. this quantity is generally a weaker invariant of derived equivalence , but in our case it will turn out to be enough for the classification .",
    "note that unlike as in type @xmath16 , the determinant itself is not sufficient for distinguishing the algebras up to derived equivalence .",
    "we stress that the asymmetry matrix and its characteristic polynomial are well defined whenever the cartan matrix is invertible over @xmath23 , even without having any categorical meaning , as follows from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3 ) . in the special case",
    "when @xmath16 has finite global dimension , the asymmetry matrix @xmath24 , or better minus its transpose @xmath25 , is related to the coxeter transformation which does carry categorical meaning , and its characteristic polynomial is known as the coxeter polynomial of the algebra .",
    "the tilting complexes we use are inspired by quiver mutations in the following sense . for a vertex ,",
    "we consider all the incoming arrows and build , based on this combinatorial data , a two - term complex of projective modules , see also similar constructions in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we call a mutation at a vertex `` good '' if the corresponding complex is a tilting complex and moreover its endomorphism algebra is the cluster - tilted algebra of the mutated quiver . in other words , a `` good '' mutation produces a derived equivalence between the corresponding cluster - tilted algebras .",
    "of course , there are also `` bad '' mutations , for two reasons : the complex might not be a tilting complex or even if it is , its endomorphism algebra might not be a cluster - tilted algebra .",
    "it turns out that for cluster - tilted algebras of type @xmath0 the two approaches can be successfully combined to give a complete derived equivalence classification .",
    "more precisely , our main result is the following .    [ mainthm ] the following conditions are equivalent for two cluster - tilted algebras @xmath16 and @xmath26 of dynkin type @xmath0 :    1 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath26 have the same associated polynomial ; 2 .",
    "the cartan matrices of @xmath16 and @xmath26 represent equivalent bilinear forms over @xmath27 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath26 are derived equivalent ; 4 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath26 are connected via a sequence of `` good '' mutations .",
    "in addition to the above general statement we make the derived equivalence classification explicit by providing complete lists of the algebras contained in each derived equivalence class ( up to sink / source equivalence ) .",
    "note that the implication ( c ) @xmath28 ( b ) holds in general for any two ( finite - dimensional ) algebras @xmath16 and @xmath26 , and that the implication ( b ) @xmath29 ( a ) holds whenever the associated polynomials are defined , i.e. when the cartan matrices are invertible over @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , for cluster - tilted algebras the implication ( d ) @xmath28 ( c ) is evident from the definition .",
    "we also note that since the cluster - tilted algebras we consider involve only zero- and commutativity - relations ,",
    "they can in fact be defined over any commutative ring @xmath10 .",
    "the combinatorial nature of our construction of tilting complexes via `` good '' mutations will then imply that such algebras corresponding to quivers in the same class will be derived equivalent for any @xmath10 .",
    "therefore one may view the derived equivalences arising from `` good '' mutations as `` universal '' , being independent on the auxiliary algebraic data ( specified by @xmath10 ) .",
    "let us briefly describe the above main result in some more detail . for precise definitions of the cluster - tilted algebras involved",
    "we refer to sections 3 ( type @xmath1 ) , a / b ( type @xmath2 ) , and c / d ( type @xmath3 ) below . in the following tables",
    "we list the associated polynomials of the cluster - tilted algebras , and also the total number of algebras in each derived equivalence class .    for type",
    "@xmath1 the mutation class consists of 67 quivers .",

    "we collect some background material ; in particular we recall the notion of quiver mutation , describe the results of buan , marsh and reiten on cluster - tilted algebras of finite representation type , review the fundamental results on derived equivalences and then discuss invariants of derived equivalence such as the equivalence class of the euler form , in particular leading to the determinant of the cartan matrix and the characteristic polynomial of its asymmetry matrix as derived invariants .    in section 3",
    "we discuss derived equivalences for cluster - tilted algebras of dynkin type @xmath1 in detail .",
    "the quivers of these algebras are given by those in the mutation class of type @xmath1 ; this mutation class can easily be reproduced by the reader using keller s software @xcite .",
    "we first give in section 3 a list of the derived equivalence classes , sorted by the associated polynomial which is the crucial invariant for our purposes .",
    "we also give the cartan matrix of one representative in each class which we shall need later in our computations .    as main result of this section",
    "we prove the main theorem [ mainthm ] for type @xmath1 . to this end",
    "we have to find explicit tilting complexes for the cluster - tilted algebras of type @xmath1 and we have to determine their endomorphism rings .",
    "the necessary calculations are carried out in detail in sections [ sec : det2 ] - [ sec : det4 ] .",
    "the tilting complexes we use are closely related to quiver mutations at a single vertex , and we explain this construction in section [ sec : vertex - to - complex ] .    for types",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 we have followed a different strategy of presentation since the number of algebras involved becomes very large .",
    "we first list the algebras but without drawing the quivers ; again , the quivers can be found using keller s software .",
    "we then present the results on derived equivalences for cluster - tilted algebras of types @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a very concise form which is explained at the beginning of the respective sections . for each group of algebras with the same associated polynomial we then provide tilting complexes and list their endomorphism rings , but without giving any details on the calculations .",
