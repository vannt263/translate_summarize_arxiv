    ", the state of wet granular media can be categorized into four states in the order of increasing liquid content : pendular , funicular , capillary and slurry state @xcite . in our study , we focus on the pendular state of granular media , where the liquid in granular beds exists only in the form of liquid bridges between the contact points of particles .",
    "a granular bed in the pendular state has low liquid content and is the most prevalent state of natural soil @xcite .",
    "in our experiments , a liquid drop of diameter @xmath0 is released from a height @xmath1 above the surface of a granular bed that has a fixed volume fraction of particles , @xmath2 , and a saturation of liquid , @xmath3 .",

    "the yield stress of a granular bed becomes so large that the typical liquid drop we use in our experiments with @xmath12 mm can not create appreciable craters on the granular surface near its terminal velocity .    to avoid the evaporation of liquid from the granular bed that will cause a time - dependent saturation during experiments , we choose light mineral oil ( density @xmath13 g/@xmath14 , viscosity @xmath15 mpa@xmath16s and surface tension @xmath17 mn / m ) as our saturating liquid .",
    "mineral oil has a vapor pressure smaller than 13 pa at room temperature .",
    "thus , the evaporation of the liquid is negligible during our experiments . for preparing a wet granular bed ,",
    "we first dissolve a control amount of mineral oil in 200 ml of hexane .",
    "then , 200 g of soda - lime glass beads are added into the mixture of mineral oil and hexane .",
    "the resulting slurry is sonicated for 30 minutes and then placed in a hood for 12 hours to allow for the evaporation of hexane .",
    "the process of sonication employs sound waves to agitate particles in the slurry , which promotes the mixing of mineral oil with particles .",
    "finally , the granular particles are dried for 24 hours at 54 @xmath18c to completely remove the excess hexane .",
    "the above procedure ensures that even a small amount of mineral oil can be uniformly coated on the surface of granular beads .",
    "we test the granular particles treated by hexane alone without mineral oil .",
    "the dynamics and the morphologies of liquid - drop impact cratering on the granular bed composed of such particles are indistinguishable from experiments on granular bed composed of original dry granular particles .",

    "two different methods are adopted to measure the yield stress of beds at different saturations .",
    "firstly , following previous studies on solid - sphere impact cratering in wet granular media @xcite , we use a rotating vane rheometer ( ta ar - g2 ) to measure the shear stress of wet beds ( fig .",

[ equ4 ] ) , where @xmath44 are measured from compression experiments.,width=321 ]    when a solid sphere or a liquid drop impacts on a granular surface , granular particles on the flat surface yield mainly due to compression rather than shear . therefore , the yield stress of a granular bed under compression is more appropriate in characterizing the strength of a wet granular bed under impact .",
    "thus , in the second method , we measure the compressive stress of a granular bed by compressing an 8 mm - in - diameter stainless steel circular plate into a wet granular bed at a rate of 0.1 mm / s in the quasi - static limit .",
    "the normal force or stress on the plate is recorded by using a rheometer equipped with normal force gauges ( ta g2-rsa ) . for a typical stress - distance curve ( fig .",
    "[ figure7]a ) , the compressive stress first increases sharply when the plate touches the surface of a granular bed .",
    "granular particles rearrange under the plate to adapt for the flat surface of the plate .",
    "the bed underneath the plate is compressed slightly with the average spacing between the granular particles reduced . when the plate is further pushed into the media , the bed yields .",
    "particles are pushed upward against gravity around the circumference of the plate . in this regime",
    ", the stress exhibits a plateau , which can be used to quantify the yield stress of a granular bed under compression ( fig .",
    "[ figure7]a ) . when the plate is pushed even further into the media beyond the plateau regime , the compressive stress increases again in an approximately linear fashion ( not shown ) @xcite . since the depth of liquid - drop impact craters are typically a couple of millimeters ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]b , d , f ) , the yield stress measured near the surface of a granular bed is directly relevant to liquid - drop impact cratering .",

    "we further showed that such a scaling can be quantitatively understood by combining the scaling of solid - sphere impact cratering in the strength regime with the unique energy partition of liquid - drop impact cratering .",
    "in particular , we showed that the coefficient characterizing the energy partition of liquid - drop impacts follows a simple formula , @xmath66 , independent of the saturation of granular beds .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated that the strength of a granular bed relevant to impact cratering should be measured through compression rather than shear experiments .",
    "the results from our study are directly relevant to the geological processes of raindrop impact cratering and should be useful in interpreting the morphologies of raindrop impact craters .",
    "for example , the size of raindrop impact craters on fossilized granular beds have been used to infer the properties of earth s atmosphere in the geological past @xcite .",
    "som and co - workers estimated the air density on earth 2.7 billion years ago from the terminal velocity of raindrops , where the relation between the size of impact craters and the terminal velocity of water drops is critical for the accuracy of the estimate @xcite . here , we demonstrate that the dynamics and the morphologies of raindrop impact cratering in wet granular media qualitatively differ from those in dry granular media even when the bed contains only a small amount of liquid , a condition that is almost unavoidable in raining .",
    "thus , the lower limit of the terminal velocity of raindrops and , therefore , the upper limit of the air density on earth estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite need to be revisited to explicitly consider the degree of liquid saturations .    finally , although increasing @xmath3 above a few percentages into the funicular state of granular media will result in a granular bed that is too stiff to be able to produce any appreciable liquid - drop impact craters , increasing @xmath3 further into the capillary and slurry state can reverse the trend and considerably reduce the yield stress of a granular bed @xcite .",

    "<S> combining high - speed photography with laser profilometry , we study the dynamics and the morphology of liquid - drop impact cratering in wet granular media  a ubiquitous phenomenon relevant to many important geological , agricultural , and industrial processes . by systematically investigating important variables such as impact energy , the size of impinging drops and the degree of liquid saturation in granular beds , </S>",
    "<S> we uncover a novel scaling for the size of impact craters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this scaling can be explained by considering the balance between the inertia of impinging drops and the strength of impacted surface . </S>",
    "<S> such a theoretical understanding confirms that the unique energy partition originally proposed for liquid - drop impact cratering in dry granular media also applies for impact cratering in wet granular media . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that compressive stresses , instead of shear stresses , control granular impact cratering . </S>",
    "<S> our study enriches the picture of generic granular impact cratering and sheds light on the familiar phenomena of raindrop impacts in granular media . </S>"
