    "in recent seminal work , jeremy kahn and vladimir markovic showed that every cocompact lattice in @xmath2 contains infinitely many surface subgroups , i.e. subgroups which are isomorphic to the fundamental group of a closed surface @xcite .",
    "moreover , as a subgroup of @xmath2 , each of these groups is quasi - fuchsian , and every round circle in the ideal boundary of hyperbolic three - space is the limit in the hausdorff topology of a sequence of limit sets of such groups .    in view of a conjecture of gromov",
    "that every one - ended hyperbolic group contains a surface subgroup , it seems desirable to extend the result of kahn and markovic to a larger class of groups .",
    "the goal of this paper is to undertake such an extension to cocompact lattices in simple lie groups of rank one which are distinct from @xmath0 for @xmath3 .",
    "[ mainresult ] let @xmath4 be a simple rank one lie group of non - compact type distinct from @xmath0 for some @xmath3 and let @xmath5 be a cocompact lattice",
    ". then @xmath6 contains surface subgroups .    since by selberg s lemma every finitely generated subgroup of a linear group contains a torsion - free subgroup of finite index ( see @xcite for a proof ) , the theorem is an immediate consequence of the statement that every closed locally symmetric manifold @xmath7 of negative curvature which is different from a hyperbolic manifold of even dimension contains closed incompressible immersed surfaces .",
    "the proof of this fact uses the strategy developed by kahn and markovic .",
    "namely , the surfaces will be glued from immersed incompressible pants with geodesic boundary .",
    "these pants are viewed as topological objects , but they have geometric realizations as piecewise ruled surfaces which are close to totally geodesic pants .",
    "closeness in this sense can be quantified , and this allows to establish a glueing condition for such pants which results in an incompressible surface .",
    "this differential geometric viewpoint is the main novelty of this work .",
    "it also results in a significant simplification of the original construction for closed hyperbolic three - manifolds .",
    "the glueing condition can be expressed as a system of linear glueing equations , and the task is then to find a non - negative solution . for manifolds of higher dimension ,",
    "this turns out to be much more difficult than for hyperbolic three - manifolds , and this is also the place where our argument is not valid for even dimensional hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "we refer to section 7 for a more detailed discussion of this difficulty .",
    "we do not formulate an approximation result along the lines of the work of kahn and markovic since we are not aware of any interesting application , although suitable versions of such an approximation result hold as well .",
    "the paper is completely self - contained .",
    "some of our arguments are valid for arbitrary closed negatively curved manifolds with generic metrics , but we do not know whether the beautiful result of kahn and markovic holds true in this setting .",
    "in section [ cannon ] we collect some background and tools used later on , and we give a more detailed overview of the argument .    the major part of this work was carried out while i visited the ipam in los angeles .",
    "i am grateful to ipam for the hospitality , and to vladimir markovic for useful discussions .",
    "i am also grateful for the anonymous referees for pointing out an erraneous statement in an earlier version of this work , for informing me about the papers @xcite and for valuable comments geared at improving the exposition .",
    "this section has three parts .",
    "in the first part we give a short outline of the proof , enhancing its similiarities and differences to the argument of kahn and markovic .",
    "the second part summarizes those properties of rank one symmetric spaces which are used later on .",
    "in the third part we give a simple ( and well known to the experts but hard to find in the literature ) criterion for incompressibility of a surface in a closed nonpositively curved manifold .",
    "to prove theorem [ mainresult ] from the introduction , we construct closed surfaces @xmath8 with piecewise smooth locally @xmath9-metrics and piecewise smooth isometric immersions @xmath10 .",
    "the surfaces are constructed in such a way that they admit a distinguished _ pants decomposition _ @xmath11 which is mapped by @xmath12 to a collection of closed geodesics in @xmath7 .",
    "such a pants decomposition consists of a collection of pairwise disjoint simple closed geodesics which decompose @xmath8 into _ pairs of pants _ ,",
    "i.e. three - holed spheres .",
    "the image under @xmath12 of each pair of pants is a piecewise smooth isometrically immersed surface in @xmath7 which is geometrically close to a totally geodesic totally real hyperbolic subsurface .    to show that these surfaces are incompressible we associate to each component of the thin part of such a pair of pants an immersed totally geodesic totally real hyperbolic plane in @xmath7 .",
    "we then lift these immersed hyperbolic planes to the universal covering @xmath13 of @xmath7 and use these chains of planes to establish a sufficient condition for incompressibility which relies on the simple characterization formulated in proposition [ cannonmap ] .",
    "the construction is carried out in sections 5 and 6 , and it is valid for symmetric spaces of higher rank as well , where we work with totally geodesic hyperbolic planes of constant curvature @xmath14 ( which therefore intersect a given maximal flat in at most one geodesic ) .",
    "the construction of the basic building blocks of the surfaces , the pairs of pants , is carried out in section 4 and uses the strategy from @xcite . in our approach , it is essential to equip these pairs of pants with a geometric structure and to keep track of the monodromy defined by parallel transport of frames along boundary geodesics .    glueing the pants to closed surfaces which satisfy the condition for incompressibility established in section 6 amounts to solving a glueing equation .",
    "for this we use ideas from @xcite : project the lebesgue measure on suitable frame bundles to the sphere bundles over closed geodesics and use these projected measures to attach pants along their boundary geodesics in such a way that the glueing equation is fulfilled .",
    "the projected measures are not so easy to control . if the monodromy of a closed geodesic has a single fixed real line ( which may happen in even dimensional hyperbolic manifolds ) then it is not clear whether the projected measure is symmetric enough to construct a solution of the glueing equation , and this difficulty is the reason why our proof of theorem [ mainresult ] fails for even dimensional real hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "we refer to the short section [ even ] for a more detailed discussion of this difficulty .",
    "section 3 contains some distance estimates in universal coverings of surfaces with @xmath15-metric which are equipped with a pants decomposition with specific properties .",
    "the surfaces we construct will be equipped with pants decompositions with precisely these properties .",
    "the results in this work are formulated so that they can easily be used in more general situations than the one we consider here .",
