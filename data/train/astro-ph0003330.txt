    "searches for gravitational microlensing events , over 500 of which have now been observed , provide an important constraint on the mass in the inner galaxy .",
    "deriving a mass from an observed optical depth is not straightforward because one usually has only limited knowledge of the distances to the stars that are lensed , and even less information about the distances to the deflecting objects .",
    "kuijken ( 1997 ) showed that the _ minimum _ mass required to generate a given optical depth towards the galactic centre from an axisymmetric distribution of matter can be determined without any knowledge of the location of the lenses provided one knows the optical depth to a source on the galaxy s symmetry axis .",
    "he showed , further , that the minimum mass required by the then available microlensing data was barely compatible with the measured rotation curve and local mass density . here",
    "we generalize kuijken s argument to the case of elliptical distributions of matter , which require less matter for a given optical depth .",
    "the apparent magnitude of a red - clump star at the galactic centre is relatively bright , so the microlensing optical depth to such objects can be determined without significant uncertainty due to blending .",
    "moreover , the red - clump stars must follow the general distribution of near infra - red light quite closely , because they are part of the population of evolved stars that are responsible for most of the galaxy s near - ir luminosity ( mcwilliam & rich , 1994 ) .",
    "given this , it proves possible to deduce from the measured mean optical depth of the clump giants the optical depth to a source on the galaxy s axis .    from 13 lensing events",
    "alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) inferred @xmath0 for clump giants centred on @xmath1 . from a difference image analysis of observations that include 99 events , alcock et al .",
    "( 2000b ) recently measured @xmath2 for a mix of stars centred on @xmath3 , and from this measurement deduced for the same direction @xmath4 for bulge sources after making allowance for the lower optical depth for lensing of disk stars . here",
    "we use our results to show that such large values of the optical depth for microlensing of bulge sources can not be reconciled with measurements of the rotation curve and local mass density , even by elliptical galaxy models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we rederive kuijken s result , generalize it to elliptical systems , and demonstrate that it is applicable to the measured clump - giant optical depth . in ",
    "3 we show that axisymmetric models are very clearly excluded . in ",
    "4 we show that barred models can be excluded , albeit with somewhat less confidence .",
    "we determine the minimum mass in stellar objects that is required to generate a given optical depth @xmath5 towards sources that lie on the galaxy s symmetry axis a distance @xmath6 from the galactic plane .",
    "the optical depth to microlensing of a stellar object at distance @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the distance to the lens and @xmath10 consider the contribution to @xmath5 from a circular band of mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 around the galactic centre .",
    "if we assume that the band s surface density never increases with distance from the plane , then its mass will be minimized for a given optical depth when its surface density is constant and the line - of - sight to the source just cuts its edge .",
    "so we take the band s half - width to be @xmath13 , which makes the band s surface density @xmath14 substituting this into equation ( [ basiceq ] ) we find the band s optical depth to be ( kuijken , 1997 ) @xmath15 independent of radius .",
    "realistically we must assume that the surface density of the band falls off with distance from the plane , and if this decline is exponential with the optimal scale - height ( @xmath16 $ ] ) , the band s mass must be e times that given by equation ( [ axieq ] ) for a given optical depth , while if the vertical density profile is gaussian with optimal scale - height ( @xmath16 $ ] ) equation ( [ axieq ] ) underestimates the band s mass by a factor @xmath17 . given the implausibility of assuming that the band s scale height is optimal , we can safely conclude that the minimum stellar mass required in a circular band if the observations are to be met is @xmath18    note that the minimum mass estimate ( [ axieq2 ] ) holds also if the mass is widely distributed in radius rather than concentrated in a single band , because we can imagine a radially continuous mass distribution to be made up of a large number of bands , and we have shown that the optical depth contributed by each band depends only on its mass when the band is optimally configured .",
    "can one achieve a higher optical depth within a give mass budget by making the bands elliptical rather than circular ?",
    "imagine deforming an initially circular band into an elliptical shape while holding constant the radius @xmath12 at which the line of sight to our sources cuts the band .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if the column density through the band to the sources is to be independent of the band s eccentricity @xmath19 , its mass @xmath20 must satisfy @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the angle between the band s major axis and the sun  centre line . for @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath20 is a minimum with respect to @xmath19 at @xmath24 for @xmath25 , a value favoured by binney , gerhard & spergel ( 1997 ) , the optimal axis ratio is @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; for @xmath28 , we find @xmath29 and @xmath30 . hence",
    ", making the bands elliptical realistically reduces the mass required to generate a given optical depth by at most @xmath31 to @xmath32 physically , there is an optimum eccentricity because the major axis of the ellipse grows with @xmath19 , and for large @xmath19 this growth in scale overwhelms the reduction in the mass per unit length around the ellipse that is possible because the line of sight intersects the ellipse ever more obliquely as @xmath19 is increased .",
    "we wish to apply these formulae to sources that are broadly distributed around the galactic centre , rather than lying precisely on the galaxy s symmetry axis .",
    "how much error will we incur by so doing ?",
    "suppose there is a thin circular band of lenses of radius @xmath12 and imagine moving two sources along the line of sight away from the axis .",
    "one source moves toward and one away from the observer , with @xmath33 being the distance of each source from the axis .",
    "one can easily calculate as a function of @xmath33 the average , @xmath34 , of the optical depths for each source to be microlensed by the ring .",
    "we then evaluate the ratio @xmath35 for @xmath36 , when both sources lie inside the ring , the mean optical depth is insensitive to @xmath33 because to first order in @xmath33 the lower optical depth to the nearer source is compensated by the higher optical depth to the further one .",
    "for @xmath37 , when the sources are outside the ring , the mean optical depth rises steadily with @xmath33 because there is nothing to offset the gain in optical depth for the further source . to estimate the error involved in assuming that all sources lie on the axis , we calculate the ratio @xmath38 of the total mean optical depth due to a series of rings when the sources lie distance @xmath33 either side of the axis , and when they lie on axis . in this calculation",
    "we assume that the surface density of each band , @xmath39 , is given by equation ( [ sigmameq ] ) with the mass of each band proportional to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "[ spread2 ] shows the ratio @xmath42 as a function of @xmath33 .    both the apparent - magnitude distribution of clump giants reported by stanek et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and the cobe / dirbe near - infrared photometry of the galaxy imply that @xmath43 of the clump giants seen towards a typical macho field lie within @xmath44 of the point at which the line of sight passes closest to the galactic centre ( bissantz & gerhard , 2000 ) . from fig .",
    "[ spread2 ] it now follows that the maximum error made in @xmath5 by placing any of these sources on the axis is @xmath45 .",
    "for the @xmath31 of sources that lie within @xmath46 of the point of closest approach the maximum error is @xmath47 .    whereas the non - zero distribution in depth of the clump giants causes us to slightly underestimate the mean optical depth to them when we place them on the galactic axis , the fact that many of the macho fields lie at @xmath48 gives rise to an error of the opposite sign .",
    "maps of microlensing optical depth from models based on the cobe / dirbe data ( e.g. , fig .",
    "7 of bissantz et al . ,",
    "1997 ) show that the errors from this source are also very small .",
    "we have seen that the mean microlensing optical depth towards bulge sources at @xmath49 gives a reasonable approximation to the optical depth @xmath5 in the formulae above with @xmath50 .",
    "setting @xmath5 equal to the value @xmath51 inferred by alcock et al.(2000b ) we find @xmath52    a crude estimate of the mass required to generate the circular speed at the sun is @xmath53 which is barely more than the minimum stellar mass for an axisymmetric body from microlensing observations .",
    "the naive estimate ( [ naive ] ) is for a spherical mass distribution , whereas the mass estimates of equation ( [ micros ] ) are based on strongly flattened mass distributions , and @xmath54 for a flattened body can differ significantly from @xmath54 for the spherical body that has the same cumulative mass function @xmath55 . consider therefore fig .",
    "[ vcaxi ] , which shows @xmath54 for two axisymmetric mass distributions in which the vertical density profile is a gaussian in @xmath56 with the scale - height @xmath57 chosen to maximize the microlensing optical depth to @xmath58 subject to the auxiliary condition @xmath59 .",
    "the masses of the two bodies are both @xmath60 to @xmath61 , so they both produce optical depth @xmath62 to a source at @xmath58 .",
    "one body has a surface density @xmath63 , with @xmath41 , whereas the other has @xmath64 .",
    "the rotation curve of the exponential model clearly exceeds the approximate fit to the measured circular speed that is given by the short - dashed curve : @xmath65 ( binney et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "by contrast , the circular - speed curve of the power - law model lies well below the measured value of @xmath66 even though it corresponds to the same mass profile @xmath67 .",
    "the reason for this is quite subtle : in this power - law disk there is at any radius @xmath68 a substantial outward pull from rings at @xmath69 , and this outward pull more than compensates for the fact that matter at @xmath70 exerts a stronger inward pull than it would if it were distributed spherically .",
    "( the inward and outward pulls cancel exactly for a disk with @xmath71 . )",
    "although the power - law disk does not violate the constraint imposed by the galaxy s rotation curve , it can be ruled out observationally because it contributes too much stellar mass to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "specifically , its volume - density at the sun is @xmath72 compared to the measured value @xmath73 ( crz et al . , 1998 ;",
    "holmberg & flynn , 2000 ) and its surface density is @xmath74 compared to an estimated @xmath75 in stars at @xmath76 and the measured @xmath77 in all matter at @xmath78 ( kuijken & gilmore , 1991 ) . moreover ,",
    "the power - law model s large local mass density is vital for its success in evading the circular - speed limit in that it is intimately connected with the strong outward pull of material at @xmath79 .",
    "hence , if we taper the disk near @xmath80 to avoid conflict with the observed local densities , we will immediately generate a violation of the limit on the circular speed .",
    "a little numerical experimentation suffices to convince one that there is no way of generating the required optical depth to @xmath58 with a circular disk without violating either the constraint on the circular speed or that on the local mass density .",
    "there is , moreover , negligible probability that the galaxy will be structured vertically so as to maximize @xmath5 towards @xmath58 .",
    "hence , we may be pretty sure that the measured optical depth is not produced by an axisymmetric galaxy ( kuijken 1997 ) .",
    "since it is now generally accepted that the galaxy contains a bar , the conclusion we have just reached may not be surprising . equations ( [ micros ] ) show that non - axisymmetry can in principle reduce the requirement for stellar mass to half that required in the stellar case .",
    "it is not in practice possible to reduce the required stellar mass by so large a factor , however , because the structure of the galaxy s stellar bar is strongly constrained by both near - ir photometry ( blitz & spergel , 1991 ; bissantz et al . , 1997 ) and",
    "radio - frequency observations of gas that flows in the galactic plane ( englmaier & gerhard , 1999 ; fux , 1999 ) .",
    "we estimate the reduction in mass that can be achieved as follows .    we suppose that the surface density of the disk projected along @xmath56 is exponential , but that at @xmath81 the material is arranged on elliptical rings ; at every radius the vertical density profile is gaussian with the dispersion that maximizes the optical depth for given mass subject to the condition @xmath59 .",
    "then , the circular speed of the disk will be the same as that of an axisymmetric disk of the same mass , while the optical depth will be given by @xmath82 where @xmath19 is determined from equation ( [ emineq ] ) and @xmath83 is the fraction of the disk s mass , @xmath84 , that lies inside @xmath85 .",
    "we determine @xmath84 by setting @xmath86 in equation ( [ mtoteq ] ) and evaluate the resulting curve @xmath54 .",
    "the long - dashed curve in fig .  [ vcaxi ] shows the result for @xmath41 and @xmath25 .",
    "now the constraint on @xmath66 is not violated , but that on the local surface density is : the model has @xmath87 at @xmath80 .",
    "our assumption that the central galaxy is barred makes mass placed inside @xmath85 roughly twice as effective at generating optical depth as mass placed at @xmath88 .",
    "can we then evade both constraints by concentrating mass in the bar ?",
    "[ vcbulge ] shows an attempt along these lines .",
    "the model is made up of two exponential components .",
    "the larger has a scale length @xmath89 and its mass is determined by requiring that at @xmath80 its surface density is @xmath90 . at @xmath91",
    "this component has the eccentricity required by equation ( [ emineq ] ) for @xmath25 .",
    "the smaller component has this same eccentricity throughout , scale - length @xmath92 and the mass it requires to make the combined optical depth of both components @xmath93 .    in fig .",
    "[ vcbulge ] this model s rotation curve has a broad peak around @xmath94 at @xmath95 .",
    "given the uncertainty in the observed value of @xmath66 in this region , where the bar is dynamically important , it might seem reasonable to consider that this barred model is compatible with both the rotation - curve and the local - density constraints .",
    "however , there are several grounds for caution :    1 .",
    "our models assume that the disk becomes extremely thin near the sun and hence violate the oort limit , @xmath96 ( crz et al . , 1998 ;",
    "holmberg & flynn , 2000 ) .",
    "we can avoid this problem by imposing @xmath97 on the scale height , which would significantly reduce the microlensing efficiency of rings closer to the sun than @xmath98 . however , the integrated effect can be small ; for example , in the case of the model shown in fig .",
    "[ vcbulge ] , imposing @xmath99 would reduce the optical depth by only 3% .",
    "2 .   dynamical models of gas flow in the inner galaxy",
    "imply that the circular speed rises more steeply at @xmath100 than fig .",
    "[ vcbulge ] implies .",
    "specifically , one requires an inner lindblad resonance at @xmath101 and at @xmath102 dense gas is observed on @xmath103 orbits at speeds that imply @xmath104 .",
    "the model for which fig .",
    "[ vcbulge ] is plotted predicts @xmath105 at @xmath106 because it places significant mass at distances @xmath107 from the plane , where it can generate useful optical depth . to raise @xmath66 at @xmath108 much of this matter",
    "will have to be moved down , closer to the galactic centre , thus reducing the model s optical depth .",
    "moreover , near - infrared photometry confirms that at @xmath108 most of the bulge s mass does lie below @xmath109 .",
    "not all mass causes microlensing . about @xmath110 of the mass of the inner galaxy",
    "is made up of gas . at @xmath111",
    "most mass is contained in a dark halo , most of which does not cause microlensing ( alcock 2000a ) .",
    "the dark halo is thought to make a significant contribution to the local circular speed , and its density surely increases inwards .",
    "hence , the peak circular speed of whatever component causes microlensing should be strictly less than the measured value of @xmath66 ; it is not satisfactory to conclude that it may be no larger than the measured value .",
    "most importantly , it is not plausible that the inner galaxy is structured so as to maximize the optical depth in a particular direction from a particular star .",
    "in fact mass models obtained by deprojecting the near - infrared photometry and assuming that mass follows light are able to reproduce many kinematic properties of the inner galaxy ( englmaier & gerhard , 1999 ; hfner et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "if mass even approximately follows light , the photometry implies that the inner galaxy is not structured so as to maximize the optical depth produced by a given mass .",
    "in fact the recent model of bissantz & gerhard ( 2000 ) yields @xmath112 in baade s window .",
    "thus , we conclude that the marginal satisfaction of the three principal constraints [ optical depth , @xmath66 , @xmath113 that fig .",
    "[ vcbulge ] implies can not be considered satisfactory and that even realistic barred models can not simultaneously satisfy all the observational constraints ."
