    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted much research attention in recent years because of their importance in the fundamental understanding of physics and potential applications in electronic devices , information processing , and non - linear optics .",
    "the electronic properties of qds have been intensively studied in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally , and a clear understanding of much of the basic physics of the quantum confinement effects of electrons in qds has been achieved@xcite . on the other hand , the vibration properties of qds , i.e. , the confinement of phonon modes in qds , are less understood .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical understanding of phonon modes in qds are based on the continuum dielectric models .",
    "the analytic expression of the eigenfunctions of lo phonons and surface optical phonons of small spherical @xcite and cylindrical@xcite qds are derived and the electron - phonon interactions are calculated .",
    "the extended continuum dielectric model@xcite coupling the mechanical vibrational amplitudes and the electrostatic potential has made major improvements over classical dielectric models in the study of phonon modes in qds .",
    "however , one of the basic assumptions of all dielectric models is that the material is homogeneous and isotropic , that is only valid in the long wavelength limit . when the size of qds is small , in the range of a few nm , the continuum dielectric models are intrinsically limited .",
    "many optical , transport , and thermal properties of quantum dots are related to phonon behavior in qds .",
    "the theoretical treatment of these properties requires a reliable description of phonon modes and electron - phonon interaction potential in qds .",
    "one of the major difficulties of the microscopic modeling of phonon modes in qds is its computational intensity .",
    "for example , for a gaas qd of size of about 8.0 nm , there are 11,855 atoms in it . considering the three dimensional motion of each atom ,",
    "the dynamic matrix is in the order of 35,565 .",
    "this is an intimidating task even with the most advanced computers . in recent years , we have developed a microscopic valence force filed model ( vffm)@xcite to study phonon modes in qds by employing the projection operators of the irreducible representations of the group theory to reduce the computational intensity . by employing the group theory , for example , the above matrix of size of 35,565 can be reduced to five matrices in five different representations of a@xmath1 , a@xmath2 , e , t@xmath1 , and t@xmath2 , with the sizes of 1592 , 1368 , 2960 , 4335 , and 4560 respectively .",
    "therefore , the original problem is reduced to a problem that can be easily handled by most reasonable computers .",
    "this allows not only the investigation of phonon modes in qds with a much larger size , but also the investigation of phonon modes in qds with different symmetries .",
    "these investigations lead to many interesting physics that otherwise can not be revealed@xcite . with this model ,",
    "we have studied the size effects of phonon modes in semiconductor quantum dots , including qds of one material , such as gaas or inas , as well as qds with a core of one material embedded in a shell of another material , such as gaas cores embedded in alas shells . to further develop our theoretical model in investigations of properties of qds , in this article ,",
    "we have studied the size effects of raman intensity in semiconductor qds with the same model .",
    "it is well - known that the measurement of raman spectra of a crystals is one of the most important methods for obtaining information about their lattice vibrations@xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate the geometry , the nature , and the structures of qds @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical calculations on raman scattering are based on phenomenological model @xcite .",
    "recently there are calculations based on microscopic models @xcite , but because of the limitation on the computational intensity , the size range of the qds that can be handled is limited .    in this article",
    ", we have calculated the raman intensities of nanoscale si qds by using the results of the vffm together with a bond polarizability approximation ( bpa ) @xcite .",
    "the calculated results are then compared with the available experimental data .",
    "we also hope that our calculations can further stimulate more experimental measurements on raman intensities of semiconductor qds .",
    "the article is organized as the following . in sections",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical models of vffm and bpa ; in section iii , we show our calculated results of raman intensities and have some discussions ; and section iv is a summary .",
    "in general , the theoretical model , vffm , that we used to investigate phonon modes in qds can be used to study phonon modes in groups iv , iii - v , and ii - vi semiconductors . in this model ,",
    "the change of the total energy due to the lattice vibration is considered as two parts , the change of the energy due to the short - range interactions and the change of the energy due to the long range coulomb interaction :    @xmath3    where the short - range interaction describes the covalent bonding , and the long range part approximates the coulomb interactions of polar semiconductor compounds . for the short range part , we employed a vffm with only two parameters as the following@xcite :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two parameters describing the energy change due to the bond length change and the bond angle change respectively .",
    "the summation runs over all the bond lengths and bond angles .",
    "because each of these two parameters has a simple and clear physical meaning , this model allows us to treat the interaction between atoms near and at the surface appropriately .",
    "it can be further used to treat the effects of surface relaxations and reconstructions on the vibrations if necessary .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 used in our calculations for si are 49.1 and 1.07 ev respectively @xcite . since silicon is a homopolar semiconductor that all atoms are neutral , the long range coulomb interaction is not necessary .",
    "when considering the interaction between atoms , special attention is paid to atoms near the surfaces of the qds .",
    "more specifically , for the short range interaction , when an atom is located near the surface , interaction from its nearest neighboring atom is considered only if that specific nearest atom is within the qd , and interaction from its second neighboring atom is considered only if that specific second neighbor atom is in the qd as well as the nearest neighboring atom that makes the link between them .",
    "the second point is important , because it makes sense with the physics meanings of these two parameters , but it is easy to be neglected .    as we discussed in above section",
    ", we have employed the projection operators of the irreducible representations of the group theory to reduce the computational intensity @xcite when calculating phonon modes directly from the dynamic matrices . when the results of phonon modes are used to calculate the raman intensity of qds ,",
    "the advantage of applying the group theory to calculate phonon modes in different symmetries is even more obvious . because of the symmetry dependence of raman intensity , only phonon modes that are raman active in that specific symmetry are necessary to be considered .",
    "this further reduces the amount of calculations required .      with the vibrational normal modes obtained from the vffm described , we use the bpa @xcite to calculate raman scattering intensity of qds",
    "this bpa model was used in the prediction of raman intensities of semiconductor superlattices@xcite , fullerences@xcite , and nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the bpa@xcite associates an axially symmetric polarizability tensor with each bond as :    @xmath7\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is a unit matrix , @xmath9 is the mean polarizability , and @xmath10 describes the anisotropy of the polarizability .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of the bond length @xmath11 and not direction dependent . here",
    "@xmath12 is the bond vector connecting atoms @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath11 is the length of @xmath12 , and @xmath15 . with phonon vibrations we have @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the bond vector at equilibrium",
    ", @xmath18 is the displacement of atom @xmath13 , and @xmath19 is the relative displacement of atoms @xmath14 and @xmath13 . for phonon vibrations , the condition that @xmath20 always applies .",
    "therefore , the polaribility tensor @xmath21 can be expressed in power of the displacements @xmath19 in a talor s expansion .",
    "the constant term of this expansion , i.e. , @xmath22 , can be ignored , since the total contribution of this term from all bonds to the raman intensity vanishes . keeping the first order of @xmath19 in the taylor s expansion ,",
    "the polarizability tensor @xmath21 can be simplified as the following :    @xmath23 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this gives the complete scattering matrix @xmath70 .",
    "assume that qds orient randomly , all the possible incident directions should be averaged .",

    "in our calculations , we have calculated @xmath48 , 9@xmath49 , and 3@xmath50 according to the right - angle scattering equations ( 2.20 - 2.22 ) . for different incident light and scattering configurations ,",
    "the raman intensities are the linear combination of these three according to their stokes vectors .",
    "in this article we report calculated reduced raman scattering intensity , @xmath74 , for si qds with diameters from 15 to 76  . since @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are not accurately known a priori , these parameters used in our calculations satisfy@xcite    @xmath78    we noticed that in the early calculations of amorphous si @xcite @xmath79 was assigned because the observed intensity profiles @xmath56 and @xmath57 of si have the same shape . if @xmath80 , there would be no contribution to raman intensity from a@xmath1 modes . however , when the size of qds is small , the contribution from a@xmath1 modes might be important to consider , so we have assigned @xmath81 a number as above .",

    "we have also listed the related important data in table 1 that are numerically more clear .",
    "the data listed in table 1 in order are the diameters of the qds calculated ( @xmath69 ) , the number of atoms in the qds ( @xmath89 ) , the intensity of the highest peak of a@xmath1 modes ( @xmath90 ) , the intensity of the highest peak of e modes ( @xmath91 ) , the intensity of the highest peak of t@xmath2 modes in the low frequency range ( @xmath92 ) and in the high frequency range ( @xmath93 ) , the frequency of the first peak of a@xmath1 modes ( @xmath94 ) , the frequency of the first peak of e modes ( @xmath95 ) , the frequency of the first peak of t@xmath2 modes in the low frequency range ( @xmath96 ) , and the frequency of the highest peak of t@xmath2 modes in the high frequency range ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "all the intensities listed above are raman intensity per atom for easier comparison",
    ". we will discuss the important features of these results in detail next .      from figs .",
    "1 - 3 we see that in general , the major peaks in the high frequency range always have a t@xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the highest peaks correspond to t@xmath2 phonon modes with the highest frequencies .",
    "when the size of the qds increases , this frequency approaches the frequency of the optical phonon frequency of bulk si . theoretically speaking , when the size of qds approaches infinite , the total raman spectrum of qds approaches the raman spectrum of bulk si , and this will be the only peak left .    in our previous calculations of phonon modes in qds@xcite , we have discussed the size dependance of phonon modes with different symmetries .",
    "we have learned that phonon modes with different symmetries have different size dependance , and a@xmath1 modes usually have the strongest size effect . for quantum dots of zincblend semiconductors , such as gaas ,",
    "when the size of qds is big , the mode with the highest frequency has a@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "however , as the dot size decreases , there is a crossover of the symmetries , then the mode with the highest frequency has t@xmath2 symmetry . for si quantum dots studied in the present paper ,",
    "the mode with the highest frequency is always of a@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "however , the raman intensity of a@xmath1 modes decreases when the dot size increases , so the strongest high frequency mode is always of t@xmath2 symmetry .    when the size of qds decreases , the frequency of this t@xmath2 peak decreases . to show this more clearly , we enlarged the high frequency range of fig . 3 and plotted it as fig .",
    "4 . from the data listed in table 1 ,",
    "we know that when the diameters of si qds decreases from 75.79  to 14.11  , the frequency of the highest raman peak shifts from 518.3 @xmath88 to 506.4 @xmath88 ( the raman peak of bulk si is at 518.9 @xmath88 in our model ) .",
    "the systematic redshift of the longitudinal ( lo ) phonon peaks due to spacially confined phonon modes in nanocrystals in the size range of a few nm have been observed @xcite , and recently it has been observed by resonant raman scattering in three samples of ge nanocrystals in the size range of 4 - 10 nm @xcite .",
    "one more thing we notice from fig . 3 and fig . 4 for the high frequency peaks of t@xmath2 modes",
    "is that not only the highest intensity peak red shifts as dot size decreases , but also weaker peaks appear at the same time .",
    "experimentally it may be difficult to resolve all the weaker peaks because of broadening resulting from fluctuation in dot sizes . as a result one may observe an asymmetric broadening of the raman peak corresponding to the optical phonon as the dot size is reduced .",
    "this is indeed found in raman intensities of ge qds @xcite .",
    "one may attempt to inteprete this as an indication that the quality of the dots may be poorer leading to larger inhomogeneous broadening as dot size gets smaller .",
    "however , from our calculations on raman intensities of qds , one can notice that the red shift of the strongest t@xmath2 raman peak is smaller than the frequency spread of the weaker peaks which appear .",
    "in other words the broadening of the raman peak is larger than the red shift as the dot size decreases .",
    "this indicates that the observed broadening in raman measurements is not only due to the red shift of the peak alone , but there is also a contribution to this broadening from quantum size effect .      from figs . 1 - 3",
    ", we see that the frequency of the first peak in the low frequency range for all three different symmetries ( a@xmath1 , e , and t@xmath2 ) increases as the size of the qds decreases . from the data listed in table 1",
    ", we see that when the size of si qds decreases from 75.79  to 14.11  , the frequency of the first raman peak of a@xmath1 modes shifts from 28.6 @xmath88 to 129.8 @xmath88 , the first raman peak of e modes shifts from 8.6 @xmath88 to 46.7 @xmath88 , and the first raman peak with t@xmath2 symmetry shifts from 12.4 @xmath88 to 58.8 @xmath88 .",
    "the size effects of lowest frequencies of phonon modes in qds have been discussed in detail in our previous studies@xcite , and again this is shown in the calculated raman spectra .",
    "furthermore , we notice that even though the frequencies of the lowest frequency peak increase in all these three figures , they increase at a different rate .",
    "the lowest frequency of the a@xmath1 peak increases much faster than that of the other two . to show this more clearly , we plot the lowest frequency peaks versus the sizes of qds in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the lowest frequency of the a@xmath1 peak increases much faster than that of the other two , because that the a@xmath1 modes have the strongest quantum confinement effects@xcite .",
    "another feature of fig .",
    "5 is that the lowest frequencies of the raman peaks in the acoustic range are roughly proportional to the inverse of the qds diameters , which was first observed by duval and his co - workers @xcite .",
    "this was recently observed in si nanocrystals @xcite , and it was noticed that the depolarized raman spectra appear at much lower frequencies than the polarized ones . not only our results agree with the experimental observations , we also learned that this is actually due to the symmetry dependence of the confinement effect of phonon modes , i.e. , the a@xmath1 modes have the strongest confinement effects .      in fig . 1",
    ", we see that at the low frequency range of the a@xmath1 modes , the raman spectra is dominated by a series of nearly evenly spaced peaks in the acoustical phonon range . as the size decreases , the spacing increases .",
    "this can be understood from the folding of acoustic phonons .",
    "since the a@xmath1 modes vibrate in the radical direction , when the radius of the qds increases approximately one lattice constant , there will be one more folding due to the confinement of the qds along the radial direction .",
    "this should be observable by raman scattering , and we are expecting such observations .      since raman intensities plotted in figs .",
    "1 - 3 are in arbitrary unit , the size effects on strength of raman peaks are not shown clearly in these figures . to show it more clearly , we have plotted the raman intensity per atom versus diameters of qds for the low frequency a@xmath1 peaks , the low frequency e peaks , the low frequency t@xmath2 peaks , and the high frequency t@xmath2 peaks in fig .",
    "6 . for a@xmath1 raman spectra",
    "there are several high peaks , and we choose the strength of the highest peak ( when the size is less than 30  , this peak is not the peak with the lowest frequency ) . in fig .",
    "6 we see that the strength of low frequency peaks ( a@xmath1 , e , and t@xmath2 ) decreases fast as the size of qds increases , and the strength of high frequency peaks ( t@xmath2 ) remains a constant in qds of all sizes .",
    "this indicates that even though in bulk material only one major peak can be measured , when the size of qds decreases , other peaks in the low frequency range will appear . of these low frequency raman peaks ,",
    "the most noticable ones are probably the evenly spaced a@xmath1 peaks in the polarized spectra .",
    "such evenly spaced a@xmath1 peaks should be observable .",
    "we want to emphasize that in fig .",
    "6 , the raman intensity shown is from one calculated highest raman peak , either in the low frequency range or in the high frequency range .",
    "experimentally the presence of multiple raman peaks as shown in figs .",
    "1 - 4 may not be resolvable due to size fluctuation , and in stead a broadened peak is observed .",
    "typically in such situation all the raman intensity should be intergrated together to obtain the total strength of the raman peak . to compare with the experimental results",
    ", we summed the calculated raman intensities ( without broadening ) for all a@xmath1 , e , and t@xmath2 modes respactively and show them for qds with different sizes in fig .",
    "we can see that all the raman intensities will increase when the size of qds get smaller .",
    "when the qds get larger , the raman intensity of t@xmath2 mode will approach to the raman intensity of bulk crystal and others will approach to zero .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with what was observed in ge qds @xcite .",
    "one more thing we want to comment on from figs .",
    "1 - 3 and fig . 6",
    "is that for large size qds , the major peak of the raman spectra is derived from the t@xmath2 high frequency mode .",
    "this peak approaches the optical phonon peak in the bulk raman spectra when the size of qds is large .",
    "when the size of qds decreases , more and stronger peaks at the lower frequency range show up , which are derived from the a@xmath1 modes in the polarized raman spectra and e and t@xmath2 modes from the depolarized raman spectra . as can be seen from figs",
    ". 1 - 3 and fig .",
    "6 , the intensities of the a@xmath1 , e , and t@xmath2 modes are of nearly the same magnitude for small dots , which indicates the mode mixing due to the quantum confinement of phonon modes in small qds .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the raman intensities of si qds with up to 11,489 atoms ( about 7.6 nm in diameter ) .",
    "the phonon modes are calculated directly from the lattice dynamic matrix of a microscopic vffm by employing the projection operators of the irreducible representations .",
    "based on the results of phonon modes , the raman intensities are calculated by using a bpa .",
    "the size effects of the raman intensity in qds are discussed in detail based on these calculations .",
    "our calculated results agree with the existing experimental observations , and we are expecting that our calculations will stimulate more experimental measurements of raman intensities of qds .",
