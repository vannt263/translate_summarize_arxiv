    "the pulsar population is an important tool to study various aspects of stellar evolution , supernova rates , birth properties of neutron stars and the evolution of massive binary systems .",
    "of particular interest are the double neutron star ( dns ) binary systems whose inspirals are one of the key events expected by the gravitational wave detectors now in operation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "dns binaries consist of an older neutron star with a short spin period ( typically in the range 20100 ms ) formed in the supernova explosion of the initially more massive star in the binary system ( the primary ) .",
    "the first - born neutron star initially behaves as a regular radio pulsar , but subsequently becomes spun up ( recycled ) via the accretion of matter during roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) from the secondary star once it leaves the main sequence . following the supernova explosion of the secondary",
    ", the resulting dns consists of a recycled pulsar and a younger second - born neutron star .    while a number of studies have addressed the population , lifetime and merger rate of dns binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , less attention has been given to those binary systems which disrupt during the second supernova ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "of particular significance are the statistics of the recycled pulsars released from these binary systems , with their distinct spin properties .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , these so - called ` disrupted recycled pulsars ' ( drps ) directly probe the fraction of dns binaries which do not survive the second supernova explosion and can therefore provide an independent constraint on population synthesis models which predict a certain fraction of drps relative to dns binaries .    as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", there is an apparent conundrum posed by the observed dns / drp statistics .",
    "given our current understanding of binary evolution , the ratio of the _ underlying _ number of dns systems to drps observed should equal the survival fraction for binary systems during the second supernova event , i.e.  those which remained bound after the explosion .",
    "@xcite estimated this fraction to be around 0.1 based on scale - factor analysis of dnss and drps and appeared to be in reasonable accord with theoretical estimates of the survival fraction taken from the literature @xcite . assuming that the luminosities and radio lifetimes of the recycled pulsars observable in dns binaries",
    "are identical to the drps , the above estimate implies that we should see roughly ten drps for every dns binary .",
    "however , this expectation is not confirmed in the observed sample discussed in section  [ sec : sample ] where there are comparable numbers of drps and dns binaries .    in light of these issues ,",
    "the relationship between dns binaries and drps is an interesting problem which we address in this paper using monte carlo simulations of binary populations and observational selection effects .",
    "the goal of this work is to understand the relationship between the observed and underlying ratios of dns binaries to drps .",
    "this can be summarized by the expression @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the observed ratio of dns binaries to drps , @xmath6 is the underlying ( intrinsic ) ratio and @xmath7 is a correction factor which takes account of observational selection effects . as we discuss in section  [ sec : sample ] , we find that @xmath8 . in sections [ sec : simulation ] and 4 ,",
    "we use state - of - the - art binary population synthesis models to explore the possible predicted ranges of @xmath9 .",
    "we investigate observational selection effects in radio pulsar surveys to evaluate @xmath7 in section [ sec : selfx ] . finally , in section [ sec : conclusions",

    "results of population synthesis calculations for the dns and drp populations . from left to right , the columns give the name of evolutionary model , natal kick velocity dispersion , intrinsic numbers of dns ( @xmath16 ) and drps ( @xmath17 ) , and the intrinsic ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the range of values corresponds to changing evolutionary assumption on common envelope evolution . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our results are summarized in table [ tab : simulations ] where we calculate the number of each model pulsar population detected ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and the ratio of the two populations @xmath21 .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath19 and @xmath22 are , of course , arbitrarily high and chosen to be so to minimize statistical fluctuations . given our assertion of that the spindown and beaming of the two populations should be identical , it is their ratio that is of astrophysical significance . as can be seen ,",
    "depending on the survey parameters , there is a variation in the ratio in the range 0.91.7 .",
    "surveys along the galactic plane ( i.e.  pmsurv and palfa ) show the largest bias in favor of detecting dns systems over drps ( i.e.  the largest values of @xmath7 ) , while surveys away from the plane ( e.g.  phsurv and pks70 ) show much less of a bias .",
    "indeed , for the swinburne high - latitude survey @xcite , the bias is slightly tipped in favor of detecting drps . taken as a whole",
    ", the average value of @xmath23 in table [ tab : simulations ] suggests that we might expect to detect around 25% more dns binaries than drps due to selection effects alone .",
    "thus the observational bias is a relatively small perturbation on top of the intrinsic ratios found in the population syntheses listed in table 2 .",
    "although we have only explicitly considered the velocity and orbital period distributions from model a in this study , similar results are found when the other model parameters are used as input . in summary , while we find that observational biases exist which favor the detection of dnss over drps , their magnitude is not sufficient to significantly skew any underlying ratios of the two populations .",
    "this allows us to revisit the results from the population syntheses presented in table 2 . as discussed",
    "earlier the observed ratio is @xmath8 .",
    "if we fold this with observational bias factor ( @xmath24 ) the intrinsic ratio of dns to drps is of the order @xmath25 ( drps slightly dominate over dns ) . the comparison with table 2 , that shows the predicted ratios @xmath9 , shows two things",
    "first , the model with natal kicks adopted from observations of single pulsars ( model a ) does not reproduce the intrinsic ratio ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "second , the models that are close to the intrinsic ratio ( model b and c , @xmath27 respectively ) indicate that the 1d dispersion of kick velocity distribution is of the order of @xmath28 km s@xmath2 ( approximately the mid point between model b and c ) .",
    "we have investigated the statistics of disrupted recycled pulsars ( drps ) and double neutron star ( dns ) binaries where it is observed ( see section 2 ) that there are comparable numbers of dns binary systems and drps . from a population synthesis of neutron star formation and evolution in binary systems ( see section 3 ) , regardless of the assumed natal kick velocity distribution for neutron stars , we find that the velocity dispersion of drps is significantly higher than for dns binaries . using the resulting orbital period and velocity distributions in a model for radio pulsar selection effects ( see section 4 ) , we found that there is a small ( @xmath0 ) observational bias in favor of detecting dns binaries over drps .",
    "the difference in velocity dispersions for the two populations lead to a bias towards observing dns binaries which are , on average , closer to the earth than drps .",
    "this conclusion holds even after taking into account that dns binaries are harder to detect due to doppler smearing .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that our models in which the natal kick velocity dispersion above 200  km  s@xmath2 ( e.g.  model a ) or below 100  km  s@xmath2 ( e.g.  model d ) are inconsistent with the observations .",
    "model a predicts significantly more drps than are observed , while model d predicts significantly more dns binaries than are observed .",
    "models with intermediate natal kicks ( e.g.  models b and c ) provide a better match to the observed sample .",
    "the typical kicks ( from regular ( feni ) core collapse supernovae ) that match the observed intrinsic ratio are of the order of @xmath28 km s@xmath2 . in all our simulations",
    "we have included the formation of neutron stars through electron - capture supernovae with no natal kicks .",
    "the initial mass formation range for electron - capture ns formation was adopted from hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and eldridge & tout ( 2004a , b ) for single stars ( @xmath29 ; see belczynski et al .",
    "2008 ) , and it is naturally extended by binary evolution . if the adopted range for electron - capture supernovae was much broader than adopted here , it would be possible to explain the the observed intrinsic ratio of dns to drps with much higher regular ( feni ) core - collapse supernova kicks .",
    "independent of details of the electron - capture ns formation , our results strongly indicate that ns natal kicks ( whether formed via regular core collapse or electron - capture ) are much lower in binaries than for single pulsar population .    the research into natal kicks and the formation of single recycled pulsars by supernova disruption has already a long history ( e.g. , bailes 1989 ) .",
    "the most recent study by dewi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is not directly comparable to our results .",
    "dewi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have studied only one ( alternative ) scenario of the dns formation and based their conclusions on the information available at the time of their study ( 7 dns and 2 drp ) .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the results from dewi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show slightly higher dns birth rates as compared to disruption rates ( drp formation ) for example for the model in which natal kicks are drawn from distribution with @xmath30 km s@xmath2 ( see the first entry in their table 1 ) .",
    "this result is fully consistent with the current observational dataset , presented here , and it is similar to our finding for the two models b and c that also match the observations .",
    "our conclusion that small neutron star kicks are required to explain the dns ",
    "drp populations adds to the growing body of evidence that such kicks are required in the formation of close binaries .",
    "the original impetus for this idea was provided by pfahl et al .",
    "( 2002a ) based on statistics of high - mass x - ray binaries with orbital periods longer than 30 days .",
    "a similar requirement was seen for the neutron star population in globular clusters ( pfahl et al .",
    "2002b ) in which the low escape velocities of the clusters predict many fewer pulsars than are observed ( drukier 1996 ) .",
    "the notion of electron - capture supernovae , which naturally produce such neutron stars with lower velocity kicks was subsequently introduced by podsiadlowski et al .",
    "more recent evidence for low - velocity kicks in binary systems has been inferred from the spin - eccentricity correlation seen in dns binaries ( faulkner et al .",
    "2005 ; dewi et al .",
    "2005 ) and in a starburst activity of high - mass x - ray binaries in the small magellanic cloud ( linden et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the process of the formation of neutron stars via electron capture supernovae is highly uncertain ; the magnitude of kicks ( if any ; e.g. , dessart et al .",
    "2006 ; kitaura et al .",
    "2006 ) , the initial star mass range for these explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or physical conditions like rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at which such a process may occur .",
    "we have included the possibility of formation of neutron stars via this process in our calculations and we have assumed that these types of explosions are not connected with any significant natal kicks . still , our results indicated that there are too many dns progenitor binary disruptions to reproduce the approximately equal observed numbers of dnss and drps .",
    "the disruptions are mostly due to the natal kicks received by neutron stars in regular ( feni ) core collapse supernovae .",
    "it naturally led us to conclude that the regular core collapse natal kicks are smaller than it is usually believed in the case of close binaries .",
    "however , it needs to be noted that a similar effect ( fewer disruptions ) may be achieved via extended formation of neutron stars via electron capture supernova with negligible ( or no ) kicks ( e.g. podsiadlowski et al .",
    "whether it is rather small regular core collapse kicks , or an excess of formation of neutron stars via electron capture supernovae or some other process , it seems to be clear that the kicks that operate in close interacting binaries ( like for progenitors of dns ) are significantly smaller than the ones inferred for the population of galactic single pulsars ( e.g. , hobbs et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that the supernova hydrodynamical simulations predict increase of asymmetries with rotation ( chris fryer , private communication ) .",
    "if natal kicks are connected to assymetries in regular ( feni ) core collapse then ns in binaries ( fast rotation ) are expected to receive larger kicks then single stars , opposite to what seems to be inferred from observations . on the other note",
    ", the kick mechanism may be totally different for an exploding @xmath31 h - rich star ( single ns progenitor ) and a @xmath32 he - rich star ( binary ) .",
