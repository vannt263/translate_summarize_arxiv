    "the @xmath1-wave superconducting state , besides the familiar rotational invariance , at low energies possesses an additional `` chiral '' symmetry for its quasiparticle excitations  @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown  @xcite that the quantum phase transition from the antiferromagnetic insulator to the @xmath1-wave superconductor may be understood in terms of this hidden symmetry : while present in the superconducting state , chiral symmetry is manifestly broken when the spin density wave ( sdw ) order develops .",
    "dynamical agent that brings about this change of symmetry was argued to be provided by the vortex fluctuations of the condensate , that can be represented by an effective gauge field minimally coupled to gapless quasiparticles of the @xmath1-wave state  @xcite ,  @xcite . that way the theory of phase fluctuating @xmath1-wave superconductor can be mapped onto the three dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( @xmath0 ) , which was proposed as an effective low - energy description of the underdoped high - temperature superconductors  @xcite .",
    "chiral symmetry , however , is not an exact symmetry of the @xmath1-wave superconducting state , but arises only in the low - energy limit of the standard quasiparticle action . at low energies one",
    "is allowed to linearize the spectrum near the nodes of the @xmath1-wave order parameter and neglect the higher order derivatives and the short - range interactions between quasiparticles , which are both linearly irrelevant by power counting . in this approximation",
    "the action becomes symmetric under a global @xmath2 transformation , where each @xmath3 factor acts onto a four - component dirac field that describes the gapless excitations near the pair of the diagonally opposed nodes @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ nodes ] ) .",
    "if one would also neglect the intrinsic velocity anisotropy of the @xmath1-wave superconductor @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the fermi velocity and @xmath6 the velocity related to the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter , the chiral symmetry group would be enlarged into the sixteen dimensional @xmath7 .",
    "the sdw insulator corresponds to breaking of this symmetry along one particular `` direction '' , while the broken generators of @xmath7 rotate it towards one of the other possible broken symmetry states . among these",
    ", one can discern three additional types of insulators , related to the sdw ( and to each other ) by chiral symmetry : the `` @xmath8 '' and `` @xmath9 '' insulating states , and the stripe - like one - dimensional charge density waves ( cdw ) , in the classification of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .    in the case of the maximal @xmath7 chiral symmetry , all the above insulating states , and their various combinations @xcite , are equally likely outcomes of the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this degeneracy is in reality removed by the symmetry breaking perturbations to the @xmath0 , most prominent of which have already been mentioned above .",
    "for example , it was shown in  @xcite that the short range repulsion between quasiparticles favors the sdw over the @xmath8 insulator , and , moreover , enhances the sdw order deeper in the insulating state . in this paper",
    "we study the effects of weak velocity anisotropy , higher order derivatives , and short - range repulsive interaction on the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in the @xmath0 theory of the phase fluctuating @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "all of these perturbations are irrelevant at low energies , and we show that their effects on the energies of various states with weakly broken chiral symmetry can be ordered according to their engineering dimensionality : velocity anisotropy , being only marginally irrelevant  @xcite ,  @xcite , provides then the dominant perturbation . weak repulsion and the second order derivatives are both equally ( linearly ) irrelevant , but to the first order it is only the repulsion that affects the energies of the insulating states .",
    "fine structure of the chiral manifold of insulators is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fine ] .",
    "our main conclusion is that , to the leading order , it is the sdw state that is selected by the weak perturbations to the @xmath0 .",
    "although in real systems none of the above perturbations is truly weak , we believe our result provides a useful qualitative guide .",
    "in particular , it agrees with the standard picture of underdoped cuprates , upon identification of the sdw insulator as being continuously connected with the mott insulating antiferromagnet near half filling .    in",
    "what follows we first briefly review the salient points of the @xmath0 theory of phase fluctuating @xmath1-wave superconductor , and set up the convenient notation in terms of the eight component dirac fields .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the lowest order splittings of the energies due to velocity anisotropy , short - range repulsion , and higher order derivative terms .",
    "we end with the summary and some concluding remarks on our results .",
    "we start with the finite temperature ( @xmath10 ) quantum mechanical action for the interacting @xmath1-wave quasiparticles , s = s _ + s_u , where s _ = & & k , with @xmath11 s denoting fermionic matsubara frequencies , and with @xmath12 as the standard @xmath1-wave gap .",
    "@xmath13 represents the short - range repulsion between electrons , s_u = u_0^dd^2 ( _ c_^(r,)c_(r , ) ) ^2 , with @xmath14 .",
    "shifting the momenta as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and rotating the coordinate frame as in fig .",
    "[ nodes ] , we define the eight - component dirac field @xmath17 where for each node @xmath16 , ^(q , _",

    "c_^(- k_i+q , _",

    "@xmath23 , and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 satisfying the clifford algebra @xmath26 .",
    "finally , @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "one may next expand @xmath29 around the nodes of the superconducting order parameter in powers of @xmath30 .",
    "it is convenient to define the following matrices : @xmath31 using the symmetry property of the @xmath1-wave gap and the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one finds : & & s _",

    "@xmath5 and @xmath39 are the two characteristic velocities of the linearized spectrum , in units of some fixed velocity @xmath40 , which we set to @xmath41 .",
    "the isotropic theory is recovered in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "we will discuss the form of the @xmath43 that represents the higher order derivative terms shortly .",
    "note that the matrices @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s are independent of @xmath46 .    in the rest of the paper we will consider the linear , isotropic , non - interacting @xmath47 to be the maximally symmetric action .",
    "it remains invariant under a global chiral rotation e^i_i=1 ^ 16 _ i j_i with the generators @xmath48 forming the @xmath7 algebra .",
    "the explicit form of the generators is given in  @xcite .",
    "the connection to the @xmath0 is finalized by coupling the gapless quasiparticles to the fluctuating vortex excitations , which upon a singular gauge transformation may be represented by an effective gauge field in @xmath47 , by @xmath49 .",
    "the charge of the gauge field is proportional to the vortex condensate  @xcite .",
    "such a gauge transformation also turns the @xmath1-wave quasiparticles into neutral spin-@xmath50 excitations . in the phase",
    "coherent , i.e. superconducting state , charge vanishes and the gauge field is effectively decoupled , leaving the sharp spinon ( or quasiparticle ) excitations behind .",
    "when the vortices condense , on the other hand , superconductivity is lost , and simultaneously the spinon `` mass '' term @xmath51 becomes dynamically generated  @xcite . here , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 representing the spinon self - energy due to the integraction with the gauge field .",
    "rewriting the mass term in terms of the electron operators one recognizes that it simply represents a two - dimensional sdw with the periodicity determined by the wave vectors @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the sdw order , therefore , corresponds to the particular form of the @xmath46 matrix we have chosen . by applying a unitary @xmath7 transformation on our @xmath46 one recovers all other insulating states that are related to the sdw by chiral symmetry . in particular , transforming @xmath46 as _ 0 e^i 4 j _ 0 e^-i 4 j with @xmath55 produces the @xmath8 insulator : the phase incoherent , translationally symmetric state with an additional p - wave pairing between spinons .",
    "similarly , @xmath56 $ ] yields the @xmath9 insulator , and @xmath57 gives the cdw with the periodicity set by the wavevector @xmath58 .",
    "of course , there is a continuum of other chiral rotations that are possible , and which lead to various linear combinations of the four fundamental states defined above .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we study how the degeneracy between the sdw , cdw , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 states as defined above is removed by the leading perturbations to @xmath47 : anisotropy , repulsion , and higher order derivatives .",
    "we set @xmath59 in @xmath60 to study first the effect of weak anisotropy @xmath61 on the energy of the degenerate ground states of the chiral symmetry broken , isotropic @xmath0",
    ". since the action @xmath62 is symmetric under the exchange @xmath63 , the energies of various states should be invariant under the same exchange .",
    "moreover , if @xmath64 , both velocities can be rescaled out of the problem by an appropriate choice of @xmath40 .",
    "the energy splittings between the states must therefore be proportional to @xmath65 , to the lowest order .",
    "indeed , defining the three dimensional volume as @xmath66 , the first order correction of the energies per volume due to the velocity anisotropy is e^(1)_a & = & 10s_1 = _",
    "i(b_i_i ) i_0 + & = & 8 m^3(_f+_)i_0 , + independently of the choice of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath67 is a positive , dimensionless integral i_0=13x , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the rescaled self energy .",
    "@xmath70 denotes the upper cut - off .",
    "@xmath71 therefore provides only an overall energy shift , same for all states .    to the second order",
    ", however , we find e^(2)_a = & & -12 ( 0s_1 ^ 2 - 0s_1 ^ 2 ) = -12 m^3_ij , [ de21 ] where i_ij & = & x , + i_ij , & = & x .",
    "since the rescaled self - energy @xmath72 in the @xmath0 falls off rapidly for @xmath73 @xcite , we will set @xmath74 in @xmath75 , and then approximate @xmath76 under the integral",
    ". this `` constant mass '' approximation seems not to be appropriate for the integral @xmath77 , which is without @xmath78 in the numerator of the integrand .",
    "luckily , however , @xmath79 is independent of the choice of @xmath46 and therefore , the term with @xmath77 does not contribute to the energy differences , but only to the overall shift of the energies .",
    "this will be the generic situation in all further calculations .",
    "we will then take @xmath74 and @xmath80 in all the integrals hereafter .",
    "the lowest ( second ) order effect of the velocity anisotropy is to increase the energy of the cdw relative to the sdw , d+ip and d+is , which remain degenerate : & & e_a ,-",
    "e_a,=4 m^3(v_f - v_)^2i>0 , + & & i=13 1x = .",
    "the energy splitting vanishes when @xmath42 , as expected .",
    "the fact that @xmath8 and @xmath9 insulators have the same energy in presence of velocity anisotropy can be shown to be generally true to any order of the perturbation theory . to see this , note that @xmath8 and @xmath9 states are represented by @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively . when written in the @xmath83 from , the only difference between the two is in the signs of some terms , which always may be changed by a unitary transformation .",
    "put differently , the choice of @xmath46 enters the energy calculation only through the combination @xmath84 .",
    "matrices @xmath85 , on the other hand , have to appear in even numbers in our calculation , as in eq .",
    "( [ de21 ] ) , otherwise the accompanying integrals will be odd in some momentum component and vanish . since @xmath44 s are block - diagonal , the sign of the block - diagonal elements in @xmath85 s , then , can not matter : @xmath8 and @xmath9 states remain degenerate to all orders in weak anisotropy .",
    "we now set @xmath86 to work out the first finite energy contribution of the short - range repulsion @xmath13 to the degenerate ground states of the isotropic action .",
    "it is found that & & e^(1)_u = 10s_u = m^4uj^2[((b_u))^2 -(b_u^2 ) ] , [ de1u ] + & & j=1x 11+x^2 = . the first term in eq .",

    "it seems , then , that we need to specify the dispersion relation and the gap function to determine the effect of the higher - order derivative terms on the energies of the degenerate ground states .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that up to the the first non - vanishing ( second ) order of perturbation , the qualitative effect of these terms is to raise the energy of the sdw , lower that of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and keep the energy of the cdw unchanged , independently of the functional form of the dispersion and the gap function .    for definiteness",
