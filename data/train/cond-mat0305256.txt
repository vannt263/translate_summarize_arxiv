    "abrikosov flux lines ( vortices ) created by magnetic field in type ii superconductors strongly interact with each other creating highly correlated configurations like the vortex lattice . in high @xmath2 cuprates thermal fluctuations at relatively large temperatures",
    "are strong enough to melt the lattice .",
    "several remarkable experiments demonstrated that the vortex lattice melting in high @xmath2 superconductors is first order with magnetization jumps @xcite and spikes in specific heat @xcite .",
    "magnetization and entropy jumps were measured using local hall probes zeldov , squid @xcite , torque magnetometry willemin , nishizaki and integrating the specific heat spike schilling , bouquet .",
    "it was found that in addition to the spike there is also a jump in specific heat in @xmath7 which was measured as well schilling , bouquet , roulin .",
    "these precise measurements pose a question of accurate quantitative theoretical description of thermal fluctuations in vortex matter .",
    "the melting line in high @xmath2 cuprates has been studied mainly not very far from @xmath8 in this part of the phase diagram the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) approach is generally appropriate to describe thermal fluctuations near @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the gl model is however highly nontrivial even within the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation valid at relatively high fields .",
    "this simplified model has only one parameter : the dimensionless lll scaled temperature @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( defined precisely in eq.([athl ] ) below ) . over  the last twenty years great variety of theoretical methods",
    "were applied to study this model .",
    "brezin , nelson and thiaville @xcite applied the renormalization group ( rg ) method on the one loop level description of the vortex liquid .",
    "no nontrivial fixed points of the ( functional ) rg equations were found and they concluded therefore that the transition from liquid to the solid is first order @xcite .",
    "another often used approach applicable also beyond the range of validity of gl model is to use elasticity theory description of the vortex lattice and lindermann criterion to determine the location of melting line @xcite .",
    "however all those approaches do not provide a quantitative theory of melting since these are one phase theories and in order , for example , to calculate discontinuities at first order transition accurate description of both phases is necessary ..    two perturbative approaches were developed and greatly improved recently to describe both the solid and the liquid phases in the lll gl model .",
    "the perturbative approach on the liquid side was pioneered long ago by thouless and ruggeri @xcite .",
    "they developed a perturbative expansion around a homogeneous ( liquid ) state in which all the  bubble   diagrams are resumed .",
    "unfortunately they found that the series are asymptotic and although first few terms provide accurate results at very high temperatures , the series become inapplicable for @xmath9 less than @xmath12 , which is quite far above the melting line ( believed to be located around @xmath13 ) .",
    "we recently obtained the optimized gaussian series @xcite which are convergent rather than asymptotic with radius of convergence of @xmath14 still unfortunately above the melting point .    on the solid side ,",
    "long time ago eilenberger and maki and takayama eilenberger calculated the fluctuations spectrum around abrikosov s mean field solution .",
    "they noticed that the vortex lattice phonon modes are softer than that of the acoustic phonons in atomic crystals and this leads to infrared ( ir ) divergences in certain quantities .",
    "this was initially interpreted as  destruction of the vortex solid by thermal fluctuationsand the perturbation theory was abandoned .",
    "however the divergences look suspiciously similar to  spurious ",
    "ir divergences in the critical phenomena theory and recently it was shown that all these ir divergences cancel in physical quantities @xcite .",
    "the series therefore are reliable , and were extended to two loops , so that the lll gl theory on the solid side is now precise enough even around melting point .",
    "therefore the missing part is a theory in the region @xmath15 on the liquid side .",
    "moreover this theory should be very precise since free energies of solid and liquid happen to differ only by few percents around melting .",
    "closely related to melting is the problem of nature of the metastable phases of the theory . while it is clear that the overheated solid becomes unstable at some finite temperature , it not generally clear whether the overcooled liquid becomes unstable at some finite temperature ( like water and other molecular liquids , which however has a crucial attractive component of the intermolecular force ) or exists all the way down to @xmath16 as a metastable state .",
    "the gaussian ( hartree - fock ) variational calculation , although perhaps of a limited precision , is usually a very good guide as far as qualitative features of the phase diagram are concerned .",
    "such a calculation in the liquid was performed long ago @xcite , while a significantly more complicated one sampling also inhomogeneous states ( vortex lattice ) was obtained recently @xcite .",
    "the gaussian results are as follows .",
    "the free energy of the solid state is lower than that of the liquid for all temperatures lower than melting temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the solid state is therefore the stable one below @xmath17 , becomes metastable at somewhat higher temperatures and is destabilized at @xmath14 .",
    "the liquid state becomes metastable below the melting temperature , but unlike the solid , does not loose metastability all the way down to @xmath18 ( @xmath16 ) . the excitation energy of the supercooled liquid approaches zero as a power @xmath19 .",
    "this general picture is supported in section iii by an exactly solvable large @xmath0 ginzburg - landau model of vortex matter in type ii superconductors .",
    "meantime in different area of physics similar qualitative results were obtained .",
    "it was shown by variety of analytical and numerical methods that liquid ( gas ) phase of the classical one component coulomb plasma exists as a metastable state down to very low temperature possibly @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the quantum one component plasma - electron gas also shows similar feature @xcite .",
    "one considers quantum fluctuations instead of the thermal ones ( an analog of inverse temperature is coupling @xmath20 , see section iii ) .",
    "it seems plausible to speculate that the same phenomenon would happen in any system of point like or line like objects interacting via purely repulsive forces .",
    "in fact the vortices in the london approximation are a sort of repelling lines with the force even more long range than coulombic .",
    "this was an additional strong motivation to consider the above scenario in vortex matter .",
    "in section iii we provide both theoretical and phenomenological evidence that the above scenario is the correct one .",
    "assuming absence of singularities on the liquid branch allows to develop an essentially precise theory of the lll gl model in vortex liquid ( even including supercooled liquid ) using methods of theory of critical phenomena@xcite .",
    "the generally effective mathematical tool to approach a nontrivial fixed point ( in our case at zero temperature ) is the borel - pade ( bp ) transformation @xcite . before embarking on this program in following sections",
    ", we address several subtleties which prevented the use and acceptance of the bp method in the past and then combine it with the recently developed lll theory of solids to calculate the melting line and the magnetization and the specific heat jumps across the line .",
    "very early on ruggeri and thouless @xcite tried to use bp ( unfortunately a `` constrained '' one , so that it interpolates smoothly with the solid , assumption we believe is incorrect ) to calculate the specific heat without much success .",
    "it was shown by wilkin and moore @xcite that the constrained bp does not converge , while the results for unconstrained bp were inconclusive .",
    "they attributed this to the limited order of expansion known at that time .",
    "subsequent attempts to use bp for the calculation of the melting line using longer series also ran into problems .",
    "hikami , fujita and larkin @xcite tried to find the melting point by comparing the bp energy with the one loop solid energy and obtained @xmath21 .",
    "however their one loop solid energy was incorrect and , in any case , it was not precise enough ( as will become clear below the two loop contribution can not be neglected ) .",
    "the lll gl model was also studied numerically in both lawrence - doniah model ( a good approximation of the 3d gl for large number of layers ) sasik , hu and  in 2d @xcite and by a variety of nonperturbative analytical methods . among them",
    "the density functional @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , dislocation theory of melting @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "as we show in this paper , the bp liquid free energy combined with the correct two loop solid energy computed recently gives scaled melting temperature @xmath23 and in addition predicts other characteristics of the model .",
    "the magnetization of liquid is larger than that of solid by @xmath1 irrespective of the melting temperature ( the specific heat jump is about @xmath24 and decreases slowly with temperature in @xmath7 ) .",
    "brief account of these results was published @xcite .",
    "in addition to the theory of melting , we considered overcooled liquid and calculated magnetization and specific heat curves .",
    "since the metastable overcooled liquid state exists all the way down to zero temperature , we can define liquid madelung energy .",
    "looking at the melting process from the low temperature side for both the liquid and the solid we find that the madelung energy of liquid is larger than that of the solid approximately by the latent heat of melting .",
    "our magnetization curves agree quite well with monte carlo simulations of the lll gl @xcite , and almost perfectly for specific heat in 2d by kato and nagaosa in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition we consider in this paper several  phenomenological  issues , some matter of significant disagreement .",
    "first is the range of applicability of the lll model .",
    "we find that in order to describe experimental reversible magnetization of @xmath7 at lower fields , higher landau levels ( hll ) corrections should be incorporated .",
    "we therefore clarify in section v the role of the hll modes .",
    "experimentally it was claimed that one can establish the lll scaling for fields above @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "a glance at the data however shows that in normal state ( above @xmath2 ) the lll scaling for magnetization curves is generally very bad .",
    "most of the hll effects can be taken into account by just renormalizing parameters of the lll model .",
    "therefore one should use the  effective lll ",
    "in which hll were  integrated out  . to clarify this often salient feature",
    "we explicitly perform this integration within a self consistent approach in section v. it was noted by koshelev @xcite and others that , to calculate magnetization , one has to carefully account for renormalization of the free energy since it is field dependent .",
    "then we calculated the leading correction the effective lll and compared with experiments .",
    "it is found that although the lll contribution to magnetization is much larger that the experimentally observed one above @xmath2 , it is nearly cancelled by the hll contributions .",
    "this explains the breaking of the lll scaling in the normal state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is defined and its applicability range discussed in section ii . in section iii , supercooled liquid in general repulsive system will be discussed .",
    "we provide evidence for the scenarios outlined above using both a solvable ( for a large number of components ) ginzburg - landau model and analyzing numerical results in other systems . in section iv the lll model is solved and the melting theory of vortex lattice is presented and compared to experiments . in section",
    "v , the hll corrections are discussed and the magnetization curves are compared with experiments .",
    "phenomenological issues are addressed in sections iib ( assumptions ) , ivc ( melting line , ginzburg parameter fit for various materials ) , ivd ( magnetization , entropy jumps ) , i ve ( specific heat jumps ) and vd ( reversible magnetization curve ) , so readers not interested in theoretical details can directly proceed to these sections .",
    "on the mesoscopic scale a 3d superconducting materials with not very strong asymmetry along the @xmath26 axis are effectively described by the following ginzburg - landau free energy functional : @xmath27}=\\int d^{3}x\\frac{{\\hbar } ^{2}}{2m_{ab}}% \\left\\vert { \\bf d}\\psi \\right\\vert ^{2}+\\frac{{\\hbar } ^{2}}{2m_{c}}|\\partial _ { z}\\psi |^{2}-a(t)|\\psi |^{2}+\\frac{b^{\\prime } } { 2}|\\psi |^{4}+\\frac{\\left ( { \\bf b}-{\\bf h}\\right ) ^{2}}{8\\pi }   \\label{gldef}\\]]involving the order parameter field @xmath28 and magnetic field @xmath29 .",

    "the use of the above gl energy hinges upon several physical assumptions .",
    "they are listed below .",
    "\\(1 ) _ continuum 3d model _    we use the anisotropic gl model despite the well established layered structure of the high @xmath2 cuprates for which models of the lawrence - doniah type are more appropriate .",
    "effects of layered structure are dominant in @xmath37 or @xmath38 compounds ( anisotropy very large : @xmath39 ) and noticeable for cuprates with anisotropy of order @xmath40 like @xmath41 strongly underdoped @xmath7 ( see however shapiro ) or @xmath42 .",
    "the requirement , that the 3d gl can be effectively used , therefore limits us to optimally doped @xmath43 ( or slightly overdoped or underdoped ) for which the anisotropy parameter is not very large @xmath44 @xcite ) , @xmath4 and possibly @xmath45 which has a slightly larger anisotropy .",
    "there is no such problem in recently discovered isotropic fluctuatingsuperconductor @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) _ range of validity of the mesoscopic ( gl ) approach _    the gl approach generally is an effective mesoscopic approach .",
    "it is applicable when one can neglect higher order terms in the functional eq.(gldef ) typically generated , when one  integrates out ",
    "microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the leading higher dimensional terms we neglect ( as  irrelevant  ) are @xmath46 and higher ( four ) derivative terms like @xmath47 .",
    "this naively leads to a condition that @xmath48 is smaller than @xmath49 here and in what follows@xmath50the applicability line @xmath51 for @xmath7 is plotted in fig .",
    "1 . we also will consider a model invariant under rotations in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "noninvariant models sometimes can be rescaled it to @xmath53 @xcite@xmath54 for several physical questions those assumptions are not valid because neglected  irrelevant  terms might become  dangerous  .",
    "for example the question of the structural phase transition into the square lattice is clearly of this type @xcite . it is known that even assuming @xmath55 in low temperature vortex lattices in @xmath56 rotational symmetry is broken down to the fourfold symmetry by the four derivative terms .",
    "however there is no significant correction to , for example , the magnetization from those higher dimension terms .",
    "\\(3 ) _ expansion of parameters around _",
    "@xmath2    generally parameters of the gl model of eq.([gldef ] ) are complicated functions of temperature which are determined by the details of the microscopic theory .",
    "we expand the coefficient @xmath57 near @xmath58 @xmath59.\\]]the second and higher terms in the expansion are omitted and therefore , when temperature deviates significantly from @xmath60 one can not expect the model to have a good precision .",

    "inhomogeneity is of order @xmath65 .",
    "since the main subject of this study is thermal fluctuation effects of the order parameter field , one might ask whether thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field should be also taken into account .",
    "halperin , lubensky and ma considered this question long time ago @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that they are completely negligible for very large @xmath66 upon discovery of the high @xmath2 cuprates , the issue was reconsidered @xcite and the same result was obtained to a very high precision .",
    "therefore here magnetic field is treated both as constant and nonfluctuating ( @xmath67 ) and the last term in eq.([gldef ] ) can be omitted ( to precision of order @xmath68 ) .",
