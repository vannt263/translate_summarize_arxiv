    "the theory of the energy levels for few electrons systems , which is based on bound - state qed , has an exceptional predictive power that can be systematically improved due to the perturbative nature of the theory itself  @xcite . on the other side , laser spectroscopy yields spacing between energy levels in these atomic systems so precisely , that even tiny effects related with the nuclear structure already influence several significant digits of these measurements .",
    "thus , highly accurate atomic transition frequency measurements can be used as precise and clean probes ( purely electromagnetic interaction ) of low energy - qcd properties of the nucleus due to the low energy nature of the photons articulating the interaction between the nucleus and the orbiting particle .    a particular class of atoms , called muonic atoms , offer an interesting opportunity to extract properties of the nucleus with high accuracy .",
    "in these atoms , one or more electrons are substituted by a muon , which is a fundamental particle having the same electromagnetic properties as the electron but with a much larger mass ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example muonic hydrogen ( @xmath1 ) is the bound system of a negative muon and a proton , muonic helium ion ( @xmath2he@xmath3 ) a muon bound to an alpha particle .",
    "the atomic properties are strongly affected by the orbiting particle mass @xmath4 , e.g. , the bohr energy scales linearly with @xmath4 while the bohr radius as @xmath5 , resulting already for low - z atoms in muonic binding energies of several kev and in a so strong overlap of the muon wave functions with the nucleus that the energy levels are considerably ( % -level ) affected by the nucleus finite size .",
    "a paradigmatic example is @xmath2p whose laser spectroscopy yielded a very precise determination of the proton charge radius  @xcite .",
    "the scattering process between charged particles without internal structure , as for example electron - electron scattering can be fully described within qed .",
    "oppositely , when describing electron - proton scattering , form factors need to be introduced to parameterize the complexity of the nuclear structure .",
    "they contain dynamical information on the electric and magnetic currents in the nucleus defining the response to the electromagnetic fields . as a consequence of current conservation and relativistic invariance , for the spin-1/2 nuclei , as protons , only two form factors are required .",
    "experimentally these form factors can be accessed through measurements of the elastic differential cross section which in the one - photon approximation is  @xcite @xmath6 where the mott cross section applies for point - like particles and is fully calculated in the qed framework . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electric and magnetic sachs form factors , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are kinematical variables with @xmath11 being the electron scattering angle and @xmath12 the nucleus mass . at @xmath13",
    "the form factors correspond to the total charge in units of @xmath14 and magnetic moment in units of the proton magneton : for the proton @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "so in first approximation at low momentum exchange the response of the nucleus to electromagnetic fields is ruled by its charge and magnetic moment .    viewed as a taylor series",
    "the charge and the magnetic moment are the first terms in an infinite list of parameters which describes the interaction of the proton with the electromagnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the next parameters would be the slopes of the electric and magnetic form factors at zero momentum exchange : @xmath17 these equations represent the covariant definition of charge and magnetic radii , which in a non - relativistic approximation correspond to the second moments of the electric charge and magnetization distributions @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the nucleus @xmath20 any hadron / nuclear theory must reproduce these radii being parameters as fundamental as the charge , mass and magnetic moment .",
    "although lattice qcd shows an impressive progress  @xcite , currently these radii can not be accurately predicted from ab - initio theories and their knowledge relies on experiments  @xcite .    the traditional way to extract the form factors from the measured differential cross sections is based on the rosenbluth separation techniques which consist in plotting the reduced cross section @xmath21 versus @xmath22 : @xmath23 the reduced cross section is linear in @xmath22 , with the slope proportional to @xmath24 and the intercept equal to @xmath25 .",
    "so both form factors can be deduced by measuring @xmath26 at several values of @xmath22 which is achieved by varying the electron beam energy and the electron scattering angle while keeping @xmath27 fixed .    after this @xmath28 separation ,",
    "each measured form factor can be fitted with a polynomial expansion of the form  @xcite @xmath29 \\ ; , \\label{eq : taylor}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 represent the @xmath31-th moments of the charge / magnetic distributions ( @xmath32 ) . at very low @xmath27",
    ", one could hope that the higher moments terms are sufficiently small , such that the @xmath33-term can be determined without using a specific model for the form factor .",
    "however , at low @xmath27 also the @xmath33-term becomes increasingly small relative to the first term of the expansion resulting in a loss of sensitivity .",
    "so in practice to fit the measured form factors and extract the radii it is necessary to include data at intermediate @xmath27 . as cross sections data are available only down to a minimal @xmath27 , and because an extrapolation to @xmath13 is required , the choice of the fit function ( form factor model ) is very important .",
    "this extrapolation is even more challenging for the magnetic radii because of the @xmath34-dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mott ] ) which results in an additional suppression of sensitivity ( at low @xmath27 ) of the measured cross sections to @xmath35 compared to @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the increased uncertainties of @xmath35 at low @xmath27 yields magnetic radii with larger uncertainties relative to charge radii .",
    "this calls for alternative determinations of the magnetic radii such as from polarized - recoil scattering  @xcite or atomic spectroscopy .",
    "the finite radius of the nucleus implies that its charge is smeared over a finite volume . for hydrogen - like s - states",
    "there is a non - negligible probability that the `` orbiting '' particle is spending some time inside the nuclear charge distribution , thus experiencing a reduced electrostatic attraction as compared to a point - like nucleus .",
    "this reduced attraction caused by the modification of the coulomb potential for very small distances is giving rise to a shift of the atomic energy levels which for s - states h - like systems in leading order reads  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the wave function at the origin in coordinate space , @xmath39 the reduced mass of the atomic system with @xmath4 being the orbiting particle mass , and @xmath12 the nucleus mass , @xmath40 the fine structure constant , @xmath41 the charge number of the nucleus and @xmath42 the principal quantum number .    the @xmath43 dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : finite - size ] ) reveals the advantages related with muonic atoms .",
    "as the muon mass is 200 times larger than the electron mass , the muonic wave function strongly overlaps with the nucleus ensuing a large shift of the energy levels due to the nuclear finite size .",
    "thus , the muonic bound - states represent ideal systems for the precise determination of nuclear charge radii @xmath44  @xcite .    because of this sensitivity to the finite size a moderate ( 20 ppm ) accuracy in the measurement of the 2s-2p transition in @xmath2p is sufficient to extract the proton charge radius very accurately ( @xmath45 relative accuracy )  @xcite . in regular h ,",
    "the accuracies of the transition frequency measurements , also relative to the line - widths , have to be much higher ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) to compete with this value . by combining in a least - square adjustment all high - precision frequency measurements in h available to date , as accomplished by the codata group , a proton charge radius with an accuracy of about 1% is obtained .",
    "atomic spectroscopy can be used also to extract magnetic radii .",
    "this is achieved through precision measurement of hyperfine splittings  @xcite . for h - like systems , in leading approximation",
    "the hfs is given by the magnetic interaction between the nucleus @xmath46 and the orbiting particle @xmath47 magnetic moments , described by  @xcite @xmath48 which results in an energy splitting of the 1s state given by the fermi energy @xmath49 the finite size correction to this splitting , which is of second order in perturbation theory , is  @xcite @xmath50 where the zemach radius @xmath51 is defined as an integral of the charge and magnetic form factors @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 the proton anomalous magnetic moment ) . in a non - relativistic approximation @xmath54 can be expressed , by the first moment of the convolution between charge and magnetic distributions @xmath55 and @xmath56 in coordinate space @xmath57 when assuming form factor models or using measured form factor data , the magnetic radius can be extracted from the zemach radius .",
    "thus , accurate measurements of the hfs in @xmath2p and h can be used as complementary ways to obtain a precise value of the proton magnetic radius , or alternatively , as presented in  @xcite a self - consistent value of @xmath58 .",
    "three complementary routes to the proton charge radius have been undertaken : the historical method relies on elastic electron - proton scattering , the second one on high - precision laser spectroscopy in h , and the third one on high sensitivity laser spectroscopy in @xmath2p .",
    "the value extracted from @xmath2p  @xcite with a relative accuracy of @xmath45 is an order of magnitude more accurate than obtained from the other methods . yet",
    "the value is 4% smaller than derived from electron - proton scattering  @xcite and h spectroscopy  @xcite with a disagreement at the @xmath59 level .",
    "the most recent evaluations of the proton charge radius are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : radii ] .",
    "the most precise values are extracted from two transition frequency measurements in @xmath2p . by combining them",
    "we obtained a 2s-2p@xmath60 splitting of @xmath61 equivalent to a frequency of 48932.99(55 )  ghz , limited by statistics while the systematic effects are at the 300  mhz level  @xcite .",
    "equating this experimental value with the theoretical prediction @xmath62}-5.2275(10)~\\mathrm { \\big[\\frac{mev}{fm^2}\\big ] } r_e^2 + 0.0332(20)~\\mathrm{[mev ] } \\label{eq : lamb - shift - mup}\\ ] ] yields the proton charge radius @xmath44 in fm .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamb - shift - mup ] ) accounts for qed contributions , the second one for finite size effects , and the third one for the two - photon exchange ( tpe ) contribution which is a second - order perturbation theory contribution related with the proton structure . in the last years as summarized in  @xcite various cross checks and refinements of bound - state qed and tpe calculations needed for the extraction of @xmath44 from @xmath2p have been performed , but no substantial missing effects have been found that could explain the discrepancy .",
    "the typical systematics affecting the atomic energy levels are substantially suppressed in @xmath2p due to the stronger binding .",
    "the internal fields and the level separation of the muonic atoms are greatly enhanced compared to regular atoms making them insensitive to external fields ( ac and dc stark , zeeman , black - body and pressure shifts ) .",
    "thus @xmath2p turns out to be very sensitive to the proton charge radius ( @xmath43-dependence ) and insensitive to systematics which typically scale as @xmath63 .",
    "special attention was devoted to the analysis of electron - proton scattering data and the issues related with the extrapolation procedure .",
    "starting from fit functions given by truncated general series expansions such as taylor , splines and polynomials a large progress has been achieved in the last years by the use of various techniques : enforcing analyticity  @xcite , constraining the low @xmath27 behavior of the form factor assuming a large-@xmath64 behavior of the charge distribution  @xcite or by using proton models  @xcite .",
    "tension exists between various electron - proton data analysis : some give results compatible with @xmath2p  @xcite , some at variance  @xcite . because data at even lower @xmath27 would facilitate the extrapolation at @xmath13 , two electron - proton experiments have been initiated , one at jlab  @xcite , the other one at mami mainz  @xcite .",
    "a comparison between muon - proton and electron - proton scattering within the same setup as proposed by the muse  @xcite collaboration at psi could disclose a possible violation of muon - electron universality .",
    "several `` beyond standard model '' bsm extensions have been studied but the majority of them have difficulties to resolve the discrepancy without conflicting with other low energy constraints . still some bsm theories can be formulated but they require fine - tuning ( e.g. cancellation between axial and vector components ) , targeted coupling ( e.g. preferentially to muons ) and are problematic to be merged in a gauge invariant way into the standard model  @xcite",
    ". breakdown of the perturbative approach in the electron - proton interaction at short distances , as well as the interaction with sea @xmath65 and @xmath66 pairs and unusual proton structure have been suggested as possible explanation but without conclusive quantification  @xcite .",
    "summarizing , currently the discrepancy persists even though recent reanalysis of scattering data have led to larger uncertainties of the extracted proton radius .",
    "new data from muonic deuterium and helium , from h spectroscopy and electron - proton scattering holds the potential to clarify the situation in the near future .",
    "in a simplified way , the hydrogen s - state energy levels can be described by @xmath67 where @xmath68  hz is the rydberg constant and    @xmath69 } + 1.5645~\\mathrm{\\big[\\frac{mhz}{fm^2}\\big ] } r_e^2\\ ; \\label{eq : lamb - shift - h}\\ ] ]    the 1s lamb shift given by bound - state qed contributions . the different @xmath42-dependence of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) permits to extract both @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( thus @xmath44 ) from at least two frequency measurements in h.    being the most precisely known transition ( relative accuracy of @xmath72 )  @xcite and having the largest sensitivity to @xmath44 , usually the 1s-2s transition is used . by combining it with a second transition measurement ,",
    "@xmath70 is eliminated and @xmath44 can be extracted . when taken individually ,",
    "the various @xmath44 values extracted from h spectroscopy by combining two frequency measurements ( 2s-4s , 2s-12d , 2s-6s , 2s-6d , 2s-8s , 1s-3s as `` second '' transition  @xcite ) are statistically compatible with the value from @xmath2p . only the value extracted by pairing the 1s-2s and the 2s-8d transitions is showing a @xmath73 deviation while all the others differ only by @xmath74 .",
    "so the @xmath75 discrepancy between the proton charge radius from @xmath2p and h spectroscopy emerges only after an averaging process ( mean square adjustments of all measured transitions ) of the various `` individual '' determinations and consequently is less startling than it looks at first glance . a small systematic effect common to the h measurements could be sufficient to explain the deviation between @xmath2p and h results .",
    "this fact becomes even more evident if we consider the frequency shifts ( absolute and normalized to the line - width ) necessary to match the @xmath44 values from @xmath2p and h , as summarized for selected transitions in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "[ tab:1 ]    obviously the discrepancy can not be solved by slightly tuning ( shifting ) the measured values of the 1s-2s transition in h and the 2s-2p transitions in @xmath2p because it would require displacements corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . expressing the required frequency shift relative to the line - width as in the last column allows to better recognize some aspects of the experimental challenges .",
    "for example a shift of only @xmath78 of the 2s-4p transition would be sufficient to explain the discrepancy .",
    "a control of the systematics which could distort and shift the line shape on this level of accuracy is far from being a trivial task .",
    "well investigated are the large line broadening owing to inhomogeneous light shifts which results in profiles with effective widths much larger than the natural line - widths  @xcite .",
    "another exemplary correction relevant in this context , named quantum interference , has been brought recently back to attention  @xcite , and has lead to various reevaluations of precision experiments .",
    "an atomic transition can be shifted by the presence of a neighboring line , and this energy shift @xmath79 , as a rule of thumb , amounts maximally to @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the energy difference between the two resonances and @xmath82 the transition line - width .",
    "thus , if a transition frequency is aimed with an absolute accuracy of @xmath83 , then the influence of the neighboring lines with @xmath84 has to be considered .",
    "the precise evaluation of these quantum interference effects are challenging because they require solving numerous differential equations describing the amplitude of the total excitation and detection processes from initial to final state distributions which depends on the details of the experimental setup",
    ".    generally speaking , transition frequencies involving states with large @xmath42 are more sensitive to systematic effects caused by external fields .",
    "emblematic is the @xmath85-dependence of the stark effect .",
    "motivated by the possibility that minor effects in h could be responsible for the discrepancy , various activities have been initiated in this field : at mpq garching the 2s-4p  @xcite and 1s-3s transitions are addressed , at lkb paris the 1s-3s  @xcite , and at the toronto university the 2s-2p  @xcite .",
    "the `` second '' ( beside the 1s-2s transition ) transition frequency measurement in h can be interpreted as a @xmath70 determination .",
    "optical spectroscopy of h - like ions between circular rydberg states where the nuclear size corrections are basically absent , the qed contributions small , and the line - widths narrow can be used as alternative determination of @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "another way to @xmath70 is through spectroscopy of muonium and positronium atoms which are purely leptonic systems where uncertainties related with the finite size are absent  @xcite .",
    "as a next step , we plan to prepare the measurement by means of laser spectroscopy of the ground state hyperfine splitting ( 1s - hfs ) in @xmath2p and @xmath86he@xmath3 with few ppm relative accuracy .",
    "similar activities in @xmath2p exist at riken - ral and j - parc  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction for the 1s - hfs in @xmath2p is approximately  @xcite @xmath87}-1.301\\,\\mathrm { \\big[\\frac{mev}{fm}\\big ] } r_z+ 0.064(21)~\\mathrm{[mev ] } \\ ; , \\label{eq : hfs - mup}\\ ] ] where the first term includes the fermi energy , qed corrections , hadronic vacuum polarization , recoil corrections and weak interactions .",
    "these contributions are known well enough .",
    "the second term is the finite size contribution , which is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "it contains also some higher order mixed radiative finite - size corrections .",
    "the third term is given by the proton polarizability contribution .    by comparing the theoretical prediction with the experiment",
    ", it will become possible to deduce @xmath54 with a relative accuracy better than @xmath88 provided that the polarizability contribution will be improved below 10% relative accuracy .",
    "this contribution can be computed using a dispersive approach and measured proton polarized structure function @xmath89 and @xmath90  @xcite or via chiral perturbation theories ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "an improvement of this contributions is conceivable in the near future due to the considerable advance in chpt @xcite and due to various ongoing measurements of the proton structure functions at jlab using polarized target and beams .",
    "for @xmath86he@xmath3 the situation is conceptually similar to @xmath2p .",
    "the theoretical predictions assumes the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hfs - mup ] ) but with different numerical values .",
    "the motivations for these experiments are several :    * * bound - state qed in h and understanding of the 21 cm line * + the uncertainty of @xmath54 presently limits , together with the polarizability contribution , the theoretical prediction of the 1s - hfs in h. therefore , the comparison between the experimental 1s - hfs value in h , which has a relative accuracy smaller than @xmath91 , with the theoretical predictions is limited by the uncertainty of the proton structure contributions .",
    "this situation can be improved by complementary measurements in @xmath2p opening the way for a test of the hfs in h at the @xmath92 level of accuracy . * * understanding of the proton structure * + practically , from the zemach radius the magnetic radius can be obtained by using form factor models or measured form factor data .",

    "a precise measurement of @xmath54 from @xmath2p and its comparison with correlative measurements from scattering experiments bears the potential to push the frontier of our understanding of the complex non - perturbative nature of the proton structure which has been deeply reviewed in the last 15 years especially due to polarization data and the development of theoretical tools such as chiral perturbation theory .",
