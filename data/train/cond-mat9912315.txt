    "the physics of magnetic superconductors is especially interesting because of the competition between magnetic order and superconductivity .",
    "important progress in the field started with the discovery of the magnetic superconductors @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc . where the rare earth ions , @xmath10 , are regularly distributed in the crystal lattice .",
    "after intensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigation it turned out that in many of these systems superconductivity ( with the critical temperature @xmath5 ) coexists with antiferromagnetic order ( with the critical temperature @xmath11 ) .",
    "one usually has @xmath12 .",
    "however , due to their antagonistic characters singlet superconductivity and simple ferromagnetic order can not coexist in bulk samples with realistic physical parameters as it was shown theoretically @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , under certain physical conditions ferromagnetic order is transformed into a spiral or domain - like structure in the presence of superconductivity , as it was observed in @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite , @xcite . at the same time",
    "the superconducting order parameter is suppressed even in the presence of the modified ferromagnetism in such a way that they may coexist in some limited temperature interval ( in @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) or even down to @xmath16 ( in @xmath15 ) depending on system parameters . for more details",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , the coexistence of superconductivity and nuclear magnetism was found experimentally in @xmath17 @xcite and explained theoretically @xcite in terms of a spiral or a domain - like structure .",
    "there is also evidence for the coexistence of ferromagnetism , which appears at @xmath18 @xmath19 , and superconductivity , which sets in at @xmath20 @xmath19 , in the layered perovskite superconductor rusr@xmath21gdcu@xmath21o@xmath22 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the specificity of this material is that the ferromagnetic ( @xmath23 ) order is present in ru - o planes while superconducting ( @xmath0 ) pairing dominates in cu - o planes .",
    "recently , various artificial multilayer @xmath24  systems were prepared in the form of bilayer or trilayer systems or superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic and superconducting films deposited on each other . in all of these artificial structures , for instance in @xmath25 @xcite , @xcite and @xmath26 multilayers @xcite , in @xmath27 trilayers @xcite , @xcite , in @xmath28 trilayers @xcite , superconductivity and ferromagnetism",
    "are spatially separated . in spite of this fact @xmath5",
    "is suppressed in these systems due to the combined paramagnetic and proximity effect in the normal metal .",
    "the theoretically predicted oscillation of @xmath5 @xcite as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic film in @xmath29 multilayers was observed in @xmath30 @xcite and in @xmath25 @xcite , @xcite superlattices , while in some artificial structures of @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite this effect was absent .",

    "conduction electrons penetrate the magnetic layers on much smaller distances than in the case of metals and are totally reflected at the @xmath37 boundary . additionally , the boundaries in @xmath4 systems are magnetically active and rotate spins of reflected electrons",
    ". the @xmath4 systems , with @xmath3 a ferromagnetic insulator , might be of practical interest .",
    "in contrast to ferromagnetic metals , where the proximity effect is pronounced , this effect is drastically reduced in ferromagnetic insulators ( semiconductors ) and the physics depends on fewer parameters .",
    "note , the ferromagnetic semiconductors are already realized in systems like @xmath38 , @xmath39 with the curie temperature @xmath40 @xmath19 and @xmath41 @xmath19 , respectively . in the magnetic semiconductor @xmath42 , which shows metamagnetic behavior , the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order are realized at @xmath43 @xmath19 and @xmath44 @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    "the critical temperature of the @xmath4 sandwich with singlet and triplet superconductors is calculated for various orientations of the magnetization in the @xmath3 films .",

    "this result might mean that instead of the assumed second - order phase transition a first - order phase transition takes place in some region of the @xmath242 phase diagram .",

    "for such values of @xmath244 there is significant anisotropy of @xmath5 in this system , i.e. @xmath245 as shown in @xmath156 .",
    "hence , the superconductor can be switched from its normal to its superconducting state or vice versa by changing the relative orientation of the magnetization in the magnetic layers .",
    "if , for instance , the exchange fields of a @xmath4 sandwich ( with a singlet superconductor ) are perpendicular to each other at a given temperature @xmath246 , which fulfills @xmath247 , the superconductor is in its superconducting state .",
    "rotation of one of the fields by ninety degrees to the parallel configuration then switches the superconductor to its normal state .",
    "this means that in the perpendicular configuration the state  1  is realized , while in the parallel one the state  0  is realized .",
    "depending on the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic insulator ( like for instance magnetic anisotropy ) it may happen that energy losses of such a switch are minimized if it operates between the perpendicular and the parallel configuration . by combining many such switches various logic circuits",
    "can be realized what will be analyzed elsewhere .",
    "there is another possibility of a realization of logic circuits .",
    "if one keeps , for instance , the temperature fixed , @xmath248 , in a cryotron - like device , which consists of several @xmath4 switches with fixed orientation of the exchange fields , @xmath206 , one can then reach that some switches pass to normal state while others stay in the superconducting state by changing the current in the control device .",
    "various designs based on these switches are possible ( imaginable ) , also by combining these two possibilities .",
    "note , triplet superconductivity is probably realized in the layered perovskite superconductor @xmath6 @xcite with @xmath249 @xmath19 , while the structure of the order parameter is still unknown . however , there is some evidence that the order parameter belongs to the @xmath250 irreducible representation of the @xmath251 group , i.e. @xmath252 , where the unit vectors @xmath253 lie in the @xmath254 plane and @xmath255 is perpendicular to it @xcite . in the analysis of @xmath4 systems with triplet superconductivity",

    "according to this result we expect that similar behavior will be realized in @xmath6 with the order parameter proposed above @xcite .",
    "the possibility of resolving its structure by using @xmath4 systems will be analyzed elsewhere .    in conclusion",
    ", the @xmath4 switches and logic circuits would be advantageous compared to @xmath36 devices , because in the former fewer physical parameters need to be controlled than in the latter .",
