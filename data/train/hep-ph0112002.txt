    "present evidence for neutrino masses and mixings can be summarized as : 1 ) the atmospheric @xmath4ev@xmath5 is associated with a mixing , @xmath6 , near to maximal @xcite ; 2 ) the solar @xmath7 prefers the lma - msw solution @xcite ; chooz reactor data @xcite give severe limits for @xmath8 . in this contribution we are going to discuss that contrary to a wide spread belief , earth effects on the propagation of atmospheric neutrinos can become observable @xcite even if @xmath8 is small , but non - vanishing .",
    "this fact would allow to determine the sign of @xmath9 @xcite . for baselines",
    "@xmath10 smaller than the earth diameter , appropiate for atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath11 , so that we will neglect the ( 1,2)-oscillating phase in vacuum against the ( 2,3)-one .",
    "this is a very good aproximation , unless the high @xmath7-region of the lma solution turns out to be the solution to the solar problem . in that case",
    "we should take into account corrections of order @xmath12 ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the correspondence between the determination of the sign of @xmath9 and the observation of the earth effects in a transition involving @xmath13 .",
    "the change expected in the neutrino spectrum and mixing due to matter effects , both for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are pointed out . in the latter case ,",
    "section 3 studies the observability of the msw - resonance , with a positive conclusion for baselines @xmath16 7000 km .",
    "its impact on the survival probability , @xmath17 , is pointed out .",
    "section 4 gives an analysis of the matter - induced cpt - odd asymmetry , together with the realistic charge - asymmetry expected for atmospheric neutrinos . in section 5",
    "we present some conclusions .",
    "current analyses leave us with two alternatives for the spectrum of the three active neutrino species , either hierarchical or degenerate .",
    "the effective neutrino potential due to the charged current interaction of @xmath13 with the electrons in the medium is @xcite @xmath18 , so that the effective hamiltonian , in the extreme relativistic limit , is given by @xcite    @xmath19    in going from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , there are matter - induced cp- and cpt- odd effects associated with the change @xmath22 .",
    "the additional change u @xmath23 u@xmath24 is inoperative in the limit of ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the effects we are going to discuss depend on the interference between the different flavors and on the relative sign between @xmath25 and @xmath3 . as a consequence , an experimental distinction between the propagation of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( the sign of @xmath25 ) will determine the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "an appreciable interference will be present if and only if there are appreciable matter effects . for atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", one needs the `` connecting '' mixing @xmath26 between the @xmath13-flavor and the @xmath27 mass eigenstate to show up .    for @xmath28 ,",
    "matter effects lead to a breaking of the ( 1,2)-degeneracy such that @xmath29 coincides with @xmath13 .",
    "the net effect is that @xmath30 and @xmath31 in matter remain unaltered , i. e. , as for vacuum ( 2,3 ) , leading to the @xmath32 indicated by sk .",
    "the @xmath13-flavor decouples in matter , even if there was a large mixing in the ( 1,2)-system , as shown by the solar experiments .",
    "no matter effects would then be expected when starting with @xmath0 .",
    "the chooz limit @xcite , @xmath33 , is it then fatal ?    for small @xmath34 ,",
    "even if the effects on the spectrum are expected to be small , there could be a substantial mixing of @xmath13 with @xmath31 if one is near to a situation of level - crossing .",
    "this would lead to a resonant msw behaviour @xcite .",
    "@xmath35    but still @xmath36 , i.  e. , the @xmath13 has no overlap with the lowest mass eigenstate in matter .",
    "this vanishing mixing in matter is responsible for the absence of fundamental cp - violating effects , even if there are three non - degenerate mass eigenstates in matter . in vacuum ,",
    "the absence of genuine cp - odd probabilities was due to the degeneracy @xmath37 .",
    "the step from vanishing @xmath38 in vacuum to the vanishing mixing @xmath39 in matter was termed a `` transmutation '' @xcite .    for matter of constant density , there is no asymmetry associated with time - reversal t , contrary to the matter - induced cp- and cpt- odd asymmetries . as a consequence ,",
    "the t - conjugated transitions ( @xmath40 ) have equal appearance probabilities @xcite , @xmath41 .",
    "non - resonant important matter effects are induced in the non - leading appearance channel governed by @xmath42 . the corresponding probability for @xmath43 is given by @xcite    @xmath44}\\ ] ]    this probability has a good sensitivity to @xmath34 .",
    "besides the change in the effective mixing , the interference pattern is modified to an oscillating phase , @xmath45 , which contains a baseline dependence as a combination of the standard @xmath46 , plus the ( constant ) @xmath47 terms @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the aharonov - bohm effect , able to see the potential in quantum - mechanical phases .    for a baseline of @xmath10 = 3000 km ,",
    "appropiate for neutrino factories @xcite , there are non - resonant earth - matter effects in the sub - leading appearance probability . at the resonant energy",
    "@xmath48 9.6 gev , there is no observable trace of the resonance .",
    "this suppresion can be understood because a resonant mixing is associated with level - crossing , so that @xmath49 is minimum on the resonance and then , @xmath50 for such @xmath10 .",
    "appearance ( upper panel ) and survival ( lower panel ) probabilities , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for neutrinos ( solid line ) , antineutrinos ( dashed line ) and vacuum ( dotted line ) , for @xmath53 km , @xmath54 ev@xmath5 , @xmath55 and @xmath56.,width=377 ]    for atmospheric @xmath0 neutrinos , matter effects in the survival probability @xmath57 would be minute unless the resonance shows up .",
    "the resonance was not apparent even at @xmath10 = 3000 km .",
    "is there a way out ?",
    "again , a non - vanishing connecting mixing @xmath15 provides the solution .",
    "along with it , there is a resonance width which , when discussed in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath58 , is given by    @xmath59    one discovers that the oscillating phase on the resonance is non - vanishing , but given by the @xmath10-dependent relation    @xmath60    if @xmath61 , with optimal @xmath10 , @xmath62 , defined by @xmath63 , the resonance does not affect the oscillation probability . on the contrary , around @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , the resonance becomes apparent and @xmath62 is independent of @xmath9 , which determines the resonant energy . for @xmath66 , the maximum mixing is accompanied by maximum oscillating factor .    under these conditions , all channels would see the resonant effect .",
    "contrary to non - resonant matter effects , the resonance only affects the ( anti)neutrino channels if @xmath67 . for a baseline @xmath10 = 8000 km ,",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "lower panel : charge - asymmetry , a , for @xmath71 = 0.05 ( dashed line ) and 0.16 ( solid line ) .",
    "the lower plots correspond to @xmath72 and the upper ones to @xmath74 .",

    "as discussed in section 3 , matter effects distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos .",

    ", there is no room for genuine cp violation .",
    "the interaction with matter will generate an asymmetry effect , however , which is not connected with the vacuum propagation .    for @xmath0 and @xmath78 , one has    @xmath79    and it is represented in fig . [ asym ] as function of the energy for a baseline of @xmath53 km and different values of @xmath80 . around the resonance",
    ", @xmath69 presents a plateau with non - vanishing appreciable values ( depending on @xmath80 ) .",
    "the big asymmetries at 6 and 20 gev correspond to low probabilities and they are not of interest . the negative ( positive ) asymmetry in the plateau is obtained for @xmath67 .",
    "obviously , it is symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis when changing the sign of @xmath9 . as we have seen above , the optimal baseline is inversely proportional to the @xmath2 mixing .    for atmospheric neutrinos ,",
    "@xmath69 can not be separated out and the @xmath81 flux also contributes to the detection of @xmath82 .",

    "contrary to @xmath69 , the value of the muon - charge asymmetry is not symmetric with respect to the abscisa axis when changing the sign of @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ asym ] we give the values of a for two values of @xmath80 .",
    "there is again an appreciable separation between the cases of positive and negative @xmath9 .",
    "in the limit of @xmath90 , the main conclusions of this study are : i ) the medium effects , which discriminate between neutrino and antineutrino propagation determine the sign of the atmospheric @xmath3 ; ii ) for @xmath28 , electron neutrinos decouple from neutrino mixing in matter and have a definite effective mass in matter ; iii ) for @xmath91 , electron neutrinos mix with the third mass eigenstate neutrino and take part in the atmospheric neutrino oscillations ; iv ) electron neutrinos do not mix with the first mass eigenstate in matter , avoiding the generation of genuine cp - violating effects ; v ) non - resonant medium effects are already apparent in the sub - sominant channel @xmath68 for baselines @xmath92 km , in both the mixing and the oscillation phase - shift ; vi ) the observation of matter effects in the @xmath0-survival probability requires the action of the msw resonance , with baselines longer than @xmath93 km ; vii ) the optimal baseline depends on the value os @xmath34 , but the effects are much cleaner in the region of the longest baselines without entering the earth core @xcite ( nadir angles @xmath94 ) .",
