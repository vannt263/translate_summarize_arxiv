    "the nature of the last two sources ( 37.9 + 23.7 and 39.5 + 17.7 ) for which we have spectral index information are still a matter of discussion .",
    "it seems realistic that they emit a mixture of thermal and non - thermal radiation , and may manifest the most powerful regions ever observed .",
    "however , the burst of star formation in ngc 2146 has an extraordinary power , stronger than that in m82 . despite this and the fact that the overall radio spectral index of the galaxy",
    "reveals a non - thermal origin , the number of discovered snrs is much smaller than that in m82 . for the explanation of this fact we propose two scenarios :    * ngc 2146 is experiencing a burst of star formation stronger than that in m82 , but which we are observing in a younger phase",
    "this phase still lacks a large number of snrs , but instead gives rise to strong thermal emission from optically thick dense ionized gas regions , associated with massive or super starclusters .",
    "the origin of the non - thermal extended component must be a trace of past sn explosions , individually too old and faint to be seen , and belonging to a previous burst in the galaxy . * strong free - free absorption by very dense regions and , for the most compact sources , possibly also + synchrotron - self absorption , may conceal a certain number of snrs or rsn , rendering the identification of their nature difficult if only based on measurements of the spectral indices around the turnover frequencies . in this case",
    "the global number of snrs or rsn can be higher , and this would corroborate the similarity between ngc 2146 and m82 .",
