    "for 3-dimensional patches as used for solid modeling , injectivity is equivalent to the patch properly parameterizing the given solid .",

    "we show that regular control polytopes are the limits of patches as the weights undergo a toric deformation corresponding to the underlying regular triangulation , and that non - regular control polytopes can never be such a limit .",
    "this gives a precise meaning to the notion that the shape of the control net governs the shape of the patch .",
    "this line of inquiry is pursued in terms of krasauskas s toric patches  @xcite , as it relies upon the structure of toric varieties from algebraic geometry .",

    "while irrational patches may seem exotic for modeling , they occur naturally in statistics as discrete exponential families  @xcite and their blending functions may be computed using iterative proportional fitting ( ipf )  @xcite , a popular numerical algorithm from statistics . furthermore , these blending functions have linear precision . for toric patches , this",
    "was observed in  @xcite and developed in  @xcite , and the analysis there carries over to irrational patches .",

    "in fact , if there is a point @xmath19 at which no blending function vanishes , then _ any _ point in the interior of the convex hull of the control points is the image @xmath18 of some patch for some choice of weights . in this way ,",
    "the convex hull property is the strongest general statement that can be made about the location of a patch .",

    "the first curve has no points of self - intersection , while the second curve has one point of self - intersection .",
    "while this self - intersection may be removed by varying the weights attached to the control points , by theorem  [ cgs - th : inj ] it is impossible to find weights so that a curve with the first set of control points has a point of self - intersection .",
    "we will also show that the control polygon may be approximated by a bzier curve .",
