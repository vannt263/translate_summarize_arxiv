    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite provides a powerful theoretical method to understand the strongly coupled field theories in condensed matter physics . a holographic superconductor ( superfluid )",
    "model has been constructed recently in the work @xcite(for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the dual gravitational configurations are some anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes with / without some charged matter contents .",
    "the phase transition studied in refs.@xcite is actually a holographic superconductor / metal phase transition .",
    "the holographic superconductor model can be simply constructed by an einstein - maxwell theory with a negative cosmological constant coupled to a complex scalar field . in particular , when the temperature of the black hole is below a critical temperature , there are at least two distinct mechanisms leading to the black hole solution unstable to develop a scalar hair near the horizon @xcite . and the condensation of the scalar hair induces the local u(1 ) symmetry breaking of the system , which gives the nonvanishing vacuum expectation value to the dual charged operator in the boundary field theory .",
    "therefor , the u(1 ) symmetry breaking in gravity leads to a breaking of the global u(1 ) symmetry in the dual field theory .",
    "this results in a superconductor ( superfluid ) phase transition .",
    "the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition was first researched in ref.@xcite .",
    "a five - dimensional ads soliton background @xcite coupled to a maxwell field and a scalar field was used to model the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition at zero temperature .",
    "the normal phase in the ads soliton is dual to a confined gauge theory with a mass gap which is reminiscent of an insulator phase @xcite . as the chemical potential grows sufficiently up to a critical value ,",
    "the instability is triggered , resulting in the emergence of the scalar hair which is dual to a superconducting phase in the boundary field theory .",
    "the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition was also investigated in refs.@xcite .",
    "there are some discussions of holographic superconductors in the presence of magnetic field @xcite , but they mainly focused on superconductor / metal phase transition",
    ". motivated by these studies and especially by our previous works @xcite , we expect to explore how the magnetic field impacts the behavior of the condensate if a magnetic field is added into the ads soliton spacetime .",
    "we are working in the probe limit , which means that the scalar field and maxwell field have no back - reaction to the gravity background .    in this paper",
    ", we first adopt the idea of marginally stable modes @xcite to study the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition in ads soliton background at zero temperature .",
    "we employ the method introduced in ref.@xcite to study the quasinormal modes(qnms ) of the scalar perturbations of the system just like the one in ref.@xcite . at some critical values of the chemical potential @xmath0 and magnetic field @xmath1",
    ", the marginally stable modes will emerge .",
    "this represents that at the critical parameters , the ads soliton background becomes unstable and will be fond of an ads soliton background coupled with the hair of charged scalar fields .",
    "in particular , for some given mass @xmath2 and charge @xmath3 , the special combination of the critical chemical potential @xmath0 and the critical magnetic field @xmath1 satisfies a simple relation , _ i.e. _ @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a positive constant . the minus sign in the combination is interesting because , as the magnetic field grows stronger , the critical chemical potential becomes higher .",
    "this indicates that the presence of the magnetic field causes the transition from insulator to superconductor to be difficult . setting the magnetic field vanishing ,",
    "the critical chemical potentials we derived are consistent with the results obtained by previous works @xcite .",
    "actually , corresponding to various critical parameters , there are multiple marginally stable modes related to the nodes @xmath6 , which are unstable due to the oscillations of the field in the radial direction @xcite . taking advantage of the shooting method , we plot the profile of the scalar field depending on the radial direction . from these diagrams",
    ", one can intuitively see the  nodes \" of the scalar field .",
    "furthermore , using the variational method for the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem @xcite , we analytically study the holographic insulator / superconductors phase transition , following the previous work in ref.@xcite . near the critical point",
    ", we show a simple relation among the critical chemical potential , magnetic field , the charge and mass of the scalar field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sect : back ] , we introduce the ads soliton background and obtain the equations of motion in the probe limit .",
    "we study the marginally stable modes in sec.[sect : qnms ] . in sec.[sect : shoot ] the system is solved by shooting method . in sec.[sect : sturm ] we extract the relation of the four parameters at the critical phase transition points using the variational method for the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem . conclusions and discussions are drawn in sec.[sect : con ] .",
    "we construct the model of the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition with the einstein - maxwell - scalar action in five - dimensional spacetime : s = d^5x(r+-f_f^-|_-iqa_|^2-m^2||^2),where @xmath7 is the radius of ads spacetime .",
    "when the maxwell field and scalar field are absent , the above action admits the ads soliton solution  @xcite : [ metric ] ds^2=l^2+r^2(-dt^2+d^2+^2d^2)+f(r)d^2.where @xmath8 . in this paper . ] the asymptotical geometry approaches to @xmath9 near the boundary .",
    "moreover , the scherk - schwarz compactification @xmath10 is needed to obtain a smooth geometry .",
    "this gives a dual picture of a three - dimensional field theory with a mass gap , which resembles an insulator in the condensed matter physics .",
    "the geometry in @xmath11 directions just looks like a cigar whose tip is at @xmath12 .",
    "the temperature in this background is zero .",
    "the equations of motion ( eoms ) of matter fields are [ eompsi ] & & ( _ -iqa_)(^-iqa^)-m^2=0 , + [ eoma ] & & _ f^=iq [ |(^-iqa^)-(^+iqa^)|].the boundary conditions for the matter fields near the infinity @xmath13 of the ads soliton are [ bcpsi]&=&^(1)r^-2++^(2)r^-2-+  , + [ bca ] a_t&=&-+  ,where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the corresponding dual operators of @xmath16 in the boundary field theory .",
    "the conformal dimensions of the operators are @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath18 are the corresponding chemical potential and charge density in the boundary field theory .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we work in the probe limit , where the maxwell field and scalar field do not back react on the background metric . when there is no condensate , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath19 , eoms have the solution [ asolution ] a = dt+b^2d.in addition to a constant chemical potential @xmath0 , adding a constant magnetic field @xmath1 to the maxwell field is also consistent in the probe limit .",
    "as the scalar field @xmath20 does not vanish , we must solve the coupled eoms .",
    "however , near the critical point of phase transition the scalar field is nearly zero , we can treat @xmath20 as a probe into this background which is a neutral ads soliton with a constant electric potential and magnetic field .",
    "we are interested in axisymmetric solutions in which all fields are independent of @xmath21 .",
    "we consider an ansatz of the form @xmath22 .",
    "substituting @xmath20 into eq . and making the separation of the variables , we can obtain & & + ( 3r+)-+ + & & + ( q^2 ^ 2-m^2r^2 - -k^2)f(t , r)=0,where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of the following equations , respectively : = -^2h ( ) , + [ u()]-q^2 b^2 ^ 2 u()=-k^2 u(),where @xmath25 , @xmath26 owing to the periodicity of @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 solves the equation for a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator with frequency determined by @xmath1 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we expect that the lowest mode @xmath31 will be the first to condense and result in the most stable solution after condensing .",
    "we can also set @xmath32 and @xmath33 without loss of generality .",
    "we finally obtain the equation of motion of @xmath34 : [ feom ] & & + ( 3r+)-+ + & & + ( q^2 ^ 2-|qb|-m^2r^2)f(t , r)=0 .",
    "note that in this case , @xmath35 , so for any finite magnetic field , the superconducting condensate will be localized to a finite circular region .",
    "as the magnetic field becomes smaller , the region grows until it occupies the whole plane , which can be seen in the profile of @xmath28 by setting @xmath36 .",
    "we can also see similar phenomena in other gravity background  @xcite .",
    "to reveal the stability of a spacetime background , an effective method is to analyze the qnms of the perturbations in the fixed background ( for reviews , see refs.@xcite .",
    "the temporal part of the qnms behave like @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , if the imaginary part of the qnms is negative , the mode will decay in time and the perturbation will ultimately fade away , indicating that the background is stable against this perturbation .",
    "in sharp contrast , if the imaginary part is positive , the background is unstable .",
    "the critical case is that if the perturbation has a marginally stable mode , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath38 , one always expects that this is a signal of instability , where a phase transition may occur  @xcite .    in order to study the phase transitions in the background , we further define @xmath39 , and eq .",
    "becomes [ reom ] r   ( r)+(+3r)r  (r)+[(+q)^2-|qb|-m^2r^2]r(r)=0,where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "taking advantage of the horowitz and hubeny s method @xcite to study these qnms , we find it is convenient to work in the @xmath41-coordinate where @xmath42 . in this new coordinate , the infinite boundary is now at @xmath43 , while the tip is at @xmath44 .",
    "equation ( [ reom ] ) becomes [ maineom ] r   ( z)+[-1z+]r  (z)+[z^2(+q)^2-z^2|qb|-m^2]r(z)=0,where we make the prime denote the derivative with respect to @xmath41 from now on .",
    "following the procedure of horowitz and hubeny @xcite , we multiply @xmath45 to both sides of the above equation , and we obtain [ maineq ] s(z)r   ( z)+r  (z)+r(z)=0 , where the coefficients are given by s(z)&= & , + t(z)&=&-z^3f(z)+z^4f  (z ) , + [ potential]v(z)&=&(z-1).@xmath46 and @xmath47 are all polynomials and can be expanded to a finite order as [ sexpand ] s(z)=_j=0^j s_j(z-1)^j , where @xmath48 is a finite integer . @xmath49 and @xmath47 can be polynomially expanded similarly .",
    "because of the absence of a black hole horizon in the ads soliton , the boundary condition at the tip is a finite quantity .",
    "this motivates us to find a solution like [ expand ] r(z)=_n_n=0^na_n(z-1)^n.substituting eqs . and into eq .",
    "and comparing the coefficients of @xmath50 for the same order , we find that [ an ] a_n&=&-_k=0^n-1[k(k-1)s_n - k+k t_n - k+v_n - k]a_k , + [ hn ] h_n&=&n(n-1)s_0+nt_0+v_0=-4n^2.we set @xmath51 for simplicity because of the linearity of eq .. the boundary condition for the scalar field at @xmath43 is [ r0 ] r(0)=_n_n=0^na_n(-1)^n=0.and the algebraic equation can solve the modes @xmath52 .",
    "we restrict @xmath53 just like the one in ref.@xcite in the numerical calculations . in practice , we will expand @xmath54 to a large order which is @xmath55 in this paper . because of the fact that the real part of the frequency indicates the energy of the mode , we only take care of the qnms with a positive real part . from the numerical results which are plotted in figure . , we find that when a marginally stable mode arises , the square of chemical potential @xmath56 and magnetic field @xmath1 satisfy a simple linear relation , whose slope is particularly one , and the intercept just gives the square of critical chemical potential in the absence of magnetic field , which is consistent with our previous work @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath57 which determines the stability of the system .",
    "the minus sign in the combination is interesting , which means as the magnetic field grows stronger , the critical chemical potential becomes higher .",
    "this indicates that the presence of the magnetic field causes the transition from insulator to superconductor to be difficult . by increasing @xmath5 to some critical value ,",
