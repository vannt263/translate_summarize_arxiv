    "a consistent and unified treatment of mean - field and pairing correlations is crucial for a quantitative analysis of ground - state properties and multipole response of unstable , weakly bound nuclei far from the line of @xmath2-stability . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have formulated the relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) in the canonical single - nucleon basis of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model .",
    "the rhb model presents the relativistic extension of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov framework , and it provides a unified description of particle - hole ( @xmath3 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath4 ) correlations . in this framework the ground state of a nucleus can be written either in the quasiparticle basis as a product of independent quasi - particle states , or in the canonical basis as a highly correlated bcs - state . by definition ,",
    "the canonical basis diagonalizes the density matrix and it is always localized .",
    "it describes both the bound states and the positive - energy single - particle continuum .",
    "the formulation of the rqrpa in the canonical basis is particularly convenient because , in order to describe transitions to low - lying excited states in weakly bound nuclei , the two - quasiparticle configuration space must include states with both nucleons in the discrete bound levels , states with one nucleon in a bound level and one nucleon in the continuum , and also states with both nucleons in the continuum .",
    "the relativistic qrpa of ref .",
    "@xcite is fully self - consistent . for the interaction in the particle - hole channel",
    "effective lagrangians with nonlinear meson self - interactions are used , and pairing correlations are described by the pairing part of the finite range gogny interaction . both in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels ,",
    "the same interactions are used in the rhb equations that determine the canonical quasiparticle basis , and in the matrix equations of the rqrpa .",
    "the rqrpa configuration space includes also the dirac sea of negative energy states .",
    "the rhb+rqrpa approach has been tested in the example of multipole excitations of neutron rich oxygen isotopes , and the model has been employed in the analysis of the evolution of the low - lying isovector dipole strength in sn isotopes and n=82 isotones .",
    "relativistic mean - field and rpa calculations based on effective lagrangians with nonlinear meson self - interactions present not only a number of technical problems , but also the description of finite nuclei obtained with these effective interactions is not satisfactory , especially for isovector properties . as an alternative , in a number of recent applications models with density - dependent meson - nucleon vertex functions have been used .",
    "although the two classes of models are essentially based on the same microscopic structure , i.e. on density - dependent interactions , the latter can be more directly related to the underlying microscopic nuclear interactions .",
    "several recent analyses have shown that relativistic effective interactions with explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings provide an improved description of asymmetric nuclear matter , neutron matter and nuclei far from stability . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have extended the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model to include density dependent meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the effective lagrangian is characterized by a phenomenological density dependence of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson - nucleon vertex functions , adjusted to properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "it has been shown that , in comparison with standard rmf effective interactions with nonlinear meson - exchange terms , the new density - dependent meson - nucleon force dd - me1 significantly improves the description of asymmetric nuclear matter and of ground - state properties of @xmath8 nuclei .",
    "this is , of course , very important for the extension of rmf - based models to exotic nuclei far from @xmath2-stability , and for applications in the field of nuclear astrophysics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the matrix equations of the relativistic random - phase approximation ( rrpa ) have been derived for an effective lagrangian characterized by density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the explicit density dependence introduces rearrangement terms in the residual two - body interaction , and their contribution is essential for a quantitative description of excited states .",
    "illustrative calculations of the isoscalar monopole , isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole response of @xmath9pb , were performed in the fully self - consistent rrpa framework based on effective interactions with a phenomenological density dependence adjusted to nuclear matter and ground - state properties of spherical nuclei .    in this work",
    "we extend the model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and formulate a proton - neutron relativistic qrpa in the canonical single - nucleon basis of the rhb model .",
    "the proton - neutron rqrpa , with the density - dependent effective interaction dd - me1 , will be employed in the analysis of nuclear spin and isospin excitations .",
    "collective spin and isospin excitations in atomic nuclei have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies ( for an extensive review see ref .",
    "nucleons with spin up and spin down can oscillate either in phase ( spin scalar s=0 mode ) or out of phase ( spin vector s=1 mode ) .",
    "the spin vector , or spin - flip excitations can be of isoscalar ( s=1 , t=0 ) or isovector ( s=1 , t=1 ) nature .",
    "these collective modes provide direct information on the spin and spin - isospin dependence of the effective nuclear interaction .",
    "especially interesting is the collective spin - isospin oscillation with the excess neutrons coherently changing the direction of their spins and isospins without changing their orbital motion  the gamow - teller resonance ( gtr ) @xmath10 .",
    "this collective mode was predicted already in 1963 @xcite , but it was only in 1975 that the first experimental indications of the gt resonance were observed in @xmath11 charge - exchange reactions at intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "the detailed knowledge of gt strength distributions is essential for the understanding of nuclear reactions in the process of nucleosynthesis .",
    "in particular , the low - lying gt strength is directly related to @xmath2-decay rates , as well as to the electron - capture process leading to the stellar collapse and supernovae explosion . in many nuclei all over the periodic table the gt strength distribution ,",
    "when measured in the excitation energy region where the most pronounced gt peaks occur , is quenched by more than 20% when compared to a model independent sum rule .",
    "two physically different mechanisms had been suggested as a possible explanation of the quenching of the total gtr strength : ( i ) nuclear configuration mixing  the high - lying @xmath12 states mix with the @xmath13 gt states and shift the gt strength to high - energy region far beyond the resonance @xcite ; ( ii ) the high - energy @xmath14-isobar  nucleon - hole configurations ( @xmath15 ) couple to the gt mode and remove part of the strength from the low - lying excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "recent @xmath11 scattering experiments have shown , however , that only a small fraction of the gt quenching originates from @xmath15 transitions @xcite .",
    "the gt spin - flip isovector excitations and the related @xmath2-decays have been theoretically investigated by employing : ( i ) the shell - model approach , ( ii ) the non - relativistic proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation , and ( iii ) the relativistic random phase approximation in closed - shell nuclei . experimental data on charge - exchange excitations in light and medium - mass nuclei are very successfully reproduced by large - scale shell - model calculations . however , as the number of valence nucleons increases , the dimension of shell - model configuration space becomes far too large for practical calculations .",
    "shell - model calculations have been recently extended to the region of @xmath16-shell nuclei with @xmath17 .",
    "experimental gamow - teller strength distributions and nuclear @xmath2-decay half - lives have been reproduced  @xcite . the gt response in medium - mass nuclei",
    "has also been successfully described by shell - model monte carlo calculations ( smmc ) @xcite . the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) can be used to describe nuclei in mass regions that are presently beyond the reach of the most sophisticated shell - model calculations .",
    "the pioneering work of halbleib and sorensen  @xcite was based on simple separable forces .",
    "further developments employed zero - range interactions with bcs - type pairing .",
    "most studies of gt excitations have been based on skyrme interactions @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the inclusion of particle - particle correlations in the qrpa residual interaction has an important effect in the calculation of @xmath2-decay rates  @xcite .",
    "experimental data on unstable nuclei close to n = z line , that became available in recent studies with radioactive beams , have also renewed the interest in the role of proton - neutron pairing . in medium - heavy and heavy nuclei closer to the line of @xmath2-stability ,",
    "the proton and neutron fermi levels are located in different major shells , and therefore the contribution of proton - neutron pairing correlations to the ground - state binding is usually neglected . the low - lying gt strength responsible for @xmath2-decay ,",
    "however , involves proton - neutron particle - particle correlations and is sensitive to the @xmath1 pairing interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath2-decay rates for spherical neutron - rich @xmath18-process waiting - point nuclei have been calculated within a fully self - consistent qrpa , formulated in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov canonical single - particle basis .",
    "it has been shown that the proton - neutron particle - particle interaction has a pronounced effect on the calculated half - lives .",
    "surprisingly little work has been reported on the description of charge - exchange excitations in finite nuclei in the framework of relativistic mean - field models .",
    "the first relativistic rpa calculations of isobaric analog resonances ( iar ) and gamow - teller resonances have been performed only recently in refs .",
    "this analysis was , however , restricted to doubly closed - shell nuclei .",
    "a rather small configuration space was used and , furthermore , configurations that include empty states from the negative - energy dirac sea were neglected . in a very recent work @xcite it has been shown , on the other hand , that the inclusion of negative - energy dirac sea states has a pronounced effect on the calculated gamow - teller sum rule .",
    "a more complete relativistic rpa calculation of gt resonances in doubly closed - shell nuclei has been reported in ref .",
    "the ground states of @xmath19ca , @xmath20zr and @xmath9pb were calculated in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model with the nl3 effective interaction .",
    "the spin - isospin correlations in the rrpa calculation of the gt response functions were induced by the isovector mesons @xmath21 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the standard non - linear nl3 effective interaction @xcite with the vector rho - nucleon coupling , the effective lagrangian included the pseudo - vector pion - nucleon interaction .",
    "although in the relativistic mean - field description of the nuclear ground state the direct one - pion contribution vanishes at the hartree level because of parity conservation , the pion nevertheless plays an important role for excitations that involve spin degrees of freedom . since it has a relatively small mass , the pion mediates the effective nuclear interaction over large distances .",
    "the @xmath22 residual interaction with @xmath7- and @xmath21-meson exchange has been extensively used in non - relativistic rpa calculations of charge - exchange excitations @xcite .",
    "because of the derivative type of the pion - nucleon coupling , it is also necessary to include a zero - range landau - migdal term that accounts for the contact part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the rrpa calculation with the nl3 effective interaction , the pseudo - vector pion - nucleon coupling ( @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 ) , and the landau - migdal force with the strength parameter @xmath25 , reproduces the experimental excitation energies of the main components of the gt resonances in @xmath19ca , @xmath20zr and @xmath9pb .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have calculated the gtr and iar for a sequence of even - even sn target nuclei by using the framework of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model plus proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation .",
    "the calculation reproduces the experimental data on ground - state properties , as well as the excitation energies of the isovector excitations .",
    "it has been shown that the isotopic dependence of the energy spacings between the gtr and iar provides direct information on the evolution of neutron skin - thickness along the sn isotopic chain .",
    "a new method has been suggested for determining the difference between the radii of the neutron and proton density distributions along an isotopic chain , based on measurement of the excitation energies of the gtr relative to the iar .",

    "in ref .  @xcite we have derived the relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) from the time - dependent relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model in the limit of small amplitude oscillations .",
    "the full rqrpa equations are rather complicated and it is considerably simpler to solve these equations in the canonical basis , in which the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov wave functions can be expressed in the form of bcs - like wave functions . in this case",
    "one needs only the matrix elements @xmath26 of the residual @xmath3-interaction , and the matrix elements @xmath27 of the pairing @xmath4-interaction , as well as certain combinations of the occupation factors @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",

    "one of the important characteristics of an iar is its narrow width .",

    "proton - neutron pairing , of course , does not contribute in the rhb calculation of the ground states .",
    "the dashed curves are calculated by including only the @xmath3-channel of the rqrpa residual interaction . in both cases ( solid and dashed curves ) @xmath0 neutron - neutron pairing has been included in the rhb calculations of the ground - states of sn target nuclei .",

    "the effect of the proton - neutron residual pairing on the iar strength distributions in lighter sn isotopes with @xmath93 is more dramatic . without the contribution of the @xmath4-channel to the proton - neutron residual interaction ,",
    "the response function is fragmented and it does not display the experimentally observed single narrow resonance . only with the inclusion of proton - neutron pairing a single collective state is obtained .    the mechanism through which the pn - rqrpa builds the iar in sn isotopes is illustrated in fig .  [ fige ] for @xmath94sn , @xmath95sn and @xmath96sn .",
    "the figure displays the discrete qrpa spectra for the following three cases . in the panels on the left we plot the spectra calculated without any pairing interaction , either in calculation of the ground - state , or in the residual proton - neutron interaction .",

    "the distribution of neutron - to - proton rpa amplitudes is shown next to each major peak .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath94sn 99% of the strength results from the transition @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 , whereas for @xmath96sn 98% of the strength is distributed between the four orbitals occupied by the neutrons in the @xmath99 shell . in the next step ( middle panels in fig .  [ fige ] )",
    "we include the gogny neutron - neutron pairing in the rhb calculation of the ground states , and as a result all the @xmath99 neutron orbitals acquire finite occupation probabilities .",
    "the @xmath4-channel , however , is not allowed to contribute to the qrpa matrix elements of the proton - neutron residual interaction . in this case",
    "the qrpa spectra become fragmented in @xmath94sn and @xmath95sn .",
    "considerable strength is transferred to states which correspond to transitions from neutron orbitals with low occupation probabilities : @xmath104 and @xmath100 .",
    "for the most pronounced peaks we have included the distribution of neutron - to - proton qrpa amplitudes.the fragmentation does not occur in @xmath96sn where , as a result of ground - state pairing correlations , all the @xmath99 neutron orbitals have considerable occupation probabilities . in @xmath96sn we notice only a redistribution of qrpa amplitudes in favor of higher - lying orbitals , and consequently the repulsive particle - hole residual interaction shifts the iar to higher energy .",
    "for the two nuclei from the lower half of the @xmath99 neutron shell , the @xmath3 residual interaction fragments the qrpa spectra and effectively precludes the formation of the iar .",
    "the panels on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fige ] display the result obtained by fully - consistent pn - rqrpa calculations , including the @xmath0 proton - neutron pairing channel : the strength has been collected in a single peak  the iar .",
    "we notice that with respect to the case ( a ) without any pairing correlations , the iar strength has been redistributed among the neutron - to - proton qrpa amplitudes , reflecting the occupation of higher - lying neutron orbitals in the parent nucleus .",
    "the calculated excitation energies , as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ figb ] , are in very good agreement with the experimental data on the iar in sn nuclei @xcite .",
    "the total effect is , of course , simply a consequence of the fact that the pairing interaction is isospin invariant , and therefore commutes with the fermi operator ( [ iaroperator ] ) .",

    "in addition , the standard values have been used for the parameters of the pion - nucleon interaction lagrangian : @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 , and the parameter of the zero - range landau - migdal force @xmath110 has been adjusted to reproduce the excitation energy of the gt resonance in @xmath9pb .",
    "the calculated resonances are shown in comparison with experimental data ( thick arrows ) for the gtr excitation energies in @xmath19ca  @xcite , @xmath20zr  @xcite , and @xmath9pb  @xcite .",
    "although the residual interaction has been adjusted to reproduce the gtr excitation energy in @xmath9pb , we notice a very good agreement with experiment also for @xmath19ca and @xmath20zr .",
    "the adjusted value of @xmath111 in general depends on the choice of the rmf effective interaction . in the rrpa calculation with the nl1  @xcite effective interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite , the gtr excitation energies of @xmath19ca , @xmath20zr and @xmath9pb were best reproduced by @xmath112 , whereas approximately the same quality of agreement with experimental data was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the nl3  @xcite effective interaction and @xmath113 . by using a set of density - dependent rmf effective interactions from ref .",
    "@xcite we have verified that , in general , there is a correlation between the value of the nuclear asymmetry energy at saturation @xmath114 , and the value of @xmath111 adjusted to reproduce the gtr . in order to reproduce the experimental excitation energy of the gtr , effective interactions with higher values of @xmath114 generally require higher values of @xmath111 .",
    "gamow - teller states calculated in relativistic models have recently attracted considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that in a relativistic rpa calculation the total gt strength in the nucleon sector is reduced by @xmath115% in nuclear matter , and by @xmath116% in finite nuclei when compared to the ikeda sum rule @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the total sum of gamow - teller strength for the @xmath119 transition .",
    "the reduction has been attributed to the effect of dirac sea negative - energy states , i.e. the missing part of the sum rule is taken by particle - hole excitations formed from ground - state configurations of occupied states in the fermi sea and empty negative - energy states in the dirac sea . the effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figg ] , where we display the running sum of gtr strength for @xmath9pb .",
    "the horizontal dotted line corresponds to the value @xmath120 of the ikeda sum rule .",
    "the solid and dashed lines corresponds the values of the gtr sum calculated from @xmath121 to the excitation energy denoted on the abscissa .",
    "the big jump in the calculated gtr sum occurs , of course , when the main gtr peak at @xmath122 mev is included .",
    "the rrpa calculation represented by the dashed line includes only positive energy @xmath3 configurations . even extending the sum up to 60 mev , the total sum amounts only to @xmath123 , that is 8% less than the ikeda sum rule .",
    "the total sum rule @xmath124 is exhausted by the calculated gt strength only when the relativistic rpa / qrpa space contains @xmath3 excitations formed from ground - state configurations of the fully or partially occupied states of positive energy , and the empty negative - energy states from the dirac sea ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ figg ] ) . the corresponding discrete gt spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "two regions of excitation energies are shown .",
    "the panel on the right - hand side contains the positive energy @xmath84 strength , with a pronounced gamow - teller peak at @xmath122 mev .",
    "the left panel displays the negative energy spectrum built from @xmath125 transitions ( @xmath126 denotes a negative energy state ) . even though these transitions are much weaker than the gtr , there are many of them and their overall sum represents the strength missing in the positive energy sector .",
    "similar results for the gtr sum rule are also obtained for @xmath19ca and @xmath20zr .    for the case of open - shell nuclei we will compare the pn - rqrpa results with experimental data on gamow - teller resonances obtained from sn(@xmath87he , t)sb charge - exchange reactions  @xcite .",
    "the gt strength distribution in @xmath127sn is shown in fig .",
    "direct spin - flip transitions ( @xmath128 @xmath102 @xmath129 ) dominate the high - energy region above 10 mev .",
    "the low - energy tail of the strength distribution corresponds to core - polarization ( @xmath130 @xmath102 @xmath131 ) , and back spin - flip ( @xmath132 @xmath102 @xmath133 ) transitions .",
    "the solid curve in fig .  [ figi ] has been calculated without including the @xmath1 proton - neutron pairing in the rqrpa residual interaction .",
    "the resulting high - energy gt strength displays pronounced fragmentation .",
    "this fragmentation , however , is not induced by coupling to @xmath12 configurations ( not included in the present version of the rqrpa ) , rather it is caused by the splitting between different @xmath3 configurations .",
    "gtr configuration splitting ( an appearance of two or more collective bumps with comparable intensities in the gtr strength function ) was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the shell optical model . for sn nuclei , in particular , this effect was predicted to occur as the valence neutron start to occupy the level with the highest @xmath134 in the shell  @xmath100 .",
    "the configuration splitting was attributed to the fact that the unperturbed energies of the @xmath135 and @xmath136 configurations are almost degenerate .",
    "the residual interaction removes this degeneracy and , as a result , the main gt component separates in two distinct peaks .",
    "the ground - state pairing correlations have a strong influence on the occupation of the @xmath137 level , and therefore the energy spacing between the two peaks will depend on @xmath0 pairing . for @xmath127sn",
    "the calculated splitting of the gtr was 2.6 mev  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the fragmentation and splitting of the gtr in sn nuclei was experimentally investigated in ref .",
    "the theoretically predicted configuration splitting of the main gt component , however , could not be observed , since the total widths of the resonances of @xmath138 mev exceed the predicted splitting .",
    "the splitting of the main gt component shown in fig .",
    "[ figi ] ( solid line ) of @xmath139 mev is in agreement with the result of ref .",
    "in addition , we find a third direct spin - flip component in the region above 10 mev , predominately based on the configuration @xmath140 .",
    "the other curves shown in fig .",
    "[ figi ] ( dotted , dashed and dot - dashed ) have been calculated with the inclusion of the @xmath1 proton - neutron pairing ( [ pn - pair ] ) in the rqrpa residual interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite the overall strength parameter @xmath81 of the interaction was adjusted to measured half - lives of neutron - rich nuclei in regions where @xmath18-process path comes closest to the valley of stability : @xmath141 mev near @xmath142 and @xmath81 = 170 mev near @xmath92 . in the present analysis , however , @xmath2-decay half - lives are not calculated and we could not adjust @xmath81 in this way .",
    "the gt strength functions shown in fig .",
    "[ figi ] have been calculated for @xmath143 200 , 250 and 300 mev , respectively .",
    "as one would expect , the inclusion of @xmath1 pairing has a strong influence on the low - lying tail of the gt distribution , i.e. on the region that contributes to @xmath2-decay . here , however , we are concerned with the main gt component .",
    "an important effect that we notice is the disappearance of configuration splitting between the two high - energy peaks .",
    "this happens because the @xmath1 pairing interaction does not affect configurations based on the @xmath144 orbital ( fully occupied ) , whereas it lowers configurations based on @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( partially occupied ) .",
    "our calculation therefore shows that the @xmath1 proton - neutron pairing strongly reduces the predicted configuration splitting of the main high - energy gt component .",
    "in addition to the main gtr at @xmath147 mev , however , part of the strength associated with direct spin - flip transitions is concentrated at @xmath148 mev .",
    "another interesting result is that the centroid of the gt strength composed of direct spin - flip transitions ( @xmath128 @xmath102 @xmath129 ) practically does not depend on the strength of the @xmath1 proton - neutron @xmath4 residual interaction .",
    "this is shown in the insert of fig .",
    "[ figi ] , where we plot the calculated centroid of the direct spin - flip gt strength , as function of the strength parameter @xmath81 .",
    "since we could not use experimental data on the gtr centroid to adjust the strength of the @xmath1 pairing channel , the following illustrative calculations have been performed with @xmath143 250 mev .    in a recent pn - rqrpa calculation",
    "@xcite we have shown that the isotopic dependence of the energy spacings between the gtr and iar provides direct information on the evolution of neutron skin - thickness along the sn isotopic chain .",
    "it has been suggested that the difference between the radii of the neutron and proton density distributions along an isotopic chain , could be determined from the measurement of the excitation energies of the gtr relative to the iar .",
    "the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , was performed with the nl3 relativistic mean - field effective interaction .",
    "although nl3 has become a standard in rmf calculations , like many other non - linear meson - exchange effective interactions it has a high nuclear matter asymmetry energy , and consequently it predicts rather large values for neutron density distribution radii . here",
    "we repeat the calculation using the dd - me1 effective interaction . among other ground - state nuclear properties ,",
    "the parameters of dd - me1 have also been adjusted to experimental data on differences between radii of neutron and proton distributions .    in fig .",
    "[ figj ] we display the calculated differences between the centroids of the direct spin - flip gt strength and the respective isobaric analog resonances for the sequence of even - even sn target nuclei .",
    "for @xmath88 the results of rhb plus pn - rqrpa calculation ( dd - me1 density - dependent effective interaction , gogny @xmath0 pairing , @xmath1 pairing interaction ( [ pn - pair ] ) with @xmath143 250 mev , the landau - migdal parameter @xmath110 ) , are compared with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the calculated energy spacings are in very good agreement with the experimental values . as it has been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy difference between the gtr and the ias reflects the magnitude of the effective spin - orbit potential .",
    "many relativistic mean - field calculations have shown that the magnitude of the spin - orbit potential is considerably reduced in neutron - rich nuclei @xcite , and a corresponding increase of the neutron skin has been predicted . in fig .",
    "[ figk ] the calculated and experimental energy spacings between the gtr and ias are plotted as a function of the calculated differences between the rms radii of the neutron and proton density distributions of even - even sn isotopes ( upper panel ) .",
    "notice the uniform dependence of the energy difference between the gtr and ias on the size of the neutron - skin .",
    "this means that , in principle , the value of @xmath149 can be directly determined from the theoretical curve for a given value of @xmath150 . in the lower panel the calculated differences between neutron and proton rms radii are compared with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theoretical and experimental values suggests that the neutron - skin thickness can be determined from the measurement of the excitation energies of the gtr relative to ias .",
    "in this second part of the work on the relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) , we have formulated the proton - neutron rqrpa in the canonical single - nucleon basis of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model , for an effective lagrangian characterized by density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the basic advantage of working in the canonical basis is that , since it diagonalizes the density matrix , the canonical basis is always localized and so it can be used both for bound states and for the positive energy single - particle continuum .",
    "this is especially important in the description of low - lying excited states and giant resonances in weakly bound nuclei far from stability . from the practical point of view , it is also considerably simpler to solve the rqrpa equations in the canonical basis , in which the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov wave functions can be expressed in the form of bcs - like wave functions .",
    "the inclusion of relativistic effective interactions with explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings provides an improved description of asymmetric nuclear matter , nuclear ground - states and properties of excited states , especially in nuclei far from stability .",
    "the pn - rqrpa model includes both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pairing channels , and the model space contains pair configurations formed from the fully or partially occupied states of positive energy in the fermi sea , and the empty negative - energy states from the dirac sea .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of configurations built from occupied positive - energy states and empty negative - energy states is essential in order to satisfy model independent sum rules .",
    "the proton - neutron relativistic qrpa provides a natural framework for the description of spin and isospin excitations . in this work",
    "the model has been applied to the analysis of charge - exchange modes : isobaric analog resonances and gamow - teller resonances .",
    "a very good agreement with experimental data has been obtained , both for doubly - closed shell nuclei and for open shell nuclei .",
    "the importance of a consistent treatment of pairing correlations has been demonstrated in the example of iar and gtr in sn isotopes .",
    "in addition to the ia and gt @xmath151 excitations , the ( p , n ) spectra show clear evidence for the collective spin - flip dipole ( @xmath152 ) @xmath153 excitation and spin - flip quadrupole ( @xmath154 ) @xmath155 excitation .",
    "the broad ( @xmath156 mev ) spin - flip dipole and quadrupole resonances can be interpreted as superpositions of three collective modes with spin - parity @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "it has not yet been possible to experimentally resolve these resonances into the different angular momentum components .",
    "recently it has been suggested that experimental data on charge - exchange spin - dipole resonances can be used to extract information about neutron - skin thickness in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the pn - rqrpa will be applied to the study of spin - multipole charge - exchange modes .",
    "an interesting question is whether such a self - consistent approach , which starts from the description of the nuclear ground - state , can simultaneously reproduce the dynamics of these high - lying and , in many cases , only weakly collective states .",
    "another important topic will be the calculation of @xmath2-decay rates in semi - magic neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "these nuclei are particularly important for @xmath18-process nucleosynthesys .",
    "their lifetimes are rather long and they determine the abundances of stable nuclides . very neutron - rich nuclei are also very difficult to reach experimentally , and at present the only information on @xmath2-decay rates is provided by theoretical calculations .",
    "this also emphasizes the importance of the comparison of the present approach with results of non - relativistic qrpa calculations .",
