    "developments in detector technology and opto - electronic hardware over the past decade have meant that real - time adaptive optical systems have now become a common feature of large ground - based optical and near - infrared telescopes ( recent reviews may be found in bonaccini & tyson 1998 , hardy 1998 & roddier 1999 ) however , while adaptive optics has enjoyed considerable recent success , other techniques that utilize post - detection data processing , rather than real - time compensation , have remained valuable for imaging at the very highest angular resolutions .",
    "the best known , and most straightforward of these to implement , is speckle imaging @xcite in which sequences of short - exposures of a target and an unresolved calibrator are used to recover high - resolution maps beyond the natural seeing limit .",
    "although this method in principle allows the recovery of images of arbitrary complexity , the difficulty of attaining an adequate signal - to - noise ratio has meant that it has mainly been confined to studies of binary stars ( see , for example , patience et al .",
    "1998 ) and other astronomical sources with similarly simple geometries ( though weigelt et al .",
    "1998 is a recent counterexample ) .",
    "one solution to this signal - to - noise problem is to modify the pupil geometry of the telescope using a mask so as to mimic the operation of a separated - element interferometer array such as the vlba .",
    "this process can be considered as finding an optimal balance between the level of atmospheric perturbations , the number of photons , and the amount of structural information measured about the source  all of which increase as the pupil area rises .",
    "when an aperture mask is being used , the data collection and analysis methods are similar to those utilized for speckle imaging , but with a reduction in the number of independent spatial frequencies measured , which is balanced by an improved signal - to - noise ratio on the data which are obtained .",
    "this post - processing approach has been widely exploited at optical wavelengths where it has established itself as the only method by which reliable images of the surfaces of nearby stars at the diffraction limit have been recovered for ground - based telescopes ( see , for example , buscher et al .",
    "1990 ; wilson dhillon & haniff  1997 ; tuthill haniff & baldwin  1999a ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report the first aperture masking experiments to exploit the new generation of 10m - class telescopes .",
    "we have used the the keck  i telescope with a variety of sparse multi - aperture pupil masks both to verify the signal - to - noise and calibration advantages of these pupil geometries , and to demonstrate the ability of this method to provide diffraction - limited imaging of resolved targets in the near infrared with excellent dynamic range .",
    "we have used multi - epoch measurements to establish the reliability of our imaging , and present near infrared maps of the highly - structured dust shells of a number of evolved stars at resolutions exceeding 50milli - arcseconds .",
    "aperture masking and conventional speckle interferometry share much in common , including the ultimate goal of recovering the complex visibility function of the target of interest ( i.e.  the fourier transform of its brightness distribution ) at all spatial frequencies up to the telescope diffraction limit .",
    "generally , although fourier amplitudes can be measured @xcite , phases are scrambled by the atmosphere necessitating the use of an observable known as the closure phase @xcite .",
    "more recently , closure phase concepts have been generalized into the mathematical formalism of bispectral or triple correlation analysis @xcite .",
    "apart from the mask itself , the instrumental set - up required for masking is almost identical to that for speckle , with sequences of short - exposure data frames being recorded at high magnification , allowing for the image degradation caused by atmospheric turbulence to be removed during post - processing .",
    "the principal difference between the two types of experiments is that in aperture masking the pupil geometry can be adjusted to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the implementation of a masking interferometer at the keck  i telescope is discussed in more detail in the following sections .      unlike most earlier aperture masking experiments ( e.g. haniff et al .",
    "1987 ; readhead et al .",
    "1988 ) , which used screens placed in a small re - imaged pupil , masking of the keck primary was achieved by placing large ( @xmath0 cm on a side hexagonal ) aluminium masks directly in front of the f/25 infrared secondary mirror as shown in figure  1 . at this location ,",
    "beams propagating to the detector are sufficiently well separated that masks can be treated as selecting discrete portions of the pupil , despite this not being a true pupil plane . with this design , however , the masks intercept radiation from the source twice : once on the way from the primary to the secondary , and a second time when traveling back towards the detector . as a consequence ,",
    "masks selecting @xmath1 sub - apertures on the primary mirror in principle require @xmath2 holes . in order to accommodate this double - pass correctly",
    ", ray tracing software was used to confirm that rays passing through each sub - aperture could indeed be traced back to discrete regions on the primary mirror .",
    "the masks were fabricated of 3/16 \" aluminium sheet , and were mounted on a custom - built cylindrical post that protruded through the central hole of the f/25 secondary . at this location ,",
    "the masks could be accessed during the night , permitting changes from one mask to another to optimize the configuration for a given source ( this swap procedure took approximately 10min ) . a typical desired pupil shape and the mask required to implement it are shown in figure  [ mech_mask ] .",
    "after passing through the mask , the beams were focused on the keck facility near - ir camera , nirc , using external magnifying optics ( the so - called image converter ; matthews et al .",
    "the plate scale was 20.57 milli - arcsec / pixel on the 256@xmath3256 pixel insb array ; sufficient to nyquist sample data collected in the k - band or longer wavelength bands .",
    "the observing wavelengths were selected from nirc s standard complement of interference filters which offered a range of bandwidths ( 1  @xmath4  20% ) covering the 1  ",
    "3.5@xmath5 m region .",
    "although the masks were not cooled , this had little impact on the experiment . at wavelengths shorter than the k band , the fast exposures ( typically 140ms or less ) ensured that there was little contribution from thermal emission . at longer wavelengths , thermal emission from the masks",
    "should have been a significant factor . however , the masks produced only a negligible increase in the thermal background , primarily because of the design of the nirc magnifying optics . because nirc contains only a single cooled lyot stop , when the image converter ( matthews et al .",
    "1996 ) is in use , the cold stop is significantly oversized .",
    "the array is exposed to room - temperature radiation ( mostly from baffles and other camera structures ) , so the presence of the masks had little effect on the thermal background , which was already dominated by ambient flux .",
    "most pupil mask designs used non - redundant configurations of sub - apertures , each with an effective size when projected onto the primary mirror of 20    35 cm .",
    "this was tailored to be of order the seeing scale size , @xmath6 .",
    "the lack of redundancy ensured that any fourier component measured could be uniquely identified with a particular pair of sub - apertures , while the small sizes minimized the effects of wavefront perturbations across each sub - aperture ( @xmath7 radian r.m.s ) .",
    "however , the segmented nature of the keck primary mirror , and the undersized infrared secondary significantly complicated the task of locating the sub - apertures . in particular when designing the masks , geometries where sub - apertures were crossed by the telescope spider or panel boundaries in the segmented primary mirror had to be avoided where possible .",
    "designs were also driven by the desire that snapshot fourier plane coverage be uniform and isotropic .",
    "the specific nature of these constraints meant that it was not possible to exploit the results of keto ( 1997 ) or cornwell ( 1988 ) , both of whom explored optimum snapshot array configurations for radio interferometers .",
    "mask designs were based on the approach of golay ( 1970 ) , in which 3-fold symmetric spaces were searched for non - redundant array solutions with compact and dense uv - coverage .",
    "examples of arrays developed for 15- and 21-hole masks are shown in figures  [ mech_mask ] and [ mask_ps ] .",
    "as can be seen in the 21-hole mask , the fourier plane coverage has a densely filled core out to baselines of approximately 3 m , and then adequate , but not isotropic coverage out to the edge of the telescope pupil .",
    "solutions with numbers of apertures as large as 36 were found , but for many experiments a 21-hole mask was more than adequate : this allowed the simultaneous measurement of 210 baselines and 1330 closure phases , yielding an excellent snapshot imaging capability .",
    "apart from defining the spatial frequencies measured by the telescope , the aperture mask also served to limit the total amount of flux collected . for observations of bright sources ( m supergiants and miras can have k magnitudes as high as @xmath8mag ) this was an important feature , as the use of the unobscured pupil would have saturated nirc in a small fraction of the minimum available exposure time , despite the use of the narrowest available filters .    for dimmer sources , non - redundant masks such as those described above did not transmit enough flux to overcome the array readout noise .",
    "the use of partially - redundant annular masks , as suggested by haniff & buscher ( 1992 ) , provides continuous fourier plane coverage and enhanced throughput at the expense of only twofold redundancy .",
    "this approach has been adopted here .",
    "an example of such a mask with a throughput of approximately 10% is shown in figure  [ mask_ps ] , together with a short exposure interferogram and its power spectrum . for sources with k magnitudes fainter than about 4mag , the snr from masking interferometry was dominated by readout noise , undermining the advantages offered by sparse pupils and necessitating the use of the full pupil .",
    "one unusual feature of our non - redundant golay masks is that they allowed measurements of interference fringes that were sub - nyquist sampled . as mentioned in section",
    "[ optics ] , the pixel scale of nirc only allowed for nyquist sampling of the longest available baselines at wavelengths greater than 2@xmath5 m . at shorter wavelengths , power at the corresponding spatial frequencies",
    "is `` aliased '' back into the power spectrum at lower spatial frequencies , and in most experiments , this signal will overlap and become confused with other shorter baseline signals . with the sparse pupils used here ,",
    "however , these aliased signals were often mapped back onto otherwise unsampled frequencies and so measurements of the long baseline interference signals could still be made . in practice ,",
    "the undersampling attenuated the signals significantly , and the recovery of useful data was only possible in cases where the signal - to - noise was initially very high .",
    "nevertheless , we have used this device to recover the j band visibility functions of a handful of the brightest supergiants and miras at the highest spatial frequencies where the fringes were sub - nyquist sampled .",
    "in view of the close relationship between aperture masking and conventional filled aperture speckle interferometry , observations were secured using a schedule very similar to that used in other high resolution imaging experiments ( see , e.g. matthews et al .",
    "1996 ) . for each target 100",
    "short exposure interferograms were collected , after which a smaller number ( usually 10 ) of identical exposures were secured on nearby blank sky .",
    "the exposure times were limited by the array readout , with times of 140ms possible for the full @xmath9 nirc array .",
    "this is longer than the typical atmospheric coherence time ( @xmath10 ) expected at @xmath11@xmath5 m ( @xmath12ms ) resulting in added atmospheric noise for the bispectral measurements .",
    "however , integration times of a few @xmath10 preserve significant fringe power and actually deliver higher snr in the photon - noise limited ( faint source ) regime @xcite , while the closure phase is even more robust and can be measured with integrations of many @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "shorter exposure times could be obtained by reading out smaller sub - frames of the array , but in general the large sizes of the interferograms , resulting from the small dimensions of the pupil sub - apertures , meant that sub - framing was problematic for reasons of data calibration and loss of field of view .",
    "calibration of the mean telescope - atmosphere transfer function was performed by interleaving the 100source  +  10sky datasets with identical exposures of nearby similarly bright calibrator stars .",
    "sets of these  matched pairs \" of data were secured for each source and wavelength of interest , giving a total elapsed time for each complete observation of order ten minutes .",
    "currently this time remains limited by the @xmath410% duty cycle of the real - time archiving software available at nirc , which was not designed with this mode of operation in mind : custom designed hardware would likely increase the data collection rate by an order of magnitude . despite the low duty cycle of the camera , the use of non - redundant pupils allowed high - signal - to - noise image reconstructions of resolved targets to be achieved with relatively small numbers of specklegrams ( i.e.  as few as a hundred ) .",
    "this should be contrasted with the thousands typically used in filled - aperture speckle experiments where the atmospheric redundancy noise limits the signal - to - noise per frame of the fourier measurements to unity even at high light levels .",
    "where possible , filter bandpasses of @xmath13% were used in order to minimize the effects of the expected differences in spectral type between the targets and their calibrator stars . without such precautions ,",
    "the differing spectral shapes over the bandpass could affect the calibrated data .",
    "the most interesting sources  those with suspected well resolved structure  were observed at two well separated times during the night .",
    "this allowed independent checks to be made on the reliability of source structure determinations since spurious signals associated with the mask and detector array are not expected to rotate with the sky .",
    "additional observations were also secured each night of a number of binary stars with well determined orbits to allow independent calibration of the detector orientation and scale and to assess the reliability of the subsequent data reduction pipeline .",
    "analysis of the data followed standard methods for aperture masking experiments and involved the accumulation of the power spectra and bispectra of each set of interferograms .",
    "as a first step , each short exposure image was dark - subtracted , flat fielded , and cleaned of pattern noise arising from transients in the readout electronics and variations in the behavior of the four different readout amplifiers .",
    "images were subsequently windowed with a two - dimensional hanning function tapered to zero so as to eliminate edge effects .",
    "power spectra could now be computed frame by frame from the squared modulus of the fourier transform .",
    "stellar fringe signals appeared as power at discrete locations in such spectra , with the origin occupied by a peak whose height was proportional to the squared flux in the frame , while the remaining areas were filled with a signal caused by a combination of photon and readout noise ( for illustration , see figure  [ mask_ps ] ) .",
    "the noise power level , which would otherwise bias the measurements , could be obtained by averaging over those regions where no stellar signal was expected ( usually , but not always , at the edges of the power spectra ) .",
    "having subtracted off the noise bias , squared visibilities ( fourier amplitudes ) for the stellar interference signal were found by taking the ratio of the power at the spatial frequency of the fringes to the power at the origin , and then normalizing with the corresponding signal from the calibrator spectrum .",
    "error estimates were derived from the spread in values amongst each ensemble of 100 exposures .",
    "some typical results from this procedure are shown in figure  [ two_d_vis ] .",
    "fourier triple products , or bispectral data , could also be computed for each frame .",
    "closure phase information was recovered from the argument of the complex bispectral data accumulated over the ensembles of short exposures . again",
    "the measured closure phases for the reference stars were used to calibrate the measurements of the targets , however such corrections , indicative of optical aberrations in the telescope / camera , were small ( few degrees ) . unlike filled aperture speckle experiments",
    ", the use of an aperture mask ensured that only a very small subset of the full bispectral hypervolume needed to be accumulated dramatically reducing computational and data storage requirements .",
    "a standard workstation was adequate for all data processing .",
    "having obtained sets of calibrated fourier amplitudes and closure phases , diffraction - limited images were recovered using standard radio astronomical self - calibration methods .",
    "these techniques , originally developed for dilute phase - unstable radio arrays such as the vlba , are readily transferable to this application since our data , i.e.  sampled fourier amplitudes and closure phases , are almost identical to those delivered by arrays such as the vlba .",
    "the imaging results reported here were obtained using a `` maximum entropy method '' based implementation of self - calibration ( gull & skilling 1984 , sivia 1987 ) , but in all cases reconstructions from clean - based methods ( hgbom 1974 ) gave similar results . in many instances",
    "the extraction of quantitative information was achieved in a more robust and precise fashion from model - fitting directly to the fourier data than from mapping , particularly when source structure was relatively simple and/or partially resolved .",
    "since the success of interferometric imaging is critically dependent on the coherence properties of the incoming wavefront , experiments such as the ones reported here can in principle yield valuable information on the stability and aberrations introduced by mechanical deformation of the telescope , and by fluctuations in the atmosphere .",
    "the former of these is particularly relevant in consideration of the performance of the segmented primary mirror .",
    "quantitative investigations require a numerical simulation of the phase irregularities introduced by both the atmosphere and telescope pupil .",
    "although we have performed such computations , a full discussion of this work lies beyond the scope of the present report . instead , a number of general conclusions and difficulties experienced , some of which may be peculiar to the keck , are outlined below .",
    "the most obvious manifestation of optical aberrations related to the segmented primary is the loss of spectral power ( or fringe visibility ) , implying decorrelation of the wavefronts , at spatial frequencies which can be traced back to the locations of the edges of the hexagonal primary panels .",
    "this effect , sometimes referred to as `` print - through '' from the segmented pattern which appears in the power spectra , has also been seen by workers undertaking full - pupil speckle observations ( ghez 1997 ) .",
    "we have studied this effect in two ways .",
    "first , numerical simulations involving turbulence degraded wavefronts have verified that significant phase discontinuities ( 0.5@xmath14 ) at the segment boundaries do indeed result in a loss of spectral power which mimics the observations .",
    "second , experimental confirmation of this effect has been obtained by deliberately displacing selected mirror segments in small increments with respect to their neighbors .",
    "the overall finding of these studies is that between 1995 through 1997 , the keck  i primary was poorly phased when working in the infrared , with most segment edges exhibiting 0.5@xmath14 phase steps .",
    "this can probably be traced to sub - optimal performance of the `` malign '' alignment procedure . in 1997 , however , the primary mirror alignment procedures @xcite were refined and since then , phase distcontinuities , while still present , have been greatly ameliorated .",
    "a further problem we have experienced that is possibly related to the segmented primary concerns the anomalously low visibilities measured at long baselines . measured point - source visibilities were lower by a factor of 2@xmath43 than the values expected on the basis of numerical simulations .",
    "one likely candidate for this loss is the active control system responsible for maintaining the relative alignment between segments .",
    "significant oscillation or jitter of the system is known to occur ( wizinowich 1999 ) , which perturbs the segments at frequencies of tens of hertz  rapidly enough to blur the fringes and introduce a loss in visibility comparable to that we have observed .",
    "perhaps most damaging of the limitations encountered was the difficulty in ensuring the intermediate term ( @xmath410min ) stability of the optical transfer function necessary for reliable calibration of the measurements .",
    "mis - calibration effects , introduced where there had been a change in the seeing - averaged system transfer function between measurements of source and calibrator , were the major obstacle in recovering high fidelity image reconstructions .",
    "one can envisage many sources of this problem . without a doubt",
    ", changes in the local seeing could have occurred over the 4min time lag between source and calibrator observations .",
    "although the use of an aperture mask is known to limit the sensitivity of spatial interferometry to seeing variations , some mis - calibration must be traced to this .",
    "alternatively , any flexture of the telescope structure or changes in the phasing of the primary mirror could contribute to a non - stationary transfer function . in practice ,",
    "the reference stars used were invariably at different elevations in the sky ( worst cases could be greater than ten degrees away ) , and inevitable changes in the telescope wind loading and temperature all will have contributed to the difficulty of maintaining tolerances for interferometric observations . further work to identify and remedy this calibration problem would dramatically enhance the precision of this high spatial resolution experiment .",
    "observing in the near - infrared with the 10 m baselines available at the keck yields an angular resolution appropriate for large targets .",
    "the excellent snapshot fourier coverage of the telescope provides a densely sampled a stellar visibility function with orders of magnitude greater efficiency than a separated element array with a small number of stations .",
    "the ability to secure data rapidly and through a wide range of narrow bandpasses has been particularly useful for investigating the atmospheric structure of cool supergiants .",
    "stellar diameters are common science targets in high - angular resolution astrophysics ( see , e.g.  van belle et al .",
    "1999 for some recent results ) .",
    "figure  [ betelvis ] shows the azimuthally averaged visibility function of betelgeuse ( @xmath15  ori ) at four different wavelengths as measured in 1997 december .",
    "although a uniform disk model appears to be quite a good fit to the data at all the measured wavelengths , the star appears to exhibit an anomalously large diameter at @xmath16@xmath5 m ( @xmath17@xmath5 m ) , probably related to the presence of atomic or molecular absorption within the bandpass changing the optical depth of the stellar atmosphere .    in cases where the sources were significantly resolved",
    ", very high quality images could be obtained .",
    "figure  [ binaries ] shows maps of the binary stars 126  tau and @xmath15  com recovered from 100 interferograms . for both maps the dynamic range achieved , as measured by the ratio of the noise in the map to the peak intensity , was considerably better than 0.5% or 1:200 .",
    "the nonlinear contour levels in the plots of figure  [ binaries ] were chosen to highlight features at the level of the noise .",
    "the ultimate limitations to the dynamic range can be traced back to systematic miscalibration of the visibility amplitudes and poor handling of noise on the closure phases by the mapping software .",
    "insufficient fourier sampling and low signal flux ",
    "problems which are exacerbated by the use of a mask  were rarely an important contribution to the mapping error budget .",
    "more powerful arguments for the use of sparse pupil geometries in near infrared speckle imaging are provided by our results for complex resolved sources .",
    "figure  [ prettymaps ] shows two such images of the dust enshrouded carbon star , cit6 , and the ir - bright wolf - rayet star wr104 .",
    "both of the sources are clearly resolved at the tens of millarcsecond scale , and their complex structures , which have been confirmed through independent repeated observations ( see , e.g. , tuthill et al .",
    "1999b ) , demonstrate the unique facility that the combination of interferometric methods with the large keck primary provides .",
    "both maps have dynamic ranges better than 100:1 , and are of comparable quality to the images routinely produced by modern radio vlbi arrays",
    ". illustrations of the high level of repeatability for maps taken over separate epochs can be found in monnier et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "scientific results from the masking program at keck have encompassed a range of astronomical topics from measurements of stellar photospheres ( e.g. monnier et al .",
    "1997 ; tuthill monnier & danchi 1998b ; tuthill et al .",
    "2000 ) to imaging circumstellar dust shells in evolved stars ( e.g. tuthill et al .  1998a,1999c",
    "; danchi et al . 1998 ; monnier et al .",
    "1999a ) and enshrouded wolf - rayets ( tuthill et al .  1999b , c ; monnier tuthill & danchi 1999 ) .",
    "as is discussed further in monnier ( 1999 ) , the parameter space addressed by this experiment  bright objects ( @xmath18mag ) with resolvable structure on 10 m baselines  is a particularly rich one since the combined resolution and magnitude limits are fortuitously matched for targets containing hot astrophysical dust at around @xmath19k .",
    "further discussion of the program stars and techniques may be found in tuthill et al .",
    "( 1998c ) and monnier ( 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast to the situation only decades ago , astronomers are now armed with a number of different techniques all aimed at overcoming the seeing limit in astronomical observations .",
    "these include aperture masking , separate element interferometry , speckle interferometry , observations from space , and adaptive optics ( ao ) , with the distinctions between these areas becoming increasingly blurred .",
    "non - redundant , or partially - redundant masking occupies a particular niche in this parameter space , and has been successful for bright objects resolvable with relatively modest baselines .",
    "the primary competing technologies here are speckle interferometry and adaptive optics , which we discuss in turn below .",
    "although there has been much debate on the relative merits of masking versus speckle interferometry , there is agreement that for the faintest objects ( where `` faint '' is ultimately defined as a small number of photons in a coherent patch per coherence time , but in practice is usually governed by readout noise in the ir array detector before this limit is attained ) then speckle interferometry is the superior choice . for bright sources ,",
    "there is little doubt that masking offers dramatic signal - to - noise advantages for discrete measurements of fourier amplitudes and closure phases ( e.g. roddier 1987 ) .",
    "however , filled - pupil speckle interferometry is capable of recovering far greater volumes of data , completely filling the bispectral volume , albeit at low signal - to - noise .",
    "a number of studies have addressed the comparison of non - redundant versus filled pupil from theoretical , numerical simulation , and observational approaches @xcite , and have concluded that there are clear regions where masking can outperform filled - pupil techniques in recovering diffraction limited images of arbitrary celestial objects . in practice",
    ", superb images have been recovered using both techniques ( for examples of recent speckle images , see weigelt et al .",
    "a choice of which technique should be used is often also driven by more mundane considerations , which in our case included saturation of the camera on bright stars and the availability of a well characterized and mature image reconstruction code , both of which favor a masking strategy .    in making a comparison of the relative merits of adaptive optics a separate set of considerations present themselves .",
    "many of the masking program stars , in addition to being bright , also exhibit a compact core and therefore might be thought ideal targets for natural guide - star adaptive optical systems .",
    "however , a strong note of caution needs to be sounded against the optimistic projection that such systems will render post - processing techniques such as masking or speckle rapidly obsolete .",
    "obtaining true diffraction - limited images from current ao data requires careful deconvolution of the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "it has been our experience @xcite that the psf of an ao system is difficult to fully characterize , and worse , is not stationary when the telescope is moved to a calibration star which will usually be of different brightness , elevation and spectrum . in his recent review of ao , ridgway ( 1999 )",
    "notes that the problem of erratic psf artifacts , which can easily masquerade as genuine source structure , is endemic to current - generation ao systems . for all its unappealing appearance",
    ", an uncompensated speckle cloud has the advantage that it results from simpler underlying processes  the atmosphere and telescope optics only  with the result that ( in the high light limit ) it is easier to calibrate .",
    "we hasten to point out that ao offers numerous and dramatic advantages across a wide spectrum of observational problems ( e.g. ridgway 1999 ) ; our discussion here is limited only to bright stars with structure at the highest angular resolutions .",
    "results from the first aperture masking experiment performed on a 10 m class telescope are presented . a suitable choice of non- or",
    "low - redundancy pupil geometries has been found to dramatically improve the signal - to - noise on recovered bispectral data .",
    "reliable images with complex and asymmetric structure at the diffraction limit have been routinely produced in the near - infrared jhk and l bands . with dynamic ranges in excess of 200:1 , and demonstrated repeatability of map structure over multiple observing epochs , the expected advantages of sparse - aperture interferometry for bright targets have been confirmed . in a comparison of aperture",
    "masking , full - pupil speckle , and adaptive optics , the most reasonable conclusion appears that each technique has regions of the parameter space of source - brightness and spatial structure where it offers superior performance .",
    "the existence of such complementary observational techniques will certainly be beneficial in addressing a range of problems in high resolution astronomy , with masking being at its most effective for the brightest objects at the highest angular resolutions .",
    "the robust reconstruction of complex brightness distributions from sparsely sampled fourier data augers well for the future of the next generation of separate - element ground - based imaging arrays with baselines in excess of an order of magnitude larger than those available here .",
