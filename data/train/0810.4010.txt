    "@xcite discovered the first group of b - type hot subdwarf ( sdb ) pulsators , which they termed ec14026 after the prototype and are now designated as v361hya stars , and referred to as sdbv stars .",
    "this discovery opened the possibility of constraining the interiors of sdb stars through asteroseismology , which , in turn , may help to better understand their still controversial evolution .",
    "so far , about 40 class members have been found , with periods ranging from 60 to 600s and typical amplitudes of 10mmag , with some exceptions of higher amplitudes up to 60mmag .",
    "theoretical studies by @xcite demonstrated that their oscillations could be explained by acoustic ( @xmath1- ) modes of low degree , @xmath6 , and low radial orders , @xmath11 , driven by an opacity bump caused by a local enhancement of iron - group elements .    in 2002 another class of pulsating sdb stars was found @xcite .",
    "the new class is characterised by lower amplitudes ( 12mmag ) and longer periods ( @xmath81hour ) .",
    "the new variable stars are referred to as long - period sdbs , or pg1716 stars , after that prototype .",
    "@xcite determined that their variability could be explained in terms of high radial order gravity ( @xmath0- ) modes .",
    "the same @xmath12 mechanism that operates in v361  hya stars also works in pg1716 stars , although theoretical unstable modes were at slightly lower effective temperatures than observed .",
    "@xcite , using op opacity tables and considering an enhancement of both iron and nickel in the driving zone , were able to obtain unstable modes at the same effective temperatures as the observed ones",
    ". additionally , their non - adiabatic analysis led to simultaneous instability of @xmath1- and @xmath0-modes , which can account for the two known hybrid sdb pulsators .",
    "the two classes ( v361  hya and pg1716 stars ) of pulsating sdbs have slightly different effective temperatures and surface gravities , the former being hotter and denser than the latter .",
    "their pulsating behaviour resembles two other pairs of pulsating stars showing @xmath1- and @xmath0-modes : @xmath13 cephei and slowly pulsating b stars and @xmath14 scuti and @xmath15 doradus stars .",
    "balloon090100001 ( hereafter bal09 ) is one of the brightest pulsating sdb stars discovered to date .",
    "it was found to be an sdb star by @xcite , and a short - period pulsating sdb by @xcite .",
    "it has relatively long periods and large amplitudes of oscillation , which makes this object an excellent candidate for follow - up photometry .",
    "bal09 was observed in a long - time base campaign independently by two of us , in august and september 2004 using the 60-cm telescope at mt .",
    "suhora observatory ( ab ) and the 80-cm iac80 telescope at tenerife ( ro ) . four wide - band filters , @xmath2 , were used in the former ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bar05 ) , while only @xmath3-filter data were obtained in the latter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ore05 ) .",
    "the use of a common filter allowed an analysis of the combined data , from which almost 50 frequencies were detected @xcite .",
    "these campaigns revealed a rich spectrum of frequencies clustering in groups within the @xmath1-mode domain , and having lower amplitudes as the frequency increases .",
    "a high - amplitude frequency ( @xmath860mmag ) dominates the spectrum , with an equally - spaced triplet nearby . assuming that the triplet splitting is caused by rotation , a rotational period near 7days was derived .",
    "interestingly , variability near 4mmag was also detected in the low - frequency region , which is typical for pg1716 stars .",
    "thus , bal09 turned out to be a hybrid object and became very interesting from the seismological point of view .",
    "the star was the second hybrid sdb pulsator discovered , the first being hs0702 + 6043 @xcite , which shows a single frequency in the @xmath0-mode region .",
    "despite the frequency resolution achieved with the 2004 observations , the spectrum of bal09 suffered from strong aliasing , hindering a clear frequency identification at lower amplitudes .",
    "closely - spaced frequencies and/or amplitude variability made the situation even worse .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ models ]      in fig .",
    "[ esquemap ] a schematic spectrum of bal09 in the @xmath1-mode domain is presented . as can be seen , all @xmath1-modes except @xmath16 cluster in four narrow ( from 0.05 to 0.12 mhz wide ) frequency groups near 2.8 , 3.8 , 4.7 and 5.5 mhz , consisting of 9 , 22 , 24 , and 16 frequencies , respectively ( table [ a_fi_2005 ] ) .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath16.,width=313 ]    using combined multicolour photometry and spectroscopy of bal09 , @xcite identified @xmath7 as a radial mode and constrained the @xmath6 value for the 2.825mhz triplet components and @xmath9 . for a complete identification of @xmath7 , its radial order ( @xmath11 ) needs to be determined . assuming that @xmath7 is the fundamental radial mode ( @xmath6 = 0 , @xmath11 = 1 ) and using the grid of sdb models of @xcite , bar05 came to a reasonably good agreement between the observed frequency and the location of bal09 in the @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 diagram ( see fig .  13 in bar05 ) .",
    "the first overtone was not regarded as an alternative for @xmath7 by bar05 , however .",
    "let us consider such a case .",

    "model periods can be matched within the spectroscopic @xmath17 and @xmath21 constraints only if slightly more massive models than those of @xcite are considered , e.g.  some models on sequence a in fig .  [ dhr ] .",
    "we can also find an appropriate model if we assume that @xmath7 is the second radial overtone , though the match is worse . in this case",
    "@xmath19 equals to 593  s. however , all models of a given @xmath19 have nearly the same value of @xmath17 .",
    "this can be explained as the period of the fundamental radial mode depends primarily on average density , i.e. , stellar radius . for a set of models that do not differ very much in mass",
    "this implies that models with the same pulsation period would have approximately the same @xmath17 .",
    "this can be seen , for example , in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "13 of bar05 . as the spectroscopic error box for @xmath17 and @xmath21 is still quite large ( fig .",
    "[ dhr ] ) we can not constrain @xmath11 for @xmath7 since both the fundamental and first overtone are allowable , and even the second overtone can not be excluded .",
    "while only higher overtones can be rejected , we can constrain @xmath17 for our three possibilities to 5.51 ( @xmath7 fundamental ) , 5.34 ( 1st overtone ) , or 5.22 ( 2nd overtone ) .",
    "improved constraints on @xmath17 will distinguish between these three possibilities .",
    "however , we prefer to assume that @xmath7 is the fundamental radial pulsation as this is the most likely possibility . if @xmath7 were the first overtone then the fundamental radial pulsation ( and also some non - radial @xmath1 modes with similar frequencies ) should occur near 2.1  mhz and these pulsations are not observed .    .",
    "two sets of models were used : ( i ) those described in section [ ev_models ] and listed in table [ models ] ( large symbols ) , ( ii ) the sequences 5 to 7 from @xcite ( small symbols ) .",
    "three horizontal strips denote the observed ranges of frequency ratios . all modes from @xmath1-mode groups near 3.8",
    ", 4.7 and 5.5  mhz are considered.,width=313 ]    another argument in favour of @xmath7 as the fundamental radial mode is the overtone ratio .",
    "if we assume that at least one mode in the 3.8mhz group is also radial then the overtone ratio is 2.807mhz/(3.774@xmath223.841)mhz @xmath20 0.731@xmath220.744 which can be compared with theoretical ratios , as is done in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] .",
    "it can be seen that for most models the @xmath23 ratio is near to 0.74 and only for model c is also @xmath24 allowed in some of its evolutionary phases .",
    "the latter case implies @xmath7 to be the first overtone . as such",
    ", we can conclude that if any of the 3.8  mhz - region frequencies are radial , then @xmath7 is most likely the fundamental radial pulsation . additionally , fig .",
    "[ ratios ] indicates that by choosing @xmath7 to be the fundamental radial mode , the 4.7  mhz and 5.5  mhz groups match overtone ratios for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it seems unlikely that such a good match is serendipitous . reversing this reasoning",
    "we may therefore conclude that each of the groups of @xmath1-modes in bal09 may contain a radial mode ( if so , we know which overtone it is ) .",
    "alternatively , the same could be true for consecutive overtones of non - radial modes as they have period ratios similar to the radial ones , unless when avoided crossing occurs .",
    "modes : near 2.8 , 3.8 , 4.7 , and 5.5  mhz.,width=313 ]    considering splittings , we have searched for additional multiplets using the same frequency spacing as observed for multiplets at 2.8  mhz .",
    "because of the high frequency density in these regions , there are likely rotationally split multiplets",
    ". however , the simple structure of frequencies in the 2.8mhz group contrasts with more complicated frequency patterns in the three remaining groups of @xmath1-mode frequencies ( fig .  [ pattern ] ) .",
    "another likely multiplet is the symmetric triplet of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( table [ a_fi_2005 ] ) with splittings of 1.440 @xmath30 0.021 and 1.446 @xmath30 0.023  @xmath5hz .",
    "bearing in mind the richness of the spectrum , observed amplitude variations , and uncertainties caused by aliasing , we prefer not to speculate further on additional multiplets until better data more fully reveal the frequency spectrum .",
    "the high frequency density also indicates that all groups of @xmath1-modes must have @xmath31 2 modes , except those in the 2.8  mhz region .",
    "bal09 shows a very rich spectrum in the low - frequency domain , which theoretically corresponds to @xmath0-modes . in fig .",

    "theoretical frequencies of a representative sdb model in sequence c are also shown .",
    "we did not intend to find a model which matches the observed frequencies , but just to compare the density of theoretical and observed frequencies in this region . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ schemodosg ] , at least @xmath6 = 1 and 2 modes are needed to account for the observed frequencies .",
    "however , as the density of theoretical frequencies increases with @xmath6 , the observed spectrum would be better reproduced if higher degree modes were considered .",
    "-modes with @xmath6 = 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the latter are shown for a representative sdb model from sequence c. numbers on the right indicate the value of @xmath11 for the first @xmath0-mode below 1  mhz.,width=313 ]    we also notice a lack of frequencies between 0.4 and 0.6mhz .",
    "either they have amplitudes below our detection threshold or they are not excited .",
    "we investigate the possibility that they are not excited and show in fig .",
    "[ trabajo ] the derivative of the work integral ( @xmath32 ) for @xmath0-modes with @xmath6 = 2 and radial orders @xmath33 = 1 , 7 and 30 .",
    "these modes were chosen as representative of low , intermediate and high radial orders .",
    "we used the graco non - adiabatic code @xcite to compute @xmath32 , which is positive in regions contributing to driving oscillations , while negative in damping regions .",
    "for hot b subdwarfs the driving zone is related to the iron - peak elements opacity bump . in fig .",
    "[ trabajo ] , the rosseland mean opacity for theoretical model c used is plotted as a solid line .",
    "[ trabajo ] shows also that , while the region of the bump ( shown in gray ) contributes to the excitation of low- and high - radial order @xmath0-modes ( @xmath34 0 there ) , it has a negligible effect in driving intermediate - radial order modes .",
    "this result could support the hypothesis that @xmath0-modes with intermediate radial orders are not excited in bal09 .",
    "non - adiabatic computations by @xcite also result in exciting low- and high - order @xmath0-modes but damping intermediate ones for some models .",
    "this seems a reasonable explanation for the lack of observed frequencies between 0.4 and 0.6mhz .",
    "theoretical @xmath0-modes with low radial orders can have frequencies up to @xmath82.3mhz ( not shown in fig .  [ schemodosg ] ) .",
    "we detect three frequencies ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) between 1.8 and 2.3  mhz which could then be attributed to low radial order @xmath0-modes .",
    "= 2 , @xmath11 = @xmath381 , @xmath387 , and @xmath3830 @xmath0-modes as a function of a fractional stellar radius for a representative model from sequence c. regions contributing to driving ( damping ) produce positive ( negative ) @xmath32 values . the rosseland mean opacity is included as a solid line and plotted in arbitrary units .",
    "the gray area delimits the driving region associated with an iron - group opacity bump.,width=313 ]    most @xmath0-modes observed have periods in the range between 2500 and 7200s , although a few extend this range to 120010300s . theoretical @xmath0-modes with @xmath6 = 13 and periods in the range 25007200s ( fig .  [ schemodosg ] )",
    "have radial orders in the range @xmath33 @xmath81180 , which extends to @xmath39 = 5115 , if we include all of the observed periods .",
    "with high - radial orders , we can expect asymptotic behaviour which results in equally - spaced periods @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have shown that sdbs might display trapped @xmath0-modes , mainly caused by the chemical transition between the he and h radiative layers in the envelope .",
    "mode trapping causes some periods to move away from asymptotic behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ deltag ] , we show a schematic @xmath0-mode spectrum _ in periods _ and indicate the differences ( in seconds ) between adjacent periods",
    ". however , the observed period spectrum does not appear equally spaced , which suggests that some @xmath11 orders were not detected or excited . fig .",
    "[ schemodosg ] also shows that the density of theoretical periods is much higher than the observed density , even if only periods with @xmath40  3 are considered .",
    "-mode spectrum _ in periods _ of bal09 .",
    "period distances between adjacent modes are indicated with numbers expressed in seconds.,width=313 ]    we searched for equally - spaced periods using different techniques . while we could produce some reasonable alignments in echelle diagrams ( e.g.  for period spacing @xmath41 286s )",
    ", the results are not convincing .",
    "if mode trapping is effective , we should not expect good alignment from an echelle diagram .",
    "a way around this problem would be to fine - tune models using the @xmath1-modes and then search the @xmath0-modes for periodicities , or even match their periods directly to the model ones .",
    "if some @xmath0-modes could be identified , it could greatly increase our understanding of sdb interiors .",
    "the 2005 campaign on bal09 was carried out because the object is one of the most interesting pulsating sdb stars .",
    "it has high - amplitude oscillations , it is one of the brightest sdb pulsators ( @xmath3 = 11.8 mag ) , and it has the richest pulsation spectrum of both @xmath1- and @xmath0-modes .",
    "the 2005 campaign led to the discovery of nearly a hundred independent frequencies ( table [ a_fi_2005 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we showed that , like in many other sdbv stars @xcite , amplitudes of many modes in bal09 vary and the time scale of these changes is as short as several weeks .",
    "the 2005 data also allowed the detection of all components of the quintuplet .",
    "this was possible because of the low detection threshold of @xmath80.2mma in the @xmath42 data , which also resulted in the detection of a large number of frequencies , especially near 3.8 and 4.7mhz . even if some of them turn out to be non - axisymmetric multiplets , the frequency density is such that at least some of them must have @xmath31 2 .",
    "the most surprising result of this campaign is the discovery of a considerable change of splittings in two multiplets ( a triplet and quintuplet ) which are believed to be rotationally split @xmath6 = 1 and 2 modes . as far as we are aware , this is the first clear detection of such a change of splitting in any pulsating star .",
    "the presence of multiplets is usually attributed to rotation of the star , causing the @xmath43 degeneracy to be broken .",
    "two clear multiplets are detected in bal09 : a @xmath6 = 1 triplet at 2.82mhz and a @xmath6 = 2 quintuplet at 2.85mhz .",
    "the structure of the quintuplet is especially interesting .",
    "its components , all of which are detected in 2005 , form a symmetric but not equidistant pattern .",
    "specifically , the mean separation between @xmath44 = 2 and @xmath44 = 1 components ( 2.100 @xmath30 0.014@xmath5hz ) is considerably larger than the mean separation between @xmath44 = 1 components and the central peak of the quintuplet ( 1.577 @xmath30 0.007@xmath5hz ) .",
    "the same was true in 2004 .",
    "such a pattern can not be produced by a solid body rotation , nor even by a spherically symmetric rotation , @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , in both these cases splitting within a multiplet is , in the limit of slow rotation , proportional to @xmath43 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , components of the multiplet have to be equidistant .",
    "this is not what we observe .",
    "thus , the observed structure of @xmath6 = 2 quintuplet implies that rotation rate of bal09 must depend on the stellar latitude , @xmath46 .",
    "additional information can be inferred from comparison of rotational splitting for @xmath44 = 2 and for @xmath44 = 1 .",
    "because of its spacial structure , modes of @xmath44 = 2 are most sensitive to equatorial rotation of the star , while modes of @xmath44 = 1 sense mostly rotation in the intermediate latitudes . the observed splitting is larger for @xmath44 = 2 , which implies that rotation of bal09 is fastest on the equator .",
    "this has to be true at least in a large part of the star s envelope .",
    "qualitatively , this dependence on @xmath46 is similar to that inferred for the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most puzzling result of 2005 campaign is the detection of changing rotational splittings .",
    "both in the triplet and in the quintuplet the separation of components is much wider in 2005 than in 2004 .",
    "the differences range from 12% for @xmath6 = 2 @xmath44 = 1 to 16% for @xmath6 = 2 @xmath44 = 2 .",
    "similar behaviour of both multiplets puts strong constraint on any theoretical explanation of the observed effect .",
    "for example , it excludes internal 1:1 resonances within the multiplets @xcite .",
    "such a coupling could modulate the separation of multiplet components , but it would act in each multiplet independently , giving no explanation why they all change in the same way .",
    "simultaneous widening of both multiplets must be caused by a common mechanism , which affects the structure of the star .",
    "taken at the face value , widening of multiplets in bal09 would imply a considerable change of its internal rotation , occurring in just one year . at first glance",
    "this seems to be a very far fetched hypothesis .",
    "however , variations of internal stellar rotation on time scale of a few years are not unheard of .",
    "such variations are actually observed in the sun @xcite .",
    "these so - called torsional oscillations cause periodic changes of the solar rotation pattern with the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "the cause of torsional oscillations in the sun is not clear , although several hypotheses have been put forward @xcite .",
    "we must note that the internal structure of bal09 and the sun is very different .",
    "in contrast to the sun , the envelope of an sdb star is almost entirely radiative , with the exception of an extremely thin convective layer associated with the heii ionisation zone @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of convection is not necessary to drive torsional oscillations in the star , as they can be excited by interaction between differential rotation and magnetic field @xcite . in this mechanism ,",
    "differential rotation and the toroidal component of the field exchange energy , causing periodic redistribution of angular momentum inside the star .",
    "this in turn , leads to periodic changes of rotational splittings .",
    "according to @xcite , strong differential rotation is what we expect in envelope of every sdb star .",
    "the magnetic field in bal09 has not yet been measured , but observations of several other sdb stars reveal fields of @xmath81.5 kg @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of torsional oscillations discovered in the sun is rather small , of the order of @xmath3011.5% of the local rotation velocity .",
    "this is amount too small to account for changes in multiplet splittings as large as those observed in bal09 .",
    "torsional oscillations in bal09 have to be at least an order of magnitude stronger than in the sun . whether torsional oscillations in bal09 can be driven to such amplitudes",
    "remains an open question until detailed model calculations become available .",
    "these results indicate that bal09 may be a key object in our understanding of pulsations in sdbv stars and its variability is definitely worth further study .",
    "first , the changes of splittings should be monitored on a longer time scale as this may help to understand their origin .",
    "the same is true for amplitude changes .",
    "next , as the amplitudes change so distinctly , it may happen that modes undetectable in one season will become visible in the other , thus allowing to a complete spectrum of excited modes .",
    "finally , the observed frequencies should be compared to a larger grid of models using identifications of the strongest frequencies as done in @xcite .",
    "such constrained modes should result in constraining global stellar parameters for bal09 and reveal its internal structure .",

    "<S> we present the results of a multisite photometric campaign on the pulsating sdb star balloon090100001 . </S>",
    "<S> the star is one of the two known hybrid hot subdwarfs with both long- and short - period oscillations , theoretically attributed to @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes . </S>",
    "<S> the campaign involved eight telescopes with three obtaining @xmath2 data , four @xmath3-band data , and one strmgren @xmath4 photometry . </S>",
    "<S> the campaign covered 48 nights , providing a temporal resolution of 0.36@xmath5hz with a detection threshold of about 0.2mmag in @xmath3-filter data .    </S>",
    "<S> balloon090100001 has the richest pulsation spectrum of any known pulsating subdwarf b star and our analysis detected 114 frequencies including 97 independent and 17 combination ones . </S>",
    "<S> most of the 24 @xmath0-mode frequencies are between 0.1 and 0.4mhz . of the remaining 73 , </S>",
    "<S> presumably @xmath1-modes , 72 group into four distinct regions near 2.8 , 3.8 , 4.7 and 5.5mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the density of frequencies requires that some modes must have degrees @xmath6 larger than 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the modes in the 2.8  mhz region have the largest amplitudes . the strongest mode ( @xmath7 ) </S>",
    "<S> is most likely radial while the remaining ones in this region form two nearly symmetric multiplets : a triplet and quintuplet , attributed to rotationally split @xmath6 = 1 and 2 modes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find clear increases of splitting in both multiplets between the 2004 and 2005 observing campaigns , amounting to @xmath815% on average . </S>",
    "<S> the observed splittings imply that the rotational rate in bal09 depends on stellar latitude and is the fastest on the equator . </S>",
    "<S> we also speculate on the possible reasons for the changes of splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the only plausible explanation we find are torsional oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis , however , need to be verified in the future by detailed modelling . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , it is very important to monitor the splittings on a longer time scale as their behaviour may help to explain this interesting phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of almost all terms detected both in 2004 and 2005 were found to vary . </S>",
    "<S> this is evident even during one season ; for example , amplitudes of modes @xmath9 and @xmath10 were found to change by a factor of 23 within about 50 days during 2005 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a small grid of models to constrain the main mode ( @xmath7 ) , which most likely represents the radial fundamental pulsation . </S>",
    "<S> the groups of @xmath1-mode frequencies appear to lie in the vicinity of consecutive radial overtones , up to the third one . </S>",
    "<S> despite the large number of @xmath0-mode frequencies observed , we failed to identify them , most likely because of the disruption of asymptotic behaviour by mode trapping . </S>",
    "<S> the observed frequencies were not , however , fully exploited in terms of seismic analysis which should be done in the future with a larger grid of reliable evolutionary models of hot subdwarfs .    </S>",
