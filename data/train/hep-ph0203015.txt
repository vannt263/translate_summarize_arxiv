    "@xmath0 scattering is ideally suited for studying the origins of the nonresonant  nuclear \" force .",
    "conventional s - channel baryon resonance production is excluded because there is no valence annihilation , and one - pion exchange is forbidden because there is no three - pseudoscalar vetex .",
    "we may therefore study the nonresonant part of hadron scattering in relative isolation , uncomplicated by one - pion exchange . in this work",
    "we calculate @xmath0 phase shifts at born order in a quark exhange model with one gluon exchange ( oge ) and linear scalar confinement .",
    "the dominant hyperfine term has given very good results in s - wave for i=2 @xmath3 [ 1 ] , i=3/2 @xmath4 [ 2 ] , i=1 @xmath5[1 ] , @xmath0 [ 3 ] , and short - ranged @xmath6 [ 4 ] scattering .",
    "here we include the spin - orbit and subdominant spin - independent contributions , and give results for higher - l waves .",
    "@xmath0 scattering is an excellent place to test our model since data exists and there is a large spin - orbit effect , especially evident in the p - waves .",
    "understanding the spin - orbit effect here will be important for applications to other hadronic interactions , such as @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath0 scattering is almost entirely elastic below @xmath7 threshold , and the born approximation is expected to be relevant since the interaction is known experimentally to be relatively weak .",
    "there are some basic experimental features of @xmath0 scattering which are generally agreed upon .",
    "the i=1 channel is relatively well determined from @xmath8 scattering .",
    "using the conventional @xmath9 notation , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels are repulsive and the @xmath12 channel is attractive . i=0 is more in doubt because of inherent difficulties in the experimental analysis . the i=0 @xmath0 scattering amplitudes have been extracted from @xmath13 scattering , using models of the deuteron breakup process and form factors .",
    "it is clear , however , that the @xmath14 channel is strongly attractive ( in fact anomalously so ) .",
    "inelasticities are known to be large above inelastic thresholds , in particular in the @xmath14 wave . for reference ,",
    "@xmath7 ( i=1 @xmath0 only ) opens at @xmath15  gev , @xmath16 opens at @xmath17  gev and @xmath18 opens at a much higher @xmath19  gev .",
    "the fundamental interactions in qcd are between quark and gluon constituents .",
    "the quark - quark oge @xmath20 is derived as the nonrelativistic reduction to order @xmath21 of the feynman amplitude for two quarks to exchange a gluon with phenomenological strength @xmath22 .",
    "the result is the usual breit - fermi hamiltonian , which is well known from atomic physics , and includes the dominant spin - spin hyperfine interaction as well as coulomb , spin - orbit , tensor , and subdominant spin - independent contributions .",
    "the confining interaction is modelled as a linear scalar interaction with strength b ( the string tension ) between a pair of quarks , and yields linear and spin - orbit contributions , as well as smaller spin - independent terms .",
    "the quark - quark interaction is followed by quark interchange , so that the outgoing hadrons emerge as color singlets [ 5 ] .",
    "the scattering arises from the interactions between quarks in different hadrons , and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 is the sum of quark - quark interactions between all such pairs of quarks .",
    "to born order the scattering amplitude is given by the matrix element of @xmath23 between external hadron states , which ideally should be eigenstates of the respective free hamiltonians .",
    "we approximate the true wavefunctions by gaussian forms for calculational simplicity , as these lead to analytical results for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this approximation has been tested in previous calculations [ 6 ] .",
    "the parameters are relatively well determined from quark - model phenomenology ; we use a reasonably standard set ( below ) for our numerical evaluation . @xmath24",
    "the phase shifts are calculated from the scattering amplitudes and phase space factors in the usual way [ 6 ] .",
    "hashimoto [ 7 ] has performed the most recent comprehensive single - energy phase shift analysis we are aware of , and we take his data for comparison . we also compare our results with those of the recent resonating group method ( rgm ) calculation of lemaire , . in the i=1 channel ,",
    "our results are in reasonable agreement with the rgm calculation .",
    "both calculations agree at least qualitatively with the data except in the @xmath12 wave , for which they both give the wrong sign . in i=0 ,",
    "the absolute values of the calculated phase shifts are in general too small , especially in the remarkably large @xmath14 wave .",
    "the oge spin - orbit contributions to our quark model @xmath0 phase shifts are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the large @xmath14 amplitude evident there is perhaps an indication that we have included at least some of the correct physics .",
    "it is , however , not large enough by itself to account for the data , and is partially cancelled by the confinement spin - orbit contribution and the negative spin - spin hyperfine term .",
    "mukhopadhyay and pirner [ 9 ] have found that the phase shifts calculated from the symmetric part of the oge spin - orbit interaction agree reasonably well with the experimental phase shifts at low energies except in the @xmath14 wave , which they seriously underestimate .",
    "the antisymmetric part of the oge spin - orbit interaction is omitted in their calculation because it gives rise to large splittings in the baryon spectroscopy which are not observed .",
    "they similarly conclude that the confinement spin - orbit interaction partially cancels the oge spin - orbit contribution , and the inclusion of the spin - spin interaction actually makes the @xmath12 phase shift theoretically repulsive .",
    "the opening of inelastic channels is known to be a very large effect in the @xmath14 wave , and may be responsible for the large experimental phase shift .",
    "coupling to inelastic channels will be treated in a future calculation .",
    "knowledge of vacuum @xmath2 scattering amplitudes and observables is important for understanding open - charm hadronic interactions in hot , dense media , as occur in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we applied our @xmath0 scattering model to obtain @xmath2 elastic phase shifts , which are shown in figure 4 .",
    "( the only new parameter was the charmed quark mass , taken to be @xmath25 gev . )",
    "inelasticities may well be large in @xmath2 , as in @xmath0 scattering . in i=1 ,",
    "the linear and spin - spin hyperfine terms are roughly comparable , and dominate scattering in the waves shown .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is small in comparison .",
    "it is noteable that in i=0 the spin - independent terms ( coulomb and linear ) are identically zero and the spin - orbit interactions dominate the scattering .",
    "6            one may wonder whether t - channel meson exchange should be included as a separate effect in the calculation .",
    "we note that our quark line diagrams are topologically @xmath26 exchanges in t - channel , and hence may implicitly incorporate t - channel meson exchange effects .",
    "the connection between the two pictures is an interesting topic for future research ."
