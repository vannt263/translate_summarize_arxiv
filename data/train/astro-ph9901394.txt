    "intense central star formation and possibly an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) are thought to be the energy sources responsible for the observed large ir luminosities in bright iras galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) where large amounts of molecular gas are found ( @xcite ) .",
    "an important problem in understanding the energetic phenomena occurring in the nuclear regions of such galaxies is determining the role of the molecular gas in fueling the agn and/or a central starburst .",
    "many of the very ir - luminous ( @xmath12 ) galaxies are found to be strongly interacting or merging systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "strong interactions between two galaxies , at least one of which is gas rich , may foster the rapid accumulation of large amounts of molecular gas in the nuclear regions ( @xcite ) where they can `` ignite '' a starburst and `` fuel '' an agn .",
    "for seyfert galaxies with more moderate fir luminosities ( @xmath13 ) the picture is less clear .",
    "earlier work by heckman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) suggested that the hosts of type 2 seyfert nuclei contain , on average , more molecular gas mass and have a larger fir luminosity and hence higher star forming activity than type 1 .",
    "more recent studies by maiolino et al .",
    "( 1997 ) of a larger and better defined sample of seyferts and field spirals confirms the higher fir luminosities of seyfert 2 s but casts some doubts on the purported difference in molecular gas mass between these galaxies and seyfert 1 s , or field spirals . in the same study",
    "preliminary evidence points towards bars , interactions and distorted morphologies as being present more frequently in the hosts of type 2 than in type 1 seyferts . in this case ,",
    "efficient molecular gas transport towards the nucleus will be present more often in former rather than the latter .",
    "hence , provided that this mechanism remains effective over scales ranging from @xmath14 kpc down to a few parsecs , it can naturally explain why the onset of a central starburst correlates with a higher probability of obscuring the broad line region of the agn .",
    "nevertheless such a scenario still can not explain a larger total molecular gas reservoir in seyfert 2 with respect to seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "however , since type 2 are more likely to harbor a central ( @xmath15 kpc ) starburst than seyfert 1 s ( maiolino 1995 ) , there exists the possibility that any difference in their average @xmath0co j=10 luminosities is caused by differences in the average excitation of the molecular gas rather than the total gas mass .",
    "ngc 1068 is the closest and best studied example of a luminous seyfert 2 galaxy which also harbors an intense starburst in its central @xmath162.5 kpc .",
    "it has a large bolometric luminosity of @xmath17 l@xmath18 roughly equally divided between the unresolved agn and the starburst disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of molecular gas is characterized by a nuclear concentration within the central 100 pc ( planesas , scoville & myers 1991 ; helfer & blitz 1995 ) where mostly dense gas ( @xmath19 ) resides ( jackson et al . 1993 ; tacconi et al . 1994 ; helfer & blitz 1995 ) and a more extended molecular gas distribution that coincides with the starburst region and consists of two inner spiral arms and a bar ( helfer & blitz 1995 ) .",
    "the nuclear component is thought to contribute to the built - up of an agn - obscuring molecular torus ( planesas et al .",
    "1991 ; cameron et al . 1994",
    "; tacconi et al . 1994 ) .",
    "in the present work we use this galaxy as a `` laboratory '' to study the excitation of the bulk of the molecular gas in the intense starburst environment of the host galaxy of a seyfert 2 nucleus . to do so we use our fully sampled maps of @xmath20co , @xmath21co j=32 , 21 acquired with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in combination with an existing interferometric @xmath20co j=10 map ( @xcite ) .",
    "resolution - matched observations of different rotational lines of @xmath22co and especially @xmath1co provide an excellent probe of the physical conditions in the bulk of the molecular gas .",
    "a ratio like ( 32)/(10 ) can be particularly sensitive to gas excitation conditions since the j=3 level lies 32 k above ground versus 5.5 k for j=1 while the j=32 transition has a significantly higher critical density ( @xmath23 @xmath24 ) than the j=10 transition ( @xmath25 @xmath24 ) in the optically thin regime .",
    "moreover the maps of the rare @xmath1co isotope allow the study of the molecular gas using less opaque lines than the ones of @xmath0co and therefore sensitive to the average conditions of a larger fraction of molecular material .    throughout this study",
    "we assume a distance to ngc 1068 of d=14 mpc ( sandage & tammann 1981 , @xmath26 km s@xmath27 ) for which 1@xmath28 corresponds to 68 pc .",
    "we used the receivers a2 , b3i and the newly commissioned receiver b3 on jcmt in several observing runs in order to produce fully sampled maps ( nyquist sampling ) of the emission lines @xmath0co , @xmath1co j=32 , 21 of the inner @xmath2 region of ngc 1068 .",
    "we also observed the very weak c@xmath8o j=21 transition in two points , the details of all our observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "editor : place table 1 here    the map center was located at @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the receiver was tuned to a velocity of @xmath31 km s@xmath27 . for more efficient mapping of the co emission ,",
    "the area mapped was along a rotated grid with @xmath32 .",
    "the grid - cell is an equilateral triangle with a size of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the hpbw of the gaussian beam .",
    "this grid provides the optimum coverage of the co - emitting region of ngc  1068 at a nyquist sampling and is uniquely determined by the demand of a )  a  uniform sampling pattern and , b ) every sampled point having the maximum number ( n=6 ) of the closest neighboring points at a distance of @xmath35 .",
    "we performed all our observations using beam switching with a beam throw of 150@xmath28 in azimuth at the recommended rate of 1 hz and only for the very weak c@xmath8o j=21 the rate was 2 hz in order to achieve a stable baseline .",
    "the pointing and focus were monitored frequently by observing bright quasars , planets and omc1 ( for @xmath1co j=32 ) .",
    "we converted the @xmath36 temperature scale of the jcmt spectra to the @xmath37 scale by using the relation @xmath38 .",
    "we performed measurements of @xmath39 for all the receivers by observing saturn ( a2 , b3i ) and jupiter ( b3 ) .",
    "we found excellent agreement ( within @xmath40 ) with the values reported in the jcmt manual ( matthews 1996 ) .",
    "the adopted beam efficiencies are @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the error associated with the line intensity measurements was estimated using the relation    @xmath44^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    the first two terms express the thermal rms error and the stochastic uncertainty of the calibration of the line intensities .",
    "the third term is the systematic uncertainty of the assumed telescope efficiency factors .",
    "if t is the main beam brightness temperature averaged over @xmath45 channels and @xmath46 is the total number of channels defining a symmetric baseline around the spectral line , then    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the thermal noise per channel .",
    "the calibration uncertainty factor was estimated from the dispersion of the observed intensities of many spectral line standards with high s / n , and it was found to be @xmath49 for all the observed frequencies .",
    "the third factor is @xmath50 for all frequencies ( friberg , sandell , private communication ) .",
    "finally we performed an additional check on the overall uncertainty of the line intensities by frequently monitoring the @xmath0co lines in some standard points of our map .",
    "for the weak @xmath1co lines we monitored the spectrum of omc1 at @xmath51 km s@xmath27 where various bright lines are still present . in all cases we found excellent agreement of the line profiles and a measured dispersion of line",
    "intensities consistent with the one estimated from the first two terms of equation 1 .",
    "the jcmt data were reduced using the specx reduction package .",
    "we smoothed all our spectra to a common velocity resolution of @xmath52 km s@xmath27 and removed linear baselines . in the case of the @xmath0co j=32 transition we also removed some bad channels that were present at the high velocity end of the band .",
    "the grid maps were interpolated by convolving them with a gaussian function . for the j=32 maps the fwhm of the interpolating function used",
    "was @xmath53 .",
    "the interpolated map has effective resolution of @xmath54^{1/2}=16''$ ] . for the j=21 grid maps we used @xmath55 and",
    "the effective resolution of the interpolated map is @xmath56^{1/2}\\sim 24''$ ] .",
    "the maps were further analyzed with the aips reduction package .",
    "the task hgeom was employed to re - grid the jcmt maps in order to re - orient them in an ( ra , dec ) grid .",
    "a check of the consistency of the interpolation and re - gridding was performed by comparing the area - averaged @xmath37 in individual channel maps between the original grid maps and the final ones used in our analysis .",
    "we found good agreement within the thermal rms uncertainties .",
    "the maps of the velocity - averaged main beam brightness @xmath57 for @xmath0co , @xmath1co are shown in figures 1 and 2 for the j=21 and 32 transitions respectively .",
    "the @xmath0co j=10 map used in our analysis was obtained by helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) interferometer and the nrao 12 m telescope .",
    "this map is the most suitable one for comparison with our jcmt maps since its combination of interferometer and single dish measurements recovers all the co flux .",
    "the interferometer map has been corrected for primary beam attenuation by assuming a gaussian profile with hpbw=100@xmath28 .",
    "we convolved the @xmath0co j=10 channel maps to a spatial resolution of 16@xmath28 and converted the original brightness units ( mjy / beam ) to the @xmath58 temperature scale in order to compare them to the @xmath0co j=32 map .",
    "the channel maps and the associated line ratio @xmath59 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the close correspondence of the @xmath0co j=32 and the @xmath0co j=10 emission in every channel demonstrates that no serious pointing offsets are present between the two maps .",
    "the estimated channel - to - channel rms dispersion of the @xmath60 ratio is of the order of @xmath61 .",
    "this includes only the thermal rms error since the other two sources of error for the jcmt maps ( equation 1 ) and the systematic calibration uncertainty in the flux conversion factor of the bima @xmath0co j=10 map are constant across the passband .",
    "the largest single source of error is the @xmath62 flux calibration uncertainty of the @xmath3co j=10 bima map .",
    "this results to a total uncertainty of @xmath63 for the @xmath64 ratio .",
    "the c@xmath8o j=21 spectra correspond to a spatial resolution of @xmath65 . in order to compare them to the @xmath1co spectra towards the same locations we used an interpolated @xmath1co j=21 map with @xmath66 , which gives an effective resolution of @xmath67 .",
    "the spectra , smoothed to a common frequency resolution of 25 mhz ( 34 km s@xmath27 ) are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the @xmath21co , @xmath3co j=21 and 32 maps ( figures 1 , 2 ) demonstrate that the relative intensities of these two isotopes change significantly across the emitting region .",
    "there is a significant increase of the intensity of @xmath1co relative to @xmath0co towards the location of the giant molecular gas associations ( gmas ) in the southern part of the central starburst region of ngc 1068 .",
    "these molecular gas concentrations show up in high resolution maps ( planesas , scoville & myers 1991 ; helfer & blitz 1995 ) as high brightness regions with large inferred h@xmath68 surface densities .",
    "especially large variations of @xmath0co/@xmath1co are observed for the j=10 transition ( helfer & blitz 1995 ; papadopoulos , seaquist & scoville 1996 ) .",
    "large variations of this ratio have been recently reported by aalto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the extreme starburst / merger system arp 299 where high resolution interferometric measurements indicate changes by a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath64 ratio also shows a large range of values in the various regions in the inner 3  kpc of ngc 1068 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the lowest values @xmath70 occur towards the eastern part of the emission while the highest ones @xmath71 , towards the western and southwestern part where the bright gmas are located .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath72 varies in a similar fashion with a range of @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the eastern and the western / southwestern parts of the emission respectively .",
    "line ratios as low as @xmath75 characterize the bulk of the relatively cold gas in the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the disk of the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same is true for @xmath76 , usually measured in the outer disk of the galaxy ( @xcite ) , or the disks of other galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; eckart et al .",
    "an lte approximation of such low ratios yields a @xmath77 k , comparable to the minimum value of 7  k permitted by cosmic ray heating ( goldsmith & langer 1978 ) .",
    "then a maximum brightness of @xmath0co j=10 would be @xmath78 k , much smaller what is usually measured in ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) , which implies sub - thermal excitation of the j=32 , 21 transitions towards the regions with such low @xmath64 and @xmath72 ratios .    on the other hand ratios as high as @xmath79",
    "are measured towards central regions of starbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and close to the cores of star forming gmcs like w3 in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a ratio of @xmath80 is found mainly towards the centers of nearby spirals ( @xcite ) , centers of starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , close to hii regions and star forming cores in the galaxy ( @xcite ) . in ngc 1068 the largest values ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 )",
    "are observed towards the location of the most massive gmas identified in the interferometer maps . under lte conditions",
    "these ratios imply average kinetic temperatures of @xmath83  k. in contrast , the bulk of the molecular gas in the plane of the milky way is significantly colder at @xmath84 k ( @xcite ) , undoubtly the result of a more quiescent environment than the central starburst region of ngc  1068 .      as reported previously the value of @xmath0co/@xmath21co ratio changes across the central kpc - size starburst region of ngc 1068 with the largest variations measured for the j=10 transition .",
    "this shows most prominently in high resolution interferometer maps ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "1996 ) but even in the area - averaged spectra shown in figure 5 .",
    "these spectra demonstrate that the ratio @xmath85@xmath86 ( j=10 ) changes by a factor of @xmath87 along the line profile while variations of @xmath88 ( j=21 ) and @xmath89 ( j=32 ) follow in a similar fashion but are significantly less prominent .",
    "it is important to note that the variation of @xmath90 across the line profile is not influenced by the systematic uncertainties of the line intensities , since they can only introduce an overall shift of the @xmath37 scale .",
    "the line shapes are subject only to the thermal rms error across the bandpass which is of the order of @xmath40 for the j=10 , and @xmath91 for the j=21 and 32 transitions .    the reason for using the ovro @xmath1co j=10 spectrum ( papadopoulos et al . 1996 ) , which does not include single dish data , instead of the one from bima / nrao 12 m ( helfer & blitz 1995 ) stems from the fact the later has a significantly lower s / n , a result of poor weather during the observations ( helfer , private communication ) .",
    "nevertheless both data sets exhibit the same basic characteristics .",
    "moreover , the largest variation of @xmath90 is found among the low and the high velocity end of the j=10 line profile , where the addition of the single flux data is not expected to alter the line intensity ( helfer & blitz  1995 ) .    in the inner kiloparsec - size region of ngc 1068",
    "we find @xmath92 ( j=0 , 1 ,  2 ) throughout , irrespective of location or averaging scale .",
    "for the entire range of the @xmath93 $ ] abundance values ( e.g. , langer & penzias 1993 ; henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) such high isotopic ratios correspond to low @xmath0co optical depths .",
    "assuming lte and @xmath93=40 $ ] , a value of @xmath94 corresponds to a @xmath95co j=10 optical depth of @xmath96 , and hence rather high @xmath97 and @xmath98 ratios ( or equivalently , high @xmath99 , @xmath100 ratios ) with respect to the ones observed .",
    "this has been used to support the notion of two - phase gas in starburst centers ( aalto et al .",
    "1995 ) , yet there is still a wide range of _ non - lte _ conditions that must be explored before such a conclusion can be reached .",
    "we will see that the best evidence for such a state of the molecular gas comes from the c@xmath8o j=10 ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "1996 ) and j=21 data ( this work ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath103 j=21 obtained at the two positions is @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "these values , while somewhat lower , are comparable to the average ratio @xmath106 found from high resolution ovro maps ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "1996 ) for the j=10 transition .",
    "moreover , these maps also show that the c@xmath8o emission does not smoothly trace @xmath1co in the various gmas and varies drastically from one location to the next with values as high as @xmath107 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the abundance ratio @xmath108=0.12 - 0.14 $ ] inferred for the milky way from various studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ratios @xmath109 are also found in several central starbursts of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while it is possible that an enhancement of the @xmath110 $ ] abundance can occur in starburst environments ( henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) and hence play a role in the observed high values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , it is very unlikely that it can be solely responsible for the high @xmath111 values observed in individual gmas ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "furthermore , the large spatial variations of the @xmath111 ratio over scales of @xmath113  pc are difficult to attribute solely to a varying @xmath114 $ ] abundance because the mixing of interstellar gas is expected to be effective enough to homogenize the isotope ratios over similar or larger scales , even during an ongoing burst of star formation ( henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) .",
    "thus , it seems more likely that the optical depth of the rare isotopes is not negligible . for @xmath115 , the optical depth of @xmath1co j=10 is @xmath116 ( lte assumed ) , which directly contradicts the general conclusion reached earlier from the @xmath90 ratio which yields @xmath117 .",
    "this constitutes the strongest evidence that @xmath0co , @xmath1co and c@xmath118o can not be all tracing the same phase of the molecular gas .",
    "line ratios of co and its isotopes as inputs to a radiative transfer model that solves the rate equations for the various rotational levels are useful probes of the physical conditions of the molecular gas .",
    "obviously the larger the number of the input ratios the better the constraints on the gas properties .",
    "the various spectral lines for ngc 1068 have been observed at very different angular resolutions with the lowest one ( @xmath119 for j=21 ) being comparable to the source size .",
    "hence , using the spatially - averaged spectra over the entire co emitting area ( @xmath120 ) allows the estimate of all the line ratios for that area and thus offers the maximum number of inputs that can be used to constrain the physical properties of the molecular gas .",
    "these line ratios are tabulated in table 2 .",
    "editor : place table 2 here    for the modeling of the molecular gas properties we used a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) code .",
    "we searched an extensive grid of lvg models with a parameter range of @xmath121 k ( @xmath122  k ) , @xmath123  @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) and , @xmath126 ( km s@xmath127  pc@xmath27)@xmath27 ( @xmath128 ) , where @xmath129 $ ] and @xmath130 is the velocity gradient for the `` average '' molecular cloud .",
    "we assumed an abundance ratio of @xmath131=40 $ ] since studies of the milky way ( langer & penzias 1993 ) and central regions of starburst galaxies ( henkel at al .",
    "1993 ; henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) show this value to be a suitable average of the abundances observed towards galactic centers .",
    "the abundance of @xmath132=0.15 $ ] is derived from @xmath131=40 $ ] and @xmath133=250 $ ] , which is the highest such value derived for molecular clouds in the milky way ( wannier 1980 ) , and was measured towards its center .",
    "we examine the entire grid of the lvg models for the values of @xmath72 , @xmath64 that correspond to @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 offset in the bima @xmath3co j=10 intensity .",
    "the best fit is found for the highest @xmath72 , @xmath137 ratios which correspond to the @xmath138 reduction in the flux density of the @xmath0co j=10 map .",
    "apart from giving the best fit , such an offset of the @xmath0co j=10 intensity observed by bima seem to be corroborated by single dish measurements reported by maiolino et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kaneko et al .",
    "the first used the nrao 12 m to obtain a velocity - integrated main beam brightness for the inner @xmath139 of ngc 1068 which is @xmath140 , while the latter used the nro 45 m telescope to map a similar area and found @xmath141 .",
    "these values were obtained from their data after converting the @xmath142 ( nrao 12 m ) and @xmath143 ( nro 45 m ) temperature scales to @xmath37 .",
    "the integrated flux found over the same region from the bima map is @xmath144 .",
    "clearly only a large offset of @xmath145 can bring the bima value in agreement with the other two .",
    "moreover , adopting such an offset yields @xmath146 , which in much better agreement with the value @xmath147 reported by braine & combes ( 1992 ) over the same angular size .",
    "the conditions corresponding to the best fit are @xmath148 k , @xmath149 @xmath24 and @xmath150 ( km s@xmath27 pc@xmath27)@xmath127 .",
    "it is interesting to note that thronson et al ( 1987 ) using mm / sub - mm continuum measurements deduce a dust temperature of t=20 k for the inner 55@xmath28 of this galaxy , which is similar to the gas temperatures we find from the lvg fits .",
    "this is expected for well mixed gas and dust where the @xmath0co , @xmath1co lines trace the same `` average '' conditions as the mm / sub - mm emission originating from dust .    as expected from our previous discussion , the best lvg model can not reproduce the observed high c@xmath8o/@xmath1co line ratios , since the deduced optical depth of the @xmath3co j=10 transition is @xmath151 . in this case",
    "@xmath1co , c@xmath8o are very optically thin and the ratio of their intensities is equal to their assumed relative abundance . the moderate optical depth of the @xmath22co j=10 transition was suggested by aalto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) as being one of the characteristics of a second , more diffuse and warm gas phase that surrounds a dense and more spatially concentrated one in the nuclear regions of starbursts ( see also wall et al .",
    "1993 for earlier work on spirals ) .",
    "this would naturally explain why both the average brightness of the @xmath0co j=10 transition as well as the @xmath90 line ratio are more sensitive functions of velocity ( and therefore of location within the galaxy ) than the j=21 , 32 transitions ( figure 5 ) and the @xmath88 , @xmath100 ratios respectively .",
    "for @xmath152 k it is @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( lte ) , hence a moderate @xmath155 corresponds to @xmath156 ( j=1,2 ) or higher .",
    "this range of @xmath157 values allows the @xmath3co j=10 transition to be significantly more sensitive than the j=21 and j=32 to variations of gas column density and excitation conditions .",
    "higher values @xmath158 would render all three transitions optically thick and thermalized even at moderate / low ( @xmath159 @xmath160 ) gas densities because of radiative trapping , and hence they would be equally `` insensitive '' to the conditions of the molecular gas except the kinetic temperature .",
    "on the other hand , significantly lower values @xmath161 yield small / moderate optical depths for all three transitions and not just j=10 .",
    "hence they will all be sensitive to the gas excitation conditions and their intensities and @xmath162 line ratios will vary strongly along the line profile , reflecting the changing excitation conditions in the inner region of ngc 1068 .",
    "an important consequence of the moderate @xmath0co j=10 and the correspondingly small ( @xmath163 ) @xmath1co j=10 optical depths is that the latter transition can be slightly super - thermally excited ( goldsmith 1972 ; de jong et al . 1975 ; leung & liszt 1976 ) .",
    "indeed for the best lvg solution it is @xmath164 for @xmath9co . in this case",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath165 to the excitation conditions with respect to the @xmath88 and @xmath166 ratios becomes more pronounced while @xmath167 , and @xmath168 can still be fitted with a single gas phase of small / moderate @xmath0co j=10 optical depth ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "later we will see that this property of the @xmath170co j=10 transition remains as one the characteristics of the diffuse gas phase in a two - component gas model .",
    "the inability of a single gas phase to account for the line ratios of the @xmath0co , @xmath9co and c@xmath8o isotopes in the starburst region of ngc 1068 suggests at least two distinct phases .",
    "one phase dominating the @xmath0co while the other is responsible for most of the c@xmath8o emission , and with the @xmath1co having contributions from both .",
    "the notion of a two - component or generally multi - component molecular gas phase seems trivial in the face of numerous studies of the milky way and other galaxies that reveal a large range of temperatures @xmath171 and densities @xmath172 for the molecular gas .",
    "this notion is indeed not particularly useful unless one includes the spatial scale involved .",
    "examination of the physical conditions of the molecular gas on scales of @xmath173 pc is bound to yield a very different picture depending on whether one looks at orion - type molecular clouds that harbor ongoing star formation or more quiescent ones .",
    "averaging over much larger ( @xmath174 kpc ) scales `` smoothes '' out the local density and temperature irregularities to a degree that a narrow range of temperatures and densities , deduced from molecular line spectroscopy , can fit the observed line ratios .",
    "_ it is when such `` averaging '' fails to converge towards a single narrow set of physical conditions that the notion of more than one molecular gas components becomes meaningful and necessary . _    numerous studies of molecular gas in other galaxies ( e.g. , knapp et al . 1980 ; wall & jaffe 1990 ; eckart et al .",
    "1991 ; braine & combes 1992 ; aalto et al .",
    "1995 ) have demonstrated a broad differentiation of molecular gas properties with warm ( @xmath175 k ) and dense gas ( @xmath176  @xmath177 ) lying in the inner @xmath178 kpc , while colder ( @xmath179 k ) , less dense ( @xmath180  @xmath24 ) gas is located further out in the disk .",

    "1995 ) and is thought to be driven by a variety of mechanisms , namely an intense uv field , large turbulent linewidths , tidal forces and cloud - cloud collisions . in this picture",
    "one phase consists of warm and diffuse and low - density molecular gas originating from the heated and disrupted outer envelopes of molecular clouds while the other one consists of the more `` protected '' interiors of such clouds where the gas is denser and colder .",

    "the high value of the @xmath89 ratio for phase ( a ) ( table 3 ) significantly restricts the lvg parameter space .",

    "two effects that can contribute to this difference in the estimated gas mass are : a ) the presence of a non - virialized gas component and , b ) a large optical depth of the particular co isotope used .",

    "our analysis suggests that such a non - virialized molecular gas component indeed exists and dominates the @xmath0co emission in the central region of ngc 1068 .",
    "the second effect is due to the fact that in an optically thick medium significant amounts of gas mass will contribute only a small fraction of the total observed luminosity .",
    "this is straightforward to understand when the line formation mechanism is local because then the observed emission comes from the outer layer of the cloud where @xmath344 and a lot of gas mass can `` hide '' in its interior .",
    "the @xmath345 s factors can , to a certain extent , correct for this effect but obviously this correction becomes increasingly unreliable the larger the optical depth .",
    "however in the case of large scale systematic motions within each cloud ( and among the various clouds themselves ) , the various optically thick components appear centered at different velocities along the line profile and hence are `` visible '' . in such a situation significant gas mass can still `` hide '' provided that the more optically thick component has a lower temperature , a smaller velocity gradient and overall volume than the more diffuse gas component .",
    "this is exactly the type of molecular gas differentiation found for the gas in ngc 1068 and generally in starburst centers .",

    "our study of the ir - luminous starburst in ngc 1068 suggests that in the inner few kiloparsecs , the highly excited , non - virialized molecular gas component that dominates the @xmath0co emission can be the cause of a systematic overestimate of molecular gas mass when a standard galactic conversion factor is used . in cases of other ir - luminous galaxies with powerful central starbursts like mrk 231 and ngc 7469 the gas mass deduced from the standard galactic conversion factor",
    "is manifestly overestimated since it yields a mass that is comparable or larger than the dynamical mass contained within the same volume ( bryant & scoville 1996 ; genzel et al .",

    "a single - phase lvg model yields average conditions that correspond to relatively dense molecular gas ( @xmath356 @xmath24 ) , with a temperature of @xmath357  k and optical depth @xmath11 for the @xmath0co j=10 transition .",
    "these conditions are not uniform and the @xmath0co @xmath358 ratio ( at resolution of @xmath295 ) and earlier interferometric measurements of the @xmath359@xmath360 and @xmath361@xmath362 j=10 ratios reveal a wide range of molecular gas properties in the inner @xmath2 starburst region of ngc 1068 .    \\2 . a single gas phase with moderate @xmath0co j=10 optical depths can not reproduce the high c@xmath4o/@xmath1co ( j=10 , 21 ) intensity ratio and its large spatial variations observed in interferometric maps of the j=10 transition .",
    "a simple two - component model is used to describe the state of the `` average '' molecular cloud as consisting of a dense ( @xmath363 @xmath24 ) , more spatially concentrated component where c@xmath8o j=10 has a moderate ( @xmath364 ) optical depth , surrounded by a more diffuse ( @xmath365 ) , warmer gas phase where the @xmath3co j=10 transition has @xmath11 .",
    "the dense and more spatially concentrated phase contains most of the gas mass . since the @xmath9co in this phase is optically thick , using this isotope to deduce molecular gas mass under the assumption that it has small / moderate optical depth throughout the co - emitting volume underestimates the true mass of this component and hence the total gas mass .",
    "the diffuse gas phase dominates the observed @xmath0co emission , it is highly excited and probably not virialized .",
    "this leads to an overestimate of molecular gas mass when the luminosity of the @xmath366co j=10 line and a standard galactic conversion factor are used to deduce gas mass in starburst environments .",
    "since type 2 seyferts harbor starbursts more often than type 1 or field spirals , it follows that the use of the standard galactic conversion factor will systematically overestimate the global molecular gas mass in seyfert 2 s .",
    "we would like to thank the great crew of telescope operators and support scientists at the james clerk maxwell telescope where most of observations were taken .",
    "special thanks must go to per friberg for his patient explanations of the telescope s workings and to lorne avery and henry matthews for performing some of the observations on our behalf .",
    "we are greatful to the referee dr tamara helfer for her suggestions that improved this work .",
