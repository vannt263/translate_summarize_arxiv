    "large positive magnetoresistance in two - dimensional systems in the in - plane magnetic field is typically explained by a modification in the spin system of the charge carriers .",
    "studies of the in - plane field induced magnetoresistance were conducted in numbers of low - density heterostructures @xmath15-si mos  @xcite , @xmath15-si / sige  @xcite , @xmath15-gaas / algaas  @xcite , @xmath1-gaas / algaas  @xcite , @xmath15-al@xmath16ga@xmath17as / alas / al@xmath16ga@xmath17as  @xcite .",
    "indeed , within the narrow quantum well approximation the orbital motion of the charge carriers is suppressed , but the zeeman splitting @xmath18 lifts spin degeneracy , where @xmath19 is the effective g - factor , @xmath20 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath21 is the total magnetic field .",
    "thus , when the magnetic field is rising the conduction band is being split into two subbands with the opposite spin directions and , finally , all spin - down electrons find themselves in the bottom subband under the fermi level .",
    "consequently , the electronic system becomes completely spin - polarized . as a rule , in the magnetic fields exceeding a critical value corresponding to the field of full spin polarization a saturation of resistance",
    "is observed  @xcite .",
    "several spin effect - based theories were developed to interpret the nature of positive magnetoresistance  @xcite .    however , in some studies on @xmath15- and @xmath1-gaas / algaas  @xcite no saturation of the magnetoresistance was observed .",
    "authors of the theory ref .   interpreted that experimental fact by coupling of the in - plane field to the carrier orbital motion due to the finite thickness of the 2d - layer .",
    "validity of such a model proves to be true experimentally : unlike cases of refs .",
    "where the investigated samples @xmath1-gaas / algaas by all appearances had a _ wide _ quantum well , in @xmath1-gaas / algaas with the _ narrow _ quantum well a distinct saturation of positive magnetoresistance was observed  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that positive magnetoresistance in parallel magnetic fields was observed in dilute carrier systems only .    in the system under study @xmath1-si",
    "/ si@xmath22ge@xmath23/si a quantum well formed in the strained si@xmath22ge@xmath23 is asymmetrical due to only one of the silicon barriers to be boron doped . the threefold ( not considering a spin ) degenerated valence band of sige is split into 3 subbands due to a strong spin - orbit interaction and a strain [ 11 ] . the top subband occupied by heavy holes",
    "is formed by the states with quantum numbers @xmath24=1 , @xmath25=1/2 , @xmath26=3/2 . as a result , there is a strong anisotropy of the g - factor with respect to the magnetic field orientation : @xmath27 4.5 when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the quantum well plane , and @xmath28 0 when the field is oriented in the plane of the 2d channel  @xcite .",
    "thus , the zeeman spin splitting in a parallel field is small .",
    "considering this fact several authors , for example ,  @xcite stated that effect of an in - plane magnetic field on the resistance in this material has to be very weak .",
    "that opinion was based also on a few experiments  @xcite carried out on the p - si / sige systems with @xmath292.5@xmath210@xmath5@xmath4 .",
    "the experimental results presented below show that a parallel magnetic field still greatly affects the resistance in the low - density @xmath1-si / sige / si quantum well despite the lack of the spin effect .",
    "the dc magnetoresistance @xmath0 was measured in the in - plane magnetic field on two @xmath1-si / sige / si quantum wells , with the carrier densities @xmath1=8.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath1=2@xmath210@xmath5@xmath4 , respectively , and a hole mobility of @xmath30 @xmath31/v@xmath32s at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "the studies were performed in the fields of up to 18 t and in the temperature range of 0.3 - 2 k at two orientations of the in - plane magnetic field @xmath6 with respect to the current @xmath7 : @xmath8 and @xmath33 .",
    "the 2d - system si@xmath34b@xmath35/si / sige/ si/(001)si was grown in warwick on a si ( 001 ) substrate by the solid source molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "it consisted of the 300 nm si buffer layer followed by 30 nm si@xmath36ge@xmath37 layer ( sample with @xmath1=8.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 ) or si@xmath38ge@xmath39 layer ( sample with @xmath1=2@xmath210@xmath5@xmath4 ) , 20 nm undoped spacer and 50 nm layer of b - doped si with doping concentration 2.5@xmath40  @xmath41 .",
    "magnetoresistance of the sample with @xmath1=8.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 was studied in detail earlier in wide range of transverse magnetic fields and temperatures  @xcite . at the field",
    "@xmath21=0 t the resistance in both samples demonstrated a metallic behavior .",
    "[ rxxb ] illustrates dependences of the resistance @xmath0 on the in - plane magnetic field @xmath6 at various temperatures .",
    "it is evident , that @xmath42 curves related to the sample with @xmath1=8.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 while been measured at different temperatures cross at a single point corresponding to @xmath43 7.2 t and @xmath44 ohm . at this field",
    "the resistivity does not depend on the temperature , i.e. @xmath45 changes from positive to negative .",
    "such crossing is often interpreted as a metal - to - insulator transition . in other words ,",
    "the metallic state is suppressed by fields higher than 7.2 t. in the sample with @xmath1=2@xmath210@xmath5@xmath4 the increase of the magnetoresistance is just three times in the field range of 0 - 18 t ( see fig .  [ rxxb ] ) . over the entire range of the magnetic field used in the experiments this sample shows a metallic behavior as @xmath460 .    as seen in fig .",

    "that system also was in a metallic state in the fields of up to @xmath6=12 t used in ref .  .    in fig .",
    "[ rxxbt ] the same magnetoresistance data obtained on the sample with @xmath1=8.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 are replotted as the dependencies @xmath48 at several field values to clarify the modification of the @xmath45 and its sign change at the field of 7.2 t.    the samples were mounted on a one axis rotator  @xcite . that allowed to determine the sample position at which the field was aligned parallel to the quantum well plane with an error of less than 10 minutes .",
    "[ rotate ] illustrates the effect of sample rotation on the resistivity @xmath0 .",
    "the angle @xmath49 corresponding to the precise alignment of the magnetic field parallel to the 2d - channel plane were determined at the @xmath0 maximal value .    by rotating the sample in a constant @xmath6 , a perpendicular field component is induced .",
    "that leads to appearance of the shubnikov -de haas ( sdh ) oscillations .",
    "the oscillations pattern allows tracking the concentration change with , for instance , magnetic field intensity @xmath6 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ rotate ] , with decrease of parallel component of applied magnetic field the position of sdh oscillations shifts to larger angles .",
    "however , if to replot @xmath0 against the normal component of magnetic field @xmath50 ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ rotate ] ) it appears that the oscillations minima for every @xmath6 are at the same @xmath50 .",
    "if the positive magnetoresistance is determined by spin effects , then in the tilted field the structure of the sdh oscillations should depend on intensity of the parallel field @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is less than the field , corresponding to a totally polarized electron system @xmath51 , there is either appearance of oscillations with another period  @xcite or a change in @xmath50-position of the oscillations minima , corresponding to the lower spin subband , until the magnetic field achieves the point of total spin polarization  @xcite .",
    "these facts are indicative of the two spin subbands repopulation with increase of the in - plane magnetic field @xmath6 till @xmath51 .    according to our results ( fig .",
    "[ rotate ] ) in the fields @xmath52 10 t nothing happens to position of the oscillations .",
    "this may support our interpretation that spin subbands are not formed .",
    "another explanation would be that @xmath53 10 t. the dependence @xmath54 presented in fig .",
    "[ rxxb ] shows pronounce increase with magnetic field without any trend to saturation .",
    "thus explanation of such increase even assuming that @xmath55 would require account of orbital effects .",
    "the temperature dependence of the conductivity @xmath56 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ lnsxx ] . at @xmath5712 t",
    "this dependence has an activation character : @xmath58 , with the activation energy @xmath59 depending on the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the activation - like temperature dependence at @xmath60 12 t is a a characteristic of the hole freezing - out on localized states .",
    "the corresponding conductance mechanism could be the nearest neighbour hopping .",
    "the process of magnetic freezing - out is associated with sufficiently high magnetic fields where the wave function deformation takes place .",
    "the inset ( a ) in fig.[lnsxx ] shows that for different orientations this deformation occurs in different ways : it is stronger for the @xmath8 configuration than for @xmath9 one .",
    "however , in the field region of 7 - 12 t the holes conductivity mechanism could be hardly identified .",
    "indeed , the temperature dependence of conductivity could be interpreted as activation with the energy @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ lnsxx ] ) , and corresponding conductance mechanism could be the nearest neighbour hopping .",
    "however , in the same magnetic fields region the condition @xmath62 is also valid ( see inset ( b ) of fig .  [ lnsxx ] ) , which could be expounded , for example , as quantum corrections to conductivity of the delocalized holes as done in ref .  .",
    "to specify the conductivity mechanisms of charge carriers ( holes ) in parallel magnetic fields higher than 7.2 t it is useful to compare the conductivity on a direct current with the high - frequency conductivity . in the present work the ac conductivity ,",
    "being generally a complex function @xmath63 , has been measured on the same samples by acoustic methods .",
    "the acoustic technique involves measurements of the acoustoelectric effects : the variations of the velocity @xmath64 and the attenuation @xmath65 of a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the absorption and velocity at @xmath21=0 , respectively ) in the in - plane a magnetic field of up to 18 t at temperatures 0.3 - 2 k. the measurements were performed in the frequency range of @xmath68 mhz .",
    "simultaneous measurements @xmath69 and @xmath70 allow to determine real @xmath71 and imaginary @xmath72 components of the ac conductivity @xmath73 in the probeless way . as ge and si",
    "are not piezoelectric materials , the hybrid method was used .",
    "according to this technique the saw is generated and propagates on a surface of a piezoelectric linbo@xmath74 plate , while the sample is slightly pressed to the plate by springs .",
    "thus , the electric field , accompanying the saw and having the same frequency , penetrates the sample and interacts with the holes in a quantum well . in this configuration of the experiment no deformation",
    "is transmitted into the sample .",
    "ac measurements were also conducted in two configurations : @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the saw wave vector .    shown in fig .",

    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1dcfreq ] , that ac and dc conductivities coincide in the fields of up to @xmath43 11 - 12 t. as is also obvious from the figure , the magnetic field , at which @xmath88 and @xmath71 start to diverge , depends on a frequency : the higher the frequency the less this field .",
    "the ac and dc conductivity up to @xmath43 11 - 12 t is due to delocalized holes . at @xmath60 12 t",
    "a localization of the charge carriers begins , resulting in the nearest neighbour hopping in the dc and the `` two - site '' hopping ac conductivity  @xcite .",
    "the latter is characterized by a frequency dependence of @xmath71 ( see inset ( b ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : s1dcfreq ] ) and emergence of the imaginary component @xmath72 ( see inset ( a ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : s1dcfreq ] ) .",
    "moreover , as seen in inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : s1dcfreq ] , at fields @xmath60 15 t the ratio @xmath91 is valid , which is typical of the `` two - site '' hopping for two - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "according to these results , at @xmath92 12 t the charge carriers are localized and the conductance is due to hopping .",
    "it supports the conclusion that near @xmath937.2 t the hole states are seemingly extended up to @xmath4312 t. consequently , temperature dependence of conductivity is most likely determined by interplay between weak localization and e - e interactions . in this paper",
    "we do not focus on detailed study of the conductivity in the vicinity of @xmath947.2 t because of the small variation of conductivity with temperature and narrow available temperature interval .",
    "we now consider the magnetic field dependence of the magnetoresistance shown in fig.[rxxregions ] . the single point on the curve corresponds to @xmath6=7.2 t. on the metallic side until @xmath6=4 t the magnetoresistance obeys a power law @xmath95 . in the fields below 13 t",

    "this effect is observed in the system with lowest density ( @xmath1=8.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 ) only . when the magnetic field rises up to 18 t , the resistivity in this sample increases significantly and changes by more than three orders of magnitude , while in the sample with @xmath1=2@xmath210@xmath5@xmath4 the magnetoresistance increase is just several times in the same field range .",
    "\\2 ) in the sample with @xmath1=8.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 the derivative @xmath99 changes its sign at @xmath100 7.2 t. it could be interpreted as a magnetic field suppression of the metallic state . in the sample with @xmath1=2@xmath210@xmath5@xmath4 the sign change of @xmath99 was not observed .",

    "authors of ref .",
    "neglect spin - related effects and consider the in - plane magnetoresistance as affected by the charge carrier orbital motion in the wide quantum well .",
    "if to assume that the quantum well bottom is distorted weakly , one may hold @xmath109 cm . then the magnetic length @xmath110 becomes less than thickness of 2d layer and condition ( a )",
    "is fulfilled already at @xmath12 1 t.      the theory  @xcite predicts ( i ) a large positive magnetoresistance in systems with low carrier density ; ( ii ) a large anisotropy of resistivity in the 2d plane @xmath115 ; ( iii ) a reduction of the effect with increasing density ; and ( iv ) a change of the @xmath116 dependence : at low b ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 , at high b ( @xmath119 ) , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the subband splitting , and @xmath122 is the cyclotron frequency .",

    "the absence of a strong effect of the in - plane magnetic field on the resistivity in ref .   can be possibly attributed to the relatively high carrier density in the system studied there .",
