    "for systems without spatial inversion symmetry the appearance of directed flow of particles induced by a time - periodic parameter variation with a zero - mean force is now commonly known as the ratchet effect ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon is ubiquitous in nature so that such flows appear in a variety of systems including asymmetric crystals @xcite and semiconductor surfaces @xcite under light radiation , vortexes in josephson junction arrays @xcite , macroporous silicon membranes @xcite , microfluidic channels @xcite and others .",
    "a significant increase of interest to ratchets is related to the experimental progress in the investigation of molecular transport in biological systems like proteins characterized by asymmetry and non - equilibrium @xcite . at the same time the nanotechnology development allowed to fabricate artificial asymmetric nanostuctures with the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) where it has been shown that infrared or microwave radiation creates a ratchet transport @xcite . the theoretical studies predicted that the directionality of ratchet flow in such systems can be controlled by the polarization of radiation @xcite that has been confirmed by recent experiments with a semi - disk galton board for 2deg in algaas / gaas heterojunctions @xcite .",
    "till present the theoretical studies of ratchet transport have been done mainly for non - interacting particles @xcite . however , in many systems the interactions between particles are of primary importance like for example for microfluidic channels @xcite , 2deg nanostructures with strong electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) interactions at a large @xmath0 parameter @xcite , granulated materials @xcite and one - dimensional luttinger liquids @xcite . on a first glance it seems that a strong scattering between particles should suppress the ratchet transport .",
    "but on the other hand the local conservation of momentum of particles indicates that even in presence of strong interactions the ratchet flow still should exist .",
    "the investigation of the properties of ratchet transport for interacting particles in two dimensions is the main aim of this paper .",
    "the theory developed is based on the kinetic approach used in @xcite extended to the case of strong interactions .",
    "the theory is compared with the extensive numerical simulations of ratchet transport of interacting particles in asymmetric structures .",

    "such a combination of two methods for systems with interactions and _ ac-_driving has been already used in @xcite . as in @xcite",

[ fig4 ] below ) .",
    "in the cuts model it is assumed that the scattering on cuts takes place instantaneously at random moments of time which have a poisson distribution with time scale @xmath9 .",

    "we also note that at strong interactions the rescaled ratchet characteristics are not sensible to the temperature variation that indicates that we have an effective liquid flow with temperature independent viscosity .",

    "<S> the developed kinetic theory gives a good description of these two limiting regimes . </S>",
