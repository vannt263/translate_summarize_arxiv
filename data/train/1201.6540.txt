    "the growth and investigation of semiconductor nanowires ( nws ) represent a quickly growing research field due to their potential application in electronic and optoelectronic devices . the equilibrium modification of bulk iii - as semiconductors is the zincblende ( zb ) phase .",
    "when grown in the nw form , however , these materials crystallize partially or even predominantly in the wurtzite ( wz ) structure @xcite .",
    "in particular , gaas nws often exhibit a mixed crystal structure with zb and wz segments alternating along the nw axis @xcite .",
    "since these phases differ from each other in their band gap , gaas nws represent heterostructures with complex optical properties , the interpretation of which is currently discussed controversially . in particular , the value of the band gap energy of wz gaas is under debate . on the one hand",
    ", it is reported that the band gap energy of wz gaas ( @xmath1 ) is larger by 30 to 50  mev than the one of zb gaas ( @xmath0).@xcite on the other hand , results of theoretical and experimental investigations suggest that @xmath1 is slightly smaller than @xmath0 or on the same level .",
    "@xcite    there is a broad consensus that the wz - zb interface in gaas exhibits a type ii band alignment , where the conduction and valence band energy levels are higher in wz than in zb gaas .",
    "since the carrier diffusion length in gaas is usually large ( on the order of 1  @xmath3 m ) , electrons are very efficiently captured within zb segments .",
    "this results in a large probability to predominantly observe luminescence at energies lower than the band gap energies of either polytype , even if only a small number of zb segments exists within the structure .",
    "moreover , the presence of defect levels often favors the observation of luminescence at energies below that of the band gap , particularly for measurements at low temperatures ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , a clear interpretation of luminescence spectra of gaas nws requires more detailed investigations , where the most crucial question is the one about the actual value of @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    ", we present experimental results on gaas nws containing both phases , where depending on the growth conditions luminescence is observed predominantly above or below @xmath0 .",
    "the observed luminescence spectra are in agreement with the assumption of a value of @xmath1 larger than the one of @xmath0 , where electrons captured within the zb segments recombine with holes of the neighboring wz segments .",
    "thus , the energy of the corresponding luminescence lines exceeds @xmath0 for very thin zb segments due to electron confinement .",
    "gaas nws were prepared by molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) using ga- and au - induced vapor - liquid - solid ( vls ) growth on phosphorous - doped on - axis ( @xmath5 ) si(111 ) substrates .",
    "the native oxide was intentionally left on the substrates , and a water desorption step was performed under ultra high vacuum at 300@xmath6c for 20  min . in the mbe chamber , the si substrate was heated to 580@xmath6c , a constant as@xmath7 beam equivalent pressure of @xmath8  mbar was set , and gaas nanowire growth started on opening of the ga shutter .",
    "the total growth time was 1  h. for sample # 1 , the ga supply was set to match a planar growth rate of 820  nm / h , which led to an atomic flux ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "stoichiometric conditions ( @xmath9 ) were identified by the transition between the ga - rich @xmath10 and the as - rich @xmath11 reconstruction for planar growth on gaas(001 ) at 580@xmath6c.@xcite in contrast , sample # 2 was grown using half the ga flux ( @xmath12 ) under otherwise identical growth conditions . for both samples , the growth of an ( al , ga)as shell with a nominal al content of 10% was initiated after 30  min by opening the al shutter . a coverage of the gaas nws with an ( al , ga)as shell was necessary to enhance the luminescence efficiency enabling optical investigations at moderate and low excitation densities @xcite .    as a reference sample ( # ref ) ,",
    "bare gaas nws , which were known to crystallize predominantly in the wz structure,@xcite were deposited on si(111 ) by au - induced vls growth .",
    "au droplets were prepared on the oxide - free substrate by deposition of a 0.6    thin au layer and subsequent heating .",
    "gallium and as fluxes then were set as for sample # 2 , and nws were grown for 30  min at 500@xmath6c .    for the structural characterization of the nws , we performed x - ray - diffraction ( xrd ) and raman measurements .",
    "high - resolution xrd experiments were carried out using a panalytical x - pert pro mrd  system with a ge(220 ) hybrid monochromator and a three bounce ge(220 ) channel cut analyzer crystal .",
    "we used cuk@xmath13 radiation with a wavelength of @xmath14   .",
    "continuous - wave micro - photoluminescence ( @xmath3pl ) and micro - raman measurements were performed for as - grown nws and for nws dispersed on a si substrate at a temperature of 10  k using the 633  nm line of a he - ne laser and the 413  nm line of a kr@xmath15 ion laser for excitation , respectively .",
    "the laser beam was focused by a 50@xmath16 microscope objective to a spot of about 1  @xmath3 m diameter . the pl or raman signal",
    "was collected by the same objective , dispersed spectrally in a single spectrograph ( 600  mm@xmath17 grating , 800  mm focal length ) , and detected by a liquid - nitrogen - cooled charge - coupled device array .",
    "the elastically backscattered stray light was suppressed by a notch filter .",
    "the raman signal was not analyzed for its polarization .",
    "due to a nw area density of about 1  @xmath3m@xmath18 for all samples , approximately 13 nws were excited by the laser spot while illuminating the as - grown samples from the top during pl measurements .",
    "raman spectra were recorded in backscattering geometry with the light collected perpendicular to the nw axes .",
    "spatially resolved measurements of the luminescence spectra along the axis of nws , which were dispersed on a si substrate , have been performed by cathodoluminescence spectroscopy ( cl ) in a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) . moreover , secondary electron ( se ) and monochromatic cl images were acquired simultaneously for an accurate assignment of the local origin of the cl .",
    "the cl / se experiments were performed using a zeiss field - emission sem equipped with a gatan and he - cooling stage system for sample temperatures between 6  k and 300  k. the cl system can be operated with either a photomultiplier tube for monochromatic imaging or a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detector to record cl spectra . for the acquisition of",

    "the observed maxima centered at 27.13@xmath6 and 27.30@xmath6 correspond to lattice plane distances of 0.3288 and 0.3264  nm and , therefore , can be assigned to the wz gaas ( 0002 ) and zb gaas ( 111 ) reflection , respectively .",
    "this assignment is consistent with the assumption that the nws of the reference sample , for which the narrow peak at 27.13@xmath6 is most pronounced , crystallize predominantly in the wz structure .",
    "the large width of the gaas ( 111 ) reflection is caused by the fact that parasitic growth leads to an evolution of a highly defective and probably strained gaas layer in between the nws , which in addition to the nws contributes to the zb reflection .",
    "most importantly , both samples # 1 and # 2 exhibit a weak but distinct peak near the wz gaas ( 0002 ) reflection indicating that the nws of both samples contain segments of wz gaas .",
    "the small shift toward lower angles with regard to the gaas ( 0002 ) reflection of the reference sample is probably caused by the presence of the ( al , ga)as shell , which is not existent in the reference sample .",

    "[ fig8](b ) , we compare the spectra with the highest and lowest peak energy .",
    "note that the cl intensities are represented on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the thermal distribution of carriers is reflected by an exponential tail of the cl intensity on the high - energy side of the spectra .",
    "the slope of this tail is the same for all spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and indicates the actual temperature of the free carriers under the chosen excitation conditions .",
    "thus , the energy shift of the exponential tail between the spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) represents the maximal energy difference that we have measured along the nw .",
    "we assume this difference amounting to 55  mev to be the lower bound for the band gap difference between wz and zb gaas .",

    "thus for nws consisting of alternate zb and wz gaas segments , electrons captured within the zb segments recombine with holes of the neighboring wz segments as illustrated in fig .",
    "for low @xmath4 , this results in excitons bound to the zb / wz interface .",

    "we assume a wz conduction band offset with respect to zb gaas of @xmath34  mev @xcite , and we take into account a band gap difference of 55  mev , which we found experimentally to be the lower bound of the difference @xmath26 .",

    "it becomes evident that emission energies higher than @xmath0 are expected only for very thin zb insertions , i.e. , @xmath38  bilayers .",
    "a spontaneous polarization @xmath39 along the ( 0001 ) direction is a property intrinsic to wz semiconductors but vanishes for zb phases due to their higher symmetry . as the latter is the equilibrium phase for gaas and an interest in the wz polytype",
    "has only recently come up with the advent of nw growth , the possibility of a spontaneous polarization in wz gaas has not been treated in the literature . for the investigation of the impact of @xmath39 on of @xmath40 ,",
    "the calculations have further been performed taking a spontaneous polarization into account .",
    "the deviation from the ideal tetrahedral coordination of the atoms characterized by the internal parameter @xmath41 is comparable  but opposite in direction  to that of gan@xcite , while the bond ionicity is lower than that of gan .",

    "[ fig10 ] , this small value of @xmath39 leads to a significant increase of the slope of @xmath42 ) and , consequently , to a larger reduction of @xmath28 with increasing thickness of the zb insertion as for @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , energies higher than @xmath0 should be observable only for @xmath43  bilayers .    in the framework of the above model , the different emission properties of samples # 1 and # 2 can be explained by assuming a higher probability for the occurrence of very thin zb sections ( @xmath43  bilayers ) for sample # 1 , whereas for sample # 2 the zb sections are in general thicker than 79  bilayers . while for the former , the electron confinement leads to values of @xmath28 exceeding @xmath0 , the electron confinement is small for sample # 2 and @xmath28 is generally found below @xmath0 .",
    "zincblende insertions of two , three , and four bilayers can be considered as different kinds of stacking faults in wz gaas .",
    "as the corresponding qw interfaces are atomically smooth , such stacking fault qws of different thicknesses should result in distinct sharp luminescence lines .",
    "this phenomenon of luminescence from excitons bound to stacking faults is actually well known for wz gan micro structures@xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath3pl spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] exhibit distinct and sharp emission lines",
    ". a direct comparison of the energy of these sharp lines with the calculated @xmath40 of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , however , is not conclusive because of the simplifications made in the calculation .",
    "luminescence of gaas nanowires consisting of wurtzite and zincblende segments is spread over a wide spectral range , which we explain in terms of a type ii band alignment of the zb / wz heterostructure sequence .",
    "depending on the growth conditions , we observe luminescence below and clearly above the band gap energy of zb gaas .",
    "the latter indicates a wider band gap for the wz as compared to the zb modification of gaas .",
    "the thickness of the zb insertion controls the energy of the transition between electrons confined in this insertion and holes of the neighboring wz sections .",
    "this energy can exceed @xmath0 for zb insertions as thin as a few bilayers as a result of the confinement of the electrons .",
    "obviously , this condition is fulfilled for sample # 1 investigated in this study , while for sample # 2 the thickness of the zb segments of the nws must be generally larger than the above mentioned critical value , even though the total amount of zb and wz in the two samples is comparable according to the results from xrd and raman measurements .",
    "thus , our results clarify why in some previous works luminescence was not observed at energies above @xmath0 @xcite , while in other works luminescence was also observed above the band gap energy of zb gaas@xcite .    at low temperatures , defect - related optical transitions",
    "contribute essentially to the observed diversity and high probability of luminescence lines below @xmath0 .",
    "in particular for sample # 2 , an accumulation of emission lines at energies , which can be assigned to the donor - acceptor - pair and conduction - band - acceptor transition , have been observed , where carbon acts as an acceptor .",
    "acceptors exhibit a large carrier capture cross section and can , thus , effectively bind holes within the zb segments , namely preventing the hole diffusion toward the wz segments .",
    "thus , an absence of emission lines above @xmath0 is very probable especially for low temperatures , but does not mean an absence of higher energy states .",
    "the possible energy range of optical transitions increases , if spontaneous polarization is taken into account .    by means of spatially resolved cl measurements at 300  k , we estimate the lower bound for the difference @xmath26 to be 55  mev .",

    "<S> gaas nanowires ( nws ) grown by molecular - beam epitaxy may contain segments of both the zincblende ( zb ) and wurtzite ( wz ) phases . depending on the growth conditions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that optical emission of such nws occurs either predominantly above or below the band gap energy of zb gaas ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the assumption that the band gap energy of wurtzite gaas ( @xmath1 ) is larger than @xmath0 and that gaas nws with alternating zb and wz segments along the wire axis establish a type ii band alignment , where electrons captured within the zb segments recombine with holes of the neighboring wz segments . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the corresponding transition energy depends on the degree of confinement of the electrons , and transition energies exceeding @xmath0 are possible for very thin zb segments . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the incorporation of carbon acceptors plays a major role in determining the spectral profile as these can effectively bind holes in the zb segments . from cathodoluminescence measurements of single gaas nws performed at room temperature , </S>",
    "<S> we deduce a lower bound of 55  mev for the difference @xmath2 . </S>"
