    "the rapidly evolving field of hadron spectroscopy is increasingly motivated by firm expectations of seeing new types of matter@xcite .",
    "ordinary \" mesons are thought to be confined quark - antiquark pairs in spin singlet / triplet states and with orbital and radial excitation .",
    "non - perturbative qcd in addition predicts that for each ordinary meson there are higher lying states with excited gluonic energy ( hybrids ) and that there should also be mesons composed essentially of pure glue energy ( glueballs ) . further complicating the experimental situation",
    "are possible four quark mesons ( molecules ) or dynamically generated resonances not having any clear relation to the quark picture .    in the most recent particle data group report",
    "@xcite there are about 100 well established meson states composed of light quarks @xmath0 and glue . of these ,",
    "56 have been assigned into constituent quark multiplets @xcite .",
    "since the vast majority of the observed meson states lie in energy below 2.5  gev a straightforward method of separating the ordinary mesons from hybrids , glueballs etc",
    ".  would be very useful .",
    "previous work @xcite in understanding the meson spectrum has either centered on detailed quark models or on the search for su(3 ) flavor nonets .",
    "both approaches are sensitive to details such as mixing between nonets or with hybrids and glueballs .",
    "although such considerations are crucial to a complete understanding , the proposed classification is based on some simple observations and is relatively model independent .",
    "first we draw some motivation from the well - understood heavy onia mesons composed of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "these states are classified by the orbital angular momentum and radial excitation of the heavy quarks .",
    "the spin dependence is much smaller than the quark motion energies and therefore each state of orbital and radial excitation consists for @xmath3 of four nearly degenerate states ( e.g.  @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . for @xmath8",
    "the group is just two states .",
    "the corresponding regge trajectories look very different when plotted conventionally as total angular momentum @xmath9 vs.  @xmath10 . here",
    "it is evident that there is a  fundamental \" orbital angular momentum trajectory @xmath11 that breaks into a family of trajectories when the spin is turned on .",
    "nothing spectacular happens in the case of light quarks except that the spin splittings are somewhat larger .",
    "thus our first principle will be to consider all light quark states of the same orbital and radial excitation quantum numbers to form natural groups . for @xmath3 and three light quarks",
    "there are expected to be sixteen members of each group ( and eight members for @xmath8 groups ) .",
    "clearly , a few such groups accounts for a lot of mesons .    for light quarks ( and actually also true for heavy quark bound states ) the confining interaction dominates the meson dynamics .",
    "the confining interaction closest to qcd is the qcd string / flux tube .",
    "the flux tube has all the proper qcd relativistic corrections @xcite as well as the correct regge slope of @xmath12 @xcite",
    ". a string tension of a= 0.16  gev@xmath13 yields the universal regge slope of 1  gev@xmath14 .",
    "in addition the long range excited glue spectrum is correctly predicted@xcite .",
    "the light quark qcd flux tube spectroscopy can be exactly numerically calculated@xcite and analytically accurately estimated @xcite by , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the meson excitation energy and @xmath17 takes the values @xmath18   and @xmath19 .",
    "we should note the factor @xmath20 which implies degenerate tower states of either even or odd @xmath17",
    ".    the effect of an attractive short - range interaction will be to lower @xmath16 for a given @xmath17 . for large @xmath17 the short - range interaction , @xmath21 , shifts  @xcite the regge trajectory to smaller @xmath22 by @xmath23 . for @xmath8",
    "this shift is somewhat larger . in fig .  1 we show by the solid lines the regge trajectories due to confinement alone .",
    "these trajectories given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) consist of the leading @xmath24 and evenly spaced daughter trajectories all of slope @xmath12 ( or unit slope in this graph ) .",
    "this structure is numerically accurate for a straight string and also for a dynamically curved string  @xcite .",
    "the dashed curves represent mesons with both confinement and with short range ( taking @xmath25 ) interaction .",
    "one hundred mev has been subtracted for each strange quark in these mesons .",
    "the solid lines are the string confinement spectroscopy of eq.(1 ) .",
    "the dashed curves are confinement plus the short distance coulomb term @xmath26 with @xmath25  @xcite.,width=336 ]",
    "we first consider the light quark mesons @xcite that have been assigned to constituent quark configurations .",
    "we subdivide these according to their assigned orbital and radial quantum numbers @xmath17 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath28  gev@xmath14 we plot @xmath29 for each of these mesons in fig.1 . in this calculation we have subtracted 0.1  gev for each strange quark to roughly account for the differing quark masses .",
    "the  fundamental \" regge plot of fig.1 shows that all of the 56 assigned quark model states indeed fall into a few well defined groups .",
    "all of the expected states of the 1s , 2s , and 1p groups are present ( 32 mesons ) .",
    "the 1d group has currently 12 of the 16 expected and the 3s 4 of 8 states .",
    "we see that the 2p , and 1f groups each has 4 out of the expected 16 .",
    "one expects the remaining mesons in these groups to be present .",
    "we also indicate several groups expected at higher energies .",
    "in the conservative meson summary table @xcite there are several mesons that have no logical place in fig 1 .",
    "the @xmath30 is probably a dynamical state and the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are surely some sort of four quark / molecule state associated with the @xmath33 threshold .",
    "much has been written on the nature of these states @xcite .",
    "between 1 and 2 gev there are the 1p , 2s , 1d , 3s , and 2p groups .",
    "although there are numerous missing states in these groups there is no place for the @xmath34 which may well be a glueball .",
    "there is also mounting evidence for two exotic mesons of @xmath35 ( at 1.4 and 1.6 gev ) which by their quantum numbers can not be ordinary mesons .",
    "one of these is an excellent candidate for a hybrid meson .",
    "considerable further speculation is certainly possible but will not be pursued here .",
    "using some general organizing concepts we outline the number , quantum numbers , and approximate energies of the expected quark - antiquark ( ordinary ) mesons . from orbital and radial motion dominance",
    "we find that all ( 56 ) of the mesons currently @xcite assigned as constituent quark model states fall into well defined groups as shown in fig.1 .",
    "for massless ( ultra - relativistic ) quarks and with linear confinement the allowed eigenstates generally lie on straight regge trajectories with parallel daughter trajectories  @xcite .",
    "the qcd string seems to be similar to qcd at large distances giving the simple spectrum ( 1 ) . as seen in fig .  1 , the observed meson groups organize neatly into these fundamental trajectories when supplemented by the expected short range interaction .",
    "these groupings represent , in a model - independent way , what one might expect in the way of ordinary mesons .",
    "this should be a useful tool in the identification of the new matter states .",
