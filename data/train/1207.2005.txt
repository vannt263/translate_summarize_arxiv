    "solar quiescent prominences observed in the hydrogen h@xmath3 line ( @xmath4=6562.8   ) are long living and globally stable structures , having a typical density of the order of @xmath5 g @xmath1 ( @xmath6=10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 @xmath1 ) and a typical temperature of the order of 10@xmath9 k @xcite .",
    "prominence plasma is coupled to magnetic fields , which channel plasma flows , carry plasma away and/or support it against solar gravity @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields insulate also relatively cold and dense prominence plasma from the surrounding hot and much more dilute coronal plasma .",
    "although the overall structure of the quiescent prominence is relatively stable , numerous small - scale structures observed inside the prominences , like well outlined knots of plasma or extended flows , are locally highly dynamic and move along complicated , curved trajectories .",
    "precise measurements of magnetic fields in solar prominences are crucial for understanding their structure , magnetic support , and evolution .",
    "direct investigations of the magnetic fields in prominences started in the early 60s , using at first the zeeman effect @xcite , subsequently replaced by spectropolarimetry of prominences applying zeeman and hanle effect observations @xcite .",
    "the majority of the absolute field strength measurements in quiescent prominences revealed fields of less than 10 gauss , but some stronger local fields up to 70 gauss were also reported @xcite .",
    "it is worth to stress , that kuckein and co - workers reported recently 600 - 700 gauss magnetic fields in a filament ( @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite ) , ascribing low values of the earlier measurements to the lack of full stokes polarimetry .",
    "surges are active prominences that look like long straight or curved columns of plasma shot out from the solar surface with velocities up to a few hundred km  s@xmath10 @xcite , their typical density could be estimated as roughly @xmath11 g @xmath1 ( @xmath6=10@xmath8 - 10@xmath12 @xmath1 ) @xcite . the magnetic fields in active prominences ( like surges or sprays ) are less known than magnetic fields in quiescent ones @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of surges there exist some estimations of magnetic field strengths , ranging from a few up to a few tens of gauss @xcite .    direct observations and modeling of the magnetic fields in solar prominences",
    "are still difficult while the resolving power of the existing relevant observing facilities is substantially lower than the diameters of prominence subtle structures ( _ i.e. _ threads ) .",
    "thus , each opportunity for independent check of the obtained results should be explored . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we presented in detail a method of restoration of the true 3d trajectories of prominence knots using ground - based observations taken with a single telescope equipped with a _ multi - channel subtractive double pass _ ( msdp ) imaging spectrograph @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the method allows an evaluation of the true 3d trajectories of the prominence knots without any assumptions concerning the shape of trajectories or dynamics of the motion . in the present work",
    "we exploit the method for the determination of accelerations acting on observed plasma knots and for the estimation of lower limits of the magnetic fields channeling the observed plasma flows under the assumption that magnetic field configurations fully control plasma trajectories .",
    "we investigated 13 plasma knots recorded in two surges ( _ i.e. _ active prominences ) observed on july 7 , 2011 at the west limb of the sun , two quiescent prominences observed over the north - west solar limb on august 18 , 2011 and over the east solar limb on september 3 , 2011 , respectively , as well as an activated prominence observed over the north - west solar limb on september 1 , 2011 .",
    "spectrograms of the investigated prominences were collected with the large coronagraph equipped with an msdp imaging spectrograph at the biakw observatory of the university of wrocaw , poland .",
    "the coronagraph has a 51  cm entrance aperture and nearly 14.5 m effective focal length , its effective spatial resolution is limited by seeing only .",
    "the msdp spectrograph has a 9-channel _ prism - box _ and its spectral resolution is equal to 0.4  .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of an individual spectrograms is equal to ( @xmath13 ) on the sun .",
    "the numerical reduction of the raw spectrorgams was made using the standard msdp software designed by mein @xcite and our own auxiliary codes .",
    "after numerical processing we obtained for each spectrogram a compound file containing 13 quasi - monochromatic images encompassing the whole fov and separated by @xmath14  in wavelengths along the h@xmath3 line profile and the h@xmath3 line spectra for all pixels inside the fov ( in a range of @xmath15  from line center ) .",
    "series of consecutive individual quasi - monochromatic images ( up to 25 images per series ) are numerically `` combined '' into large - area images covering the whole investigated object ( like a prominence ) .",
    "the effective time resolution of the processed data is of the order of 15 - 60 seconds , depending on the size of the observed object .",
    "the images were co - aligned in a common triaxial reference frame having arbitrary oriented axes : _ x _ and _ y _ axes lie in the sky plane , _",
    "z_-axis is oriented outward the observer . _",
    "x - y _ positions of the knot are calculated on the consecutive images using the position of the centroid of the knot delimited by an arbitrary selected isophote ( usually the isophote of 70% of the brightest pixel ) ; the mean emission profiles of the knot are used to evaluate the line of sight ( los ) velocities of the material .",
    "subsequently , the 3d trajectories of the knots are calculated using a polynomial approximation of the obtained positions in the plane of the sky ( expressed in kilometers ) and los velocities ( in kilometers per second ) at discrete times and then by integration of the velocities the translation along the _",
    "z_-axis is obtained .",
    "the absolute starting positions of the knots along the _",
    "z_-axis could not be determined with our method and thus we assumed for each knot @xmath16 for starting or ending position .",
    "the detailed description of the applied reduction procedures was discussed in @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present version of the code automatically follows the positions of the selected knots on consecutive images , using simple knot identification and a tracking algorithm , which takes into account instantaneous changes of the brightness , shape and seeing - induced distortions of the knots .",
    "the code works completely autonomously after initiation , but due to the high rate of misidentifications , caused mainly by overlapping structures , all the results are examined by the observer to prevent bad tracking .",
    "an obvious extension of the code provides also the spatial velocity , the tangential ( along the trajectory ) and centripetal ( perpendicular to the trajectory ) accelerations of the observed plasma knots .",
    "the accelerations obtained for all investigated prominence knots are described in section [ res ] .",
    "using restored 3d trajectories of the individual knots we estimated the local magnetic fields of the prominences under the assumption that the magnetic field fully controls the observed trajectories of plasma knots .",
    "supposing the equipartition principle between magnetic and kinetic energy densities and disregarding an influence of gravitation and the viscosity we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the knot density , @xmath19 is the instantaneous spatial velocity of the knot and @xmath20 is the magnetic field for different times during the observation of an individual knot .",
    "we made similar consideration as ballester and kleczek @xcite for the motion of the knots in three dimentions and obtained the expression : @xmath21 which is the lower limit of the instantaneous magnetic field of the prominence .",
    "however , while variations of the diameters of magnetic flux ropes channeling the investigated knots are unknown , we present in graphical form field strengths calculated along the whole observed trajectory of each particular knot and in table  [ tab:18knots ] the highest and lowest values of the fields instead of giving a single minimal value .",
    "electron densities of the solar prominences estimated using various observational methods and theoretical models vary greatly ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the variations are caused both by differences between the various applied observational techniques and by real variations among individual prominences and various kinds of prominences @xcite . taking into account a broad range of the presented results , typical electron densities of the prominences could be characterized as 10@xmath22 - 10@xmath8 @xmath1 . while the estimated lower limits of the magnetic fields controlling prominences are proportional to the square root of the electron densities , we assumed in our calculations high , but reasonable electron densities of the plasma equal to @xmath23 @xmath1 in surges @xcite and @xmath24 @xmath1 in quiescent / activated prominences @xcite .",
    "time spans of the knots observations , extreme values of the measured accelerations and estimated limiting magnetic fields are presented concisely in table  [ tab:18knots ] .",
    "the errors of the measured _ x _ and _ y _ position of the knots ( _ i.e. _ positions measured in the sky plane ) were caused mainly by errors of the co - alignment of the consecutive images in the common triaxial reference frame .",
    "these errors were estimated as a standard deviation of the measured positions of selected stable objects ( like the solar limb in the _ x_-direction or selected structures in the prominences in the _ y_-direction ) .",
    "the errors of the _ x _ and _ y _ positions were usually less than 700 km , while the diameters of the investigated knots were of the order of @xmath25 km .",
    "the errors of the radial velocities were evaluated using the bootstrap method @xcite .",
    "they were mostly of the order of 0.5 km s@xmath10 , but in cases of very faint , barely visible knots they increased up to 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the errors of the _ z _ positions were estimated as the accumulation of the individual errors of all previous positions along the trajectory , usually reaching about 800 km per 1000 seconds of observations .",
    "error ranges of the accelerations and lower limits of the magnetic fields were calculated using bootstrap method also ; they are plotted by dashed lines on figures [ fig:07 g ] , [ fig:18 g ] , [ fig:01 g ] and [ fig:03 g ] .",
    "two surges were observed on july 7 , 2011 over the west limb of the sun , near noaa 11244 active region ( ar ) ( pa=@xmath26-@xmath27 ) .",
    "the observational data were collected between 05:22 ut and 17:06 ut with time cadence between 18 and 45 seconds , the total number of the processed multi - wavelength compound images is 766 .",
    "figure [ fig:072d ] presents a `` combined '' image taken during an early phase of the surge marked _ a _ at 15:58  ut in h@xmath3 line center with superimposed measured positions in the sky plane of the two knots forming the tips of both surges .",

    "knot a decelerated from @xmath28  km s@xmath10 to @xmath29  km s@xmath10 , knot b had a nearly constant velocity of @xmath30  km / s . however , the los component of the velocity was negative for knot a and positive for knot b. thus their trajectories observed in projection on the sky plane ( 2d ) looks nearly parallel , while in 3d they disperse toward and outward the observer .",
    "the tangential accelerations measured for both knots were negative , ranging from -150 m s@xmath31 to 0 m s@xmath31 .",
    "the centripetal accelerations varied between 50 m s@xmath31 and 250 m s@xmath31 ( excluding the starting and especially the ending parts of the observational period of _ a _ knot , when the calculated accelerations and magnetic fields are affected by side - effects of the polynomial approximation for the trajectory , which significantly increased estimated error ranges ) , see figure [ fig:07 g ] , left and middle panels .",
    "the values strongly affected by side - effects are marked with an asterisk in table [ tab:18knots ] .",
    "the minimum magnetic fields calculated along the trajectory of knot _ a _ range between 18 and 40 gauss , while for knot _ b _ they range from 16 to 34 gauss ( figure [ fig:07 g ] , right panel ) .",
    "the activated prominence was observed on august 18 , 2011 , from 08:27 ut up to 16:16 ut , over the north - west part of the solar limb ( pa=@xmath32-@xmath33 ) .",

    "the main body of the prominence , crossing the central meridian on august 11 , 2011 , was inclined by @xmath35 to the local meridian , thus the trajectories of the knots were inclined by @xmath36 to the prominence s body .",

    "we have presented 3d trajectories , velocities , tangential and centripetal accelerations of the plasma knots observed in solar prominences of various kinds ( surges , activated , and quiescent prominences ) , restored using single ground - based telescope and msdp spectrograph observations .",
    "the established parameters of the 3d ( spatial ) motions of the individual knots were applied to estimate lower limits of the magnetic fields channeling observed plasma flows under the assumption of the equipartition principle .",
    "the applied assumption is very strong , but it is consistent with contemporary prominence models assuming that local magnetic fields guide plasma flows and determine their geometry , being revealed by trajectories of the visible individual plasma knots or streams @xcite .",
    "we found also that the lower limits of the magnetic fields varied along the trajectories ( _ i.e. _ along the magnetic ropes ) .",
    "however , while the diameter variations of the magnetic ropes channeling investigated knots are unknown , no unique values of the magnetic field were calculated for the whole trajectories , but instant values along the trajectories only .",
    "the tangential accelerations of the knots observed in active and quiescent prominences ranged roughly from -100 m s@xmath31 to 80 m s@xmath31 , while in the case of two surges they range from -250 m s@xmath31 to -20 m s@xmath31 .",
    "the centripetal accelerations of the knots observed in active and quiescent prominences ranged roughly from 0  m  s@xmath31 to 100 m s@xmath31 , while for the two surges they ranged from 30 m s@xmath31 to @xmath41 m s@xmath31 .",
    "the measured accelerations are roughly similar to previously presented results @xcite .    assuming approximate typical electron densities of the plasma @xmath0  @xmath1 in surges and @xmath2 @xmath1 in quiescent / activated prominences @xcite we found that lower limits of the local magnetic fields in surges were equal to 16 - 40 gauss , while in activated and quiescent prominences were less than 10 gauss . in case",
    "if actual densities of the investigated prominences were smaller than assumed typical values applied in calculations , the obtained lower limits of the magnetic fields controlling prominences are slightly overestimated .",
    "most of the direct measurements of the solar prominence magnetic fields , made using various methods also revealed rather weak local magnetic fields , ranging from a few up to a few tens of gauss ( see the discussion in the introduction and references therein ) .",
    "however , as it was mentioned before , there were also some recent observations and numerical models reporting magnetic field strengths in the filaments of the order of 600 - 700 gauss @xcite .",
    "our result is consistent with previous detections of weak local magnetic fields in solar prominences , but , establishing the lower limits of the magnetic fields for a limited number of prominence knots only , we can not discard a possibility of strong fields in prominences .",

    "<S> the 3d trajectories , velocities , tangential and centripetal accelerations of the knots were reconstructed using observational data collected with a single ground - based telescope equipped with a _ multi - channel subtractive double pass _ imaging spectrograph . </S>",
    "<S> lower limits of magnetic fields channeling observed plasma flows were estimated under assumption of the equipartition principle . </S>",
    "<S> assuming approximate electron densities of the plasma @xmath0 @xmath1 in surges and @xmath2 @xmath1 in quiescent / activated prominences , we found that the magnetic fields channeling two observed surges range from 16 to 40 gauss , while in quiescent and activated prominences they were less than 10 gauss . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with previous detections of weak local magnetic fields in the solar prominences . </S>"
