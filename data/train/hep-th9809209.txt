    "we will follow the strategy put forward by t hooft @xcite who considered yang - mills theories on a euclidean space - time torus @xmath2 .",
    "the torus provides a gauge invariant infrared cut - off .",
    "its non - trivial topology gives rise to a non - trivial structure in the space of yang - mills fields which yields additional information on the possible phases of yang - mills theories .",
    "compared to other riemannian 4-dimensional compact manifolds the torus has many advantages ( besides being the ` space - time ' used in lattice simulations ) :    * one can use a flat metric in which case curvature effect do not mix with finite size effects , * the circumference @xmath3 in the temporal direction can be identified with the inverse temperature @xmath4 @xcite , * gauge invariant periodic fields on @xmath5 can be viewed as fields on @xmath2 , * one may calculate non - perturbative quantities from finite size effects @xcite ; the string constant is directly related to the energy of a string winding around the torus @xcite , * one keeps the relevant part of the supersymmetry in susy - ym theories .",
    "even the less ambitious goal to demonstrate confinement of static quarks without reliance on numerical simulations has not been achieved yet . without dynamical fermions",
    "the relevant observables are products of wilson - loops @xcite . at finite temperature @xmath6",
    "the gauge fields in the functional integrals are periodic in euclidean time i.e. @xmath7 and one may use polyakov loops @xcite    as order parameters for confinement . here",
    "@xmath8 is the representation of the gauge group which acts on the matter fields .",
    "we shall assume that the _ gauge group @xmath0 is simply connected _ , e.g. @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 .",
    "but since we allow for arbitrary representations @xmath8 of @xmath0 our results apply to general gauge groups @xmath11 , for example to @xmath12 .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath13 is invariant under gauge transformations which are periodic in time .",
    "since it is a functional of @xmath1 only , one is motivated to seek a gauge fixing where @xmath1 is as simple as possible .",
    "note that the weyl gauge , @xmath14 , is not compatible with time - periodicity . in a previous paper @xcite we discussed an extended abelian projection for @xmath15 gauge theories on the four torus in which @xmath1 is time independent and in the cartan subalgebra .",
    "the gauge fixing procedure hinges on the diagonalization of the path ordered exponential , @xmath16 , whose trace is the polyakov loop .",
    "in contrast to the two dimensional case investigated in @xcite the diagonalization procedure has unavoidable singularities @xcite . the singularities can be interpreted as dirac strings @xcite joining magnetically charged ` defects ' . here",
    "we understand defects as points , loops ( not to be confused with the dirac strings ! ) , sheets and lumps where @xmath16 has degenerate eigenvalues . for the gauge group @xmath15",
    ", the eigenvalues of @xmath16 are degenerate when @xmath17 .",
    "thus there are two types of defect according to whether @xmath16 is plus or minus the identity . associated with the gauge fixing procedure one can define an abelian magnetic potential @xmath18 on @xmath19 @xcite . in @xcite we showed that the total magnetic charge of @xmath20 defects is equal to the instanton number @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the total magnetic charge of all defects is zero , i.e. the total magnetic charge of @xmath22 defects is minus that of the @xmath20 defects .",

    "monopoles see the recent paper by jahn and lenz @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the defect analysis to gauge theories on @xmath2 with arbitrary gauge groups @xmath0 of rank @xmath24 .",
    "we also consider arbitrary twists @xcite , which allows us to treat matter transforming according to any representation of the gauge group .",
    "one has @xmath25 types of _ basic defects _ associated with the @xmath25 faces constituting the boundary of a ` fundamental domain ' ( these are essentially compactified weyl chambers ) in the root space . since the magnetic potential lies in the cartan subalgebra @xmath26 we now have a matrix @xmath27 of magnetic charges .",
    "the possible magnetic charges are quantized and are in one to one correspondence with the points of the integral co - root lattice . for a basic defect",

    "we have overall charge neutrality on @xmath19 unless there are non - orthogonal magnetic and electric twists .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the remainder of this section we recall some basic facts concerning gauge fields on @xmath2 .",
    "next we present a set of transition functions ( i.e. boundary conditions for the gauge fields ) where the instanton number is equal to the winding number of the mapping @xmath29 .",
    "these transition functions serve as the starting point for our gauge fixing . in section three",
    "we construct ` fundamental domains ' for all gauge groups .",
    "our lie algebra conventions are stated here .",
    "then we explain precisely what we mean by ` defects ' . in the next section",
    "we define the magnetic charge of the defects . our key result is given in section six . here",
    "we obtain the relationship between the magnetic charges and the instanton number .",
    "next we rewrite @xmath30 in terms of ` higgs fields ' .",
    "this enables us to tie up a loose end from section six , and also allows us to interpret the magnetic charges as higgs winding numbers . in section eight",
    "we show how the ideas apply to @xmath31 and give our conclusions in section nine .",
    "technicalities regarding our transition functions ( including a construction of magnetic twist eaters for all gauge groups ) can be found in appendix a. finally , an identity quoted in section six is derived in appendix b.    we view the four torus as @xmath5 modulo the lattice generated by four orthogonal vectors @xmath32 , for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "the euclidean lengths of the @xmath33 are denoted by @xmath34 ( we may identify @xmath3 with the inverse temperature @xmath4 ) .",
    "local gauge invariants such as @xmath35 are periodic with respect to a shift by an arbitrary lattice vector .",

    ". a center element @xmath42 is an allowed twist if @xmath43 .",
    "for example if we have matter fields in the defining representation of @xmath31 all the twists must be the identity , since the other two center elements are faithfully represented .",
    "by contrast , if the matter fields are in the adjoint representation of any group then there is no restriction on the twists . _ _    under a gauge transformation , @xmath44 , the pair @xmath45 is mapped to    the twists , @xmath40 , are gauge invariant .",
    "we define the topological charge or instanton number as follows    where the trace corresponds to the canonically normalized scalar product in the lie algebra .",
    "note that @xmath21 is fully determined by the transition functions @xcite .",
    "in particular , if we take all the transition functions to be the identity ( i.e. we assume the gauge fields are periodic in all directions ) then the instanton number is zero .",
    "accordingly , if we are to describe the non - perturbative sectors , one must consider non - trivial transition functions .",
    "for a given @xmath21 and set of twists , @xmath40 , we only require _ one _ set of transition functions . if we have two sets of transition functions with the same instanton number and twists then they are gauge equivalent @xcite .",
    "first we construct a convenient set of transition function such that the instanton number is equal to the winding number of the map @xmath46 .",
    "then we find the ( in general singular ) gauge transformation which transforms @xmath1 into a time - independent field in the cartan subalgebra.in the untwisted case , @xmath47 , we may assume that the transition functions have the following properties    in @xcite it was shown by explicit construction that there exist untwisted ( i.e. @xmath48 ) transition functions satisfying ( [ condition ] ) in all instanton sectors .",
    "the condition that @xmath49 is simply the statement that our gauge fields are periodic in time . since the transition functions are trivial on the time slice @xmath50 , and hence with ( [ condition ] ) also on the time slice @xmath51 , the path ordered exponential @xmath52 is periodic in the three spatial directions ( see ( [ polloopperiod ] ) ) .    in the presence of magnetic twists ( i.e. at least one of the @xmath53 )",
    "it is no longer possible to attain ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "however , one can still arrange for the transition functions to be independent of @xmath54 on the time slice @xmath50 . in appendix",
    "a we prove that there exist transition functions with the following properties    where the @xmath55 are independent of @xmath54 and satisfy the ` twist eating ' conditions    which follow from the cocycle conditions for the @xmath56 at time @xmath50 .",
    "for example , consider @xmath15 gauge theory with the following magnetic twists @xmath57 . then a possible choice of @xmath55 s is @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where the @xmath60 are the pauli matrices .",
    "twist eaters satisfying ( [ twisteaters ] ) are known to exist for arbitrary twists in @xmath61 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "twist eaters for the other simple lie groups are constructed in appendix a.    now we use the properties of the transition functions to obtain a relation for the instanton number in terms of the polyakov loop . consider the following gauge transformation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the path ordered exponential in ( [ defpol ] ) which in general is non - periodic in time .",
    "for brevity we use the notation    using ( [ polloopperiod],[newu],[condition ] ) , the gauge transformed transition functions are @xmath64 the new @xmath65 is simply the path ordered exponential @xmath66 , while the transformed spatial transition functions are constant matrices .",
    "applying the well know formula for the instanton number in terms of the transition functions @xcite yields    where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "we emphasize that ( [ polloopindex ] ) is only valid when the ( original ) transition function satisfy ( [ twistcondition ] )",
    ". another useful consequence of ( [ twistcondition ] ) is that @xmath69 has very simple periodicity properties ( + b_i)=z_0i_i^-1()_i , i=1,2,3.in particular , @xmath66 is completely periodic in the absence of twists .",
    "now we follow @xcite and seek a ( time - periodic ) gauge transformation , @xmath44 , for which the gauge transformed @xmath1 is independent of time and in the cartan subalgebra . consider the time - periodic gauge transformation    where @xmath70 is the path ordered exponential ( [ defpol ] ) , and @xmath71 diagonalizes @xmath66 , i.e.    with @xmath72 in the cartan subalgebra @xmath73 . the fractional power of @xmath74 is defined via the diagonalization of @xmath74 .",
    "it follows at once that the gauge transformed @xmath1 reads a_0^v = h(),which is indeed independent of time and in the cartan subalgebra . whereas @xmath66 is smooth the factors @xmath71 and @xmath75 in the decomposition ( [ diagonalization ] ) are in general not .",

    "some illustrative examples of the use of this formula are given in section 8 .",
    "0.2truecmto derive the results ( [ magneticcharge],[instantonno ] ) we assume that :    * there are no wall defects , i.e. @xmath206 there are no walls if @xmath207 is connected . ] * inside a defect the centralizer @xmath208 is uniform .",
    "the first assumption is a reflection of the fact that one can not surround a wall defect with a closed surface and so it is not obvious how to define the magnetic charge of such a defect .",
    "the second assumption is made to avoid the complication of ` defects within defects ' .",
    "it may be possible to drop this requirement .",
    "our arguments are based on the observation that    and furthermore    where the @xmath134-forms are    here @xmath209 is the least common multiple of the coxeter labels @xmath96 and as before @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "we prove this crucial identity in appendix b. these 2-forms are well defined outside the defects , because they are invariant under the residual abelian gauge transformations ( [ diagonalize ] ) .",
    "both terms in ( [ a ] ) may be singular at defects .",
    "however , in the following section we will show that @xmath212 can be singular only at defects on the @xmath120-plane or equivalently at defects whose centralizers have @xmath119 as root ,    actually , in ( [ a ] ) we could have subtracted an arbitrary constant lie algebra element from @xmath153 and ( [ aaa ] ) would still hold true .",
    "but the smoothness conditions ( [ regular ] ) only hold if this constant element is an extremal point of the fundamental domain and if @xmath213 is a center element .",
    "thus we take for @xmath209 in ( [ aaa ] ) the least common multiple of the coxeter labels @xmath96 . for example @xmath214 for the @xmath126 series and @xmath215 for the other classical groups .",
    "now we make use of ( [ aaa ] ) to relate the magnetic charges of the defects on the @xmath123-plane to the instanton number .",
    "away from defects on the @xmath123-plane @xmath216 is regular .",
    "now we surround each defect @xmath166 on the @xmath123-plane with a closed surface @xmath193 and pick a two form @xmath217 which is smooth inside @xmath193 , see fig.[instmon ] .",
    "since a defect can lie on at most @xmath24 of the @xmath25 faces constituting the boundary of @xmath84 there is always at least one such regular two form .",
    "= 5 cm    with ( [ topological],[aaa ] ) the instanton number reads    where , since @xmath216 is periodic on @xmath19 , we get no contributions from the ` boundary of the torus ' . using ( [ a ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath218 since the magnetic field @xmath219 is the projection to the cartan of @xmath220 we find    and end up with    where we used ( [ magncharge ] ) .",
    "the sum extends over defects on the inhomogeneous @xmath123-plane .",
    "let us have a closer look at the contribution    of a given defect on the @xmath123-plane .",
    "consider first a _ basic defect _ with minimal non - abelian centralizer .",
    "then all two forms @xmath221 are regular and must lead to the same contribution ( [ onedefect ] ) .",
    "we see at once that the magnetic charge must be proportional to @xmath95 , @xmath222 and it contributes @xmath203 to the instanton number .",
    "a non - basic defect on the inhomogeneous face must also lie on at least one of the homogeneous faces , say the @xmath122-plane .",
    "for such a defect we must not take the corresponding singular @xmath217 in ( [ instantonnu ] ) or @xmath223 in ( [ onedefect ] ) .",
    "we see that @xmath28 may be an integer linear combination of @xmath95 and @xmath224 .",
    "more generally , if the defect lies on the @xmath123-plane and several homogeneous planes , then    since a defect on the @xmath123-plane can at most sit on @xmath143 of the @xmath24 homogeneous planes , the representation ( [ chargedec ] ) for the magnetic charge is unique .",
    "outside of the defects we could have taken any @xmath212 instead of @xmath216 .",
    "then only defects on the @xmath120-plane would contribute to the instanton number and we would find @xmath225 again the contribution of a given defect must not depend on @xmath110 if the corresponding two form @xmath226 is regular on the defect . as above",
    "we conclude that the magnetic charge of a defect is in the co - root lattice of the defect centralizer ,    and that the instanton number is @xmath227",
    "in this section we consider a parametrization of @xmath228 in terms of static ` higgs ' fields .",
    "this may seem to be a backward step since we are encoding a smooth group - valued object , @xmath228 , in terms of @xmath25 , in general singular , lie algebra - valued fields .",
    "however the higgs fields facilitate a very direct proof that the @xmath229 @xmath134-forms introduced in the previous section have the stated smoothness properties .",
    "moreover , we shall see that the magnetic charges of the defects can be related to higgs winding numbers around the defects .",
    "one can define a ` basic ' higgs field , @xmath230 , as follows ( ) = ^(0 ) ( ) = w()h()w^-1().now , @xmath231 , is smooth everywhere except for the inhomogeneous @xmath123-plane .",
    "this follows because the centralizer of @xmath75 commutes with @xmath153 unless @xmath232 .",
    "it is possible to define ` alternative ' higgs fields which are smooth on the @xmath123-plane , but singular on one of the homogeneous @xmath122-planes , i.e. consider ^(i)=w()(h()- _ ( i)^h)w^-1(),i=1,2, ... ,r.@xmath96 being the @xmath122th coxeter label . the field @xmath233 is smooth everywhere except points on the @xmath122-plane .",
    "the relation between the polyakov loop and the alternative higgs fields is as follows @xmath234^{n_i}z_i=\\exp\\left[2\\pi i n_i \\phi^{(i)}(\\vx)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath235 is the center element @xmath236 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath25 higgs fields @xmath237 ` cover ' the group in the sense that it is possible to partition @xmath19 into patches , so that in each patch at least one of the higgs fields is smooth .    in the previous section we wrote @xmath238 as the derivative of two forms @xmath212 .",
    "we claimed that @xmath212 is only singular on the @xmath120-plane .",
    "in other words , wherever @xmath239 is smooth @xmath212 is smooth .",
    "this is obvious in the light of the following identity [ mainformula ] ^()= 12 ^ 2 ^2 ^1_0 ds ( s-1),where as before @xmath240 is the least common multiple of the coxeter labels into the integral and comparing with equation ( [ a ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can get it from the identity @xmath241 $ ] . ] .",
    "we now show that the magnetic field , @xmath219 can be written in terms of the higgs fields . using the fields",

    "since the centralizer of @xmath245 in @xmath0 is @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is semi - simple , the normalized higgs field @xmath242 induces a map from @xmath193 into a coset space @xmath248 with @xmath249 .",
    "that is to each normalized higgs field @xmath250 there is _ one _ associated winding number which can be identified with @xmath251 .",
    "for @xmath61 all the coxeter labels are unity , and so @xmath252 for the groups @xmath132 , @xmath127 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 it seems that the magnetic field can not be written trilinearly in normalised fields since ( [ final ] ) only applies if the relevant coxeter label is one .",
    "for example the gauge group @xmath255 has only one unit coxeter label , @xmath256 .",
    "however , the weyl orbit of @xmath257 contains a linearly independent basis of the root space . to make this more concrete , consider the field @xmath258 a simple calculation shows that @xmath259 if and only if    clearly , @xmath260 is a solution of ( [ cubic ] ) if and only if @xmath261 .",
    "but there are other solutions of ( [ cubic ] ) apart from the co - weights with unit coxeter ; these correspond to weyl reflections of the co - weights .",
    "in fact for @xmath132 , @xmath127 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 one can always find @xmath24 linearly independent solutions of ( [ cubic ] ) which we denote by @xmath262 .",
    "thus we have @xmath263 where now @xmath264 , and the @xmath265 are dual to the @xmath266 in the sense that @xmath267 ( the @xmath265 are roots or weyl reflections thereof ) .",
    "to each normalized higgs field @xmath250 there is _ one _ associated winding number which can be identified with @xmath268 .    for the groups @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath137 no solutions of ( [ cubic ] ) exist .",
    "[ examples ]    in this section we illustrate the ideas of the previous sections by considering the relevant gauge group @xmath31 . in the instanton number calculation of chapter 6 we assumed that our matter transformed according to the covering group . here",
    "we will also consider the case of matter in the adjoint representation by allowing for twists .",
    "first we consider @xmath31 with untwisted gauge fields , i.e. the polyakov loop operator in the defining representation .",
    "the fundamental domain @xmath84 has been depicted in figs.([su3]a,[bild5 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic charges of the three types of defects corresponding to the three edges of @xmath84 are integer multiples of @xmath271 because of overall charge neutrality the magnetic charges of all defects must add up to zero , @xmath272    = 4.5 cm    any cluster of magnetic monopoles connected by a dirac string has vanishing magnetic charge .",
    "for example , if a monopole pair is uncharged no dirac string , besides the one connecting the two monopoles , is needed . since defects on the @xmath123-plane for which @xmath273 ( ignoring ` higher defects ' ) contribute to the instanton number",
    "as @xmath274 the monopole pair connected by a string in fig.[bild5 ] does not contribute to the instanton number .",
    "the three monopoles connected by a dirac string contribute @xmath275 to the instanton number .    what about defects with larger centralizers ? if @xmath276 , in which case @xmath153 lies at an extremal point of @xmath84 in fig.[bild5 ] , then @xmath74 has maximal degeneracy and the centralizer is @xmath135 .",
    "such a defect has magnetic charge @xmath277 and contributes with @xmath278 to the instanton number .",
    "finally , let us switch to the adjoint representation . in principle",
    "we could do this by restricting @xmath153 to the fundamental domain for the adjoint representation , see the shaded regions in fig.[su3 ] . however",
    "this would lead to walls on which @xmath279 is not smooth .",
    "a much easier approach is to work in the covering group _ but now with arbitrary twists . _ in general this leads to a fractional instanton number .",
    "such fractional instanton numbers are related to a loss of charge neutrality and nonperiodicity of @xmath280 engendered by the twists .    for example",
    "consider the following set of twists @xmath281 \\id = \\exp[2 \\pi i \\mu_{(1)}^\\vee \\cdot h ] , z_{23}=\\exp[2\\pi i/3 ] \\id = \\exp[2 \\pi i \\mu_{(2)}^\\vee \\cdot h ] $ ] , and all other twists the identity .",
    "this is an example of non - orthogonal twists , and leads to an instanton number of the form @xmath282 where @xmath283 . from the periodicity properties of @xmath284 @xmath285 we obtain periodicity properties of @xmath286 ,",
    "@xmath287 $ ] and @xmath288 . in our example",
    "we get @xmath289 where @xmath290 and @xmath291 corresponds to an element of the weyl group , here a rotation of @xmath292 .",
    "the equation can be understood as follows . by multiplying @xmath293 with @xmath294 we shift @xmath295 by the vector @xmath296 .",
    "then we have to weyl reflect this shifted vector back into the fundamental domain @xmath297 with @xmath291 . in @xmath297 itself",
    "this corresponds to a rotation with angle @xmath298 around the center of the equilateral triangle @xmath297 .",
    "it follows that we get charge neutrality in the ` tripled ' torus obtained by taking three adjoining tori in the @xmath299-direction .",
    "if we have in the first torus a defect of one type then in the adjoining torus in the @xmath300 direction we have a defect with the next type of charge and so on , see fig.[b2 ] .",

    "we obtain periodicity of the magnetic field strength @xmath310 in the @xmath311- and @xmath312-directions and @xmath313 . to calculate the topological index @xmath314 we may use the 2-forms @xmath315 , but now we will get contributions from the ` boundary ' of the torus .",
    "this is in contrast to the non twisted case where we have had no contributions from the boundary because of the periodicity of @xmath316 .",

    "the path ordered exponential , @xmath325 , which is central to the gauge fixing , is periodic up to multiplication by constant matrices , even though of course the gauge field itself is non - periodic .",

    "we have fixed the freedom in choosing the gauge transformation by restricting @xmath1 to a fundamental domain in the cartan subalgebra . in the sectors with non - vanishing instanton number the final gauge fixed potential must have singularities @xcite .",

    "the results for @xmath15 may be misleading ; at the defects the polyakov loop operator need not be in the center of the gauge group as it must for @xmath15 . for example , for @xmath327 the center is trivial but there are many different types of defects corresponding to the different faces of the fundamental domain .",
    "the magnetic charges of the defects are quantized and linearly related to the points of the integral co - root lattice .",
    "for all groups with nontrivial centers we have constructed @xmath24 normalized higgs fields which wind around the magnetized defects .",
    "finally we generalized earlier results in @xcite and related the magnetic charges of a given type of defect to the instanton number @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath328 then all possible magnetic defects must appear .",

    "yet unlike the weyl gauge we find monopole like singularities .",
    "this is gratifying , since in those theories where we analytically understand confinement , the latter is due to the condensation of monopoles ; these examples are compact @xmath329 @xcite and supersymmetric yang - mills theories @xcite .",

    "we thank r. jackiw for bringing @xcite , in which the relation between magnetic charges and the instanton number has been discovered , to our attention .",
