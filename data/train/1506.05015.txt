    "the quark model @xcite can reproduce the behavior of observables such as the spectrum and the magnetic moments in the baryon and meson sector , but it neglects quark - antiquark pair - creation ( or continuum - coupling ) effects . above threshold ,",
    "these couplings lead to strong decays and below threshold , they lead to virtual @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) components in the hadron wave function and shifts of the physical mass with respect to the bare mass .",
    "the unquenching of the quark model for hadrons is a way to take these components into account .",
    "pioneering works on the unquenching of quark model were done by trnqvist and collaborators , who used an unitarized qm @xcite , while van beveren and rupp used an t - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "these methods were used ( with a few variations ) by several authors to study the influence of the meson - meson ( meson - baryon ) continuum on meson ( baryon ) observables .",
    "these techniques were applied to study of the scalar meson nonet ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , etc . ) of ref .",

    "it is via these hadronic loops that the bare states become `` dressed '' and the hadronic loop contributions totally dominate the dynamics of the process . on the other hand , isgur and coworkers in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the effects of the @xmath0 sea pairs in meson spectroscopy is simply a renormalization of the meson string tension .",

    ", we discuss some of the latest applications of the uqm ( the approach is a generalization of the unitarized quark model @xcite ) to study the flavor asymmetry and strangeness of the proton , in wich the effects of the quark - antiquark pairs were introduced into the constituent quark model ( cqm ) in a systematic way and the wave fuctions were given explicitly .",
    "finally , the uqm is applied to describe meson observables and the spectroscopy of the charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "in the unquenched quark model for baryons @xcite and mesons @xcite , the hadron wave function is made up of a zeroth order @xmath6 ( @xmath0 ) configuration plus a sum over the possible higher fock components , due to the creation of @xmath1 @xmath0 pairs .",

    "it is worthwhile noting that in refs .",
    "@xcite , the constant pair - creation strength in the operator ( [ eqn : psi - a ] ) was substituted with an effective one , to suppress unphysical heavy quark pair - creation .",

    "the result will receive a contribution from the valence part and one from the continuum component , which is absent in naive qm calculations .",
    "the introduction of continuum effects in the qm can thus be essential to study observables that only depend on @xmath0 sea pairs , like the strangeness content of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors @xcite or the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea @xcite .",
    "in other cases , continuum effects can provide important corrections to baryon / meson observables , like the self - energy corrections to meson masses @xcite or the importance of the orbital angular momentum in the spin of the proton @xcite .",

    "our results in the meson sector for the self energies corrections of charmonium and bottomonium spectra , see figures [ charm ] and [ botton ] , show that the pair - creation effects on the spectrum of heavy mesons are quite small . specifically for charmonium and bottomonium states ,",
    "they are of the order of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . the relative mass shifts , i.e. the difference between the self energies of two meson states , are in the order of a few tens of mev .",
    "however , as qm s can predict the meson masses with relatively high precision in the heavy quark sector , even these corrections can become significant .",
    "these results are particularly interesting in the case of states close to an open - flavor decay threshold , like the @xmath48 and @xmath49 mesons . in our picture",
    "the @xmath48 can be interpreted as a @xmath42 core [ the @xmath50 , plus higher fock components due to the coupling to the meson - meson continuum . in ref .",

    "the flavor asymmetry in the proton can be well described by the uqm .",
    "the effects of the continuum components on the `` strangeness '' observables of the proton are found to be negligible",
