    "the standard model of elementary particle physics ( sm ) gives an excellent explanation of all existing experimental data . however , there are quite strong theoretical motivations to believe that the sm is an effective theory of a more fundamental theory and that the gauge couplings of @xmath16 have a common origin .",
    "the construction of grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite , which unify @xmath17 gauge interactions in a single non abelian group [ @xmath2 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 etc ] , give an elegant explanation of charge quantization and also unify quark - lepton families .",
    "the idea of gut got a great support from the fact that the three gauge couplings measured at that early times were indeed unifying at energies near @xmath20  gev @xcite .",
    "progress in measuring the strong gauge coupling and also the weak mixing angle @xmath21 with higher accuracy has ruled out the minimal @xmath2 gut [ and also minimal @xmath18 without intermediate scale ] from the viewpoint of coupling unification @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) and also the minimal susy @xmath2 gut @xcite(which except for gut threshold corrections both have the same pattern of running of couplings below @xmath22 ) were giving values for the @xmath23 coupling @xcite-@xcite well within the experimental limits at that time . indeed",
    "since susy theories stabilize hierarchies , for realistic model building supersymmetry might be the best way to proceed .",
    "it is assumed , that the susy breaking scale @xmath24 lies in a range @xmath25  gev - few tev and below this characteristic scale the theory is just the sm with minimal particle content except the higgs sector , while above the @xmath24 scale the theory is supersymmetric . despite these nice features of susy theories ,",
    "there are various puzzles and problems , which are connected with susy guts and we will list some of them here .    * ( i ) * baryon number violation is a particular feature of guts such as @xmath2 , @xmath18 . since for susy guts the unification scale @xmath26  gev is larger than for non susy guts , the gauge mediated @xmath27 nucleon decay is compatible with the latest superkamiokande ( sk ) limit @xmath28 yrs @xcite .",
    "however , with susy there is a new source for nucleon decay through @xmath29 operators , which makes the minimal @xmath2 and @xmath18 scenarios incompatible @xcite with sk data .    *",
    "( ii ) * the unified multiplets of minimal @xmath2 lead to the wrong asymptotic mass relations @xmath30 . in the minimal @xmath18",
    "the situation is even worse , since @xmath31 and @xmath32 is predicted .    *",
    "( iii ) * the problem of doublet - triplet ( dt ) splitting in the higgs supermultiplet still needs to be resolved . in guts ,",
    "the mssm higgs doublets are usually accompanied by colored triplets . in order to maintain coupling unification and reasonably stable nucleons",
    "[ triplets could induce nucleon decay through @xmath29 operators , see * ( i ) * ] , triplet components must be superheavy .",
    "so , one should provide a natural explanation of the fact that sometimes states ( higgs doublets and colored triplets ) coming from the same gut multiplet are split with a huge mass gap @xmath33 .",
    "* ( iv ) * the spontaneous breaking of the gut symmetry requires scalars in a high representation of the gauge group considered ; thus the superpotential , responsible for symmetry breaking , contains many unknown parameters and usually looks rather complicated .    *",
    "( v ) * the so - called @xmath0 problem exists even within the mssm .",
    "4d superpotential couplings allow a @xmath34 term , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the mssm higgs doublets and @xmath37 is some mass close to the cutoff scale of the theory .",
    "so , somehow large values for @xmath38(@xmath39 ) must be avoided . in order to have the desired electroweak symmetry breaking and a reasonable phenomenology ,",
    "a @xmath0 term of the magnitude @xmath40  gev - few tev has to be generated in a good model ( also within guts after solution of the dt splitting problem * ( iii * ) and having succeeded to obtain @xmath41 ) .",
    "* ( vi ) * recent atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino sk data have confirmed neutrino oscillations .",
    "the explanation of the atmospheric anomaly ( by a characteristic mass squared scale @xmath42  ev@xmath43 ) already forces us to step beyond the mssm and the minimal susy @xmath2 ( a neutrino mass @xmath44  ev can be generated through planck scale @xmath29 operators and can explain the solar anomaly through large angle vacuum oscillations .",
    "however , this solution is disfavored by the sk data ) .",
    "in order to have neutrinos with masses @xmath45  ev , the lepton number must be violated by a proper amount .",
    "this requires considering extensions of the mssm and the minimal susy @xmath2",
    ". it would be most welcome if the considered model would contain a source for the needed lepton number violation .    *",
    "( vii ) * very accurate measurements of @xmath23 @xcite already allow to judge whether a given gut scenario is viable or not .",
    "two loop renormalization studies of the mssm ( with all susy particles near the @xmath46 scale ) predict @xmath47 @xcite , which contradicts the experimental @xmath48 @xcite . this situation can be improved either by pushing all susy particle masses up to the @xmath49  tev mass scale @xcite , or by some gut threshold corrections . with the latter the minimal susy @xmath2 does not give any promising results @xcite . comparing gut scenarios ,",
    "those would be considered more attractive which , without constraining the susy particle mass spectra , give acceptable values for the strong coupling .    on the theoretical side",
    "quite a few new possibilities have been found since the early days of guts and also the introduction of susy .    *",
    "@xmath50 ) * string theory is primarily a theory of ( super)gravity but it also contains in a less unique manner matter and gauge fields .",
    "it had an enormous effect on the taste of model builders although concrete phenomenological results are still not obvious .",
    "we particularly mention symmetry breaking mechanisms not requiring very high higgs representations of the gut gauge groups and a natural assignment of fundamental representation to matter .",
    "also the possibility to calculate ( in principle ! ) yukawa couplings is very impressive .",
    "but unfortunately there is a huge and even increasing number of string vacua with ( presently ) no possibility to make a choice of one or the other except for phenomenological reasons .",
    "still until recently @xcite it was notoriously difficult to find a string model realization implementing the sm with three generations .    *",
    "@xmath51 ) * extra dimensions : the kaluza - klein use of extra dimensions to be curled up one way or the other had several renaissances .",
    "of course it is very tempting to obtain extra model informations from some extra dimensions - there is plenty of space in this dreamland , which can contain geometry / topology . in string",
    "theory extra dimensions are mandatory for consistency .",
    "a drawback then seems to be that such extra dimensions would show up only at the string scale which is normally identified with the planck scale of our gravity .",
    "one then is led to talk about physics which presumably never will be tested in the laboratory .",
    "recently it became a point of common interest whether the string scale might be as low as the tev scale @xcite still allowing for our gravity scale . in this case",
    "higher dimensions should show up soon in experiments @xcite .    *",
    "@xmath52 ) * it was exciting news that dualities connect the various types of string theories @xcite .",
    "the open string picture allows for @xmath53-branes which contain our 3-dimensional space but also allow for some extra dimensions which may be curled up or projected out in the case of intersecting branes .",
    "this version of string theory may be particularly appropriate also in the case of singular points of divided out symmetries for an approximation by a description in local quantum field theory language since there are no winding states .    in resolving problems * ( i)-(iv ) * of susy gut scenarios the orbifold constructions seem to be very promising @xcite-@xcite . in the original paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , a five dimensional ( 5d ) @xmath3 susy @xmath2 gut on an @xmath54 orbifold was considered . due to this construction",
    ", it turns out that the problems * ( i)*-*(iv ) * can be resolved in a very natural way for a wide class of unified models @xcite-@xcite , while * ( v)*-*(vii ) * still depend on peculiarities of the scenario considered and will be discussed in more detail below . due to specific boundary conditions , it is possible to mod out selected sub - states from a given gut representation . through this self consistent procedure ,",
    "it is possible to obtain the desired gut symmetry breaking , nucleon stability and natural dt splitting .    in the last years",
    ", theories with extra dimensions have attracted great attention .",
    "originally the main phenomenological motivation was the possibility to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem without supersymmetry .",
    "it was observed @xcite , that due to sufficiently large extra dimensions , it is possible to lower the fundamental scale @xmath55 even down to a few tev ( indeed , this can be an excellent starting point for understanding the electroweak scale ) , while the 4d planck mass still has the required value @xmath56  gev . due to the large extra dimensions , newton s law could be modified at short distances where the behavior of gravity is still unknown and is studied in ongoing experiments @xcite . similarly and perhaps with a richer phenomenology @xcite , one can study the spectrum for scenarios with a string scale of a few tev @xcite .",
    "it turned out , that the presence of extra dimensions can play a crucial role also for obtaining low scale unification of gauge couplings @xcite-@xcite through power law running @xcite .",
    "the construction of realistic gut scenarios with low scale unification raises the hope that phenomenological implications can be detected .",
    "however , the orbifold gut scenarios considered up to now do not allow for low scale unification @xcite , @xcite because in these settings the gut symmetry is restored at energies higher than the compactification scale .",
    "thus full gut multiplets [ either of @xmath2 or @xmath6 will participate in the running and power law unification does not take place .",
    "relatively low scales @xmath57  gev are also preferable for lepton number violation .",
    "one way for obtaining unification on a scale much below @xmath10  gev is to consider either gut models with product groups or with ( intermediate ) stages of symmetry breaking - step by step compactification of more than one extra dimension . on the gut scale @xmath22",
    "a first step compactification ( @xmath58 ) takes place and the unified group @xmath59 reduces to its subgroup @xmath60 . in the second step compactification , whose scale @xmath61 is below @xmath22 , the subgroup @xmath60 is broken . if @xmath60 is different from @xmath2 and if the states are non complete multiplets of @xmath2 , then due to their contribution to the running between @xmath62 and @xmath22 there can appear power law unification on intermediate or low scales .    in this paper",
    "we consider 5d @xmath3 susy models with orbifold compactifications .",
    "we start our discussion with the standard model @xmath17 gauge group and an @xmath1 orbifold . in order to have a model without the phenomenological problems * ( i)*-*(vi ) * [ in this case except the * ( ii)*-*(iv ) * of course ] , we introduce a discrete @xmath11 symmetry which elegantly resolves problems * ( i ) * , * ( v ) * and replacing matter @xmath63 parity allows for some lepton number violating couplings which can generate neutrino masses .",
    "thus , * ( vi ) * also can be resolved .",
    "we confirm that , with the mssm states plus appropriate kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations , successful unification holds only for @xmath64  gev .",
    "low scale unification requires either some extensions @xcite , @xcite or the existence of specific threshold corrections @xcite .",
    "similarly we can discuss 5d @xmath3 susy @xmath2 gut on an @xmath54 orbifold . in this setting the problems * ( ii)*-*(iv ) * are resolved naturally , while * ( i ) * , * ( v ) * will again be resolved by introducing a discrete symmetry @xmath11 . as far as the gauge coupling unification is concerned , all states including matter supermultiplets and their copies form full @xmath2 multiplets above the compactification scale . because of this , low and intermediate scale unification can not take place .",
    "then we address the question whether power law unification is possible or not ( at low or intermediate scale ) within the orbifold gut construction .",
    "we emphasize the possibility of a so - called step by step compactification with an intermediate gauge group , different from the @xmath2 in structure and field content .",
    "this potentially allows for power law unification . besides the latter",
    "a quite different and peculiar phenomenology can arise . to demonstrate this we consider pati - salam @xmath65 @xcite and flipped @xmath66 guts .",
    "both these gauge groups are maximal subgroups of @xmath18 @xcite , @xcite and thus one could imagine that they are produced in a first step breaking of @xmath18 in six dimensions by the compactification of one dimension . within 5d @xmath3 susy @xmath8 and @xmath9 models an extension with a discrete @xmath11 symmetry is needed for a simultaneous solution of the problems * ( i)*-*(vi)*. these models involve sm singlet right handed states which are necessary for the breaking of the rank and obtaining the @xmath17 gauge group . in combination with the @xmath11 symmetry , these singlet states also play a crucial role in understanding of problems * ( i ) * , * ( v ) * , * ( vi)*. they are also tied with lepton number violation and the generation of an intermediate symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the @xmath8 model allows to lower the unification scale not only down to intermediate scales , but even down to the multi tev region .",
    "differently , within @xmath9 the unification scale is close to @xmath10  gev .",
    "the models considered have some peculiar phenomenological implications testable in the future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the main construction principles of the models considered . in section 3 we write the needed one loop renormalization - group equations ( rge ) . using them we study gauge coupling unification within various models , in the presence of kk states .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the 5d orbifold @xmath3 susy @xmath17 and the @xmath2 models resp . in section 6",
    "we discuss the issue of power law unification , within orbifold gut scenarios , and outline the ways of its realization . in sections 7 and 8",
    "pati - salam @xmath8 and flipped @xmath67 guts resp .",
    "are studied on an @xmath7 orbifold .",
    "finally discussions and conclusions are presented in section 9 .",
    "the paper contains an appendix a , in which the influence of some brane couplings on the gauge coupling running is estimated .",
    "in this section we present our construction principles of 5d susy theories . as we will see they are divided into two categories : principles which are related to the higher dimensionality and others which deal with problems existing on the 4d level , after dimensional reduction .",
    "* @xmath68 . 5d susy action *    we start the construction with a 5d @xmath3 susy theory . from the viewpoint of 4d",
    "( with coordinates @xmath69 ) , with the fifth coordinate @xmath70 as a parameter , it is equivalent to @xmath71 susy . @xmath71 supermultiplets can be expressed in terms of the usual 4d @xmath3 supermultiplets @xcite : a gauge supermultiplet @xmath72 contains the 4d @xmath3 vector superfield @xmath73 and the chiral superfield @xmath74 , both in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath59 and depending on the fifth coordinate .",
    "the 5d matter superfield , in 4d language , is the @xmath71 chiral supermultiplet @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the @xmath3 chiral superfield and @xmath77 is it s conjugate -the so - called mirror ( through out the paper the mirrors will be denoted by an overline ) .",
    "so , if @xmath78 is in some irreducible representation @xmath79 of @xmath59 , then @xmath77 will be in an antirepresentation @xmath80 of @xmath59 .    under gauge transformations",
    "one has @xmath81",
    "e^  ,   e^-  , where @xmath82 is a chiral superfield .",
    "the transformation of @xmath74 in ( [ n2gaugetr ] ) reflects the 5d gauge invariance , since @xmath74 contains the fifth component of the five dimensional gauge field @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the 5d action can be written in terms of 4d @xmath3 superfields @xcite and has the form s^(5)=d^5x(l^(5)_v+l^(5 ) _ ) , where @xmath83 d^4(_5v+^+)e^-v ( -_5v+)e^v+ _ 5e^-v_5e^v  , ^(5)_=d^4^+e^-v+ e^v^+ + d^2m_+_5-+ h.c .. here @xmath84 is the field strength supermultiplet , also in the adjoint representation of @xmath59 and built from @xmath73 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the last term in ( [ lagf ] ) contains the @xmath86-term of @xmath87 , which is crucial for 5d lorentz invariance : for a bosonic component @xmath88 of the @xmath78 superfield it produces the term @xmath89 which together with @xmath90 [ coming from the first coupling in ( [ lagf ] ) ] is 5d lorentz invariant .",
    "the same happens for the fermionic components .",
    "the @xmath91 combination is crucial for the 5d gauge invariance under ( [ n2gaugetr ] ) .",
    "there are two supersymmetries in @xmath92 , the obvious 4d @xmath3 susy and one related by a global @xmath93 symmetry to the former one @xcite .",
    "thus the susy transformation parameters as well as the scalar components of @xmath94 and the two spinors @xmath95 in @xmath84 and @xmath74 form doublets under this @xmath93 .",
    "the fermionic components of @xmath94 and the bosonic components of @xmath84 and @xmath74 are @xmath93 singlets .",
    "the @xmath3 susy theory in 5d has the advantage that there is no free superpotential .",
    "the action is completely fixed except for the @xmath96 term in ( [ lagf ] ) which in some cases might be forbidden by orbifold parities ( see below ) .",
    "the @xmath96 only connects fields with their mirrors .",
    "* @xmath97 .",
    "compactification and orbifold symmetries *    since we have one extra dimension , it is important somehow to reduce the theory to the 4d one .",
    "one can start from a @xmath98 theory , where @xmath99 is the four dimensional minkowski space - time and @xmath100 a compact circle .",
    "equivalently , one can consider the fifth dimension as an infinite @xmath101 line and impose some periodicity @xmath102 , where @xmath63 is the radius of the circle corresponding to the characteristic compactification scale @xmath103 .",
    "so , the theory in the fifth dimension is defined on a interval @xmath104 $ ] or equivalently on @xmath105 $ ] . on the interval",
    "@xmath106 one can introduce discrete symmetries , and @xmath107 is the simplest one    z_2  :  y - y  , which folds the circle .",
    "the theory is then built on an @xmath1 orbifold . under ( [ z2orbsym ] ) all introduced fields",
    "@xmath108 should have definite parity transformation properties @xmath109 , such that the 5d lagrangian ( [ lagv ] ) , ( [ lagf ] ) is invariant ( @xmath108 designates all gauge and matter supermultiplets we have ) .",
    "@xmath110 and the mode expansions of states @xmath111 and @xmath112 with positive and negative parities resp . have the form    _ + ( x , y)=_n=0^^(n)_+(x )  ,   _ -(x , y)=_n=1^^(n)_-(x )  , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are kaluza - klein ( kk ) states .",
    "as we see , @xmath115 does not contain a zero mode .",
    "massive kk modes have masses @xmath116 .",
    "we have two fixed points @xmath117 and @xmath118 . with the help of the @xmath107 orbifold parity it is possible to project out some states ( assigning them negative parities ) and to achieve the breaking of supersymmetries and gauge symmetries .",
    "if we wish to break the gauge group @xmath59 down to its subgroup @xmath60 , gauge fields @xmath119 should have negative parities , while the parities of fragments @xmath120 are positive . from ( [ lagv ] ) , it is clear that in this case @xmath121=-1 $ ] and @xmath122=+1 $ ] ( because @xmath123 changes sign under @xmath107 ) .",
    "also , it follows from ( [ lagf ] ) that mirrors must have opposite parities .",
    "because of all this , together with the gauge symmetry , half of the susy is broken and at the fixed points we have a @xmath124 @xmath3 susy theory with a reduced gauge group .",
    "but we are also left with the additional zero mode states of @xmath125 . in order to avoid them ,",
    "the orbifold symmetry can be extended to @xmath126 @xcite : by additional folding of the half circle z_2  :  y - y  ,  z_2  :  y-y  , where @xmath127 , one can ascribe negative @xmath128 parity to @xmath125 and @xmath128 charge for @xmath119 .",
    "now the theory is defined on an @xmath7 orbifold and at the @xmath117 fixed point ( identified with our 4d world @xmath129-brane ) we have a 4d @xmath3 susy theory with gauge group @xmath60 .",
    "no additional fragments of @xmath74 with zero mode wave functions emerge . of course ,",

    "only the @xmath143 states contain massless zero modes .",
    "states with other parities are massive .",
    "we emphasize again that , if we introduce states in the bulk and ascribe to them some parity @xmath144 , the mirror must carry @xmath145 parity . in this way we have 5d lorentz invariance .",
    "this is quite different when a state is fully restricted to the brane and does not have kk excitations ( as possibly chiral matter in some cases which we will consider below ) .",

    "the couplings in ( [ branesup ] ) do not violate the higher supersymmetries and gauge symmetries of the 5d bulk .",
    "the reason for this is that the wave functions of generators which transform zero mode states to states with negative orbifold parities vanish in the 4d fixed point . in this way",
    "the whole theory is self consistent .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the introduction , the orbifold constructions have big advantages in resolving various puzzles connected with guts . however",

    ", we explicitly demonstrate how the generation of @xmath149 , @xmath148 vevs and the @xmath0 term suppression are realized .",
    "the mssm and the minimal susy @xmath2 require @xmath148 , @xmath149 singlets , while the models @xmath153 and flipped @xmath67 automatically involve scalars being singlets of the mssm ( see sections 7 , 8) .    in the mssm and susy guts ,",
    "usually a @xmath107 @xmath63-parity is assumed , which distinguishes matter and scalar superfields and avoids baryon number and large lepton number violation . in our approach , for the same purpose we use the @xmath11 symmetry , which avoids all baryon number violating couplings which also violate @xmath63 parity . with help of the introduced @xmath11 symmetry",
    "we also avoid @xmath29 and @xmath27 baryon number violating planck scale operators , which are otherwise allowed on the 4d level , causing unacceptably rapid nucleon decay ( @xmath27 operators become dangerous if we are dealing with low or intermediate scale theories ) .",

    "this opens up new and interesting possibilities from the viewpoints of unification and phenomenological implications .",
    "for extended guts , symmetry breaking can occur by a step by step compactification and if the intermediate gauge group differs from semisimple @xmath2 , power law unification can take place . as an example we have considered the two maximal subgroups of @xmath18 - the pati - salam @xmath8 and flipped @xmath9 guts . within @xmath8 ,",

    "two loop power law contributions to the @xmath51-function would contribute significantly .",

    "let us assign the orbifold parities as    ( e ,  )~*+ *  ,  ( e ,  ) ~*- *  .",

    "these conclusions are valid for any value of @xmath702 .",
