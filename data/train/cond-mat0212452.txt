    "various classes of enzymes , usually termed motor proteins , play important roles in biological processes such as cellular transport , cell division , muscle function and genetic transcription ( see , e.g. , lodish et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "what we may term _ translocatory _ motor proteins ( in contrast to rotary motor proteins ) are epitomized by kinesins , dyneins , myosins , and dna and rna polymerases that move under loads along polar linear tracks such as microtubules , actin filaments , and double - stranded dna , the motion being fueled by the hydrolysis of atp or related reactions .",
    "motor proteins may work collectively in large groups , like myosin in muscles , or they may operate individually as do most microtubule - based kinesin and dynein molecules ( leibler and huse , 1993 ; howard , 2001 ) . those motor proteins that function collectively are typically _ non_processive , i.e. , they make at most one mechanical step along their tracks during a catalytic cycle before detaching from the track . on the other hand , individual motors that move vesicles over long distances ( up to several microns ) need to stay bound to their tracks over many catalytic cycles : such motors are _",

    "we will focus on the dynamics of myosin - v .",
    "myosin - v is a dimeric , two - headed molecule that in the presence of actin readily hydrolyzes atp to produce adp and p@xmath1 ( mehta , 2001 ) .",

    "the principle experimental findings can be summarized as follows :   ( i ) myosin - v moves along actin filaments towards the plus or barbed end taking large steps of size averaging 35 - 38 nm ( mehta _ et al .",

    "d \\langle x(t ) \\rangle /dt\\ ] ] follows a michaelis - menten form in that it is proportional to [ atp ] at low concentrations but becomes independent of [ atp ] under saturating conditions ;  ( iv ) tight coupling between chemical and mechanical cycles is valid , with one atp molecule hydrolyzed per individual myosin - v forward step along an actin filament ; but  ( v ) in contrast to the dynamics of conventional kinesin ( coppin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; visscher _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) , myosin - v under load not infrequently exhibits sequences of two or three reverse or backward steps ; and , finally ,  ( vi ) the addition of adp to the _ in vitro _",
    "solution significantly reduces the turnover rate of atp ( as is to be expected ) ; moreover , the inhibitory effect of adp scales with the concentration of atp ( rief _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) ( and even when the mean stepping rate is reduced two - fold the distribution of dwell periods is unaltered ) .",
    "the growing quantity of information concerning myosin - v has naturally stimulated theoretical discussions of the dynamics .",
    "several models have been proposed and are reviewed by mehta ( 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , in order to provide an explanation of the observed load - dependence of the processivity , the mean dwell time at temperature @xmath10 has been modeled phenomenologically [ following a proposal of wang _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) ] as a sum of two terms , namely @xmath11 corresponding , respectively , to putative force - independent and force dependent transitions .",
    "it is natural to expect here that @xmath12 corresponds to the observed step size @xmath13 nm ( fisher and kolomeisky , 1999 ; fisher and kolomeisky , 2001 ; hille , 2001 ) .",
    "however , fitting the experimental data of mehta _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) , which is displayed in below , necessitates an ( effective ) step size @xmath12 of 10 - 15 nm , which is only 30 - 40 @xmath14 of the actual step size .",
    "this discrepancy is rationalized by asserting that @xmath12 is some `` characteristic distance over which load affects the catalysis rate . ''",
    "furthermore , this approach fails to account clearly for the observed stalling of the motors at @xmath15 pn .",
    "clearly , a more soundly based quantitative theory for processivity of myosin - v seems called for in order to satisfactorily describe the currently available data and to provide testable predictions . the present article aims to meet these requirements .",
    "we present a theoretical analysis of the dynamics of myosin - v using simple , discrete - state stochastic models which have recently been developed and analyzed in detail by kolomeisky and widom ( 1998 ) , fisher and kolomeisky ( 1999a , b ; 2001 ; 2002 ) and kolomeisky and fisher ( 2000a , b ) ; for brevity these articles will be referenced below as * fk01 * , * kf00a * , etc .",
    "this approach has been used successfully in * fk01 * to analyze the extensive experimental data on the dynamics of single conventional kinesin molecules moving _ in vitro _ along microtubules obtained by visscher _",
    "( 1999 ) and schnitzer _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "we will demonstrate that most of the currently available experimental data on the processivity of myosin - v can be well accounted for by the simplest ( @xmath16)-state model embodying a theoretical picture in satisfactory accord with other kinetic and structural experiments .",
    "our treatment also provides specific predictions for as yet unexplored features of myosin - v dynamics that can be tested experimentally and should uncover further details of the stepping mechanism .",
    "for completeness we first outline briefly the class of stochastic models used in our analysis and the _ explicit _ analytical results available for them . in the simplest periodic sequential kinetic model , illustrated schematically in , the protein motor is viewed as moving along a linear periodic track and binding at specific sites located at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) where @xmath19 is a fixed step distance . in a first treatment of myosin - v on actin filaments",
    "we may adopt the observed mean value , @xmath20 nm , corresponding to to the helix repeat distance ( bray , 2001 ) . however , as discussed further below , the analysis can be extended to take account of the variations in the individual step sizes seen in the data for myosin - v ( mehta _ et al . _ , 1999 ; rief _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; walker _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; veigel _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) : the variation seems primarily to result from binding on actin monomers ( at spacing 5.5 nm ) adjacent to the main 6.5-monomer helix repeat distance ( steffen _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "the basic model then supposes that in a catalytic cycle which translocates a motor from binding site @xmath21 to @xmath22 the protein undergoes @xmath23 intermediate biochemical transitions from states @xmath24 to @xmath25 to @xmath26  @xmath27 to @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "kinetic rates @xmath30 and @xmath31 are associated with the transitions from state @xmath32 forwards to state @xmath33 and backwards to state @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath35 represents the motor tightly bound at site @xmath21 in the absence of fuel molecules  atp in the case of myosin - v .",
    "binding of a fuel molecule is represented by the transition @xmath36 , unbinding by @xmath37 .",
    "subsequent hydrolysis and release of products occur in the forward transitions @xmath38 .",
    "but it is important to note that _ backwards _ intermediate transitions _ and _ whole steps ( possibly associated with reverse hydrolysis ) are allowed _ and _ observed experimentally .    for this model the mean velocity , @xmath39 , ( see )",
    "may be expressed exactly in a closed analytic form in terms of the rate constants @xmath40 for any value of @xmath23 ( * fk99 * ) .",
    "furthermore , similar explicit formulae are available for the _ dispersion _ ( or effective diffusion constant ) of the motion , defined by @xmath41.\\ ] ] this measures the statistical deviation of the motor trajectories from uniform motion at constant velocity .",
    "the knowledge of both the velocity @xmath42 _ and _ the dispersion @xmath43 , conveniently combined in terms of _ randomness _ ( svoboda _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) @xmath44 serves to set bounds on @xmath23 via a determination of the number of rate - limiting kinetic biochemical transitions and thus yields valuable information regarding the mechanism of processivity ( visscher _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; * kf00a * ; * fk01 * ; * fk02 * ; koza , 2002 ) .    to account properly for the externally imposed force , @xmath4 , it is essential ( * fk99 * ; * fk01 * ) to introduce _ load distribution factors _ , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 ) .",
    "then the transition rates may be taken to vary as @xmath48 where the most reasonable requirement ( * fk99 * ; * fk01 * ; hille , 2001 ) is @xmath49 which implies that the condition of stall reflects stochastic quasiequilibrium amongst the ( on - pathway ) intermediate mechanochemical states .",
    "indeed , these expressions embody a picture of load - dependent activation barriers for forward and reverse rates between intermediate states @xmath50 that lie on a multidimensional reaction pathway .",
    "the load distribution factors @xmath51 provide significant mechanochemical information since they embody a projection of the valleys and cols ( or passes ) of the reaction pathway onto the force axis , which we suppose is parallel to the motor track .",
    "thus one may identify _ substeps _ of magnitude @xmath52 between motor states @xmath32 and @xmath33 . if the spatial fluctuations of the center of force of the motor in the intermediate states @xmath32 and @xmath33 are sufficiently small relative to @xmath53 one may hope to identify this substep in suitably averaged traces @xmath2 of individual motor motions ( * fk02 * ) .    for the present purpose we note that the explicit expressions for the mean velocity , @xmath42 , for general @xmath23 lead to a simple relation for the stalling force as defined by @xmath54 , namely , @xmath55;\\ ] ] see * fk99*.    the @xmath23-state periodic kinetic model presented in is , mathematically , an example of the general one - dimensional nearest - neighbor random hopping model for which first - passage questions have been much studied : see van kampen ( 1992 ) . of particular interest here are the so - called splitting probabilities and mean first - passage times . specifically , in order to analyze observations of motor - protein _ dwell times _ , we need the `` single - step forward splitting probability , '' @xmath56 , defined as the probability that a motor starting at site @xmath21 will arrive at site @xmath22 _ without _ having undergone sufficiently many intermediate reverse transitions to complete a full backwards step from @xmath21 to site @xmath57 . the corresponding conditional mean single - step first - passage time , @xmath58 , then represents the average time a motor spends at site @xmath21 before leaving and making a _ forward _ step to site @xmath22 . because of the periodic structure of the @xmath23-state model of the ( rather elaborate ) expressions developed by van kampen ( 1992 ) can be simplified considerably even for general @xmath23 ( kolomeisky and fisher , to be published ) .",
    "here we quote the simplest @xmath16 results which will suffice for our present purposes , namely , for the mean forward - step dwell time , @xmath59 while the fraction of backward ( or reverse ) steps is @xmath60    finally we mention that the basic model exhibited in can be extended in various ways while still retaining explicit expressions for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc .",
    "in particular , one may allow for detachments or `` death '' rates , @xmath61 , from the various motor states and for branching ( * kf00a * ) , for parallel site - to - site `` jumping '' ( * kf00a * ) , for parallel biochemical processes ( kolomeisky , 2001 ) , and for waiting time distributions and the associated _ degrees of mechanicity _",
    ", @xmath62 , of the various intermediate processes ( * fk99 * ; * kf00b * ; * fk01 * )",
    ". however , the range of observational data so far obtained for myosin - v ( unlike that known for kinesin ) does not yet warrant consideration of these extensions .",
    "the bulk - solution kinetic data on myosin - v atpase activity indicate that at least two processes , namely , atp binding and adp release , should be taken into account in analyzing the motility ( de la cruz , 1999 ; mehta , 2001 ) . while recognizing that a more complete description may require further intermediate states , it is appropriate , therefore to consider first the simplest ( @xmath16)-state model .",
    "then , as indicated above , the states @xmath63 correspond to a myosin - v molecule bound to the actin filament in the absence of atp  presumably with both heads attached , one behind the other ( walker _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 )  while @xmath64 labels myosin - actin complexes with bound adp .",
    "thus , in the scheme advanced in fig .",
    "6 of mehta ( 2001 ) , the first and last configurations correspond to @xmath63 while the four intermediate states are gathered into @xmath64 ; in fig . 4 of rief _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) the @xmath63 state corresponds to that labelled v ; in fig .",
    "9 of de la cruz _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) the second configuration corresponds to @xmath63 , the remaining three to @xmath64 .",
    "it now follows that the forward atp - binding rate should take the form @xmath65[atp ] , where the superscripts 0 denote the limit of zero load : see . on the other hand , the reverse unbinding rate , @xmath66 , and the forward",
    ", adp release rate , @xmath67 , should be independent of [ atp ] , but , of course , may depend on @xmath4 .    according to standard chemical kinetic arguments ,",
    "the backward rate @xmath68 should , in principle , be proportional to [ adp ] ; and , indeed , the concentration of p@xmath1 should also play a role .",
    "note , particularly , in this connection the high affinity of adp for actomyosin which , as discussed by mehta ( 2001 ) and de la cruz _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) , had led to significant discrepancies in estimates of steady - state cycling rates .",
    "the detailed measurements ( mehta _ et al . _ , 1999 ; rief _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) have , therefore , been performed with the aid of an atp regeneration system [ as previously adopted in the kinesin experiments of visscher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ] .",
    "in such a set - up neither the concentration of adp , nor the that of p@xmath1 , is monitored . while experiments that do control [ adp ] and [ p@xmath1 ] separately are much to be desired , in their absence we are forced ( as in * fk01 * ) to model the atp regeneration scheme more or less phenomenologically . thus if ( a ) we suppose @xmath70}^{\\alpha}$ ] ( which amounts to [ adp ] @xmath71 [ atp]@xmath72 ) , ( b ) recall that the stall force , @xmath73 , is given by , and ( c ) note that the current experimental observations reveal no significant dependence of @xmath73 on [ atp ] ( mehta , 2001 ) , we are led to adopt @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , in light of the use of atp - regeneration in the experiments , the proportionality of [ adp ] , and hence of @xmath68 , to [ atp ] at low concentrations is to be expected : see also * fk01*. it should be remarked , however , that the details of our description of the atp regeneration scheme play only a minor role in fitting the myosin - v processivity data .",
    "now in many previous experimental studies of processive motor proteins the mean velocities , @xmath75 } , f)$ ] , have been measured and reported .",
    "such observations must , at least in principle , include some fraction of backward or reverse steps , especially at large loads approaching stall .",
    "however , in their experiments on myosin - v ( mehta _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; rief _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) the authors opted to measure only dwell times , separating adjacent steps of mean size @xmath13 nm ( mehta , 2001 ) , _ preceding forward steps_. thus their reported dwell times , @xmath76 } , f)$ ] , as plotted in , do _ not _ precisely correspond to an `` overall mean step time , '' say @xmath77 , related to the mean velocity simply via @xmath78  although at low loads , where the fraction of reverse steps is small , @xmath77 should provide a good approximation ; but under near stall conditions , when @xmath79 , the overall mean step time , @xmath77 , diverges to infinity whereas the dwell times @xmath80@xmath81@xmath82 remain bounded .",
    "rather , we identify the observed dwell times with the conditional single - step mean first - passage times , @xmath83 , identified above : see .",
    "accordingly , our analysis of the myosin - v data is based upon the expression @xmath84)= \\frac{k_{0}^{0 } \\mbox{[atp]}e^{-\\theta_{0}^{+ } fd / k_{b}t}+u_{1}^{0}e^{-\\theta_{1}^{+ } fd / k_{b}t } + k_{0}'\\mbox{[atp]}e^{\\theta_{0}^{- } fd / k_{b}t}+w_{1}^{0}e^{\\theta_{1}^{- } fd / k_{b}t}}{k_{0}^{0 } \\mbox{[atp ] } e^{-\\theta_{0}^{+ } fd / k_{b}t }   u_{1}^{0 } e^{-\\theta_{1}^{+ } fd / k_{b}t } + k_{0}'\\mbox{[atp]}e^{\\theta_{0}^{- } fd / k_{b}t } w_{1}^{0}e^{\\theta_{1}^{- } fd / k_{b}t}},\\ ] ] following from eqs . 5 , 6 , and 9 , with @xmath85 nm .",
    "then , by systematically exploring the full seven - dimensional parameter space specified by ( @xmath86 ) we find that the observed stall force , @xmath73 , and the dynamics of myosin - v as a function of [ atp ] and of the load , @xmath4 , up to @xmath73 , are well described by the rates @xmath87 and the load - distribution factors @xmath88 it should be noted that consideration of the limits of low and high [ atp ] and low and high loads , confirm a fair degree of independence of the various fitting parameters .",
    "the uncertainties indicated in eqs .",
    "12 and 13 correspond to the ranges of acceptable fits to the processivity data while constraining the other parameters appropriately .",
    "the central values yield the fits presented in as solid curves .    in respect to our fits for @xmath89 and @xmath90 note that the bulk solution kinetic experiments yield an atp binding rate constant ( corresponding to @xmath89 ) between 0.7 and 1.6 @xmath6m@xmath91s@xmath91 , while the adp - release rate ( corresponding to @xmath90 ) is about 12 - 16 s@xmath91 ( mehta , 2001 ; de la cruz _ et al . _ , 1999 ) .",
    "the agreement is clearly most satisfactory .",
    "the quality of the fits in ensures that the observed ( approximate ) michaelis - menten behavior is respected . indeed , using the rate and load - distribution parameters in eqs .",
    "12 and 13 and previous theory ( e.g. , * fk01 * ) enables us to predict the variation of the mean velocity , @xmath42 , with @xmath4 and [ atp ] : see the solid curves .",
    "evidently , the stall force of about 3 pn seen in the experiments is reproduced .",
    "note also , from the dwell - time data imposed on the predictions in using @xmath92 , that , as anticipated in the discussion before eq .",
    "11 , the approximation @xmath93 is valid for small loads ( up to @xmath94 pn ) . indeed , from eq . 10 ( with eqs . 5 , 6 , 12 , and 13 ) one finds that the fraction of reverse steps is negligible until @xmath95 pn .",
    "it is notable from that within the fitting uncertainties there is essentially _ no _ load - dependence to the binding of atp to the myosin - v - actin complex , i.e. , @xmath96 ; see also mehta ( 2001 ) .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the properties of conventional kinesin moving on a microtubule where @xmath97 was found in * fk01 * for both @xmath16 and @xmath98 fits .",
    "this lack of load - dependence on binding atp to actin - myosin accounts for the fact that the dwell time remains constant at saturating atp conditions up to @xmath99 pn : see fig .",
    "2_a_.    nevertheless the other transitions _ are _ load dependent with adp release bearing a modest ( @xmath100 ) fraction of the dependence .",
    "in parallel to kinesin , however  see * fk01 * , the reverse transitions carry most of the load - dependence .",
    "indeed , the load distribution pattern ( * fk01 * ) for myosin - v is close to a featureless descending ramp .",
    "note that this result is in striking contrast to the implications of the phenomenological expression eq .",
    "1 which suggests that only forward ( i.e. , binding and/or hydrolysis ) processes need be considered and could exhibit significant load - dependence .",
    "indeed , our analysis indicates that at least three biochemical transitions in the actin - myosin - v atpase cycle are load - dependent whereas eq .",
    "1 entails only a single load - dependent process .",
    "it seems that this difference is the main reason why fits for the `` characteristic distance '' @xmath12 in eq .",
    "1 differ so markedly from the true mean step size @xmath20 nm . since our analysis recognizes reverse transitions , which , by the fits , occur at a non - vanishing rate that is enhanced under load [ see , again , eq .",
    "10 ] , an explanation is provided for the observation of more frequent backward steps in myosin - v at high loads ( rief et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "our treatment also provides a basis for a quantitative discussion of the adp inhibition effect which it would be instructive to explore further experimentally .      a striking feature of the data of rief _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) is the observation of `` half steps '' under high loads ( @xmath101 pn ) . from the published",
    "traces the steps appear to correspond to an intermediate state with a mean center of force lying a distance , say @xmath102 forward from the bound - state ( @xmath63 ) center with @xmath103 . on the other hand , and the load distribution factors in indicate a substep with @xmath104 ( corresponding to @xmath105 nm ) .",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) suggest that these `` half steps '' ( always followed by a complementary forward or backward step to complete a movement with @xmath106 or 0 ) reflect an `` off - pathway state '' because they remain rare even under the high loads that uncover their presence .",
    "while this suggestion seems most reasonable on the available evidence , our analysis suggests that the half steps might possibly represent genuine substeps ( lying on or close to the main reaction pathway ) , which appear stochastically under high loads when the forward rates , @xmath107 , have been slowed down while the reverse rates @xmath108 are significantly enhanced .    in other experiments veigel",

    "[ see , e.g. , steffen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . ]    in the absence of such more detailed observations , however , we may test the sensitivity of our fits by further exploratory calculations . as an extreme case ,",
    "suppose 50@xmath14 of the steps are of magnitude @xmath131 nm and 50@xmath14 of size @xmath132 nm . how would the fits change from those assuming a unitary step @xmath121 nm ?",
    "an answer is displayed by the dashed curves plotted in fig .",
    "these have been obtained by using eq .",
    "14 with @xmath133 and computing @xmath134 and @xmath135 from eq .",
    "11 using @xmath129 and @xmath127 together with the _ same _ zero - load rates and load distributions factors given in eqs .",
    "12 and 13 . as evident from fig .",
    "2 , there is no significant change in the quality of the fits  even though it would not be unreasonable to suppose that the rates and load factors might have some dependence on the @xmath136 changes in step - size .",
    "one might say that `` the averages win out ''  a not unexpected conclusion .    in fact we may go further and study the effects of _ correlated step sizes _ by utilizing the expressions for @xmath23-state periodic models ( * kf03 * ) with @xmath23 an integral multiple of @xmath137 , the number of intermediate states in the basic catalytic cycle .",
    "in our analysis we have @xmath138 and so can utilize an @xmath139 periodic system to describe _ alternating long and short steps _ of sizes @xmath129 and @xmath127 ( with , of course , the same previous _",
    "average _ step size @xmath128 ) .",
    "if we again use the zero - load rates and distribution factors in eqs .",
    "12 and 13 , and compute the mean velocity as a function of load , we obtain the dashed curves presented in fig .",
    "once more the deviations from the @xmath140 results are negligible at loads @xmath141 pn , while at higher loads sufficiently precise data might reveal discrepancies .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the consequences of replacing a distribution of step sizes by the mean @xmath120 are not significant at current levels of experimental precision .",
    "conversely , unless fairly precise experimental data can be obtained that are categorized by step length , there may be little more that can be reliably determined by fitting such observations .",
    "as mentioned previously , the fluctuation statistics of motor motion are effectively captured in the randomness parameter , @xmath142 , as defined in .",
    "the fits presented in and 13 suffice to predict the variation of @xmath142 with [ atp ] under various loads ( or vice versa ) _ assuming _ that all the rate processes may be adequately represented as standard kinetic transitions : see * fk99 * and * kf00*. the corresponding predictions for @xmath143})$ ] are presented in for loads @xmath144 and 2.5 pn . at low [ atp ]",
    "the randomness is close to unity indicating that only one rate - limiting process is effective in this concentration range .",
    "however , under a low load a marked dip to @xmath145 occurs around @xmath146}=10 - 20 \\ \\mu$]m : this , in turn , is indicative of two competing rate processes that both play a role in this `` crossover '' regime . on the other hand , at high loads that approach stall",
    ", @xmath142 rises rapidly above unity ; however , this is primarily a consequence of the vanishing of the velocity @xmath42 when @xmath147 since @xmath142 must then diverge : see also fig .",
    "5(b ) , below .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the analogous predictions , on the basis of an ( @xmath16)-state kinetic model , for the the randomness of kinesin are _ not _ supported by the data of visscher _ et al . _",
    "rather , for low loads and @xmath148 } \\gtrsim 30 \\ \\mu$]m , the randomness falls rapidly and _ remains below _ 0.5 up to saturation concentrations : because of the bound @xmath149 ( * fk99 * , koza , 2002 ) , this is inconsistent with a kinetic description .",
    "thus the data for conventional kinesin demand @xmath98 ( or more ) states ( in accord with the usual biochemical picture of atp hydrolysis ) .",
    "_ alternatively _ , and , in light of certain experiments ( nishiyama _ et al_. , 2001 ) , possibly more realistically , one may invoke a waiting - time distribution to describe the process of hydrolysis and adp release with a _",
    "mechanicity _ @xmath150 ( * kf00 * , * fk01 * )",
    ". thus measurements of @xmath151})$ ] for myosin - v might well prove equally revealing of the mechanism by _ failing _ to verify the behavior predicted by !      another interesting and potentially instructive set of predictions",
    "can be advanced for the behavior under _ negative _ or _ assisting _ loads , @xmath152 .",
    "such experiments have been performed for kinesin by coppin et al .",
    "although their data posed certain problems ( in particular , a significantly lower overall processivity under low loads ) the same load distribution factors ( and similar rates ) provided a not unreasonable ( @xmath16 ) fit ( * fk01 * ) simply by extending the analog of to negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding predictions for the dwell time and for the randomness as a function of @xmath4 , extending down to @xmath153 pn , are displayed in .",
    "a caveat must , however , again be raised in light of subsequent experiments on kinesin by block ( 2001 ) and coworkers .",
    "the validity of the extension of to negative @xmath4 clearly rests on a mechanistic / geometric assumption , namely , that changing abruptly the direction at which the coiled - coil myosin tail leaves the junction with two heads ( or motor domains ) , i.e. , from trailing upwards and backward ( @xmath154 ) to pulling upwards and forward ( @xmath152 ) does not result in a corresponding abrupt change in the mechanics of atp binding , unbinding , or hydrolysis . if the junction were a perfect universal swivel joint , then as @xmath4 , which is just the _ component _ of the total load force , say @xmath155 , parallel to the track , passes through zero the stresses and strains within motor should , indeed , vary smoothly . however , the junction can not be totally torsion free and if , for example , the tail were to rest against part of the head in one configuration but become dissociated in the other , then the smoothness assumption embodied in would fail .",
    "indeed , just such an abrupt change of behavior has since been found by block and coworkers ( 2001 ) for kinesin . clearly , comparable experiments on myosin - v are desirable and should prove informative .",
    "in summary , we have presented a simple two - state stochastic model , with allowance for fluctuating step sizes , which describes well essentially all the available experimental data on single - molecule myosin - v processivity .",
    "it reveals that atp binding is load - independent , while adp release is weakly load - dependent ; but ( as for kinesin ) the loading forces strongly affect the reverse transition rates . our analysis is consistent with the observation of tight coupling between catalytic cycles and mechanical steps , i.e. , one atp molecule is consumed per individual step , and with atp binding and adp release rates measured in bulk solution .",
    "it also indicates that an intermediate myosin - adp - actin complex has its center of force advanced by 13 - 14 nm forward from the position prior to atp binding , in reasonable agreement with various observations indicating a subsequent `` working stroke '' of around 22 nm .",
    "we have discussed specific predictions for the dwell times , mean velocity , and randomness of myosin - v motors in various experimental regimes including the imposition of assisting loads .",
    "further experiments are needed in order to investigate the validity of our theoretical description and to uncover other mechanochemical features of myosin - v .",
