    "<S> however , it does result in a significant renormalization of the predicted binding energy @xmath52 associated with the self - assembly . </S>",
    "<S> aggeli et al describe their small volume as characterising the movement of monomers within a tape and thus might be regarded as a rough correction for the entropy cost associated with forming a linear aggregate in a 3d solution , in contrast to a 1d model . </S>",
    "<S> + by breaking the isodesmic symmetry with a non - zero value of @xmath49 the self - assembly of dimers is suppressed to higher concentrations , after which the rest of the cluster distribution kicks in . this induces a sigmoidal shape to @xmath48 just before the percentage of beta - sheet self - assembly reaches 50% : @xmath53 there is no discontinuous jump in the order parameter @xmath54 ( no van der waals ` loop ' in @xmath55 ) , since as already discussed there is no region of two - phase coexistence for these short - range 1d models . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is reminiscent of micelle formation ; since the ` micelles ' are tapes , the concentration at which this rapid increase in linear aggregation takes place can be denoted a ` ctc ' . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of some interest that we have identified a class of exactly solvable 1d models that display the phenomenon of a ctc . </S>",
    "<S> these broken isodesmic lg models are defined explicitly by the hamiltonian @xmath56 a non - zero value of @xmath49 is therefore mathematically equivalent to the introduction of a three - body interaction .    </S>",
