    "the subject of gravitational fields generated by sources which move at the speed of light has been extensively studied in the literature because of its close connection to the topic of gravitational waves , whose direct detection remains extremely difficult , since one normally deals with a very weak signal .",
    "the first who dealt with this aspect of general relativity was tolman in 1934 @xcite , who studied the gravitational field of light beams and pulses in the linearized theory .",
    "but it was only in 1971 that aichelburg and sexl @xcite developed a method to describe the gravitational field associated to a massless point particle moving at the speed of light in minkowski spacetime ( i.e. the gravitational field from a single photon ) .",
    "in fact in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors first derive this field by solving the linearized einstein field equations for a particle with rest mass @xmath2 moving uniformly with velocity @xmath3 .",
    "then they take the limit @xmath4 while the mass of the particle tends to zero in such a way that its energy remains finite . after that",
    ", they start with the full einstein theory and the schwarzschild metric ( the exact metric describing a particle at rest ) , which written in isotropic coordinates reads as @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "afterwards they apply to this metric a lorentz transformation @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 to obtain the gravitational field as seen by an observer moving uniformly with velocity @xmath3 relative to the mass",
    ". once the limits @xmath4 and @xmath12 are taken , aichelburg and sexl obtain the remarkable result that both the linearized solution and the exact solution agree completely",
    ".    the method first developed by aichelburg and sexl is called in the literature `` the boost of a metric '' . with this procedure",
    "it is possible to show that the gravitational field of a null source is nonvanishing on a plane containing the particle and orthogonal to the direction of motion , i.e. ( asymmetric ) plane - fronted gravitational waves .",
    "the riemann curvature tensor is zero everywhere except on this plane , where it assumes a distributional nature .",
    "the intriguing fact is that the boosted metric in the ultrarelativistic regime ( @xmath4 ) has a new type of singularity , i.e. a distributional ( dirac - delta - like ) singularity .",
    "the boosted ultrarelativistic metric obtained in ref . @xcite reads indeed as @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the gravitational field turns out to travel with the particle , being zero everywhere except at the hypersurface @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , as anticipated before , the riemann tensor of ( [ asmetric ] ) is zero everywhere except on the hypersurface @xmath15 and has nonvanishing components given by @xcite @xmath16 , \\label{asriemann1}\\ ] ] @xmath17,\\ ] ] @xmath18 with the other components related to the ones given above by symmetry .",
    "an important remark should be made at this point , since the riemann tensor is perfectly defined as it contains the tensor product of dirac s @xmath0 distributions ( and not their multiplications ) .",
    "the only elements which are `` poorly defined '' in ( [ asriemann1])([asriemann2 ] ) are represented by the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are not locally integrable on the @xmath21-plane and , therefore , do not define , a priori , any distribution . of course",
    ", their `` regularization '' ( a la gelfand , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) is straightforward : the integration is understood in such a way that we first integrate over the set @xmath22 and then pass to the limit @xmath23 .    in order to give a precise meaning to expressions ( [ asriemann1])([asriemann2 ] ) , instead of transforming the schwarzschild metric ( [ isotropic_schwarzchild ] ) , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have applied the lorentz transformations ( [ aslorentztransformation1])([aslorentztransformation2 ] ) directly to the components of the riemann tensor and then they have investigated the regime @xmath4 . in this way , with the help of tetrad formalism , aichelburg and sexl have obtained relations which are valid only for those spacetime points where @xmath24 . in particular , they obtain again the relations ( [ asriemann1])([asriemann2 ] ) , but without the functions @xmath25 which vanish because of the condition @xmath24 .",
    "this fact shows that on the hypersurface @xmath26 the riemann tensor has a @xmath0-like singularity and is exactly of petrov type @xmath27 ( i.e. all four principal null directions of the weyl spinor , describing the weyl conformal curvature , coincide ) .",
    "years after the work by aichelburg and sexl , more general impulsive waves were obtained by boosting other black hole spacetimes with rotation , charge and a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the technique of boosting a spacetime metric in fact has a lot of applications in theoretical physics .",
    "the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , shows that the black hole formation caused by the collision of two particles with large relative velocity ( @xmath4 ) , and considered in the rest frame of one of the particles , involves the concept of boosted metric : the gravitational field of the other particle is described by the ultrarelativistic boosted schwarschild - de sitter metric .",
    "moreover , the collisions of shock - waves and heavy ions as well as the entropy that is consequently produced @xcite appeal to the boost procedure , also in the context of higher dimensions @xcite and branes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to study the formation of marginally trapped surfaces in the head - on collision both of two shock - waves @xcite and of two ultrarelativistic charged particles @xcite in de sitter space by using the procedure of boosting a metric , since for example in the latter case the metric of the two charges is obtained by boosting reissner - nordstrm - de sitter spacetime to the speed of light , while with similar arguments it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the collision of two reissner - nordstrm gravitational shock - waves in anti - de sitter space prevents the formation of marginally trapped surfaces of penrose type . finally , the concept of a boosted metric can be used as a tool to describe ( de sitter ) spacetime from a quantum point of view @xcite .    our main attention here will be devoted to the work in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite where it has been shown in detail how to map , through a boosting procedure , the schwarzschild - de sitter metric @xmath28 into the highly singular form ) see appendix [ tetrad ] . ]",
    "( with @xmath4 ) @xmath29 \\delta(y_{0}+y_{1})({\\rm d}y_{0}+{\\rm d}y_{1})^{2 } , \\label{ultrarelativistic boosted metric } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the first line describes de sitter space viewed as a four - dimensional hyperboloid of radius @xmath30 having equation @xmath31 embedded into flat five - dimensional space , while the second line of ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) describes a shock - wave singularity located on the null hypersurface having equations @xmath32 @xmath33 equation ( [ null hypersurface 2 ] ) being obtained by the joint effect of the hyperboloid constraint ( [ hyperboloid constrain ] ) and the dirac - delta condition ( [ null hypersurface 1 ] ) . since the metric is turned into a mathematical object having distributional nature , the usual spacetime picture is no longer valid , but it would be very interesting to evaluate the effect of these shock - wave singularities on curvature .",
    "the great revolution introduced by einstein s theory consists in fact in viewing the gravitational field as the curvature of spacetime .",
    "such a curvature is directly coupled to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present , as specified by the einstein field equations whose content states that `` the matter and the energy say to the spacetime how to curve , and the curvature of spacetime says to the matter how to move '' @xcite .",
    "thus , one of the most important objects of the theory of the gravitational field is the riemann tensor , since it is an intrinsic object that catches in an elegant and covariant way the features of spacetime curvature .",
    "therefore it could be of great physical importance to evaluate the riemann tensor for this type of geometries , i.e. `` the boosted geometries '' .",
    "( to fully appreciate the importance of this tensor see appendix [ appendix riemann ] ) .",
    "since `` gravitation is a manifestation of spacetime curvature , and curvature shows up in the deviation of one geodesic from a nearby geodesic '' @xcite , the concept of spacetime curvature is directly related to the geodesic completeness of spacetime , as we say that a spacetime manifold is geodesically complete if any geodesic can be extended to arbitrary values of the affine parameter .",
    "thus , knowledge of the riemann curvature tensor is an essential step towards the description of topological features of spacetime and this motivates the effort we made in calculating the riemann tensor for the boosted schwarschild - de sitter metric .",
    "we stress that the definitions ( [ definition riemann])([geodesic deviation ] ) are given in terms of objects that , unlike the ones we will handle , have no distributional singularities ( cfr ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) ) .",
    "thus , in this article we are interested in a sort of generalization of the usual concept of riemann tensor , which enlarges the notion of curvature , i.e. what we call the `` boosted riemann tensor '' , with a particular interest in the ultrarelativistic regime , where distributional singularities show up . by virtue of the high difficulty of dealing with the metric ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] )",
    ", we decided to start from its low - velocity limit and then to reach the ultrarelativistic regime via numerical calculations .",
    "for this purpose , sec .",
    "ii evaluates the procedure to obtain the boosted schwarzschild - de sitter metric in manifestly four - dimensional form .",
    "then , it is shown that the basis defined by the boost procedure is a coordinate basis , a property that greatly simplifies the calculations performed . in sec .",
    "iii the analysis of both the kretschmann invariant and the geodesic equation allows us to characterize the features of curvature .",
    "an important question arises while dealing with secs .",
    "ii - iii , i.e. how to deal with the riemann curvature tensor when it has terms proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "in fact from ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) it is easy to understand that the riemann tensor has got terms involving the products of two dirac s @xmath0 distributions ( a formal method to cope with multiplication of distributions can be found in ref .",
    "this means that the `` boosted riemann tensor '' of the `` boosted geometry '' we are going to describe is in principle not defined .",
    "anyway , we will be able to show that the @xmath1 terms appearing in the `` boosted riemann tensor '' vanish in a distributional sense . unlike the ( rather simple ) example discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will achieve this point in a more difficult way , since the high difficulty of metric ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) makes it quite impossible to write down explicitly all the boosted riemann tensor components , as anticipated above .",
    "for this reason in sec .",
    "iv we will make use of an equivalent method to describe the gravitational shock - wave of a massless particle , i.e. the coordinate shift method @xcite ( or the scissors - and - paste method by penrose @xcite ) .",
    "the equivalence of this method and the boosting procedure has been demonstrated by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is explicitly shown that with the new approach it is possible to recover the results of aichelburg and sexl . by exploiting this equivalence between the two methods",
    ", we will be able to show in which sense the @xmath1 terms appearing in the riemann tensor of metric ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) can be seen as vanishing , leading to a well defined spacetime function ( in the sense of distributions ) .",
    "concluding remarks and open problems are presented in sec . v.",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite we can express a de sitter spacetime in four dimensions as a four - dimensional hyperboloid of radius @xmath30 embedded in five - dimensional minkowski spacetime having metric @xmath34 with coordinates satisfying the hyperboloid constraint @xmath35 by exploiting the relations between the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) coordinates and the spherical static coordinates @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 and on defining @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 we can express the schwarschild - de sitter metric ( [ s - ds metric ] ) in the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 at this stage , we introduce a lorentz boost in the @xmath51-direction by defining a new set of coordinates independent of @xmath3 , i.e. the @xmath52 coordinates , such that ( hereafter @xmath53 ) @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 thus , starting from ( [ z s - ds metric ] ) jointly with ( [ boost 1])([boost 2 ] ) we eventually obtain the boosted schwarzschild - de sitter metric @xmath57 whose singular ultrarelativistic limit is expressed by ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) .",
    "thus , we can interpret ( [ boosted metric ] ) as the low - velocity limit of ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) .",
    "the spacetime metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) is apparently expressed by a @xmath58 matrix while the original metric ( [ s - ds metric ] ) is expressed through @xmath59 local coordinates @xmath60 .",
    "hence also the metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) should be eventually expressed through @xmath59 coordinates only , if one wants to arrive at a formula for the curvature , since our reference spacetime remains four - dimensional . to restore the usual four - dimensional form of the metric , we have to exploit the constraint ( [ z hyperboloid constraint ] ) expressed in terms of @xmath52 coordinates , i.e. eq . ( [ hyperboloid constrain ] ) .",
    "by virtue of this condition we can write @xmath61 @xmath62 and eventually , using ( [ y0 ] ) and ( [ dyo ] ) , we obtain the manifestly four - dimensional form of the boosted metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) , which can be expressed by the relations @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 having obtained the formulas ( [ g11])([g34 ] ) , we can evaluate the riemann - christoffel symbols and consequently the riemann curvature tensor of the boosted schwarzschild - de sitter metric by using the familiar relations of classical general relativity .",
    "the most general form of riemann - christoffel symbols reads as follows @xcite ( @xmath73 being abstract indices ) : @xmath74 where the `` commutation coefficients '' @xmath75 are defined by @xmath76 \\equiv c_{bc}^{\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; a } \\ ; \\bold{e}_{a } ,   \\label{c_abc}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 being any noncoordinate basis .",
    "last , the components of the riemann tensor are given by @xmath78 we can somewhat simplify the relations ( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ riemann tensor ] ) in the case in which @xmath79 ( @xmath80 being a coordinate index such that @xmath81 ) is a coordinate basis .",
    "as we know , the static spherical basis @xmath38 is indeed a coordinate basis .",
    "bearing in mind definitions ( [ z0])([z3 ] ) , the jacobian of the transformation between the spherical coordinates and the @xmath82 is expressed by @xmath83 while the inverse jacobian reads as @xmath84 by virtue of ( [ jacobian ] ) and ( [ inverse jacobian ] ) , if we adopt the concise notation @xmath85 we can write @xmath86 and , by exploiting the fact that @xmath87 is a coordinate basis , after a lengthy calculation we arrive at the conclusion that also the basis @xmath82 is a coordinate basis , or in other words we have that @xmath88=0 .\\ ] ] the relations ( [ boost 1])([boost 2 ] ) for the boost show that the transformations between @xmath89 and @xmath90 are linear , therefore we can easily conclude that @xmath91=0 , \\ ] ] hence the basis @xmath92 is a coordinate basis as well .",
    "this means that we can evaluate the riemann - christoffel symbols and the riemann curvature tensor for the boosted spacetime metric ( [ g11])([g34 ] ) by setting @xmath93 in the relations ( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ riemann tensor ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , these relations are still too complicated to be computed analytically , and therefore a numerical calculation has been necessary",
    ". formulas ( [ g11])([g34 ] ) show indeed that we are dealing with a spacetime metric represented by a @xmath94 matrix whose elements are given by some complicated nonvanishing functions of the @xmath95 coordinates .",
    "that is why we first tried to compute the riemann curvature tensor analytically in terms of tetrads ( see appendix [ tetrad ] ) before realizing that even this solution was far too complicated .",
    "thus , the only way we had to compute the riemann - christoffel symbols and the riemann tensor was represented by numerical calculations . in this way we can evaluate the behavior of spacetime curvature also in the ultra - relativistic regime , which is the one we are mainly interested in , by letting the velocity defined by the boost relations ( [ boost 1])([boost 2 ] ) approach gradually the speed of light .",
    "in what follows we discuss the results of our computation mainly by studying curvature invariants and the behavior of geodesics in our reference spacetime .",
    "we in fact think that these features represent the best tools to describe physically the concept of spacetime curvature .",
    "intuitively , a spacetime singularity is a `` place '' where the curvature `` blows up '' @xcite or , by analogy with electrodynamics , a point where the metric tensor is either not defined or not suitably differentiable @xcite .",
    "regrettably , both these statements are not rigorous definitions that can characterize the concept of singularity .",
    "first of all , since in general relativity we do not know the manifold and the metric structure in advance ( they are solutions of einstein field equations ) , we are not able to give a physical sense to the notion of an event until we solve einstein equations , and hence the idea of a singularity as a `` place '' has not a satisfactory meaning . moreover , also",
    "the notion of curvature becoming larger and larger as a general criterion for singularities has pathological problems .",
    "in fact , the bad behavior of components or derivatives of the riemann tensor could be ascribed to the coordinate or tetrad basis used . to avoid this problem",
    ", one might examine scalar curvature invariants constructed from the riemann tensor or its covariant derivatives , which in some cases can completely characterize the spacetime ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "however , even if the value of some scalar invariants is unbounded , curvature might blow up only `` as one goes to infinity '' , a case that we would interpret as a singularity - free spacetime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spacetimes may be singular without any bad behavior of the curvature tensor ( the so - called `` conical singularities '' @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , the bad behavior of the metric tensor at some spacetime points can not be a way to define singularities , as one could always cut out such points and hence the remaining manifold , representing the whole spacetime , would turn out to be nonsingular .",
    "a more satisfactory idea to define singularities is to use the notion of incompleteness of timelike geodesics , i.e. geodesics which are inextendible in at least one direction and hence have only a finite range of affine parameter .",
    "this has the immediate physical interpretation that there exist freely moving observers or particles whose histories did not exist after ( or before ) a finite interval of proper time .",
    "although the physical meaning of affine parameter on null geodesics is different from the case of timelike geodesics , we could also regard null geodesic incompleteness as a good criterion to define spacetime singularities .",
    "thus , timelike and null geodesic completeness are minimum conditions for spacetime to be considered singularity - free @xcite . however , as there are examples of geodesically complete spacetimes which contain an inextendible timelike curve of bounded acceleration and finite length @xcite , we should generalize the concept of affine parameter to all @xmath96 curves , no matter whether they are geodesics or not . this fact is linked to the concept of b - completeness ( short for bundle completeness ) , which we shortly describe following refs .",
    "@xcite in appendix [ b - completeness ] .",
    "therefore , we can classify a singularity represented by the presence of at least one incomplete geodesic according to whether @xcite    1 .",
    "a curvature invariant blows up along a geodesic ( `` scalar curvature singularity '' ) , 2 .   a component of the riemann tensor or its covariant derivatives in a parallelly propagated tetrad blows up along a geodesic ( `` parallelly propagated curvature singularity '' ) , 3 .",
    "no such invariant or component blows up ( `` noncurvature singularity '' ) .",
    "we can therefore understand the importance of scalar curvature invariants in the analysis of spacetime singularities .",
    "being coordinate independent , curvature invariants can describe the size of curvature and its growth along timelike curves , and can also characterize curvature singularities @xcite , while providing important information about the nature of singularities .",
    "for example , in the case of schwarzschild metric , which can be obtained from ( [ s - ds metric ] ) if we put @xmath97 ( for an unambiguous definition of the notion of limit applied to spacetimes see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the kretschmann invariant ( i.e. the riemann tensor squared ) is such that @xmath98 in agreement with the fact that in all coordinate systems the real singularity is located only at @xmath99 and not also at @xmath100 ( i.e. the event horizon ) .    in order to study the features of the riemann curvature of spacetime described by the metric ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] )",
    ", we therefore decided to plot the kretschmann invariant at different values of boost velocity @xmath3 and study the geodesic equation @xmath101 @xmath102 being the affine parameter of the geodesic having parametric equation @xmath103 .",
    "from the analysis of the kretschmann invariant we found that it is not defined unless the inequality ( hereafter , numerical values of @xmath104 coordinates have downstairs indices , to be consistent with the notation in sec .",
    "ii ) @xmath105 is satisfied .",
    "hence , we see that the hyperboloid constraint , condition ( [ hyperboloid constrain ] ) , allows us to define a 3-sphere of radius @xmath30 where the kretschmann invariant is not defined",
    ". this peculiar feature of our `` boosted spacetime geometry '' is indeed obvious if we look at formulas ( [ g11])([g34 ] ) , as here the quantities @xmath106 and @xmath107 always appear at the denominator of the expressions of the metric tensor @xmath108 , which means that the metric is defined only if the inequality ( [ singularity kretschmann ] ) holds .",
    "moreover , it is possible to derive eq .",
    "( [ singularity kretschmann ] ) in the regime @xmath109 from the analysis of the kretschmann invariant for the schwarzschild - de sitter metric ( [ s - ds metric ] ) .",
    "in fact for ( [ s - ds metric ] ) the kretschmann invariant reads as @xmath110 which reduces to ( [ schwarzschild kretsch ] ) in the limit @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , it follows immediately from ( [ s - ds kretsch ] ) that the schwarzschild - de sitter metric ( [ s - ds metric ] ) has an unique singularity located at @xmath99 .",
    "equation ( [ r^2_1 ] ) clearly shows that the condition @xmath99 leads to @xmath111 which , being defined by the sum of squared quantities , in turns implies that @xmath112 thus , because of the presence of the term @xmath107 , the condition @xmath99 is equivalent to ( [ r=0 in terms of y ] ) , provided that @xmath113 .",
    "if we now bear in mind that ( [ g11])([g34 ] ) prevent @xmath106 from vanishing , we can conclude that the only possible choice is @xmath114 , which is equivalent to ( [ singularity kretschmann ] ) .",
    "in other words , the presence of the 3-sphere where the kretschmann invariant is not defined follows directly from the condition @xmath99 which makes the curvature invariant ( [ s - ds kretsch ] ) diverge .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as a hint indicating that this 3-sphere could represent a singularity of our `` boosted geometry '' .",
    "eventually , if we interpret @xmath115 as the time coordinate ( see ( [ boost 1 ] ) ) , we can view ( [ singularity kretschmann ] ) as a condition on time .    in the @xmath116 plane",
    "this 3-sphere becomes the circle with center at @xmath117 and radius @xmath30 of fig .",

    "the `` boosted horizon '' is not a singularity but , as we will show , it seems to be a sort of elastic wall which is hit by all particles before they get away . we have observed this effect numerically , by varying initial conditions of ( [ geodesic eq ] ) and the boost velocity @xmath3 , so as to reproduce different physical situations .",

    "we have shown that this new picture is equivalent to the boosting procedure and we have demonstrated how it solves the problem of the presence of @xmath1 terms in the riemann tensor . in particular , the `` antigravity effects '' emerged at the `` boosted horizon '' have been ascribed to the refraction phenomenon described by the function ( [ refraction_function ] ) . moreover , the fact that in the ultrarelativistic regime the `` boosted horizon '' position s tends to that of the singularity 3-sphere could be related to the fact that , in the coordinate shift method picture , when the particle crosses the null surface located at @xmath168 it suffers a discontinuity in its @xmath3-component ( eq . ( [ v_discontinuity ] ) ) while the @xmath198 components are refracted according to ( [ refraction_function ] ) .",

    "since our paper is addressed to a wide physics audience , we recall here some basic properties of pseudo - riemannian geometry .",
    "the riemann tensor can be defined in various alternative ( and equivalent ) ways @xcite , @xcite .",
    "first , it can be defined as the map @xmath290 ( @xmath291 being the set of all vector fields defined on the manifold @xmath292 ) such that @xmath293}z . \\label{definition riemann}\\ ] ] in the case in which @xmath294=0 $ ] , the previous formula reduces to @xmath295 therefore , we can say that the riemann tensor measures the failure of successive operations of differentiation to commute when applied to a dual vector field ( which can be interpreted as the integrability obstruction for the existence of an isometry with euclidean space ) , that is ( in abstract index notation ) @xmath296 moreover , we can say that the failure of a vector to return to its original value when parallel transported around a small closed loop is directly connected to the riemann tensor , which is in this way related to the path dependence of parallel transport .",
    "we can easily construct a small closed loop at @xmath297 by choosing a two - dimensional surface @xmath298 through @xmath184 and choosing coordinates @xmath299 and @xmath102 in the surface .",
    "next we construct the loop by moving of a quantity @xmath300 along the @xmath301 curve , followed by moving @xmath302 along the @xmath303 curve and then we revert by @xmath300 and @xmath302 .",
    "if we consider the vector @xmath304 at @xmath184 and parallel trasport it around the closed loop we have just constructed , the change @xmath305 to second order in the displacement @xmath300 ,",
    "@xmath302 that we register when we revert to the starting point involves once again the riemann tensor , because we have @xmath306 where @xmath307 , @xmath308 indicate the tangent to the curves of constant @xmath102 and @xmath299 , respectively .",
    "finally , the riemann tensor appears also in the geodesic deviation equation , the equation which measures the tendency of geodesics to accelerate toward or away from each other . if @xmath309 denotes a smooth @xmath310-parameter family of geodesics such that for each @xmath311 the curve @xmath312 is a geodesic with affine parameter @xmath299 , the geodesic deviation equation reads as @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the relative acceleration of an infinitesimally nearby geodesic in the family , @xmath315 is the deviation vector ( @xmath316 being the coordinates of one geodesic of the family @xmath309 ) and @xmath317 represents the vector tangent to the geodesic .",
    "therefore the equation ( [ geodesic deviation ] ) states that , if the curvature does not vanish , some initially parallel geodesics will fail to remain parallel : in the presence of a gravitational field the fifth postulate of euclidean geometry is no longer valid .",
    "in most situations a curvature calculation that relies upon christoffel symbols is extremely lengthy and not obviously feasible or readable .",
    "however , the tetrad formalism is known to simplify such a task , at least when the metric does not possess distributional singularities .",
    "thus , this appendix is devoted to some effort we made to express the highly singular ultrarelativistic boosted metric ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) in terms of tetrads .    as in the case of the boosted metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) , starting from the ultrarelativistic metric ( [ ultrarelativistic boosted metric ] ) we can arrive at its manifestly four - dimensional form by exploiting ( [ y0 ] ) and ( [ dyo ] ) and hence we can eventually write the covariant metric components in the concise form @xmath318 @xmath319 @xmath320 @xmath321 where @xmath322 . \\label{f(y4)}\\ ] ] since all components of this metric are nonvanishing , at this stage we still assume the existence of tetrad covectors @xmath323 such that the covariant form of the metric reads as @xmath324 @xmath325 being lorentz - frame indices , and @xmath326 being the familiar minkowski metric @xmath327 . by comparison of the formulae ( [ gkk ultrarelativ])([g34 ultrarelativ ] ) with ( [ metric tetrad ] ) we find that one can set @xmath328 while the other components of the singular , distribution - valued limit of tetrad covectors solve the following nonlinear algebraic system : @xmath329 @xmath330 @xmath331 @xmath332 since the system ( [ alg tetrad 1])([alg tetrad 4 ] ) consists of @xmath333 equations for the @xmath334 unknown tetrad covectors , it is possible to find at least a particular solution . now , once we get such a solution , the procedure should be as follows . as we know from general relativity , whenever the spacetime manifold is parallelizable",

    "<S> the ultrarelativistic boosting procedure had been applied in the literature to map the metric of schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime into a metric describing de sitter spacetime plus a shock - wave singularity located on a null hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> this paper evaluates the riemann curvature tensor of the boosted schwarzschild - de sitter metric by means of numerical calculations , which make it possible to reach the ultrarelativistic regime gradually by letting the boost velocity approach the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the first time in the literature , the singular limit of curvature , through dirac s @xmath0 distribution and its derivatives , is numerically evaluated for this class of spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the analysis of the kretschmann invariant and the geodesic equation shows that the spacetime possesses a `` scalar curvature singularity '' within a 3-sphere and it is possible to define what we here call `` boosted horizon '' , a sort of elastic wall where all particles are surprisingly pushed away , as numerical analysis demonstrates . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to suggest that such `` boosted geometries '' are ruled by a sort of `` antigravity effect '' since all geodesics seem to refuse to enter the `` boosted horizon '' and are `` reflected '' by it , even though their initial conditions are aimed at driving the particles towards the `` boosted horizon '' itself . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the equivalence with the coordinate shift method is invoked in order to demonstrate that all @xmath1 terms appearing in the riemann curvature tensor give vanishing contribution in distributional sense . </S>"
