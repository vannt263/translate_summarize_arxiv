    "<S> we report results on the decay @xmath0 and its charge conjugate using a data sample of 85.4 million @xmath1 pairs recorded at the @xmath2 resonance with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric @xmath3 storage ring </S>",
    "<S> . ratios of branching fractions of cabibbo - suppressed to cabibbo - favored processes are determined to be @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 where the indices 1 and 2 represent the cp=+1 and cp=@xmath71 eigenstates of the @xmath8 system , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find the partial - rate charge asymmetries for @xmath0 to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the extraction of @xmath11  @xcite , an angle of the kobayashi - maskawa triangle  @xcite , is a challenging measurement even with modern high luminosity @xmath12 factories . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical work on @xmath12 meson dynamics has demonstrated the direct accessibility of @xmath11 using the process @xmath13  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . if the @xmath14 is reconstructed as a cp eigenstate , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 processes interfere . </S>",
    "<S> this interference leads to direct cp violation as well as a characteristic pattern of branching fractions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the branching fractions for @xmath17 meson decay modes to cp eigenstates are only of order 1  % . since cp violation through interference </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be small , a large number of @xmath12 decays is needed to extract @xmath18 . assuming the absence of @xmath19 mixing , the observables sensitive to cp violation that are used to extract the angle @xmath18  @xcite are , @xmath20 where the ratios @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined as @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 and @xmath26 are cp - even and cp - odd eigenstates of the neutral @xmath17 meson , @xmath27 is the ratio of the amplitudes of the two tree diagrams shown in fig .  1 and @xmath28 is their strong - phase difference </S>",
    "<S> . the ratio @xmath29 corresponds to the magnitude of cp asymmetry and is suppressed to the level of @xmath30 due to the ckm factor  @xmath31 and a color suppression factor  @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the asymmetries @xmath33 and @xmath34 have opposite signs .    </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the cabibbo - suppressed decay @xmath35 to the cabibbo - favored decay @xmath36 has been reported by cleo  @xcite to be @xmath37 while belle finds @xmath38  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming factorization , the ratio @xmath22 is expected to be @xmath39 in the tree - level approximation , where @xmath40 is the cabibbo angle , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are meson decay constants . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are in good agreement with this theoretical expectation .    previously , belle reported the observation of the decays @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45  @xcite . this paper reports more precise measurements of these decays with a data sample of @xmath46 , containing 85.4 million @xmath1 pairs , collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath47 ( 3.5 on 8  gev ) collider operating at the @xmath2 resonance . at kekb , the @xmath2 </S>",

    "<S> the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a three - layer silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of silica aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a super - conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath49 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the charged track , @xmath59 and @xmath60 selection requirements have been described in ref .  @xcite . for each charged track , information from the acc , tof and specific ionization measurements from the cdc are used to determine a @xmath61 likelihood ratio @xmath62 = @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are kaon and pion likelihoods . for kaons ( pions ) from the @xmath66 mode we used the particle identification requirement of @xmath67 . for kaons from the @xmath68 mode </S>",

    "<S> , we require the @xmath79 invariant mass to be greater than @xmath80 from the @xmath81 nominal mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath82 mesons are reconstructed from two oppositely charged kaons in the mass window of @xmath83 with @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply the @xmath82 helicity angle cut @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the angle between one of the @xmath82 daughters in the @xmath82 rest frame and the @xmath82 momentum in the @xmath14 rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> we form candidate @xmath85 and @xmath86 mesons using the @xmath87 and @xmath88 decay modes with mass ranges of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> both @xmath85 and @xmath86 candidates are kinematically constrained to their nominal masses . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 candidates are required to have masses within @xmath922.5@xmath93 of their nominal masses , where @xmath93 is the measured mass resolution which ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 depending on the decay channel . a @xmath14 mass and ( wherever possible)vertex constrained fit is then performed on the remaining candidates .    </S>",
    "<S> we combine the @xmath14 and @xmath96/@xmath97 candidates ( denoted by @xmath98 ) to form @xmath12 candidates . we apply tighter particle identification cuts , @xmath99 for prompt kaons ( pions ) , to identify @xmath100 events . </S>",

    "<S> . frame . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the energy difference , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the energy of the @xmath14 candidate , @xmath108 is the energy of the @xmath104 candidate calculated from the measured momentum and assuming the pion mass,@xmath109 . with this definition , real @xmath110 events peak at @xmath111 even when they are misidentified as @xmath35 , while @xmath112 events peak around @xmath113 mev . </S>",
    "<S> event candidates are accepted if they have @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in case of multiple candidates from a single event </S>",
    "<S> , we choose the best candidate on the basis of a @xmath116 determined from the differences between the measured and nominal values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    to suppress the large combinatorial background from the two - jet like @xmath119 ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 ) continuum processes , variables that characterize the event topology are used . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a fisher discriminant @xmath124 , from 6 modified fox wolfram moments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath125 , the angle of the @xmath12 flight direction with respect to the beam axis is also used to distinguish signal from continuum background . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these two independent variables , @xmath124 and @xmath125 to make a single likelihood ratio variable ( @xmath126 ) that distinguishes signal from continuum background . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a different requirement for each sub - mode based on the expected signal yield and the backgrounds in the @xmath118 sideband data . for @xmath110 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 we require @xmath129 whereas for @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 we require @xmath132 . to give an example of the performance of this selection , the @xmath129 requirement keeps 87.5  % of the @xmath133\\pi^{-}$]signal while removing 73  % of the continuum background .    </S>",
    "<S> the signal yields are extracted from a fit to the @xmath134 distribution in the region @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath110 signal is parameterized as a double gaussian with peak position and width floated . on the other hand , we calibrate the shape parameters of the @xmath112 signal using the @xmath36 data . </S>",
    "<S> this accounts for the kinematical shifts and smearing of the @xmath134 peaks caused by the incorrect mass assignments of prompt hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the peak position and width of the @xmath136 signal events are determined by fitting the @xmath110 distribution using the kaon mass hypothesis for the prompt pion , where the relative peak position is reversed with respect to the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the shape parameters for the feed - across from @xmath110 are fixed by the fit results of the @xmath110 enriched sample . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum background is modeled as a first order polynomial function with parameters determined from the @xmath134 distribution for the events in the sideband region @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> backgrounds from other @xmath12 decays including contributions from @xmath138 and @xmath139 are modeled as a smoothed histogram from monte carlo simulation . </S>",
