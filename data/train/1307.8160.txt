    "in nuclear physics , _ ab initio _ approaches seek to solve the many - body schrdinger equation in terms of constituent protons and neutrons interacting through nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) and three - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) forces that yield a high - precision fit of two- and three - body data .",
    "their aim is twofold : firstly , to help unfold the true nature of the force among nucleons ; and secondly , to arrive at a fundamental understanding of nuclei and their role in the universe .    in the three- and four - nucleon systems , where a numerically exact solution of the quantum - mechanical problem for both negative  @xcite and positive energies  @xcite is now possible ,",
    "this goal has been largely achieved . for heavier systems , _ ab initio _ calculations have been mostly confined to the description of the bound - state properties of stable nuclei , but are now starting to be extended to dynamical processes between nuclei . the green s function monte carlo method has been used to describe the elastic scattering of neutrons on @xmath5he  @xcite and to compute asymptotic normalization coefficients  @xcite and nuclear widths  @xcite . loosely bound and unbound nuclear states have been addressed within the coupled cluster technique  @xcite by using a berggren basis and this method has been recently applied to compute elastic proton scattering on @xmath6ca  @xcite .",
    "an _ ab initio _ framework that promises to provide a unified treatment of a wide range of nuclear phenomena ( well - bound states , loosely - bound and unbound exotic nuclei , scattering and reaction observables ) is the no - core shell model with continuum ( ncsmc )  @xcite . here",
    ", the nuclear many - body states are seen as superimpositions of continuous @xmath7 binary - cluster wave functions in the spirit of the resonating group method ( rgm )  @xcite and square - integrable eigenstates of the @xmath8-nucleon system , in which each cluster of nucleons and the compound nuclear states are obtained within the _ ab inito _ no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have laid the foundations of the ncsmc by developing the formalism to compute nucleon - nucleus collisions and applying it to the description of the unbound @xmath9he nucleus .",
    "however , expansions on the ncsm / rgm portion of the basis  @xcite have been already successfully used to describe nucleon  @xcite and deuteron  @xcite scattering on light nuclei and achieve the first _ ab initio _ description of the @xmath9be@xmath10b radiative capture  @xcite and the @xmath11h@xmath12he and @xmath11he@xmath13he fusion rates  @xcite , based on realistic @xmath3 interactions .",
    "work is currently under way to incorporate the @xmath4 force into this binary - reaction formalism and to attain the description of deuteron - nucleus scattering and transfer reactions within the ncsmc approach .",
    "achieving an _ ab initio _ treatment of three - cluster dynamics is another important stepping stone towards gaining a basic understanding of nuclei and their reactions . to cite a few instances , important nuclear fusion processes such as the @xmath11h@xmath14h@xmath15he or @xmath11he@xmath14he@xmath16he reactions",
    "are characterized by three - body final states .",
    "in addition , only with an approach capable of accounting for three - cluster configurations can one obtain an accurate description of borromean nuclei , ternary systems of two nucleons orbiting around a tightly bound core whose components are not bound in pairs .",
    "finally , three - body configurations can be necessary even at very low energy to achieve a proper treatment of polarization and virtual excitations of breakup channels in reactions with weakly - bound projectiles such as the deuteron .",
    "microscopic three - cluster models , where all nucleons are taken into account and the pauli principle is treated exactly , have been used for some time , particularly in combination with the hyperspherical formalism for the solution of the dynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "however , they have two main limitations : the use of central @xmath3 potentials with state - dependent parameters adjusted to reproduce the binding energy of the system under study , occasionally complemented with a spin - orbit interaction ; and a simplified description of the internal structure of the clusters , which are in most cases described by @xmath17-shell wave functions . in this paper , we report on an extension of the ncsm / rgm formalism to treat the dynamics among three nuclei made of fully antisymmetrized interacting nucleons . the solution of the three - cluster schrdinger equation is obtained by means of hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) expansions on a lagrange mesh  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we present the first @xmath5he+@xmath1+@xmath1 investigation of the ground state ( g.s . )  of the @xmath18he nucleus based on a @xmath3 potential that yields a high - precision fit of the @xmath3 phase shifts and _ ab initio _ four - body wave functions for the @xmath5he cluster obtained consistently from the same hamiltonian . in particular , we employ a similarity - renormalization - group ( srg )  @xcite evolved chiral n@xmath11lo",

    "for this first application , we include only the g.s .  of the @xmath5he cluster and",
    "estimate the importance of the core polarization by comparing the results obtained with six - body ncsm diagonalizations of the adopted hamiltonian .",
    "the inclusion of excited states of @xmath5he to describe such effects is hard and not very efficient within the ncsm / rgm approach . on the other hand ,",
    "core - polarization effects will be easily accounted for once the present formalism will be embedded within the ncsmc framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formalism ] we define the microscopic three - cluster problem , present a brief overview of the hh functions and their application within the @xmath19-matrix method on lagrange mesh for the solution of the three - body bound - state problem , and introduce in detail the three - cluster ncsm / rgm formalism . in particular , in sec .",
