    "in 1984 , bb84 , the first quantum cryptographic protocol was proposed . for the next decade , the eavesdropper detection strategy , following the idea of bb84 , for almost all quantum cryptographic protocols",
    "is based on the random sample discussion . in this eavesdropper detection method , the check qubits are independent to the message qubits . by scrambling the message qubits",
    "with the check qubits together , the strategy assumes that an eavesdropper has no idea on discriminating a check qubit from a message qubit .",
    "an attempt to eavesdrop the qubit sequence by an outsider would only end up disturbing the check qubit states . and",
    ", the only chance for an eavesdropper detection is when the check qubits were altered `` inadvertently '' by the eavesdropper .",
    "hence , the more check qubits altered by an eavesdropper , the higher probability he / she is detected .    in order to increase the detection probability .",
    "the number of check qubits should be large enough , because the eavesdropper detection probability for interfering one check qubit is    @xmath0 where the @xmath1 represents the probability of the eavesdropper to choose a check qubit , and @xmath2 is the probability that the measurement result of that check qubit is different from what was expected due to the interference of that eavesdropper .",
    "most protocols suggest the number of check qubits should be at least the same as that of the message qubits transmitted @xcite .    however , there is a problem with the random sampling discussion strategy , especially when an eavesdropper just attempts to eavesdrop only a few qubits in the transmitted quantum sequence .",
    "in this situation , some information might be revealed , and the integrity of the message qubits might be jeopardized , but the eavesdropper detection probability could still be very low .",
    "most quantum cryptographic protocols ignore this problem and conversely assume that the eavesdropper always attempts to eavesdrop the entire sequence of qubits .",
    "consequently , the conclusion , the probability of eavesdropper detection can reach 1 , is asserted .",
    "this paper aims to design a quantum secret authentication code ( qsac ) to solve the above - mentioned problem .",
    "this qsac guarantees the integrity of the secret qubits transmitted from a sender to a receiver .",
    "furthermore , the intentionally designed avalanche effect guarantees the detection of an eavesdropping of even a single qubit in the quantum sequence .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the proposed quantum secret authentication code and the security analysis .",
    "section 3 gives an application of the proposed qsac .",
    "finally , conclusions are made in section 4 .",
    "in this section , a quantum secret authentication code ( qsac ) is proposed for a receiver to verify whether or not the received states are indeed from the alleged sender and without being eavesdropped or modified .",
    "00.00.0000    the pre - shared key between the sender and the receiver .",
    "concatenation .    the _ i _ th qubit in the quantum sequence _",
    "m_.    control - not gate , where _ a _ is the control qubit and _ b _ is the target qubit . if @xmath3 , then performs the identity operation _",
    "i_.      a cnot gate is applied here to create an avalanche effect in the qsac .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates an avalanche effect of the qsac .",
    "assume that there is a function _ f _ with a sequence of quantum states as the input and a sequence of entangled qubits as the output .",
    "the function is composed of a sequence of _ cnot _ operations .",
    "for example , let the input of the function be a three - qubit quantum state @xmath4 and the output , @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , the inverse function @xmath7 should be @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "an avalanche effect is described under a communication model between a sender and a receiver .",
    "first , the sender inputs the state , @xmath10 for example , to the function _ f _ and subsequently , _",
    "f _ outputs the state @xmath10__. _ _ then the sender sends the qubits @xmath10 to the receiver via a quantum channel . during the time of transmission , if there is no eavesdropper , then the same state @xmath10 will be received and recovered by the receiver , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "conversely , assume the last qubit is altered by an outsider , i.e. , the state received by the receiver becomes @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , the receiver inputs the received state @xmath12 to @xmath7 , the inversion of the function _ f. _ the state that the receiver finally recovers is @xmath13 .",
    "obviously , one single qubit modification eventually causes more than one qubits to change .",
    "figure 2 shows the procedure of the qsac .",
    "the sender first inputs the message qubits , @xmath14 , and the shared key , _ k , _ to the qsac algorithm .",
    "the qsac algorithm generates check qubits from _ k _ and outputs a qsac codeword which strongly entangles the message qubits and the check qubits .",
    "then , the sender sends the qsac codeword to the receiver . for verification ,",
    "the receiver inputs the received codeword and the shared key _",
    "k _ to the verification algorithm to `` extract '' the message qubits and the check qubits . finally , by verifying the correctness of the check qubits , the receiver can verify whether or not the message qubits are indeed from the legitimate participant and are without eavesdropping on modifications from an outsider .",
    "the following steps demonstrate the encoding of the proposed qsac .",
    "the inputs are the secret message qubits @xmath14 of length _",
    "m _ and the key _",
    "k _ of length _ k _ bits shared between the sender and the receiver .",
    "00.00.0000    extend the key _",
    "k _ to @xmath15 and @xmath15 and    transform @xmath15 to a quadratic string @xmath16 of length _",
    "n _ and every element of @xmath16 is in @xmath17 , where _",
    "n _ is the security parameter determines the number of check qubits .",
    "then , a sequence of check qubits @xmath18 can be generated according to @xmath16 .",
    "the elements in \\{0,1,2,3 } of @xmath16 represents the states of check qubits , respectively .",
    "that is , if the element in @xmath16 is `` 0 '' , then the state `` @xmath19 '' is produced and so on .",
    "for example , if @xmath16 is `` 012130 '' , then the check qubits should be  @xmath20  .",
    "attach the message qubits to the check qubits as @xmath21 .",
    "transform @xmath22 to a digit string @xmath23 of length _ ( n+m ) _ and every element of @xmath23 is in _ .",
    "_ perform _ cnot _ operations among the qubits of @xmath24 according to represents the index of the control qubits in @xmath24 and the corresponding value of that element in is the index of the target qubit in @xmath24 . in other words ,",
    "the cnot operation is performed on the @xmath25 qubit in @xmath24 , as the control qubit and the in @xmath24 for example , if    .example of step4 in qsac [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     transform @xmath15 to a quadratic string @xmath16 of length _",
    "n _ and every element of @xmath16 is in @xmath17 . with @xmath16 ,",
    "the receiver knows the original states of the check qubits the sender prepared .",
    "consequently , the receiver measures the check qubits extracted from the qsac codeword with the corresponding bases .",
    "that is , if the element of @xmath26 is equal to 0 or 1 ; otherwise x - basis is used .",
    "if the in @xmath16 is the same as the measurement result of the check qubits recovered from the qsac codeword , then the secret message qubits are authenticated .",
    ": :         this section analyzes the features of the proposed qsac including : ( 1 ) the integrity of the secret message qubits , and ( 2 ) the originality of the secret message qubits .",
    "the secret message integrity ensures that the received message qubits are not eavesdropped and modified during the time of transmission in an open quantum channel .",
    "conversely , if the message qubits are eavesdropped or modified , then with a high probability the receiver can detect the interference . to analyze the integrity ,",
    "let us denote the message qubits to be transmitted as @xmath14 , the check qubits created from the key , _",
    "k , _ as @xmath27 , and the qsac codeword state after executing the qsac encoding algorithm as @xmath28 . assume the qsac codeword state , @xmath28 , was modified by a malicious user into the other state @xmath29 .",
    "upon receiving @xmath29 , the receiver executes the verification function and recovers the state to @xmath30 . if @xmath31 , then the only situation that the modification passes the verification process is : ( a ) a collision occurs , which means that the check qubits @xmath32 extracted from @xmath30 is the same as the check qubits @xmath27 produced from _",
    "k _ , or ( b ) @xmath33 , but their measurement results are the same .",
    "assume that the probability for the situation ( a ) to occur is @xmath34 .",
    "hence , the probability for the situation ( b ) to occur is @xmath35 , where the the probability for @xmath32 to have the same measurement result as @xmath27 , when @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the total probability for the modification to pass the verification process when @xmath31 is :    @xmath36 where    @xmath37 it is noted if the length of check qubits is large enough , then @xmath34 could approach to zero .",
    "the @xmath38 thus is equal to @xmath39 . since @xmath39 is the probability for @xmath33 , @xmath39 could be express as : @xmath40 .",
    "let us assume that only one single qubits ( e.g. , the @xmath41th check qubit ) was modified .",
    "as an example , if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 could be @xmath44 or @xmath45 . similarly , if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 and so on . in any case ,",
    "@xmath48 . hence if _",
    "j _ check qubits are modified , then @xmath49 . if the length , _",
    "n _ , of check qubits is large enough , then due to the avalanche effect , @xmath50    the message originality means that the receiver can verify whether the message is sent from the same participant whom he / she claimed to be . to impersonate the sender ,",
    "an eavesdropper must input a guessed key _",
    "k _ to the qsac encoding algorithm to generate a codeword @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath52 , then the situation for @xmath51 to pass the verification process is exactly the same as the one described above , whose possibility , @xmath53 , can be ignored .",
    "note that the main difference between the random sampling discussion and the qsac is in the basic assumption for eavesdropper detection .",
    "the former assumes that the number of check qubits `` altered '' by an eavesdropper should be large enough , whereas the latter ( qsac ) assumes that the number of check qubits `` set '' by the designer is large enough .",
    "hence , for an eavesdropper to be detected with a high probability in the random sampling discussion , both the number of the check qubits as well as the number of check qubits altered by the eavesdropper should be large enough .",
    "conversely , due to the design of an avalanche effect on the qsac , for a higher eavesdropper detection rate , it requires only a large enough number of check qubits in the qsac .",
    "furthermore , to make an eavesdropper inadvertently alter enough check qubits in the random sampling approach , the positions of those check qubits should be unknown to the eavesdropper before these check qubits are received by the receiver .",
    "then , the sender and the receiver have to communicate back and forth in an authenticated channel later to discuss of the states , positions , and measurement results of these check qubits to judge the existence of an eavesdropper .",
    "on the other hand , in the qsac , these overheads can be removed altogether .",
    "the communication between the sender and the receiver can be simplified to just a one - way communication .",
    "to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed qsac , a quantum secure direct communication with authentication based on the deng s two - step qsdc@xcite is demonstrated . instead of assuming the existence of authenticated classical channels , we assume that the sender and the receiver pre - share a secret key _ k _ via some secure ways .",
    "00.00.0000    the sender prepares a sequence of epr states in @xmath54 .",
    "the sender encodes his / her classical secret message into a message qubits by performing one of the four operations @xmath55 on the epr state , which represent the two - bit classical information @xmath56 respectively .",
    "subsequently , the sender encodes the message qubits to a qsac codeword , and then sends it to the receiver .    upon receiving the qsac codeword ,",
    "the receiver decodes the qsac codeword and verifies the correctness of the recovered check qubits .",
    "if the codeword is authenticated , then the receiver performs bell measurement on the epr state to recover the secret message ; otherwise they abort the communication .    in the original two - step protocol in @xcite ,",
    "the epr pairs should be transmitted separately in two steps in order to protect the security of the message .",
    "furthermore the sender and the receiver have to perform public discussions via an authenticated classical channel to detect the existence of eavesdroppers",
    ". however , with the design of the qsac , these can be done within one step and without any tedious public discussion to detect the existence of an eavesdropper .",
    "using the inherent characteristic in quantum of being very susceptible to be eavesdropped , this paper proposes a qsac to protect quantum state sequence from being eavesdropped or modified arbitrarily . as compared to the conventionally used strategy  the random sample discussion , the qsac provides efficiency in quantum sequence communication as well as ease in the design of quantum cryptographic protocols .",
    "the assumption of existence of authenticated classical channels in almost all existing quantum cryptographic protocols can be removed . instead , a secret key is assumed to be shared between a sender and a receiver , which is a more common and practical assumption in modern cryptography .",
    "a qsac - based qsdc is designed to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed qsac in the design of various quantum cryptographic protocols .",
    "on one hand , though the strongly self - entangled qsac codeword makes itself very difficult to be forged or interfered without detection . on the other",
    ", it is quite susceptible to noises in a quantum channel",
    ". therefore , how to design a qsac , which is robust under a noisy and lossy quantum channel would be a very interesting future research .",
