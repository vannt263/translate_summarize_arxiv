    "new era of physics beyond the standard quark - lepton physics has been opened by the superkamiokande collaboration who has provided the convincing evidence on atmospheric neutrino oscillations.@xcite there have also been other observed anomalous phenomena suggesting that neutrinos are oscillating , which are often referred to the solar neutrino deficit @xcite and to the lsnd signal@xcite .",
    "such neutrino oscillations are only possible if neutrinos are massive@xcite .",
    "the well known theoretical frameworks realizing neutrino oscillations are based either on a seesaw mechanism@xcite implying a huge mass scale such as the unification scale or on a radiative mechanism@xcite employing extra higgs bosons at the electroweak scale .",
    "these observed oscillations could be explained in general by the simultaneous oscillations among three known neutrinos , @xmath8@xcite .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to assume that these phenomena really occur as a result of the oscillations involving only two neutrino species . along this line of thought",
    ", it has been suggested that transitions of @xmath9 ( atmospheric ) , @xmath10 ( solar ) and @xmath11 ( lsnd ) explain neutrino oscillations indicated by the observed data , where @xmath3 is a sterile neutrino with no interactions in the standard model@xcite .    in the radiative mechanism@xcite",
    ", an extra higgs doublet is required to yield a coupling to a charged higgs singlet that interacts with a neutrino - charged lepton pair .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses comes from the smallness of charged lepton masses and from feeble couplings associated with interactions of the neutrino - charged lepton pairs .",
    "the extensive analyses on neutrino physics arising from the radiative mechanism have been performed in detail@xcite and have shown that the radiative mechanism gives consistent results with the observed data .",
    "therefore , it is of quite importance to construct a gauge model that includes a sterile neutrino . in the recent study done by n. gaur _",
    "et al._@xcite , it has been explicitly demonstrated how the sterile neutrino scenario works well in their model with radiatively generated neutrino masses . since all neutrinos are kept massless at the tree level , a sterile neutrino , which is a gauge singlet in the standard model , should be protected from acquiring a majorana mass .",
    "the simplest mechanism is based on an extra @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "if the scenario really shoots the right way to go beyond physics of the standard model , there must exist a physical reason of the need for the @xmath12 symmetry@xcite .    in this report",
    ", the mass protection @xmath12 symmetry is identified with another hypercharge in the standard model . the extended gauge symmetry to be studied",
    "is @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath14 @xmath16 @xmath14 @xmath17 , where the first and second families respect @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 while @xmath16 @xmath14 @xmath17 is specific for the third family@xcite .",
    "since the third family carries different quantum numbers from those of the first and second families , through mixing effects due to extra gauge bosons , @xmath18 and @xmath19 interactions with the third family will differ from those with the first and second families .",
    "investigation of phenomenological effects due to the non - universality specific to the third family is of great interest@xcite ; however , this subject will be discussed in a separate article@xcite .",
    "one may wonder if the quark mixings with the third family are realized to occur .",
    "in fact , the mixings can not be accommodated unless a new interaction is introduced .",
    "a possible mechanism will be briefly discussed in the last section . in the present discussions , we concentrate on the study of radiative mechanism by simply assuming that these extra gauge bosons are heavy enough . in the next section , a gauge model based on @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath14 @xmath16 @xmath14 @xmath17",
