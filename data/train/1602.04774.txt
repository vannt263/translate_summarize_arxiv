    "magnetic trapping is a commonly used technique @xcite to confine atoms within a small region of space in order to study their precise quantum mechanical behaviour in the laboratory .",
    "wide range of experimental studies on ultracold atoms exploit such technique and remarkable experimental success have been achieved in this direction in recent times . for further improvements in magnetic",
    "trapping to overcome its drawbacks , various addition in the technical and theoretical sides have also been introduced .",
    "one of the improved traps which is the central interest of this article is the time orbiting potential ( top ) trap @xcite .",
    "it was successfully exploited to confine bosons at an ultracold temperature to achieve one of the noble states of matter , bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite . +",
    "a top trap is a modified version of quadrupole magnetic field trap ( qmft ) , where an additional rotating magnetic field is added along with the original magnetic field of qmft . in qmft ,",
    "the atoms which are weak field seekers @xcite are attracted towards the minima of the magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong field seekers fly off the trap @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the minimum in qmft has a zero magnetic field , which makes the separation between the zeeman levels of the atom negligibly small ( practically zero ) .",
    "hence , weak field seekers in the vicinity of the minima flip to strong field seeker states and leave the trap @xcite . to prevent this from happening , a rotating magnetic field is added to qmft and this new trap is called top trap . + the rotating field component of the top trap forces the minimum of the magnetic field to rotate in a circle of radius @xmath0 @xcite , where , @xmath1 is the magnitude of the rotating field and @xmath2 designates the static magnetic field configuration of qmft . until now , in the analysis of top trap , a time averaged description has been adopted , which makes the minimum of the field configuration a non - zero time independent quantity .",
    "therefore , by avoiding the possible flipping between weak and strong field seeker state , top trap can be utilized successfully to trap atoms in the laboratory .",
    "the concept of time averaged field is physically allowed when the rotation frequency @xmath3 of @xmath1 is large enough . in principle , to validate the analysis at arbitrarily small time scale , one must introduce a rotating field with a frequency @xmath3 , which is infinitely large .",
    "+ besides this , top trap involves other important scales like larmor frequency @xmath4 of the atom , which is proportional to the magnetic field strength of the trap . to avoid the possibility of spin flipping transition",
    ", the adiabatic condition @xmath5 @xcite has to be maintained .",
    "therefore , for a successful trapping of neutral atom , the rotation frequency @xmath3 can not be made arbitrarily large .",
    "one can always introduce very high intensity magnetic field , such that @xmath4 itself becomes very large and hence , time averaged description becomes possible to describe the system even in a very small time - scale .",
    "however , in a weak magnetic environment , the concept of time - averaging field is completely impossible in the light of the analysis presented below .",
    "+ until now , we have not mentioned about the oscillation of atom inside the trap but this oscillation frequency is also a crucial scale for the trap under consideration . to be precise",
    ", for a successful top trapping the following condition has to be obeyed @xcite , @xmath6 where , @xmath7 , is the frequency of oscillation of atom cloud inside the trap and @xmath8 is given by , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the magnetic moment of the atom . + in order to make @xmath11 arbitrarily small , one must reduce the ratio @xmath12 arbitrarily .",
    "but , this can make the radius @xmath13 of the circle of death @xcite arbitrarily large .",
    "therefore , we need a judicious arrangement of this three different frequencies .",
    "eq.(1 ) is a sufficient criterion for trapping of weak field seekers in a top trap , in this context , here we would like to raise the question _ is it necessary ? _",
    "the answer is no and we will see that explicitly in this article . therefore , we can relax the condition ( 1 ) and can avoid the difficulties arising from the complex adjustment of these above mentioned frequencies ( or time scales ) .",
    "furthermore , _ we would like to know whether adiabatic evolution of weak field seeker state is at all necessary for a successful top trapping_. our present work is devoted towards addressing these two relevant queries .",
    "+ we have organized the article in the following way .",
    "after the introduction , we have discussed the necessary and sufficient criteria for adiabatic evolution of weak field seeker states . in section",
    "ii , we have examined the time evolution of the state without adopting any time averaged description of the magnetic field .",
    "we have solved the schrdinger equation explicitly to show how far one can trap the weak field seeker state even if they do not go thorough an adiabatic evolution . at the end",
    ", we have summarized our investigations and have discussed the importance and possibilities of our findings .",
    "for a complete quantum mechanical treatment , we consider atoms in weak field seeker state .",
    "let us choose a coordinate system ( x , y , z ) where the magnetic moment of the atom is written as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gyromagnetic ratio . in this coordinate system",
    "we express the magnetic field configuration corresponding to the top trap as @xcite , @xmath16.\\ ] ] we know that the field minima always lies in the @xmath17 plane and atom cloud is confined in the vicinity of the field minima . due to the rotating magnetic field it rotates in @xmath18 plane ( say @xmath19 ) .",
    "the atom also executes an oscillation about the minima with the frequency @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the weak field seeker atom is necessarily confined within the specified plane . obviously , the magnetic field in that specified plane has dependence on spatial coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the only time dependence appears due to the rotating field .",
    "it is evident that , at every point on the plane the total magnetic field @xmath22 rotates about the z axis .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian corresponding to such magnetic field can be expressed as , @xmath23 @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is the angle between the z - component of the magnetic moment ( @xmath10 ) and the magnetic field @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the azimuthal angle in the plane containing the atom cloud . for a simpler demonstration of our idea ,",
    "we have considered a two level atom whose magnetic moment is defined in terms of @xmath28 pauli matrices .",
    "we admit that this is not the most general case but for a multilevel bosonic or fermionic atoms , the technique can easily be generalized .",
    "we leave those complicated issues here .",
    "+ now , for a small radius r of the circle of death , the spatial variation of @xmath25 and @xmath4 can be neglected and considered approximately as a constant quantity inside the circle .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian in a matrix form can be written as , @xmath29 now , there are two different possibilities left for a weak field seeker state in a time dependent magnetic field",
    ". the state can either remain as weak field seeker state ( adiabatic evolution ) or it can flip non - adiabatically to a strong field seeker state and flies off the trap . obviously , the category of the evolution depends on how rapidly the hamiltonian of the system changes with respect to the internal time scale characterized by the energy gap of the two level system .",
    "for a successful trapping , the system has to go through the adiabatic evolution , for which , the following criterion must be obeyed @xcite , @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( strong and weak field seeker state ) are the instantaneous eigen states of @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the corresponding energy eigenvalues of strong and weak field seeker state , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "plugging these two states in above equation , we arrive to the condition for adiabatic evolution as , @xmath38    hence , _ we see that @xmath39 , though a sufficient criteria is not necessary for the adiabatic evolution of weak field seeker state inside a top trap _ as the angle @xmath25 also plays a crucial role .",
    "this gives us a clear answer to our first question we have raised in the introduction of this article .",
    "one can take advantage of this fact that , even a weak magnetic field ( for which the larmor frequency @xmath4 is less than @xmath3 ) can be applied to trap atom by suitably choosing alignment of @xmath40 in such a way that , @xmath41 becomes very small .",
    "at this juncture , @xmath42let s turn back to second important question raised by us earlier in this article . to answer this , one must solve schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian in eq.(4 ) with the initial state @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "the evolved state can be written as the linear combination of the instantaneous eigenstates of time dependent hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "let s call it , @xmath45 added to that , we avoid any time averaging concept and hence by making it a general treatment applicable to any arbitrarily small time scale .",
    "+ now , plugging eq.(7 ) in the schrdinger equation , @xmath46 we arrive to a set of coupled differential equations @xcite , @xmath47\\alpha(t)-\\frac{i}{2}\\dot{\\phi}(t)\\beta(t)\\sin\\theta = 0\\ ] ] @xmath48\\alpha(t)-\\frac{i}{2}\\dot{\\phi}(t)\\alpha(t)\\sin\\theta = 0\\ ] ] hence , by solving them with the initial condition @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 , we have @xmath52\\sin \\frac{\\bar{\\omega}t}{2}\\ ] ] @xmath53 where , @xmath54 + from these two coefficients @xmath55 @xmath50 @xmath56 we can calculate the survival probability of weak field seeker state at any instant t , given by , @xmath57 ^ 2}{\\bar{\\omega}^2 } \\sin^2\\frac{\\bar{\\omega}t}{2}.\\ ] ] similarly , the transition probability ( loss ) from weak field to strong field seekers state is given by , @xmath58 now , we consider a case where @xmath4 is not much larger than @xmath3 and @xmath25 is not negligibly small . in that case",
    "the time evolution of weak field seeker state is absolutely non adiabatic .",
    "the survival probability @xmath59 shows an oscillatory pattern which is shown in fig.(1 and 2 ) , considering two different values of @xmath3 @xmath60 for different @xmath25 .",
    "it is evident that the amplitude of oscillations decays with both @xmath61 and @xmath62 and becomes constant ( equals to unity ) for @xmath63 or for @xmath64 , which eventually boils down to the adiabatic evolution of weak field seeker state .",
    ", the survival probabilities for different values of @xmath25 show comparatively smaller values of amplitudes of oscillation .",
    "+ ]    , the survival probabilities for different values of @xmath25 show comparatively smaller values of amplitudes of oscillation .",
    "+ ]    , the resurrection time @xmath65 reaches a local maxima at @xmath66 and then decreases with @xmath67 and the dashed line shows that @xmath65 decreases monotonically with @xmath67 for the parameter region @xmath68 . ]",
    "this is indeed very interesting as we can see that , though the weak field seeker state flips into a strong field seeking one but , resurrects again after a time @xmath69 . in the unit of @xmath70 , @xmath71 can be expressed as , @xmath72    the resurrection time @xmath65 is an emergent time scale , composed of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "now , the trap for which the weak field seekers take more than the resurrection time to fly off , are permanently confined because , before they leave the trap , they become weak field seekers again , hence , are pulled towards the minima and it is always possible to design such a trap accordingly .",
    "so , we realize without any doubt that , the atom can still be trapped beyond adiabatic limit and this gives us a clear answer to our second query_. + for more precise and quantitative understanding of @xmath65 , we have presented two plots corresponding to two different regime of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "3 shows that within the range @xmath73 the quantity @xmath65 initially increases from unity and reaches a local maxima equals to @xmath74 at ( @xmath75 ) and then decreases with ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "therefore , for a fixed value of @xmath25 within the above mentioned range , @xmath65 never can be bigger than cosec@xmath25 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath77 , @xmath65 monotonically decreases with ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "for both the above mentioned domains of @xmath25 , a very large value of ( @xmath76 ) corresponds to the adiabatic domain of time evolution , where @xmath65 is almost equals to zero .",
    "this simply signifies that , the weak field seeker states never flip to strong field seeker states during the course of their evolution . on the other hand when @xmath76 is infinitesimally small the quantity @xmath65 becomes unity .",
    "now , for a very large value of @xmath3 weak field seeker atom takes infinitesimally small time to resurrect completely .",
    "this is very much counter - intuitive from the conventional understanding of top trap , as in such a situation the evolution of atoms is highly non adiabatic only with exceptions when @xmath25 is either close to zero or @xmath78 . in other word",
    ", a highly non adiabatic case might be a favourable situation for a successful trapping of atom .",
    "to conclude we have explored two important aspects of a top trap .",
    "the first one is the necessary and sufficient condition for adiabatic evolution of weak field seeker states inside the trap . in this context , for the first time , we have realized the importance of the parameter @xmath25 , which plays a crucial role in the determination of the category of time evolution . for a suitable value of the parameter @xmath25",
    ", we can restore the adiabatic evolution of weak field seeker states no matter how large is the frequency @xmath3 compared to the larmor frequency ( @xmath4 ) of the system .",
    "this gives us a freedom to relax the well known criterion ( 1 ) for successful trapping of atoms .",
    "added to that we have pointed out that the atom can also be trapped instead of their non adiabatic evolution .",
    "we have arrived to these two conclusions with a purely quantum mechanical approach without adopting any time averaged description of the magnetic field .",
    "this also helps us to avoid semi classical picture hitherto conventional treatment on the specific topic . in the experimental side ,",
    "our findings offers a nice opportunity for a less restricted magnetic trap .",
    "now , even employing a weak magnetic field one can successfully trap atoms in the laboratory .",
    "we sincerely admit that so far our analysis is based on the consideration of a two level system but a technical generalization for multilevel system is no longer far removed .",
    "we leave that task aside for a separate article in near future .",
