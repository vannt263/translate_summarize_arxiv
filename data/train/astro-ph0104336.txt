    "the search for extra - solar planets came to fruition in 1992 when alex wolszczan ( 1992 ) discovered the first confirmed extra - solar planets orbiting the pulsar 1257 + 12 . since wolszczan s discovery ,",
    "conventional optical searches have found a number of extra - solar planets , biased towards the so - called `` hot jovians '' , typified by 51 peg @xcite .",
    "the observing techniques , measurement of low amplitude periodic doppler shifts in the primary , bias such searches towards high mass planets with short orbital periods .",
    "recently the nature of these systems , gaseous giant planets in short period orbits , was confirmed by the observation of a transit in the hd 209458 system @xcite .    a second pulsar - planet system has also been observed .",
    "psr  b1620 - 26 in the globular cluster m4 is a binary pulsar with a low mass white dwarf secondary in a @xmath1 au near circular orbit @xcite . in 1993",
    "backer et al discovered the presence of a second orbiting companion , conjectured to be have a planet mass @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations have confirmed the presence of a second companion around 1620 - 26 .",
    "the second companion has sub - stellar mass and it is near certain that the object is a planet @xcite .",
    "m4 is a modest , relatively low metallicity cluster , and the most plausible formation scenario requires that the planet was exchanged into the pulsar system during an encounter with a main  sequence star in the cluster @xcite .",
    "the implication is that jovian mass planets must exist around at least some of the main - sequence stars in relatively low metallicity globular clusters .",
    "the progenitor system of the m4 planet must have had the planet in a wide orbit just before the exchange encounter ( @xmath2 ) , in order for it to have been plausibly exchanged into the current configuration .",
    "recently , a _ hubble space telescope _ project ( go-8267 ) carried out a transit search for `` hot jovians '' in the globular cluster 47 tucanae .",
    "the observations involved the continuous monitoring of several tens of thousands of stars using wf / pc2 and stis .",
    "the basic technique was to take short ( few minute ) exposures , primarily alternating i and v band . a single field in the cluster , with the pc chip centered on the edge of the cluster core ,",
    "was monitored continuously for over 8 days .",
    "the search is sensitive to jovian sized planets with orbital periods @xmath3 days , orbiting main - sequence stars in the cluster .",
    "a detection requires two observations of a dimming of a few millimagnitudes in both bands , lasting several hours ( typical transit times scales are 3 hours ) .",
    "only relative photometry is required , and about 34,000 stars were monitored simultaneously .",
    "if the distribution of orbital parameters of jovian planets in 47 tuc is comparable to that in the stellar neighbourhood , for short orbital periods , then given a random orientation of orbital planes , the search should discover some 1520 51 peg like planets .",
    "globular clusters are crowded environments .",
    "binary systems undergo dynamical interactions with nearby stars , and close encounters can lead to large changes in orbital parameters , including the disruption of the system @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to consider the probability of a planetary system surviving for a time comparable to the hubble time in the inner regions of globular cluster , and the possible dynamical evolution of high mass ratio binaries in such environments .",
    "considerable work has been done on this problem , including the pioneering analysis of heggie ( 1975 ) and the numerical experiments of hills ( 1975 ) and hut & bahcall ( 1983 ) , and more recently simulations directed at specific problems in globular clusters @xcite . relatively little",
    "work has been done on the problem of very high mass ratio systems appropriate to planetary encounters , sigurdsson ( 1992 ) considered the basic problem , laughlin & adams calculated mean disruption rates for open clusters ( 1998 ) , and bonnell & kroupa ( 1998 ) looked at the issue in the context of planet formation .",
    "hills ( 1984 ) considered close encounters between a star - planet system and an intruder star .",
    "hills & dissly ( 1989 ) extended this work to consider a range of impact velocities and intruder masses .",
    "for the m4 system , considerable effort has been made to simulate its possible dynamical history and the implications of the existence of such a system @xcite .",
    "47 tucanae is a massive and quite dense cluster .",
    "the central density is about @xmath4 with central velocity dispersion of @xmath5 .",
    "the core radius is about 0.5 pc and the half - mass radius about 3.9 pc @xcite . at the half mass radius",
    "the number density of stars is about a factor of ten lower than in the core .",
    "encounters between two stars will be extremely rare in the low - density environment of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "however , in the cores of globular clusters number densities are sufficiently high ( @xmath6 stars / pc@xmath7 in some systems ) that encounter timescales can be comparable , or even less than , the age of the universe . in other words , a large fraction of the stars in these systems",
    "will have suffered from at least one close encounter or collision in their lifetime .",
    "the cross section for two stars , having a relative velocity at infinity of @xmath8 , to pass within a distance @xmath9 is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the relative velocity of the two stars at closest approach in a parabolic encounter ( _ i.e .  _",
    "@xmath12 ) .",
    "the second term is due to the attractive gravitational force , and is referred to as gravitational focussing . if @xmath13 as will be the case in systems with low velocity dispersions , such as globular clusters , @xmath14 .",
    "one may estimate the timescale for a given star to undergo an encounter , @xmath15 . for clusters with low velocity dispersions ,",
    "we thus obtain    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the number density of single stars of mass @xmath18 .",
    "we may estimate the timescale for an encounter between a star - planet system and a single star , in a similar manner where now @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit .",
    "the encounter timescale for such a system may therefore be relatively short as the semi - major axis can greatly exceed stellar radii .",
    "for example , a planetary system with @xmath21 , will have an encounter timescale @xmath22 years in the core of a dense globular cluster .",
    "encounters between single stars and binary systems will lead to the break up of the binaries when the kinetic energy of the incoming star exceeds the binding energy of the binary .",
    "this will be the case when @xmath23 , where    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the mass of the primary , @xmath26 the mass of the secondary and @xmath27 is the mass of the incoming , single star .",
    "binaries vulnerable to break up are often referred to as being _ soft _",
    "@xcite . in the case of encounters between single stars and a star - planet system",
    ", the latter will be invariably soft as @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "we would therefore expect the planetary system to be broken up with some high probability , when an intruding star passed within a distance @xmath20 of the planetary - system star ( but see sigurdsson 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , more distant encounters may leave the planets in somewhat eccentric orbits , as will be discussed later .",
    "the importance of encounters between a planetary system and binaries is a function of the binary fraction within the cluster , which is not well known .",
    "for encounters involving a single intruding star , we used a code based on the one discussed in davies , benz & hills ( 1993 ) . for encounters involving binaries ( four objects ) , we used a code based on the one discussed in bacon , sigurdsson & davies ( 1996 ) .",
    "the initial conditions for the scatterings were set following the method of hut & bahcall ( 1983 , see also sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) .",
    "with two binaries , we have additional parameters from the relative phase of the second binary , the orientation of the plane of the second binary and the second binary mass ratio , semi  major axis and eccentricity .",
    "we drew the binary parameters by monte carlo selection uniformly over the phase variables .",
    "the relative velocity at infinity of the centres  of  mass of the two binaries , @xmath29 was chosen uniformly on the interval allowed .",
    "the initial binary eccentricities , @xmath30 were zero for all encounters , previous calculations indicate the cross  sections of interest are not sensitive to the binaries eccentricities .    for encounters involving single stars , the equations of motion",
    "are rescaled using the heggie ( 1972 ) quasi regularisation and are integrated using the variable - order , variable - stepsize shampine - gordon integrator ( 1975 ) . for encounters involving binaries , a bulirsch ",
    "stoer variable step integrator with ks  chain regularisation ( aarseth 1984 , mikkola 1983 , 1984a , b ) was used for integrating the motion of the particles .",

    "note that sigurdsson ( 1992 ) assumed a stellar density @xmath86 times smaller for 47 tuc and derived a correspondingly longer time scale for breakup in the core .",
    "additional uncertainty is introduced by the time evolution of the 47 tuc stellar density profile .",
    "if the cluster is evolving through normal relaxation , then it was substantially less dense in the centre a few billion years ago .",
    "however , there is some suggestion that the cluster may already have evolved through a dense core phase @xcite in which case rate of destruction of tightly bound planetary systems may have been an order of magnitude higher in the recent past . in either case ,",
    "theory predicts little or no evolution in the stellar density near the half  mass radius , and the wf / pc2 field extends out from the core out almost to the half  mass radius . on the other hand ,",
    "there are more stars to be oberved in the denser parts of the cluster and the prior expectation therefore that most planets should have been found in the densest part of the observed field , assuming no dynamical disruption took place .",
    "it should also be noted that simulations of the evolution of multiple planetary systems suggest that a relatively slight perturbation in the eccentricity of one or more planets may lead to a radical rearrangement of the system in a short timescale @xcite thus we note that encounters that perturb the planets may play a role in the evolution of planetary systems , even in relatively low - density short - lived stellar clusters .",
    "for example , if @xmath87 stars / pc@xmath7 , @xmath88 years , for @xmath89 au .    in terms of the current survey in 47 tuc ,",
    "it would seem possible that all planetary systems have been destroyed if all the stars in the survey were located in the highest - density regions . given that some of the stars observed are in regions with an order of magnitude smaller stellar density , it is difficult to explain away all the expected detections .",
    "however , there are fewer stars observed in the low - density regions of the cluster , so if the intrinsic specific density of 51 peg like systems is somewhat lower than in the solar neighbourhood , then we might have expected more like 5 - 10 detections from observing 34,000 stars , and 75% of those in the densest regions . in order for direct dynamical disruption to explain the absence of 51 peg like systems , one still requires either a past denser phase for the core , or a very long time spent at the current density . the minimum average density for the environment of a given planetary system required for its destruction being @xmath90 stars / pc@xmath7 . from our calculations here ,",
    "we conclude that tight planetary systems ( @xmath55 au ) will definitely survive in less - dense clusters where subsequent surveys should be conducted .",
