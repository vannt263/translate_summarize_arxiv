    "as we enter the era of the lhc experiments , it is appropriate to examine the features of various approaches to electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "one of the latest attempts for describing ewsb is the proposal of refs .",
    "@xcite . in this approach , a judiciously chosen set of boundary conditions in a 5@xmath1 higgsless @xmath0 model",
    "gives rise to a pattern of gauge boson masses and couplings that are similar to those obtained in the standard model ( sm ) via a higgs doublet condensate .",
    "the geometry of this model is based on the randall  sundrum ( rs ) hierarchy solution @xcite , where two branes reside at the boundaries of a 5@xmath1 anti - de sitter space . in this scenario ,",
    "the boundary conditions give rise to the breaking chain @xmath17 at the planck scale with the subsequent breaking @xmath18 at the tev scale .",
    "after the planck scale symmetry breaking occurs , a global @xmath19 symmetry remains in the brane picture ; this breaks on the tev  brane to a diagonal group @xmath5 corresponding to the custodial @xmath20 symmetry present in the sm @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that due to the presence of the @xmath5 custodial symmetry , this warped higgsless model ( whm ) enjoys good agreement with precision ew data at the level of a few percent .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite and demonstrated @xcite that the region of parameter space in the whm that results in good agreement with the ew data leads to perturbative unitarity violation ( puv ) in @xmath21 scattering at energies of order @xmath3 tev .",
    "furthermore , a scan of the parameter space of the whm shows that the scale of perturbative unitarity violation is never significantly raised , even in those regions where comparisons with the precision measurements are anticipated to be quite poor @xcite . to restore unitarity in gauge boson scattering ,",
    "additional new physics is required at or below the rs cutoff of the effective theory on the tev  brane .",
    "even though this does not by itself rule out the model , it suggests that interactions in the gauge sector are problematic above the tev scale .    to address some of these issues , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have examined the effects of including ir(tev)brane terms for the @xmath2 and the custodial @xmath5 gauge symmetries .",
    "it is well - known that the introduction of brane terms can alter the couplings and masses of the corresponding kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower states @xcite and this would hence affect their contributions to the precision ew observables and to @xmath21 scattering .",
    "these authors concluded that the addition of the @xmath2 brane term could lead to improved agreement with the ew data , and , in addition , lowers the mass of the lightest kk state to @xmath22 300 gev .",
    "light kk states are generically expected to help restore perturbative unitarity in high energy gauge boson scattering , however the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite did not quantify this point .    in this paper",
    ", we also study the effects of the ir ",
    "brane kinetic terms associated with both the @xmath2 and @xmath5 symmetries ; here , we pay particular attention to low energy perturbative unitarity violation . for the @xmath2 boundary term , we find that the scale of puv in the model is _ independent _ of the size of the brane term .",
    "we also demonstrate that increasing the ratio of the 5@xmath1 couplings , @xmath23 , improves the agreement with the tree - level sm relations in the electroweak sector , but lowers the scale at which perturbative unitarity is violated , similar to our previous results @xcite . in the case of the @xmath5 kinetic term",
    ", we find that perturbative unitarity violation in @xmath21 scattering could be delayed to center of mass energies of order @xmath7 tev .",
    "however , agreement with the tree - level sm relations is rather poor , with the disparity worsening as the size of the @xmath5 brane term increases .",
    "in addition , we compare the predictions for the lowest lying gauge kk state to the searches for new gauge bosons at the tevatron run i and ii and for contact interactions at lep ii and find that the collider bounds restrict the potential size of the ir ",
    "brane kinetic terms . however , these collider bounds allow for the puv scale to approach @xmath24 tev .",
    "we describe our setup in the next section .",
    "the ew and collider constraints are discussed in section 3 .",
    "perturbative unitarity in this model is the subject of section 4 and our concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "here , we briefly discuss the modifications induced in our earlier analysis @xcite due to the presence of the @xmath2 and @xmath5 brane terms ; these changes are quite straightforward .",
    "we employ the notation introduced in our previous work . in what follows ,",
    "when we consider the effects of the @xmath2 kinetic term we also include the uv  brane terms associated with the @xmath25 and @xmath26 symmetries in our analysis ; these uv kinetic terms were included in our earlier results . however , for simplicity , we omit the uv terms in our study of the @xmath5 kinetic term .",
    "the introduction of new kinetic terms on the tev brane leads to a shift in the original action ( given in eq.(4 ) of ref.@xcite ) by an amount @xmath27\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath28 being the 5@xmath1 @xmath29 gauge coupling , @xmath30 is the brane separation in the rs model , and @xmath31 are dimensionless parameters which quantify the size of the ir  brane kinetic terms . here",
    "@xmath32 is the field strength tensor for the @xmath2 gauge field , and similarly @xmath33 corresponds to @xmath34 . for later purposes it is convenient to introduce the quantities @xmath35 as in our earlier analysis where @xmath36 is the rs curvature parameter .",
    "we next observe that a non - zero value for @xmath37 will alter the @xmath38 boundary condition @xcite on the tev brane ; instead , we now find @xmath39 , where @xmath40 represents the roots defining the kk spectra , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 represents the @xmath2 gauge field . a similar shift",
    "is observed in the case of the combination of fields associated with the @xmath5 brane term , , @xmath43 .",
    "solving these new boundary conditions leads to alterations of the wavefunction coefficients as well as the eigenvalue equations for the kk tower masses .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the @xmath44 kk tower masses and couplings are left unaltered by a non - zero value of @xmath37 , but are modified by @xmath45 .    in calculating the couplings to both fermions and @xmath44 pairs for the photon ,",
    "the @xmath46 , as well as the rest of the kk tower states , one of the dominant effects due to the new brane terms is the shift in the normalizations of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 wavefunctions .",
    "these normalizations now pick up additional terms ; for the case of the @xmath48 , in comparison to our earlier result ( eq.(50 ) of ref.@xcite ) ; we now obtain : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the wavefunctions for the relevant gauge kk state , and @xmath51 is defined as the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "a similar shift in the @xmath47 normalization also occurs , @xmath53 these new tev brane terms also lead to additional contributions to the normalization of the photon wave function , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a numerical constant which is determined from the boundary conditions and appears in the kk decomposition of the @xmath56 gauge field . due to the abelian nature of the @xmath2 group , new brane term contributions to the",
    "@xmath57 4-point or gauge 3-point functions do not occur .",
    "however , such contributions are induced in the case of the @xmath5 brane term .",
    "our analysis now proceeds by analogy with our earlier work @xcite : we hold @xmath58 as well as the uv  brane kinetic terms @xmath59 fixed and explore the parameter space spanned by the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we previously introduced the three different quantities related to the weak mixing angle : @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is the coupling of the particle we identify as the @xmath57 to the sm fermions ) , and @xmath65 , which is defined at the @xmath46-pole .",
    "all three must take on the same value at the tree - level in the sm .",
    "they can differ significantly in the present scenario ; however , there are preferred parameter space regions , , when @xmath60 is large @xcite , that yield consistent values .",
    "the first question to address here is the variation of @xmath66 with respect to the fixed on - shell value , @xmath67 , as @xmath61 are allowed to change for fixed @xmath60 .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in fig .",

    "we observe that @xmath65 is @xmath37-independent , which we have verified analytically , while @xmath68 increases as @xmath37 increases .",
    "in fact we see that for @xmath69 excellent agreement between the on - shell and effective values is obtained when @xmath70 .",
    "overall , however , the case @xmath71 yields more consistent values , as in our earlier work , due to the large separation between the quantities @xmath72 and @xmath65 when @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , a non - vanishing value of @xmath37 does help to bring the values of the various definitions of @xmath74 into agreement .",
    "in contrast , in the bottom panel we see that as @xmath45 increases both of the different @xmath75 values shrink in size and move away from the on - shell value thus getting further from the sm limit .",

    "the pseudo - oblique parameters are defined in such a way so that they all take on the value zero in the tree level sm .",
    "they are introduced to guide our thinking about the direction in parameter space which approaches the sm .",
    "we note that it is important _ not _ to confuse these pseudo - oblique parameters with the conventionally defined purely oblique @xmath86 . the dependency of @xmath87 on @xmath61 for two different values of @xmath60 is shown in fig .",

    "we see that both @xmath90 and @xmath89 move away from the sm limit with the shifts being much more significant in the case of @xmath73 .",
    "our approach to calculating the pseudo - oblique observables , @xmath91 , differs from that of @xmath92 as calculated by csaki . in our approach",
    ", we numerically fix the masses of the first charged and neutral gauge kk excitations to be those of the physical @xmath57 and @xmath46 bosons observed at colliders .",
    "we use these as input to our analysis , together with the strength of the charged current coupling determined by @xmath93 . from these the couplings and masses of all the gauge kk states can be obtained .",
    "the pseudo - oblique parameters are then defined in terms of observables via the @xmath57 mass , the invisible width of the @xmath46 and the fermionic couplings determined at the @xmath46-pole .",
    "@xmath91 are chosen to vanish at the tree - level in the sm .",

    "the major effect of a non - zero @xmath37 on neutral kk states can be clearly seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ kkspec ] for the case of @xmath73 ; the same qualitative behavior occurs for other values of @xmath60 . here",

    "we take only one ir kinetic term to be non - vanishing at a time.,width=442 ]    one may wonder , since some of the kk states are becoming so light , if there are conflicts with direct searches for new vector bosons at the tevatron as well as with indirect searches such as those for contact interactions at , , lep ii .",
    "we recall that while the tevatron experiments search for new resonances decaying into leptons via drell - yan production , the lep bounds result from searches for deviations in cross sections and angular distributions from sm expectations below production threshold . in the case of the charged kk states , whose",
    "masses are lowered by the @xmath5 brane terms , the best limit comes from the run i search at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the strongest bounds on the direct production of @xmath105-like states come from run ii data using @xmath106pb@xmath107 of integrated luminosity @xcite , while indirect bounds on such states have been supplied by the lepewwg @xcite .",
    "all of these sets of data have been employed in obtaining the results which follow .",
    "figures  [ collbl ] and  [ colldl ] show the @xmath61 dependence of the lightest kk excitation mass for @xmath108 as well as the corresponding bounds on this state from lep ii and the tevatron .",
    "the non - trivial nature of these bounds arises from the modification in the @xmath109 and @xmath100 couplings as @xmath61 are varied .",
    "note that in the case of an @xmath5 [ @xmath2 ] brane term , the best limit from the tevatron arises from constraints on @xmath111 [ @xmath105 ] production .",
    "the reason for this is that , in the case of @xmath5 , both @xmath57 and @xmath46 kk excitations may be light and the tevatron constraints on @xmath111 production are generally stronger than those for @xmath105 production since the cross section times leptonic branching fraction is larger in the @xmath111 case . for both values of @xmath60",
    "we again see that smaller values of @xmath61 are in better agreement with the data .",
    "note that while the tevatron bounds are somewhat sensitive to the assumption that all the sm fermions are localized close to the planck brane due to possible variations in the width of the @xmath109 and @xmath100 , this is _ not _ true for those from lep .",
    "for example , one can imagine that for model building purposes , the right - handed top - quark might be moved away from the planck brane ; this could significantly alter the bounds from the tevatron but those from lep ii would remain intact .    as we will see below , the masses of the first @xmath57 and @xmath46 kk excitations must be relatively light , @xmath113 tev , for there to be any impact on puv .",

    "we will now investigate the question of whether perturbative unitarity is preserved in this model .",
    "as before , we examine the amplitude for the @xmath4 elastic scattering process . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two sum rules were derived that insure the cancellation of terms growing with energy at high energy . here",
    ", we find that , as in our previous analysis , these sum rules are satisfied to good precision once sufficient kk states are included .",
    "however , these sum rules are technically only valid at infinite center of mass energy .",
    "if the scattering occurs at a finite value of @xmath117 , then the amplitude can not receive contributions from states much heavier than @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we investigate the full amplitude in detail in the intermediate energy region , between @xmath118 and the high - energy regime where the sum rules are valid . if unitarity is violated it will be in this region .",
    "since the relevant expansion parameters , @xmath119 , are not small , we use the full tree - level amplitude from ref .",
    "we numerically calculate the couplings using the @xmath61 generalized versions of eq .",
    "( 67 ) from ref .",
    "we then numerically evaluate the amplitude and apply the partial wave unitarity condition @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the zeroth partial wave amplitude .",
    "the couplings were obtained independently on two different computing platforms , maple and mathematica .",
    "the partial wave amplitude was computed independently by three calculations , using mathematica and fortran .",
    "we have included all kk states with masses up to @xmath122 and checked that the results are stable against including more states . for @xmath123",
    "we find that perturbative unitarity is violated and , furthermore , the scale of puv is _ independent _ of @xmath37 . for @xmath124",
    "the violation occurs at @xmath125 ; for @xmath126 it occurs at @xmath127 , close to the sm value .",
    "we have also checked the case @xmath128 which roughly corresponds to the case studied in @xcite ; we found puv at 3.15 tev .",
    "for non - zero @xmath45 , with all other",
    "@xmath129 set to zero , we find that the scale of puv is increased over some of the parameter space , reaching energies @xmath130 tev , as displayed in fig . [ puv ] .",
    "these results can be understood heuristically .",
    "naively , one expects that the unitarity violations will be softened as the masses of the kk states contributing to unitarity restoration are lowered .",
    "hence , one expects that a high value of @xmath37 will at least raise the scale of unitarity violation .",
    "however , note that gauge boson scattering is a fundamentally non - abelian process . in the present model ,",
    "it is therefore an @xmath25 process , and should not depend on the @xmath2 dynamics .",
    "when @xmath37 is turned on , the mass of one state in a pair responds dramatically , while the other is unaffected .",
    "it is clear that the state that responds should be predominantly a hypercharge boson , with very little mixture of @xmath131 in its wavefunction .",
    "indeed , we can write @xcite the couplings of the neutral kk states to sm fermions as @xmath132 .",
    "calculation of the @xmath133 parameters confirms that the light state couples as a hypercharge boson .",
    "numerically , we can look at the coupling of the light state to two @xmath134 bosons . at @xmath116",
    "this coupling is a factor of @xmath135 smaller than that for the next neutral kk state , which is predominantly @xmath131 . as @xmath37",
    "is increased to @xmath136 the couplings of the two states become comparable . however , the light state still makes a negligible contribution to the part of the amplutude responsible for puv . to see this , note that the puv can be traced to incomplete cancellations in the term that grows linearly with s at high energies .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath36th state to this sum rule is proportional to @xmath137 , so the light state has little effect . in the case where @xmath45 is non - vanishing",
    ", it is the other member of the degenerate kk pair whose mass is lowered . in this case , the light state then couples mostly to isospin , and is capable of significantly modifying the @xmath21 scattering amplitude .     scattering as a function of the kinetic terms .",
    "we take @xmath73.,width=442 ]    a note about numerical instabilities is in order .",
    "we find that the sum rule governing the coefficient of the @xmath138 term is satisfied at the level of @xmath139 after the first kk state is included , while the sum rule for the @xmath140 term is satisfied to the level of @xmath141 .",
    "after a few more states are included , the first sum rule is satisfied to @xmath142 , and the second to @xmath143 .",
    "this demonstrates that the puv is due to incomplete cancellations in the term growing like @xmath140 , as well as the presence of the constant term .",
    "however , consider the case where there is a numerical instability in the calculation of the couplings at the @xmath144 level .",
    "then we can estimate the energy scale at which this becomes important by noting that the amplitude goes like @xmath145 .",
    "this becomes of order unity when @xmath146 , implying that a calculation good to only 8 digits will give incorrect results when the scale of puv is in the few @xmath147 range .",
    "since unitarity depends on delicate cancellations , it could be expected that any error will decrease the scale of puv .",
    "however , we have , somewhat surprisingly , found that this is _ not _ necessarily true .",
    "the reason is that the terms growing like @xmath140 and @xmath138 have the opposite sign .",
    "a numerical error can thus cause the @xmath138 term to turn on prematurely and cancel the contribution from the @xmath140 term , leading to an apparent scale of puv _ higher _ than it actually is .",
    "for example , we studied one case where a numerical error at the level of @xmath144 caused the apparent scale of puv to be @xmath148 , while the correct scale was actually @xmath149 . for this reason ,",
    "all our results were computed independently on two platforms , with agreement to greater than 12 digits .",
    "the warped higgsless model , which breaks the electroweak symmetry via boundary conditions associated with an extra dimension , offers a promising alternative to the higgs mechanism .",
    "a custodial @xmath5 symmetry is present in the model , so that reasonable agreement with precision electroweak data is conceivable .",
    "however , the degree of such agreement varies as the parameter space of the model is explored , and some regions can be excluded . here",
    ", we examined the effects of including ir(tev)brane kinetic brane terms associated with the @xmath2 and @xmath5 gauge symmetries of the model .",
    "we found that the addition of the @xmath2 kinetic term enhances the agreement with the tree - level sm electroweak relations , particularly for larger values of the ratio of the 5@xmath1 couplings @xmath150 , with reasonable values of the brane term parameter @xmath37 .",
    "however , including the @xmath5 brane term alone results in a stark disagreement with the sm tree level relations in the electroweak sector .",
    "we performed a limited exploration of the full parameter space and found it is possible that a combination of the two ir  brane terms may result in a reasonable consistency with the tree - level sm relations .    in its original form",
    ", the whm has some difficulties in the gauge sector in that perturbative unitarity is violated at the tev - scale in @xmath21 scattering .",
    "this does not exclude the model from being viable , but does suggest that interactions in the gauge sector are problematic . to restore unitarity in the gauge sector , additional new physics must be introduced . here , we again examined the effects of including the ir(tev)brane kinetic brane terms .",
    "it is well - known that the addition of brane terms can alter the couplings and masses of gauge kk states , and this would thus affect the kk contributions to @xmath21 scattering .",
    "while we found that the @xmath2 brane term does modify the gauge kk spectrum , we also discovered that puv in @xmath21 scattering is independent of such a brane term and hence remains unaffected by its presence .",
    "this is because this scattering process is inherently non - abelian and should not depend on the @xmath2 dynamics .",
    "in contrast , the inclusion of the @xmath5 kinetic term does affect @xmath21 scattering ; for moderate values of the brane term , violation of perturbative unitarity is delayed until @xmath151 tev . in addition , we also investigated the collider bounds on the production of the lightest gauge kk excitation as a function of the brane terms .",
    "searches for new gauge bosons at the tevatron and lep ii exclude large values of the kinetic term parameters @xmath61 .",
    "our analysis shows how various directions in the parameter space of the whm affect its phenomenology .",
    "requiring a model that is perturbatively sensible up to @xmath152 tev favors @xmath73 and @xmath153 , regardless of the size of @xmath37 .",
    "collider constraints on the kk modes of the gauge bosons can accommodate this range of parameters , as long as @xmath154 , with the tevatron bounds depending on the fermion localization .",
    "we observe that the requirements of multi - tev perturbative unitarity and those imposed by tree level sm relations , as represented by the pseudo - oblique parameters and various values of @xmath75 , do not coexist without tension in this model .",
    "however , a direct comparison of these latter quantities with the electroweak data requires a computation of the radiative corrections in the whm , which lies outside the scope of this work .",
    "thus , it remains an open possibility that this model could provide a viable alternative for electroweak symmetry breaking , valid far above the weak scale .",
    "we would like to thank csabi csaki , graham kribs , hitoshi murayama , and john terning for discussions related to this work .",
