    "the calculation of the multiloop integrals is important for the applications of the perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "a number of the calculational methods has been developed for this purpose .",
    "they roughly fall in to two categories : direct and indirect methods .",
    "the former include feynman parameterization technique , mellin - barnes representation method , gegenbauer polynomials expansion in coordinate space .",
    "the latter methods make use of the equations which are satisfied by the integrals .",
    "the construction of these equations relies on the possibility to make the ibp reduction of the integrals under consideration to some finite set of the integrals , called `` master integrals '' . using this technique one can derive the differential equation for the integrals with several scales , or difference equation for the integrals with one scale .",
    "these equations determine the integrals up to the solution of their homogeneous parts .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a method of multiloop integrals evaluation based on @xmath0 recurrence relations @xcite and @xmath0-analyticity was suggested ( dra method ) . since then it was applied to the calculation of various complicated integrals @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we review this method .",
    "assume that we are interested in the calculation of the @xmath1-loop integral depending on @xmath2 linearly independent external momenta @xmath3 .",
    "there are @xmath4 scalar products depending on the loop momenta @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the loop integral has the form@xmath10 where the scalar functions @xmath11 are linear polynomials with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "the functions @xmath11 are assumed to be linearly independent and to form a complete basis in the sense that any non - zero linear combination of them depends on the loop momenta , and any @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of @xmath11 .    the integral @xmath13 can be considered as a value of function of integer @xmath14-dimensional vector @xmath15 .",
    "the set of points in @xmath16 ( and the corresponding set of integrals ) , having the same set of positive coordinates , form a _",
    "sector_. thus the whole space is split into @xmath17 different sectors which can be conveniently labeled by their simplest elements .",
    "e.g. , @xmath18 denotes the sector in which all points have exactly two first coordinates positive .",
    "the points ( and the corresponding integrals ) in @xmath16 and the sectors form a partially ordered set with respect to the following relation .",
    "we say that the point @xmath19 is _ simpler _ than the point @xmath20 iff all coordinates , positive in @xmath19 , are also positive in @xmath20 , but not vice versa .",
    "it is convenient @xcite to introduce the operators @xmath21 which act on such functions as @xmath22 these operators respect the notion of sectors in a sense that the values of functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the point of some sector are expressed via the values of function @xmath25 in the same or simpler sectors . using these operators",
    ", we can express the integral in @xmath26 dimensions via the integrals in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite : @xmath27   ^{-1}}{\\left ( \\mathcal{d}-e - l+1\\right )   _ { l } } p\\left (   b_{1},\\ldots , b_{n}\\right )   j^{\\left (   \\mathcal{d}\\right )   } \\left (   \\mathbf{n}\\right)\\ , , \\label{eq : lowering}\\\\ j^{\\left (   \\mathcal{d}-2\\right )   } \\left (   \\mathbf{n}\\right ) & = ( \\mu/2)^{l}q\\left (   a_{1},\\ldots , a_{n}\\right)j^{\\left (   \\mathcal{d}\\right )   }   \\left (   \\mathbf{n}\\right)\\ , , \\label{eq : raising}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 for the euclidean / pseudoeuclidean case , and polynomials @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined as @xmath31 these relations are the most useful when the integral in the left - hand side is master .",
    "then , making the ibp reduction of the right - hand side of eqs .",
    ", , one obtains difference equations for the master integrals . after this",
    ", we obtain a linear combination of the integrals of the same , or simpler , sectors as the integral in the left - hand side of eqs . , .",
    "we assume that the integrals of the the simpler sectors are already known at this stage , either by the same , or by some other method .",
    "the ibp reduction makes eqs . , equivalent , so in what follows we consider only the lowering dimensional recurrence relation , obtained from eq .",
    "we also change notations , writing @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "if a sector of the integral in the left - hand side contains only one master integral , the general form of the equation is the following : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is some rational function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a non - homogeneous part constructed of the simpler master integrals in @xmath38 dimensions .",
    "if a sector contains several master integrals , it is convenient to consider them as a column - vector integral @xmath39 and to write the equations for them in a matrix form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some rational matrix ( i.e. , the matrix with coefficients being rational functions of @xmath36 ) .      in order to write the general solution of this equation ,",
    "we introduce the notion of indefinite sum and indefinite product . given the function @xmath42 , the _ indefinite sum _",
    "@xmath43 is any function , satisfying the relation @xmath44 the indefinite sum @xmath43 is defined up to the addition of arbitrary periodic function of @xmath36 . if the function @xmath42 decreases faster than @xmath45 when @xmath46 and/or @xmath47 , one can write @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 where @xmath50 is arbitrary periodic function .    the _ indefinite product",
    "_ @xmath51 is any function , satisfying the relation @xmath52 @xmath51 is defined up to the multiplication by arbitrary periodic function of @xmath36 .",
    "note that for any rational function @xmath42 one can express @xmath53 as a product of @xmath54-functions multiplied by arbitrary periodic function , see ref .",
    "we will determine the indefinite product @xmath55 also for the matrix functions @xmath56 as a matrix function , satisfying the relation @xmath57 obviously , this defines @xmath58 up to the multiplication from the right by arbitrary periodic matrix .    in these notations",
    "one can write down the general solution of eq . in the form @xmath59",
    "where @xmath60^{-1}$ ] is called a _ summing factor_. if the summand in eq .",
    "decreases faster than @xmath45 when @xmath46 and/or @xmath47 , one can use eqs .",
    ", to write @xmath61 note that the second term in the right - hand side is invariant with respect to the choice of the summing factor .",
    "thus , in order to find the integral , we need to fix the function @xmath62 for any choice of the summing factor . here we note the essential difference between the general solutions of _ differential _ and _ difference _ equations .",
    "the homogeneous part of the general solution of the differential equation is parameterized by finite number of constants , while the homogeneous part of the general solution of the difference equation is parameterized by the periodic function(s ) .",
    "while fixing the finite number of constants is a relatively simple task , fixing the periodic function may be quite difficult .",
    "the key point of the dra approach is the usage of the analytical properties of the integral in order to fix this function .",
    "let us rewrite eq . as @xmath63 suppose that we can show that the right - hand side of this equation is a meromorphic function of @xmath64 in the riemann sphere .",
    "then @xmath62 is determined , up to a constant , by the principal parts of its laurent series around singular points .",
    "the analysis of the analytical properties of the right - hand side of eq . can be performed in any vertical stripe of unit length in the complex plane of @xmath36 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 . there is no cut on the ray @xmath65 because the right - hand side is necessarily a periodic function of @xmath36 .",
    "the proper choice of this stripe ( _ basic stripe _ ) can simplify the evaluation of the integral .",

    "here we are interested instead in the analytical properties of the integral as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "it appears that the latter properties are much simpler than the former .",
    "let us consider the parametric representation of some @xmath1-loop integral in euclidean space with @xmath68 internal lines ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "it is important only that both these functions are nonnegative in the whole integration region,@xmath72 suppose that the parametric representation converges for all @xmath36 in some interval @xmath73 .",
    "then it is easy to see that it converges on the whole stripe @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , we can estimate @xmath75 therefore , eq . determines @xmath76 as a holomorphic function on the whole stripe @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite a more general fact was proved : the representation determines the meromorphic function on the whole complex @xmath36-plane .",
    "the determination of poles position can be automatized thanks to ` fiesta ` @xcite .    as @xmath78 tends to @xmath79 while @xmath80 is fixed , eq .",
    "shows that @xmath81 thus , the parametric representation can be used for the determination of the analytical properties of the first term in the right - hand side of eq . .",
    "since the second term in the right - hand side of eq",
    ". is constructed of the integrals already known at this stage , we , indeed , can determine the position of the poles of function @xmath82 .          in order to demonstrate how the representations obtained within the dra method can be treated numerically ,",
    "let us consider the three - loop master integrals depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : masters ] . direct application of the dra method gives the following results : @xmath83    the above results for the integrals @xmath84 and @xmath85 contain repeated sums of the form : @xmath86    from the viewpoint of numerical calculation , it is important that the dependence on the summation variables is factorized in the summand .",
    "we note that it is not the case for the mellin - barnes multiple sums .",
    "let us show that the calculation of such factorized sums can be performed without nested loops .",
    "indeed , let us define @xmath87 sequences @xmath88 as follows : @xmath89 it is easy to check that the last sequence , @xmath90 , converges to @xmath91 .",
    "obviously , the iterative calculation of these quantities can be organized in one loop .",
    "therefore , the complexity of the numerical calculation grows moderately with the complexity level of the integrals .",
    "the dependence of the calculation time on the order of the expansion , required precision , and complexity level of the integrals is shown in fig . [",
