    "cvs with accretion disks are classified into dwarf novae ( dne ) , which show outbursts with amplitudes of 28 mag , and novalikes , which do not show strong outbursts .",
    "the distinction between these systems are believed to be a result of the thermal instability in the accretion disk , and novalike variables are regarded as systems having higher mass - transfer rates than in dne , resulting in thermally stable accretion disks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "superhumps are variations whose periods are longer ( these superhumps are therefore also called positive superhumps ) than the orbital period by a few percent , and are observed during superoutbursts of su uma - type dwarf novae ( a class of dwarf novae ) and in some novalike variables ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . these superhumps are believed to arise from the precessing non - axisymmetric disk whose eccentricity is produced by the tidal instability arising from the 3:1 resonance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the fractional superhump excess ( @xmath1 in period and @xmath2 in frequency , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the superhump period and the orbital period , respectively ) is an observational measure of the precession rate of the accretion disk . if we treat the precessing disk dynamically , and ignore hydrodynamical effects , @xmath5 is shown to has a form @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass ratio of the binary , @xmath8 @xmath9 are the precessional and orbital angular velocity , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the disk radius and the binary separation , respectively .",

    "( 88mm,110mm)fig6.eps      we here introduce a new method to calculate two - dimensional power spectra using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso , @xcite ) , which was introduced to analysis of astronomical time - series data @xcite .",
    "in fourier - type period analysis , there is the well - known heisenberg - gabor limit , that is , one can not simultaneously localize a signal in both the time domain and the frequency domain ; this characteristic of fourier - type period analysis is disadvantageous to the analysis of such rapidly changing periods , as superhumps in outbursting dwarf novae have .",
    "the advantage of the lasso analysis is that this method is not restricted by the heisenberg - gabor limit and the peaks in the power spectra are very sharp .",
    "there is , however , a set - back of this method that the resultant power is not linear in power amplitude .",
    "it is very advantageous to use the lasso period analysis in resolving closely spaced signals when we know that only a small number of signals coexist .",
    "lasso gives very sharp signals in the two - dimensional power spectra , and thus it is suitable for studying the signals with rapidly varying frequency , such as superhumps in outbursting su uma - type dwarf novae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the power spectra were estimated obtained by applying the method of @xcite to 10  d bins , which were shifted in a step of 1  d after removing the long - term trend using locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess , @xcite ) .",
    "the 200 frequencies were evenly spaced between frequencies 7.69 and 9.52 c / d to extract the spectra .",

    "r sct for @xcite ) .",
    "we also applied smearing of the signals between @xmath223 bins shifted in a step of 1  d while considering the width of the window .",
    "the resultant spectrum is shown in figures [ fig : j1924lassopowlc ] and [ fig : j1924lassopowlc2 ] .",
    "the latter figure also shows a comparison between lasso and fourier analyses .",
    "a similar analysis to the sc data yielded a similar result with a better time - resolution .",
    "since there was no additional remarkable feature in the analysis of the sc data , we omitted this figure .",
    "although it is not clear which orbital phase corresponds to the optical maximum of the orbital variation , it can be the phase of the the superior conjunction of the secondary if the maximum represents the reflection effect .",
    "we therefore define here the orbital phase of the optical maximuma as 0.5 to make a comparison with eclipsing sw sex stars .",
    "the spectroscopic zero phase ( red - to - blue crossing of the velocities of the emission lines ) @xmath23 = 24454734.66646(383 ) @xcite corresponds to an orbital phase of 0.20 ( the accumulative error of the phase resulting from the error in the period is smaller than 0.04 even assuming an extreme error of 10@xmath24  d ) .",

    "it has been shown that the precession frequency is a sum of the dynamical term , the pressure effect ( or an effect of a finite thickness of the disk ) producing the retrograde precession and a minor wave - wave interaction term @xcite .",
    "since the variation of the observed superhump period very exactly traced the variation of the system brightness , we suggest that the pressure effect is responsible for the variation of the period .",
    "this pressure effect is an increasing function of the sound velocity at the edge of the disk ( @xmath43 ; @xcite ) , which has a dependence of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the temperature of the midplane of the disk .",

    "although this value is smaller than the observed one , this discrepancy might be resolved if the actual disk in a novalike variable in a slightly low state may have a deviation from the steady standard accretion disk .",
    "the importance of the pressure effect may be partly attributed to the inferred high mass - transfer rates in sw sex stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . since most of the permanent superhumpers are sw sex stars , this might result a systematic bias if we calibrate the @xmath30 relation using both dwarf novae and permanent superhumpers .",
    "following this logic that the period variation of the superhumps can be attributed to the pressure effect , we assumed that the largest @xmath5 was recorded when the disk had the oscillation wave limited to the edge of the accretion disk ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) .",
    "the precession rate can be expressed as the following equation @xcite : @xmath52 , \\label{equ : presfreq}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is @xmath54 which is the laplace coefficient of the order 0 in celestial mechanics @xcite . numerically calculating this function assuming a radius of the 3:1 resonance of @xmath55",

    "during the q14 run , weak signals of negative superhumps appeared to be present around frequencies of 9.29.3 c / d ( figure [ fig : j1924lassopowlc3 ] ) .",

    "this assumption may be tested by future kepler observations , especially if sc runs are available .",
    "these negative superhumps were not detected in other quarters .",
    "the frequency of negative superhump varied as in the same manner as that of positive superhuumps ; the frequency became smaller when the system slightly faded at around bjd 24551602455170 ( frequency 9.25 c / d , period 0.1081  d , @xmath57% ) compared to the brighter state around bjd 24561252456140 ( frequency 9.34 c / d , period 0.1071  d , @xmath58% ) .",
    "the variation followed a very similar pattern to that of positive superhumps .",
    "since the pressure effect is not expected to work for producing negative superhumps ( @xcite ; see also more detailed discussion in @xcite ) , we can attribute this frequency variation to the change in the radius of the disk .",
    "since @xmath5 has a dependence of @xmath59 @xcite , this variation of @xmath5 corresponds to a variation of 11% in the radius of the accretion disk .",

    "<S> we analyzed a kepler light curve of kic 8751494 , a recently recognized novalike cataclysmic variable in the kepler field . </S>",
    "<S> we detected a stable periodicity of 0.114379(1 )  d , which we identified as being the binary s orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> the stronger photometric period around 0.12245 d , which had been detected from the ground - based observation , was found to be variable , and we identified this period as being the positive superhump period . </S>",
    "<S> this superhump period showed short - term ( 1020  d ) and strong variations in period most unexpectedly when the object entered a slightly faint state . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional superhump excess varied as large as @xmath030% . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the period very well traced the variation of the brightness of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the time - scales of this variation of the superhump period was too slow to be interpreted as the variation caused by the change in the disk radius due to the thermal disk instability . </S>",
    "<S> we interpreted that the period variation was caused by the varying pressure effect on the period of positive superhumps . </S>",
    "<S> this finding suggests that the pressure effect , in at least novalike systems , plays a very important ( up to @xmath030% in the precession rate ) role in producing the period of the positive superhumps . </S>",
    "<S> we also described a possible detection of the negative superhumps with a varying period of 0.10710.1081  d in the q14 run of the kepler data , and found that the variation of the frequency of the negative superhumps followed that of positive superhumps . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the fractional superhump excesses of negative and positive superhumps can be understood if the angular frequency of the positive superhumps is decreased by a pressure effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the phase of the velocity variation of the emission lines reported in the earlier study is compatible with the sw sex - type classification . </S>",
    "<S> further , we introduced a new two - dimentional period analysis using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) and showed superior advantage of this method . </S>"
