    "proteins is the common name of the complex macro molecules which are formed by gathering of a great number amino - acids and which play unremitting roles in the life times of all of the living creatures .",
    "there are approximately twenty different amino - acids which take place in the structure of the proteins and which are chain molecules .",
    "the order or arrangement of this twenty units is sensitive and definite .",
    "this order , determines the nature of the protein and as a result identifies its function @xcite . each protein molecule is formed by on original combination and consecutive placing of different numbers of amino - acids .",
    "proteins under their own natural physiological conditions , spontaneously open out from one dimensional structures to three dimensional structures in the time intervals starting from milliseconds and getting to minutes .",
    "the three dimensional structures of the proteins depend on various environmental factors in the cell .",
    "unfolded proteins return to their natural states when the environmental factors are removed exhibiting the feature that the three dimensional structure of a protein solely depends on its amino - acid ordering information .",
    "this situation gives the hope to some research workers that protein folding could be reconstructed by computer simulation @xcite .",
    "but the difficulty of this simulation even for small proteins is in view .    in this study ,",
    "the model belonging to the proteins is presented in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the thermodynamical quantities concerning the variation of the increments of additional enthalpy @xmath0 and gibbs energy @xmath1 with respect to temperature have been expressed and these parameters are related to the parameters of the proteins with the help of statistical thermodynamics . at the end , from the curves belonging to the increments of enthalpy and gibbs energy ,",
    "the conclusions relevant to the structures of the proteins are presented .",
    "a simple model of protein unfolding has been developed by bakk @xcite .",
    "bakk has started the model by choosing the water molecules as classical electric dipoles .",
    "he has demanded that non polar dissolution should include important physical properties in order to model the effect on the folding of the proteins . in the model",
    "used , in the medium of the formed electric field , the folding and unfolding of the proteins have been taken as the basis . here ,",
    "the electric field is not an external field but has been used in the modelling of the ice - like behavior exhibited by the water molecules around the non polar surfaces .",
    "the electric field is a result of the effective behavior of the non polar dissolvent applied to the protein unfolding .",
    "the modified partition function of the protein system could be taken as @xcite : @xmath9 .\\ ] ]    here , @xmath10 represents the chemical potential and the term @xmath11 corresponding to the ph of the system has been introduced to the partition function .",
    "@xmath12 indicates single particle partition function . where effective energy is given by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand average dipole moment has the form @xmath14 .",
    "taking electric field @xmath2 and total dipole moment @xmath3 as thermodynamical variables , the first law of thermodynamics could be written for the proteins in the form : @xmath15    in this case , change in the enthalpy is ; @xmath16    enthalpy and entropy increments could also be written by taking the total differentials of enthalpy @xmath17 and entropy @xmath18 which leads to : @xmath19 @xmath20    after substituting eq.(4 ) and eq.(5 ) in eq.(3 ) @xmath21 dm\\ ] ] has been obtained .",
    "writing down the expressions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq.(6 ) and then integrating one could get for the enthalpy increment : @xmath25 dm.\\ ] ]    using the first law of thermodynamics for the proteins which has been given by eq.(2 ) , change in the gibbs energy @xmath26 could be written down . with a similar approach , taking the total differentials of the gibbs energy @xmath27 and total dipole moment @xmath28 and then substituting then in eq.(8 ) together with the expressions @xmath29 and @xmath30 leads after integration to the expression which gives the gibbs energy increment : @xmath31    the free energy of the system has been obtained from the relation @xmath32 giving : @xmath33    the thermodynamical quantities of the system has been determined using the entropy relation @xmath34 which in turn leads to : @xmath35    the total dipole moment has been calculated from the expression @xmath36 resulting in the following : @xmath37    the energy of the system is given by @xmath38 and when the partition function is substituted one obtains : @xmath39    additional heat capacity at effective field has been calculated by making use of the equation @xmath40 which gives : @xmath41    using the expression @xmath42 ^ 2 $ ] which has been obtained for additional heat capacity at constant total dipole moment ; @xmath43 \\sinh(\\beta \\epsilon_e)- \\\\ \\nonumber     \\frac{k^2 \\beta^2}{(-2 \\beta \\epsilon_e \\cosh(\\beta \\epsilon_e)+      ( 2 + \\beta^2 \\epsilon_e^2 ) \\sinh(\\beta \\epsilon_e))}\\times [ \\epsilon_e \\beta ( 4 \\beta b m^2- 2 \\beta \\mu ) \\cosh(\\beta \\epsilon_e)- \\\\       ( 4 + \\beta ( b m^2 + 2\\beta \\epsilon_e- 2 \\mu))\\sinh(\\beta \\epsilon_e)]^2 \\ } \\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has been calculated .",
    "another quantity @xmath44 when calculated gives : @xmath45 when eq.(15 ) and eq.(16 ) are substituted in eq.(7 ) , after integration gives for the enthalpy increment :    @xmath46 + t exp(\\frac{b m^2 t+ t_t \\mu}{2 k t_t t})\\times   \\\\ \\nonumber [ -2 \\epsilon_e ( b m+ \\epsilon- k \\epsilon+ ( k- 1 ) \\epsilon_e ) \\cosh(\\frac{\\epsilon_e}{k t})+ k ( -2 ( k- 1 ) t ( \\epsilon- \\epsilon_e)+ \\\\   b m ( 2 t+ m \\epsilon_e)- 2 \\epsilon_e \\mu ) \\sinh(\\frac{\\epsilon_e}{k t})]\\ \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , substituting eq.(11 ) into eq.(9 ) , after integration and writing down eq.(12 ) in this expression , one obtains for the gibbs energy increment : @xmath47-   \\\\    \\{t exp(\\frac{\\frac{b m^2}{t_t}+ \\frac{2 \\mu}{t}}{2 k})\\times [ -\\epsilon \\epsilon_e \\cosh(\\frac{\\epsilon_e}{k t})+ k t(\\epsilon + \\epsilon_e ) \\sinh(\\frac{\\epsilon_e}{k t_t } ) ] \\",
    "\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now the numerical applications of the enthalpy and gibbs energy increments will be taken under consideration . the unfolding and then folding of the protein molecules take place by a thermodynamical mechanism .",
    "in other words , the original structures of the macromolecules are determined thermodynamically . in the following figures ,",
    "dashed lines represent experimental study where as solid lines theoretical results .",
    "the physical quantities @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath10 of the graphs which have been obtained in this semi phenomenological theory are determined by fitting to the experimental results of privalov . in figs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) the variations of the thermodynamical functions enthalpy and gibbs energy increments with respect to temperature are represented for two of the selected proteins .",
    "yellow ( belonging to myoglobin ) and red ( belonging to ribonuclease ) solid lines indicate the variations with respect to temperature of increments of the thermodynamical quantities which have been obtained theoretically .",
    "the enthalpy increments @xmath0 between the folding and unfolding states , has a negative value in the cold folding region .",
    "this behavior shows that cold folding has been realized by giving heat out and this is negative heat capacity , on the other hand in the @xmath50 case the system is in the warm folding region and the heat capacity is positive .    the greatest contribution to the natural structure",
    "are provided by hydrophobic interactions . in an unfolding chain structure ,",
    "hydrophobic amino - acid side chains are unfolded by a regular water molecule lattice and the entropy of the system decreases .",
    "but when the chain undergoes folding and hydrophobic side chains are collected at intermolecular regions by getting a way from water , the regular water molecules will be free and as increase in the total entropy of the system takes place .    in each protein molecule",
    "@xmath1 gibbs potential increment , is a fraction of the quantity @xmath51 in the folding and unfolding states at each degrees of freedom and @xmath1 gibbs potential increment is not a monotonic function of temperature .",
    "gibbs free energy increment between the folding and unfolding states has a maximum that is @xmath52 and thus the unfolded form is stable and at both sides of this maximum this increment becomes negative .",
    "this means that two transitions take place .",
    "one of them is the unfolding of the proteins at high temperature where as the other is the folding of the proteins at low temperature .",
    "this phenomenon is known as cold denaturation in other words cold unfolding . as a result ,",
    "in the cold denaturation transition hidden heat is negative and just opposite to this in the warm denaturation transition hidden heat has a positive value .    during the folding of the protein entropy increases that is to say in returning to the original structure of the protein it is not preferred from the point of view of energy .",
    "therefore there must be some factors which oppose the increase in entropy ( i.e. folding ) and encourage on the other hand the folding of the molecules .",
    "since covalent structure is conserved during unfolding , forces which oppose the unfolding of the protein could not be covalent interactions .",
    "transformation of the non polar molecules into water becomes with a considerable decrease in entropy .",
    "the entropy of hydration of those non polar groups must be temperature dependent since hydration leads to an important increase in the heat capacity .",
    "the same thing is expected for the enthalpy of hydration . in fact , if we look at the not hydration effect during the transition of the non polar components from gas phase to water we observe that both enthalpy and entropy are negative and the magnitudes decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "hance , one could consider that the hydration effect is responsible from the dissolution of the non polar compounds in water .",
