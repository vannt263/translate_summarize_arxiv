    "the emergence of unexpected new properties has made the physics of interface an active research area for some time now@xcite .",
    "the interface of a band insulator and mott insulator was shown to have metallic properties@xcite , which becomes superconducting on lowering the temperature@xcite .",
    "theoretically the subject has been studied using different methods like restricted hartree fock@xcite , two site dmft@xcite , single site dmft @xcite and lancsoz @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we have studied a metal - quasi 2d barrier - metal heterostructure .",
    "the barrier planes are described by the ionic hubbard model , which describes a band insulator with onsite correlation .",
    "thus the barrier planes describe a band insulator in the absence of correlation @xmath0 , and a mott insulator in the absence of chemical modulation for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 depends on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the ionic hubbard model has been widely studied by various groups using various techniques like single site dmft@xcite , quantum monte carlo@xcite and cluster dmft @xcite in 2d , dmrg in 1d@xcite and two site dmft in quasi 2d @xcite . at half filling a single site dmft solution which assumes a paramagnetic solution yields a metallic phase which separates the mott insulator and band insulator phases@xcite . a solution which incorporates long range anti - ferromagnetic ordering in quasi 2d , using two site dmft",
    ", however shows that the system is insulating for all interaction strengths .",
    "the mott insulator - band insulator heterostructure has been studied using restricted hartree fock @xcite , inhomogeneous two site dmft @xcite and in quasi one dimensional lattices using lancsoz method @xcite .",
    "the metal - mott insulator - metal heterostructure has been studied @xcite while the role of disorder on the mott planes has also been investigated by us @xcite .",
    "spatial variations in the planes and along the z direction play a crucial role in determining the correct ground state of a highly inhomogeneous systems like heterostructures .",
    "the in plane variation is totally ignored in a one site inhomogeneous dmft(idmft)@xcite approach .",
    "the two site idmft method though capable of capturing planar long range order like planar antiferromagnetism , is insufficient to capture the regime where the two orders start to cancel each other leading to short range ordering . with this in mind we have adopted the method of unrestricted hartree fock . the hartree fock method has been used successfully to describe the ground state of the ionic hubbard model even in 1d and was shown to be in excellent agreement with real space rg calculation@xcite .",

    "the operator @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron of spin @xmath8 at site @xmath5 on the plane @xmath4 .",
    "we set the in - plane hopping @xmath9 to be nearest neighbor only , and equal to @xmath10 , the hopping between planes , so that the lattice structure is that of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we take @xmath11 for the @xmath12 sites and @xmath13 for the @xmath14 sites .",
    "we also take @xmath15 for the barrier planes , and zero for the metallic planes .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath16 is calculated by taking the average of the n/2 th and the n/2 + 1 th energy level .",
    "the plane index @xmath17 correspond to the metallic layers .",
    "all the other @xmath4 values in between correspond to the barrier planes . for the quasi 2d geometry taken by us total number of sites @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total number of layers and @xmath20 is the number of sites in the planes .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figs 4a , b , c , d show the plots of optical conductivity versus @xmath21 for @xmath0 = 1,3,6 and 7 respectively for @xmath22 = 1 . as we tune @xmath0 keeping @xmath22 fixed , the system exhibits reentrant behaviour in the form of an insulator - metal - insulator transition . as the gap at half filling",
    "gets killed initially around @xmath0 = 1 , a residual slightly weakened cdw ordering persists in the system all the way upto @xmath0 = 6 .",
    "the a sites in the barrier start to deplete and the b sites are relatively unaffected for low @xmath0 .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 further , the system becomes a metal as seen in @xmath0 = 3 and 6 .",
    "the metal at @xmath0 = 3 is a much weaker one compared to the one at @xmath0 = 6 , as the charge ordering is fully destroyed for @xmath0 = 6 .",
    "the weak metallic behaviour for @xmath0 = 3 inspite of the presence of charge ordering in the system is a consequence of weak tunneling of electrons between the sites . for @xmath0 = 7 ,",
    "a small inhomogeneous spin order develops in the system , which drives the system to an insulating phase .",
    "a barrier described by the ionic hubbard model sandwiched between two metallic planes has been studied using unrestricted hartree fock .",
    "increasing the strength of the site potential modulation , beyond a critical strength @xmath23 opens a new gap away from half filling at a value that depends on the sign of the modulation .",
    "below @xmath23 onset of correlation reduces the gap to zero gradually . above @xmath23",
    "while the gap at half filling follows the same pattern , the new gap shows non monotonic behaviour with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the system shows reentrant insulator - metal - insulator transition with increasing @xmath0 for fixed @xmath22 = 1 .",
    "spin asymmetric behaviour is noticed when both charge and spin order is present in the system .",
