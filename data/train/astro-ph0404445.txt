    "clusters of galaxies are of great interest both as cosmological probes and as `` laboratories '' for studying galaxy formation . the mass function and number density of galaxy clusters as a function of redshift is a powerful diagnostic for the determination of cosmological parameters ( see voit 2004 for a recent comprehensive review ) .",
    "besides , clusters represent higher than average concentrations of galaxies , with active interaction and exchange of material between them and their environment , as testified by the non - primordial composition of the hot surrounding gas ( e.g.matteucci & vettolani 1988 ; arnaud _ et  al . _  1992",
    "; renzini _ et  al . _  1993",
    "; finoguenov _ et  al . _  2000 , 2001",
    "; de grandi _ et  al . _  2004",
    "; baumgartner _",
    "et  al . _",
    "there are observational and theoretical arguments indicating that clusters are not fair samples of the average global properties of the universe : the morphological mixture of galaxies in clusters is significantly skewed toward earlier types with respect to the field population , implying star formation histories peaking at higher redshifts than is typical in the field ( dressler 1980 ; goto _ et  al . _  2003",
    "; kodama & bower 2001 ; see also section  3 ) ; this is qualitatively in line with the expectation that high density regions such as clusters , in a hierarchical bottom  up cosmological scenario , evolve at an `` accelerated '' pace with respect to the rest of the universe ( bower 1991 ; diaferio _ et  al . _  2001 ;",
    "et  al . _",
    "although clusters are somewhat biased sites of galaxy formation , they present the advantage of being bound structures with deep potential wells , likely to retain all the matter that falls within their gravitational influence ; henceforth , they represent well - defined , self  contained `` pools '' , where one can aim at keeping full track of the process of galaxy formation and evolution , and of the global interplay between galaxies and their environment .",
    "the physics of clusters of galaxies has thus received increasing attention in the past decade , benefiting from a number of x  ray missions measuring the emission of the hot intra ",
    "cluster gas ( e.g. , _ asca , rosat , xmm , chandra _ ) as well as from extensive optical / nir surveys probing the distribution of galaxies and their properties ( e.g.  morphs , sdss , 2mass ) .",
    "understanding cluster physics is also crucial to reconstruct , from the observed x ",
    "ray luminosity function and temperature distribution , the intrinsic mass function of clusters as a function of redshift , which is a quantity of profound cosmological interest ( voit 2004 ) .",
    "the baryonic mass in clusters is largely in the form of a hot intra ",
    "cluster medium ( icm ) , which dominates by a factor of 510 over the stellar mass ( arnaud _ et  al . _  1992",
    "; lin , mohr & stanford 2003 ) . consequently , early theoretical work and numerical simulations concentrated on pure gas dynamics when modelling clusters .",
    "recently however , attention has focused also on the role of galaxy and star formation , and related effects .",
    "star formation locks  up low entropy gas , and supplies thermal and kinetic energy to the surrounding medium via supernova explosion and shell expansion ; both processes likely contribute to the observed `` entropy floor '' in low ",
    "mass clusters , and the corresponding breaking of the scaling relations expected from pure gravitational collapse physics ( voit _ et  al . _",
    "2003 ) . besides",
    ", star formation is accompanied by the production of new metals and the chemical enrichment of the environment ; the considerable ( about 1/3 solar ) metallicity of the icm indicates that a significant fraction of the metals produced  comparable or even larger than the fraction remaining within the galaxies  is dispersed into the intergalactic medium ( renzini 2004 ) , affecting the cooling rates of the intra ",
    "cluster gas .",
    "it is thus clear that the hydrodynamical evolution of the hot icm is intimately connected to the formation and evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "only recently , however , due to advances in computing capabilities as well as in detailed physical modelling , cluster simulations have reached a level of sophistication adequate to trace star formation and related effects in individual galaxies , and the chemical enrichment of the icm by galactic winds , in a reasonably realistic way ( valdarnini 2003 ; tornatore _ et  al . _",
    "2004 ) .",
    "indeed so far theoretical predictions of the properties of cluster galaxy populations within a fully cosmological context , have been mainly derived by means of semi  analytical models .",
    "high resolution , purely n  body cosmological simulations of the evolution of the collisionless dark matter component , are combined with semi  analytical recipes describing galaxy formation and related physics ( such as chemical enrichment , stellar feedback and exchange of gas and metals between galaxies and their environment ; see e.g.   de lucia , kauffmann & white 2004 for a recent reference ) ; with such schemes , the evolution of galaxies is `` painted '' on top of that of the simulated dark matter haloes and sub  haloes .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that very high resolution can be attained , since pure n ",
    "body simulations can handle larger numbers of particles than hydrodynamical simulations ; besides , a wide range of parameters can be explored for baryonic physics ( e.g.  star formation and feedback efficiency , initial mass function , etc . ) .    in this paper , we present for the first time ( to our knowledge ) an analysis of the properties of the galaxy population of clusters as predicted directly from cosmological simulations including detailed baryonic physics , gas dynamics and galaxy formation and evolution . the resolution for n  body + hydrodynamical simulations can not reach the level of the purely n  body simulations that constitute the backbone of semi  analytical models , so we can not resolve galaxies at the faint end of the luminosity function ( @xmath4@xmath516 ) .",
    "on the other hand , our simulations have the advantage of describing the actual hydrodynamical response of the icm to star formation , stellar feedback and chemical enrichment .",
    "although some uncertain physical processes still necessarily rely on parameters ( like the star formation efficiency and the feedback strength , see section  2 ) , once these are chosen , the interplay between cluster galaxies and their environment follows in a realistic fashion , as part of the global cosmological evolution of the cluster .    moreover , the intimate relation between stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , stellar luminosity , chemical enrichment , supernova energy input , returned gas fraction and gas flows out of / into the galaxies is included self  consistently in the simulations ( while sometimes these are treated as adjustable , _ independent _ parameters in semi  analytical models ) .",
    "the properties we obtain for the galaxy populations ( notably , global star formation rates , luminosity functions and colour  magnitude relations ) are then the end result of _ ab  initio _ simulations , with a far minor degree of parameter calibration than in semi  analytical schemes .    in a standard @xmath0cdm cosmology ,",
    "we have performed n - body + hydrodynamical ( sph ) simulations of the formation and evolution of clusters of different mass , on scales of groups to moderately rich clusters ( emission - weighted temperature from 1 to 6  kev ) . in paper",
    "i of this series ( romeo _ et  al . _  2004 , in preparation",
    ") we analyze the properties and distribution of the hot icm in the simulated clusters , and discuss the effects that star formation and related baryonic physics have , on the predicted x  ray properties of the hot gas .",
    "several sets of simulations have been carried out , assuming different imfs and feedback prescriptions ( see paper  i and section  2 ) .",
    "the chemical and x  ray properties of the icm are best reproduced assuming a fairly top  heavy imf and a high , though not extreme , feedback ( super - wind ) efficiency ( the simulations marked , hereafter , as ay - sw ; see paper  i and table 1 ) .    in this paper",
    "ii we focus instead on the properties of the galaxy population in our simulated richer clusters ( with temperatures between 3 and 6  kev ) , where the number of identified galaxies is statistically significant",
    ". we will mainly discuss the results from the ay - sw simulations , favoured by the resulting properties of the icm ; results from simulations with different input physics ( imf , wind efficiency , preheating ) are also discussed for comparison , where relevant .    in section  2",
    "we briefly introduce the code and the simulations ( full details are given in paper  i ) , as well as the procedure to identify cluster galaxies in the simulations . in section  3",
    "we discuss the global star formation histories of cluster galaxies , and in section  4 we determine global luminosities of the clusters simulated with different prescriptions for baryonic physics . in section  5 and  6",
    "we discuss luminosity functions and colour  magnitude relations of the galaxy population in our clusters , and , finally , in section  7 we summarize our results .",
    "the code used for the simulations is a significantly improved version of the treesph code we used previously for galaxy formation simulations ( sommer - larsen , gtz & portinari 2003 ) .",
    "full details on the code and the simulations are given in paper  i , here we recall the main upgrades over the previous version .",
    "( 1 ) in lower resolution regions an improvement in the numerical accuracy of the integration of the basic equations is obtained by incorporating the `` conservative '' entropy equation solving scheme of springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) .",

    "( 4 ) atomic radiative cooling is implemented , depending both on the metallicity of the gas ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and on the meta  galactic uv field , modelled after haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "( 5 ) star - burst driven , galactic super - winds are incorporated in the simulations .",
    "this is required to expel metals from the galaxies and reproduce the observed levels of chemical enrichment of the icm .",
    "a burst of star formation is modelled in the same way as the `` early bursts '' of sommer  larsen _ et  al .",
    "_  ( 2003 ) : the energy released by snii explosions goes initially into the interstellar medium as thermal energy , and gas cooling is locally halted to reproduce the adiabatic super ",
    "shell expansion phase ; a fraction of the supplied energy is subsequently converted ( by the hydro code itself ) into kinetic energy of the resulting expanding super - winds and/or shells .",
    "the super  shell expansion also drives the dispersion of the metals produced by type  ii supernov  ( while metals produced on longer timescales are restituted to the gaseous phase by the `` decay '' of the corresponding star particles , see point 2 above ) .",
    "the strength of the super - winds is modelled via a free parameter @xmath7 which determines how large a fraction of the new  born stars partake in such bursting , super - wind driving star formation .",
    "we find that in order to get an iron abundance in the icm comparable to observations , @xmath8 and at a top - heavy imf must be used .",
    "( 6 ) thermal conduction was implemented in the code following cleary & monaghan ( 1999 ) , with the addition that effects of saturation ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) were taken into account .",

    "we selected from the cosmological simulation some fairly relaxed systems , not undergoing any major mergers since @xmath28 : two galaxy groups , two small mass clusters , one `` virgo - like '' cluster ( @xmath29 kev ) and a `` mini - coma '' ( @xmath30 kev ) cluster .",
    "treesph re - simulations were run with different super - wind ( sw ) prescriptions , imfs , either salpeter ( sal ) or arimoto  yoshii ( ay ) , with or without thermal conduction , with or without preheating and , as mentioned above , at two different numerical resolutions .",
    "as our reference runs we shall consider simulations with an ay imf , with 70% of the energy feedback from supernovae type ii going into driving galactic super - winds , zero conductivity , and at normal resolution ; these will be denoted `` ay - sw '' .",
    "some other simulations were run with galactic super - wind feedback two times ( swx2 ) and four times ( swx4 ) as energetic as is available from supernovae ; the additional amount of energy is assumed to come from agn activity .",
    "others were of the ay - sw type , either with additional preheating at @xmath3=3 ( preh . ) , as discussed by tornatore _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2003 ) , or with thermal conduction included ( cond ) , assuming a conductivity of 1/3 of the spitzer value ( e.g. , jubelgas , springel & dolag 2004 ) .",
    "finally , one series of simulations was run with a salpeter imf and only early ( @xmath3@xmath54 ) , strong feedback , as in the galaxy formation simulations of sommer - larsen _ et  al . _  ( 2003 ) ; as this results in overall fairly weak feedback we denote this as : sal - wfb .",
    "we refer the reader to papers i and iii , and also sommer - larsen ( 2004 ) , for more details .",
    "the general features and main results for all the simulations are presented in the companion paper  i. in the present paper we mainly discuss the properties of the galaxy populations in the simulated `` virgo '' and `` mini - coma '' clusters , which are in paper  iii referred to as clusters `` c1 '' and `` c2 '' , respectively .",
    "we focus on these two largest simulated objects since they contain a significant number of identified individual galaxies .",
    "the prescriptions adopted for the re - simulations of these two clusters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "lower mass objects are only included in the analysis of the luminosity scaling in section  4 .",
    "we consider the ay - sw simulation as our `` standard '' run .",
    "these simulations provide a satisfactory overall match to the observed properties of the icm ( see paper  i , and also sommer - larsen 2004 ) . for `` virgo ''",
    "we also have simulations with higher feedback efficiency , with pre - heating or with the salpeter imf ( weak or normal feedback ) ; the corresponding results for the galaxy population are shown for comparison , where relevant ( e.g. , figs .  [",
    "fig : lfv ] and  [ fig : rsvirgo ] ) .",
    "because of its high computational demand , the `` coma '' system was run only with the standard ay - sw prescription , with ( cond ) or without thermal conduction .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since younger stellar populations dim faster , the lower the redshift of formation , the faster the magnitude evolution between @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for the salpeter imf",
    ", our photometric code predicts that the observed dimming of @xmath21.2 mag , corresponds to @xmath332.5 in agreement with the above mentioned studies .",
    "the rate of dimming depends however also on the slope of the imf , being faster for shallower imfs ; for an ay slope , the luminosity evolution is in fact slightly faster requiring @xmath34 ( see also renzini 2005 ) .",
    "taking into account progenitor bias , i.e.  the fact the progenitors of the youngest present  day early - type galaxies drop out of the sample at high redshift , the actual magnitude evolution of ellipticals might be underestimated by about 20% ( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) . in this case , @xmath35  mag and @xmath36 ( ay imf ) are still compatible with observations .",
    "the mean redshift of formation for the stars in our simulated galaxies is  2.5 ( paper  iii ) , which is on average compatible with fp constraints but the scatter around the mean is large .",
    "younger star particles , where present , dominate in the luminosity contribution at @xmath31 and induce a much faster overall evolution ( cf .",

    "dimming relation is due to internal age scatter within the galaxies .",
    "we analyze in particular the six brightest objects in the simulation , with @xmath40 ( large symbols in the figure ) , which are more relevant for comparison to the bright spheroidals on the fp .",
    "these objects are 910 gyr old ( average age ) , i.e.   @xmath41=1.52 which corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "however , they also present a large internal scatter in stellar age , as shown by the errorbars in the bottom panel ( stretching from the minimum to the maximum stellar age in each object ) .",
    "in particular , they contain stars as young as 8  gyr , and some of them have minor tails of sf stretching to @xmath43 , i.e.  to ages younger than 7.5  gyr .",
    "the presence of these younger  than  average stars has negligible effects on the present  day appearance of these galaxies , since at @xmath32 all the stars are already quite `` old '' ( ages @xmath44  gyr )  see also fig .",
    "[ fig : redsequence]d showing that the luminosity age equals the actual average age for these objects , while it would be significantly younger if the younger stellar component were prominent",
    ". however , back at @xmath31 these younger  than  average stars become very bright , young populations ( ages @xmath451  gyr ) with a major contribution to luminosity , so that they ultimately drive the overall brightening of the galaxy when we trace it back to to @xmath31 .",
    "the median of the luminosity evolution for all the coma galaxy population is 1.4  mag ( in agreement with the average @xmath36 ) , i.e.  close to the fp constraint ; however the large internal age scatter within the galaxies , especially the brighter ones , induces an overall predicted passive evolution for the lf more extreme than that ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lfz ] ) .",
    "higher resolution simulations can possibly help with this problem , by both anticipating the overall sf process ( resolving smaller , hence denser , substructures ) and reducing the internal poissonian noise in the stellar age distribution of the individual galaxies .",
    "however , the high resolution test presented in   [ sect : resolution ] does not show major differences in the lf down to @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lfhrv ] ) , suggesting that we have reached a resolution good enough to grasp the main galaxy properties .",
    "we are probably then facing here a standard problem of hierarchical models of galaxy formation , i.e.  that they predict both slightly younger average ages ( fig .",
    "[ fig : redsequence]d ) and a larger ( internal ) age scatter for more massive objects , both trends in contrast with observational evidence ( see section  [ sect : sfh ] and references therein ) .",
    "we notice however that the faint end of the present  day colour  magnitude relation of e+s0 cluster galaxies seems to be largely populated by objects which reddened onto the red sequence only recently , while at high @xmath3 they were much bluer ; an effect that is usually associated to the spiral @xmath47 s0 transformation and to the butcher  oemler effect from intermediate redshift to @xmath32 ( e.g.  de lucia _ et  al._2004 ; see also section  [ sect : sfh ] and references therein ) .",
    "these objects are certainly not the same probed by the fp at high redshift , which relates to the most massive ellipticals . also , holden _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2005 ) find a large scatter in mass  to  light ratio and hence magnitude evolution for the least massive ellipticals selected at high @xmath3 , with masses around @xmath48 ( comparable to the most massive objects in our final galaxy population , fig .  [ fig : lfz ] ) . henceforth , it is possible that our simulations miss in fact exactly the massive spheroidals at the bright end of the lf , which are most meaningful for fp constraints .",
    "the issue needs then to be revisited once the problem of properly populating the bright end of the lf is solved for simulated clusters .",
    "the light and stellar mass in clusters of galaxies is dominated by bright , massive ellipticals ( abell 1962 , 1965 ) .",
    "these are known to form a tight colour - magnitude relation , or red sequence ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992ab ; gladders _ et  al . _  1998",

    "_    the solid lines in panels ( a , b ) indicate the observed slope and location of the red sequence ; the dotted line is a least square fit to our data .",
    "there is overall good agreement , although our red sequence is not as extended as the observed one ( which reaches magnitudes as bright as @xmath52 ) , due to the lack of simulated galaxies at the bright end of the luminosity function discussed in the previous section . our slope for the ( u - v ) vs.  v relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : redsequence]a ) , is slightly flatter than the observed one , but the colours of the three brightest objects are in good agreement with observations , even within the observed small scatter .",

    "2a in gladders _",

    "such large scatter is partly due to poissonian noise from the small number of star particles in the low luminosity galaxies . besides , while the observed colour  magnitude relation refers to early type galaxies ( e / s0 ) , we did not attempt any morphological classification and _ a priori _ selection of our simulated galaxies due to limited resolution .        the colour  magnitude relation is classically interpreted as a mass  metallicity relation ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) . in our simulations ,",
    "the bulk of the stars in galaxies are formed at @xmath562 ( see also paper  iii ) , hence age trends among galaxies are only mild ( fig .  [",
    "fig : redsequence]d ) and the colour  magnitude relation is mostly a metallicity effect ( fig .",

    "is displayed fig .",
    "[ fig : redsequence]c , both in terms of mass - weighted metallicity and of ( v  band ) luminosity  weighted metallicity .",
    "the latter is systematically slightly lower than the actual mass - averaged stellar metallicity , as expected since more metal  poor populations tend to be brighter , skewing the luminosity  weighted metallicity to lower values ( greggio 1997 ) ; the trend with galaxy luminosity is however maintained .",
    "although metal - rich objects seem to exist at all luminosities , the fraction of metal  poor galaxies ( as well as the scatter in metallicity ) increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity ; the average stellar metallicity decreases for fainter galaxies ( dotted line ) , which ultimately drives the simulated colour  magnitude relation .",
    "[ fig : redsequence]d shows the average stellar ages for the galaxies .",
    "all the galaxies consist of old stellar populations , with average ages between 7 and 12 gyrs .",
    "the brighter galaxies ( @xmath57 ) are essentially coeval , 910  gyr old",
    ". the luminosity  weighted ages are generally very close to the mass averaged ages , which implies a small scatter of stellar ages within the individual galaxies : extended tails or recent episodes of star formation , would strongly skew the luminosity  weighted estimate to younger ages .",
    "the scatter in age among the galaxies is around 30% , with a mild trend of decreasing age with increasing luminosity ( dotted line ) , but the effect is much smaller that the systematic variation in metallicity ( a factor of 10 , fig .  [",
    "fig : redsequence]c ) .",
    "this confirms that the color  magnitude relation of our simulated galaxies is driven by a mass - metallicity relation , in agreement with common wisdom .",
    "the mild age trend , which tends to act in the opposite direction ( making fainter galaxies redder ) is probably responsible of the fact that our colour - magnitude relation is not as steep as the observed one .    at all magnitudes , even the faintest ones , we find some simulated galaxies with large ( super  solar ) metallicities . for dwarf ellipticals , a very large spread in metallicities and colours with a tail of red , metal rich objects ,",
    "is in fact observed but at fainter magnitudes than those probed here ( @xmath58 , conselice _",
    "et  al . _",
    "metal rich dwarf ellipticals in clusters may possibly originate from larger ( and hence more metal rich ) galaxies that have suffered considerable tidal stripping in the cluster potential . to test this hypothesis we traced the evolution of the nine galaxies with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "8 , back in time .",
    "two of the galaxies were found to contain a significantly larger mass of stars at @xmath61 ( when these galaxy reach their maximum stellar masses ) , whereas the stellar masses of the other seven were found not to change much since their `` birth '' .",
    "therefore , in our simulations , stripping of originally larger galaxies is one possible , but not predominant , channel to form dwarf galaxies of high metallicity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsvirgo ] we assess the dependence of the simulated red sequence on the parameters of the simulation , by considering the `` virgo '' cluster computed with different physical prescriptions ( see section  [ sect : simulations ] and table  [ tab : prescriptions ] ) .",
    "for all the ay simulations the galaxies scatter about the observed red sequence , and their average location in the colour  magnitude diagram appears to be robust with respect to the inclusion of thermal conduction or preheating , and also to enhanced feedback efficiency ( ay - swx2 ; we do not display the case ay - swx4 since the total number of galaxies and their average mass are quite small  see fig .",
    "[ fig : lfv ]  but they still scatter around the observed line ) .",
    "the scatter is however very large and the magnitude range of the galaxies formed quite limited ( missing the bright end of the lf ) , so that one can not make meaningful comparisons to the observed slope of the red sequence .    significantly different is the case of the salpeter imf simulations .",
    "the scatter is much reduced and the slope of the observed colour  magnitude relation is well reproduced ; however , the simulated galaxies are offset to the blue of the observed red sequence .",
    "let us discuss the latter problem first . in the standard superwind case ( sal - sw ) in particular , the stellar populations are too metal poor , hence too blue , to match the observed red sequence .",
    "notice that the blue colours are not due to younger stellar ages , since the star formation history in the virgo cluster is very similar for the salpeter and the ay simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrz ] ) . in the weak feedback scenario ,",
    "where effective supernova energy injection is limited to the early epochs ( sal - wfb ) the simulated red sequence falls closer to the observed one , though still on the blue side . with minor feedback",
    "the galaxies retain a much larger fraction of the metals they produce , thereby the stellar metallicities can grow larger ; however , the price is a predicted enrichment of the icm far below the observed levels for the sal - wfb simulations ( table  [ tab : prescriptions ] and paper  i ) . henceforth , top  heavier imfs than the salpeter imf are needed , not only for the sake of the icm enrichment but also to reproduce the observed colours and metallicities of the stellar populations . in fact",
    "the salpeter imf does not produce enough metals , and/or locks too much mass in stars , to account for the observed metallicities in the icm and in cluster galaxies at the same time ( portinari _ et  al . _  2004 , and paper i ) .    as to the increased dispersion in galaxy properties for the ay vs.  salpeter simulations ,",
    "this is likely induced by the much stronger feedback ( a combination of the sw prescription with a top  heavy imf ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the red sequence in the ay simulations is much less tight , with no well - defined slope , although the average colours of the galaxies agree with observations much better than in the salpeter case .",
    "if the dispersion is mostly due to numerical effects , because of the small number of particles in the individual galaxies , higher resolution simulations should show a reduced scatter  something to be tested in future work .    in summary",
    ", the zero  point of the simulated red sequence appears to be a robust prediction of the simulations , quite unaffected by the adopted physical prescriptions other than the chosen imf , which sets the typical stellar metallicity attainable in cluster galaxies .",
    "the observed slope of the colour  magnitude relation is well reproduced in the salpeter simulations ( plagued however by an offset to too blue colours and low metallicities ) ; for the ay simulations the scatter is much larger but the average colours are better reproduced .    .",
    "symbols follow the metallicity coding of fig .",
    "in this paper we have presented for the first time and analyzed the properties of the galaxy population in clusters , as predicted from full _ ab initio _",
    "cosmological + hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "our results are based on cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters including self - consistently metal - dependent atomic radiative cooling , star formation , supernova and ( optionally ) agn driven galactic super - winds , non - instantaneous chemical evolution , effects of a meta - galactic , redshift dependent uv field and thermal conduction . in relation to modelling the properties of cluster galaxies",
    "this is an important step forward with respect to previous theoretical works on the subject , e.g. based on semi  analytical recipes super  imposed on n  body only simulations .",
    "the global star formation rates of the `` virgo '' and `` coma '' cluster galaxies are found to decrease very significantly with time from redshift @xmath3=2 to 0 , in agreement with what is inferred from observations of the inner parts of rich clusters ( e.g. , kodama & bower 2001 ) .",
    "we have determined galaxy luminosity functions for the `` virgo '' and `` coma '' clusters in the @xmath62 and @xmath63 bands ; the comparison to observed galaxy luminosity functions reveals a deficiency of bright galaxies ( @xmath64@xmath6520 ) .",
    "we carried out a test simulation of `` virgo '' at eight times higher mass resolution and two times higher force resolution ; the results of this test , still running at the present , indicate that the above mentioned deficiency of bright galaxies is _ not _ due to `` over  merging '' ; higher resolution simulations of `` coma '' clusters are in progress as well to further check this point . from a suite of simulations for the `` virgo '' cluster with different input physics ,",
    "we find that the deficiency of bright galaxies becomes less prominent with decreasing super - wind strength , in particular for models invoking a salpeter imf and only early feedback ; in fact more mass can be accumulated in stars and galaxies , with low feedback .",
    "such models , however , present various drawbacks : the cold fraction is too high and the metal production is too low , as seen in the too blue colours of the galaxies and/or in the low metallicity of the icm , which can hardly be enriched to the observed level of about 1/3 of solar abundance ; the latter point is discussed in detail in paper  i , but it also follows from more general arguments ( portinari _ et  al .",
    "the bright galaxy deficiency might be explained as a selection effect , in the sense that we have selected cluster haloes for the treesph re - simulations , which are `` too relaxed '' compared to an average cluster halo , so that the brightest galaxies have by now merged into the central cd by dynamical friction ; we shall return to this in a forthcoming paper .    the redshift evolution of the luminosity functions from redshift @xmath3=1 to 0 is mainly driven by passive luminosity evolution of the stellar populations , but also by the above mentioned merging of bright galaxies into the cd .    the slope of the colour  magnitude relation of the simulated galaxies is in good agreement with the observed one , however the scatter is larger than observed , partly due to poissoinian noise within the fainter galaxies which are formed by small numbers of star particles .",
    "such internal dispersion in stellar ages is also responsible for a luminosity dimming between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , faster than indicated by the observed evolution of the fundamental plane .",
    "the typical average galaxy colours are best matched when adopting a top - heavy imf ( as originally suggested by arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) , while salpeter imf simulations yield too blue colours .",
    "moreover we find that the average metallicity of the simulated galaxies increases with luminosity , and that the brightest galaxies are essentially coeval .",
    "hence , the colour  magnitude relation results from metallicity rather than age effects , as concluded by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) on the basis of its observed evolution .",
