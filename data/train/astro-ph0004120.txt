    "the x - ray emission of seyfert galaxies is commonly believed to be produced by compton scattering of soft photons on a ( thermal or non - thermal ) population of hot electrons .",
    "the non  detection of seyferts by comptel and the high energy cut - offs indicated by osse have focused attention on thermal models ( e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk , 1980 ) . in this case",
    "the x  ray spectral shape is mainly determined by the temperature @xmath3 and the optical depth @xmath4 of the scattering electrons , while the cut  off energy",
    "is related essentially to @xmath5 . moreover , if the comptonizing region and the source of seed photons are _ coupled _ , one can write an energy balance equation for the hot coronal plasma which determines a roughly constant value of the compton parameter @xmath6 ( e.g. , svensson , 1996 ) and thus a one to one correpondence between @xmath7 and @xmath4 .",
    "the required value of @xmath8 depends on the fraction @xmath9 of the power dissipated in the corona and on geometry . in the following the limiting case @xmath10",
    "is considered .",
    "+ in the present work ( petrucci et al .",
    ", 1999 , hereafter p99 ) , we test comptonization models over the high quality data of the ( 8 days ) _",
    "beppo_sax  long look at the seyfert i galaxy ngc 5548 , deriving constraints on the physical parameters and geometry of the source .",
    "these data have already been studied in detail by nicastro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , modelling the continuum with a cut - off power law .",
    "in fig 1a we show comptonized spectra computed for different geometries ( codes of haardt , 1994 and poutanen and svensson , 1996 ) for the same value of @xmath11  0.7 and for a cut  off power law spectrum ( pexrav model of xspec ) with a e  folding energy @xmath12=720  kev , as a first order approximation to comptonization spectral models ( for @xmath13 ) . for the sphere ,",
    "the soft photons are supposed to be emitted isotropically at the center of the sphere , whereas they come from the bottom for the slab and the hemisphere configurations . in each case , the optical depths have been chosen so as to produce approximatively the same spectral index in the 2 - 10 kev x ",
    "ray range ( @xmath4=0.09 , 0.16 and 0.33 for the slab , hemisphere and sphere geometry , respectively ) .",
    "we see that the spectra are quite different at medium - high energy ( @xmath14 kev ) . in the slab and hemisphere cases ,",
    "they can be approximately described by broken power laws , the energy of the break @xmath15 rougly lying between the second and the third scattering order peaks ( haardt , 1993 ) .",
    "the slope at low energies is flat due to the deficiency of photons caused by the anisotropy of the first scattering and is higly angle - dependent . on the contrary , since the higher scattering orders are almost isotropic , the slope above the break is almost angle - independent . due to the presence of this break , comptonization spectra ( in anisotropic geometry ) are softer for @xmath16 than the cut - off power law one .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1b the best fit models derived using comptonization ( in slab geometry ) and a cut  off power law .",
    "the two models require a different normalization for the reflection component ( larger for the slab ) and are roughly in agreement below @xmath17 kev , the upper energy end of our data .",
    "however they differ by up to a factor 10 near 500 kev , since the cut  off energy required by the ( harder ) power law model",
    "is lower than that required by the ( intrinsically curved ) slab comptonization spectrum ( see table 1 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      both slab and hemisphere geometries give acceptable fits to the average data ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) .",
    "the derived parameters are not far from theoretical expectations based on simple energy balance arguments ( cf .",
    "2 ) . for the slab geometry ,",
    "the data suggest that the hot gas is _ photon starved _ , i.e. , it is undercooled .",
    "for the hemispherical geometry the parameters are consistent with the energy balance condition but the required normalization of the reflection component is too large ( cf",
    ". table 1 ) .",
    "this may suggest that the real geometry is intermediate and/or that the physical situation is more complex possibly involving a non uniform corona and deviations from strict energy balance ( see malzac this meeting ) .",
    "independently of geometry , the low  to  high state transition ( the low / high state being the state outside / during the flare ) clearly indicates a change of the compton parameter , i.e. , of the comptonized  to  soft luminosity ratio ( cf .",
    "2 ) . it seems to be most probably due to an increase of the cooling rate , rather than to a decrease of the heating rate , since we observe a pivoting at high energies of the continuum in the two states ( cf .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the spectral softening in the high state is very naturally explained by a drop of the corona temperature , ultimately due to an increase of the uv  euv soft photon flux .",
    "this _ beppo_sax  observation of ngc 5548 allowed us to show that i ) the temperature @xmath18 of the comptonizing plasma can be largely underestimated ( up to a factor of 7 here ) when derived from simple power law models with high energy cut - off ; ii ) the data are well fitted by a plane parallel corona model with an inclination angle of @xmath19 , a soft photon temperature of 5 ev , a hot plasma @xmath1 360  kev and an optical depth @xmath20 .",
    "the latter values suggest however that the hot comptonizing gas , if in the shape of slab , is not in energy balance . a better agreement is obtained with an hemispherical geometry ; iii ) the change of state during the central part of the run clearly indicates a variation of the compton parameter @xmath8 , which could be due , as suggested by the data , to an increase of the cooling .",
