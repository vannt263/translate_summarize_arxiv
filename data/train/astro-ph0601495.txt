    "since its explosion , sn  1987a has evolved from a supernova ( sn ) dominated by the emission from the radioactive decay of @xmath4co , @xmath5co and @xmath6ti in the ejecta to a supernova remnant whose emission is dominated by the interaction of the supernova blast wave with its surrounding medium .",
    "the medium surrounding the sn is dominated by the well - known  circumstellar envelope \" ( cse ) , which consists of an inner equatorial ring ( er ) flanked by two outer rings @xcite , possibly part of an hour - glass structure .",
    "the collision between the ejecta of sn  1987a and the er predicted to occur sometime in the interval 1995 - 2007 @xcite is now underway . at uv - optical ( uvo ) wavelengths ,  hot spots \" have appeared inside the er @xcite , and their brightness varies on time scales of a few months @xcite .",
    "new hot spots continue to appear as the whole inner rim of the er lights up . the visible - light _ hst _",
    "image obtained in 2004 feb 20 reveals a necklace of such hot spots which nearly fill a lighted ring .",
    "ongoing monitoring at x - rays with the _ chandra _ and at radio frequencies , shows that the evolution of the emission from the er follows a similar pattern at all wavelengths .",
    "there exist very few mid - infrared ( ir ) observations of supernovae in general .",
    "therefore sn  1987a , the closest known supernova in 400 years , gives us an opportunity to explore the mid - ir properties of supernovae and the dust in their ejecta and surrounding medium with the help of the newest generation of large - aperture telescopes and sensitive mid - ir instrumentation like the t - recs on the _ gemini _ , in combination with ir data obtained from _",
    "spitzer space telescope_(_sst _ ) @xcite .",
    "the t - recs observations of the mid - ir emission from snr  1987a are part of our continuous monitoring of the sn and its surrounding medium .",
    "the first detection and analysis of mid - ir emission at the position of the supernova has been reported in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the origin of the mid - ir emission could be line emission from atomic species , synchrotron or free - free continua , or thermal emission from dust which is probably the dominant source of emission .",
    "in general , there are several scenarios for the origin and the heating mechanism of the dust giving rise to the late time mid - ir emission in type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "thermal mid - ir emission could be : ( 1 ) the emission from sn - condensed dust that is collisionally heated by reverse shocks traveling through the sn ejecta ; ( 2 ) the emission from circumstellar / interstellar dust heated by the interaction of the expanding sn blast wave with the ambient medium ; and ( 3 ) the delayed emission ( echo ) from circumstellar dust radiatively heated by the early uvo supernova light curve .",
    "our imaging observations provide strong constraints on these possible scenarios for the mid - ir emission .",
    "they show that the bulk of the mid - ir emission is not concentrated on the center of the explosion , but arises from a ring around the sn .",
    "the morphology of the mid - ir emission can therefore be used to eliminate several scenarios for its origin .",
    "combined with _",
    "spectroscopy , our observations can be used to determine the dust composition and temperature distribution in the ring .",
    "chandra _ x - ray , and _ hst _ uvo data provide important constraints on the physical conditions of the medium overtaken by the supernova blast wave .",
    "these constraints can be used to determine the physical association and the heating mechanism of the dust giving rise to the mid - ir emission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first describe in  2 the imaging observations of the sn obtained by t - recs , and compare its ir morphology to that at radio , x - ray , and uvo wavelengths .",
    "lower resolution _ spitzer _ mid - ir imaging observations detected snr  1987a ( including the ring ) as an unresolved point source , and are used in conjunction with spectroscopic data to determine the possible contribution of lines , and the composition of the dust giving rise to the continuum emission . in ",
    "3 we describe the procedure used for the analysis of the spectroscopic and imaging data , determining the dust composition , and presenting maps of dust temperature , ir opacities , and dust column densities . the ir image of the circumstellar medium around sn  1987a has a morphology similar to the _ chandra _ x - ray and _ hst _ uvo images . the limited mid - ir resolution does not allow us to unambiguously determine whether the dust resides in the x - ray emitting gas , or in the uv - optical line emitting knots in the er . we therefore resort in  4 to an analysis of possible dust heating mechanisms and to calculating the inferred dust masses and dust - to - gas mass ratios for several possible scenarios . in  5 we discuss the evolution of the supernova and its environment as manifested from the observed light curves at various wavelengths .",
    "the results of our paper are summarized in  6 .",
    "the t - recs mid - ir imager / spectrometer at the _ gemini _ 8 m telescope offers a combined telescope and instrument with diffraction limited imaging ( @xmath7 resolution ) and superbly low thermal emissivity . on 2003 oct 4 ( day 6067 ) , we imaged snr  1987a with t - recs as part of the instrument s system verification program and we reported on the detection of 10 and 20  @xmath8 emission from the er , and on a 10  @xmath8 emission from the supernova s ejecta ( paper i ) .",
    "subsequent observations were carried out in january 6 , 2005 ( day 6526 ) in the narrow si5 filter ( @xmath9 = 11.66 @xmath0 m ; @xmath10 50% transmission at @xmath11 = 11.09 - 12.22 @xmath0 m ) , and in february 1 , 2005 ( day 6552 ) in the qa filter ( @xmath9 = 18.30 @xmath0 m ; @xmath10 50% transmission at @xmath11 = 17.57 - 19.08 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "results are presented in figures 1-a and 1-b .",
    "these images show several luminous `` hot '' spots distributed over the ring .",
    "the calibrated flux density integrated within an aperture of 1.3 arcsec radius is @xmath12(@xmath13 ) = 18.4 @xmath14  mjy in the si5 filter , and @xmath12(@xmath15 ) = 53.4 @xmath16 mjy in the qa filter .",
    "no color correction was applied and this would most likely increase the flux density . the standard star used for the calibration of the 11.7  @xmath0 m  measurement was hd  29291 , whose flux density was taken to be 6.78 jy at 11.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "we used @xmath17 cma with a flux density of 44.3 jy at 18.30 @xmath0 m  for the flux calibration of the 18.3  @xmath0 m  observation .",
    "the black body colour temperature corresponding to the measured fluxes at these two wavelengths is @xmath18  k and the luminosity is @xmath19 erg s@xmath20 .",
    "we use the @xcite extinction law with @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 to compute the black body temperature and the optical depth for each individual pixel , resulting in the maps shown in fig 1-c and 1-d .",
    "note that in order to have the iterative algorithm converge we must assume reasonable values as a starting point .",
    "we stress that fig 1-c and 1-d show the _ color _ temperature and optical depth maps , which are slightly different from the maps related to the physical dust as calculated in section 3 .",
    "they are shown only for illustrating the results obtained from our data fitted to the simplest modeling ( eg .",
    "black body ) .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we compare our @xmath13 new data with the one obtained in the broad n band ( 10  @xmath0 m ) on october 2003 at day 6067 ( paper i ) .",
    "this figure shows a clear brightening in the south - west region of the er , superimposed on a general brightening all over the ring .",
    "given that the two images are taken with significantly different filters we investigated whether the difference could be due to the different spectral coverage : the spectra obtained with _",
    "spitzer _ which are discussed in next section do not show any feature that could be a source of the difference .",
    "thus we conclude that we are observing a true brightness change .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a , b ) displays our images in both filters with the contours of the 0.38 kev x - ray image from the _ chandra _ observatory obtained nearly simultaneously at day 6529 ( january 913 , 2005 ) @xcite .",
    "the correspondences between our @xmath13 and that obtained by the _ chandra _ is very good , but less so at @xmath15 because of the lower signal - to - noise ratio in that image .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the relation between the ir and x - ray images of the er will be presented in  3 below .",
    "figure  [ fig4](a , b ) shows the contours of the image obtained in the 12 mm band ( 16 - 26 ghz ) at day 6003 ( july 31 , 2003 ) with the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) at the australian national telescope facility ( atnf ) @xcite superimposed on our 11.7 and 18.3  @xmath0 m  t - recs images , respectively .",
    "the correspondences between our @xmath13 image with the synchrotron radio emission is not as remarkable as it is with the _ chandra _ image . nevertheless , the @xmath15 bright spot in the east side looks better correlated with the radio lobe than x - ray spots do .",
    "furthermore , an image obtained in may 5 , 2004 ( day 6298 ) at the same frequencies is posted on the atnf web page and is reproduced here in figure  [ fig4](c , d ) .",
    "this later radio image shows better correlation with our 11.7  @xmath0 m  image than the radio image obtained on day 6003 , probably because it was taken closer to the epoch of the mid - ir observations .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of evolutionary effects on the morphology of the emission at all wavelengths .",
    "there is good overall agreement in shape and size between our ir image and images obtained from the x - ray to the radio .",
    "the mean radii and approximate surface brightness distribution ( brighter on the east side ) of the ring are similar at all wavelengths , demonstrating that the dust is co - extensive with the gas components .",
    "the origin of that brightness asymmetry may be related to an asymmetric distribution of the ejecta or the csm @xcite , and/or to a time - dependence effect caused by the tilt of the er as argued by @xcite .",
    "the most likely source for mid - ir radiation is thermal emission from warm dust ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the x - ray radiation is thermal emission from very hot gas ( @xcite , and previous references therein ) , whereas the optical emission arises from the dense knots in the er that are overrun by slower shocks .",
    "the radio emission is likely to be synchrotron radiation from shock - accelerated electrons spiralling in the remnant s magnetic field as stated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that , until 2000 december , hard ( @xmath24  kev ) x - ray and radio emissions were produced by fast shocks in the cs hii region while the optical and soft ( @xmath25  kev ) x - ray emissions came from slower shocks in the denser er .",
    "@xcite note that as of 2002 dec .",
    "31 ( day 5791 ) correlations between the x - ray and the optical / radio images are more complex than the above simple picture , which is expected as the blast wave is reaching the main body of the inner ring .",
    "imaging of snr  1987a was carried out with spitzer space telescope s mips instrument at 24 @xmath0 m  @xcite and irac instrument at 3.6  8 @xmath0m@xcite ( aorids = 5031424 and 5030912 ) .",
    "almost one year later snr  1987a was again imaged with irac , serendipitously near the edge of the field of observations targeting other sources ( aorids = 11191808 and 11526400 ) .",

    ", the source appears very slightly distorted , and at 4.5 and 3.6 @xmath0 m  the sn appears to be swamped by the emission of companion stars 2 and 3 .",
    "the flux densities at 24 , 8 , and 5.8 @xmath0 m   were measured using sextractor @xcite to perform aperture photometry on the post - bcd images .",
    "aperture radii used were 4 , 5 , and 6 pixels ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) at 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "approximate aperture corrections of 1.10 , 1.07 , and 1.14 were applied using information from the irac and mips data handbooks .",
    "the calibrated flux densities are given in tab .",

    "observations of snr  1987a were also performed with _",
    "s infrared spectrograph ( irs ) in its short ( wavelength )  low ( resolution ) , short - high , and long - high modes @xcite .",
    "these data were also obtained from the _ spitzer _ data archive ( aorid = 5031168 ) . figure  [ fig18 ] shows the slit positions for the different sets of observations . for each spectral mode we extracted sn  1987a spectra from the 2d coadded post - bcd images using spice ( http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/postbcd/spice.html ) . for the short  low data ,",
    "the source is placed at 4 positions along the slit to generate spectra at two positions for two different spectral orders . for each slit position ,",
    "a 2d background image was generated from the median value of the images for the other three slit positions .",
    "these backgrounds were subtracted prior to extracting spectra with spice .",
    "for the high resolution observations , only two slit positions are observed within a much narrower slit .",
    "so for these observations , spice was used to extract the sn spectrum from the columns occupied by the unresolved source , and a background spectrum from columns toward the opposite end of the slit .",
    "the background spectra were then subtracted from the source spectra . for all modes the spectra from the two slit positions ( per spectral order ) were combined using a weighted ( @xmath29 ) average , and ( generally noisy ) data where spectral orders overlapped were discarded . for the short - hi data , an empirically determined scaling factor of 1.38 was applied before averaging to bring results from both slit positions into agreement .",
    "an additional scale factors of 1.46 was applied to the short  high spectrum to normalize it to the short  low data , and a subsequent factor of 1.25 was applied to long - high data to normalize to the short - high data .",
    "these latter scaling factors are to be expected if the subtracted background was partially contaminatead by the source , or in the case that the smaller high resolution slits were slightly misaligned .",
    "finally for the sake of comparison with the broad band measurements and dust models , the high resolution spectra were median  binned using intervals of 12 and 11 wavelength samples for the short and long wavelengths respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the overall calibrated spectrum and figure  [ fig6 ] displays individual profiles and identifications of the main emission lines detected with irs from the _ spitzer _ space telescope : it shows that the t - recs observations are dominated by the dust continuum emission , and not the lines .",
    "the [ ne ii ] 12.81 @xmath0 m and [ ne iii ] 15.56 @xmath0 m lines are however clearly seen .",
    "a weak [ si ii ] 34.81 @xmath0 m line remains after background subtraction , while [ s iii ] 33.48 @xmath0 m disappears entirely .",
    "two strong lines are seen near 26 @xmath0 m : the redder line is [ fe ii ] at 25.99 @xmath0 m and the bluer line is [ o iv ] at 25.89 @xmath0 m .",
    "both lines could be arising from [ fe ii ] ( or both [ o iv ] ) if from fast moving ejecta on near and far sides of the explosion , but the lack of splitting of the other lines makes this seem unlikely .",
    "a weak third component seems present here as well . if fitted as an unresolved line this may be [ f iv ] at 25.83 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , it may also be fitted as the wing of a very broad line ( fwhm @xmath30 2800 km s@xmath20 ) underlying the narrower [ o iv ] and [ fe ii ] lines . such high velocity would indicate an association with the sn ejecta rather than the er for this line .",

    "near - ir j(@xmath31 ) , h(@xmath32 ) , and k(@xmath33 ) imaging observations of snr  1987a were obtained on 2005 , january 35 with ispi attached to the blanco 4-m telescope at the _ cerro tololo interamericain observatory_. results are displayed in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "we clearly see the er at j and k , while most of the emission detected in the h band arises from the supernova itself .",
    "these images have been deconvolved by using the  multiscale maximum entropy method \" algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "the flux densities measured in the ctio data are ( @xmath34 mjy ; @xmath35 mjy ; @xmath36 mjy ) .",
    "these fluxes refer to the total of the er + ejecta in each band ( although each band seems dominated by one or the other ) .",
    "images obtained with hst on november 11 , 2005 through the filters f110w , f160w , and f205w , are also shown in this figure , and show that compared to the ring , the ejecta are relatively brighter in h band ( f160w ) than in other bands .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the validity and the power of the deconvolution algorithm applied to our ctio data .",
    "note , however , that the hst bands are not exactly j , h , k : one significant difference is that the paschen @xmath17 line is missed between the ground based h and k bands , but would be seen in hst s f205w band .",
    "the spitzer mid - ir spectrum indicates that dust in sn 1987a and the er is too cool ( see section 3 ) to emit significantly in these near - ir bands .",
    "we believe that line emission dominates these broadband near - ir observations , and that differences in the composition , temperature , and density of the ejecta vs. csm lead to the different relative brightnesses of these structures .",
    "the young supernova remnants cas a and kepler may be the closest analogs we have for interpreting sn 1987a s near - ir emission .",
    "near - ir spectra and imaging of these snrs by @xcite and @xcite reveal similar variation in near - ir colors .",
    "circumstellar material ( e.g. cas a s quasi - stationary flocculi ) is bright in j due to he i 1.083 @xmath0 m , and emits strong [ fe ii ] lines in both j and h bands .",
    "weaker hydrogen lines can be detected in all bands .",
    "the ejecta in several of cas a s fast - moving knots emit strong [ s ii ] lines at 1.03 @xmath0 m in j , and weaker lines in [ fe ii ] and si in various ionization states .",
    "thus , the near - ir emission of the circumstellar er may be dominated by h and he i lines in j and h with synchrotron emission possibly augmenting the k band @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron processes deserve consideration in sn  1987a particularly in view of the fact shown in figure  [ fig4 ] that the radio morphology of sn  1987a reproduces the ring shape now . also , the h2 molecule has many emission lines in the k - band and longer wavelengths .",
    "spectra are clearly needed for testing the plausibility of the contribution from this molecule or otherwise .",
    "the first overtone band head of molecular co lies at 2.29@xmath0 m and may be also contributing to k - band emission in the ring .",
    "the relatively strong h band emission of sn 1987a s ejecta could reflect [ fe ii ] emission , because a large fraction of the ejecta should be fe from the core of the explosion , whereas cas a s fmks generally consist of lighter metals originating in the outer layers of the progenitor .",
    "figure 5 clearly demonstrates that the mid - ir emission is dominated by thermal emission from dust .",
    "the specific luminosity of a single dust particle of radius @xmath37 at temperature @xmath38 , at wavelength @xmath11 is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the planck function , @xmath41 the dust emissivity at wavelength @xmath11 , and @xmath42 is the dust mass absorption coefficient , where @xmath43 is the mass density of the dust particle .",

    "optical properties of silicate and graphite grains were taken from @xcite , and those for amorphous carbon ( be ) were taken from @xcite .",
    "the results are given in figure  [ fig9 ] , which shows that the t - recs observations alone can not discriminate between the different dust compositions .",
    "comparison with the _ spitzer _ observations clearly demonstrates that the irs observations can be well fit with a silicate dust composition ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) , ruling out graphite or carbon dust as major dust constituents in the csm .",

    "the data presented in this paper show unambiguously that the emission is thermal emission from dust . at issue are the location and heating mechanism of the dust .",
    "the forward expanding non - radiative blast wave is currently interacting with the circumstellar material and the knots in the er . the interaction of the blast wave with the knots transmits lower velocity radiative shocks into these dense regions , producing soft x - rays and the  hot spots \" seen in the _ hst _ images .",
    "the interaction of the blast wave with the dense knots also generates reflected shocks that propagate back into the medium that was previously shocked by the expanding sn blast wave .",
    "the complex morphology and density structure of the er gives rise to a multitude of shocks characterized by different velocity , temperatures , and post shock densities .",
    "the mid - ir images can not determine the location of the radiating dust , whether it resides in the x - ray emitting gas or in the denser uvo emitting knots .",
    "therefore , we can not , a priori , assume a particular dust heating mechanism : collisional heating in the shocked gas , or radiative heating in the radiative shocks .",
    "the relative importance of the two dust heating mechanisms is given by the ratio @xcite : @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are , respectively , the radiative and collisional heating rates of the dust , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are , respectively , the electron density , temperature , and the atomic cooling function ( erg @xmath69 s@xmath20 ) of the gas , @xmath70 is the fraction of the cooling radiation that is absorbed by the dust , and @xmath71 is the cooling function of the gas via electronic collisions with the dust and given by : @xmath72 where @xmath73 the number density of dust grains , @xmath37 their average radius , @xmath74 is the mean thermal speed of the electrons , and @xmath75 is the collisional heating efficiency of the dust which measures the fractional energy of the electrons that is deposited in the dust @xcite .    in the following we will examine possible locations of the dust giving rise to the ir emission . for each possible site ,",

    "the morphological similarities between the @xmath13 emission , dust temperature , and optical depth maps on one hand and the x - ray maps of the supernova on the other hand suggests that the dust giving rise to the ir emission may be well mixed with the x - ray emitting gas .    for an optically thin plasma @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the radiative absorption efficiency of the dust averaged over grain sizes and the radiation spectrum , and",

    "we also assumed that all incident electrons penetrate the dust ( no reflection ) .",
    "above gas temperatures of about @xmath90  k , the temperature of collisionally heated dust is independent of grain radius , and very well represented by a single dust temperature , since both the radiative cooling and the collisional heating rates are proportional to the mass of the radiating dust particle .",

    "chandra _ data indicate @xcite that the  fast shock \" and the  slow shock \" of the model are becoming less distinguishable , as the overall shock front is now entering the main body of the inner ring , that is , the electron temperature of the soft component is increasing and that of the hard component is decreasing . albeit rather speculative",
    ", the overall temperature might thus be  merging \" onto an ",
    "average \" temperature of @xmath95  kev @xmath96  k , @xcite , and intermediate electron densities .",

    "an important diagnostic of a dusty plasma is the infrared - to - x - ray ( @xmath97 ) flux ratio @xcite .",
    "for a given dust - to - gas mass ratio and grain size distribution , the @xmath97 ratio is defined as the infrared cooling to x - ray cooling in the 0.24.0 kev band , and is given by : @xmath98 were @xmath99 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath0 is the mean atomic weight of the gas , and @xmath100 the mass of a dust particle , averaged over the grain size distribution . for a given value of @xmath101 , the @xmath97 ratio is only a function of plasma temperature , and ranges from a value of about 10 for @xmath102  k to a value of @xmath103 for @xmath104  k. for young supernova remnants , @xcite found that the irx ratio is significantly larger than unity for 7 of the 9 remnants considered in their paper , the other two having only an upper limit on their ir emission .",
    "the observed @xmath97 ratio can be obtained from the x - ray and ir fluxes from the sn . from the january 2005",
    "_ chandra _ data , we estimate the x - ray flux in the 0.24.0 kev x - ray band to be @xmath105 erg @xmath106 s@xmath20 after correcting for interstellar absorption by an h - column density of @xmath107 @xmath106 .",
    "note that these values are based on the two - temperature model as used in @xcite .",
    "fractional contributions from the soft ( @xmath108=0.3 kev ) component in the total flux is @xmath3070% for the unabsorbed flux ( and thus for @xmath109 ) .",
    "thus , a contribution from each component in the 0.24 kev x - ray flux seems to be significant rather than being dominated by one of them .",
    "the total ir flux is @xmath110 erg  @xmath106  s@xmath20 which leads to an @xmath97 ratio @xmath30 1 .",
    "this value is lower than the values reported in paper i , in which @xmath97 = 6 for the decelerated slow shock component , and @xmath97 = 3 for the blast wave shock in the two - temperature model .",
    "it is much lower than the theoretical value of @xmath111 , expected for a @xmath112  k plasma , which is observed in the young remnants tycho and cas  a. other ( mostly older ) snrs with measurable ir emission show somewhat lower @xmath97 ratios , but not as low as snr  1987a",
    ".    several effects could be the cause for this very low value of the @xmath97 ratio in snr  1987a .",
    "first , in remnants the @xmath97 ratio was calculated by @xcite for an interstellar dust - to - gas mass ratio of 0.0075 .",
    "the snr  1987a blast wave is expanding into the circumstellar shell of its progenitor star , which , a priori , is not expected to have an interstellar dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "moreover , when estimating the depletion of elements onto dust in the er , we should compare the expected dust abundances in the er with the maximum available abundances for the lmc .",
    "general lmc abundances exist for b stars @xcite and ism @xcite and , although controversy still remains @xcite , the lmc metallicity is usually assumed to be @xmath113 solar . assuming that the fraction of metals locked up in lmc dust is the same as in the local ism , and that the er has the same metallicity as the lmc , then the irx ratio in the er should be about @xmath113 times that expected from supernova remnants in the milky way , still significantly larger than implied from the observations .",
    "the extremely low value of the @xmath97 ratio may therefore be due to a deficiency in the abundance of the dust , compared to interstellar values , which may reflect the low condensation efficiency of the dust in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "second , the dust deficiency could be the result of grain destruction by thermal sputtering in the hot gas .",
    "the sputtering lifetime , @xmath114 , in a plasma with temperatures above @xmath115  k is about @xcite : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the density of nucleons in the gas .",
    "the x - ray emitting gas is highly ionized , and we will assume that its density is that required to heat the dust to the observed range of temperatures , that is , @xmath118 300 to 1400  @xmath82 .",
    "grain destruction is important when the sputtering lifetime is about equal to the age of the shocked gas , which we take to be @xmath301  yr . the low @xmath97 ratio can therefore be attributed to the effects of grain destruction if the dust particles had initial radii between 10 and 50  . so attributing the small @xmath97 ratio to the effect of grain destruction in the hot plasma requires that only small grains had formed in the presupernova phase of the evolution of the progenitor star .",
    "the low @xmath97 ratio shows that ir emission from collisionally heated dust is not the dominant coolant of the shocked gas .",
    "its lower than expected value suggests a dust - to - gas mass ratio in the er that is only a few percent of its interstellar value . the puzzle of the low dust abundance is greater if , in fact , the ir emission arises from dust that is _ not _ embedded in the x - ray emitting gas , but from dust that resides in the uv / optical knots instead .",
    "the possibility that the initial size of the dust grains swept up by the shock is small suggests that the temperature of the grains may not be at the equilibrium value but may fluctuate due to the stochastic nature of the heating and cooling .",
    "very small grains will be stochastically heated if the energy deposited in the grain in a single collision is large compared to its internal energy content , and if its cooling time via ir emission is shorter than the time between subsequent collisions .",
    "assuming that the electron and ion temperature is instantaneously equilibrated behind the shock , the mean thermal energy of the electrons will be 2.6  kev at a postshock temperature of @xmath119  k. using the electron ranges given by @xcite we get that the energy , @xmath120 , deposited in a dust grain of radius @xmath121 and density @xmath43(g  @xmath82 ) by electrons with energies @xmath122  ev is given by : @xmath123 which for @xmath124",
    "g  @xmath82 , @xmath125 m , and @xmath126  kev gives an energy deposition @xmath127  erg .",
    "this value is small compared to the internal energy of the grain , which is about @xmath128  erg at the equilibrium grain temperature of 170  k. the average thermal speed of the electrons is about @xmath129  cm  s@xmath20 , giving an average time between electronic collisions of about 1  sec for an electron density of 300  @xmath82 and a grain radius of 0.0050  @xmath0 m .",
    "this is shorter than the grain s cooling time at 170  k , which is about 10  s @xcite , suggesting that the dust can maintain an equilibrium temperature at that value .",
    "collisions with protons can deposit a significantly larger amount of energy in the dust .",
    "typical proton energies in the shocked gas are @xmath130  kev , and the stopping power for protons with that energy is about 240  mev  @xmath131  g@xmath20 ( nist tabulated values : _ http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/star_ ) . the energy deposited in a 0.0050  @xmath0",
    "m radius dust particle is then about @xmath128  erg , which is about equal to the internal energy of the dust grain at 170  k. so collisions with protons and heavier nuclei can be neglected if they are in thermal equilibrium with the electrons , because of their lower collision rate .",
    "however , if the electron and ion temperatures are not equilibrated behind the shock , then the dust heating rate will be dominated by collisions with the protons .",
    "the time between successive collisions will be about 40  s for a proton density of 300  @xmath82 .",
    "the grains should therefore cool to a temperature of about 100  k before another collision will take place .",
    "however , the data does not support such a broad range of dust temperatures , suggesting that the gas density could be somewhat higher ( by a factor of @xmath132 ) , in which case the dust will cool only to a temperature of @xmath133  k , which may be more consistent with the observations .",
    "all these scenarios support the idea that the dust temperature in the x - ray emitting gas does not fluctuate wildly about the equilibrium dust temperature , which can still provides strong constraints on the density and the equilibration of the electron and ion temperatures in the postshock gas .",
    "the uvo light emitting knots discovered with the _ hst _ resemble a string of beads uniformly distributed along the er . figure  [ fig14 ] and figure  [ fig15 ] depict the map of the dust optical depth overlayed with contour levels of the hst emission obtained on dec 15 , 2004 ( day 6502 ) , the closest to our @xmath13 observations .",
    "the data look very similar , but the ir emission seems to emanate from a somewhat wider region than the optical emission , an effect that can not be entirely accounted for by the lower resolution of the ir data .",
    "nevertheless the good correlation between the ir emission maps and the _ hst _ image , suggest that a significant fraction , if not most , of the mid - ir emission may be emanating from the knots .",
    "the physical conditions of a particular knot ( spot 1 on the er ) have been modeled in detail by @xcite , from the analysis of the uv / optical line emission detected by the _",
    "hst _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "they found that the uv fluxes could be fit with a model consisting of two shocks with velocities of @xmath134 = 135 and 250  km  s@xmath20 expanding into preshock densities of @xmath135 = 3.3@xmath136 and 10@xmath137  @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the postshock temperatures behind the slow and fast shocks are @xmath138 , and 1.5@xmath139  k , with gas cooling rates of @xmath140  erg  @xmath69  s@xmath20 .",
    "the cooling time of the shocked gas is given by @xmath141 , and is equal to @xmath142 0.1 and 2  yr for the slow and fast shock , respectively @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the shock front is therefore @xmath143 and 8@xmath144  cm for the slow and fast shocks , respectively , both significantly smaller than a typical radius of the knot , which is about @xmath145  cm .",
    "so most of the dust in the knot resides in the unshocked gas and is heated by the radiation emitted from the cooling shocked gas .    the radiative energy density seen by the dust is approximately given by : @xmath146 where @xmath147 , and @xmath148 is the compression factor of the gas in the postshock region . for @xmath149",
    "k , @xmath150  @xmath82 , and a shock velocity of 200  km  s@xmath20 we get that @xmath151 @xcite find that compression factors can be as large as @xmath142 550 , giving radiation densities of @xmath152  erg  @xmath82 throughout the knot .",
    "the energy density of the local interstellar radiation field is about @xmath153  erg  @xmath82 .",
    "silicate dust particles immersed in this field achieve equilibrium dust temperatures of about 15  k @xcite . the energy density in the knot",
    "is therefore higher by a factor of @xmath154 than that of the local interstellar radiation field , and the average dust temperature should therefore be higher by a factor of @xmath30 8.3 for a @xmath155 dust emissivity law ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "this gives a typical dust temperature of @xmath30 125  k , in reasonable agreement with the observed average .",
    "the total mass of radiating dust was found to be @xmath157 .",
    "the typical mass of gas in a knot of radius @xmath158  cm , and density @xmath159  @xmath82 is @xmath160 . if @xmath161  20 is the number of knots in the er , then the dust - to - gas mass ratio is @xmath162 , or approximately a factor of 10 less than the average dust - to - gas mass ratio in the local interstellar medium .",
    "the low abundance of dust in the knots could be explained if the dust is efficiently destroyed in the shocked gas _ and _ if the transmitted shocks have already traversed most of the volume of the knots .",
    "calculations presented by @xcite show that about 49% of the silicate grains swept up by 200  km  s@xmath20 shocks expanding into a medium with a preshocked density of 0.25  @xmath82 are destroyed",
    ". this fraction could be significantly higher for the densities encountered by the shocks traversing the knots .",
    "this scenario predicts that the ir emission from the knots was higher in the past , contrary to observed ir light curves ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , if the ir emission emanates from the knots , the low dust abundance must reflect the initial dust abundance in these objects .",
    "the light curves at 10 and 20  @xmath8 are shown in figure  [ fig16 ] : the absolute flux calibration have been made using @xcite 0-magnitude fluxes [ @xmath163(10.0  @xmath0 m ) = 35.24  mjy , @xmath163(11.7 @xmath0 m ) = 28.57  mjy , and @xmath163(18.30  @xmath0 m ) = 10.25  mjy ] .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ fig16 ] that the flux arising from the ejecta at 10  @xmath0 m   declines exponentially from day 2200 through day 4200 ( the isocam and oscir observations ) until day 6000 , at a rate of @xmath164 .",
    "this would imply that the observations on day 4200 are not dominated by the ring emission .",
    "it is likely that the ring emission started around day 4000 , at roughly the epoch when the first optical spot was discovered @xcite , and in good agreement with fig .  5 of @xcite which presents atca and _ chandra / rosat _ data .",
    "the significant increase of the fluxes reported in the present paper compared to the previous fluxes ( fig .  [ fig16 ] ) is consistent with the soft x - ray flux increase observed in the last set of data @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that  something \" has happened at around day @xmath165 .",
    "this is also manifest in the radio light curve at 843mhz from most .",
    "the earlier observations by @xcitefrom 3000 to 6000 days show a steadily increasing flux together with a steadily increasing rate of change .",
    "near day 6000 however @xcite the rate of increase undergoes a more abrupt change upwards , and is therefore clearly associated with the changes seen at other wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ fig16 ] also shows the spitzer data point resulting from integrating the irs data within the appropriate bands .",
    "including these data points shows that the trend of the increase of the flux at 11.7  @xmath0 m  since after day @xmath306000 is better fit by a  linear \" function , while the increase in magnitude vs. time is not linear .",
    "although we do not make strong conclusions , this could indicate that the shock is travelling through structures with cross sections ( as seen from the center of the explosion ) that do not increase with radial distance , like short cylindrical clouds .",
    "sputtering time scales for all but the smallest grains are too long ( 10100 years ) to affect the ir emission , and the plasma cooling time due to the ir emission is also too long ( @xmath166 years ) to affect the time variation in the ir emission .    the 13  cm radio emission light curve ( http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/sn1987a/ )",
    "is also shown in figure  [ fig16 ] .",
    "no data are currently available after day 6244 so it is premature to discuss the associated 13 cm evolution",
    ". it would be surprising if the rate of increase does not change upwards .",
    "while the sudden increase in the x - ray light curve at day around 3700 has been interpreted as the encounter of the shock front with the first protrusions of the er @xcite , the  jump \" after day around 6000 could be the sign of the shock reaching the main body of the er @xcite .",
    "these authors also show that the light curve of the hard x - rays ( 310 kev ) is much flatter than one corresponding to the soft x - rays , and similar to the radio light curves , and they argue that it is likely that the hard x - ray emission comes from the fast reverse shock rather than the decelerating forward shock , just like the radio emission @xcite .",
    "we note that the reverse shock origin for the radio emission is one possible interpretation for explaining the inconsistency of the radio images with the ir and the soft x - rays images .",
    "it is not our intention to discuss evolution of radio fluxes and their relationship to other changes reported in this paper , but we note that the log - log plot in figure 16 hides a significant change in the rate of increase of the 13 cm at 5000 days .",
    "the epoch of increase in the rate appears to be frequency dependent .",
    "an asymmetry in the profiles of optical emission lines that appeared at day 530 showed that dust had condensed in the metal - rich ejecta of the supernova @xcite .",
    "although it was discovered via spectroscopy , the presence of the dust could be easily inferred from the spectral energy distribution : as the dust thermalized the energy output , after day 1000 sn  1987a radiated mainly in the mid - infrared @xcite .",
    "although the presence of the dust emission from the condensates in the ejecta was reported in paper i , we do not detect them in the present observations .",
    "the possibility that this was due to the fact that the present observations were achieved with the narrow si5 filter instead of the broad n filter was investigated , for the occurence of the [ ne ii ] @xmath167 line .",
    "indeed , this line corresponds to a fine structure transition in the ground state of ne ii so the temperature to excite the upper level does not need to be high if there is ne ii .",
    "however , paper i reports a dust temperature of @xmath168 in the ejecta , and there is little evidence for x - ray emission from the ejecta .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray emitting gas would be ionized to a much greater extent than to produce neii .",
    "it is thus most likely that ne ii is coming from warmer regions near the x - rays which are also responsible for the other hst and _ spitzer _ lines .",
    "why then is the ejecta not detected in our last observations ?",
    "in paper i , the n band background sigma was 0.033 mjy / pix .",
    "we used a 12 pixels area to integrate the central source , and then the 3-@xmath169 detection limit was 0.34 mjy which is about the 0.32 mjy measurement reported for the central source in paper i. in the present data , although the source is observed with a better signal - to - noise ratio , the background at @xmath13 is affected by a higher noise , with a 3-@xmath169 background value of 0.47 mjy .",
    "it transpires that we could not have detected a source at the flux level expected from the radioactive decay based light curve ( eg .",
    "@xmath170 mjy ) .",
    "it appears then that the only detection of the ejecta at this late stage is achieved in the h band ( see figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the origin of this emission is most likely due to line emission , although we note that the limiting flux for any continuum emitter at the center of sn  1987a , in the wavelength range 29009650    reported recently by @xcite ( 4.3 mjy in the i filter ) is much above our detection at h ( 0.11 mjy ) .",
    "therefore , our near ir results are compatible with hst observations and do not exclude contribution from a continuum .",
    "supernovae are known contributors to interstellar dust .",
    "the presence of isotopic anomalies in meterorites @xcite and observations of cas  a @xcite and snr  1987a ( paper  i and references therein ) provide direct evidence for the formation of dust in sne .",
    "however , the relative importance of sne compared to quiescent outflows from agb stars in the production of interstellar dust grains is still unclear @xcite .",
    "so far , the dust masses in the the ejecta have been determined observationally for two sne , sn1987a @xcite and sn1999em @xcite .",
    "these masses were @xmath171  @xmath3  and @xmath172  @xmath3  . in both cases",
    "the authors note that these values could be much higher if the dust exists in opaque clumps which may be the case . at face value",
    "however they are much less than the 0.1 - 1.0  @xmath3  required to make sne the dominant source of interstellar dust particles . in future",
    "one must find a means of quantifying the effects of clumping .",
    "observations of the handful of other supernovae in which an ir excess is interpreted as dust forming in the ejecta ( sn  1979c and sn  1985l , and probably sn  1980k ) do not allow an estimate of the mass of dust .",
    "as for the young galactic snr which have been observed by iras and iso ( cas  a , kepler and tycho ) the dust mass deduced is only @xmath173  @xmath3  @xcite , also many orders of magnitude lower than the solar mass quantities predicted .",
    "paper i discusses the role of supernovae in dust production .",
    "we showed there that the dust which condensed in the ejecta of sn  1987a has survived 16 years since outburst , and was still radiating the energy released by the radioactive decay of @xmath6ti at the expected level .",
    "unfortunately , we could not accurately estimate the mass of the dust , and the observations reported in this paper do not allow it either , in the absence of detection of the ejecta .",
    "thus , if we consider sn  1987a as an archetype , our data can neither support nor rule out the hypothesis that supernovae are significant sources for dust production .",
    "we have presented mid - ir images of snr  1987a obtained with t - recs on the _ gemini _ south telescope on day 6526 at 11.7 and 18.3 @xmath0 m  and with irac ( 5.8 and 8  @xmath0 m ) on day 6130 and mips ( 24  @xmath0 m ) on day 6187 onboard _ spitzer _ , together with 3 - 37  @xmath0 m  spectroscopic observations of the remnant obtained with irs on day 6190 at the same observatory .",
    "the imaging observations ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) show that the mid - ir emission arises from the dust in the equatorial ring ( er ) heated up by the interaction of the sn blast wave with its circumstellar medium .",
    "several theoretical models predicted the presence of dust in the cse of sn  1987a which was produced in the winds of the supergiant phase .",
    "the location of the ir emission rules out the possibility that the dust condensed out in the sn ejecta , strongly suggesting a circumstellar origin instead .",
    "the 3 - 37  @xmath8 spectrum ( figures  [ fig10 ] ) shows that the emission arises from a population of astronomical silicate particles .",
    "temperature maps show that the dust temperature is fairly uniform in the er and about 166@xmath174  k , with total dust masses of @xmath175  @xmath3 .    a comparison with _ chandra _ and _ hst _ observations show an equally good correlation between the 11.7  @xmath0 m  ir and the x - ray and uv - optical images of the supernova . because of the limited angular resolution in the ir we can not determine the location or heating mechanism of the radiating dust .",
    "the dust could be residing in the hot @xmath176  k gas and collisionally heated by the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the dust temperature is then an excellent diagnostic of the electron density , giving a value of @xmath177 300 - 1400  @xmath82 , similar to the value suggested by the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "comparison of the ir and x - ray fluxes suggests that the dust is depleted by a factor of @xmath30 30 in the x - ray emitting gas , compared to its value in the local interstellar medium of the lmc",
    ". this low value could be due to its destruction by thermal sputtering in the shocked gas , requiring the initial grain radii to be below @xmath30 50   .",
    "alternatively , the dust could be residing in the uv - optical emitting knots in the er and radiatively heated by the cooling gas that was excited by the shocks propagating through these knots .",
    "a simple calculation for a particular knot shows that the radiative energy density can heat the dust to typical temperatures of about 125  k , similar to those inferred from the ir observations .",
    "a comparison with the mass of the knots shows that the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the knots is lower by a factor of @xmath30 10 compared to its value in the ism of the lmc .",
    "this low abundance reflects the low condensation efficiency of the dust in the outflow of the progenitor star .",
    "we stress that in order to assess the role of sne in the production of dust in the universe , it is clearly important to measure the presence of dust that survives into the formation of the remnant , and for this , mid - ir and sub - mm observations are critical .",
