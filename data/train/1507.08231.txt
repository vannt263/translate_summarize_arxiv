    "the chiral symmetry breaking in the strongly coupling system is interesting phenomena in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "although the coupling strength is small in realistic quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the chiral symmetry can be broken when we consider strongly coupled qed . then it is interesting to study such a system in abelian gauge theories .    for the investigation on the above mentioned chiral symmetry breaking coming from dynamical mass generation , the analysis based on the schwinger ",
    "dyson equation ( sde ) may be an appropriate approach  @xcite .",
    "the sde is the set of equations for green functions whose solutions give the information on the field renormalization and dynamical mass generation ( for reviews , see ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the sde should conceptually lead the gauge and regularization independent solutions , since the equations stem from a renormalizable gauge theory .",
    "however , the solutions practically depend on the chosen gauge , because the equations are derived through applying some approximations in the intermediate steps .",
    "the extensive analyses on the gauge dependence are given in  @xcite where the effects of generalised vertices are studied in unquenched qed with four dimensional cutoff method .",
    "concerning on the similar generalisations of the equations , a lot of works have been done with various approaches , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "also , it is known that the physical predictions as well depend on regularization procedures  @xcite , since the quenched sde can be regarded as the generalised version of the nambu jona lasinio - type gap equations in which regularization has effects on the model predictions  @xcite .",
    "we then think it may be interesting to study the regularization dependence on the solutions of the sde .    in this letter",
    ", we shall numerically solve the sde in general gauge with two regularization procedures , the four dimensional ( 4d ) and three dimensional ( 3d ) cutoff regularizations , then make the comparison between these two methods .",
    "the importance of studying the equations with the 3d cutoff regularization lies on the fact that the solutions can smoothly be continued to the ones obtained in the finite temperature system , since the equations are usually investigated by using the 3d cutoff scheme at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows ; section  [ sec : equation ] presents two types of equations .",
