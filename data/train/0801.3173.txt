    "poor groups of galaxies represent the defining aggregates of the so called `` field '' .",
    "their importance comes from two facts : _",
    "i ) _ most of galaxies in the _ local _ universe is found in groups , rather than in the cluster environment @xcite . _",
    "ii ) _ the transition between galaxy properties typical of field and clusters happens just _ at densities characteristic of poor groups _",
    ", thus suggesting the existence of re - processing mechanisms driven by the environment richness @xcite .",
    "groups show a wide range of properties when adopting a multi - wavelength approach . as far as x - ray emission is concerned , for instance , those dominated by ellipticals are rich in hot and diffuse intergalactic gas @xcite , while in spiral - dominated aggregates as is the case of our own local group a low x - ray emission comes from cold gas mainly confined within fine structures ( shells etc . ) of single galactic sources ( see @xcite ) . whether a link exists between these two different evolutionary outputs in a hierarchical cosmological framework is still matter of debate .    in the group environment we know that galaxy encounters are extremely efficient in reshaping member morphology , being stellar velocity dispersion within galaxies comparable to that of the group as a whole . at the same time , both the merger / accretion rate and the frequency of processes giving rise to tidal dwarfs are still unknown . in this context , we are currently studying with _ galex _ a sample of local groups analogs which includes so far three systems , namely lgg  93 , lgg  127 and lgg  225 .",
    "we present here a preliminary analysis of the lgg  225 group composed of about 10 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we imaged in the near ( nuv ) and the far ( fuv ) _ galex _ bands the ultraviolet emission of ngc  3447 , ngc  3447a , ngc  3454 , ngc  3455 and ugc  6035 aiming at tracing the ongoing star formation ( sf ) and its distribution across galaxies and their intergalactic medium . in order to estimate the paramenters of these sf events we rely on the @xcite population synthesis models",
    "table  1 provides a list of spectroscopically confirmed group members , their optical classification @xcite and total _ galex _ fuv and nuv magnitudes .",
    "our two _ galex _ pointings cover five members of lgg  225 sample , i.e. the bright part of its galaxy population .",
    "the nuv and fuv images of the five prevailing spirals are shown in the panels of figure  1 .",

    "ngc  3447a and its companion ngc  3447 are members of the kpg  255 pair in the @xcite catalogue with a radial velocity difference of about 30  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the two galaxies appear strongly interacting .",
    "a bar is still visible in ngc 3447a , while both the underlying disk and the ( multiple ? ) arms are tidally distorted .",
    "interaction is so strong that , for ngc  3447 , it is even difficult to figure out the original morphological type ( irregular or late - type spiral ? ) . as for ngc  3443",
    ", galaxy has no unambiguous closeby companions , at least in projection .",
    "nevertheless , one can report that the northern half of the galaxy is completely different from the southern one : clearly , a 2  d velocity field is necessary to understand the nature of this asymmetry .",
    "ngc  3454 and ngc  3455 are close both in projection and in the redshift space ( table  1 ) .",
    "the first galaxy displays a clean edge - on spiral morphology while the outer eastern arms of ngc  3455 could be tidally disturbed .",
    "finally , both arms and disk of ugc 6035 are significantly asymmetric with star forming regions confined in the western part of the galaxy nucleus .",
    "when compared to the local group , lgg  225 seems to going through a much more active phase of evolution .",
    "although the uv - optical colors of the innermost ( often bar - like ) bodies of the analyzed galaxies appear quite red and are dominated by an old stellar population , most of the systems show outstanding uv - bright regions .",
    "their measured ( fuv - nuv ) and ( uv - optical ) colors are consistent with the uv fluxes being dominated by moderately young ( few hundred myr or less ) bursts of sf , accompanied by the presence of dust clouds ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    such uv bright , extended sources , especially those located in the tidal tails are the ideal candidate to evolve towards hi - rich , dwarf satellites ( e.g. @xcite ) , affecting the so - called `` missing satellite problem '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and , more generally , actively contributing to the current evolution of the group .",
