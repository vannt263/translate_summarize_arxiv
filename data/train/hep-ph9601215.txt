    "one of the most serious problems preventing precise empirical tests of qcd is the ambiguity of the renormalization scale @xmath9 of perturbative predictions .",
    "formally , any physical quantity should be @xmath9 independent .",
    "however , in practice , spurious @xmath9 dependence appears as one can only have finite - order predictions in a perturbative theory .",
    "unless one specifies the argument of the coupling @xmath10 in the truncated predictions , the range of theoretical uncertainty can be much larger than the experimental error .",
    "although the uncertainty of the prediction contributed from the renormalization scale ambiguity is expected to reduce as the order of the prediction gets higher , we still need a rational way of choosing a value for @xmath9 such that the truncated prediction will approximate the true prediction as close as possible .",
    "a conventional way of setting the renormalization scale in perturbation theory is setting @xmath9 to be the momentum transfer or energy scale @xmath11 of the system ( provided there is only one energy scale ) ; this eliminates large logarithmic terms @xmath12 and so gives a more convergent series",
    ". however , often an order-1 variation of @xmath13 leads to a significant uncertainty in the prediction of perturbative qcd .    in multi - scale processes ,",
    "the problem of scale setting becomes compounded , since the choice for @xmath9 can depend on any combination of the available physical scales .",
    "an example of this is the proper scale for the running coupling constant that appears in the dglap evolution equation for the deep - inelastic structure function .",
    "in addition to the momentum transfer @xmath11 of the lepton , the physical scale can also depend on the bjorken ratio @xmath14 equivalently , the scale controlling the evolution of each moment @xmath15 of the structure function can depend on both @xmath11 and @xmath5 .",
    "collins@xcite , neubert @xcite , and lepage and mackenzie @xcite have emphasized that the renormalization scale should not be fixed by an _",
    "ad hoc _ procedure but rather , should be determined systematically as the mean virtuality of the underlying physical subprocess . from this point of view , the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath9 for a particular prediction to a certain order thus depends on the specific experimental measure and the truncation order .    in this paper , we discuss how to obtain the optimal scale for the structure function evolution using the blm ( brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ) @xcite scale - fixing procedure . in this procedure , the vacuum polarization diagrams that contribute to the non - zero qcd beta function are resummed into the running coupling . more technically , we absorb into the running coupling all factors of the number of flavors @xmath16 that appear in the coefficients of the perturbative expansion .",
    "this criterion automatically sets the scale to a value that reflects the average gluon virtuality of the subprocess .",
    "on the one hand , we can calculate the evolution of the moment by fixing the scale as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath3 before integrating over @xmath3 to obtain the moments ; on the other hand , we can set the scale from the moment - evolution equation for each @xmath5 .",
    "we give the appropriate scale for the moment - evolution equation for each @xmath5 and show that the two procedures give the same result to the order that we consider .",
    "the crucial idea of blm procedure @xcite is that , in the @xmath17 scheme [ @xmath17 is defined through the heavy quark potential @xmath18 by @xmath19 , the scale must be chosen to absorb all the vacuum polarization ( non - zero beta function ) contributions into the running coupling constant .",
    "thus one has to choose the argument of the coupling constant in each order of perturbation theory so that there is no @xmath16 dependence in the coefficients of the coupling constants ( those light - by - light contributions that are not associated with renormalization are not resummed ) .",
    "this is a good choice of scale since all the vacuum - polarization contributions are then automatically summed to all orders for any finite - order prediction . for a next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "perturbative prediction in _ any _ renormalization scheme , the procedure simply translates to choosing the scale such that there is no @xmath16 dependence in the nlo coefficient of the coupling constant , by the transitivity of the procedure to this order @xcite .    to show explicitly how to set the scale for an nlo perturbative qcd prediction , consider a prediction in any scheme of the following form , @xmath20 { \\alpha(\\mu ) \\over \\pi } \\right\\ } + o(\\alpha^3 ) , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the renormalization scale .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are all in general dependent on one or more physical scales such as center - of - mass energy , momentum transfer and bjorken parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 , fixed by the renormalization group @xmath27 are of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath9 independent .",
