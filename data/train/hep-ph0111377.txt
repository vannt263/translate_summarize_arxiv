    "understanding the internal spin structure of the proton is one of the most challenging problems facing particle physics today .",
    "how is the spin of the proton built up from the intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum of its quark and gluonic constituents ?",
    "what happens to spin and orbital angular momentum in the transition between current and constituent quarks in low - energy qcd ?",
    "the small value of the flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath2 extracted from the first moment of @xmath3 ( the nucleon s first spin dependent structure function ) @xmath4 in polarized fixed target deep inelastic scattering experiments has inspired vast activity on both the theoretical and experimental sides to understand the internal spin structure of the proton  for recent reviews see @xcite .",
    "in relativistic quark models and in the naive ( pre - qcd ) parton model the flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath2 is interpreted as the fraction of the proton s spin which is carried by its quark and anti - quark ( partonic ) constituents .",
    "relativistic quark models generally predict that @xmath2 should be approximately equal to the ellis - jaffe @xcite ( or ozi ) value , about 0.6 , implying the questions : where is the `` missing '' spin and what is the qcd physics of @xmath2 ?    the ( initial emc @xcite ) measurement of @xmath5 , one of the main `` surprises '' in recent high - energy physics , has inspired about 1000 theoretical papers and a new programme of dedicated experiments : high - energy polarized deep inelastic scattering at cern @xcite , desy @xcite , slac , and polarized proton - proton collisions at rhic @xcite , as well as lower - energy experiments at jefferson laboratory @xcite , elsa and mami @xcite to understand the spin structure of the proton .",
    "further proposals aimed at completing a definitive study exist for a polarized @xmath0 collider @xcite ( polarized hera collider at desy @xcite or eic collider at bnl @xcite ) and elastic @xmath6 scattering @xcite .",
    "the proton spin problem has also inspired new theoretical thinking and experimental activity on the famous @xmath7 problem of qcd .    in this summary of the workshop `` the spin structure of the proton and polarized collider physics '' ( trento , july 23 - 28 , 2001 ) we review the key physics issues and experimental status .",
    "we start in this section with a brief theoretical overview , following in section 2 with an overview of the present experimental situation and future possibilities .",
    "the key measurements to disentangle to the proton s internal spin structure are discussed in more detail in the sections after that .",
    "much theoretical work has revealed that , in qcd , @xmath2 receives contributions from quark and gluon partons @xcite and a possible non - perturbative contribution at @xmath8 from gluon topology @xcite : @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amount of spin carried by quark and gluon partons in the polarized proton and @xmath12 is the topological contribution .",
    "hence the key driving question is to pin down experimentally the size of each of the different contributions and to resolve the spin - flavour structure of the proton .",
    "this is the main goal of the present and next generation of experiments .",
    "so far the main experimental activity has focused on fully inclusive measurements of the proton s @xmath3 spin structure function with longitudinally polarized targets .",
    "the key issues for the new experiments are to measure the separate flavour- and spin - dependent parton distributions for the proton s valence , sea quark and gluonic constituents , and to investigate the spin structure of transversely polarized protons .",
    "we now briefly discuss the different contributions ; further details on present status and measurability are given in the sections below .",
    "physicswise , @xmath13 is associated with the hard photon scattering on quarks and antiquarks with low transverse momentum squared , @xmath14 of the order of typical gluon virtualities in the proton , and @xmath15 is associated with the hard photon scattering on quarks and antiquarks carrying @xmath16 @xcite . the partonic decomposition ( 2 )",
    "holds also in the ab @xcite and jet @xcite factorization schemes ; in the @xmath17 factorization scheme @xcite the full partonic contribution is written as @xmath18 .",
    "the product @xmath19 in ( 2 ) scales when @xmath20 under qcd evolution @xcite .",
    "this means that gluon polarization plays a potentially key role in any understanding of the proton spin puzzle .",
    "one possible explanation of the proton spin problem is that @xmath21 takes approximately the ellis - jaffe value , about 0.6 , and that ( in the absence of the topology term - see below ) the ozi suppression of @xmath22 is induced by large gluon polarization @xmath23 at @xmath24gev@xmath25 .",
    "measuring the size of @xmath11 is the key issue for high - energy investigations of the proton s internal spin structure .",
    "qcd motivated fits have been applied to the existing @xmath3 data set to try to deduce information about the size of @xmath11 .",
    "the main source of error in these qcd fits comes from lack of knowledge about @xmath3 in the small @xmath26 region and ( theoretical ) the functional form chosen for the quark and gluon distributions in the fits @xcite .",
    "precise data from a future polarized @xmath0 collider at low @xmath26 would be extremely valuable here .",
    "various approaches are planned aiming at a direct measurement of @xmath11 : through semi - inclusive measurements of charm and high @xmath27 hadron pair production in polarized leptoproduction ( compass and hermes ) and photoproduction ( slac ) experiments , and studies of prompt photon production in polarized proton - proton collisions at rhic  see section 4 below . in the longer term",
    "one would like to make a decisive measurement via study of two - quark jet events in @xmath28 fusion at a future polarized @xmath0 collider ( polarized hera or eic at bnl ) @xcite .",
    "the flavour dependence of the @xmath13 may be probed through semi - inclusive measurements in the current fragmentation region of ( e.g. ) fast pions in the final state of polarized leptoproduction experiments .",
    "modulo assumptions on the fragmentation , these data may be used to reconstruct the polarized valence and sea distributions .",
    "more direct measurements will come from @xmath29 boson production in polarized @xmath1 collisions at rhic and from charged current exchange processes in high @xmath30 deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the topological contribution @xmath12 in ( 2 ) is associated with bjorken @xmath26 equal to zero and is related to long range gluon dynamics @xcite .",
    "polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments can not access @xmath8 and measure @xmath31 .",
    "the full @xmath2 may be measured through elastic @xmath32 exchange in @xmath6 elastic scattering .",
    "a finite value of @xmath12 is natural with spontaneous @xmath7 symmetry breaking by instantons where any instanton induced suppression of @xmath22 ( the axial charge carried by partons with finite momentum fraction @xmath33 ) is compensated by a shift of axial charge to the zero - mode so that the total axial - charge @xmath2 including @xmath12 is conserved .",
    "an overview of instanton physics is given in @xcite .",
    "a quality measurement of @xmath6 elastic scattering would provide very valuable information about the nature of @xmath7 symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "if some fraction of the spin of the constituent quark is carried by gluon topology in qcd ( at @xmath8 ) , then the constituent quark model predictions for @xmath2 are not necessarily in contradiction with the small value of @xmath22 extracted from deep inelastic scattering experiments",
    ". a decisive @xmath6 elastic experiment may be possible using the miniboone experiment at fnal @xcite .    in the isotriplet channel things",
    "are much better understood .",
    "the fundamental bjorken sum - rule @xcite @xmath34 is experimentally verified to 10% accuracy by present fixed target experiments . here @xmath35 is the proton s isotriplet axial - charge which is measured also in neutron @xmath36 decay and @xmath37 is the perturbative qcd correction .",
    "the bjorken sum - rule is a rigorous prediction of current algebra and qcd .",
    "the goldberger - treiman relation from chiral symmetry , @xmath38 , relates @xmath39 to the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath40 extracted from dispersion relation analyses of low - energy @xmath41 scattering , meaning that the spin structure of the proton measured in high - energy polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments is intimately related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "the interplay between the proton spin problem and the @xmath7 problem is further manifest in the flavour - singlet goldberger - treiman relation @xcite which connects @xmath2 with the @xmath42nucleon coupling constant @xmath43 .",
    "working in the chiral limit it reads @xmath44 where @xmath43 is the @xmath42nucleon coupling constant and @xmath45 is an ozi violating coupling which measures the one particle irreducible coupling of the topological charge density @xmath46 to the nucleon ( @xmath47 is the nucleon mass and @xmath48 @xmath49gev renormalises the flavour - singlet decay constant ) .",
    "there is presently a vigorous experimental programme aimed at studying the low - energy @xmath42-nucleon interaction , including possible ozi violations , at cosy and jefferson laboratory .",
    "the shape of @xmath3 is particularly interesting .",
    "valuable information about the internal valence structure of the nucleon will come from studying the large @xmath26 region ( close to one ) where su(6 ) and perturbative qcd predict that the ratio of polarized to unpolarized structure functions for both proton and neutron should go to one when @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "precision measurements of large @xmath26 spin asymmetries will be possible following the upgrade of jefferson laboratory to 12 gev @xcite .",
    "small @xmath26 measurements @xcite from polarized @xmath0 colliders would provide valuable information about perturbative qcd dynamics at low @xmath26 , where the shape of @xmath3 is particularly sensitive to the effects of @xmath51 resummation and dglap evolution @xcite .",
    "spin transfer reactions also have the potential to provide valuable insight into the role of spin in qcd hadronization dynamics @xcite . to obtain a leading twist spin - transfer asymmetry requires measurement of the polarization of one of the outgoing particles in addition to having a polarized beam or target .",
    "the self - analysing properties of the @xmath52 hyperon through its dominant weak decay @xmath53 make it particularly appealing for experimental study ; recent studies of @xmath52 production at lep have demonstrated the feasibility of successfully reconstructing the @xmath52 spin @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation functions @xmath54 which describe the non - perturbative hadronization process are the timelike counterpart of the usual parton distribution functions measured in spacelike deep inelastic scattering and represent the probability to find the hadron @xmath55 with fraction @xmath56 of the momentum of the parent parton @xmath57 at a given value of @xmath30 .",
    "they are expected to satisfy perturbative qcd factorization and to evolve under qcd evolution equations .",
    "to date the best known fragmentation functions are those for the most copiously produced light mesons @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "measurement of the @xmath56 dependence of semi - inclusive polarized @xmath52 production in polarized deep inelastic scattering at hermes and compass will help to resolve different models of the fragmentation functions . the ( v - a ) structure of charged current exchange in deep inelastic scattering provides a source of polarized quarks with specific flavour @xcite .",
    "semi - inclusive @xmath52 production events at ( unpolarized ) hera could be analyzed to deduce valuable information on the polarized fragmentation functions . at the high energy and luminosity of rhic",
    "the rapidity distribution of longitudinally produced @xmath52 s in single - spin @xmath60 collisions is particularly sensitive to the spin dependent structure of the @xmath52 fragmentation .",
    "further experimental study of baryon fragmentation is also being actively investigated through semi - inclusive measurements of final state hadron multiplicities in deep inelastic scattering from nuclear targets using the rich detector at hermes @xcite .",
    "these data may provide some insight into the hadron formation times .",
    "the present hermes data from nitrogen and krypton targets show no significant difference between the multiplicity ratios for @xmath61 and @xmath62 production , which are significantly greater than the multiplicity ratio for positively charged hadron production for both targets .",
    "these data have been interpreted @xcite to mean that the proton has a longer formation time than a pion .    in polarized photoproduction",
    "the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum - rule @xcite provides a further important constraint on the spin structure of the proton .",
    "the gdh sum - rule relates the difference of the two cross - sections for the absorption of a real photon with spin anti - parallel @xmath63 and parallel @xmath64 to the target spin to the square of the anomalous magnetic moment of the target , viz .",
    "@xmath65 here @xmath47 is the mass of the target ; @xmath66 is the proton s anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the gdh sum - rule is derived from general principles ( see section 6 below ) and any measured violation would yield new challenges for theorists to explain the qcd dynamics of such an effect . dedicated real - photon experiments at elsa , mami @xcite and slac are presently planned or underway to test the gdh sum - rule .",
    "the low - energy part is dominated by spin structure in the resonance region ; the high - energy part is expected to be dominated by spin - dependent regge dynamics .",
    "exclusive measurements in deeply virtual leptoproduction have recently attracted much attention . deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) provides a possible experimental tool to access the quark total angular momentum , @xmath67 , in the proton through generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite .",
    "the hermes experiment @xcite measure in the kinematics where they expect to be dominated by the dvcs - bethe - heitler interference term and observe the @xmath68 azimuthal angle and helicity dependence expected for this contribution . at lower energies",
    "virtual compton scattering experiments at jefferson laboratory and mami probe the electromagnetic deformation of the proton and measure the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the target @xcite .",
    "the study of single spin asymmetries from transversely polarized targets is currently a subject of much interest @xcite .",
    "these asymmetries are expected to yield information about the density of transversely polarized quarks inside a transversely polarized proton .",
    "the difference between the transversity and helicity distributions reflects the relativistic character of quark motion in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the hermes experiment at desy is expected to start measurements with transverse target polarization in the near future .",
    "the observable is collins single spin asymmetry @xcite for charged pion production in deep inelastic electron proton scattering .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of the final state pions with respect to the virtual photon axis carries information about the transverse quark spin orientation .",
    "further possibilities to access transversity include proposed measurements of transverse single spin asymmetries in @xmath1 collisions at rhic and via interference fragmentation functions extracted from light quark di - jet production in @xmath69 collisions at lep or b - factories .",
    "finally , spin asymmetries offer new variables to search for new physics beyond the standard model , or , when found , to study the chiral structure of these new interactions . already at polarized rhic",
    "there are several examples of new physics searches and studies demonstrating the power of polarized beams .",
    "therefore it would be useful to keep such a possibility also in mind for what one hopes will become the `` parade horse '' to study new physics , namely the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "if the new physics warrants it , polarization could be considered as an upgrade of this machine .",
    "most of the data on polarized scattering to date is provided by deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments . mirrored to the unpolarized scattering experiments , polarized lepton beams and polarized fixed targets",
    "have been employed .",
    "a pioneering experiment was the yale - slac collaboration  @xcite , which measured dis down to @xmath70 .",
    "the measurements of this experiment were consistent with the naive parton model view that @xmath71 of the nucleon spin is carried by its quark parton constituents .",
    "the emc experiment  @xcite at cern used a muon beam and extended the inclusive measurements down to @xmath72 .",
    "the emc data led to the spin puzzle , hinting that the contribution of the quarks to the spin of the proton is small .",
    "these findings triggered a whole program on dis fixed target experiments , with electron beams at slac  @xcite , a muon beam ( smc )  @xcite at cern and the electron ring of the hera collider on an internal target ( hermes )  @xcite at desy .",
    "the latter uses the self - polarization of the electron beam via the sokolov - ternov effect  @xcite to achieve polarized electron beams with about 60% polarization .",
    "the lowest values in @xmath26 for a @xmath30 around 1 gev@xmath25 which can be achieved in these experiments amounts to approximately @xmath73 in smc , due to the high energy of the muon beam .",
    "all of these experiments , apart from hermes , have by now been concluded .",
    "they confirmed the spin puzzle with much increased precision , and launched a series of new measurements , such as semi - inclusive ones . since a few years , the possible culprit to the spin puzzle",
    "is thought to be the polarized gluon distribution , which could be large .",
    "hence a new fixed target experiment compass @xcite has been assembled in the last years , at the muon beam at cern , with its main mission to make a direct measurement of @xmath11 in the region @xmath74 .",
    "this experiment will start data taking in 2002 .    at slac the experiments e159 and e161 are scheduled , and will use polarized real - photon nucleon interactions for spin studies .",
    "the former will study in particular the gdh sum rule , while the latter plans to measure @xmath11 from open charm production .",
    "meanwhile it was realised that polarized @xmath1 collisions could also give information on the polarized gluon , and the @xmath1 and heavy - ion collider rhic at bnl was ` upgraded ' within its construction phase to include the option of polarized @xmath1 scattering @xcite .",
    "polarization of the proton beam is technically more involved than for the electron beam , since protons do not polarize naturally in a storage ring , at least not within any useful time span .",
    "hence beams from a source of polarized protons have to be accelerated through the whole chain , keeping the polarization during the process .",
    "special magnets called siberian snakes allow the protons to pass depolarizing resonances during the acceleration and correct for depolarizing distortions during the storage of the beam .",
    "thus polarized @xmath1 collisions with a centre of mass system ( cms ) energy in the range of 200 and 500 gev could be provided at rhic , with integrated luminosities of 320 and 800 pb@xmath75 respectively .",
    "on the dis front , the commissioning of the hera electron - proton collider ( 27.5  gev electrons on 820  gev protons ) eight years ago opened up a completely new kinematical domain in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , and the two hera experiments have provided a multitude of new insights into the unpolarized structure of the proton and the photon since then .",
    "the success of hera has prompted thinking about future @xmath0 collider opportunities for polarized scattering or @xmath76 collisions .",
    "possible high energy @xmath0 collider projects presently under discussion are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
