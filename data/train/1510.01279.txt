    "there is a question which does not seem conventional . are there some conditions to get long - living states with the continuous energy spectrum in a potential well",

    "besides such dissipative motion there is another scenario of interaction of the string with the attached particle .",

    "the joint particle - string state is stationary and string deformations accompany the particle .",
    "this reminds polaronic state in a solid when the electron is `` dressed '' by phonons @xcite .",
    "our polaronic states in the well are continuously distributed in energy which does not have an imaginary part .",
    "this means that polaronic states of all their energies are non - decaying .",
    "one can qualitatively explain why photons ( string sound waves ) are not emitted by polaronic states .",
    "this is due to the `` hard '' connection of the particle to the string .",
    "emission of waves would result in oscillations of the string including the point of particle attachment .",

    ". therefore shifts of discrete energy levels of the electron ( the lamb shift @xcite ) are small .",
