    "irrespective of their different optical properties and classification , the energy source of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is strongly suggested to be intrinsically the same ( e.g. antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "when broad lines are lacking , a direct view of central engine would be prevented by a dusty absorber , covering a substantial , yet not complete fraction of the solid angle , and thus commonly envisaged as a toroidal structure ( krolik & begelman 1988 ) .",
    "the orientation - based idea that underlies agn unification models ( antonucci 1993 , and references therein ) is still broadly accepted . while it was argued early on that the torus might well consist of individual _ clouds _",
    ", the multiple pieces of observational evidence accumulated in the last decade imply that the circumnuclear environment in agn is characterized by a large degree of clumpiness and inhomogeneity on various physical scales , from tens of pc down to a few hundreds of gravitational radii ( @xmath4 ) from the supermassive black hole ( see bianchi , maiolino & risaliti 2012 ; netzer 2015 for recent overviews ) .",
    "the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc1365 ( @xmath5 ) is an ideal object to probe the complexity of nuclear obscuration in agn .",
    "optically classified as a type 1.8 ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ) , ngc1365 has been extensively studied in the x - rays for its exceptional variability , which makes it the most striking example of a changing - look agn ( matt , guainazzi & maiolino 2003 ) . apparently due to a favourable line of sight",
    ", the inner accretion disc / x - ray corona system is seen through an erratic absorbing medium , whose marked column density gradients are betrayed by the random alternation of compton - thin ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) and compton - thick ( @xmath8 @xmath7 ) states .",
    "the switch from transmission- to reflection - dominated spectra ( and back ) can take less than two days , involving the transit of a single cloud ( risaliti et al .",
    "this kind of eclipses not only sets a tight empirical limit to the size of the x - ray source ( no larger than a few tens of @xmath9 ) , but also provides an implicit measure of the distance and density of the intervening blobs ( both indicative of the gas in the broad line region ; blr ) , and reveals unique details about their shape ( e.g. maiolino et al . 2010 ) . besides this , in the compton - thin regime ngc1365 regularly exhibits four strong absorption lines in the @xmath06.78.3 kev band .",
    "their spacing prompts an identification with the k@xmath2 and k@xmath10 pairs from fexxv  xxvi , blueshifted by reason of an outflow velocity of @xmath115000 km s@xmath1 , variable over timescales of weeks / months ( risaliti et al . 2005 ; nardini et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "these lines could just trace the high - ionization phase of a much more pervasive wind , possibly including all the manifest absorption components ( connolly , mchardy & dwelly 2014 ; braito et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "adding to the overall merit of ngc1365 is one of the largest infrared luminosities ( @xmath12 ) among nearby , non - interacting galaxies .",
    "this mostly arises from the great number of star - forming clusters in the central @xmath023 kpc , disposed in an elongated ring around the nucleus ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "the powerful starburst is also the main source of the observed soft x - ray emission ( @xmath13 kev ) , which is found to be constant in flux and shape .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0500-ks high - resolution spectrum obtained by combining all the 2004 and 2007 data from the _ xmm  newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) is rife with collisionally ionized lines from the hot diffuse gas , at odds with a typical obscured seyfert ( guainazzi et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this paper",
    "we report on two _ chandra _ observations of ngc1365 taken with the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ; canizares et al .",
    "2005 ) over a span of four days , during which the agn remained in a heavily absorbed , compton - thick state .",
    "ngc1365 was observed twice by _",
    "chandra _ in 2012 , on april 9 and three days later ( obsids 13920/1 ) , for a total exposure of @xmath0200 ks . after a series of six 15-ks snapshots in 2006 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2007 ) and a previous one of the same length in 2002 , these were the first observations of ngc1365 at high spectral resolution with _ chandra_.",
    "the hetg consists of two sets of gratings , optimized for medium ( meg ; 0.57 kev ) and high ( heg ; 0.810 kev ) energies , respectively , and was used in combination with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) array .",
    "the data were reprocessed with the ciao version 4.4 software package and the v4.4.9 calibration database ( caldb ) . for each observation ,",
    "the meg and heg spectra were extracted from first - order events in both ( @xmath14 ) diffraction arms .",
    "redistribution matrices were created with the ciao tool ` mkgrmf ` , while effective area files were obtained through the ` fullgarf ` script .",
    "the spectra and detector responses from the @xmath14 orders were combined with the appropriate weights .",

    "( 2009).,width=321 ]    after verifying that the two observations are consistent with each other , in order to improve the data quality for the subsequent analysis we also merged the spectra ( and auxiliary files ) from obsids 13920/1 into a single one .",
    "it is worth noting that we adopted a narrower extraction strip than the default one ( 20@xmath15 instead of 35@xmath15 ) : this allowed us to exclude part of the diffuse x - ray emission associated with the star - forming ring of @xmath015@xmath15 diameter on kpc scale ( 1@xmath16 pc , fig .",
    "[ i m ] ; see also wang et al .",
    "2009 ) , and at the same time to extend the final heg spectrum up to @xmath08 kev .",
    "in all the spectral fits ( carried out with xspec v12.8 , with solar abundances from wilms , allen & mccray 2000 ) we considered the 0.55 kev ( meg ) and 1.58 kev ( heg ) energy ranges , over which a total of @xmath01580 and 1050 counts were collected , respectively .",
    "we initially binned the data to 2048 channels , corresponding to a @xmath17 of 20 ( meg ) and 10 m  ( heg ) , that is roughly the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) resolution .",
    "however , due to the limited number of counts , we further imposed a minimum of four counts per energy bin , and made use of the @xmath18-statistic ( cash 1979 ) . unless otherwise stated , the lines energies are given in the rest frame of ngc1365 , and all the uncertainties correspond to the 90% confidence level for the single parameter of interest ( @xmath19 ) . for simplicity , throughout this work we assumed a standard concordance cosmology with @xmath20 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , although the luminosity distance entailed for ngc1365 ( @xmath021 mpc ) slightly differs from the one based on cepheid variables of @xmath23 mpc ( madore et al .",

    "2009a ) . in the following analysis",
    ", we first focus on the overall shape of the continuum , and then take into account the rich emission - line spectrum in the soft x - rays .      as a starting point we adopted a model that simply consists of three different agn - related components : the primary power - law continuum , attenuated by a foreground screen of cold gas at rest in the source frame ( @xmath27 ) ; reflection off the irradiated matter , described as a ` pexrav ` template ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) with solar abundances , inclination of 45@xmath28 , and variable strength ; and a soft x - ray power law , which is required by the modest spectral rise below @xmath01.5 kev and is intrepreted as the faint , scattered agn continuum .",
    "the latter component can be fitted in several alternative ways , for instance as a thermal bremsstrahlung of @xmath29 kev , possibly associated with starburst - driven shocks . however , due to its negligible impact on the final results and to the small ( @xmath012 per cent ) scattering efficiency implied , we retained for simplicity the link of this soft continuum with the agn , thus assuming a common photon index for the various forms of reprocessed agn emission ( i.e. transmitted , reflected and scattered ) . this model (",
    "hereafter tagged as model a for brevity ) and all the subsequent ones also include the galactic column density ( fixed to @xmath30 @xmath7 ; kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) and the conspicuous iron fluorescence line around 6.4 kev , whose properties remain consistent throughout the fitting steps .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      above 4 kev , only the fluorescence k@xmath2 line from neutral iron at @xmath31 is statistically significant , although the k@xmath10 is clear as well , and there is a trace of ni k@xmath2 ( fig .  [ lz]f ) .",
    "all of these are signatures of reflection of the agn radiadion in cold , optically thick matter , arguably located at the torus scale in the original unification scheme .",
    "we can assess the distance of this gas from the width of the fe k@xmath2 line , which is nicely resolved thanks to its @xmath03540 counts ( @xmath32 ev ; fig .",
    "we assume that the broadening is due to the virial motion in the emitting region , and that the velocity dispersion is related to the fwhm through a factor @xmath33 , which corrects for the ( unknown ) geometry and distribution of the gas ( see also netzer & marziani 2010 ) .",
    "the predicted fwhm is @xmath0760(@xmath34 ) km s@xmath1 , where @xmath35 is the mass of the central black hole in units of 10@xmath36 and @xmath37 is the radial distance in pc .",
    "this expression agrees within a factor of @xmath02 with the case of pure keplerian motion with reasonable orbital inclination ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "far larger uncertainties are associated with the black hole mass .",
    "no direct measurement ( e.g. from reverberation mapping ) is available for ngc1365 , so that the full range of @xmath398 is covered in the literature .",
    "the higher values are based on the correlation of @xmath40 with the bulge luminosity , and are likely biased by the starburst contribution to the latter .",
    "the most sensible guess is then of a few @xmath4110@xmath42 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2009b ; davis et al .",
    "2014 ) . with a conservative @xmath43 , and the observed k@xmath2 fwhm of @xmath03000@xmath44 km s@xmath1",
    ", we obtain that @xmath450.02  pc , which is within the blr . indeed ,",
    "the width of the k@xmath2 line is consistent ( at 90 per cent errors ) with that of the broad nuclear component of the h@xmath10 in the optical , whose fwhm is 1895 km s@xmath1 ( schulz et al .",
    "1999 ) . from the k@xmath2/h@xmath10 width ratio we can deduce that the relative size of the respective emission regions is roughly the same .",
    "this is not surprising in a source like ngc1365 , where blr clouds are responsible for variable x - ray obscuration up to the fe - k band and beyond .",
    "regardless of the precise black hole mass , in terms of the gravitational radius the distance of the fe k@xmath2 reflector perfectly agrees with the universal location of a few @xmath4110@xmath46 determined by shu , yaqoob & wang ( 2011 ) .",
    "intensity versus velocity width , obtained from the unbinned heg spectrum with all the agn continuum parameters free to vary .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the fwhm of the broad h@xmath10 component in the optical , suggesting a common origin from blr clouds.,width=321 ]      as established from the fwhm of fe k@xmath2 ( 3000 km s@xmath1 ) and , provisionally , from those of nex ( @xmath01300 km s@xmath1 ) and mgxii ly@xmath2 ( @xmath0800 km s@xmath1 ) , the gas probed by these _",
    "chandra_/hetg spectra is likely located across the boundary between the classical blr and nlr ( see also crenshaw & kraemer 2007 ) .",
    "it is therefore tempting to try to evaluate its covering fraction ( @xmath47 ) and to explore its connection with the clumps responsible for the x - ray occultations of the source .",
    "to do so , we applied an xstar grid to the 1.31.5 kev band , characterized by the intense lines from mgxi  xii . for",
    "given column density and amount of ionizing radiation , the measured mg luminosity of @xmath48 erg s@xmath1 depends on the fraction of solid angle occupied by the gas .",
    "the predicted luminosity for a full covering of 4@xmath49 sr ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) is degenerate with the column density , but becomes slowly responsive to its exact value at @xmath51 @xmath7 , which is typical for blr clouds in ngc1365 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2009b ) . in that range",
    ", the entailed @xmath47 lies between @xmath02@xmath52 .",
    "this is not far from the nlr covering factor delivered by photoionization models , which , however , is thought to be substantially underestimated ( netzer & laor 1993 ) . indeed",
    ", it should be quite similar to the blr one ( @xmath00.20.4 ; e.g. korista , ferland & baldwin 1997 ) , even if showing a stronger decreasing trend with luminosity ( stern & laor 2012 ) .",
    "a column of @xmath010@xmath53 @xmath7 , still plausible for the nlr , would be needed to match the expectations .",
    "there are several caveats about this simple calculation , though .",
    "for instance , the nearly equivalent intensity of the he@xmath2(f ) and ly@xmath2 lines requires a fine tuning of @xmath54 in a single - zone model .",
    "if a wider range of ionization states is involved , @xmath47 can be considerably higher .",
    "allowing for two components with @xmath55 @xmath7 and @xmath56 and 4.5 , respectively , returns a better fit and a covering fraction of @xmath00.15 .",
    "many other configurations are viable , and also a mild attenuation of @xmath57 by an external absorption layer , maybe at host - galaxy scales , can not be ruled out .",
    "alternatively , given the narrower profile of the mg lines compared to fe k@xmath2 , we can speculate that the innermost clouds significantly reduce the ionizing flux seen by the emitting gas at larger distance , thus producing an apparently low @xmath47 for the nlr .",
    "for @xmath54 and @xmath58 @xmath59 , mg emission would occur at @xmath60 pc , at least an order of magnitude higher than what inferred for fe k@xmath2 ( remarkably proportional to the square of the fwhm ratio ) .",
    "this is the most intriguing explanation , since it is consistent with the under - luminosity in the soft x - ray oxygen lines noted by guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , despite the fact that the agn in ngc1365 is not intrinsically weak .",
    "unfortunately , the current data quality does not warrant any conclusive answer .",
    "the presence of possible rrc from species like oviii or mgxii implies that the emitting gas has a low temperature and that the ionization state is regulated by radiation rather than by collisional equilibrium .",
    "radiative recombination , in fact , is the emission of a photon following the capture of a free electron , mainly to the ground state of an ion .",
    "the shape of the consequent feature is a powerful diagnostic of the gas temperature . in a cold plasma ,",
    "only the tail of high - energy electrons overcome the recombination threshold , and the rrc have a narrow , line - like profile , whose width is @xmath61 ( hatchett , buff & mccray 1976 ; liedahl & paerels 1996 ) . both detections in proximity of oviii and mgxii rrc rely on @xmath067 line counts only in the meg and heg data , respectively .",
    "hence we can not disentangle the putative oviii rrc from the nearby fexviii l - shell transition , in particular if the former is moderately blueshifted .",
    "no blend with other strong lines is instead foreseen at the energy of mgxii rrc , yet we remind that this feature is not statistically significant , so we were only able to put an upper limit of 3 ev ( or @xmath62 k ; @xmath63 ) with a ` redge ` model .",
    "more information can be potentially derived by the he - like triplets , consisting of the resonance ( @xmath64 ) , intercombination ( @xmath65 ) , and forbidden ( @xmath66 ) transitions .",
    "these provide an effective measure of the physical conditions of the gas ( porquet & dubau 2000 , and references therein ) , since the intensity ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 are very sensitive to the electron density and temperature , respectively .",
    "given that ovii is too noisy , neix is formally undetected , and sxvii , arxvii and caxix are too faint and/or unresolved , the only accessible species are mgxi and sixiii .",
    "even if the triplet decompositions proposed above ( which impose outflow velocities of @xmath0700 km s@xmath1 for mg and @xmath01600 km s@xmath1 for si ) are valid , only upper limits can be placed .",
    "the density can be anything below the critical value ( @xmath6910@xmath70 @xmath59 ) beyond which the forbidden components are collisionally suppressed , while temperature is constrained to be @xmath71 k. this is barely meaningful in the light of the appearance of narrow rrc features , but it is enough to exclude collisional ionization in a hot ( @xmath72 kev ) plasma as the dominant mechanism in these emission - line hetg spectra of ngc1365 .",
    "in this paper we have presented the x - ray spectral analysis of the first _",
    "chandra_/hetg observations of the prototypical changing - look seyfert galaxy ngc1365 , which lingered in a compton - thick state for the entire span of four days .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum was thus dominated by a wealth of recombination lines belonging to he- and h - like ions of the most common light elements from oxygen to calcium , plus iron l - shell transitions .",
    "thanks to the unrivaled spatial resolution offered by _",
    "chandra _ , we were able to zoom in on the close surroundings of the agn , and unveil a photoionized gas component that was largely diluted in previous observations .",
    "indeed , the spectra obtained with _ xmm ",
    "newton_/rgs , whose large aperture also encompasses all the diffuse emission from the inner 5 kpc , were heavily contaminated by collisionally ionized plasma , shock - heated by the fierce circumnuclear star - formation activity .",
    "the residual thermal contribution to the overall emission - line intensity now amounts to @xmath030 per cent only .",
    "the emergence of a photoionized spectrum with properties analogous to those reported in most of the nearby obscured seyfert galaxies partly mitigates the apparent anomaly of ngc1365 . in spite of the modest statistical quality of the data ,",
    "whereby only a handful of lines have @xmath73 counts , the picture in favour of cold ( @xmath74 ) gas exposed to the agn radiation is corroborated by the tentative presence of narrow rrc features ( oviii and mgxii ) , and by the qualitative inspection of the he - like triplets ( mainly from mg and si ) .",
    "photoexcitation might be important as well , as indicated by the strength of some higher order transitions ( e.g. nex ly@xmath10 ) and of the fe l - shell forest around @xmath01 kev .",
    "possible outflow velocities in the range @xmath001600 km s@xmath1 are revealed , and a few lines ( nex , mgxi  xii ) show some evidence of broadening ( @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 ) , signifying that the location of the gas is across the virtual blr / nlr boundary .",
    "the k@xmath2 fluorescence feature from neutral iron at @xmath31 kev is resolved to a width of @xmath32 ev , corresponding to a fwhm of @xmath03000@xmath44 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is somewhat larger but fully consistent with the optical h@xmath10 line , supporting a comparable size of the emitting regions . with a preferential distance of few @xmath4110@xmath46 from the black hole",
    ", it is then very likely that fe k@xmath2 arises from the same compton - thick clouds that induce the recurrent column density jumps and the extreme variability seen in this source .    besides the main findings , there are also some unusual hints , such as of broad ( blr - like ) profiles in resonance lines , of double peaks , and of radial velocities of several thousands km s@xmath1 , even in inflow",
    ". if confirmed , these would be absolutely exceptional traits , but caution is mandatory given the poor statistics .",
    "as opposed to standard type-2 seyferts like ngc1068 , the erratic behaviour of ngc1365 below 10 kev makes it hard to amass strictly consistent information from different epochs , so naively it could seem unfeasible to overcome this limitation with just a longer exposure .",
    "however , even in a compton - thin case , the column density is normally of the order of @xmath75 @xmath7 , and the direct agn continuum is almost completely absorbed in the soft x - rays",
    ". the ample record of past observations suggests that a nearly unobscured state such as the one sampled in january 2013 is a very rare occurrence for ngc1365 .",
    "the photoelectric cutoff is thus expected to fall beyond the main complexes from o , ne , mg , and maybe also si , leaving their aspect virtually constant with time and allowing the build - up of a nuclear emission - line template . on the other hand , the appearance of the transmitted agn continuum at higher energies would enable the study of the high - ionization absorption features originating from the accretion - disc / blr wind , from fexxv  xxvi down to caxix  xx and even arxvii  xviii , depending on the exact value of @xmath76 .",
    "for these reasons , any prospective observation of ngc1365 at high spatial and spectral resolution would provide further invaluable insights into the properties of the sub - pc scale environment in active galaxies .",

    "<S> we present the analysis of a _ chandra _ high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) observation of the local seyfert galaxy ngc1365 . the source , well known for its dramatic x - ray spectral variability , was caught in a reflection - dominated , compton - thick state . the high spatial resolution afforded by _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ allowed us to isolate the soft x - ray emission from the active nucleus , neglecting most of the contribution from the kpc - scale starburst ring . </S>",
    "<S> the hetg spectra thus revealed a wealth of he- and h - like lines from photoionized gas , whereas in larger aperture observations these are almost exclusively produced through collisional ionization in the circumnuclear environment . </S>",
    "<S> once the residual thermal component is accounted for , the emission - line properties of the photoionized region close to the hard x - ray continuum source indicate that ngc1365 has some similarities to the local population of obscured active galaxies . in spite of the limited overall data quality , </S>",
    "<S> several soft x - ray lines seem to have fairly broad profiles ( @xmath08001300 km s@xmath1 full - width at half maximum ) , and a range of outflow velocities ( up to @xmath01600 km s@xmath1 , but possibly reaching a few thousands km s@xmath1 ) appears to be involved . at higher energies , the k@xmath2 fluorescence line from neutral iron </S>",
    "<S> is resolved with @xmath3 per cent confidence , and its width of @xmath03000 km s@xmath1 points to an origin from the same broad - line region clouds responsible for eclipsing the x - ray source and likely shielding the narrow - line region .    </S>",
