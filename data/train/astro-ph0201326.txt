    "deep surveys at fir and submilimeter wavelengths have been carried out in order to investigate the nature of dust - enshrouded galaxies at high redshift . as a contribution to this field ,",
    "our group made a deep fir survey using the isophot camera on board the _ infrared space observatory _",

    "mapping at 90@xmath0 m and 170@xmath0 m of two @xmath1 fields in the lockman hole ( lh_ex and lh_nw ) , a region exhibiting the lowest hi column density in the sky ( lockman et al .",
    "1986 ) , resulted in the detection of 36 sources with @xmath2150mjy and 45 sources with @xmath3150mjy .",
    "given the relatively large size of the isophot beam at 170@xmath0 m ( @xmath490@xmath5 ) , we have obtained opt / nir images and spectra using telescopes on mauna kea and 6 cm radio continuum maps using the vla ( yun et al .",
    "2002 ) to identify the most likely source of the 170@xmath0 m emission . here",
    "we report our initial identifications of the brightest of the isophot 170@xmath0 m sources .",
    "redshifts of 35 fir source candidates were determined using optical spectra obtained with esi on keckii during three observing runs in 2000 march and 2001 january .",
    "infrared luminosities , @xmath6 , were then estimated by using the isophot fluxes and assuming an sed similar to that of arp220 .",
    "we found one hyperluminous infrared galaxy ( hylig : @xmath7 ) at @xmath8 , 11 ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs : @xmath9 ) at @xmath10 , 12 luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs : @xmath11 ) , and 11 galaxies with @xmath12 . except for one lig at @xmath13 ,",
    "all of the galaxies with @xmath14 ) are at @xmath15 .",
    "the mean redshift for all sources is @xmath16 .",
    "the low - resolution esi spectra were used to determine the optical spectral - type of the candidate isophot sources . following procedures used by murayama & taniguchi ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the spectra were classified into four types  agns , liners , hii - type , and early - type ( without emission lines ) .",
    "the hylig at @xmath8 was found to be a quasar .",
    "one ulig had an early - type spectrum and 10 uligs are hii galaxies . among the remaining 23 lower - luminosity sources ,",
    "there was one early - type galaxy , one seyfert 2 , 10 liners and 11 hii galaxies .",
    "thus , based on our low - resolution esi optical spectra most of the isophot 175@xmath0 m sources appear to be powered primarily by star formation , consistent with the conclusion reached from an analysis of isophot number counts by matsuhara et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that most of the isophot sources are star - forming galaxies at @xmath17 ."
