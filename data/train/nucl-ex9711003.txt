    "<S> azimuthal distributions of particles produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions are measured with respect to an estimated reaction plane which , because of finite multiplicity fluctuations , differs in general from the true reaction plane . </S>",

    "<S> i propose a general method of reconstructing the fourier coefficients of the true azimuthal distributions from the measured ones . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis suggests that the fourier coefficients are the best observables to characterize azimuthal anisotropies because , unlike other observables such as the in - plane anisotropy ratio or the squeeze - out ratio , they can be reconstructed accurately .    </S>",
    "<S> -5 mm    6.0pt plus 2.0pt    a characteristic aspect of collective behavior in nucleus  </S>",
    "<S> nucleus collisions is that the directions of the outgoing particles are correlated to the orientation of the impact parameter  @xcite : azimuthal distributions measured from the reaction plane ( which is the plane containing the impact parameter and the beam axis ) are not uniform . at energies between 100  mev and 2  gev per nucleon , several experiments have measured azimuthal distributions of charged particles @xcite , identified protons and light nuclei @xcite , charged @xcite and neutral @xcite pions , neutrons  @xcite and @xmath0 baryons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar results have recently become available from the ultrarelativistic heavy ion experiments performed at the brookhaven ags @xcite and at the cern sps@xcite where proton and charged pion azimuthal distribution have been measured . in all these analyses , </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal angle is defined with respect to an estimated reaction plane which , because of finite multiplicity fluctuations , differs from the true reaction plane . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently emphasized that a determination of nuclear equation of state from azimuthal anisotropies requires a good accuracy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to correct the errors which are made in determining the reaction plane .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose a systematic procedure to reconstruct the true azimuthal distribution from the measured ones . </S>",
    "<S> normalized azimuthal distributions can be expressed as fourier series : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the brackets denoting average values , and we assume that the azimuthal distributions are symmetric with respect to the reaction plane ( i.e. even in @xmath3 ) , which holds for spherical nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of all the fourier coefficients @xmath4 allows to reconstruct the full distribution using eq.([fourier ] ) .    in an actual experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the reaction plane is not known exactly . </S>",
    "<S> it is reconstructed event by event from the reaction products . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed plane differs in general from the true reaction plane by an error @xmath5 , which varies from one event to the other . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the measured azimuthal angle @xmath6 is related to the true azimuthal angle @xmath3 by @xmath7 ( see fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> averaging over many events , assuming that @xmath3 and @xmath5 are statistically independent ( this assumption will be discussed below ) , one obtains the following relation between the measured and true fourier coefficients@xcite : @xmath8 from eq.([deconvolution ] ) , we can reconstruct the true distribution once the correction factor @xmath9 is known .    before we calculate @xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly comment eq.([deconvolution ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this equation shows that the measured anisotropies are always smaller than the true ones : they are smeared by the error @xmath5 . more precisely , </S>",
    "<S> if the probability distribution of @xmath5 has a typical width @xmath10 , i.e. if @xmath10 denotes the typical error made in determining the reaction plane , @xmath9 will decrease with @xmath11 and become small for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this has two consequences . </S>",
    "<S> first , the higher order coefficients disappear in the measurement procedure . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , all the distributions measured so far are well reproduced by keeping only the first two fourier coefficients @xmath13 in eq.([fourier ] ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , higher order components might be sizeable in the true distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the second consequence is that observables involving higher order fourier coefficients can not be reconstructed accurately . </S>",
    "<S> this is unfortunately the case for widely used observables such as the in - plane anisotropy  @xcite @xmath14 or the squeeze - out ratio  @xcite @xmath15 which both involve an infinite number of fourier coefficients ( see eq.([fourier ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , fourier coefficients , which are integrated quantities , are also easier to evaluate in theoretical models ( especially in monte - carlo calculations ) than observables using the value of the distribution at a specific point .    </S>",
    "<S> we now recall how the orientation of the reaction plane is estimated from the reaction products : in high energy collisions ( @xmath16  mev ) , the projectile ( target ) fragments are deflected away from the target ( projectile ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the vector obtained by summing all the transverse momenta of the particles produced in the projectile ( target ) rapidity region is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , one constructs a vector * q *  @xcite : @xmath17 where the sum runs over all the detected particles in the event . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is the unit vector parallel to the transverse momentum of the particle , and @xmath19 is a weight which may depend on the type of particle , its rapidity and transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of @xmath19 is to a large extent arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> danielewicz and odyniec @xcite choose @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath24 if @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> many alternative definitions have been used @xcite , some of which do not require particle identification . </S>",
    "<S> this method of determining the reaction plane is commonly referred to as the transverse momentum method . in experiments which measure the energy deposited in a calorimeter , without counting individual particles , an equation similar to eq.([q ] ) must be used , with @xmath19 replaced by the energy deposited in each segment of the calorimeter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we come back to this case at the end of this paper .    for an ideal system with infinite multiplicity @xmath26 , * q * lies in the true reaction plane , and azimuthal distributions can be measured from * q*. in an actual experiment , the multiplicity is finite , which has two effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , because of statistical fluctuations , there is a deviation @xmath5 between the true reaction plane and * q*. another effect of the finite multiplicity is that when one measures the azimuthal angle of a particle with respect to * q * , there is a correlation if the particle is included in the sum in eq.([q ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be avoided by constructing a new vector * q * obtained by summation over the @xmath27 remaining particles @xcite . then , it is reasonable to assume , as we have done , that @xmath3 and @xmath5 are statistically independent . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not quite true for small nuclei where the constraint of global momentum conservation creates important correlations . </S>",
    "<S> a method to subtract these correlations is described in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to evaluate @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that the distribution of @xmath5 is a universal function of a single real parameter @xmath28 , which measures the accuracy of the reaction plane determination , and scales with @xmath26 like @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it is normalized in such a way that for large @xmath28 , the standard angular deviation is @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> . then we express @xmath9 as a function of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explain how to extract @xmath28 from the data .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a large sample of events having the same magnitude of impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , this can be done approximately by selecting events having the same multiplicity , or the same transverse energy , or the same energy in a zero degree calorimeter . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath26 of particles entering the definition of the vector * q * in eq.([q ] ) is usually much larger than unity . </S>",
    "<S> then the central limit theorem shows that , for given magnitude and orientation of the true impact parameter , the fluctuations of @xmath31 around its average value , @xmath32 , are gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> note that both the magnitude and angle of the vector @xmath33 fluctuate ( see fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the direction of impact parameter as the @xmath34-axis . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the two dimensional distribution of @xmath33 takes the form @xmath37 we have assumed that the fluctuations are isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> this will be justified later . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath38 scales like @xmath26 while @xmath39 scales like @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.([gaussian ] ) can be easily integrated over @xmath40  @xcite to yield the distribution of @xmath5 : @xmath41\\exp(z^2 ) \\right\\}.\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the error function . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution depends on @xmath38 and @xmath39 only through the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier coefficients are most easily calculated by integrating eq.([gaussian ] ) first over @xmath5 and then over @xmath40 @xcite : @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the variations of the first coefficients with @xmath28 is displayed in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , @xmath48 decreases with increasing @xmath11 , and becomes vanishingly small for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> experiments report values of @xmath50 ranging from 0.35 @xcite for light nuclei ( @xmath51 ) to 0.94 @xcite for the heaviest ones ( @xmath52 ) , corresponding to values of @xmath28 between 0.4 and 2.2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 shows that the corrections are important in this range .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath53 , the distribution of @xmath5 , eq.([pphi ] ) , becomes approximately gaussian @xmath54 and the fourier coefficients are given by @xmath55    in the limit @xmath56 , the @xmath57 fourier coefficient is of order @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the euler function .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the determination of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the most widely used method  @xcite to estimate the accuracy of the reaction plane determination is to divide each event randomly into two subevents containing half of the particles each , and to construct * q * for the two subevents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one thus obtains two vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given by an equation similar to eq.([gaussian ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , since each subevent contains only @xmath63 particles , the corresponding average value and fluctuations must be scaled : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and therefore @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the relative angle @xmath67 can be calculated analytically ( see the appendix of @xcite and the note added in proof ) @xmath68 + \\chi_i^2\\left[i_1(z)+\\mbox{\\bf l}_1(z)\\right]\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are modified struve functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is normalized to unity between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath28 can be obtained by fitting eq.([corr ] ) to the measured distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can be calculated more simply from the fraction of events for which @xmath74 , which is calculated by integrating eq.([corr ] ) over @xmath75 : @xmath76 alternatively , one can obtain @xmath28 by measuring @xcite @xmath77 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq.([pn ] ) with @xmath78 and @xmath28 replaced by @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath80 with @xmath28 is displayed in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([cosn ] ) is more reliable than eq.([ratio ] ) if @xmath28 is large , for in this case the ratio in eq.([ratio ] ) is very small and is therefore subject to relatively large statistical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> other methods to measure @xmath28 are described in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally justify the hypothesis that was made in writing eq.([gaussian ] ) , namely that the fluctuations have the same magnitude in both @xmath34 and @xmath81 directions . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a consequence of the central limit theorem , which only ensures that the two dimensional distribution of @xmath33 is gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the most general gaussian compatible with the symmetry @xmath82 can be written as @xmath83.\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath84 and @xmath85 characterize the fluctuations along the @xmath34 and @xmath81 axis , which are _ a priori _ different ( the circle in fig.2 should then be replaced by an ellipse ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are related to the azimuthal distribution of particles in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> assuming for simplicity that the multiplicity @xmath26 is the same for all events in the sample ( it is at least approximately true since the impact parameter is fixed ) , we get from eq.([q ] ) @xmath86 where @xmath3 is the _ true _ azimuthal angle of particles , and the last average involves all the detected particles of all events . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the fluctuations in the @xmath34 and @xmath81 directions are given by @xmath87 = 2n\\left [ \\langle w^2\\cos^2\\phi\\rangle   -\\langle w\\cos\\phi\\rangle ^2\\right]\\cr \\sigma_y^2&=&2\\langle ( \\mbox{\\bf q}\\cdot\\mbox{\\bf e}_y)^2 </S>",
    "<S> \\rangle = 2n\\langle w^2\\sin^2\\phi\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define the average fluctuation @xmath39 by @xmath88\\ ] ] and the anisotropy of the fluctuations by @xmath89.\\ ] ] three cases must be distinguished , depending on the relative magnitudes of @xmath38 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    * </S>",
    "<S> \\(a ) azimuthal anisotropies are small , i.e. the fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distribution are much smaller than unity . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath90 and @xmath91 are both small compared to @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> we deduce from eqs.([sigma ] ) and ( [ sigmaa ] ) that @xmath93 : our assumption is justified in this case . </S>",
    "<S> * \\(b ) there are situations where @xmath91 can not be neglected compared to @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the situation when the flow is strong . using eqs.([barq ] ) and ( [ sigmaxy ] ) and the fact that @xmath94 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that in this case @xmath95 : fluctuations are small and @xmath96 ( see fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the distribution of @xmath5 involves only @xmath85 , not @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath84 and @xmath85 may differ in this case , one can replace @xmath84 by @xmath85 without altering the distribution of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this case , @xmath97 , hence the distribution of @xmath5 reduces to its asymptotic form , eq.([asymp2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> * \\(c ) finally , there is the case when @xmath90 is of order @xmath92 while @xmath91 is much smaller . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there is a strong anisotropy in the second fourier component , which should be used to determine the reaction plane . instead of @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , one should construct the vector @xmath98 defined as @xmath99 with the same notations as in eq.([q ] ) , and @xmath100 is an appropriate weight . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane is estimated as half the azimuthal angle of @xmath98 , hence it is defined modulo @xmath73 , i.e. one can not distinguish @xmath3 and @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> this method is equivalent to the diagonalisation of the transverse sphericity tensor , which has been claimed to be more efficient than the transverse momentum method at intermediate energies ( @xmath102  mev , see @xcite and in particular eq.(12 ) of @xcite ) and at ultrarelativistic energies where the flow angle is very small due to increasing nuclear transparency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the procedure described in this paper can be applied to reconstruct the azimuthal distributions , replacing @xmath33 by @xmath103 . however , since the azimuthal angle is defined modulo @xmath73 , only the even fourier components can be reconstructed .    </S>",
    "<S> before we conclude , let us briefly comment on corrections which have been applied , in previous works , to the measured azimuthal distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the method proposed by tsang </S>",
    "<S> _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is based on an ansatz for the distributions of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , which are assumed to be proportional to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a fitted parameter . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is more general in the sense that it does not make any a priori hypothesis on the shape of azimuthal distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of demoulins _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is similar to ours , although limited to @xmath78 and @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that they calculate @xmath50 and @xmath107 independently from measured quantities . the analysis done by the e877 collaboration @xcite is similar , in the sense that the corrections @xmath9 are extracted directly , for each value of @xmath11 , from measured correlations between subevents . on the contrary , our method allows to calculate simply all the fourier coefficients @xmath9 from eq.([cosn ] ) or fig.3 , as soon as we know the first one , @xmath50 .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have described a simple procedure to reconstruct the true azimuthal distributions from the measured ones by means of analytical formulae . </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize this procedure : given a large sample of events in a restricted centrality interval , one measures the distribution of the relative angle between subevents @xmath75 , from which one extracts , using eq.([ratio ] ) or eq.([cosn ] ) , the crucial parameter @xmath28 which measures the accuracy of the reaction plane determination . </S>",
    "<S> then one uses eqs.([deconvolution ] ) and ( [ pn ] ) to reconstruct the fourier coefficients of the true azimuthal distribution from the measured ones .    </S>",
    "<S> a first assumption , on which our calculation relies crucially , is that the fluctuations of the momentum transfer @xmath33 are gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable only if the multiplicity is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> the method should not be applied if , for instance , a single big fragment of the projectile gives the largest contribution to @xmath33 . in order to test the validity of the gaussian hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , one may check that eq.([corr ] ) provides a good fit to the measured distribution of the angle @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> alternative tests are proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our second assumption was that the subevents used in determining the value of @xmath28 are equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> this holds strictly only if the subevents are defined by a random selection of @xmath63 particles . </S>",
    "<S> the subevents are not equivalent if they correspond to different pseudorapidity windows as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , eq.([cosn ] ) can still be used to calculate the correction for arbitrary @xmath11 , once the correction for @xmath78 is known .    </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a parameter @xmath28 to measure the accuracy of the reaction plane determination . unlike other quantities frequently used in the literature such as @xmath50  @xcite , or @xmath108  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath28 scales simply with the multiplicity like @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it has a simple physical interpretation , being the ratio of the average value of the flow vector @xmath33 to the typical statistical fluctuation @xmath39 . and </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it can be directly deduced from measured quantities by simple expressions such as eq.([ratio ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that the fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distribution , which can be reconstructed accurately and are also easy to estimate in theoretical models , are the best observables to characterize azimuthal anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have chosen to measure azimuthal angles around the beam axis . </S>",
    "<S> it was argued in ref.@xcite that azimuthal distributions should rather be measured around the flow axis , determined by a sphericity tensor analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the fluctuations of the sphericity tensor , which is a @xmath109 matrix , are much more complex @xcite than those of * q * , and can not be described in terms of a single parameter @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> there exists no simple procedure to subtract statistical errors in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> what accuracy can be attained with our method ? if the azimuthal angles of @xmath110 particles are measured ( summing over all events ) , the corresponding statistical error on the measured fourier coefficient is @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> systematic errors can be removed , at least partly , using a mixed event technique . </S>",
    "<S> the error on the true fourier coefficient will be larger by a factor @xmath112 , according to eq.([deconvolution ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , with high enough statistics , accurate measurements are possible even if the reaction plane is poorly known , as is the case with light projectiles @xcite . in experiments using heavy ions , it would be interesting to try to measure higher order fourier coefficients with @xmath113 which , although probably small , could be measured accurately . </S>"
