    "finding an explanation for the unexpectedly high temperatures observed in the corona of our sun has been an area of extensive research for decades in the solar physics community .",
    "most of the models for coronal heating involve magnetic reconnection , a change in the topology of the magnetic field which allows it to move to a lower energy state , thereby releasing energy into the surrounding plasma .",
    "+ given the high conductivity of the solar corona , magnetic reconnection can only take place if short length scales ( i.e thin current sheets ) develop in the field .",
    "one theory for the way in which these small scales could develop in coronal loops is via parker s notion of topological dissipation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is that complex but slow photospheric motions acting on simple magnetic fields ( with no null points or other topological features ) will twist and tangle the strands of the loop .",
    "these will then attempt to relax to a force - free state in the low plasma beta environment of the corona .",
    "parker hypothesised that the space of force - free fields is restricted and hence an arbitrarily tangled loop will typically have no smooth force - free equilibrium which can be reached via an ideal relaxation .",
    "instead such a relaxation will develop tangential discontinuities corresponding to singular current sheets .",
    "hence in a real corona with finite resistivity diffusion effects would become large enough for reconnection to occur .",
    "+ a great deal of research has tested the parker hypothesis , with several works lending support to the idea ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "@xcite proved that a smooth force - free field exists for low enough @xmath0 ( where for a force - free field @xmath1 ) .",
    "subsequent numerical simulations into the problem ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have suggested that rather than singular current layers forming , smooth force - free equilibria exist for arbitrary footpoint displacements but that the thickness of current layers decreases exponentially with complexity .",
    "hence , if we assume a photospheric driver , which constantly increases the braiding of coronal fields , current layers will become thin enough to become dynamically important . in either of these cases ( the formation of singular currents or those with a thickness exponentially decreasing in time ) reconnection will eventually be enabled in a resistive plasma .",
    "the primary question addressed in this paper is how loops respond to driving on very long timescales .",
    "some simple considerations show that this response will depend not only on the coronal loop plasma environment but also on the nature of the photospheric motions .",
    "for example , in a corona with a very high resistivity excess magnetic energy will be rapidly dissipated leading to a uniform heating rate . however , in a corona with very low resistivity ( or a perfectly conducting corona ) then photospheric motions can both inject and remove poynting flux ( @xcite ) . in an idealised case with a single vortex rotating in a sequence of opposite directions ( left - right - left etc .",
    ") there would be no overall energy input to the corona .",
    "a more realistic driver will braid the overlying field but can also unbraid the field , depending on how the motions relate to the overlying field configuration . with a low resistivity dissipation will occur in thin current sheets .",
    "simulations of resistive mhd decay ( e.g @xcite ) show a cascade effect of current sheets and a decay timescale that depends strongly on resisitivity .",
    "the long term evolution will then depend on this timescale together with that of the photospheric motions .",
    "several previous simulations have examined the question of long term coronal field evolution . a common feature to all simulations so far ( see overview by @xcite ) is that the loops evolve into statistically steady states where quantities fluctuate intermittently in time about average levels and the poynting flux and dissipation are decoupled on short timescales ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2008 , 2010 , 2013 ; @xcite ) .",
    "simulations by e.g.  @xcite and @xcite ) have shown that the fluctuations have an increasingly intermittent , bursty character at higher magnetic reynolds number @xmath2 . however , a detailed understanding of how the states depend on the driver properties is lacking .",
    "@xcite applied a shearing profile ( changing the shear direction at randomly chosen times ) while most other works have applied incompressible models of convection .",
    "these flows are cellular rotational profiles that can either be time dependent or independent .",
    "two comparison cases of a single stationary localised vortex and of a stationary shear were taken by @xcite .",
    "each of these cases had the same statistically steady state behaviour , which would suggest the profile of photospheric driving is not critical for coronal heating .",
    "in particular the uniformly twisting driver profile in @xcite did not , after the initial kink - instability had occurred , lead to significant build - up of twist in the loop or to repeated kink - instabilities as might have been expected . in a contrasting find",
    "@xcite examined the resistive evolution of two braided fields .",
    "these fields were imposed as initial conditions rather than being constructed by boundary motions and both were found to undergo a dynamic evolution . in the first case was a complex braid where the magnetic field had no overall helicity , being constructed from three twists of positive and negative sign ( modelled on the pigtail braid ) .",
    "the second case was a coherent braid in which the magnetic field had a positive helicity , constructed from six positively twisted regions .",
    "the decay of these two braids gave very distinct behaviours , with the complex case leading to a rather homogeneous heating and the coherent case to a very localised heating .",
    "the aim of this paper is to address in more detail the question of how the nature of photospheric motions changes the type of loop heating . for this",
    "we design a time - dependent photospheric driver with adjustable properties and simulate the long time evolution of loops subjected to various realisations of the driver .",
    "the available properties of the driver include the level of helicity injection as well as flow complexity , measured by the topological entropy .",
    "these properties are discussed and motivated further in section @xmath3 with the details of the driver being given in section @xmath4 . in section @xmath5 the results of the simulations are presented and a discussion is given in section @xmath6 .",
    "the idea of the simulation is to design drivers with varying characteristics which represent photospheric motions , and drive continuously for a long time period in a @xmath4d mhd resistive environment to determine how the different properties impact on the nature of the heating of the loop .",
    "these can be seen as toy drivers - we are concerned with how the fundamental properties of photospheric motions could affect the nature of heating , not with designing the most physically realistic model of photospheric flows .",
    "we take a magnetic field in a high aspect ratio box , representing a volume containing a straightened coronal loop .",
    "this field is initially uniform and a driver is applied at the lower boundary , moving the footpoints at this end of the simulated photosphere .",
    "the typically high plasma beta in the photosphere and largely ideal environment in the corona means that field lines become braided in time as the boundary is continuously driven .",
    "we allow our simulations to run long enough to examine how the loop is heated as a result of the different types of flows . again , at this point we are only interested in comparing the behaviour arising from motions with different properties .",
    "what sort of impact does complexity of the drivers have on heating ?",
    "how much of a factor is the level of helicity in the system ?",
    "is it possible to reach a statistically steady state ? does the driving spark instabilities , and how may they be resolved ?",
    "these are the questions we can address with our simulations .",
    "our driver consists of two incompressible , so - called blinking vortices lying in the same plane , illustrated schematically in figure [ basic_concept ] . the detailed expression for the profile",
    "is given in appendix 1 .",
    "one vortex ramps up to the maximum velocity , maintained for @xmath7 time units before ramping down , at which point a second vortex follows the same process .",
    "the twisting motion of one vortex is completed in @xmath8 time units , giving a driver period of @xmath9 . by completed",
    "we mean the vortex has ramped up to its maximum , driven and then ramped down to zero velocity again .",
    "the driver is periodic in time and the profile is chosen such that the maximum velocity never exceeds @xmath10 of the alfvn velocity so that the driving can be considered as slow .",
    "+ in the first instance we consider two categories of driver with this fundamental action . in the first category",
    "the two vortices have opposite circulation , while in the second the vortices spin in the same way .",
    "these two different types of action have different effects on the braiding of the field .",
    "we refer to the opposite case as the the low helicity case : consider an idealised situation with both vortices centred at the origin .",
    "one vortex spins and then the other starts to spin the other way .",
    "some of the braiding induced by the first vortex will be undone by the second .",
    "negative helicity is injected into the system , cancelling with the positive helicity from the first spin , and poynting flux flow is reversed . on the other hand ,",
    "the equal circulation case is referred to as the high helicity case : the second vortex will only add to the level of poynting flux into the domain and the positive helicity in the system .",
    "+ within these two categories we have a further subcategory .",
    "we fix one vortex at the origin , and place the second at @xmath11 .",
    "the degree of braiding induced in an ideal coronal volume will vary with @xmath12 - for @xmath12 very close to zero , the action of one vortex will affect action carried out by the other more than for @xmath12 much larger than zero , ( recall the exponential form ) , resulting in braids of different complexity . + we measure this complexity using the quantity of topological entropy of the flows described by the driver functions .",
    "further details can be found in appendix @xmath3 , but one description of the quantity given in @xcite is the asymptotic growth rate of material lines  in a flow . consider the flow generated by our drivers .",
    "if we follow the trajectories of particles at some initial positions in this flow , and plot them in time , where time is our z - axis , we obtain a braid . in an idealised situation the field lines anchored in the flow at the same initial positions would be twisted and tangled according to these trajectories .",
    "the braid of field lines would mirror the braid of trajectories .",
    "the method of calculation of topological entropy involves applying the braiding action to a material line in a flow and measuring the rate of stretching of the line .",
    "therefore by analogy , in our coronal loop scenario , higher topological entropy means a more complex driving motion and more complex tangling of the strands .",
    "we find that in general the low helicity case has higher entropy values than the high helicity case .",
    "therefore we can also refer to the case of opposite twists case as the complex case and equal twists as the coherent case .",
    "+ the underlying properties of the @xmath13 runs for which results are presented here are summarised in table @xmath14 .",
    "our two main cases are : group @xmath14 , the opposite twist , complex but low helicity case , within which we vary @xmath12 , and group @xmath3 , the equal twist , coherent and high helicity situation where we test the same values of @xmath12 .",
    "+    a , b and c is anticlockwise and and clockwise in cases @xmath3 a , b and c. the position @xmath11 of the centre of the dashed line vortex is varied , but always twists clockwise .",

    "on examination of the simulation results , we find that the low and high helicity cases exhibit very different behaviours .",
    "the low helicity case runs reach statistically steady states and we see steady heating of the loop , at levels corresponding to the ordering by topological entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "the high helicity cases have less consistent behaviour , with evidence for intermittent instabilities and typically higher levels of heating .",
    "we describe each of the situations in turn in the following sections .",
    "figure [ enb_low_h ] compares the total magnetic energy evolution for our three different low helicity drivers ( distinguished by different vortex centre positions @xmath12 ) .",
    "the key feature to note in all cases is that the runs reach statistically steady states where the magnetic energy averaged over 100 driver cycles ( @xmath16 7500 time units ) remains roughly constant .",
    "after about @xmath17 time units , or @xmath18 alfvn times , during which we see an overall steady rise , the magnetic energy begins to display behaviour with a regular pattern .",
    "there is a bursty profile to all three lines , resulting from repeated small energy release events . here and through the rest of the paper , where lines appear to be very thick due to the high number of oscillations in the line profiles we also plot an enlarged section of the run . from figure [ enb_low_h]b",

    "the aim of this work has been to understand the ways in which different types of photospheric motions that drive field line braiding can affect the nature of heating of coronal loops .",
    "we designed a series of drivers with varying complexity and ability to inject helicity into a domain .",
    "these consisted of two blinking vortices lying in the xy plane .",
    "they fell into two main categories - high helicity ( coherent action by drivers ) and low helicity ( complex action by drivers ) . within these two categories we varied the position of second vortex in order to create further incarnations of the flows .",
    "the low helicity drivers had typically higher complexities as measured by their topological entropy than their high helicity equivalents .",
    "+ long duration fully @xmath4d mhd simulations of a straightened coronal loop under the influence of these drivers showed some new and surprising features .",
    "it was found that the low helicity motions gave rise to a statistically steady state in which a low ( relative to this work ) level of heating was reached .",
    "depending on the time scale of the driver this heating output could nevertheless be sufficient to heat the corona .",
    "additionally , the magnitude of magnetic energy and heating injected into the system corresponded directly to the measured topological entropy .",
    "magnetic energy and heating profiles were ordered in terms of magnitude by @xmath21 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with entropy measurements increasing respectively . here",
    "complexity seems to have been the dominant factor in the level of heating .",
    "+ in our high helicity case we trigger a kink - like instability in our most coherent cases and do not settle to a statistically steady state .",
    "furthermore , we do not see the same correspondence with entropy as before .",
    "the lowest entropy run , for @xmath21 , has the highest magnetic energy and heating profiles .",
    "this is the most coherent case - the vortices are closest together so that the structure of the field is being twisted to higher degree , injecting the most poynting flux .",
    "this situation resulted in steep increases in magnetic energy until conditions were reached to trigger an instability , releasing relatively large amounts of energy in the form of heat over just a few driver periods .",
    "the second most coherent is the run @xmath26 .",
    "we see similar large discharges of magnetic energy but not on the same scale as before .",
    "finally , our least coherent of these three runs , @xmath27 , which was also the most complex of the three , does not display such large scale features .",
    "it would appear that here it is the helicity that is the key factor .",
    "+ coherent , low complexity but high helicity - injecting motions on the photospheric appear to be the most effective at heating coronal loops . both sets of runs exhibit bursty magnetic energy profiles , showing that in all cases we have small reconnection events occurring at regular intervals .",
    "however it seems only the most coherent cases are able to twist field lines to a high enough degree to trigger some larger scale instability and supply higher levels of thermal energy .",
    "we have shown that the type of driver is in fact crucial in determining the nature of heating in a loop .",
    "+ ; the authors would like to acknowledge financial support from stfc , ( grant code st / k502443/1 and st / k000993 ) .",
    "computations were carried out on the ukmhd consortium cluster funded by stfc and srif .",
    "we are also grateful for advice on topological entropy from jean - luc thiffeault .",
    "here we present the full expression of the driver :    @xmath82    where @xmath83 in the low helicity case and @xmath84 in the high helicity case , and    @xmath85    @xmath86    the driving velocity was extended to be infinitely time periodic .",
    "+ the driving speed and duration were chosen to satisfy two criteria .",
    "the first was to give a maximum velocity around @xmath87 of the alfvn speed , corresponding to slow driving .",
    "the second criterion was due to the fact that this work follows on from that in papers such as @xcite .",
    "the twists in the braids examined had magnitude @xmath88 , and so we chose parameters which advected a particle starting at the origin roughly minus @xmath88 with a twist of the first vortex . + in principal however the rate of ramp up , period of maximum driving , amplitude of maximum driving and rate of ramp down can all be adjusted for the user s purposes . at a time of maximum",
    "driving , the driver strength declines exponentially from a maximum of about @xmath87 at a radius of @xmath14 ( reaching a value of @xmath89 at a radius of @xmath90 ) .",
    "topological entropy is a measure of the chaos of a @xmath3d flow .",
    "it has many equivalent descriptions , but @xcite quotes asymptotic growth rate of material lines . calculating the exact value of the topological entropy of a flow",
    "is complicated , but a method to estimate it using braids was described in @xcite .",
    "a numerical scheme was devised and detailed in @xcite and a further version of the code developed by jean - luc thiffeault at the university of wisconsin , madison .",
    "it is a matlab package called , which is freely available at .",
    "this is the package used for this work . here",
    "we give a brief description of the principal of the technique .",
    "+ we now elaborate on the method behind the calculations . as mentioned , when trajectories in the flow are plotted as a function of time , a braid diagram is obtained .",
    "each intersection can be described as a braid generator and labelled according to which trajectories are involved and the sign of the crossing ( positive or negative twist ) . in this way we can build an algebraic representation of a braid , consisting of the braid generators .",
    "we can estimate the entropy of the entire flow by calculating the entropy of this braid .",
    "the more particle trajectories we track , the closer we get to the true flow entropy .",
    "+ now , this braiding sequence can be applied to some random material line inserted into the flow . as the particles move around the material line will be stretched and folded accordingly - the higher the rate of stretching , the higher the entropy . we can calculate the number of intersections of the material line with the real axis as it is distorted by the action of the braid .",
    "a better estimation can be obtained by taking several different sets of trajectories , computing the intersections , and taking averages in individual time intervals .",
    "plotting these values at the recorded times and taking the gradient of the best fit line gives the entropy estimate .",
    "+ we found that the estimate also improved as the number of periods the driver ran for was increased , therefore giving longer braids to work with and an entropy per period .",
    "however the user can run into problems where braids become very long , and repeatedly iterating and trying to calculate intersection numbers can result in attainment of the computational limit .",
    "we encountered this problem in our work , and so instead measured the complexity of the braid , another function included in the package .",
    "this does not repeatedly iterate like the entropy function .",
    "dividing this quantity by the number of periods the braid has been driven for , when this number is large enough , is an alternative method of obtaining the entropy estimate , and is the one we employed .",
    "+      figure [ topent ] illustrates that the entropy in both helicity cases reaches a peak value as @xmath12 increases from @xmath91 and then starts to decrease past a critical value .",
    "the high helicity , coherent case generally has lower values .",
    "error bars correspond to a @xmath92 confidence interval about a sample mean , sample size 5 .",
