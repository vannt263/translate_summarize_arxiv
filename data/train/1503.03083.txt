    "<S> such an alternative single - photon source could be characterized by a very low input power operation , i.e. comparable to standard single - photon devices based on cavity qed but much lower than typical integrated single - photon sources based on enhanced four - wave mixing and heralding . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by an unprecedented small footprint area , significantly smaller than recently realized heralded sources in integrated soi chips . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , notice that the footprint of this prospected device is essentially given by the spatial extension of the photonic crystal molecule and the necessary lattice around it . for the structure simulated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we estimate a minimal footprint area on the order of a few @xmath1m@xmath76 ( see , e.g. , the inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) . in practice , this is significantly smaller than current heralded sources fabricated with the same soi technology and based on coupled resonator optical waveguides @xcite or spatially multiplexed photonic crystal waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also stress the generality of the proposed scheme , which could be extended to other types of nonlinearities @xcite , and could eventually lead to the realization of novel quantum devices @xcite for applications in integrated quantum metrology and logic .    in summary , by combining an extremely low input power , a small footprint area , and no quantum emitter required for single - photon generation , </S>",
    "<S> such a device might have significant impact on the development of integrated silicon quantum photonics , by introducing a new concept in the generation of pure quantum states of light at arbitrary wavelengths ( e.g. , in the telecom band ) , that is fully compatible with current semiconductor technology , working at room temperature , and a viable alternative to single - photon nonlinear devices based on cavity - qed with artificial atoms or single atomic - like emitters that are presently lacking in soi integrated platforms .     </S>",

    "<S> a description of this quantity and an estimation for the photonic crystal cavities considered here are given in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> starting from this hamiltonian , the various time - dependent photon correlation functions for light collected after cavity 1 , generally defined as @xmath79 were numerically simulated by using both the montecarlo wave function method and by directly solving the master equation for the density matrix ( see details in supplementary information ) . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solutions were computed on a truncated hilbert space of dimensions @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the maximum photon occupations allowed in cavities 1 and 2 , respectively . </S>",
