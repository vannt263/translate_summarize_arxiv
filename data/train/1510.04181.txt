    ", @xmath14 refers to the supremum norm , and we set @xmath15 and @xmath16 where the latter space is composed of all real valued and bounded functions on an arbitrary index set @xmath17 .",
    "a metric space @xmath17 is _ injective _ if for every metric space @xmath12 and every @xmath0-lipschitz map @xmath18 defined on a subet @xmath19 there exists a @xmath0-lipschitz extension @xmath20 .",
    "basic examples include the real line ( @xmath21 yields a maximal @xmath0-lipschitz extension ) and all @xmath22 spaces for arbitrary index sets ( as the maps may be extended component - wise ) and ( @xmath23-)trees . also , every @xmath0-lipschitz retract @xmath24 of an injective space @xmath25 is itself injective since @xmath26 may first be extended to @xmath27 and then concatenated with the retraction @xmath28 .",
    "a metric space @xmath17 is called an _",
    "absolute @xmath0-lipschitz retract _ if for every isometric embedding @xmath29 into another metric space @xmath25 there exists a retraction of @xmath25 onto @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , every injective space @xmath17 is an absolute @xmath0-lipschitz retract since the identity on @xmath25 restricted to @xmath30 extends to a @xmath0-lipschitz retraction .",
    "conversely , every space @xmath17 embeds isometrically into @xmath31 via the kuratowski embedding @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the map @xmath34 , and is therefore injective if it is a @xmath0-lipschitz retract .",
    "thus these two notions coincide , and injective spaces are geodesic , contractible , and also never empty ( as we allow @xmath35 in the definition above ) .    by a remarkable theorem of isbell  @xcite",
    ", every metric space @xmath17 possesses an _ injective hull _",
    "@xmath36 ( unique up to isometry ) which is minimal among injective spaces containing an isometric copy of @xmath17 in the following sense .",
    "there is an isometric embedding @xmath37 with the following property . whenever there is a metric space @xmath38 and a @xmath0-lipschitz map @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is an isometric embedding , then @xmath41 is an isometric embedding as well",
    "however , we do not need this definition in the sequel and now review just as much of isbell s construction @xmath42 as necessary for our purposes .",
    "given a metric space @xmath17 , we denote by @xmath43 the vector space of arbitrary real valued functions on @xmath17 and put @xmath44 a function @xmath45 is called _ extremal _ if there is no @xmath46 in @xmath47 other than @xmath48 .",
    "the set @xmath36 can equivalently be written as @xmath49 thus @xmath48 is extremal if and only if for every @xmath50 and @xmath51 there is a @xmath52 such that @xmath53 applying the equation defining the members of @xmath36 twice , we obtain @xmath54 for all @xmath55 , so every extremal @xmath48 is @xmath0-lipschitz . from the definition of @xmath56",
    "we see that every function therein is non - negative everywhere .",
    "thereof it follows easily that all the functions @xmath33 for @xmath57 are extremal and , moreover , are the only extremal functions with zeros .",
    "isbell then goes on to show that the set of extremal functions is in fact an injective hull of @xmath17 .",
    "we will not demonstrate that here as we only need the following fact used in lemma  [ lem : a4 ] .",
    "if @xmath17 is injective , then the only extremal functions are @xmath58 . in order to show this , assume the existence of an extremal @xmath48 that is not equal to any @xmath33 for @xmath57 , in particular @xmath48 has no zero .",
    "now let @xmath59 be the disjoint union of @xmath17 and a single point @xmath60 .",
    "the metric @xmath61 on @xmath59 shall be @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the distance from @xmath50 to @xmath60  and the properties of a metric hold as @xmath65 and @xmath48 is @xmath0-lipschitz and positive .",

    "so the convergence of @xmath131 is like that of a geometric series .",
    "it remains to check that @xmath132 .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that the sets @xmath133 are closed and the subsequences @xmath134 ( convergent to the same limit as @xmath131 ) lie completely in these sets .",
    "so the limit lies in the intersection of all the sets @xmath135 and this is exactly @xmath1 .",
    "the proof does not work with @xmath136 since the sequence @xmath131 need not be convergent as the example @xmath137 shows .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 can be empty . but even assuming @xmath8 ( change @xmath138 to @xmath139 in the example ) the sequence can be divergent , and it is of no help to subtract a convergent subsequence ( which , in the case @xmath8 , always exists ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can show the lemma to hold for @xmath140 assuming @xmath8 .",
    "recall that for two non - empty subsets @xmath141 of some metric space @xmath17 the _ hausdorff distance _ is the real value @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes the closed @xmath144-neighborhood of @xmath11 . and",
    "this is a metric on the set of all closed , bounded , and non - empty subsets of a given metric space @xmath17 . for further information on this distance and the gromov - hausdorff convergence ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "[ lem : a3 ] for every @xmath89 let @xmath6 be a pair of @xmath0-lipschitz maps with @xmath7 .",
    "then the subspace @xmath91 is injective assuming either that all the maps @xmath145 are bounded ( hence again the system of inequalities is solvable automatically ) or that @xmath1 is non - empty ( requiring the existence of a solution ) .",
    "again , the lemma remains valid if any of the lower or upper bounds take the constant value @xmath92 or @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the bounded case first .",
    "let @xmath146 and @xmath147 be a lower bound for the maps @xmath148 and @xmath149 an upper bound for the maps @xmath150 .",
    "define @xmath151 and @xmath152 and observe that the maps @xmath153 for some fixed @xmath154 are all @xmath155-lipschitz .",
    "moreover , for every fixed @xmath71 the sequence @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) is monotonically converging down ( up ) to @xmath150 ( @xmath148 ) pointwise . define the sets @xmath158 which are injective by the first proposition .",
    "and we have @xmath159 as well as @xmath160 ( this already implies @xmath8 as all the @xmath161 are compact ) . if we can show that @xmath161 converges to @xmath1 w.r.t .",
    "( implying gromov - hausdorff convergence ) , then @xmath1 is injective  either see section  1.5 in @xcite or derive a direct proof of this easy special case here .",
    "so assume for some @xmath162 we would have @xmath163 for every @xmath154 ( first only for infinitely many @xmath154 but then for all by monotonicity of @xmath161 ) .",
    "then taking a convergent sequence @xmath164 one immediately gets @xmath165 leading to a contradiction .",
    "( in fact , this could also be derived from well - known theorems about hausdorff distance . )",
    "this ends the proof in the case of bounded maps    to reduce the case assuming @xmath8 ( with possibly unbounded @xmath1 ) to the previous one we refer to corollary  1.19 in @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that every proper metric space @xmath1 is injective if and only if every closed ball in @xmath1 is injective .",

    "\\text { for all } i \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last set above is injective by the bounded case , and we are left to show the second equality since the first one is clear . clearly , all three sets are contained in @xmath170 .",
    "for a point @xmath50 in that ball , we have @xmath171 and @xmath172 by our choice of @xmath173 .",
    "consequently , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and from this it is now obvious that the sets coincide .",
    "now we turn to the converse that every injective subset of @xmath3 can be written as a set of @xmath176 inequalities in the sense of the lemma above .",
    "we need a last definition before turning to the proof . by a _ cone _",
    "@xmath177 in a metric space @xmath17 we mean the set @xmath178 for cones of the form @xmath179 or @xmath180 , where @xmath181 are vectors of the standard basis of @xmath2 , we shorten the notation further to @xmath182 and @xmath183 . with @xmath184 being the euclidean orthogonality relation , we can equivalently write @xmath185    [ lem : a4 ] for every injective subset @xmath9 there are @xmath186 pairs of @xmath0-lipschitz maps @xmath6 ( @xmath89 ) with @xmath7 such that @xmath187 we allow for @xmath188 or @xmath189 ( or both ) for any @xmath71 which is equivalent to drop some of the inequalities .",
    "the injective subsets of @xmath190 are exactly the closed intervals .",
    "thereby the case @xmath191 is trivial or more a matter of declaring the convention @xmath192 , and so we assume @xmath193 .",
    "since @xmath1 is injective , only the distance functions @xmath194 for @xmath167 are extremal ( as shown in the preliminaries ) . therefore , given any point @xmath50 outside @xmath1 , the function @xmath195 is non - extremal .",
    "so we may assign to every such point the positive quantity @xmath196 ( from choosing @xmath167 such that @xmath197 we see that @xmath198 ) .",

    "assume that the @xmath71-th coordinate of @xmath204 has maximal absolute value among all coordinates ( if there are several such coordinates we simply choose one ) .",

    "observe that @xmath207 always .",
    "assume that @xmath208 contains a point @xmath173 and @xmath209 ( the case @xmath210 works the same way ) . a straightforward computation yields @xmath211 and hence @xmath212 and consequently @xmath213 but this violates the definition of @xmath199 if we choose @xmath214 .",
    "we do so and have @xmath215 for all @xmath202 . for every @xmath71",
