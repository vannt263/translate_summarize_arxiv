    "the equation of state ( eos ) has attracted a lot of attention recently for asymmetric nuclear matter , which can be described approximately by the parabolic law @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the isospin asymmetry , @xmath6 the energy per nucleon for symmetric nuclear matter , and @xmath7 the bulk symmetry energy .",
    "the symmetry energy term @xmath8 is very important for understanding many interesting astrophysical phenomena ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , but so far results in large uncertainties : _",

    "i.e. _ , when the density is higher than three times of the normal density , even a negative symmetry energy can be obtained . therefore , acquiring the more accurate knowledge of the symmetry energy , and the isospin asymmetry , becomes one of the main goals in nuclear physics at present .",
    "the recently available facilities of rare - isotope beams provide the opportunities to study the dynamical evolution of nuclear systems with a large range of isospin asymmetries , which increases the domain over which a spatially uniform local isospin asymmetry @xmath9 may be achieved .    in order to obtain the information about the symmetry potential at high density",
    ", the beam energy required has to be of higher than several hundreds of mev per nucleon , but then the isospin effects on heavy ion collisions would become negligible and are usually not considered .",
    "however , in some special cases , like the one around the particle emission threshold , it is found that the symmetry potential affects the particle production @xcite , especially , the ratio between the number of produced negatively and positively charged particles may depend sensitively on the density dependence of the symmetry potential .",
    "li @xcite found that , in an isospin - dependent hadronic transport model , the @xmath10 ratio , as well as the neutron - proton differential collective flow , were sensitive to the behavior of the nuclear symmetry potential at high densities .",

    "@xcite found that when the beam energy was higher than 2 agev the sensitivity of @xmath11 ratio to the form of the symmetry potential is largely reduced at high densities . in this paper , we attempt a further investigation of the energy dependence of the sensitivity of the @xmath10 production ratio to the form of the symmetry potential in the urqmd model . furthermore , we try to explore a new candidate in terms of the @xmath3 ratio for probing the symmetry potential in high density matter , which is in addition to the @xmath12 production ratio .",
    "the production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 hyperons is closely related to the neutron - proton asymmetry of the projectile - target system , which means that the symmetry potential of nuclear matter will affect the @xmath3 ratio .",
    "consequently , the @xmath3 ratio in heavy ion collisions at high energies may also carry the information about the density dependence of the symmetry potential of nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , the isospin - dependent part of the single - particle potential of @xmath1 hyperon in a nuclear medium , the , so called , lane potential , depends on the isospin asymmetry of nuclear matter , which might also influence the @xmath3 ratio . in turn , this study of @xmath3 ratio might provide us with the information about the isospin - dependent part of the @xmath1 hyperon single - particle potential .",
    "in this paper , the study of @xmath1 hyperon production is limited near its threshold ( 1.79 gev for @xmath1 hyperon production in free space through a process of the type @xmath15 reaction ) in order to observe the effect of the symmetry potential on the @xmath3 ratio . specifically , we consider the neutron - rich system @xmath16 and the nearly isospin - symmetric system @xmath17 at three different beam energies of @xmath18 ( the sub - threshold energy ) , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 gev . for our calculations ,",
    "the urqmd model @xcite , version 1.3 , is adopted , using the hard skyrme - type eos for reactions with beam energies @xmath21 gev .",
    "we find that most of the urqmd model calculations can simultaneously reproduce many experimental measurements , which offers a good platform for studying the isospin effects at sis energies .",

    "ii , we give our method of including the isospin - dependent part of the mean field in the urqmd transport model . in section iii ,",
    "the numerical results of pion and @xmath1 hyperon production and the corresponding ratios between the negatively and positively charged particles are presented .",
    "finally , in section iv , a brief summary and discussion are given .",
    "since the isospin dependence of nucleon - nucleon interaction has been introduced explicitly in the urqmd model , in order to study the isospin effects in heavy ion collisions , we have to introduce the symmetry potential into the mean field . in urqmd model , the skyrme and the yukawa potentials are included in the iso - scalar part of the mean field , where the yukawa parameter is related to skyrme parameters .",
    "in infinite nuclear matter , the contribution of yukawa potential to the total energy acts like the two - body skyrme contribution @xcite . the coulomb potential is also implemented explicitly .",
    "similarly , a symmetry potential should also be included in the mean - field part .",
    "the bulk symmetry energy @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ ieos ] ) can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the symmetry energy at the normal density and @xmath25 the reduced density . in this paper , we take @xmath26 mev and , in order to mimic the strong variation of the density dependence of the symmetry energy at high densities , we adopt the form of @xmath27 as used in @xcite : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the reduced critical density .",
    "note that when @xmath30 , the symmetry potential energy will be negative .",
    "similarly , following @xcite , we take @xmath31 for stiff symmetry potential ( stiff-sym.pot . ) , namely , the @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for soft symmetry potential ( soft-sym.pot . ) , namely , the @xmath34 .",
    "apparently , @xmath32 and @xmath34 give the two extremes of the symmetry energy at high densities , as is illustrated in the following for the chemical potential .",

    "furthermore , the curves of @xmath39 for @xmath32 and @xmath34 cross each other at @xmath40 ( called , crossing point ) and those of @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "apparently , such different behaviors of the @xmath35 , calculated with @xmath32 and @xmath34 , will strongly influence the motion of protons and neutrons and so also the time evolution of the proton and neutron density distributions , which will further influence the ratios of produced particles with different charges .    for simplicity , the isospin - independent part of the mean field for resonances and hyperons is taken here to be the same as that of the nucleon .",

    "however , the value of @xmath54 , even its sign , is still a matter of argument : within the relativistic mean - field theory ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the symmetry potential of the octet of baryons is described via the coupling between the baryon and @xmath55 meson . for hyperons ( @xmath56 ) ,",

    "[ fig7 ] ( right plot ) , firstly , one sees that the @xmath3 ratio is sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry potential for neutron - rich @xmath16 collisions , but insensitive to that for the nearly symmetric @xmath17 collisions . for @xmath16 at @xmath81 gev , the @xmath3 ratio calculated with the stiff symmetry potential is higher than the one with the soft symmetry potential . as the beam energy increases",

    ", it might be interesting to investigate why the behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath2 ratios is so different , as far as the influence of the density dependence of the symmetry potential is concerned .",
    "one basic difference is that , like nucleons , @xmath60 hyperons are under the influence of the mean field produced by the surrounding nucleons , as soon as they are produced .",

    "is increased to @xmath20 gev , the sensitivity to the density dependence of the symmetry potential is almost lost , like for the case of @xmath2 ratio ( not shown here ) .",
    "this means that the different behavior of the @xmath3 ratio , with respect to the @xmath2 ratio in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , is due to the introduction of the symmetry potential of @xmath1 hyperon .",

    "[ fig4 ] , it was shown that one of the most important channel for @xmath1 production is @xmath97 , where the most important channel is @xmath119 .",

    "in summary , based on the urqmd model ( version 1.3 ) , we have investigated the influence of the symmetry potential on the ratios between the negatively and positively charged pions and @xmath1 hyperons , in the nearly central collisions @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 gev energies . in order to find sensitive probes to the behavior of the symmetry potential at high - density nuclear matter ,",
    "two different forms of the density dependence of symmetry potential in the mean field are considered .",
    "the obvious dynamical effect of the symmetry potential is found on the neutron - rich reaction @xmath16 and not on the nearly isospin - symmetric reaction @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of the symmetry potential on the @xmath2 ratio in @xmath16 at @xmath81 gev is similar to that found in @xcite , namely , the @xmath2 ratio calculated with the soft symmetry potential is higher than that with the stiff one , but at higher energies , like @xmath89 gev , it disappears .",
    "this is explained as follows : at @xmath81 gev the most important channel for the production of pions is @xmath44 decay , while at @xmath89 gev other channels also play important role and the contribution from @xmath44 decay is largely reduced .",
    "the situation about the effect of the symmetry potential on @xmath3 is more complicated because @xmath1 hyperon itself also experiences a mean field of nuclear medium as soon as it is produced .",
    "when the symmetry potential of @xmath1 hyperons is not taken into account , a behavior similar to that of @xmath2 ratio is obtained , i.e. , the @xmath3 ratio calculated with the soft symmetry potential is higher than that with the stiff one at @xmath81 gev and the sensitivity to the symmetry potential disappears at @xmath89 gev .",
    "as soon as the symmetry potential of @xmath1 is introduced , the motions of @xmath66 and @xmath68 are also governed by the symmetry potential , in addition to the iso - scalar part of the single - particle potential .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath126 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where @xmath126 of @xmath66 is similar to that of neutron and that of @xmath68 is similar to that of proton ) drives @xmath66 ( @xmath68 ) to high ( low ) density area for soft symmetry potential and to low ( high ) density area for stiff symmetry potential , when the density is higher than the crossing density , and vice versa when the density is lower than the crossing density , though the effect is then much smaller .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath66 ( @xmath68 ) with soft symmetry potential possesses lower ( higher ) symmetry potential energy than that with stiff symmetry potential , when density is higher than the crossing density , and vice versa when density is lower than the crossing density . for the case of @xmath81 gev ,",
    "the time duration at high densities ( @xmath127 ) is much longer than the time when the most of @xmath1 hyperons are produced .",
    "therefore , the situation in this case is mostly like that of the case when the density is higher than the crossing density , i.e. , @xmath66 hyperons move to the high density area and @xmath68 hyperons move to the low density area for the soft symmetry potential .",
    "thus , with the soft symmetry potential , the annihilation of @xmath66 is enhanced and that of @xmath68 is reduced , compared with those with stiff symmetry potential . furthermore , the single - particle energy of @xmath66 with the stiff symmetry potential is higher than that with the soft symmetry potential , which leads to more @xmath66 hyperons emitted for the stiff symmetry potential case than for the soft one .",
    "finally , the @xmath3 ratio with the stiff symmetry potential may exceed the one with that of the soft symmetry potential . on the other hand , for the case of @xmath89 gev , the duration time at high density is much shorter , as is also the case for the @xmath1 hyperons produced at high densities .",
    "also , the nuclear density reduces quickly and the most of @xmath1 hyperons after their production will experience the situation with the density being lower than the crossing density .",
    "consequently , the @xmath3 ratio with the soft symmetry potential may exceed as compared to that with the stiff symmetry potential .",
    "this kind of energy dependence of the behavior of the @xmath3 ratio with respect to the symmetry potential is completely due to the dynamical effect of the symmetry potential of @xmath1 in nuclear medium , which allows us to understand why the behavior of the @xmath3 ratio is different from the @xmath2 ratio .",
    "however , there exists a large uncertainty about the single - particle potential of @xmath1 , especially the symmetry potential , so that the results presented here may not be accurate quantitatively . however , all the features about the energy dependence of the relative values of the @xmath3 ratios , corresponding to the different forms of the density dependence of the symmetry potential , should not change . these features are also useful for us to extract the information about the symmetry potential of @xmath1 hyperon .",
