    "the case for cosmic ray acceleration at supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks has found increasing support in observational evidence , both from the thermal and non - thermal components of the emission from these objects .",
    "the production of relativistic electrons has been clearly established from the non - thermal x - ray emission detected from several shell - type snrs , e.g. , sn 1006 @xcite , rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , and vela jr .",
    "@xcite . additionally , the dynamical properties of some snrs suggest that a significant fraction of the explosion energy is going into the acceleration of ions to relativistic speeds , like in the case of 1e 0102.2 - 7219 @xcite .",
    "x - ray measurements of the relative positions of the forward and reverse shocks , and contact discontinuity in tycho s snr also indicate modification of the remnant dynamics by the acceleration of cosmic - ray ions @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-ray emission in the tev range from some snrs , observed with ground - based telescopes , seems to confirm that particles are indeed being accelerated to energies approaching the _ knee _ of the cosmic ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , there is growing debate as to whether the origin of this high energy emission is hadronic or leptonic in nature , as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "pion production , followed by @xmath3 decay , is a natural result of the interaction of relativistic ions , like those generated through diffusive shock acceleration at snr shocks , with dense material @xcite .",
    "hence , snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds present particularly interesting targets for the detection of @xmath0-ray emission of hadronic origin , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detection of hydroxyl ( oh ) masers at 1720 mhz is a very useful tool for finding this type of interactions , as they indicate the presence of shocked clouds of dense molecular material @xcite .",
    "observations in the mev to gev range are especially important in order to identify signatures of @xmath1-decay , because the photon spectrum from this process has a distribution that peaks approximately at 70 mev @xcite .",
    "the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) , on board the compton gamma - ray observatory , found a host of discrete @xmath0-ray sources in the gev band possibly associated with galactic snrs @xcite .",
    "however , due to poor spatial resolution and other instrumental constraints , it has proven impossible to determine unambiguously the origins of these egret sources . the large area telescope ( lat ) , onboard the _ fermi gamma - ray telescope _ has opened a new window for studying snrs in the gev energy range , due to its improved sensitivity and resolution .",
    "for example , the detection of an extended lat source coincident with snr w51c ( g49.2 - 0.7 ) , was reported by @xcite , and their study suggests that @xmath1-decay emission is the dominant component of the @xmath0-ray flux observed in its direction .",
    "the observation of oh maser ( 1720 mhz ) emission in the direction of this snr , reported by @xcite , suggests that it is interacting with a cloud of dense material .",

    "<S> we report the detection of @xmath0-ray emission coincident with four supernova remnants ( snrs ) using data from the large area telescope on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope_. g349.7 + 0.2 , ctb 37a , 3c 391 , and g8.70.1 are snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds , as evidenced by observations of hydroxyl ( oh ) maser emission at 1720 mhz in their directions . </S>",
    "<S> snr shocks are expected to be sites of cosmic ray acceleration , and clouds of dense material can provide effective targets for production of @xmath0-rays from @xmath1-decay . </S>",
    "<S> the observations reveal unresolved sources in the direction of g349.7 + 0.2 , ctb 37a , and 3c 391 , and a possibly extended source coincident with g8.70.1 , all with significance levels greater than 10@xmath2 . </S>"
