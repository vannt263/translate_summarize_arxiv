    "a microlensing event occurs when a stellar mass object passes between the observer and a background source . for events in the local group ,",
    "the source is a star .",
    "if the source is finite , rather than infinitely small , parts of the source may be magnified more than other parts . in the case of stars , for example",
    ", the limb can be brightened relative to an unmagnified source .",
    "since the light from the limb comes from different temperature profiles in the star compared to the center , this will affect the spectrum for example , a spectrum of the limb of the sun has balmer lines with weaker wings , while lines of other elements can be either weakened or strengthened relative to the center @xcite .",
    "recently , observers using large telescopes have published abundance ratios in dwarfs in the galactic bulge from spectra obtained while the sources were highly magnified . a number of these have turned out to have super - solar metallicities , including ogle-2006-blg-265s @xcite , moa-2006 - 0blg-099s @xcite , ogle-2007-blg-349s @xcite , moa-2008-blg-310s and moa-2008-blg-311s @xcite and ogle-2007-blg-514s @xcite . some are metal - poor including the subgiant ogle-2008-blg-209s @xcite and the dwarf ogle-2009-blg-076s @xcite , which , at [ fe / h]@xmath6 is the most metal - poor dwarf / subgiant observed when microlensed . for a sample of eight microlensed dwarfs",
    ", @xcite found that a k - s test gave a 1.6% chance that the dwarfs were drawn from the same metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) as the giant mdf from @xcite .",
    "@xcite report results for a total of 13 dwarfs , including new results for more metal - poor dwarfs , so clearly the comparison between the giants and the dwarfs is an evolving topic .",
    "@xcite proposed that mass - loss on the giant branch prevents some more metal - rich stars from becoming red giants , similar to the mechanism suggested by @xcite to explain the low - mass he white dwarfs in the metal - rich cluster ngc 6791 .",
    "however , this explanation predicts that the red clump mdf is biased to more metal - poor stars because of metal - rich stars skipping the horizontal branch phase and that the red giant luminosity function should drop more than expected from theoretical models , predictions that do not agree with the giant data @xcite .",
    "another explanation is that there are systematic differences between giant and dwarf abundance analyses .",
    "@xcite calculated that a systematic offset of 0.10 dex between the dwarf and giant metallicity scales would give the mean metallicity offset a significance of 2-@xmath7 and larger systematic offsets would obviously decrease the significance further still . finally , @xcite suggested that the spectra of microlensed dwarfs could be affected by differential magnification sufficiently that the usual analysis of the dwarfs , which does not take this into account , could lead to biased answers and help explain the possible discrepancy .",
    "this last suggestion can be tested by comparing the answers obtained from synthetic spectra with and without differential limb magnification .",
    "while most microlensing events follow the lightcurve of a point source , about @xmath83% @xcite of events show finite source effects .",
    "this fraction is even higher for high - magnification events that are targets of the current generation of dwarf studies .",
    "of the eight published events for which dwarf spectra were obtained , we know that at least three of the events were affected by finite source effects , namely ogle-2007-blg-514 , ogle-2007-blg-349 , and moa-2008-blg-310 . we need to determine the size of the effect that differential limb magnification ( dlm ) has on the spectra and the measurement of the effective temperature ( t@xmath0 ) , gravity ( log @xmath2 ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , microturbulent velocity ( @xmath4 ) and abundance ratios to correctly interpret these events .",
    "in addition to probing the chemical evolution of the bulge , the accuracy of the measured t@xmath0 from the spectrum is important for testing the method by which colors of source stars in microlensing events are determined . using a metallicity and a t@xmath0 derived from the spectrum",
    ", we can predict the color of the star using relations between color and t@xmath0 , such as that by @xcite , and compare with the color estimated using standard microlensing techniques , which rely on the offset of the star from the red clump .",
    "the results so far indicate that if the color of the red clump is @xmath9=1.05 , the t@xmath0s derived spectra are in agreement with t@xmath0s from colors .",
    "much work has been done on the effects of dlm of the disk of giants during a microlensing event because these events are easier to find and are longer - lasting than similar events in dwarfs .",
    "@xcite predicted the effects on the spectrum of a giant , in particular the h@xmath10 and co lines , by fitting simple analytic expressions to the limb profiles for both continuum and lines from the @xcite models .",
    "he found that the equivalent widths could change by 20% over the course of the event . @xcite computed more realistic models avoiding the use of linear approximations .",
    "they calculated contribution functions for lines , which indicate where the lines are formed , and illustrated the range of behavior individual spectral features will have because of varying center - to - limb profiles .",
    "@xcite pointed out that binary lens events had particular advantages for resolving stellar surfaces , for example the fact that the second caustic crossing can be predicted if the event is monitored , and therefore carefully observed .",
    "thanks to intensive monitoring by observers , the effect of the size of the source on microlensing events has been observed many times .",
    "finite source effects were observed for the giant macho 95 - 30 @xcite , including variations in the equivalent widths of h@xmath11 and the tio bands .",
    "the bulge k3 giant star eros blg-2000 - 5s was highly magnified by a binary lens . because the caustics of a binary lens are symmetric ,",
    "the timing of the second caustic crossing was predicted to high accuracy and allowed intensive follow - up during this event .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found decreases in the strength of the h@xmath11 line when the limb was more highly magnified relative to the center .",
    "@xcite monitored the same event photometrically , measured the color of the limb , and found that the outer 4% of the limb showed strong h@xmath11 emission , which they ascribed to the presence of a chromosphere .",
    "@xcite performed the first limb - darkening measurement of a bulge giant for the event macho 1997-blg-28 , using photometry in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands .",
    "other limb - darkening measurements were done for giants including macho 1997-blg-41 @xcite , and ogle-2002-blg-069s @xcite , which the authors found agreed with a linear limb - darkening law .",
    "an opposite result was found by @xcite who obtained photometry for the k giant ogle-2004-blg-254s and derived limb darkening coefficients in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands . combining these results with other microlensed - based limb darkening measurements of k giants and comparing them to the predictions of atlas9 models",
    ", they found a disagreement , which they suggested was the result of the inadequacy of the linear limb darkening law .",
    "time - resolved spectra of ogle-2002-blg-069s , a g5iii star , by @xcite , showed the power of this technique for probing the stellar atmosphere . in this case , the changes during the event in wings of h@xmath11 line , which are formed deep in the atmosphere , agreed with model predictions while the core of the line showed an emission peak , which again can only be explained by a chromosphere .",
    "that the temperature structure in the outer layers is not well understood for this event was also found by the analysis of @xcite .",
    "these studies show the potential to investigate the atmospheric structure of giants .",
    "studies of dwarf stars have been much rarer .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported the only measurements of limb darkening in dwarfs , for macho 98 smc-1 , a main - sequence a star and moa 2002-blg-33s , a solar - type star , respectively . the most relevant work to this paper is the analysis of @xcite of the event macho 96-blg-3 .",
    "they took three exposures when the source , a dwarf star , was moving across a caustic . these r@xmath81100 spectra with signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of 25 - 100 did not show any convincing cases of profile variability . @xcite compared the observations of this star with both a library of high - resolution , high s / n spectra of f and g stars observed at calar alto and a grid of synthetic spectra , and derived stellar parameters of t@xmath0=6100k from the h@xmath11 line , log @xmath2=4.25 from the triplet and a metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) between 0.3 and 0.6 from fits to regions with many and lines .",
    "they calculated the expected deviations from the unmagnified spectrum for this event , and found that the expected change in the line profiles for the three spectra was @xmath15 1% , while the expected change in the continuum was @xmath15 2% .",
    "given the small changes expected and the s / n of the spectra , it is not surprising that no changes were observed , and that the derived atmospheric parameters of the star would also not be affected .",
    "indeed , it is not surprising that most changes are small .",
    "the amount of magnification depends on the distance from the lens , but the emitted spectrum is the same for an entire annulus ( for a spherical star ) . because the distance from the lens varies around the annulus , the average magnification of a spectrum at a particular annulus is smaller than the largest magnification of an particular spot would suggest .",
    "in addition , while the spectrum of the star increasingly changes from center to limb , the intensity of the limb is lower than the center , by factors of a few .",
    "therefore it is difficult to overcome the influence of the light coming from the central regions of the star in the disk - averaged light .",
    "the work discussed above focused on learning about the atmosphere of the star and showed that finite source effects cause changes in the spectrum of the star , which can be inverted to give temperature as a function of depth . because the same effects that make these extreme events interesting as probes of the atmosphere will also change the spectrum that is analyzed for elemental abundances , the goal of this paper is to determine the effect of dlm on the t@xmath0 , @xmath4 , log @xmath2 , [ fe / h ] and abundance ratios using the standard spectroscopic techniques , such as equivalent width analysis",
    "therefore , we will be concerned with mimicking standard abundance analysis as closely as possible , rather than exploring the full range of knowledge that can be gleaned from time - resolved spectroscopy of microlensed events .",
    "our work was motivated by two events , moa-2008-blg-310 and ogle-2007-blg-514 , which are illustrations of the kind of effects seen . for moa-2008-blg-310 ,",
    "the lens did in fact transit the source , and there were small perturbations during this transit caused by a planetary companion in the lens @xcite .",
    "however , the spectrum analyzed by @xcite began at ut 22:51 , which was 21 minutes after the end of the transit , when the lens and source center were separated by @xmath16 source radii .",
    "figure  [ fig : moa310 ] shows the annulus - averaged profiles for a point lens at 15 minute intervals for the moa-2008-blg-310 geometry , beginning at @xmath17 and continuing as the lens and source moved further apart .",
    "the magnification is given as a function of @xmath18 , which is the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight to the observer .",
    "to determine this look at the later stages of moa-2008-blg-310 will be referred to as event a. the start time for the first profile is three minutes before the @xcite observations began , and thus serve as a direct measurement of the size of the effect of dlm on those abundances , but they also serve a broader purpose .",
    "more than the center.,width=302 ]    in this particular case , we know that @xmath16 at the time of the observations because the source size was earlier detected by observations ( from africa ) of a direct source crossing .",
    "however , if the closest separation between source and lens during the entire event ( i.e. , the impact parameter ) had been @xmath19 , there would have been no source crossing at any time .",
    "if the impact parameter is sufficiently large , then it becomes impossible to determine the source radius from the lightcurve .",
    "in such a case , only upper limits can be placed on the magnitude of dlm and profiles of the dlm as a function of @xmath18 can not be derived .",
    "however , for @xmath20 , the effects of the finite - source size on the light curve are sufficiently pronounced to measure @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the top curve in figure  [ fig : moa310 ] represents the most extreme case of dlm that would occur without being noticed , and thus serves as a _",
    "general _ check on ignoring dlm when it is not detectable from the light curve .",
    "the other case represents a more extreme event , inspired by ogle-2007-blg-514 , and will be called event b. here , the source trajectory crossed a cusp from a binary lens and produced extreme magnification variations ( figure  [ fig : traj ] ) .",
    "once the parameters are selected , it is straightforward to compute the magnification at each time and for every point on the source plane .",
    "we calculated the mean magnification in concentric rings with annuli equal to 0.01 source radii using the `` loop - linking '' technique @xcite .",
    "the profiles are spaced at five minute intervals for this event .",
    "actual observations are always longer , usually 5 - 6@xmath22 longer in order to get enough s / n in each exposure to reliably extract the spectrum .",
    "spectra at 5 minute intervals could only be obtained for dwarfs magnified to apparent magnitudes that have not been seen in an event to date , so in reality microlensing spectra will smear out these profiles and dilute their effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : ogle514 ] shows 51 different profiles that occurred during this event .",
    "we note that in this case we have ample notice from the lightcurve that finite source effects are important and we could use that information to derive the magnification profile at the time spectra were taken and make model spectra that include the effects of dlm .",
    "however , in this paper , we consider the cases that ignored finite source effects on the spectrum to measure the size of errors that this induces on the parameters , metallicities and abundance ratios .        .",
    "we see in the most extreme cases that parts of the disk are magnified up to 5@xmath22 more than other parts .",
    "the two profiles that are examined in more detail in the text are for time step 18 ( bold line peaking at @xmath23 ) and time step 35 ( bold line peaking at @xmath24),width=302 ]",
    "we explored the changes to the spectra of dwarfs caused by the magnification profiles given in  2 .",
    "we interpolated a set of model atmospheres from the kurucz - castelli grid with new opacity distribution functions ( @xcite . the models are solar - metallicity and are spaced every 100 k from 5000k to 6200k .",
    "this temperature range covers the range of temperatures for dwarfs observed in the bulge .",
    "cooler dwarfs ( @xmath25 k ) are unlikely to ever be targeted because of their intrinsic faintness and because if the dwarfs are as cool as the giants , many of the advantages of measuring abundances in dwarfs rather than giants ( such as reduced blending ) no longer apply .",
    "although the majority of the bulge population is old @xcite , we wanted to explore a large temperature range of main - sequence / main - sequence turnoff stars , and therefore we adopted log @xmath2 values from a yale - yonsei isochrone @xcite of 4 gyr . at this age , stars with t@xmath0=6000k have two possible values for log @xmath2 , because they are at the turnoff , while dwarfs with 6100k and 6200k are still present because of the blue hook in the isochrone .",

    "the changes are small , but vary from line - to - line based on the location of the line - forming region . in general , the strong lines , including h@xmath11 and h@xmath10 , become weaker for profiles 35 and 1 , for which the limb is magnified relative to the center , while the reverse is true for the spectrum from profile 18 .",
    "the opposite behavior is seen for most of the weak lines .",
    "as expected , the deviations are largest for the two cases where the magnification profile is more extreme and much smaller for event a , where the differential magnification effects were @xmath29 , rather than @xmath30 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the practical effect of finite source effects on abundance measurements in microlensed dwarfs . to do this",
    ", we followed the usual steps used to analyze these spectra . because differential reddening across the face of the bulge leads to uncertainty in the colors and magnitudes of stars in the bulge ,",
    "analyses of microlensed dwarfs have relied on spectroscopic methods of deriving atmospheric parameters , rather than color or apparent magnitude - based methods .",
    "dlm can impact the derived abundances in the source star by changing the ews of the lines and by changing the atmospheric parameters derived from those ews . to examine these effects and compute the total effect of dlm on the abundances , we first measured ews in the synthetic spectra for the unmagnified case and profiles 18 , 35 and 1 .",

    "looking at the changes in each parameter separately shows the size of the effect if only some of the parameters are determined from the spectra .",
    "however , because deriving the atmospheric parameters usually depends on the other parameters , we next consider the total effect of the accumulated atmospheric parameter changes plus ew changes . once again , depending on the line list used , different correlations between the parameters may be found , but the overall tendencies can be generalized .      in measuring ews on the model spectra",
    ", we encountered the same concerns about continuum placement and blending as in measuring ews on observed spectra .",
    "because of our desire to determine differences caused by differential limb magnification , we focus on measuring ews in a consistent manner .",
    "we first used iraf to do the continuum division , keeping the parameters of the fit , such as the order of the polynomial and the high and low - reject sigmas , the same for both magnified and unmagnified spectra .",
    "then we measured the ews without adjusting the continuum interactively , using spectre ( c. sneden , 2007 , private communication ) to fit gaussian profiles to the spectra .",
    "our initial linelist was selected using the solar atlas of @xcite as a guide to unblended lines , but this was not completely foolproof at the lower resolution ( compared to the solar atlas ) of the synthesized spectra , and over the large temperature range spanned by the models .",

    "any line that deviated by more than 0.1 dex from the mean is eliminated .",
    "also eliminated are lines with ew @xmath31m in the unmagnified case , because these lines are usually eliminated in high - resolution analysis due to their sensitivity to damping parameters , continuum placement , blending in the wings and incorrect temperature structure in the outermost layers of the model atmospheres .",
    "for each temperature , the same lines were measured for each magnification profile ; however , because the strength of lines varies with temperature , the linelist changes for different temperatures . because the same transition information , such as @xmath32-value , was used both to synthesize the spectra and to calculate the abundance , there are no uncertainties introduced in this process by atomic data uncertainties .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ew5000 ] , we compare the difference in ews for the three magnification profiles under study . we find that , as expected , the smaller differences between limb and center for profile 1 result in smaller changes in the ews . as seen in figure 4 ,",
    "weaker lines are mostly strengthened and strong lines mostly weaken for profile 35 , while the opposite is true for profile 18 .",
    "this emphasizes the point that the magnitude of the changes for a particular analysis will depend on the distribution of ews that are being used .",
    "we then ran the ews through turbospectrum , using the original model atmosphere .",
    "this comparison isolates the effect of the ew changes on the abundances , before we consider changes caused by new atmospheric parameters , and would reflect the total changes if the analysis relied on non - spectroscopic methods for atmospheric parameter determination , such as color of the unmagnified star for t@xmath0 and position on the cmd for gravity .",

    "this is consistent with the magnification profiles for these two cases , because profile 18 has the center , where we see to hotter temperatures , magnified more than the limb , while the opposite is true for profile 35 .",

    "this is appropriate when one model atmosphere parameter is chosen independently of the others .",

    "as these are interpolated models to begin with , these changes will never be that precisely determined .",
    "we note that the metallicity of the model atmosphere will have an effect on the abundances . however , the changes in log@xmath34(fe ) based on lines , which is how the metallicity of the atmosphere is usually set , are small enough that we will ignore this last effect for the purposes of the paper . for example , the change of 0.02 dex in for the 5600k model with profile 35 would lead to a subsequent change for 0.006 dex in if folded back into a new model .",

    "also , the changes in abundances are not always in the same sense .",

    "as stated in the introduction , the emphasis on high magnification events means that in many cases there will be dlm when the spectra are taken . our ability to determine the effect on the spectra from observations falls into four different possibilities : 1 ) the lightcurve is indistinguishable from a point source and dlm is truly negligible ; 2 ) the lightcurve is indistinguishable from a point , but dlm occurs ; 3 ) the lightcurve shows extended source effects , which also means that dlm occurs ; 4 ) there is no photometric data for crucial parts of the event . of these possibilities ,",
    "the first means that the spectrum can be analyzed using standard spectroscopic techniques , while the third can either be analyzed with standard techniques , leading to errors of the order presented here , or analyzed using spectra with the dlm derived from the lightcurve .",
    "it is cases 2 ) and 4 ) that are of the most concern for ensuring reliable abundance results .",
    "case 2 ) is fully addressed by event a , which illustrates the maximum dlm that is possible without giving rise to noticeable effects , given a well - covered light curve . case 4 ) , i.e. , poor light curve coverage , must be handled on a case - by - case basis . to date , all microlensing events with spectra have had adequate photometric coverage .",
    "microlensing of bulge dwarfs provides the exciting opportunity to obtain high s / n and high - resolution spectra of stars that otherwise would be unfeasible with current telescopes .",
    "however , microlensing can produce finite source effects that affect the spectra by differentially magnifying annuli in the star compared to an unmagnified star .",
    "we have examined the practical impact of such dlm by synthesizing spectra of dwarfs with magnification profiles similar to events that have been observed and performing an abundance analysis .",
    "we find that , as expected , there are changes to the spectrum , which results in changes in the atmospheric parameters , metallicities and abundance ratios . given the small size of the changes , the s / n of the observed spectra and the accompanying error in the atmospheric parameters , and the length of the exposures compared to the duration of a specific magnification profile , the resulting effect on the abundances is small compared to other sources of error .",
    "we note that the change in abundances can be either positive or negative ( see profile 35 vs. profile 18 ) depending on the form of the magnification profile .",
    "microlensing events are more commonly in the shape of event a , with mild magnification causing limb brightening , so there will be a tendency for events to be biased to lower metallicity , but figure 11 shows that event a leads to changes of @xmath37 dex in metallicity . these results , combined with the fact that finite source effects do not affect all of the high - magnification cases for which",
    "dwarfs have been observed , demonstrate that this is not the cause of any differences between the observed metallicity distribution function for giants and dwarfs .",
    "finally , if the lightcurve shows even more extreme finite source effects than have been modeled in this paper , magnification profiles for that event can be constructed and model spectra calculated that appropriately take those profiles into account , so this will not be a limiting problem for the accuracy of abundances derived for microlensed dwarfs ."
