    "<S> nernst effect has been measured for an underdoped and an optimally doped @xmath0 single crystal with the magnetic field applied along different directions . for both samples , when @xmath1 c , a significant nernst voltage appears above @xmath2 and keeps measurable up to a high temperature ( 100 k ) as reported by xu et al . </S>",
    "<S> [ nature 406 , 486(2000 ) ] . however , when @xmath1 a - b plane the nernst signal drops below the noise level quickly above @xmath2 for the underdoped sample . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the in - plane nernst data with field at different angles shows a nice scaling behavior with the c - axis component of the field . </S>",
    "<S> all these give strong indication for strictly in - plane vortex - like excitations in pseudo - gap region .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the puzzles in high temperature superconductors is the origin of a pseudogap above @xmath2 in underdoped region . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it is clearly seen@xcite that some electronic density of states ( dos ) near the fermi surface is depleted below the pseudogap temperature @xmath3 which is much higher than @xmath2 . in order to understand the physics behind the pseudogap , </S>",
    "<S> many models have been proposed , such as resonating valence bond ( rvb ) @xcite theory and its bosonic version called phase string theory@xcite , spin fluctuation@xcite , preformed cooper pairs@xcite , charge stripes@xcite , d - density wave ( ddw)@xcite , etc . among many of them , the pseudogap state has been considered as the precursor to superconducting state . in this precursor state , </S>",
    "<S> composite bosons , such as holons or pairs of electrons have been formed before the long range phase coherence ( or bose - einstein like condensation ) is established . </S>",
    "<S> measurements on the high frequency complex conductivity illustrate that a short - life phase coherence can persist up to about 30 k above @xmath2 in the short time scale and the ultra - fast electrical response can be described by the thermally generated topological defects ( free vortices ) in that phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar conclusions are drawn in understanding the coherent peak of arpes@xcite and the ( @xmath4 ) magnetic resonance peak at 41 mev in inelastic neutron scattering@xcite in the pseudogap region . by doing thermal measurement , </S>",
    "<S> the princeton group found that a significant nernst signal@xcite appears in the pseudogap region with h@xmath5 c. this may be understood by the phase - slip due to the thermal drifting of vortex - like excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still unknown whether this excitation should be strictly in - plane and how the direction of the external field influences this excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , given the formation of cooper pairs above @xmath2 , it is desirable to know whether the superconducting condensation occurs simultaneously with the coherent motion of cooper pairs along c - axis </S>",
    "<S> . presumably there are two major pictures . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is that a finite phase stiffness in the superconducting state is established by the binding of the topologically generated vortex - antivortex pairs@xcite . in this frame </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is corresponding to the kosterlitz - thouless transition and is not necessarily related to the c - axis coherent motion of quasi - particles or cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> another one is that the condensation occurs by establishing the coherent motion of cooper pairs between layers , i.e. , the interlayer tunnelling model ( ilt)@xcite . the ilt model assumes that the driving force for the pairing and thus the condensation ( in the frame of bcs picture ) is the reduction of kinetic energy when holes recover the c - axis coherent motion at @xmath2 , thus the condensation energy and the josephson coupling energy should be equal . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present data of nernst effect near and above @xmath2 in underdoped and optimally doped @xmath6 single crystals with the magnetic field aligned in different directions . </S>",
    "<S> our results prove a strictly in - plane vortex - like excitation above @xmath2 and the superconducting condensation occurs simultaneously with the coherent motion of cooper pairs along c - axis in underdoped region .     at temperatures ranging from ( a)10 k to 50 k ; and ( b ) 40 k to 150 k. a background from the normal holes ( electrons ) is shown by the data of 120 k and 150 k. both the magnitude and the temperature region for the nernst signal is very similar to that reported by xu . </S>",
    "<S> et al.@xcite ]    single crystals measured in this work were prepared by the travelling solvent floating - zone technique . in this letter we present the measurements for two typical single crystals , one underdoped ( x = 0.09 , @xmath7 ) and another one optimally doped ( x = 0.15 @xmath8 ) as characterized by ac susceptibility and dc magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the qualities of our samples have also been characterized by x - ray diffraction patterns showing only ( 00l ) peaks , rocking curve showing a full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) of ( 008 ) peak being narrower than 0.10 @xmath9 , the rbs channelling minimum yield being only @xmath10=0.038 , and resistive measurement showing a rather narrow transition width @xmath11 1.5 k.    for measuring the nernst effect we adopted the one - heater - two - thermometer technique . </S>",
    "<S> a heating power of 1 - 4 mw is applied to one end of the single crystal and two tiny thermometers with distance of 1.5 mm are attached to the sample for measuring the temperatures along the heat flow ( longitudinal ) direction . </S>",
    "<S> the nernst voltage is measured through two contacts on two opposite planes at the symmetric positions ( shown by inset in fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> very small contacting resistance ( @xmath12 ) has been achieved by using silver paste . </S>",
    "<S> both samples are shaped into a bar structure with dimensions of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements are based on an oxford cryogenic system ( maglab-12 ) with temperature stability better than 0.01 k and magnetic field up to 12 tesla . during the measurement for nernst signal the magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> is swept between 7 to -7 tesla and the nernst signal @xmath14 is obtained by subtracting the positive field value with the negative one in order to remove the faraday signal during the field sweep and the possible thermal electric power due to asymmetric electric contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the nernst voltage is measured by a keithley 182-nanovoltmeter with a resolution of about 8 nv in present case . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show the nernst signal @xmath15 , where @xmath16 with @xmath17 the distance between the two contacts for nernst voltage , @xmath18 is the temperature gradient along the heat flow direction .    in fig.1(a ) we present the nernst voltage @xmath19 vs. external magnetic field ( @xmath20 ) for the optimally doped sample at temperatures ranging from 10 k to 50 k. it is clear that in low temperature region with a vortex solid state , @xmath19 is too small to be measurable below 7 tesla ( see the curve at 10 k ) . at 15 k , when h is above 5 t , the nernst signal appears and rises showing a pronounced vortex motion . </S>",
    "<S> the onset field for the appearance of @xmath19 is corresponding very well to the irreversibility line measured on the same sample in the magnetization measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the signal @xmath19 first rises ( see , e.g. , 20 k and 25 k ) and then drops gradually when the temperature is further increased ( see , e.g. , 30 k , 35 k , 40 k and higher ) . for a conventional superconductor , below @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the nernst signal should first increase , reach a maximum and then decrease and finally drop to zero near @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> wang et al.@xcite measured the nernst effect in high field region and find that the upper critical field @xmath22 extends to a much higher temperature and field region , especially for underdoped samples . from our data </S>",
    "<S> one can also see that at 50 k , @xmath23 is still in the uprising branch which agrees with the basic idea about a high @xmath21 of wang et al.@xcite the data for temperatures higher than @xmath2 are shown in fig.1(b ) . just as reported by xu et al.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a significant nernst signal is observed far above @xmath2 . from our data here @xmath19 is measurable up to about 100 k where it approaches the background signal evidenced by almost identical values measured at 120 k and 150 k. similar phenomenon occurs for the underdoped sample ( x = 0.09 ) which reveals a sizable nernst signal up to about 120 k. as forementioned this significant signal was attributed@xcite to the vortex - like excitations in the pseudogap region . both the general magnitude and the temperature region for the measurable nernst voltage when @xmath24 on our crystals are close to that found by xu et al.@xcite indicating an unambiguous repeatable experimental discovery .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0@xmath9 ( squares ) , 25@xmath9 ( circles ) , and 50@xmath9 ( triangles ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the in - plane nernst signal can be well scaled with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> all data are subtracted with the background at 150 k. the inset shows the configuration of our measurement , where a , b and c correspond to the crystalline axes . ]    in order to know whether this normal state nernst signal is due to an in - plane vortex - like excitation , we now turn the direction of the magnetic field away from c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> the angle between the magnetic field ( always in the a - c plane ) and c - axis is @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration of the measurement is shown as an inset in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath19 is contributed by strictly in - plane vortex - like excitations , it should be scalable when @xmath26 is changed . </S>",
    "<S> the data collected at temperatures ranging from 40 k to 90 k and @xmath27 are shown in fig.2 . because from 40 k to 90 k it is found that @xmath28 , in order to expose the scaling quality of the data at different temperatures , here we show @xmath29 vs h , which should be the same as @xmath19 vs h@xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the three set of data corresponding to three angles can be well scaled together at each temperature . </S>",
    "<S> although the nernst voltage can be written in a general way @xmath31 , it is not naturally true that @xmath14 is strictly proportional to @xmath32 since the pre - factor @xmath33 here is also @xmath26 dependent . </S>",
    "<S> one can expect that @xmath14 is strictly proportional to @xmath32 only when the system is isotropic or strictly 2d in nature , since otherwise the vortex core size , shape and the motion viscosity coefficient will depend on @xmath26 , leading to a angle dependence of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be proved by the failure of scaling the data below @xmath2 in the flux flow region where the moving pancakes are connected by josephson vortices . </S>",
    "<S> nice scaling obtained here above @xmath2 shows that the in - plane nernst signal depends only on the c - axis component of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this shows a strong evidence that the normal state nernst signal is induced by strictly in - plane vortex - like excitations .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the situation when @xmath34 plane and @xmath19 is measured along c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> for the underdoped sample ( x = 0.09 ) , it is found that the nernst signal when @xmath20 behaves very similar like that shown in fig.1(a ) and ( b ) for the optimally doped sample , i.e. , a significant signal @xmath19 appears up to a high temperature (   120 k ) . for brevity , </S>",
    "<S> the data is not shown here . however , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath34 plane , the situation becomes very different . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , as shown in fig.3 , it is clear that below @xmath2 , the signal @xmath19 becomes much smaller than that when @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood with different vortex structure and dynamics in these two different cases . at @xmath20 , the vortex system </S>",
    "<S> are composed by pancake vortices which are connected by josephson vortices . the dissipation induced by flux flow due to thermal gradient </S>",
    "<S> is mainly contributed by vortex pancakes . </S>",
    "<S> since these pancake vortices have much smaller volume as well as smaller collective pinning energy @xmath35 , the motion is relatively easier comparing to the case with @xmath34 . when @xmath34 plane , the josephson vortex is driven to move by the thermal drifting force </S>",
    "<S> .     plane . </S>",
    "<S> the signal in the superconducting state is much smaller than that when @xmath36 . remarkably , the nernst signal vanishes quickly above @xmath7 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> each josephson vortex lies in between two neighbor cu - o planes and threads through a large part or even the whole sample . due to the squeezing effect by the supercurrent in neighboring planes , the vortex size along the moving direction is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the penetration depth along c - axis </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath39 is the anisotropy of the mass matrix elements along ab plane and c - axis ( @xmath40 1/20 for lsco ) . because of this special structure </S>",
    "<S> , the moving speed of these josephson vortices is relatively lower leading to a smaller nernst signal . besides </S>",
    "<S> , in fig.3 , one can see another remarkable point that the signal @xmath19 drops abruptly to zero ( the background @xmath41 v ) when the temperature is just above @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing of @xmath19 above @xmath2 is certainly not due to the relatively smaller signal in the superconducting state at @xmath34 since a clear step rather than a gradual manner appears near @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> , squares ) and the optimally doped sample ( @xmath42 , circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line represents the noise level of our measurement . ]    in order to have a closer inspection , in fig.4 we present the nernst signal at 6 t for @xmath20 and @xmath34 at different temperatures for two samples@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that @xmath14 can be measurable up to about 100 k when @xmath20 , but it drops below the noise level at about 35 k which is only 5 k from @xmath2 when @xmath34 . if the sizable signal @xmath14 measured below @xmath2 reflects the motion of the josephson vortices when @xmath43 plane , the vanishing @xmath14 above @xmath2 may suggest that superconducting condensation is established almost simultaneously with the josephson coupling along c - axis . since josephson coupling is fulfilled by the coherent motion of cooper pairs along c - axis , </S>",
    "<S> it is also tempting to conclude that the superconducting condensation occurs simultaneously with the coherent motion of cooper pairs along c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> similar conclusion was drawn in earlier infrared reflectivity ( ir ) measurements by tamasaku et al.@xcite who observed a sharp reflectivity edge which was attributed to josephson plasma resonance . however , beyond the earlier ir data , the present results show clear evidence for in - plane vortex - like excitation@xcite which implies the existence of preformed pairing far above @xmath2 . in this scenario the ilt model may be modified in the following way : the superconducting condensation ( in underdoped region ) occurs by lowering the kinetic energy of the cooper pairs which are inhibited to move along c - axis above @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total condensation energy has two contributions : reduction of kinetic energy of cooper pairs below @xmath2 and the energy reduction due to pairing above @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this picture naturally explains why the josephson coupling energy as observed in some systems , such as , tl-2201 , is smaller than the total condensation energy determined from specific heat measurement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar picture is proposed by chakravarty et al.@xcite who argued that the condensation energy can not be precisely defined since the normal state is not a fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this picture calls for further quantitative theoretical consideration </S>",
    "<S> .    in conclusion , beside a strong nernst signal observed for underdoped and optimally doped samples above @xmath2 when @xmath20 , for the first time a general scaling for the nernst signal vs. c - axis component of the magnetic field is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the underdoped sample the nernst signal vanishes abruptly just above @xmath2 when @xmath43 plane showing that the superconducting condensation is established simultaneously with the josephson coupling ( or the coherent motion of cooper pairs ) along c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> both observations strongly suggest the existence of strictly in - plane vortex - like excitations . </S>"
