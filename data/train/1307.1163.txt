    "gene fragmentation and dispersal of fragments are found in various organisms ranging from euglenozoa ( found in kinetoplastids , euglenoids , and diplonemids ) to alveolates ( found in apicomplexa , ciliates , and dinoflagellates ) .",

    "gene fragmentation occurs when the rna is not made from a single precursor , derived directly from the genome , but it is reconstituted from different rna sources .",
    "this can also happen without dispersal , _",
    "i.e. _ spreading the genes for these rna parts over the genome , intermingled with other genes .",
    "rna editing , first used to refer to rna alteration processes in trypanosomatids , entailing extreme mitochondrial ( mt ) gene fragment dissemination , was discovered in 1986 ( benne _ et al .",
    "_ , 1986 ) .",
    "trypanosomatids are parasitic unicellular organisms belonging to the kinetoplastid order .",
    "kinetoplastids are characterized by a kinetoplast , the strongly staining location of _ all _ the mt dna molecules within their _ single _ mitochondrion .",
    "kinetoplastid rna editing refers to post - transcriptional sequence alteration via insertion and deletion of uridylate residues at specific sites of mt rnas .",
    "trypanosomal mt rnas are encoded by two types of mt dna molecules : several thousand small minicircles and a few dozen maxicircles ( scott , 1995 ; simpson and thiemann , 1995 ; simpson _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; madison - antenucci _ et al . _ , 2002 ) .",
    "maxicircles contain ribosomal rna genes and genes mostly encoding subunits of respiratory chain complexes .",
    "many subunit genes need editing upon transcription .",
    "both kind of circles encode guide ( g ) rnas necessary for editing of maxicircle encoded rnas ( blum _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) .    very extensive",
    "editing is illustrated by the _ trypanosoma brucei _",
    "cox3 gene .",
    "cox3 is easily found ( _ e.g. _ by looking at homologies ) in _ crithidia fasciculata _ and _ leishmania tarentolae _ : the transcript undergoes limited editing ( _ e.g. _ in _ c. fasciculata _ only 32 us are inserted and 2 us deleted at 14 sites ) .",
    "the _ t. brucei _",
    "cox3 gene was identified later : its transcript has to be edited overall ( feagin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ) .",
    "while the g , a and c nucleotide sequence is maxicircle derived , the u nucleotide sequence is generated by editing , using minicircle encoded grnas , with @xmath0 us inserted and @xmath1 us deleted at @xmath2 sites .",
    "the transcript derived from the gac sequence ( called the cryptogene ( simpson and shaw , 1989 ) ) has less than half the edited size .    in _",
    "t. brucei _ , most of the mt encoded proteins come from such cryptogenes ( @xmath3 out of @xmath4 , with @xmath5 unedited and @xmath6 partially edited transcripts remaining ) .",
    "the extensive editing of cryptogene transcripts is known as pan - editing ( simpson and shaw , 1989 ; sturm and simpson , 1990 ) .",
    "the precise molecular mechanisms of editing , using sequential basepairing between grnas and mrna , are described in ( schnaufer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) and references therein ( madison - antenucci _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ; blum _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ; feagin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ; simpson and shaw , 1989 ) .",
    "the consequence of pan - editing is that information necessary for production of ( some ) proteins is spread and mixed over the entire mt dna .    here",
    ", we propose a mathematical model to support the concept ( speijer , 2006 ; speijer , 2007 ) that such gene fragment dispersal can function as a biological adaptation preventing gene loss caused by intense intraspecific competition , due to selection on growth rate in limited spaces ( _ e.g. _ a host ) .",
    "the process lowers the chance that rapidly growing deletion mutants replace _ all _ the more complex , ecologically versatile , organisms , as large deletions will contain linked active segments .",
    "it thus works to preserve by association. to put it another way : mt gene scattering prevents the translation of short - term advantages into long - term disaster .",
    "our model describes the ` life cycle ' of the mt genetic material of a trypanosomatid . in the absence of functional selection",
    "we do not distinguish between competition at the levels of individual mt genomes ( _ e.g. _ maxicircles ) and whole organisms . at the molecular level",
    "small circles outcompete larger circles by faster replication while at the level of the organism , organisms carrying less mt dna can also grow faster . _ at both levels mt deletions will be selected then : they even reinforce each other .",
    "_ we need to include the following parameters to determine the relationship between some of them :    1 .",
    "population size ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 individuals ; 2 .",
    "deletion size ( @xmath9 ) ; 3 .",
    "probability of a deletion ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 ; 4 .",
    "level of fragmentation / editing ( @xmath12 ) ; 5 .",
    "number of generations in each environment ( in the case of parasites ` host ' ) ; 6",
    ".   replication advantage of smaller dna ( @xmath13 ) ; 7 .",
    "confidence parameter ( @xmath14 ) that governs the level of approximation in our second simulation .    as mitochondrial dna polymerases are much more error - prone than their nuclear counterparts ( see ( larsson , 2010 ) and references therein ) ,",
    "a value of @xmath11 for the deletion probability is not unrealistic .",
    "we first model the process of replication and deletion in its most general form , and then simplify it , to enable us to simulate for realistic values of our parameters . in all our simulations , we assume there are two environments , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath15 , tsetse fly and @xmath16 , human host .",
    "a sequence @xmath17 of base pairs of length @xmath18 is necessary for survival in @xmath15 and a sequence @xmath19 of length @xmath20 is needed in @xmath16 , but not in @xmath15 . for simplicity we excluded sequences needed in both ( violet segments in figure 1 ) .",
    "total length of mt dna will therefore be @xmath21 base pairs .",
    "we chose @xmath18 to represent @xmath22 and @xmath20 @xmath23 of total mt dna ( @xmath24 basepairs ) .",
    "we assume the parasite to be in environment @xmath15 .    the level of mt dna fragmentation for an individual parasite is simply modelled as follows .",
    "the fragmentation and spreading that pan - editing of rna entails , intertwines subsequences of @xmath17 and @xmath19 modelled by the sequence @xmath25 .",
    "we assume the dna and hence this sequence to be circular , so that @xmath26 connects with @xmath27 , and we call @xmath28 the level of fragmentation . initially ,",
    "length of subsequence @xmath29 is @xmath30 and length of subsequence @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "we model replication rounds , in which for every round , with probability @xmath10 , deletion of dna with random length @xmath9 , at a random position , may occur .",
    "any deletion in an @xmath17 sequence is lethal .",
    "surviving individuals replicate such , that the smaller their total dna , the faster they replicate .",
    "this advantage ( given as an increased representation in the next round ) is modelled by a function @xmath13 .",
    "for example , a complete deletion of @xmath23 ( @xmath20 ) of the dna will translate in a @xmath33 stronger representation in the next generation .",
    "the process is modelled using a markov chain approach , with simplifying assumptions described in the appendix .",
    "we study the value @xmath34 monitoring the expected number of generations until no individuals are left with @xmath19 of length @xmath20 .",
    "any individual , missing part of @xmath19 , can not survive in the ` next ' environment ( @xmath16 ) anymore .",
    "the increase of @xmath35 gives us the added protection that additional fragmentation ( @xmath12 ) brings . at level @xmath12",
    "we have @xmath36 many states in our markov chain ( see appendix ) .",
    "realistically , @xmath20 is set around @xmath37 base pairs and @xmath38 can be over @xmath39 , making the markov chain too big to handle .    by exploiting symmetries and simplifying our model we approximate our markov chain , obtaining a manageable model that we can simulate for realistic values of @xmath20 and @xmath12 .",
    "an additional feature of this approximation is parameter @xmath14 , the confidence level , which allows us to smoothly interpolate between the simplified and the original markov chain .",
    "varying @xmath14 suggests that already for small values we obtain accurate approximations of the original process .",
    "see appendix and figure 2 .",
    "in a first simulation ( see figure 1b ) we decided to compare our highly simplified genome with and without a fragmented gene ( @xmath40 ) under partially relaxed selection ( when only part of the genome is needed ) with concomitant strong ( intraspecific ) competition .",
    "we simulated a modest ( _ e.g. _ in the bloodstream much less of the mt genome is needed ) situation in which most ( @xmath41 ) of the mt dna is still necessary for survival ( environment @xmath15 : tsetse ) .",
    "starting with @xmath8 individuals , we look at the number of generations needed to reduce the amount of individual organisms that have retained ecological flexibility ( _ i.e. _ they still contain all genetic information to be able to make the switch to another part of the life cycle ) to @xmath42 . without any fragmentation : after @xmath43 generations no organism has the possibility to switch to the next stage of the life cycle . with @xmath42 split : no such individual is left after @xmath44 generations ( values obtained starting with @xmath43 individuals : @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively ; with @xmath47 individuals : @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . see the table below :    @xmath50    the allowed generation time under periods of partially relaxed selective pressure has been extended by more than @xmath51 .",
    "we next altered the simple simulation by using a fixed deletion size for gene fragments ( instead of allowing the full range of sizes of our previous model ) while at the same time making it more informative by varying the amount of gene fragmentation ( @xmath12 , see figure 1c ) .",
    "this ( full markov chain ) simulation gave a surprising result : we obtained a direct , _ quasi - linear _ correlation between the degree of dispersal / fragmentation ( @xmath12 ) and the number of generations after which a complete population loses ecological competence ( see figure 2 ) . in other words , the function @xmath34 has an almost linear growth rate .",
    "a triatomine bug ( the insect vector used by _ trypanosoma cruzi _ ) will contain on average @xmath52 parasites ( kollien and schaub , 1998 ) ; while a bite with the tsetse fly will transmit @xmath53 ( mean , @xmath54 ) _ t. brucei _ infective metacyclics , giving rise to over @xmath8 parasites in a vervet monkey ( _ chlorocebus pygerythrus _ ) at peak infection ( ( thuita _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) and references therein ) .",
    "we chose populations of @xmath55 , @xmath8 and @xmath56 parasites in our simple modelling ( see the table ) and @xmath8 for our full markov chain approach . under the parameter values of our model",
    "the size of the population does not seem of major importance ( cf the table ) .",
    "we chose to model @xmath57 of the total mt dna in use , and @xmath58 free from functional selection ( for trypanosomatids in mammalian hosts , much less mt dna seems essential ) . doubling time in mammals",
    "can be @xmath59 hours if unimpeded by immune responses , while infections can be sustained for months .",
    "thus , our model should look at effects over many generations . in our basic approach",
    "we compare only two instances ( no split and only one split ) , but allow all possible deletion sizes . in the full markov chain approach we use an approximation ( depending on @xmath14 ) allowing us to model random deletions of varying sizes .",
    "because we have modelled optimal dissemination ( always strictly intermingling constitutively used and conditionally used regions ) , we tentatively infer that the fragmentation values of figure 2 are relevant below @xmath60 .",
    "recall that the _ complete _ _ t. brucei _ required set of grnas for _ all _ lifecycles is about @xmath60 ( hong and simpson , 2003 ) .",
    "surprisingly , only @xmath61 rapid passages ( at least @xmath62 generations ) in mice of tsetse fly infective _ t. brucei",
    "_ already gave rise to a homogeneous population of parasites that could no longer infect the insect and did not display mt ( oligomycin sensitive ) atpase activity anymore ( hajduk and vickerman , 1981 ) , demonstrating rapid takeover by mt dna mutants .",
    "these mutants in the end indeed _ divided more rapidly _ than the wildtype in blood but did not contain large scale mt deletions .",
    "this could of course be explained by the fact that certain parts of the present - day highly dispersed mt genome are still necessary and thus protect against large scale deletions under these circumstances , as described by our model of selection for linkage .",
    "takeover by deletion mutants could thus have been even faster , as mt replication times are possibly limiting when doubling every @xmath59 hrs .",
    "this also means ( cf .",
    "figure 2 ) that at a fragmentation level of between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , deletion mutants would contribute about as much to depletion of the wt population as all other inactivating mutations ( @xmath65 generations ) . for _ t. brucei _ we would expect a fragmentation level of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which seems realistic .",
    "however , all _ t. brucei _",
    "parameter values are very difficult to estimate in real life , because :    1 .",
    "it is not known precisely how little mt dna is essential in the mammalian host , 2 .",
    "population sizes and generation time estimates are complicated by waves of parasitemia , reflecting the immune response to alternating variant surface glycoprotein expression . very limited mt function and repeating population bottlenecks could explain why _",
    "t. brucei _ has the most extensive editing observed ( see below ) .    a further conclusion , shedding light on another point of contention ( landweber , 2007 ; speijer , 2008 ) : physical linkage of all mt genes is not essential for the model to work .",
    "this aspect is important when considering the cox1 gene in the parasitic diplonemid _ diplonema papillatum _ apparently split up in @xmath68-bp fragments , located on individual unlinked dna circles ( marande _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) and the existence of minicircles with only one grna in certain trypanosomatids ( though often physically linked ) .",
    "as the modelling makes clear , it is only reducing the chance of large deletions giving replication advantages which is essential . losing a substantial fraction of -one grna encoding- minicircles ( a large deletion ) will still compromise viability directly , regardless of _ physical _ linkage .",
    "networks themselves did probably evolve to make takeover by ( deletion ) mutants even less likely ( borst , 1991 ) .",
    "we model fragment dissemination as advantageous to parasites ( speijer , 2006 ; speijer , 2007 ) , but others defend ` neutral ' models ( such as constructive neutral evolution ( covello and gray , 1993 ; gray _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) ) ; see ( lukes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ; speijer , 2010 ; lukes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ; flegontov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ; speijer , 2011 ) .",
    "parasitism is not essential for our model to function : any free - living ancestor in periodically changing environments adapting its mt function could favour mt gene fragmentation when encountering strong intraspecific competition",
    ".    quickly changing environments could also be at the basis of the glycosome ( hannaert _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; gualdron - lopez _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "rapidly changing oxygen levels would lead to either aerobiosis with mt respiration or anaerobiosis with glycosomal activity for energy generation in non - parasitic ancestors . for these ancestors ,",
    "the lack of selective pressure on the mt genome has been invoked as the raison detre for rna editing before ( cavalier - smith , 1997 ) .",
    "the fact that novel kinetoplastids and diplonemids have been found in anoxic deep - sea basins recently , make such an ancestor more likely ( lara _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ; edgcomb _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ) . indeed , despite corrections to the kinetoplastid phylogenetic tree ( moreira _ et al",
    "_ , 2004 ; katz _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) , _ pan - editing is still seen as ancestral _ , originating 500 to 700 million years ago ( lukes _ et al . _ , 1994 ; fernandes _ et al . _ , 1993 ) .",
    "kinetoplastids are part of the euglenozoa ( with diplonemids and euglenoids ) .",
    "interestingly , another form of mt gene fragmentation occurs in the _ diplonemid d. papillatum _ ( marande _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; marande and burger , 2007 ) , as described above .",
    "transcript editing has become less extensive in more recently evolved species ( _ e.g. _ compare cox3 editing in _",
    "l. tarentolae _ and _ c. fasciculata _ with its pan - editing in _ t. brucei _ ) .",
    "editing loss results from reverse transcription of ( almost completely ) edited rna followed by homologous recombination of the cdna with mt dna .",
    "the 5 and 3 homology requirements of the cdna would sometimes result in a need for 5 editing of the new transcript encoded by the mt dna upon recombination .",
    "this is actually seen in cox3 and cytb in _",
    "l. tarentolae _ and _ c. fasciculata _",
    "( landweber , 1992 ) .",
    "another nice example of recent editing domain length reduction during cryptogene evolution is found in the nd8 gene of three related insect trypanosomatids , _ again strongly suggestive of correlations between life cycle complexity and editing extent _ ( see below ; gerasimov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "pan - editing entails a lot of extra complexity and energetic costs , so losing it is indeed what one would indeed expect , as soon as reduction of life cycle complexity allows it .",
    "in 1993 covello and gray ( covello and gray , 1993 ) introduced a general model for the evolution of different rna editing forms .",
    "rna editing activity is first acquired by ( a combination of ) pre - existing enzymes .",
    "mutations at editable nucleotide positions in the genome occur next .",
    "later on , editing becomes essential after fixation by a chance process in which an altered form replaces the original without a selective advantage . in the case of kinetoplastid editing this model could in principle explain the emergence of a few limited editing instances , but it is very hard to envisage how it explains the rapid acquisition of multiple instances of pan - editing with hundreds of grnas .",
    "this model does not identify selective pressure(s ) responsible for an _ active _ increase of editing potential .",
    "this pressure was postulated to reside in the fact that gene scattering could protect against loss of temporarily non expressed mt genes during periods of intense intraspecific competition ( speijer , 2006 ) , by warding off large deletion mutants outcompeting wildtype kinetoplastids ( see above and figure 1a ) .",
    "thus , ecological flexibility is retained , allowing kinetoplastids to occupy highly diverse ( parasitic ) niches and undergo extensive speciation ( cf .",
    "the repeated evolution of _ t. brucei _ strains that can not infect their insect vectors anymore ( lun _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) ) .",
    "pan - editing seems an effective way of making large deletions improbable .",
    "it necessitates presence of _ all _ cognate small grnas ( containing information for the u sequence ) to express a cryptogene ( encoding the gac sequence ) .",
    "these ` gene fragments ' colonize mt dna so that every random large scale deletion will now contain some information still under selective pressure ( speijer , 2006 ; speijer , 2007 ) .",
    "the following observations fit our model .    1 .",
    "especially transcripts encoding gene products which are crucial in all life cycle stages should be prone to pan - editing ( such as atp6 and rps12 , encoding components of the _ t. brucei _",
    "mt f1fo atpase and ribosome respectively ) .",
    "it is exactly because they are always required that fragmenting their genes with concomitant spread of cognate grna genes in mt dna leads to efficient mt dna integrity checkpoints. 2 .",
    "the role of grnas as such mt dna integrity checkpoints can also be performed by evenly distributed trna genes .",
    "e.g. _ trna genes in human mt dna ( anderson _ et al . _ , 1981 ) and _ e. coli _",
    "s multiple rrna operons distributed in such fashion ( blattner _ et al . _ , 1997 ) .",
    "however , exceptionally , all trypanosomatid mt trna genes are absent , mt trnas coming from the cytoplasm ( hancock and hajduk , 1990 ) .",
    "3 .   there seems to be a clear correlation between life cycle complexity and amount of pan - editing , _ i.e. _ gene fragment dissemination ( see above and _ e.g. _ ( gerasimov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "_ t. brucei _ , with its highly complex life cycle , still encodes a cox iii cryptogene , much reduced in length ( see above )",
    ", so its loss in the mammalian host would be less advantageous .",
    "much more importantly , its dispersed grna segments protect parts ( encoding nadh dehydrogenase subunits ) of the genome not used in the fly ( speijer , 2006 ; speijer , 2007 ) .",
    "thus , gene fragmentation implicit in mt rna editing can be seen as an instance of a general tendency to evenly distribute genetic information over the genome . in this way",
    "large scale deletion of pieces released from selection becomes impossible , no longer threatening ecological flexibility .",
    "our modelling demonstrates that the number of generations a population retains individuals with a full mt genome complement increases quasi - linearly with increases in rna editing ( _ i.e. _ with its concomittant gene scrambling ) .",
    "it thus allows _ positive selection of small , incremental increases of editing potential _ under the appropriate circumstances ( _ e.g. _ less frequent environment - host exchange ) .",
    "constructive neutral evolution , ignoring evolvability aspects tries to explain pan - editing as resulting from genetic drift and population bottlenecks only , but our model explains both its rapid spread and current patterns .",
    "these patterns correlate not only with a history of population bottlenecks , but _ specifically with alternating selection pressures on mt dna _ ( speijer , 2006 ; gray _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ; lukes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ; flegontov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ; speijer , 2011 ) .",
    "every time kinetoplastids readjust to different environments , founder effects can occur .",
    "the observed rapid speciation and development of unexpected , weird biochemical properties could then be a natural result .",
    "such founder effects might explain acquisition of ( limited ) rna mt editing / gene fragmentation in euglenozoa ( walker , 2007 ) in the first place .",
    "the kind of selection described here would then quickly give pan - editing in lineages with alternating mitochondrial demands .",
    "present - day kinetoplastids show an enormous diversity in mt dna : maxicircles of up to 200 kb , grna encoding minicircles of 1 - 3 kb with only one to several grna genes , and 200 kb circles possibly encoding hundreds ( simpson _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; maslov and simpson , 1994 ; blom _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "minicircles clearly evolved later , possibly in response to coding capacity demands of pan - editing .",
    "this increased mt dna size and led to networks combating minicircle loss ( borst , 1991 ) .",
    "as mentioned , over time editing becomes less extensive in some kinetoplastids ( landweber , 1992;gerasimov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) , reflecting the complexity and overall burden of the elaborate editing system .",
    "we have modelled mt gene scrambling , matching it with observations regarding the frequency of pan - editing and the ecology and population sizes of trypanosomatids in which it occurs .",
    "important modelling parameters include : the population size , the deletion size ( as a percentage of total genome size ) , the probability of a deletion in each new generation and the replication advantage value for a deletion .",
    "the outcome for every simulation was the number of generations after which no viable individual was left .",
    "we took the _ t. brucei _ lifecycle to deduce fixed values , only varying population size and amount of gene fragmentation .",
    "population size did not seem a major determinant .",
    "our output correlated extent of fragmentation / dispersal and increase in number of generations retaining ecological competence , which turned out to be a quasi - linear function .",
    "the fragmentation value of _ t. brucei _ mt dna seems to be in the range suppressing large scale deletion population takeover . to prevent such takeover , condemning parasites to die with their host ,",
    "a gene architecture of tremendous complexity evolved .",
    "it links survival of genes released from selection pressure to survival of genes still under such control .",
    "thus , while fragmentation reduces efficiency it seems to enhance long term ecological success .",
    "we are currently looking at gene fragmentation of _ plasmodium falciparum _ ( feagin _",
    "et al . _ , 2012 ) and ciliates ( nowacki _ et al . _ , 2011 ) in light of this mechanism , with only the malaria parasite possibly fitting the mould .",

    "we assume there are two environments , in which the parasite lives .",
    "we call these @xmath15 and @xmath16",

    "the process of editing induces that the base - pairs of @xmath17 and @xmath19 are intertwined modeled as follows by the sequence @xmath72 .",
    "we assume that the dna and hence this sequence is circular , so that @xmath73 connects with @xmath74 , and we call @xmath12 the amount of fragmentation .",
    "moreover we assume initially that the length of each subsequence is the same : @xmath75 is @xmath76 and @xmath77 is @xmath78",
    ".      during each replication cycle deletion of dna may occur .",
    "we will model this by setting @xmath79 the probability that a deletion occurs .",
    "when a deletion occurs we model this by picking uniformly at random a point @xmath80 position @xmath81 on the cyclic dna and cut out a uniformly random chosen length @xmath82 .",

    "we start by describing the first .",
    "we use a markov chain to model our process , though the entries will not be probabilities since they can be larger than 1 . a markov chain is a graph @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the set of nodes corresponding to all the possible states of the parasite being alive : the sequences @xmath98 , with @xmath99 .",

    "the starting state of our process corresponds to all the individuals that have all their dna still present .",
    "this corresponds to the unit vector @xmath109 , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 . in other words we fix the first entry of our vector to correspond to the state where all the dna is still present .",
    "likewise entry @xmath100 corresponds to the fraction of individuals in state @xmath100 .      in order to model the replication process",

    "we now need to take into account the boundary conditions induced by the maximum population size of the parasites as follows .",
    "we would like to view @xmath121 and @xmath117 as the probability distributions over the state space .",
    "initially all the probability mass is on the full dna state and progressively this mass flows to other states .",
    "we can then interpret the multiplication of @xmath122 with the size of the maximum population @xmath7 , @xmath123 as the _ expected _ number of individuals that have dna corresponding to state @xmath124 after @xmath125 generations .",
    "this means that we have to renormalize our vector : @xmath126 in order to make it a probability .",
    "this completes one full generation step of our process , and in general : @xmath127since @xmath128 is a linear map , we may renormalize at the end , so that : @xmath129    note that implicit in @xmath128 is the value of @xmath12 , the fragmentation level , which we have omitted in our notation so far for simplicity .",
    "note that when @xmath130 grows so does the size of the markov chain .",
    "keeping track of this parameter we define for each @xmath12 : @xmath131 let @xmath132 be the maximum @xmath125 such that @xmath133 .",
    "the value @xmath134 tells us the expected number of generations until there are no individuals left that have their full dna , at a fragmentation level @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in the growth rate of this function @xmath132 .",
    "it is easy to see that at fragmentation level @xmath12 we have @xmath135 many states in our markov chain .",
    "typically the total size of the mitochondrial dna of type @xmath16 will be around @xmath136 base pairs and @xmath12 can be over @xmath39 .",
    "this means that for these values the markov chain becomes way too big to handle .",
    "we will first exploit some symmetries in our problem and then show how we can approximate the markov chain in order to obtain a more manageable formulation that we can simulate .",
    "since we are only interested in evaluating the first entry of @xmath137 , we do not need the information of the states @xmath98 with @xmath99 , we only need to keep track of how _",
    "many _ blocks we have of size @xmath138 .",
    "for example the starting state corresponds to the following tuple with @xmath139 entries @xmath140 ) , the first entry indicating how many blocks we have of size @xmath78 , the second how many of size one less and the last how many of size @xmath88 .",
    "following this convention , the fully depleted state becomes @xmath141 .",
    "so these are precisely the states @xmath142 such that @xmath143 .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the number of multi - sets of cardinality @xmath12 with elements taken from a finite set of cardinality @xmath144 .",
    "this multi - set coefficient is equal to @xmath145 and can be bound from below by @xmath146 .",
    "this second representation is significantly smaller than our initial set - up , but still too large for the range of parameters we are interested in .",
    "we therefore have to simplify our process further .",
    "we modeled a deletion of dna , by randomly picking a position @xmath147 in the ( circular ) dna and then remove a piece starting at @xmath148 of random length .",
    "individuals survived this deletion whenever only dna from within a b - block @xmath124 was deleted .",
    "we now simplify this as follows .",
    "fix a parameter @xmath14 , @xmath149 , which we will call the _ confidence level_. we will only keep track for each block @xmath124 whether it has size @xmath150 , with @xmath151 .",
    "whenever a random deletion left us with a block size @xmath152we set the block size @xmath153 , while keeping the probability of this event the same  , we approximate this and assume that @xmath20 is divisible by @xmath154 . ] .",
    "we thus give slightly more probability to deleting larger parts within block @xmath124 .",
    "we will see later that this change is not very significant .",
    "for example , setting @xmath155 , models that whenever a deletion falls within block @xmath124 , we completely remove block @xmath124 ( _ i.e. _ it will have size @xmath88 ) .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath156 we get back our old process .",
    "confidence level @xmath14 thus allows us to interpolate smoothly between the simplified process and the original process .    for confidence level @xmath14 , the states of our markov chain will be @xmath157-tuples @xmath158 such that @xmath159 .",
    "the first entry indicates the number of blocks that have size @xmath160 , the second entry describes the number of blocks that have size @xmath161 , and the last entry the number of blocks that have size @xmath162 .",
    "the number of states we have in our markov chain , with fragmentation @xmath12 at confidence level @xmath14 is equal to the number of multi - sets of cardinality @xmath12 out of a finite set of cardinality @xmath157 , which is @xmath163 .      here",
    "we will make precise the transition probabilities between any pair of states in our markov chain .",
    "given any state @xmath164 such that @xmath165 .",
    "the transition from @xmath100 to @xmath100 , _",
    "i.e. _ no deletion occurred , is labeled with @xmath166 , where @xmath13 is taken as in equation  [ eq : multiplication_factor ] with @xmath167 the size function adapted for these simplified states : @xmath168transition from @xmath164 to @xmath169 are only possible if there is an @xmath170 such that @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and for all the other indices @xmath173 the states are the same : @xmath174 .",
    "this guarantees that exactly one @xmath16-block of size corresponding to @xmath175 transforms , by means of a deletion , to a block of size corresponding to @xmath176 .",
    "the probability that this transition occurs turns out to be : @xmath177where @xmath178 is the number of ways one can transform a block of length corresponding to @xmath124 , i.e of length @xmath179 , to a block of length corresponding to @xmath180 , using the rule of rounding down described in section  [ sec : simplification ] . note that this number only depends on @xmath181 , and @xmath14 and not on @xmath124 .",
    "for example if @xmath182 and @xmath183 this corresponds to the number of ways one can delete a sequence of length @xmath184 up - to @xmath185 in a sequence of length @xmath32 , which is equal to @xmath186 in general this becomes @xmath187    in equation  [ eq : probability ] we divide by @xmath188 because each possible deletion has probability @xmath188 to occur at a fixed position and is of a fixed length .",
    "finally we multiply in equation  [ eq : probability ] with @xmath10 , the probability that a deletion occurs .",
    "we started by simulating our process with a confidence level of @xmath42 .",
    "this gives a state space of size @xmath189 with the corresponding simulation matrix of size @xmath190 .",
    "we ran the simulation with the following parameters : @xmath191 , total size of the mitochondrial dna is @xmath192 , with @xmath193 part being of type b. we set the maximum population size @xmath194 .",

    "<S> such dispersal prevents losing temporarily non expressed mitochondrial genes upon intense intraspecific competition , by linking non expressed fragments to parts which are still needed . </S>",
    "<S> we mathematically modelled protection against gene loss , due to the absence of selection , by this kind of fragment association . </S>",
    "<S> this gives ranges of values for parameters like scrambling extent , population size , and number of generations still retaining full genomes despite limited selection . </S>",
    "<S> values obtained seem consistent with those observed . </S>",
    "<S> we find a quasi - linear correlation between dispersal and number of generations after which populations lose genes , showing that pan - editing can be selected to effectively limit gene loss under relaxed selective pressure . </S>"
