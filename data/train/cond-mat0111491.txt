    "the dynamical mean field approximation ( dmfa ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) is a widely used formalism for many body systems . in many cases",
    "it well takes into account non - trivial effects of strong correlations and thermal disorder .",
    "in particular , for the double - exchange ( de ) model @xcite , where the exchange interaction between the core spins is mediated by mobile carriers , application of the dmfa to the description of ferromagnetic transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) resolved a long standing problem of the energy scale for the curie temperature @xmath0 of manganites .",
    "however , this application was restricted to the case where only thermal magnetic disorder is present in the model .",
    "thus , chemical disorder introduced by doping impurities , which is generic for the manganites and many other de systems , was ignored .",
    "it was shown however , that the concurrent action of the static and magnetic disorder is crucial for the the description of the quasi - particle and transport properties of the de systems @xcite .",
    "therefore the inclusion of static disorder into the dmfa scheme is actual .",
    "the present note is devoted to this task .",
    "consider the de model with random on - site energies .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electron hopping , @xmath3 is the random on - site energy , @xmath4 is the effective exchange coupling between a core spin and a conduction electron , @xmath5 is the vector of the pauli matrices , and @xmath6 are spin indices .",
    "we express the localized ( classical ) spin by @xmath7 with the normalization @xmath8 .    in a single electron representation",
    "the hamiltonian can be presented as @xmath9 the first is translationaly invariant , the second describes quenched disorder , and the third - annealed disorder .",
    "the dmfa , as applied to the problem under consideration , is based on two assumptions .",
    "the first assumption is that the averaged , with respect to random orientation of localized spins and random on - site energy @xmath10 , locator @xmath11 where @xmath12 can be expressed through the the local self - energy @xmath13 by the equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bare ( in the absence of the disorder and exchange interaction ) locator .",
    "thus introduced self - energy satisfies equation @xmath16 the system of equations ( [ local ] ) and ( [ cpa ] ) is very much similar to the well known cpa equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as generalized to the case when the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19 matrices in spin space @xcite .",
    "the system of equations however , is not yet closed .",
    "the averaging with respect to annealed disorder is principally different from the averaging with respect to quenched disorder .",
    "the second assumption of the dmfa is the prescription for the determining , in our case , the probability of a spin configuration self - consistently with the solutions of the eqs .",
    "( [ local ] ) and ( [ cpa ] ) . to formulate the dmfa equation for this probability , taking into account both kinds of the disorder ,",
    "let us start from the general formula for the partition function @xmath20 where @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the matsubara frequency and @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "the averaging over @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 all observables , in particular thermodynamic potential @xmath26 , should additionally be averaged over the realizations of the quenched disorder ; in particular @xmath27 the dmfa approximates the multi - spin probability @xmath28 as a product of one - site probabilities in such a way , that @xmath29 the result for the one - site probability reads ( for details of the calculation see ref .",

    "( [ rkky ] ) and ( [ rkky2 ] ) becomes even larger , due to the effects of localization , which are absent in the cpa .",
