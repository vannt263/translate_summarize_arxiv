    "recently there has been a growing interest in the possibility of producing disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc s ) in a high energy collision @xcite .",
    "this idea was first proposed to explain centauro events in cosmic ray emperiments where there was a deficit of neutral pions @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that a nonequilibrium chiral phase transition such as a quench might lead to regions of dcc @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite , we discussed in detail the time evolution of a non - equilibrium chiral phase transition in the linear @xmath0 model in the leading order in large - n approximation .",
    "we showed in that paper that the expansion into the vacuum of the initial energy distribution led to rapid cooling .",
    "this caused the system , initially in quasi local thermal equilibrium to progress from the unbroken chiral symmetry phase to the broken symmetry phase vacuum .",
    "this expansion is accompanied by the exponential growth of low momentum modes for short periods of proper time for a range of initial conditions .",
    "this exponential growth of long wave length modes is the mechanism for the production of disordered chiral condensates .",
    "thus the production of dcc s results in an enhancement of particle production in the low momentum domain . whether such an instability occurs depends on the size of the initial fluctuation from the initial thermal distribution .",
    "the relevant momenta for which this exponential growth occurs are the transverse momenta and the momenta @xmath5 conjugate to the fluid rapidity variable @xmath6 .",
    "we also found that the distribution of particles in these momenta had more length scales than found in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "when there is local thermal equilibrium , the length scales are the mass of the pion and the temperature which is related to the changing energy density , both of which depend on the proper time @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we reexpress our previous results in terms of the physically measurable transverse distribution of particles in the collision center of mass frame .",
    "we show that whenever dcc s are produced there is a noticable distortion of the transverse spectrum , namely an enhancement of particles at low transverse momentum , when compared to a local equilibrium evolution .",
    "we will consider two cases , one in which there is exponential growth of low momentum modes due to the effective pion mass going negative during the expansion , and one where the initial fluctuations do not lead to this exponential growth .",
    "both situations will be compared to a purely hydrodynamical boost invariant calculation based on local thermal equilibrium .",
    "the idea that the production of dcc s might lead to a distortion of the transverse distribution of pions is also found in the work of gavin and collaborators @xcite .",
    "however , our calculation is more realistic in that we exactly solve the field theory in a large @xmath1 approximation in the boost invariant approximation , using the expansion of the plasma as the cooling mechanism for producing instabilities . in determining the actual spectra of secondaries , we find that the adiabatic number operator of our large - n calculation replaces the relativistic phase space density @xmath8 of classical transport theory in determining the distribution of pariticles in rapidity and transverse momentum .",
    "this makes it easy to compare our results with a standard hydrodynamical calculation in the boost invariant approximation which assumes the final pions are in local thermal equilibrium in the comoving frame .",
    "the model we use to discuss the chiral phase transition is the linear sigma model described by the lagrangian : @xmath9 the mesons form an @xmath10 vector @xmath11 this can be written in an alternative form by introducing the composite field : @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 the effective action to leading order in large @xmath1 is given by @xcite @xmath14 = \\int d^4x [ l_2(\\phi,\\chi , h ) + { i \\over 2}n { \\rm tr~ln } g_0^{-1}]\\ ] ] @xmath15 ~\\delta^4(x - y)\\ ] ] varying the action we obtain : @xmath16 \\pi_i = 0 ~~~~ [ \\box + \\chi(x)]\\sigma = h,\\ ] ] where here and in what follows , @xmath17,@xmath0 and @xmath18 refer to expectation values . varying the action we obtain @xmath19 if we assume boost invariant kinematics @xcite which result in flat rapidity distributions , then the expectation value of the energy density is only a function of the proper time .",
    "the natural coordinates for boost invariant ( @xmath20 ) hydrodynamical flow are the fluid proper time @xmath7 and the fluid rapidity @xmath21 defined as @xmath22 to implement boost invariance we assume that mean ( expectation ) values of the fields @xmath23 and @xmath18 are functions of @xmath7 only .",
    "we then get the equations : @xmath24 to determine the green s function @xmath25 we introduce the auxiliary quantum field @xmath26 which obeys the sourceless equation : @xmath27 @xmath28    we expand the quantum fields in an orthonormal basis : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the mode functions and @xmath18 obey : @xmath32 latexmath:[\\[\\chi(\\tau ) = \\lambda\\bigl(-v^2+\\phi_i^2(\\tau)+{1\\over \\tau}n \\int \\ddk     we notice that when @xmath18 goes negative , the low momentum modes with @xmath34 grow exponentially .",
    "however these modes then feed back into the @xmath18 equation and this exponential growth then gets damped .",
    "it is these growing modes that lead to the possiblity of growing domains of dcc s as well as a modification of the low momentum distribution of particles from a thermal one .",
    "the parameters of the model are fixed by physical data .",
    "the pcac condition is @xmath35 in the vacuum state @xmath36 , so that @xmath37= 92.5 mev .",
    "the vacuum gap equation is @xmath38 this leads to the mass renormalized gap equation : @xmath39 @xmath40 is chosen to fit low energy scattering data as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the initial value of @xmath18 is determined by the equilibrium gap equation for an initial temperature of @xmath45 and is @xmath46 and the initial value of @xmath0 is just @xmath47 .",
    "the phase transition in this model occurs at a critical temperature of @xmath48 . to get into the unstable domain",
    ", we then introduce fluctuations in the time derivative of the classical field .",
    "we varied the value of the initial proper time derivative of the sigma field expectation value and found that for @xmath49 there is a narrow range of initial values that lead to the growth of instabilities , namely @xmath50 .",
    "figure one displays the results of the numerical simulation for the evolution of the system ( [ eq : mode])([eq : chi ] ) .",
    "we display the auxiliary field @xmath18 in units of @xmath51 and the proper time in units of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) for two simulations , one with an instability ( @xmath54 ) and one without ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we notice that for both initial conditions , the system eventually settles down to the broken symmetry vacuum result as a result of the expansion .    to determine the spectrum of particles we introduce the interpolating number density which is defined by expanding the fields in terms of mode functions @xmath56 which are first order in an adiabatic expansion of the mode equation .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "this leads to the alternative expansion of the fields : @xmath59    the two sets of creation and annihilation operators are connected by a bogoliubov transformation : @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be determined from the exact time evolving mode functions via : @xmath63 in terms of the initial distribution of particles @xmath64 and @xmath62 we have : @xmath65 @xmath66 is the adiabatic invariant interpolating phase space number density which becomes the actual particle number density when interactions have ceased .",
    "when this happens the distribution of particles is @xmath67 we now need to relate this quantity to the physical spectra of particles measured in the lab . at late @xmath7",
    "our system relaxes to the vacuum and @xmath18 becomes the square of the physical pion mass @xmath68 .",
    "we introduce the outgoing pion particle rapidity @xmath69 and @xmath70 defined by the particle 4-momentum in the center of mass coordinate system @xmath71 the boost that takes one from the center of mass coordinates to the comoving frame where the energy momentum tensor is diagonal is given by @xmath72 , so that one can define the  fluid \" 4-velocity in the center of mass frame as @xmath73 we then find that the variable @xmath74 has the meaning of the energy of the particle in the comoving frame .",
    "the momenta @xmath75 that enters into the adiabatic phase space number density is one of two canoncial momenta to the variables defined by the coordinate transformation to fluid light cone variables .",
    "namely the variables @xmath76 have as their canonical momenta @xmath77 to show this we consider the metric @xmath78 and the free lagrangian @xmath79 then we obtain for example @xmath80 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { et -k_z z   \\over \\tau } = k^{\\mu } u_{\\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interpolating phase - space density @xmath81 of particles depends on @xmath75 , @xmath82 , @xmath7 , and it is found to be @xmath21-independent and given by eq .",
    "( [ interp ] ) .    in order to obtain the physical particle rapidity and transverse momentum distribution , we change variables from @xmath83 to @xmath84 at a fixed @xmath7 where @xmath69 is the particle rapidity defined by ( [ kmu ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath85 where the jacobian @xmath86 is evaluated at a fixed proper time @xmath7 @xmath87 we also have @xmath88 calling the integration over the transverse dimension the effective transverse size of the colliding ions @xmath89",
    "we then obtain that : @xmath90 this quantity is independent of @xmath69 which is a consequence of the assumed boost invariance .    in a hydrodynamical model of heavy ion collisions @xcite , the final spectra of pions",
    "is given by a combination of the fluid flow and a local thermal equilibrium distribution in the comoving frame .",
    "one calculates this spectra at the critical temperature @xmath91 when the energy density goes below @xmath92 this defines the breakup surface , after which the particles no longer interact so that this distibution is frozen at that temperature . for an ultrarelativistic gas of pions ,",
    "this occurs when @xmath93 .",
    "the covariant form for the spectra of particles is given by the cooper- frye formula @xcite :      here @xmath95 is the single particle relativistic phase space distribution function . when there is local thermal equilibrium of pions at a comoving temperature @xmath96 one has @xmath97 -1 \\ } ^{-1}.\\ ] ] in the boost invariant approximation , the temperature is only a function of the proper time @xmath7 and the break up surface is a constant @xmath7 surface : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the effective transverse size of the system following the heavy ion collision .",
    "therefore we obtain the relationship that @xmath100 thus we can rewrite our expression for the field theory particle spectra as @xmath101 where in the second integration we keep @xmath69 and @xmath7 fixed .",
    "this shows that the cooper - frye formula for the final spectra of secondaries , which was derived from classical transport theory , also applies in field theory when one has a gaussian density matrix as in the large - n approximation .",
    "it also reconfirms the idea that the interpolating phase space number density plays the role of a classical transport phase space density function , as was found in our calculation of pair production from strong electric fields @xcite    in figures 2 and 3 we compare the boost invariant hydrodynamical result for the transverse momentum distribution using critical temperatures of @xmath102 mev to the two nonequilibrium cases represented in figure 1 .",
    "figure 2 pertains to the initial condition @xmath103 in this case there is a regime where the effective mass becomes negative and we see a noticable enhancement of the low transverse momentum spectra .",
    "we have normalized both results to give the same total center of mass energy @xmath104 .",
    "figure 3 corresponds to the initial condition latexmath:[${\\dot \\sigma }      in conclusion , we see that a non - equilibrium phase transition taking place during a time evolving quark - gluon or hadronic plasma can lead to an enhancement of the low momentum transverse momentum distribution .",
    "in particular , if a centauro type event is not accompanied by such an enhancement one would be suspicious of ascribing this event to the production of disoriented chiral condensates as a result of a rapid quench .",
