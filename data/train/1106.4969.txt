    "the optical - uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of quasars is broadly consistent with the expected emission of a thin accretion disk ( ad ) around a massive black hole ( shields 1978 ; czerny & elvis 1987 ; sun & malkan 1989 ; laor 1990 ; blaes et al .",
    "2001 ; shang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "various spectral features , such as the general turnover at @xmath19  ( zheng et al .",
    "1997 ; telfer 2002 ; barger & cowie 2010 ) , the observed optical - uv spectral slopes ( bonning et al . 2007 ; davis et al . 2007 ) , the small dispersion in the uv / optical flux ratio ( davis & laor 2011 ) , and microlensing variability ( morgan et al . 2010",
    "; blackburne et al .",
    "2011 ) , may imply various modifications beyond the simplest ad models ( see review by koratkar & blaes 1999 , and citations thereafter ) .",
    "one should note that some of the expected ad spectral features may be diluted by various unrelated emission components ( kishimoto et al . 2004 ; 2008 ) .",
    "the peak of the simplest ad model of local blackbody ( bb ) emission occurs at @xmath21 ( see  2 ) , or equivalently @xmath22 , where @xmath0 is the black hole mass , @xmath1 is the accretion rate , and @xmath23 is the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the eddington luminosity .",
    "thus , when @xmath0 increases from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , at a fixed @xmath26 , the disk cools by a factor of 100 .",
    "this factor is consistent with the drop from @xmath27  kev in x - ray binary systems ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) , to @xmath28  ev , observed in quasars .",
    "the quasar sed peaks at about the h ionization threshold , and thus provides ample ionizing luminosity which powers the broad and narrow line emission .",
    "a further extrapolation of the expected ad sed to @xmath29 and @xmath30 leads to @xmath31  ev and thus to a non - ionizing ad sed ( e.g. see laor & netzer 1989 fig.5 , for a model where @xmath27  ev ) .",
    "such models appeared inconsistent with the observations , as the sed of such quasars can not power strong line emission .",
    "such quasars will appear mostly as luminous continuum sources .",
    "some line emission can still be produced through x - ray photoionization .",
    "however , in luminous quasars the fraction of the bolometric luminosity in the x - ray drops well below 10% ( just et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the fraction of the bolometric power available for line emission thus drops from @xmath32% to @xmath33% .",
    ", i.e. by a factor of @xmath34 . the total line emission should drop by a similar factor .",
    "observational evidence that weak line quasars ( wlq ) do exist started to accumulate since the discovery of mcdowell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that in pg  1407 + 265 all lines , except h@xmath35 , are exceptionally weak .",
    "a bl lac origin could be clearly excluded based on its sed which overlaps well the mean sed of optically selected quasars ( elvis et al .",
    "additional wlq were discovered in various other studies ( fan et al .",

    "leighly et al .",
    "2007a ; hryniewicz et al .",
    "2010 ) , and were followed up by dedicated studies of larger samples of wlq at a range of wavelengths ( shemmer et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; diamond - stanic et al . 2009",
    "; plotkin et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ; wu et al .",
    "the observed radio to x - ray seds of most wlq is consistent with the mean sed of radio quiet quasars , and clearly excludes the bl lac interpretation for the absence of line emission .",
    "proposed explanations for wlq invoked unusual broad line legion ( blr ) properties , such as a low covering factor , an anisotropic ionizing source , or blr shielded from the ionizing source .",
    "a possibly related issue is that of ` true type 2 ' agn , i.e. agn which lack broad lines , but appear to be unobscured ( tran 2003 ; shi et al .",
    "these objects differ from wlq in two ways .",
    "first , they are defined by the lack of broad lines , and not by the lack of lines in general . however",
    ", once @xmath36 , the significant narrow lines are redshifted from optical spectroscopy , and one can not separate a lineless quasar from a type 2 agn .",
    "second , the ` true type 2 ' agn tend to reside at @xmath37 ( shi et al .",
    "2010 ; trump et al .",
    "2011 ) , in contrast with wlq which typically have @xmath38 ( e.g. shemmer et al . 2010 ) .",
    "various suggestions were made to explain the lack of broad lines in unobscured type 2 agn .",
    "nicastro ( 2000 ) , and nicastro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , suggested that the blr is formed by accretion disk instabilities occurring in a critical radius where the disk changes from gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated .",
    "this critical radius can become smaller than the innermost stable orbit , and then the blr can not form .",
    "czerny et al . ( 2004 ) and elitzur & ho ( 2009 ) suggested that the transition of the ad from a cold geometrically thin flow , to a hot advection dominated accretion flow , eliminates the ad wind which launches the blr .",
    "elitzur & shlosman ( 2006 ) suggested that the blr is formed by a torus outflow , and below a certain accretion rate the outflow transforms into radio jets , and the blr disappears .",
    "the various physical mechanisms suggested above to eliminate the blr generally occur below some values of @xmath26 , which may be a function of @xmath0 .",
    "these ranges correspond to a certain maximum line width , which may be function of @xmath39 , beyond which all agn become ` true type 2 ' agn .",
    "laor ( 2003 ) pointed out that the blr appears not to be detectable at fwhm @xmath40  km  s@xmath6 , which may either be a detection limit , or a maximal velocity where the blr can exist .",
    "however , no physical mechanism was put forward to explain why the blr fwhm may be the primary parameter for the existence of the blr . as shown below",
    ", a non - ionizing ad may provide a simple explanation for the observed luminosity independent upper limit on the blr fwhm .    in the following section we derive the accretion disk model parameters which produce a cold ad , i.e. an ad with a non - ionizing sed . in ",
    "3 we show that the sed of a wlq , observed as far as 570 , is fit surprisingly well by a cold ad model . in ",
    "4 we discuss additional implications , and the relevance to other observed properties of agn .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "below we first derive the relation between @xmath15 and the accretion disk model parameters , based on the standard shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 , ss73 ) thin disk model .",
    "the flux emitted per unit area is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the radius , and @xmath43 is a dimensionless factor set by the inner boundary condition , and the relativistic effects ( novikov & thorne 1973 ; riffert & herold 1995 ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the dimensionless radius , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , which gives @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the local effective temperature is @xmath48 , and it scales as @xmath49 where @xmath50 or in more convenient units @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 or in cgs units @xmath54 and @xmath55 we denote by @xmath2 the maximum value of @xmath56 , which sets the maximum disk temperature @xmath15 , assuming a local bb emission .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 is then a function of @xmath3 only .",
    "ratios for representative values of @xmath3 are provided in table 1 . as @xmath3 increases , the innermost marginally stable disk radius @xmath58 decreases , and @xmath57 increases .    note",
    "that @xmath2 is only a function of @xmath3 as we have assumed the standard ad structure , where the viscous torque increases inwards , reaches a maximum , and then drops until it vanishes at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . in reality , there is likely to be some magnetic stress at or near the inner boundary and continuing emission inside the isco . quantifying the level of additional emission from near or inside the isco is an active research topic ( e.g kulkarni et al .",
    "2011 , noble et al .",
    "2011 ) . however , any additional emission is not likely to cause significantly greater variation in @xmath59 than varying @xmath3 alone .",
    "for example , noble et al .",
    "( 2011 ) generally argue for a larger effect due to emission inside the isco than kulkarni et al .",
    "but they find that an @xmath8 would appear as an @xmath60 model if the emission at the disk surface is locally everywhere a bb .",
    "( note , however , that the radiation inside the isco may be far from thermodynamic equilibrium due to the drop in disk surface density , so local bb emission may not be a good approximation there . ) hence , in this work we will focus on the simple ad models where @xmath2 is determined solely by @xmath3 .    what is the frequency @xmath61 where the accretion disk @xmath62 peaks ?",
    "for a single temperature bb , it is simple to show that the peak occurs at @xmath63 .",
    "a local bb ad is a superposition of blackbodies with @xmath64 , weighted by the emitting surface area , and convolved by the relativistic effects .",
    "this superposition results in an integrated spectrum with a broader spectral energy distribution ( sed ) compared to a single temperature bb , which peaks at @xmath65 .",
    "table 1 lists the values of @xmath66 , corresponding to an ad observed at @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the inclination angle of the ad to the line of sight ( @xmath69 is face on ) .",
    "how low should @xmath61 be for an ad to be called non - ionizing ?",
    "let us define a non - ionizing ad , or a cold ad , as an ad where the ionizing luminosity is @xmath70 of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we now look for @xmath71 , the frequency above which the integrated luminosity is 1% of the bolometric luminosity , i.e. @xmath72 if @xmath73  hz , then the ad is cold .",
    "the values of @xmath74 depends on the ad sed , which is set by @xmath3 .",
    "table 1 provides @xmath75 values for different @xmath3 values , which all cluster at @xmath76 .",
    "thus , a non - ionizing ad peaks at @xmath77  hz , or @xmath78 . since the typical x - ray luminosity observed is @xmath79 , the ionizing luminosity of a cold ad is @xmath80 smaller than @xmath81 , and the ionization will be essentially all from @xmath81 .    we can also define a weakly - ionizing ad as an ad where the ionizing luminosity is @xmath82 . for such an accretion disk",
    "the ad ionizing luminosity is @xmath83 .",
    "such objects will form a transition from uv dominated ionization to x - ray dominated ionization .",
    "table 1 lists the values of @xmath84 , which cluster at @xmath85 . setting @xmath86  hz for a weakly - ionizing ad",
    "implies that in such an ad @xmath87  hz , or @xmath88 .",
    "using the calculated values of @xmath75 , @xmath89 , and @xmath57 , for a given @xmath3 , as provided in table 1 , we derive the following upper limits for a cold ad : @xmath90 for @xmath8 , and @xmath91 for @xmath10 . inserting these limits into eq .",
    "5 , yields the conditions @xmath92 when @xmath8 , and @xmath93 when @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath94 is known , then @xmath95 can be estimated from the ad model fit to the optical ( 5100 ) luminosity , @xmath11 . using eq . 8 in davis & laor ( 2011 ) rather than @xmath96 . the numerical factor in eq .",
    "7 should be @xmath97 rather than @xmath98 . however , the fitting function for @xmath1 in their eq . 8 , which corresponds to our eq .",
    "8 , is unaffected . ]",
    "@xmath99 where @xmath100 , we obtain the lower limits on @xmath11 , below which the ad is cold , @xmath101 for @xmath8 , and @xmath102 for @xmath10 .",
    "thus , even luminous quasars can become lineless , if @xmath94 is high enough .",
    "for example , for @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 , the ad becomes too cold to ionize when @xmath7 for @xmath8 , or for @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding value for @xmath26 are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , using the approximation @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath106  erg  s@xmath6 , and the implied relation @xmath107 .",
    "low luminosity agn need to have lower @xmath26 values to have a cold ad .",
    "for example , agn at @xmath108  erg  s@xmath6 need to have @xmath109 when @xmath8 , and @xmath110 when @xmath10 , to become cold .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is commonly estimated using the broad emission lines .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) gives @xmath111 where @xmath112=h@xmath12  fwhm/3000  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "inserting the kaspi et al .",
    "relation to eq . 8 above , gives ( davis & laor 2011 , eq .",
    "9 ) @xmath113 inserting these two expressions to eqs .  6 - 7 yields @xmath114 when @xmath8 , and @xmath115 when @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the criterion for a non - ionizing ad is set almost purely by the value of the h@xmath12 fwhm , and is very weakly dependent on @xmath11 .",
    "the ad becomes cold for h@xmath12 fwhm@xmath116  km  s@xmath6 , when @xmath8 , or for h@xmath12 fwhm@xmath117  km  s@xmath6 , when @xmath10 .",
    "the quasar may become lineless when the h@xmath12 fwhm is above these limits .",
    "these maximal values for the h@xmath12 fwhm for an ionizing ad may correspond to the maximum values of the observable h@xmath12 fwhm , as quasars with broader lines may drop out from quasar surveys which are based on emission lines selection , due to their significantly weaker line emission .",
    "figure 1 shows the range of seds for various ad models .",
    "all models have the same absolute accretion rate @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the upper two panels show local bb accretion disk models . in both panels",
    "the sed gets softer as @xmath0 increases , since @xmath120 ( see eq .  4 ) . at a given @xmath0 ,",
    "the sed is softer for the @xmath8 model , and @xmath61 is a factor of 2.4 lower compared to the @xmath10 model ( as can be deduced from table 1 ) .",
    "note that although the @xmath10 ad is hotter than the @xmath8 case by a factor of @xmath121 , the sed of the @xmath8 model has @xmath122 compared to only 1.18 for the @xmath10 model , which makes the @xmath10 model @xmath61 only a factor of 2.4 higher than for the @xmath8 model .",
    "each curve is labeled with the ionization fraction @xmath123 , which is defined as the fraction of the bolometric luminosity that is radiated at all wavelengths shortward of the the lyman edge .",
    "there are two effects which can make the observed spectrum harder than shown in fig.1 for the local bb models .",
    "these effects will increase the required minimal h@xmath12 fwhm for an ad to become cold .",
    "first , the ad sed is non isotropic . in the newtonian case",
    "only the normalization of the ad luminosity changes with inclination .",
    "however , the relativistic effects change also the shape of the sed , making it harder closer to an edge on view .",
    "the blr must subtend an appreciable fraction of the sky , as seen by the ionizing source .",
    "the blr is most likely in the form of a thick torus - like configuration , coplanar with the ad .",
    "the ionizing sed seen by the blr will then be harder than the observed sed , which is likely seen at a smaller inclination , closer to a face on view .",
    "assuming the torus - like configuration where the blr resides , is restricted to @xmath124 , and the clear line of sight cone where the agn is unobscured is restricted to @xmath125 , it is plausible to assume that the mean inclination of the blr is @xmath126 , while our line of sight has a mean value of @xmath119 .",
    "table 1 provides @xmath127 , and shows that the blr can be exposed to an sed a factor of @xmath128 harder than the observed sed .",
    "if we denote @xmath129 , and use the parameter @xmath130 , then the minimal value for @xmath112 derived in eqs.13,14 scales as @xmath131 .",
    "table 1 lists @xmath132 values for a range of @xmath3 values . applying this inclination correction for the hardness of the ionizing",
    "sed implies minimal h@xmath12 fwhm values of 9090  km  s@xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) , and 25,820  km  s@xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) .    the second effect which can make the ad sed harder is deviations from the local bb approximation .",
    "a deviation from a local bb necessarily leads to a photospheric temperature @xmath133 .",
    "table 2 provides the ratios of @xmath134 derived from detailed ad atmosphere models computed with tlusty .",
    "these model are physically equivalent to those presented in hubeny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but utilize the interpolation scheme described in davis & hubeny ( 2006 ) . since we have a limited range of converged annuli , we only consider tlusty models with @xmath135 . in the local bb ad models",
    "@xmath136 depends only on @xmath3 and @xmath137 , as @xmath0 and @xmath1 only shift the sed , and do not affect its shape . in the atmospheric model the local emission is set by the photospheric density and temperature , and table 2 provides models for the ad parameters which produce a relatively cold ad , relevant for our study . since @xmath133 the sed is expected to be hotter compared to the bb model for the same parameters , and thus produce a higher @xmath138 value .",
    "a notable caveat is that some models have a strong lyman absorption edge , which can lead to a lower @xmath123 compared to the local bb ad model , despite the higher @xmath139 .",
    "figure 1 , lower panel , presents the ad sed derived from the tlusty models .",
    "the deviation of these detailed calculations from the simple bb approximation are strongly dependent on the local disk @xmath15 and the photospheric density .",
    "the photospheric density also depends ( albeit more weakly ) on the the stress prescription , which is parametrized here using @xmath140 ( ss73 ) .",
    "the ss73 model gives a vertically averaged density which scales as @xmath141 in the radiation dominated regime .",
    "the dependence of the photospheric density on @xmath35 in tlusty models is typically much weaker , for reasons discussed in the appendix of davis et al . (",
    "2006 ) , unless @xmath35 and @xmath1 are both large enough that the disk begins to become effectively optically thin .",
    "the sed can be significantly harder than the local bb model when @xmath15 is high .",
    "for example , @xmath61 increases by a factor @xmath142 for the @xmath143 , @xmath118 model .",
    "however , the significantly colder ad which are of interest here , are not far from the local bb approximation .",
    "table 2 provides the correction factors @xmath144 for @xmath119 . since @xmath145",
    ", atmospheric effects can increase the minimal h@xmath12 fwhm values by a factor of @xmath146 .",
    "the sed of quasars with a cold ad should show a sharp cutoff beyond the lyman limit .",
    "the wlq population comes closest to the lineless quasars population .",
    "the wlq with the highest rest frame uv energy probed is sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 , at @xmath147 , discovered by hryniewicz et al .",
    "the galex fuv photometry extends down to rest frame 570 .",
    "figure 2 presents a local bb ad match to the overall sed presented by hryniewicz et al .",
    "the ad model parameters were : @xmath148 , as estimated by hryniewicz et al . based on the mg  ii fwhm and the 3000  continuum luminosity .",
    "we assume an ad with a face on view ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath1 was then adapted to reproduce the overall sed normalization .",
    "the remaining free parameter is @xmath3 , which is varied to match the fuv turnover .",
    "a suitable match to the data is found with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "a good match can also be obtained with a higher inclination ad model , where the resulting harder sed is compensated by allowing a lower @xmath3 .",
    "a reasonable match can be obtained down to @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , i.e. a bh counter - rotating with respect to the ad .",
    "a higher inclination , @xmath153 , is excluded , as the ad sed becomes too hard , and @xmath3 can not be further reduced to compensate for that . similarly , a value of @xmath154 is excluded , as the ad is too hard and and @xmath137 can not be further increased to compensate for that .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained by czerny et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who also discuss the effects of intrinsic reddening on the derived ad parameters .",
    "we also attempted tlusty model fits to the data , however the sed of these models is broader than the local bb ad models , and a fit of comparable quality to the local bb ad models fit could not be obtained .",
    "could the observed uv emission be significantly affected by the foreground lyman forest absorption ?",
    "barger & cowie ( 2010 , fig.6 there ) show that the cumulative effect of the lyman @xmath35 absorption systems along the line of sight , suppresses the continuum at rest frame 912@xmath1551216by a level of 4% for @xmath156 . using the evolution of the lyman forest systems , @xmath157 for @xmath158 ( janknecht et al .",
    "2002 ) , the expected continuum suppression at @xmath147 is @xmath159% , and is thus not significant . however , lyman limit systems can produce significant absorption at rest frame @xmath160912 . to affect the observed sed",
    "the lyman limit absorber should occur longward of observed 1516   ( the galex fuv effective wavelength ) , i.e have @xmath161 . using the number density per unit redshift evolution of @xmath162 ( songaila & cowie 2010 ) ,",
    "the expected number of absorbers integrated over @xmath163 , is 0.66 .",
    "a lyman limit absorber will likely cause a break in the spectral curvature , which is not seen in the data ( fig.2 ) .",
    "a further complication may arise if a foreground lyman break is diluted by a lyman continuum emission edge produced by the ad .",
    "uv spectroscopy is required to clearly exclude foreground absorption effects on the observed fuv sed of sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 .",
    "the clear prediction of local bb ad models is that agn with the correct combination of @xmath0 and @xmath26 harbor a luminous , but non - ionizing , continuum source .",
    "the uv sed of an agn with @xmath164 will show a peak at @xmath165 , and a steep drop at @xmath19 , and may form a lineless quasar , depending on the relative strength of the x - ray ionizing power - law continuum .",
    "an agn with @xmath166 will show a peak at @xmath167 , and will likely form a wlq , with an sed similar to that observed in the wlq sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 .",
    "a cold non - ionizing ad is expected in luminous , @xmath168  erg  s@xmath6 , quasars even at relatively high values of @xmath169 , in particular for @xmath170 . in low luminosity agn , @xmath171  erg  s@xmath6 ,",
    "the sed is predicted to become non - ionizing only at very low values of @xmath172 . since the x - ray /",
    "optical luminosity ratio is observed to increase with decreasing @xmath173 , such low luminosity and low @xmath26 agn may be characterized by more prominent line emission , excited by the relatively stronger x - ray power - law emission .",
    "what is the nature of the expected blr emission ?",
    "the flat x - ray power - law continuum produces an extended region of low ionization in the blr gas , which is expected to cool mostly through collisionally excited low ionization lines , such as fe  ii , mg  ii , and balmer lines ( collisionally excited due to highly trapped ly@xmath35 photons ) .",
    "the narrow line region gas is expected to cool mostly through forbidden low ionization lines , such as o  i , n  ii , and s  ii lines , as seen in liners ( see photoionization model results in ferland & netzer 1983 ) .",
    "is it possible that agn surveys are missing a significant number of moderately high @xmath26 , high @xmath0 agn which are lineless ? .",
    "this can be addressed by surveys of agn based on color , independent of line emission .",
    "this was carried out by diamond - stanic ( 2009 ) using the sdss sample , where they defined wlq as having a ly@xmath35 ew@xmath17415.4 , which is 3@xmath175 from the mean ly@xmath35 ew=63.6 .",
    "they find that the fraction of quasars classified as wlq increases from 1.3% at @xmath176 to 6.2% at @xmath177 .",
    "thus , lineless quasars do not form a significant part of the quasar population , as expected given the required very high @xmath0 values in luminous agn , in order to have a cold ad .",
    "in contrast with luminous agn , a significant fraction of low luminosity agn near the more massive black hole should fall in the cold ad regime . theoretically , it is not clear whether the thin ad configuration remains valid at @xmath178 , or whether the accretion transforms to an optically thin and geometrically thick configuration , which may produce a hard power - law continuum source ( e.g. narayan et al . 1998 ) .",
    "observationally , the narrow emission lines of low luminosity agn in massive galaxies are generally characterized as liners , and are likely to be powered by a hard continuum source ( ferland & netzer 1983 ) , as their observed sed apparently suggests ( e.g. ho 2008 , eracleous et al . 2010a ; cf .",
    "maoz 2007 ) .",
    "thus , the significant contribution of x - ray heating in low luminosity agn , given their flat @xmath179 , may imply that fuv heating is not significant in these objects anyhow , and its absence as the ad becomes cold will not affect their line emission significantly , unlike typical luminous agn where the fuv dominates the line excitation . the line emission in liners may also be powered by additional mechanisms ( e.g. eracleous et al .",
    "2010b ) , which further lowers the diagnostic power of the line emission on the ionizing sed shape .",
    "interestingly , lawrence ( 2005 ) finds that the change in the sed of a few potentially characteristic agn , extending over a range of @xmath180 in luminosity , is consistent with the expected change for an optically thick ad at a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "it remains to be explored whether the optical - uv sed in the lowest luminosity agn ( e.g. liner ) can be fit by a cold ad , or whether only a featureless hard power - law is required .",
    "a cold ad in low luminosity agn can not produce a lineless agn , unless @xmath179 is unusually steep , and ionizing radiation is indeed missing .      in `` true type 2 agn '' which show normal ( non liner ) narrow lines , the absence of broad lines does not result from a cold ad , as an apparently normal photoionizing radiation , which excites the narrow lines , is present .",
    "in such objects , the blr may be absent due to the absence of the mechanism which produces it , such as an ad wind , as proposed by nicastro ( 2000 ) , nicastro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , czerny et al.(2004 ) , elitzur & shlosman ( 2006 ) and elitzur & ho ( 2009 ) .      are most wlq powered by a cold ad ?",
    "the archetype wlq , pg  1407 + 265 , is probably not , as it s optical - uv sed appears to be similar to the average quasar sed ( mcdowell et al . 1995 ) .",
    "it does not show the expected peak at @xmath167  and a sharp drop at @xmath19  ( although the the s / n at @xmath19  is rather low ) . however , its peculiar emission line properties , with some detectable low ionization lines ( balmer lines , mg  ii , fe  ii ) , but very weak or no detectable higher ionization lines , is characteristic of other wlq ( leighly et al . 2007a ; diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 ; plotkin 2010b ; shemmer et al .",
    "2010 ; hryniewicz et al .",
    "2010 ; wu et al .",
    "2011 ) . in the case of phl  1811 , this line emission is modeled by an unusually soft ionizing spectrum ( leighly et al .",
    "2007b ) , which is however qualitatively similar to the emission of a cold ad . the soft ionizing sed produces little heating per ionization , and thus weak collisionally excited lines compared to recombination lines .",
    "some wlq may be driven by a different processes .",
    "the c  iv ew is tightly inversely related with @xmath26 ( baskin & laor 2004 ) , and also with other emission line properties , such as the [ o  iii ] and fe  ii ew ( baskin & laor 2005 ) , which are part of the eigenvector 1 correlations of various emission line properties ( boroson & green 1992 ) . the c  iv ew is also related to the c  iv line peak velocity shift and profile asymmetry ( e.g. baskin & laor 2005 ; richards et al .",
    "2011 ) , and @xmath179 ( baskin & laor 2005 ; wu et al .",
    "this large set of correlations suggests that local effects in the blr ( e.g. metallicity , kinematics ) , may control the ew of c  iv , and possibly of other high ionization uv lines . if the driving mechanism for wlq is a filtered ionizing continuum which illuminates the blr ( e.g. richards et al .",
    "2011 ; wu et al .",
    "2011 ) , then the effect on the blr excitation may be similar to the effect of a cold ad .",
    "however , the trend of decreasing c  iv ew with increasing @xmath26 can not be confused with the cold ad effect , as higher @xmath26 implies a hotter ad sed , rather than a colder one .",
    "the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which produces a cold ad , can be transformed to a limit on the h@xmath12 fwhm , with very weak @xmath11 dependence .",
    "the local bb ad may become cold at @xmath16  km  s@xmath6 when @xmath8 , and for @xmath17  km  s@xmath6 when @xmath10 .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath13 can be higher by a factor of up to 2 due to the inclination dependence of the ionizing continuum , and possible deviation of the disk emission from a local bb continuum .",
    "agn do show a sharp drop in their number at @xmath181  km  s@xmath6 ( e.g. hao et al . 2005 , shen et al .",
    "2008 ) , and this drop is independent of luminosity ( shen et al .",
    "2008 , fig.3 there ) .",
    "laor ( 2003 ) suggested there may be a yet unknown physical mechanism which suppresses the blr at @xmath182  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the ad becoming too cold to ionize the blr , may provide a natural explanation for the observed luminosity independent limiting @xmath13 , beyond which broad lines are not seen .",
    "how does the line emission of agn with the broadest lines appear ?",
    "do such objects enter the wlq regime ?",
    "such a systematic study is not available yet .",
    "however , very broad line objects tend to have a double - peaked emission profile , and the spectrum of the `` prototypical '' such object , arp  102b , shows strong balmer and mg  ii lines , strong low ionization forbidden lines , and relatively weak higher ionization lines ( halpern et al .",
    "only anecdotal information is available for a couple of more such objects ( storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "2005 ; eracleous et al .",
    "2009 ) , partly consistent with the results for arp  102b .",
    "a systematic study is clearly required to explore whether very broad line agn indeed have emission line properties intermediate between normal agn and wlq .",
    "what is the sed of very broad line quasars ?",
    "strateva et al ( 2008 ) shows the overall sed of five double - peaked balmer lines agn , with @xmath183  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "their optical - uv sed is generally consistent with the average agn sed , but the fuv at @xmath19  is not probed . the objects have a flatter @xmath179 than the average for quasars at a similar luminosity ( see also strateva et al .",
    "this may indicate indirectly that significant x - ray heating is required for generating the broad lines in these objects , as very broad line quasars with an average @xmath179 may be selected against due to their weaker line emission .",
    "the flatter @xmath179 may therefore compensate for a smaller contribution of the uv continuum , if their ad is indeed colder .",
    "a systematic study of the fuv emission of very broad line agn can test if their fuv is indeed steeper .",
    "an alternative approach to test the cold ad scenario is to explore the emission line properties of agn where the sed indicates weak fuv emission .",
    "it is important to note that red quasars ( e.g. richards et al . 2003 ) are not suitable objects , as a cold ad produces a normal blue continuum at @xmath165 .",
    "red quasars are either affected by dust extinction , or by some other modification of the continuum emission mechanism .",
    "cold ad candidates can be found by looking for quasars with a blue nuv slope , @xmath184 , and a red fuv slope , @xmath185 , as seen in sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "such observation can not be achieved from the ground , as the required @xmath186 to probe the fuv slope from the ground , leads to a high probability for an intervening lyman limit absorption system ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "space based uv observation of @xmath188 quasars are essential for that , as was done by hryniewicz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using galex .",
    "the observed optical - uv sed of optically selected quasars shows a small dispersion ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ; richards et al . 2006 ) . due to this",
    "davis & laor ( 2011 ) deduced that the accretion efficiency , @xmath189 , increases with @xmath0 , to compensate for the drop in the fuv with increasing @xmath0 for ad models at a fixed @xmath189 .",
    "one may worry that the implied rise in @xmath189 with @xmath0 is just a selection effect , as high @xmath0 and low @xmath189 quasars necessarily have a cold ad , produce weak line emission , and are selected against in a broad emission line agn survey .",
    "however , a color based agn survey is not blind to a cold ad quasar , and as noted above , diamond - stanic ( 2009 ) find that only 1.3% of @xmath176 color selected agn are wlq .",
    "thus , there is no large population of low @xmath3 high @xmath0 quasars , and the high mean @xmath189 ( high @xmath3 ) values for high @xmath0 agn deduced by davis & laor ( 2011 ) , is not driven by emission line selection .",
    "we note that quasars generally show a soft - excess x - ray emission below 1  kev , compared to the 2 - 10  kev power - law emission ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ) , which may extend as a single power - law component to the fuv ( laor et al .",
    "this component is commonly attributed to comptonization in a warm surface layer above the ad ( e.g. kriss et al .",
    "such a layer can turn a cold ad sed into an ionizing sed .",
    "the sed of sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 is consistent with the exponential cold ad fuv cutoff , and shows no indication for a power - law component .",
    "such a warm comptonizing surface corona may be lacking in a cold ad ( czerny et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2010 ) attribute the optical - uv emission feature in blazars observed with the _ swift _ satellite to thermal ad emission , based on the low polarization and low variability of this component .",
    "this component shows a peak in the nuv and a steep falloff in the fuv , and is fit with an ad model with very high values of @xmath0 , up to @xmath190 in some objects . these are therefore generally cold ad models , and if the blr emission in these objects is powered mostly by the unbeamed thermal disk emission , some of these blazars should appear as wlq . indeed ,",
    "some of the objects in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2010 ) do show weaker uv lines ( e.g. s5 0014 + 81 , see kuhr et al .",
    "1983 , sargent et al . 1989",
    "; pks  2149 - 306 , see wilkes 1986 ; rbs  315 , see ellison et al .",
    "2008 ) , which may provide independent support for the cold ad interpretation of their optical - uv bump .",
    "however , intervening lyman limit absorption systems are clearly contributing to the observed fuv steep falloff in these @xmath191 blazars , so the intrinsic ad continuum may not be as cold as observed .",
    "in addition , one can not exclude additional line excitation from the highly luminous jets in these objects .",
    "standard thin ad models imply a non ionizing continuum for high @xmath0 ( @xmath192 ) , even for fairly luminous quasars ( @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 ) , in particular if the black hole is non - rotating .",
    "such cold ad may reside in agn where the balmer line fwhm@xmath193  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the ionizing continuum in such objects originates only in the x - ray power - law component , which will likely produce an extended partially ionized region in the illuminated gas , which cools mostly through low ionization lines .",
    "if @xmath194 , as commonly seen in luminous agn , the ionizing luminosity will be weaker by a factor of @xmath195 than in average agn .",
    "such objects will appear as wlq . if @xmath196 such quasars may be lineless .",
    "cold ad provide a natural explanation for the sharp drop in the number of agn with broad line fwhm@xmath197  km  s@xmath6 , which is independent of luminosity .",
    "followup fuv observation are required to test if very broad line agn show the expected spectral turnover in the fuv , if they are powered by a cold ad .",
    "the best strategy is to obtain uv spectra of @xmath20 very broad line quasars , to minimize the likelihood of intervening lyman limit absorption by the igm , or to detect such absorption if it occurs .",
    "color selected agn samples indicate that only a small fraction ( @xmath198% ) of luminous agn may harbor a cold ad .",
    "this can result from the high mean @xmath189 values for agn at high @xmath0 , which may imply a higher @xmath3 and a hotter ad emission which produces a higher @xmath123 .",
    "searches for quasars with a blue optical - nuv and a red fuv continuum , using ground based optical spectra , and space based uv spectra of @xmath199 quasars , may be an efficient mechanism to reveal cold ad agn .",
    "the continuum of a wlq provided by hryniewicz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which extends down to @xmath200 , is surprisingly well fit by a simple local bb ad models .",
    "this is in contrast with most agn , where the sed can not be well fit by a simple local bb ad model .",
    "the local bb models provide a better match than the tlusty - based models ( hubeny et al .",
    "2000 ) , suggesting that the effects of the lyman edge and electron scattering opacity on the spectrum may be overestimated by these models .",
    "since both @xmath0 and @xmath11 are determined from the observations of sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 , only @xmath3 and @xmath137 remain as free parameters to match the observed sed .",
    "the fit allows us to place an upper limit on the black hole spin ( @xmath201 ) , and a lower limit on the inclination of the ad ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "the precise limits are somewhat uncertain , in part because the mg  ii line - based estimates of @xmath0 are uncertain .",
    "a larger @xmath0 would allow a wider range of @xmath3 and @xmath137 , but a smaller @xmath0 would provide tighter constraints : an even lower limit on @xmath3 and higher limit on @xmath137 , as further discussed by czerny et al .",

    "it is worthwhile to explore whether there are additional objects which can be well fit by a cold ad sed , with only @xmath3 and @xmath137 as free parameters .",
