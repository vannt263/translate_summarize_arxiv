    "accelerating particles using oscillating potentials is an area of extensive research@xcite , first triggered by the ideas of fermi on the origin of cosmic rays . in his seminal paper on the origin of cosmic rays",
    ", he stated that `` cosmic rays are originated and accelerated primarily in the interstellar space of the galaxy by _ collisions _ against moving magnetic fields''@xcite .",
    "this understanding lead to the development of two major models : the fermi - ulam accelerator , which deals with the bouncing of a particle off an oscillating surface in the presence of another fixed surface parallel to it ; and the fermi - pustylnikov accelerator , where the particle bounces off an oscillating surface in the presence of gravity . in the case of the fermi - ulam accelerator",
    "@xcite it was shown that the energy of the particle remains bounded and the unlimited acceleration proposed by fermi is absent @xcite . in the fermi - pustylnikov accelerator ,",
    "by contrast , there exists a set of initial data within specific domains of phase space that result in trajectories speeding up to infinity .    in recent years",
    "the acceleration of laser - cooled atoms has become a topic of great interest for applications such as atom interferometry and the development of matter - wave based inertial sensors .",
    "possible schemes of matter - wave acceleration have been proposed and studied .",
    "for example , a bose einstein condensate in a frequency - chirped optical lattice@xcite and an atom in an amplitude modulated optical lattice in the presence of a gravitational field display acceleration@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-kicked accelerator in the latter case operates for certain sets of initial data that originate in stable islands of phase space .    here ,",
    "we discuss an experimentally realizable technique to accelerate a material wavepacket in a coherent fashion .",
    "it consists of an atom optics version of the fermi - pustylnikov accelerator  @xcite where a cloud of ultracold atoms falling in a gravitational field bounces off a spatially modulated atomic mirror .",
    "this scheme is different from previous accelerator schemes in the following ways : _ i _ ) the regions of phase space that support acceleration are located in the mixed phase space rather than in the islands of stability ( or nonlinear resonances ) ; _ ii _ ) the acceleration of the wavepacket is coherent ; _ iii _ ) it occurs only for certain windows of oscillation strengths .",
    "we consider a cloud of laser - cooled atoms that move along the vertical @xmath1-direction under the influence of gravity and bounce back off an atomic mirror  @xcite .",
    "this mirror is formed by a laser beam incident on a glass prism and undergoing total internal reflection , thereby creating an optical evanescent wave of intensity @xmath2 and characteristic decay length @xmath3 outside of the prism .",
    "the laser intensity is modulated by an acousto - optic modulator as @xcite @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the frequency and @xmath6 the amplitude of modulation .",
    "the laser frequency is tuned far from any atomic transition , so that there is no significant upper - state atomic population .",
    "the excited atomic level(s ) can then be adiabatically eliminated , and the atoms behave for all practical purposes as scalar particles of mass @xmath7 whose center - of - mass motion is governed by the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the atomic momentum along @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "we proceed by introducing the dimensionless position and momentum coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the scaled time @xmath14 , the dimensionless intensity @xmath15 , the steepness @xmath16 , and the modulation strength @xmath17 of the evanescent wave field .",
    "when extended to an ensemble of non - interacting particles , the classical dynamics obeys the condition of incompressibility of the flow  @xcite , and the phase space distribution function @xmath18 satisfies the liouville equation . in the absence of mirror modulation ,",
    "the atomic dynamics is integrable .",
    "for very weak modulations the incommensurate motion almost follows the integrable evolution and remains rigorously stable , as prescribed by the kam theorem .",
    "as the modulation increases , though , the classical system becomes chaotic .    in the quantum regime",
    ", the atomic evolution obeys the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "the commutation relation , @xmath19 = { \\it i}(\\omega^3 /mg^2 ) \\hbar\\equiv { \\it i}k^{\\hspace{-2.1mm}-}$ ] , naturally leads to the introduction of the dimensionless planck constant , @xmath20 .",
    "it can easily be varied by changing for instance @xmath5 , thereby permitting to study the transition from the semiclassical to the purely quantum dynamics of the atoms .",
    "the classical version of the is characterized by the existence of a set of initial conditions resulting in trajectories that accelerate without bound@xcite .",
    "more precisely , the classical evolution of the fermi accelerator displays the onset of global diffusion above a critical modulation strength @xmath21@xcite , while the quantum evolution remains localized until a larger value @xmath22 of the modulation@xcite . above that point",
    "both the classical and the quantum dynamics are diffusive .",
    "however , for specific sets of initial conditions that lie within phase space disks of radius @xmath23 , accelerating modes appear for values of the modulation strength @xmath24 within the windows  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 can take integer and half - integer values for the sinusoidal modulation of the reflecting surface considered here .     and @xmath27 with @xmath28 , is propagated for @xmath29 ( left ) and @xmath30 ( right ) for time @xmath31 .",
    "the numerical calculations correspond to cesium atoms of mass @xmath32 kg bouncing off an atomic mirror with an intensity modulation of @xmath33 .",
    "the modulation frequencies extend to the megahertz range , and @xmath34 @xmath35 m . ]    we found numerically that for a modulation strength outside the windows of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lcon ] ) the dynamics is dominantly diffusive .",
    "however , as the fundamental requirement for the acceleration is met by chosing a modulation strength within the windows the ensemble displays a nondispersive and coherent acceleration , fig .",
    "[ one ] . a small diffusive background results from a small part of the initial distribution which is residing outside the area of phase space supporting acceleration .",
    "this coherent acceleration restricts the momentum space variance @xmath36 which then remains very small indicating the absence of diffusive dynamics@xcite .    in the quantum case",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle imposes a limit on the smallest size of the initial wavepacket .",
    "thus in order to form an initial wavepacket that resides entirely within regions of phase space leading to coherent dispersionless acceleration , an appropriate value of the effective planck constant must be chosen , for example , by controlling the frequency @xmath5@xcite . for a broad wavepacket ,",
    "the coherent acceleration manifests itself as regular spikes in the marginal probability distributions @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    ,",
    "plotted for ( a ) @xmath30 within acceleration window , and ( b ) @xmath39 outside the acceleration window .",
    "the spikes in the momentum distribution for @xmath30 are a signature of coherent accelerated dynamics .",
    "the initial width of the momentum distribution is @xmath40 and the probability distributions are recorded after a scaled propagation time @xmath41 .",
    "the initial probability distributions has variance @xmath40 , which fulfills the minimum uncertainty relation . ]",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] which shows the marginal probability distribution @xmath42 for ( a ) @xmath30 and ( b ) @xmath39 , both in the classical and the quantum domains . in this example",
    ", the initial area of the particle phase - space distribution is taken to be large compared to the size of the phase - space regions leading to purely unbounded dispersionless acceleration .",
    "the sharp spikes in , @xmath42 appear when the modulation strength satisfies the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lcon ] ) , and gradually disappear as it exits these windows .",
    "these spikes are therefore a signature of the coherent accelerated dynamics .",
    "in contrast , the portions of the initial probability distribution originating from the regions of the phase space that do not support accelerated dynamics undergo diffusive dynamics .    from the numerical results of fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , we conjecture that the spikes are well described by a sequence of gaussian distributions separated by a distance @xmath43 , both in momentum space and coordinate space .",
    "we can therefore express the complete time - evolved wavepacket composed of a series of sharply - peaked gaussian distributions superposed to a broad background due to diffusive dynamics , such that @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is a normalization constant .    .",
    "the coherent acceleration results in a breathing of the atomic wave packet , as evidenced by the out - of - phase oscillations of the variances .",
    "( b ) dynamics for @xmath39 , a modulation strength that does not result in coherent acceleration .",
    "note the absence of breathing in that case .",
    "same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] . ]    further insight in the quantum acceleration of the atomic wavepacket is obtained by studying its temporal evolution .",
    "we find that within the window of acceleration the atomic wave packet displays a linear growth in the square of the momentum variance and in the coordinate space variance .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] illustrates that for modulation strengths within the acceleration window , the growth in square of the momentum variance displays oscillations of increasing periodicity whereas the variance in coordinate space follows with a phase difference of @xmath47 .",
    "the out - of - phase oscillatory evolutions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 indicate a breathing of the wavepacket and is a signature of the coherence in accelerated dynamics . as a final point",
    "we note that outside of the acceleration window the linear growth in the square of the momentum variance , a consequence of normal diffusion , translates into a @xmath50 law , with @xmath51 which is a consequence of anomalous diffusion .",
    "we have investigated the classical and quantum evolution of atoms in a fermi accelerator beyond the regime of dynamical localization where diffusive behavior occurs both in the classical and the quantum domains .",
    "we have identified the conditions leading to the coherent acceleration of the atoms , and found signatures of the behavior both for an ensemble of classical particles and for a quantum wavepacket . a quantum wavepacket with a broad initial variance , restricted by the heisenberg uncertainty principle results in the coherent acceleration occurring on top of a diffusive background .",
