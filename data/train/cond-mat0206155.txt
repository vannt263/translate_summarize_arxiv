    "in the past few years granular materials  @xcite have become a fast growing field of research . in this framework ,",
    "a strong interest has arisen in the subject of the so - called granular gases , systems of grains at very low density so that the collisions can be considered always binary and instantaneous  @xcite .",
    "the collisions among the grains are dissipative , and the amount of energy lost in each collision is parametrized by the so - called restitution coefficient @xmath1 ( see below for a precise definition ) .",
    "since the energy of the system is therefore not conserved an external forcing is usually applied to obtain a dynamic stationary state . for this kind of systems , the analogy with perfect gases",
    "allows to introduce a _ granular _ temperature  @xcite defined as the mean square fluctuation of the velocity , that is @xmath2 even though the velocity distribution could not be gaussian .    in the case of zero external forcing",
    "@xcite ( i.e. the so - called free cooling ) , granular temperature decreases in time and goes asymptotically to zero when all the particles finally stop .",
    "when an energy input feeds the system , instead , the granular temperature may reach a stationary value and several modeling for the stochastic driving have been proposed employing a constant  @xcite or a random  @xcite restitution coefficient .    in numerical simulations or in experiments",
    ", @xmath3 is often measured taking the average @xmath4 on the whole system .",
    "however strong fluctuations in the local granular temperature are usually observed  @xcite . even considering only the global granular temperature , i.e. for small spatial inhomogeneities",
    ", it is not clear to which extent @xmath3 can be considered the `` temperature '' of the system .",
    "there are of course several possible paths to face this problem .",
    "one interesting point of view is that of investigating the response properties of an external thermometer coupled to a granular gas  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to study the fluctuation - dissipation properties of the system  @xcite . for a system",
    "slightly perturbed from its stationary equilibrium state linear response theory allows to relate the response to the correlation functions through the fluctuation - dissipation relations  @xcite .    in the simplest case , given a perturbing field @xmath5 , a fluctuation - dissipation relation relates the response of an observable @xmath6 at the time @xmath7 , after an impulsive perturbation at time @xmath8 , to the correlation of the observable @xmath6 and the field @xmath9 , _ conjugated _ to @xmath5 , measured in the unperturbed system ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the equilibrium temperature of the system .",
    "recently green - kubo expressions for a homogeneous cooling granular gas have been obtained  @xcite and numerical simulations have confirmed their validity  @xcite : cooling granulars lack an equilibrium state , therefore the homogeneous cooling state ( which is characterized by scaling properties ) is used as reference state to be perturbed , but in this case the green - kubo relations must be changed in order to keep into account new terms arising from the time dependence of the reference state and the non - conservative character of collisions ( see  @xcite ) . however , in the case of steady state granular gases , a rigorous derivation of green - kubo relations has not yet been performed to our knowledge .    in this paper",
    "we perform numerical investigations in order to check the validity of standard kubo formulas  @xcite to steady state inelastic gases .",
    "we perform in particular two different sets of numerical experiments on heated granular gases .",
    "we choose two different conjugated pairs of variables constituted by the autocorrelation of a given variable and the corresponding response to a perturbation applied to the gas .",
    "kubo s formula , i.e. the proportionality between response and the autocorrelation in the unperturbed system , is verified to hold using the granular temperature as the correct proportionality factor , at least for not too strong inelasticities ( @xmath12 ) . for stronger inelasticities ( smaller values of @xmath1 )",
    "kubo s formula can be verified with a different effective temperature .",
    "it should be noted how the adopted simulation scheme ( i.e. direct simulation monte carlo ) represents the numerical implementation of the boltzmann equation ( given for example in  @xcite ) which assumes molecular chaos hypothesis and therefore neglects short range correlations .",
    "for this reason , for very strong inelasticities the boltzmann equation ( and the dsmc scheme ) can not be considered realistic and one should use molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "these results differ from the analogous results obtained for dense granular assemblies , where `` slow '' degrees of freedom thermalize at an effective temperature which is far higher than the external imposed temperature  @xcite .",
    "however the gas - like state of granular matter has nothing to do with these systems , as their stationary state is governed by a rapid decay of the fluctuations and the granular temperature turns out to be the right choice in the description of linear response to slight perturbations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the model as well as its simulation scheme and give a brief review of known results about the peculiar features of its non - equilibrium stationary state .",
    "section iii reviews kubo s formula and its extension to non - hamiltonian perturbations . in section",
    "iv we describe numerical experiments using a sinusoidal shear and measuring as response the density current . in section",
    "v we perform a diffusion vs. mobility experiment upon a tracer ( i.e. perturbing a single particle ) .",
    "finally section vi is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we simulate a gas of @xmath13 identical particles of unitary mass in a two - dimensional box of side @xmath14 with periodic boundary conditions . the particle collisions are inelastic : the total momentum is conserved , while the component of the relative velocity parallel to the direction joining the center of the particles is reduced to a fraction @xmath1 ( with @xmath15 ) of its initial value , lowering in this way the kinetic energy of the pair :    [ inelastic_collision ] @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the velocities of the colliding particles _ after _ the collision .    in the interval between two subsequent collisions , the motion of each particle @xmath19",
    "is governed by the following langevin equation  @xcite :    [ langevin ] @xmath20    where the function @xmath21 is a stochastic process with average @xmath22 and correlations @xmath23 ( @xmath5 and @xmath24 being component indexes ) , i.e. a standard white noise .",
    "this means that each particle feels a hot fluid with a temperature @xmath25 and a viscosity characterized by a time @xmath26 .",
    "the question about the most proper way of modeling a stochastic driving is still open .",
    "many authors for instance use eq .   without viscosity  @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the limit @xmath27 and @xmath28 with keeping @xmath29 constant . in this limit",
    "long and short - range correlations in the velocity and density fields have been observed  @xcite .",
    "we have measured correlations in the velocity field in the model with viscosity , concluding that they are highly reduced by the viscous term that breaks galilean invariance ( the frame @xmath30 is preferred )  @xcite .",
    "our choice of the stochastic driving with viscosity has the following advantages : a ) it guarantees that in the elastic limit ( @xmath31 ) the system , after a transient time of the order of @xmath26 , still reaches a stationary state , characterized by a uniform density and a gaussian distribution of velocities whith temperature @xmath25 ; b ) it is a heat bath with a well defined finite temperature @xmath25 that can be compared with the granular temperature @xmath3 and the effective temperature @xmath32 measured by means of fluctuation - dissipation relations ( see ahead ) .    in spite of the drastic reduction of velocity correlations , this model exhibits several interesting features which are parametrized by the restitution coefficient @xmath1 and the ratio , @xmath33 , between the mean free time ( the average interval of time between two subsequent collisions of the same particle ) and the viscosity time .",
    "when @xmath34 and @xmath35 the system is in a non - equilibrium stationary state with a granular temperature @xmath36 .",
    "this state is characterized  @xcite by fractal density clustering and non - gaussian distributions of velocities ( see fig.([dist_vel ] ) ) with a dependence upon @xmath1 and @xmath33 .",
    "this situation persists when direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc )  @xcite is used to perform more rapid and larger simulations of the system .",
    "the dsmc simulation scheme consists of a discrete time integration of the motion of the particles . at each time step of length @xmath37 the following operations",
    "are performed :    1 .",
    "free streaming _ : eq .",
    "is integrated for a time step @xmath37 disregarding possible interactions among the particles .",
    "_ collisions _ : every particle has a probability @xmath38 of undergoing a collision .",
    "its collision mate is chosen among the particles in a circle of fixed radius @xmath39 with a probability proportional to its relative velocity .",
    "the unitary vector @xmath40 , which should be parallel to the line joining the centers of particles , is chosen randomly instead and the collision is performed using rule  .",
    "in this section we review the kubo s formula , which must hold in the case of equilibrium dynamics .",
    "first we show the case of an hamiltonian dynamics , and then for non - hamiltonian equilibrium dynamics of a system subjected to an ( impulsive ) shear force .",
    "the first case is presented just for completeness and to set the notations , the formulas presented in the second case will be numerically checked for an elastic system and extended to the inelastic case in the next sections .      for an hamiltonian system ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the phase space distribution @xmath41 is ruled by the liouville equation :    @xmath42f(p , q , t)\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the liouville operators relative to the unperturbed hamiltonian and to its perturbation respectively .",
    "they are defined by means of classical poisson bracket :    @xmath45    the perturbation is assumed to be given by coupling a force @xmath46 with an observable of the system @xmath47 , i.e. :    @xmath48    the phase space distribution is assumed to be canonical ( i.e. at equilibrium ) in the infinite past : @xmath49 .",

    "to the aim of checking the whole numerical machinery , we first consider the @xmath31 elastic case . in all the cases",
    "investigated we have checked the linearity of the response by changing the perturbation amplitude in the range @xmath111 $ ] . within the specific framework chosen for the observables , the kubo formula to be verified is given by :    @xmath112    we have performed the following experiments :    * gas with elastic interactions and absence of thermal bath ( see figure  [ cicc_el ] ) .",
    "* gas with elastic interactions _ with _ the thermal bath ( see figure  [ cicc_el ] ) .    from figure  [ cicc_rc ] it",

    "obtaining again a very good agreement with equation   using @xmath115 .",
    "this is the main finding in this set of numerical experiments : even if the gas is out of equilibrium , being driven by a thermal bath at temperature @xmath116 , its unperturbed autocorrelation is still proportional to the linear response , and its effective temperature measured by means of fluctuation - dissipation theory is exactly the granular temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this is true for every inelasticity @xmath117 .    at lower inelasticities",
    "we have still obtained an agreement with equation   but with a @xmath118 : we do not think that these measures can be interesting , as the dsmc algorithm is not reliable at such values of @xmath1 .",
    "a real system of inelastic particles with @xmath119 should exhibit , even at low densities , a high degree of clusterization which can not be observed within the dsmc framework .",
    "it also must be noted that relation   is verified for many values of the wave number @xmath76 , i.e. the system does not show a scale dependent effective temperature .",
    "another independent confirmation of the validity of the modified linear response theory for granular gas comes from the study of the diffusion properties , i.e. of the large time behavior of the mean squared displacement @xmath120 . in this case",
    "the einstein relation is expected to hold @xmath121 , where @xmath122 : this relation however , often addressed as a sort of fd relation , is always verified and just represents a check of the correctness of the simulation . instead some surprise could arise from mobility measurements : a small static drag force ( switched on at time @xmath0 ) of intensity @xmath78 ( in the direction of the unitary vector @xmath123 of the @xmath124 axis ) is applied to a given particle ( tracer , e.g. particle with index @xmath8 and position @xmath125 ) .",
    "the tracer reaches , as a result of the viscous force generated by the gas surrounding it , a limit constant velocity such that @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the mobility which is expected to be related to the diffusion coefficient through the einstein relation @xmath128 ( if the force is applied on the direction @xmath124 in the two - dimensional system ) .    in our experiments",
    "we have checked the linearity of the relation between @xmath129 ( see fig .  [ diff_rc ] ) .",
    "in particular if kubo s formula was valid one should have :    @xmath130    with @xmath131 if the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature @xmath11 .",
    "in all the simulations we have checked the linearity of the response by changing the perturbation amplitude in the range @xmath132 $ ] .    figure  [ diff_rc ] shows the mean squared displacement ( in the unperturbed system ) and the @xmath124 displacement of the tracer ( when it is accelerated ) divided by the intensity of the perturbing force versus time : it can be appreciated how both these quantities grow linearly with time , defining the diffusion coefficient and the mobility .",
    "figures ( [ diff_1],[diff_2 ] ) report the parametric plots of the response to the force versus the mean squared displacement in the unperturbed system , showing how relation   is very well satisfied at different inelasticities . what can be observed in this kind of measures",
    "is a departure from the relation @xmath115 already at inelasticity @xmath133 ( i.e. where the check of fluctuation - dissipation theorem with the first type of measures still was positive ) : it appears that @xmath134 with @xmath135 . this breakdown of fluctuation - dissipation relation should be related to cluster formation ( i.e. spatial lack of homogeneity ) , which is present even in the case of dsmc solutions of boltzmann equation ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this violation is more pronounced than in the previous experiment , therefore appearing earlier , because this is a `` local '' measurement of fd , i.e. only one particle is perturbed : this means that the fluctuations of the local granular temperature strongly influence the trajectory of the tracer and its statistical properties .",
    "in conclusion in this paper we have investigated the validity of kubo s relations in driven granular gases in two dimensions .",
    "we have compared in particular two sets of measures . on the one hand",
    "we have measured the proportionality factor between the response of the staggered density current to an impulsive shear forcing and its autocorrelation function in the unperturbed system . on the other hand",
    "we have monitored the velocity of a tracer by checking the proportionality between its response to a small constant force , switched on at time @xmath0 , and its mean squared displacement in the unperturbed stationary state .    in both cases a proportionality",
    "is observed , in analogy with the linear response theory for equilibrium dynamics .",
    "furthermore the proportionality factor in the kubo formulas is equal to the inverse of th granular temperature ( at least for the restitution coefficients larger than @xmath136 ) , which hence plays the role of the equilibrium temperature in the elastic case .",
    "it is important to remark how these results are recovered by two completely independent measurement schemes .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first of all , though a granular gas is a non - trivial out - of - equilibrium system , from the point of view of its thermodynamics it exhibits properties which seem much simpler than the corresponding properties observed in a compacting granular medium . in this case in fact apparently no slow modes are present or at least their presence does not give raise to the existence of several effective temperatures depending on the time - scales investigated  @xcite . on the other hand the proportionality factor between response and autocorrelation we have found can not be considered a temperature from the point of view of equilibrium thermodynamics since it does not rely on any known statistical ensemble .",
    "another point to stress concerns the validity of the zeroth principle of thermodynamics .",
    "the question that immediately arises could be summarized as follows : if the granular temperature represents the correct temperature from the point of view of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , should we expect it rules the thermalization properties of two different granular gases put in contact ?",
    "as already mentioned the answer to this question is far from being trivial as witnessed by all recent results obtained on mixtures  @xcite where a lack of equipartition is observed .",
    "however these results ( validity of fluctuation - dissipation relations and lack of equipartition ) can coexist simply because heated granular gases have not only a thermal source but also a thermal sink ( dissipative collisions ) and therefore any zero principle should be stated in terms of a balance equation among energy fluxes instead of a strict equivalence between temperature of systems in contact .",
    "we again remark , also , that there are other common ways of driving a granular gas in a stationary state , e.g. stochastic driving without viscosity  @xcite , stochastic restitution coefficient models  @xcite , multiplicative noise models  @xcite and so on . in some of these models a more pronounced departure from homogeneity ( for example correlations in the velocity field  @xcite ) and therefore a breakdown of fluctuation - dissipation relations should be investigated .",
