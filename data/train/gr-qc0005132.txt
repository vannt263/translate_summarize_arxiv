    "the formation of a black - hole event horizon has attracted a great deal of attention on the part of physicists for a long time .",
    "an enormous amount of material has been written on this subject ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; nevertheless , the treatment of this problem within the general theory of relativity has created more questions than known solutions .",
    "one of the main questions concerning this problem is still the reciprocal influence of accreting matter on a black hole .",
    "the motion of test particles in the field of a black hole has been considered hitherto for the most part , but they , as we know , do not exhibit a reciprocal influence , which can be enormous when a falling particle achieves the speed of light as it crosses the event horizon .    * 1 . * in this paper",
    "we consider the special , but physically real case of spherically symmetric accretion on a central body without allowance for rotation .",
    "the following notation is adopted : the speed of light @xmath0 and the gravitational constant @xmath1 are set equal to unity . in these units",
    "the gravitational radius for a given mass @xmath2 is @xmath3 , i.e. , the radius of the event horizon in free space for the same mass concentrated at the center .",
    "let us devise a likely model for the evolution of the system .",
    "we assume that our system is a cooling massive star having a radius @xmath4 and a gravitational radius @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the matter comprising this body is initially at rest ( `` dust '' with the equation of state @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the pressure in the matter , @xmath9 is the energy density , and @xmath10 is a constant ) . in the next moment",
    "the matter begins to fall freely.@xcite@xmath11 if it is assumed that the gravitational fields are not excessively strong and that the dust density@xcite@xmath11 is fairly small in the initial moment , a force field with a finite energy is needed to retain it in the initial moment .",
    "after this field is removed , the dust leaves the system and ceases to interact with it after a time of the order of the size of the system , i.e. , after a time much shorter than the time during which the dust manages to partially settle and the gravitational fields increase dramatically .",
    "thus , this model is physically consistent .",
    "what subsequently happens to the system ?",
    "the dust begins to fall toward the center of the body , increasing its mean density and the gravitational radius @xmath12 for the mass @xmath13 at a certain radius @xmath14 .",
    "if we would neglect the reciprocal influence of the pressure of the moving matter on the dynamics of the system and on its gravitational field , then after all of the matter has unavoidably fallen and the inequality @xmath15 holds at one of the points @xmath14 of the system , an event horizon would form at that point according to schwarzchild s solution for a gravitational field in a vacuum , i.e. , the velocity of the falling matter relative to the @xmath16 surfaces would reach the speed of light ( see below ) .",
    "is this what actually happens ?",
    "the achievement of the speed of light by the matter causes a change in the sign of the interval and is therefore an invariant event , which does not depend on the choice of the reference frame .",
    "an attempt to solve this problem in a reference frame which is stationary at infinity leads at once to a contradiction .",
    "in fact , the analytically exact , nonstationary model , in principle , can not be studied .",
    "if , however , a simplification is made and it is assumed that the system is quasistationary at a certain moment in time in the range from one radius to a certain radius known to be large , but still far smaller than the dimensions of the system , then it can be stated , at the very least , that the components @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the metric have singularities ( zeros and poles ) in this reference frame.@xcite@xmath11 when the parameters of the system are chosen so that there would be a region in space where the inequality ( 1 ) is sure to be satisfied , it becomes clear that the metric does not have singularities , regardless of whether the inequality ( 1 ) is satisfied .",
    "this can be shown by assuming that if a singularity appears at a certain point @xmath19 , the component of the metric near it can be represented in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a certain number .",
    "when such a metric is substituted into the equations , it is found that they do not have a solution for any @xmath22 .",
    "this apparently indicates that the singularities and thus the horizon of the rapidly moving matter are eliminated ( the right - hand side of the einstein equations , which is equal to zero in a vacuum , becomes singular in the presence of ultrarelativistic falling matter when the radial component of the three - velocity tends to unity and the radial and temporal components of the four - velocity tend to infinity ; this is also the reason for the elimination of the singularities of the metric ) .",
    "however , in reality all this stems from the inapplicability of the quasistationary approximation in the case of strong gravitational fields .",
    "it is inapplicable because the passage of time in the system is highly nonuniform due to the nonuniformity of the component @xmath17 of the metric .",
    "this causes the picture , which appears to be stationary far from the center , to become highly nonstationary to an observer approaching the symmetry center of the system .    nevertheless , this does not remove the question posed : do an horizon and a black hole appear in the real nonstationary case",
    "an answer to the question posed can be found by selecting a comoving reference frame .",
    "the problem was solved in this frame in ref . 1 ( sec .",
    "103 ) in the special case of @xmath23 ( see below ) .",
    "matter is at rest in the reference frame chosen , and its motion can be evaluated only from the variation of the `` circumferential '' or photometric distances @xmath14 , which are related to the center of the system and are defined as the circumferences of the respective circles around the center : @xmath24 .",
    "when the radius @xmath14 is defined as such , it is convenient to represent the metric in the form @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the coordinate of a dust particle in the comoving reference frame or its index , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath14 are functions of @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is noteworthy that at zero pressure , i.e. , when @xmath23 , we have @xmath30 , i.e. , the reference frame is simultaneously synchronous .    to solve",
    "the problem posed we write out the einstein equation in the comoving reference frame : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 here @xmath35 , a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath26 , and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "equations ( 3 ) were derived in ref . @xcite [ eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) of problem 5 in sec .",
    "it follows from ( 3d ) that @xmath36 and that by transforming the time @xmath29 in the interval element ( 2 ) the function @xmath37 can be set equal to @xmath38\\ln \\varepsilon_*$ ] , where @xmath39 is a constant with the dimensions of energy density , which expresses the measurement scale of @xmath9 . then @xmath40 we next assign the indices @xmath26 to the dust particles so that @xmath41 in the initial moment . under such initial conditions",
    "@xmath42 corresponds to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the concentration of dust particles and @xmath45 is its value at the initial moment .",
    "let us now ascertain the conditions which must be imposed on the initial distribution of the dust .",
    "the most important among them is that the inequality ( 1 ) need not hold within the matter at the initial moment .",
    "it means that there is no horizon in all space in the initial moment .",
    "it thus imposes an upper limit on the initial density of the dust and on the initial dimensions of the system .",
    "more specifically , if the initial density distribution of the dust is set equal to @xmath46 , then , according to ( 1 ) , the maximum radius of the body @xmath47 is uniquely specified by the expression @xmath48 then , it follows from ( 3c ) and ( 4 ) that @xmath49 = 0\\ ] ] or @xmath50 , \\eqno{(6)}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is an arbitrary function that depends on the initial conditions .",
    "let us now find the initial values for all the variables in our problem .",

    "it follows that @xmath52 to find the initial value of @xmath53 we take advantage of the fact that the problem has already been solved for @xmath23 , and we can therefore utilize the familiar expression for @xmath54 from ref .",

    "this coincides with the results in sec .",
    "100 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the problem has already been solved for this case .",
    "finally , let us consider the location of the horizon@xcite@xmath11 in the presence of a nonzero pressure .",
    "for this purpose we plug the expressions ( 20 ) and ( 8) for @xmath91 into formula ( 17 ) .",
    "after some relatively simple transformations , we ultimately obtain @xmath92 as will be shown in appendix 1 , the horizon appears at the point and at the time where the velocity of the falling matter relative to the @xmath16 surfaces reaches unity , i.e. , where @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , the speed of light relative to the falling matter at this site is also , as always , equal to unity .",
    "hence , according to ( 24 ) and ( 9 ) , the horizon radius @xmath94 is given by the formula @xmath95 thus , the horizon is displaced to a larger radius in comparison to the value in a vacuum @xmath96 by @xmath97 . in this case",
    "the quantity @xmath98 has the meaning of the mass which would accumulate if we would join layers of dust with the initial radius @xmath26 and the thickness @xmath99 to one another up to the radius @xmath100 at the moment when this @xmath101 layer passes through the joining point .",
    "* 7 . * regarding the possible values of @xmath10 we note that @xmath23 corresponds to dustlike matter without interactions between the particles .",
    "the results obtained for them are the same [ see ( 23 ) ] as the results for test particles in a central field of mass @xmath2 ( see sec . 101 in ref .",
    "however , of course , such an equation of state of matter can not correspond to reality near the horizon .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the ultrarelativistic equation of state of matter , in which @xmath102 , holds near the horizon .",
    "therefore , the location of the horizon should probably be sought with just such a value of @xmath10 .",
    "* when @xmath103 , it would appear that the falling matter should be slowed under the action of the pressure gradient , and the horizon should therefore form later , i.e. , be displaced toward smaller values of @xmath14 , but , as we have just shown , it is displaced toward larger values of @xmath14 by @xmath97 .",
    "what is the reason for this contradiction ? it can be seen from the initial equations ( 3 ) that the reason should be sought in eq .",
    "for this purpose we explore eqs .",
    "( 3a ) and ( 4 ) in the initial moment for the case of @xmath104 . in that moment @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; therefore , we write @xmath107\\left(1 -2ar\\frac{\\varepsilon ' } { \\varepsilon}\\right ) - 2r\\tilde{r}\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon } { \\varepsilon_*}\\right)^{2\\alpha } \\approx 1 + 8\\pi\\alpha r^2\\varepsilon.\\ ] ] since @xmath108 then , after performing some relatively simple transformations , in the linear approximation with respect to @xmath10 we obtain @xmath109 - \\frac{\\nabla p}{\\rho}\\left[1 -   \\frac{2gm(r)}{rc^2}\\right ] - 4\\pi\\alpha gr\\rho , \\eqno{(26)}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the density of the matter . here , for the sake of clarity we use the ordinary ( gaussian )",
    "system of units with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "it can be seen from ( 26 ) that the first term corresponds to the ordinary newtonian force of gravity , and the second term corresponds to the interaction force between the particles , i.e , the pressure gradient ( just this force is the cause of the slowing of the fall of the matter in the first stage ) .",
    "the remaining terms do not appear in the equation of motion in the newtonian approximation ( the corrections in square brackets are also neglected in that case ) , but , as we have already seen , the last term begins to dominate over the second term at high energies ; therefore , a shift of the horizon toward larger radii appears .",
    "thus , the contradiction has been resolved .",
    "physically this corresponds to the `` gravity of pressure '' in the general theory of relativity , which surpasses the gradient terms at high energies .    *",
    "the analysis performed allows us to draw the following conclusions .",
    "first , a shift of the horizon toward a larger radius in comparison to the schwarzchild radius due to the `` gravity of pressure '' has been discovered .",
    "we stress that this effect is purely dynamic and is not observed in the static case ( after all the matter has fallen ) .",
    "second , according to the results in appendix 2 , the evolution of the entire system at a constant value of @xmath10 is completely specified by the energy density distribution profile in the initial moment , i.e. , for example , by the normalized density distribution of the matter and by the value of the parameter @xmath113 at an arbitrary point on this distribution .",
    "if the evolution of only one spherical layer of matter with the index @xmath26 must be described , it is completely specified by three dimensionless parameters in the initial moment in that layer and , in this sense , does not depend on the initial distribution of the matter in the system below and above that layer . however , this in no way signifies the independence of the spherical layers in the general case , since just these three parameters , as will be seen from appendix 2 , govern the interaction of the layers .",
    "consequently , integration of the system leads to a complete family of self - similar solutions .",
    "third , according to appendix 2 , a local extremum appears on the @xmath114 curve for a specific choice of initial parameters , and when @xmath115 , it leads to the formation of a second apparent horizon in the system ( an analog of the second horizon in the reissner ",
    "nordstrm and kerr  newman solutions for an electrically charged rotating static black hole ; for an interpretation of these solutions , see , for example , refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we have hitherto used the term horizon to refer to a trapping surface , or an apparent horizon , as it is called in the literature .",
    "let us ascertain the difference between an event horizon and an apparent horizon in greater detail in an example .",
    "we assume that we already have a stationary black hole of mass @xmath2 and that there is an apparent horizon at @xmath116 .",
    "now we assume that another chunk of matter with a mass @xmath117 falls into our black hole .",
    "after it falls , the radius of the apparent horizon increases to @xmath118 .",
    "thus , if an observer is placed between these radii before the additional chunk of matter falls , he would then be outside the black hole , but after the chunk of matter falls he would be inside it .",
    "the concept of an event horizon is global and is determined by the entire course of evolution of the black hole or , stated differently , by all the mass which falls into it at any time .",
    "the existence of an apparent horizon , which specifies a black hole locally , is sufficient for the existence of a black hole .",
    "as follows from our arguments , in the spherically symmetric case the two horizons ultimately coincide and form a static black hole described by schwarzchild s solution .",
    "therefore , we shall henceforth use the term horizon to refer to the apparent horizon .",
    "let us prove that the horizon in a system with spherical symmetry forms at the moment when a falling particle with a nonzero rest mass achieves the speed of light relative to the @xmath119 surfaces at the same point .",
    "for this purpose we write the law of motion for the particle in the form @xmath120 we now assume that we are located on a dust particle with the index @xmath121 and we are tracking a dust particle with the index @xmath122 , which sends us a light beam passing through the radii @xmath123 , from the large radius @xmath124 . the criterion for determining that the dust particle has not yet reached the horizon is the fact that we still see light from it , i.e. , the light propagating still crosses the radii @xmath125 . therefore , the criterion for determining that the dust particle has reached the horizon is an event in which the light propagating from @xmath122 can no longer cross the radii @xmath125 .",
    "let us express this criterion mathematically .",
    "[ 1 ]    in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] the vertical straight line @xmath126 denotes the world line of an @xmath122 dust particle in the coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath29 of the comoving reference frame from the moment of rest ( @xmath127 ) to the center of the system ( @xmath128 ) at @xmath129 . in this case of solid curves passing through points @xmath128 , @xmath130 , @xmath0 , and @xmath131 denote , respectively , lines of constant values of @xmath100 for @xmath129 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "the dashed lines emerging from these points denote the cones within which light emitted by the @xmath122 dust particle can propagate ( light can not propagate outside these cones ) .",
    "therefore , according to the criterion indicated above , the horizon forms at the point where the cone is tangent to the @xmath16 line . in the figure",
    "this line is designated as @xmath133 , and it passes through point @xmath0 . for clarity , fig .",
    "[ 1 ] shows that the light cone intersects lines with @xmath125 at point @xmath131 ; therefore , there is still no horizon at that point .",
    "this figure also shows that at point @xmath130 the light cone is located entirely above the @xmath16 curve passing through point @xmath130 .",
    "consequently , this light cone intersects only lines with @xmath135 , and therefore point @xmath130 is already located below the horizon .",
    "let us examine the expression ( 27 ) on one of the @xmath136 curves and take its complete differential on that curve : @xmath137 or @xmath138 next , differentiating ( 27 ) with respect to @xmath26 , we obtain the following expression for @xmath139 : @xmath140 with consideration of which from ( 28 ) we find @xmath141 thus , we have found an expression for the slope of an @xmath136 curve relative to the @xmath26 axis .    to find the slope of a light cone , by definition , for light we have @xmath142 .",
    "hence , from ( 2 ) it follows that @xmath143 according to the foregoing statements , the criterion for the absence of a horizon is the condition @xmath144 substituting the expressions ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) therein and taking into account ( 17 ) , we obtain this criterion in the form @xmath145 here , according to ( 29 ) , the rate of motion of the matter relative to the @xmath16 lines has the form @xmath146    thus , the assertion that a horizon forms at the moment when the matter achieves the velocity @xmath147 relative to the @xmath136 surfaces has been proved .",
    "the horizon surface separates regions in which @xmath14 is space - similar and time - similar .",
    "to solve the equations describing collapse , we first bring them into dimensionless forms . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following notation : @xmath148    in this appendix we find the ranges of permissible values of @xmath149 and @xmath113 , investigate the character of collapse at these values of the parameters , and obtain numerical solutions for @xmath150 .",

[ 3 ] . as it should be , according to ( 25 ) , the plots of @xmath222 are displaced upward and to the right as @xmath10 is increased from @xmath85 to @xmath102 .",

    "[ 2 ] and the region where @xmath198 is located below and to the left of these curves , the point @xmath231 should be a local maximum on the @xmath233 curve for a constant value of @xmath29 .        when the equations of the model were brought into dimensionless form , it was found that the solution for a spherical layer of matter with the index @xmath26 is completely specified by three dimensionless parameters in the initial moment in that layer : @xmath185 , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 .",
    "this corresponds to assigning the initial conditions for the gravitational potential and two parameters which determine the distribution of the matter and the pressure gradient near the point under consideration .",
    "thus , upon integration we at once find a whole family of self - similar solutions,@xcite@xmath11 which can be characterized by these three parameters alone and which contains the dependence on the other layers of matter above and below the radius @xmath26 considered .",

    "when there is an horizon , the components of the metric in the reference frame which is stationary at infinity , like the schwarzchild metric , must acquire singularities as the surface of that horizon is approached . here",
