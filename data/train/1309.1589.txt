    "in spite of years of rigorous research , a reliable _ ab - initio _ theoretical model for structural and/or substitutional disordered alloys is still lacking .",
    "more importantly , the understanding of the problem of lattice dynamics ( or phonons ) in disordered alloys is still in its adolescence .",
    "this is mainly due to the presence of off - diagonal ( multisite ) disorder arising out of the force constant tensor @xmath0 in the phonon problem .",
    "in addition the sum rule @xmath1 makes the disorder at a site depend upon its neighborhood or the so called environmental disorder . as such first principles method based on e.g. coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite is inapplicable in this problem . within cpa ,",
    "the atoms occupancy are assumed in an average sense embedded in a structure - less uniform average medium .",
    "this prohibits cpa to include structural relaxations , which contrasts from the experimental observations because bond distance between atomic pairs ( e.g. a - a , b - b , and a - b in a binary alloy ) are generally different.@xcite various generalizations@xcite of cpa have been suggested over time , each has its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "an striking approach , emerged in recent years , is the so called special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) proposed by zunger _",
    "@xcite , which carries the signature of configuration correlation with them .",
    "in particular , sqs is an ordered supercell which is constructed in such a way to mimic the most relevant pair and multisite correlation functions of the disordered phase . unlike cpa and other related approaches",
    ", sqs is a local structural model which captures the most relevant microstates of disordered phase .    as far as the calculation of force constants for random alloys",
    "are concerned , three approaches are mainly utilized in the past .",
    "the first attempt@xcite was to fit an empirical set of force constants to match the available experimental phonon spectra .",
    "the second approach was to compute the force constants from selected ordered structures and then use them for random alloys.@xcite this is of course not a proper solution , because dynamical matrices are not directly transferable across the environment .",
    "@xcite in later studies@xcite , few sqs methods have been used , but only @xmath2-atoms cell were used which is not enough to capture the detailed properties of phonons , as illustrated in the present work .",
    "in addition to a reliable estimate of the force constants , equally important is the need for a method to perform configuration average over the disorder environment to get the phonon spectra , dos etc . for the alloys .",
    "augmented space formalism ( asf)@xcite is a powerful technique to do the same , and has been described in great details in many of our earlier papers .",
    "interested readers are referred to articles for any details related to formalism . in the present rapid communication ,",
    "we integrate a firs principles sqs method with the asf to demonstrate the interplay of force constants within a disorder environment .",
    "unlike previous approaches , a systematic calculation of the force constants with increasing size of the sqs cell is made .",
    "stress on the atomic sites are directly related to the force constant matrix and hence a small disturbance leads to a large change . to overcome this effect",
    ", we use the sqs cell in conjunction with the _ small displacement method_@xcite to construct the dynamical matrix @xmath3 . based on the predicted bond length distribution and the calculated force constants for each pairs a -",
    "a , b - b , and a - b , it is concluded that a minimum of @xmath4-atom sqs cell is needed to capture the important disorder correlations , and hence a reliable phonon dispersion .",
    "two different alloy systems , bcc taw and fcc nipt , are chosen to demonstrate the reliability of the approach .",
    "both the systems have inelastic neutron scattering data to compare our theoretical results .",
    "ta and w belong to @xmath5d - metal series with similar size and atomic masses , but quite different force constants .",
    "ni and pt on the other hand differ significantly in size ( @xmath6 ) , masses ( pt is @xmath7-times heavier than ni ) as well as force constants ( @xmath8 is @xmath9 larger than @xmath10 ) . as such considerable differences are expected from the lattice dynamical properties of the two systems , with different interplay of force constant interactions .",
    "we compare our calculated dynamical matrices , phonon dispersion and dos with existing experimental and theoretical data , wherever available .",
