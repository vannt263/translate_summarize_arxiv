    "the correlators of the bare fields and composite operators in lattice simulations are not completely physical .",
    "their amplitudes depend on the details of the action used in the simulation and from the actual form of the operators involved . to be able to compare different simulations ( with different lattice spacings , actions , operators , etc . ) and also to compare the numerical results with perturbation theory one needs some convention to bring these quantities to a `` common denominator '' . for that purpose",
    "one has to introduce renormalization constants , and define the renormalized fields and operators .",
    "these will not depend any more on the microscopic details ( apart from the discretization errors ) but will depend on how the renormalization conditions have been chosen , i.e. on the renormalization scheme",
    ".    in continuum perturbation theory one generally uses dimensional regularization and the @xmath1 scheme to fix the convention of removing ( factoring out ) the divergencies . in lattice simulations",
    "this method is not applicable , and to be able to connect to the @xmath1 scheme one has to use some condition to define the renormalized fields in a way which is independent of the actual regularization .",
    "such scheme is the non - perturbative rome - southampton ri / mom technique @xcite . in this scheme one",
    "fixes some renormalized green s functions to their free theory counterpart at some scale @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the momentum of external particles and @xmath4 is an appropriately chosen scale .",
    "qcd has an extra complication due to gauge invariance : the quark correlators are not gauge invariant , hence they average to zero when integrated over different gauge - equivalent copies . therefore in the ri / mom scheme one uses a gauge fixing condition to make sense of the green s functions with external quark legs .",
    "this follows closely the perturbation theory where one has to fix the gauge anyhow .",
    "the ri / mom scheme has become the standard way of fixing the renormalization constants , and has an extended literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", there are many versions to formulate the same renormalization condition .",
    "these coincide in the continuum limit but contain different lattice artefacts .",
    "we believe we found a specific artefact which can have a large effect on the renormalization constant and ( as far as we know ) all actual definitions used in the literature suffer from it .",
    "fortunately , one can cure the problem in a simple way .",
    "we discuss the issue for the case of the overlap dirac operator where this artefact is most transparent .",
    "however , the problem ( and the cure ) is general .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : after stating the conventions we describe the landau gauge fixing , and suggest a simplification related to the remaining global gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "the artefact in the renormalization constants is discussed in detail on the example of the quark field and the composite bilinear operators .",
    "having modified the matching relations , we compare different choices for the renormalization constants of the quark field and of the covariant scalar density in an actual simulation done on a @xmath5 lattice with 2 + 1 light flavors with the fixed point ( fp ) action .",
    "we use the following conventions for the renormalization constants . the renormalized fermion field",
    "is related to the bare field as @xmath6 while the renormalization factor for local operators enters as @xmath7 to implement the ri / mom scheme a gauge fixing is necessary .",
    "one averages then the propagators over the gauge - fixed configurations .",
    "the fermion propagator on a given gauge field configuration is denoted by @xmath8 and its gauge - field average by @xmath9 according to eq .",
    "this is renormalized as @xmath10      eq .   and other gauge - field averaged non - gauge - invariant correlation functions considered below assume gauge fixing .",
    "we use the landau gauge which is defined by maximizing the sum @xmath11 with respect to gauge transformations . here",
    "@xmath12 is the lattice gauge field variable . in the continuum limit",
    "this condition is reduced to @xmath13 .    a global gauge transformation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is independent of @xmath16 , rotates the gauge fields while keeping the value of the functional in eq .",
    "the extent of the effective averaging in this global degree of freedom by the available configurations depends not only on the number of configurations , but also on the actual algorithm for fixing the gauge .",
    "it is useful and natural to integrate over @xmath17 explicitly .",
    "consider , as an example , the propagator @xmath18 on a given configuration . performing a global gauge transformation",
    "we get @xmath19 when we are interested in @xmath20 , which is the average of the individual propagators over the gauge fields in landau gauge , as argued above , we can additionally average this quantity over the global gauge freedom .",
    "this `` color averaging '' amounts to replacing the color sub - matrices ( at given dirac indices ) by @xmath21 matrices which are trivial in color , according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the unit color matrix and @xmath24 denotes trace in color indices .    in the following",
    "we shall perform an additional color averaging whenever an averaging over gauge fields is done . in other words",
    "the gauge - field averaged green s functions will be considered to be @xmath25 matrices having only dirac indices .",
    "note that to perform a color averaging is mainly a matter of convenience , it is easier to work with @xmath25 than with @xmath26 matrices . in practice",
    "the actual color sub - matrices are already nearly proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the ri / mom technique @xcite consists of imposing the condition that some renormalized green s functions at a given scale @xmath2 are equal to their corresponding tree level values .",
    "one would like to connect this renormalization scheme to other schemes by using perturbation theory and , at the same time , control the cut - off effects on the lattice .",
    "these conditions constrain the scale @xmath4 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a typical non - goldstone boson mass scale in qcd .",
    "we can formulate an analogous condition in configuration space by requesting that the renormalized green s functions should be matched at distances @xmath30 , where @xmath31 since in full qcd applications eq .",
    "is satisfied only marginally one needs further decisions in the applications in order to avoid large cut - off effects .",
    "we shall illustrate this cut - off effect and the way to eliminate it in the context of the quark field renormalization factor @xmath33 which is defined in the so called @xmath34 scheme .",
    "scheme one uses @xmath35 while the ri scheme uses @xmath36 in the matching condition . ] in this case the green s function considered is just the propagator in fourier space given by @xmath37 the generalization to green s functions with a bilinear operator will be treated the next section .    following the general procedure of matching with the free theory one might request @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the inverse of the dirac operator on the trivial gauge configuration @xmath40 and @xmath41",

    "if @xmath41 satisfies eq .   and the statistical error in the simulation is small , one might expect that all elements of this matrix equation can be ( approximately ) matched by a single parameter @xmath42 .",
    "this , however , does not hold in general .",
    "the symmetries of the lattice action and the gauge fixing condition imply that only the @xmath43 and @xmath44 clifford algebra elements enter in the propagator @xmath45 the presence of the unit @xmath25 matrix @xmath43 is related to the @xmath46 anomaly and the problem of doublers  @xcite .",

    "in particular , consider the simplest case given by neuberger s overlap dirac operator @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a real number of order 1 .",
    "these equations imply that the coefficient of the unit dirac matrix @xmath43 in the propagator @xmath52 is @xmath53 . averaging over the gauge configurations @xmath54 in landau gauge",
    "gives @xmath55 the expectation value @xmath56 depends only on @xmath57 in a periodic box .",

    "would give @xmath65 , which is obviously nonsense . eqs .   and give the explanation : @xmath64 is @xmath66 , a pure cut - off effect in this context .",
    "in addition , @xmath67 violates eq .  . obviously ,",
    "the @xmath43 part of the propagator , whose presence is absolutely essential to avoid doublers and get exact chiral symmetry , should not be taken ( alone , or in combinations with the @xmath44 part ) in determining @xmath32 . for this reason the conventional matching condition proposed in @xcite and widely used in the literature , @xmath68 is plagued by this artefact since the @xmath44 part of @xmath35 , unlike the @xmath44 part of @xmath61 , contains @xmath69 .",

    "in the arguments above we discussed the case of the overlap operator . in this case the considerations are fully transparent .",
    "the message is , however , general : the @xmath43 part of the propagator @xmath71 is a special cut - off effect which should not enter the renormalization conditions .    to illustrate the point we use the results from the simulations with 2 + 1 light fermions on a @xmath5 lattice , using the fixed point ( fp ) dirac operator at lattice spacing @xmath0 @xcite    we plot in fig .",
