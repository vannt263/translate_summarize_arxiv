    "let @xmath9 be six points in the real projective plane and consider the pencil of nodal cubics determined by these points with node at one of them , say @xmath1 .",
    "this pencil has five reducible cubics plus , possibly , some cuspidal cubics .",
    "we ignore the latter and consider the sequence of reducible cubics .",
    "let us call combinatorial cubic a topological type ( cubic , points ) , up to the following identification : a loop passing through no other point than the node will be assimilated to an isolated node .",
    "let us call combinatorial pencil the cyclic sequence of five combinatorial reducible cubics , they are of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "a set of six or seven points is in generic position if no three are aligned and no six are coconic .",
    "consider first six points , five of them determine @xmath12 lines and one conic , dividing @xmath13 in @xmath14 zones .",
    "the _ arrangement _ of @xmath0 is any one of the six equivalent pieces of information : cyclic ordering of five chosen points on their conic and zone containing the sixth one .",
    "another equivalent information is the list of six combinatorial pencils of cubics based at @xmath0 , with respective nodes at @xmath0 .",
    "configuration _ of six points is an equivalence class of arrangements for the action of the group @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider now seven points @xmath6 .",
    "for a point @xmath15 among the seven , we denote by @xmath16 the arrangement of the other six points .",
    "an arrangement of seven points is the set @xmath17 of arrangements realized by six of the points .",

    ". otherwise stated , six generic points may realize four different configurations .",
    "seven generic points @xmath6 in @xmath13 may realize fourteen different configurations .",
    "up to the action of @xmath7 , there are correspondingly fourteen possible lists of seven combinatorial nodal cubics through the seven points , with respective nodes at @xmath6 .",
    "theorem  1 is proved in section 2.1 , theorem  2 is proved in sections 3.1 and 3.2 .",
    "the same results have been obtained independently by arzu zabun with a different method ( private communication ) .",
    "acknowledgement : i am grateful to arzu zabun and sergey finashin for pointing out to me that one configuration of theorem  2 was missing in the previous version of this paper .",
    "_ proof of theorem  1 : _ up to the action of @xmath2 on @xmath18 , we may assume that the six points are disposed as shown in figure  [ conf ] , where @xmath19 lie in this ordering on a conic , and @xmath1 is in one of the zones @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 .",
    "we perform a cremona transformation @xmath22 with base points @xmath23 .",
    "let us denote the respective images of the lines @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath1 .",
    "for the other points , we keep the same notation as before @xmath29 .",
    "the three conics @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are mapped onto three lines @xmath14 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , see upper part of figure  [ doublint ] .",
    "after @xmath29 , let us consider the pencil of conics @xmath35 , and five particular conics of this pencil : the three double lines and the two conics passing respectively through @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the cyclic ordering of these conics in the pencil is easily determined .",
    "perform the cremona transformation back .",
    "the pencil of conics @xmath35 is mapped onto the pencil of nodal cubics based at @xmath0 with node at @xmath1 .",
    "the five particular conics are mapped onto the five reducible cubics .",
    "we repeat this procedure for the various positions of @xmath36 , with a cremona transformation based either in @xmath37 or in @xmath38 , see figures  [ doublint]-[doublext ] .",
    "the sequences of five particular conics are displayed in figure  [ conics ] .",
    "the sequences of five reducible cubics for each case @xmath20 are shown in figure  [ seven ] , the pencils are drawn in figures  [ cubnod]-[nodext ] .",
    "more precisely , we have represented the successive types of combinatorial cubics in the five portions bounded by the reducible cubics .",
    "the upper middle pictures of each pencil @xmath39 are not quite correct : in the actual pencils , the portion starts and finishes with cubics having a loop containing no base point other than @xmath1 .",
    "inbetween , there is a pair of cuspidal cubics , and in the middle , cubics with an isolated node .",
    "we have represented only the latter .",
    "consider any one of these seven pencils .",
    "we observe the following properties : the cyclic ordering of the points @xmath47 is the same on each of the five types of non - reducible cubic , it is given by the pencil of lines based at @xmath1 , this follows from bezout s theorem .",
    "the cyclic ordering of @xmath47 given by the lines of the successive reducible cubics is the same as the cyclic ordering of these points on the conic that they determine .",
    "the mutual cyclic orderings of @xmath47 given on one hand by the conic @xmath48 , on the other hand by the pencil of lines based at @xmath1 , are displayed in the marked diagrams of figure  [ markdiag ] , where the circles represent the conics .",
    "let us now consider together all six pencils of cubics with nodes at @xmath0 .",
    "if we take @xmath1 in one of the zones @xmath49 exterior to the conic @xmath48 , then we note that @xmath50 lies inside of the conic determined by the other five points .",
    "so , up to the action of @xmath4 , we may assume that @xmath1 is interior to a conic @xmath48 .",
    "there are four lists of six pencils , giving rise to four configurations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , see figure  [ four ] . for a given list ,",
    "each choice of a point @xmath0 gives rise to a diagram , it turns out that all six unmarked diagrams of a list are identical , and each list corresponds to a different diagram as shown in the upper part of figure  [ diagrams ] .",
    "note that the unmarked diagrams remain also unchanged if the roles of the circle and of the polygonal line are swapped .",
    "@xmath55    the space @xmath56 , enhanced with the natural stratification given by the alignment of three points , has four cameras and three walls , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cameras correspond to the four configurations .",
    "refine the stratification with the conics , one supplementary wall appears inside of the camera @xmath52 .",
    "the _ adjacency graph _ is obtained assigning a vertex to each camera and an edge to each wall , see figure  [ diagrams ] ."
