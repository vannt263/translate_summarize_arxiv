    "the evidences to support the existence of a vortex glass ( vg ) phase in strongly disordered type - ii superconductors have been reported in many experiments by the dynamic scaling of the measured current - voltage data@xcite . theoretically , the xy gauge glass model@xcite is often used to describe the vg phase , although it lacks some of properties and symmetries due to the absence of net magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "now there is general consensus that a finite - temperature vg transition occurs in the three - dimensional gauge glass model @xcite .",
    "the situation is , however , much less clear in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the experimental quest of the vg transition in high-@xmath3 cuprate films@xcite has provided continuous excitement and puzzles .",
    "recently , in a positionally disordered josephson junction arrays with the maximal disorder strength@xcite , where the 2d gauge glass model is realized , a possible finite - temperature glass transition has been observed experimentally . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the existence of a finite - temperature glass transition in the 2d gauge glass model remains a topic of controversy@xcite .",
    "it is predicted that , in the zero - temperature numerical renormalization group studies of domain walls and the calculations of stiffness exponents , there is no ordered phase at any finite temperature in 2d@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite - temperature glass transition ( @xmath4 ) has also been spported by extensive resistively - shunted - junction ( rsj ) dynamic simulations @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the depinning transition at zero temperature and the creep motion at low temperatures have attracted considerable attention both analytically@xcite and numerically@xcite in a large variety of physical systems , such as charge density waves in solids , field - driven motion of domain walls in ferromagnets and flux lines in type - ii superconductors .",
    "since the non - linear dynamic response in these systems produces a rich physical picture , there has been increasing interest in studies of these phenomena .    in this paper ,",
    "based on the rsj dynamics , we perform large - scale dynamic simulations on the 2d gauge glass model .",
    "both the glass transition temperature @xmath5 and the critical exponents are estimated .",
    "the depinning transition at zero temperature and the creep motion below @xmath5 are also investigated . the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the above equations can be solved efficiently by a pseudo - spectral algorithm @xcite due to the periodicity of the phase in all directions .",

    "the time - averaged voltages are calculated over a long - time scale after reaching the steady state . to determine the steady state ,",
    "we have checked @xmath30 for every @xmath31 time steps .",
    "we assume that the system reaches a steady state when the fluctuation of the mean voltage @xmath32 is less than @xmath33 for several @xmath34 s after @xmath35 .",
    "once this criterion is satisfied , we record the @xmath36 as the final estimate of the voltage @xmath37 .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is typically @xmath38 in the present simulations .",
    "the detailed procedure in the simulations was described in ref .",
    "we have performed simulations with 10 different realizations of disorder and observed that the results are quite close from sample to sample , so good self - averaging effects exist in the present large systems .",

    "while at higher temperatures , @xmath45 tends to a finite value , corresponding to ohmic resistivity in the vortex liquid .",
    "these observations reveal strong evidence of the existence of the low - temperature glass phase in the 2d gauge glass model .    assuming that the vg transition is continuous and characterized by the divergence of the characteristic length and time scales @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the dynamic exponent ) , fisher , fisher , and huse @xcite proposed the following dynamic scaling ansatz to analyze the glass transition from a vortex liquid with ohmic resistivity to a superconducting glass state @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dimension of the system ( @xmath50 in this paper ) , @xmath51 is the correlation length which diverges at the transition and @xmath52 are scaling functions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",

( [ ffh ] ) slightly by removing temperature @xmath67 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath68 were obtained .",

    "based on the analysis of data at temperatures above @xmath69 , previous rsj simulations@xcite with an open boundary condition in the 2d gauge glass model demonstrated a zero - temperature criticality .",
    "it has been shown that the voltage drop next to the boundary regime is particularly large and dominates the total voltage drop across the sample at low currents@xcite .",
    "therefore , one should measure the voltage drop inside the sample@xcite .",
    "so the conclusion based on the total voltage drop across the system with the open boundary condition@xcite may not be reliable .",
    "interestingly , in experiments on nb wire networks@xcite , the critical exponents @xmath70 were obtained for high filling factors @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , which are very close to the present value .",

    ", the current - voltage characteristics are rounded near the zero - temperature critical current due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "an obvious crossover between the depinning and creep motion can be observed around @xmath81 at lower accessible temperatures . in order to address the thermal rounding of the depinning transition ,",
    "fisher@xcite first suggested to map this system to ferromagnets in fields where the second - order phase transitions occur .",
    "this mapping was later extended to the random - field ising model@xcite and flux lines in type - ii superconductors@xcite .",
    "if the voltage is identified as the order parameter , the current and temperature are equivalent to the inverse temperature and the field in ferromagnetic systems , respectively , analogous to the second - order phase transitions , a scaling relation among the voltage , current and temperature in the present model should follow the form @xmath82,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is a scaling function with @xmath84const .",

    "a perfect collapse of the data for temperatures @xmath95 , far below @xmath69 , to a single curve for currents less than @xmath89 is clearly shown .",
    "this collapse can be fitted well to an exponential function @xmath96exp@xmath97 , which is also plotted in the fig.[fig6 ] with a solid line . note that the product of the two exponents @xmath98 describes the temperature dependence of the creep law .",

    "two perfect collapses of simulated current - voltage data are achieved with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath47 are in agreement with those in the previous equilibrium monte carlo simulations . while the value of @xmath62 is larger than that in literature , which is , however , closer to that in experiments in the gauge glass limit .",
    "we have also studied the depinning transition at zero temperature and creep motion at low temperatures in detail .",
    "a genuine continuous depinning transition is observed at zero temperature . with the notion of scaling and the critical exponents obtained from the simulations at zero temperature and at the critical current",
    ", a perfect collapse of the current - voltage data at low temperatures is exhibited .",
    "the value of @xmath98 deviates from unity and the scaling curve is fitted well by an exponential function , suggesting a non - arrhenius type creep motion in the glass phase of the 2d gauge glass model .",
    "it is worthy to note that in this model the current - voltage characteristics in the whole temperature regime below @xmath5 can almost be described in the framework of two critical phenomena .",
    "one is the thermal rounding of the depinning transition , which is a second - order - like phase transition .",
