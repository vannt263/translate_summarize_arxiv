    "the total number of different applied frequencies is @xmath114 . for each frequency",
    ", the sets of different duration have to be applied in order to obtain the time evolution .",
    "the result for the heating function is obtained by converting the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genave ] ) to a sum over the sets of applied electric pulses .",
    "the result of the summation has excellent agreement with the exact and theoretical quantum simulator results of fig .",
    "[ fig : parts ] ( d ) , and to avoid repetition we have not plotted in this figure the third overlapping curve .",
    "instead it is worth mentioning that the x - axis of the figure , for the chosen experimental parameters , corresponds to @xmath115s time scale .",
    "the system - reservoir coupling constant is directly proportional to the intensity of the applied field and the dimensioless coupling constant appearing in the analytical solution is directly given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the amplitude of the applied field and @xmath118 the charge of the ion .",
    "actually , one can choose the intensity for each set of drives @xmath0 in the most convenient way for the experimental implementation .",
    "this is because the used intensities can be rescaled when calculating the average over the frequencies for the heating function .",
    "in other words , the intensity dependence @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phaseave ] ) stands outside the integration and can be taken outside of the corresponding summation of the experimental results .",
    "it is also worth noting that the ambient reservoir does not disturb the experiment since its effect occurs on few orders of magnitude larger time scale  @xcite .",
    "the vibrational quantum number of the ion can be measured in the standard way  @xcite .",
    "the displacement scheme presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : drive ] has straightforward implications for interpreting the ion simulator results .",
    "a sudden switch on and off of the electric field displaces the centre of the ion trap due to interaction between the charge of the ion and the electric field .",
    "the central point is that in the adiabatic regime , the center of the trap moves slowly compared to the oscillator frequency , and the ion follows adiabatically the motion of the trap center .",
    "this effect plays a key role in the damping of the heating function in the experiment .",
    "in the past , the average over the stochastic fields has been used to describe the effects of ambient reservoirs to the oscillator dynamics , e.g.  the heating of the ground state of trapped ions  @xcite . here , we use similar displacement operator based formalism to investigate a new aspect to the topic .",
    "we ask the opposite question : how can controlled drives and their average be used to model the effects of a reservoir ?",
    "in fact , we demonstrate how to use controlled drives to mimic the effects of both the ambient and the artificial engineered reservoirs .",
    "in addition of the developed quantum simulator , the used approach brings to light some interesting features of the open system dynamics .",
    "we have been dealing with a characteristic quantum mechanical non - lindblad - type master equation  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is somewhat surprising that the oscillations of the heating function , a typical quantum mechanical dynamical feature , have a semiclassical interpretation , when the simulator is implemented with a trapped ion .",
    "namely , the source of the oscillations , according to our interpretation , can be seen in the displacement  coherent state dynamics ",
    "displacement   scheme described in sec .",
    "[ sec : drive ] .",
    "in contrast , usually the oscillatory behavior of the heating function and non - lindblad - type  dynamics are connected to the appearance of virtual processes  @xcite .",
    "the results also illuminate the role of the random phase of the environment fields . in the case of oscillatory non - markovian dynamics",
    ", the role of the random phase is to affect the amplitude of the short time oscillations .",
    "the oscillation is initiated by the low frequency fields and its amplitude is given by an average over the effects of the random phase of the same frequencies .",
    "the oscillations are then damped because of the various frequencies involved . for strictly markovian case ,",
    "the phase plays hardly any role .",
    "our results also shed some light on the problem of the existence of a continuos measurement scheme interpretation of the quantum trajectories for non - lindbad - type dynamics . in the lindblad case",
    "there is a direct correspondence between the continuos measurement scheme of the environment and the quantum trajectories generated by the computer simulations  @xcite . for the non - lindblad case a completely satisfactory connection is still lacking despite of some attempts  @xcite , and this important problem",
    "remains open .",
    "thus , it is interesting to note that , in order to observe the oscillations of the heating function with the quantum simulator described here , the act of switching off the field ( second displacement ) has a crucial role .",
    "no measurements are allowed while the driving field is on .",
    "this points to the direction that it is probable that a satisfactory measurement scheme interpretation for non - lindblad type dynamics does not exist , at least not in the framework of conventional quantum theory .",
    "it might be interesting to study in the future what the measurement scheme interpretations based on alternative formulations of quantum mechanics  @xcite would say in the context of the quantum simulator proposed here .",
    "it is important to note that most of the existing analytical methods to study open system dynamics rely on various approximations , e.g.  weak coupling between the system and the environment  @xcite .",
    "it would be extremely stimulating for the research on open quantum systems to possess a general quantum simulator which could be used in the regimes where most of the approximations used in the analytical calculations fail .",
    "we have taken an initial step towards this direction and a more general quantum simulator for open systems will be a challenging task for our future studies .    in conclusion , we have shown how to use a controlled driven harmonic oscillator to simulate the behavior of a damped oscillator . in other words ,",
    "our results demonstrate the possibility of studying one of the paradigmatic open quantum systems models by means of a closed quantum system . moreover",
    ", we have discussed in detail the implementation of the quantum simulator with single trapped ions .",
    "in addition , the simulator approach illuminates several interesting aspects of the non - markovian dynamics of a damped oscillator , most notably identifying the role that the various parts of the non - markovian spectrum play in the system dynamics .",
