    "with the success of the kepler and k-2 missions and ground - based follow - up efforts of the brightest targets , significant strides have been made in understanding the size and density distribution of planets around other stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , most of these likely rocky planets have been found at very close orbital periods and are therefore significantly hotter than the earth .",
    "some of these planets receive orders of magnitude more stellar insolation than the earth , and their atmospheres will be sculpted and altered by interactions with the stellar insolation , particularly the high energy extreme ultra - violet ( xuv , 1 - 120 nm ) radiation",

    "@xcite applied this type of model to rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of m and k dwarf stars , where may be a biosignature mimic .    in the present paper , we also study atmospheric loss and oxygen build up , but we extend previous models by including an interior model that allows for uptake of by the planet s mantle .",
    "our interior model includes both a magma ocean stage , as well as parameterized solid state convection with passive outgassing following solidification .",

    "we discuss some of the limitations of the model . finally , in section [ sec : predictions ] , we give predictions for the atmospheric composition of gj 1132 b.",
    "as in the solar system , atmospheric erosion from young planets around m dwarfs will be driven by a combination of xuv - driven hydrodynamic escape , erosion by coronal mass ejection events ( cmes ) , blowoff by giant impacts , and a host of more complex processes involving non - thermal effects , ion - pickup and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the early xuv emission from most m dwarfs is high for an extended period , making xuv - driven hydrodynamic escape one of the most critical effects to model .",
    "as it is also more straightforward to calculate escape rates in this case than for many other processes , we focus on it here .    for a planet undergoing xuv - driven hydrodynamic",
    "escape , the atmospheric escape flux ( kg / m@xmath5/s ) is approximately given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the stellar flux in the xuv wavelength range ( 1 - 120  nm ) and @xmath8 is the gravitational potential at the base of the escaping region . here we take @xmath9 with @xmath10 the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 the estimated planetary radius and mass of gj 1132 b , respectively ( see table  [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 is an empirical factor that accounts for radiative losses and 3d effects and typically varies between 0.15 and 0.3 @xcite .",
    "equation  [ eq : elim2 ] neglects the expansion of the heated upper atmosphere away from the planet s surface , which typically results in a correction factor of up to a few tens of percent .",
    "equation  [ eq : elim ] also assumes that re - emission of absorbed xuv radiation at infrared wavelengths is not effective .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for a hydrogen - dominated upper atmosphere , but not if the upper atmosphere is dominated by a gas with strong vibrational and rotational modes such as .",
    "we also neglect tidal enhancement of the escape flux @xcite , which is likely a much smaller effect than the uncertainty in the xuv flux .",
    "the total mass of atmosphere lost as a fraction of the final planet mass is @xmath14 here we are assuming @xmath15 , so that @xmath12 and @xmath11 can be treated as approximately independent of time in eqn ( [ eq : mlost ] ) .",
    "the present - day xuv flux from gj 1132 has not yet been measured .",
    "however , the star gj 1214 ( 0.15 m@xmath16 ) is similar in mass to gj 1132 ( 0.181 m@xmath16 ) and has a similar activity level @xcite . as such",
    ", we use the semi - empirical high - energy spectrum of gj 1214 constructed by @xcite as a proxy for that of gj 1132 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stellar_flux ] ) .",
    "the nuv - to - fuv portion of this spectrum was directly observed with hubble cos and stis @xcite , the euv was estimated from a model - dependent scaling from the lyman @xmath17 emission line @xcite , and the x - ray from a plasma model matched to an earlier xmm detection of a flare from gj 1214 @xcite . in this spectrum , the xuv flux ( 1 - 120 nm ) represents about 3 @xmath18 of the bolometric flux , with an additional 3 @xmath18 of the bolometric flux contributed by the lyman @xmath17 line alone ( 120 - 130 nm ) .",
    "based on scaling from gj 1214 , we estimate that gj 1132 b currently receives about 0.8 w / m@xmath19 in the xuv .",
    "the xuv flux could be at least @xmath20 above or below this value , due both to uncertainties in reconstructing gj 1214 s intrinsic spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to the unknown extent to which gj 1132 s high energy behavior tracks that of gj 1214 .        the time evolution of xuv from m dwarfs similar in mass to gj 1132 is poorly constrained . for main - sequence stars including m dwarfs ,",
    "observations indicate that time - averaged xuv from the stellar corona for young , active stars saturates at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs may stay in this active phase for roughly a gigayear @xcite and then fade to lower xuv flux ratios , although the lower limit for quiescent xuv from old , inactive mid - m dwarfs is just starting to be probed @xcite . here , we take two approaches to bracket the range of uncertainty for xuv - driven atmospheric loss .",
    "the xuv flux models are shown in figure [ fig : stellar_flux ] .",
    "xuv flux model a assumes that xuv emissions are @xmath22 times the evolving stellar luminosity @xcite and declining as a power law after 1 gyr with @xmath23 .",

    "hence a very large amount of hydrogen ( 2% to 14% of the total mass ) could have been lost from gj1132b since its formation .",
    "having demonstrated that even a substantial primordial hydrogen envelope could have been lost from gj 1132 b , we now assess the possibility that the planet has retained an atmosphere of heavier gases .",
    "the first thing we need to calculate is the rate at which hydrogen escape would drag away heavier species .",
    "the flux received by gj 1132 b places it well within the kombayashi - ingersoll limit for the runaway greenhouse ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : lbl_goldblatt_intercomp ] ) a planetary albedo of 0.955 is required for stable surface water on gj1132b , which is implausibly high for a planet with an atmosphere .",
    "enceladus has an albedo of 0.99 @xcite , but it is airless with a surface composition dominated by fresh water ice . ] @xcite .",
    "if it formed with some water it would hence initially have had an -rich upper atmosphere .",
    "given an intense early xuv - driven escape regime , the oxygen in this , along with other heavy elements such as or , would have been dragged along with the escaping hydrogen .",
    "the loss rate of a heavier species in the neutral hydrodynamic escape regime depends on how effectively the hydrogen drags that species with it .",
    "specifically , the number flux @xmath27 of a heavy species 2 [ in molecules / m@xmath5/s ] is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the molar concentrations [ mol / mol ] and molecular masses [ amu ] of species 1 and 2 .",
    "the crossover mass @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 here @xmath35 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath36 is the temperature of the escaping gas , @xmath37 is gravitational acceleration at the escape radius , @xmath38 is the proton mass and @xmath39 is the binary diffusion coefficient for species 1 and 2 . for o atoms dragged by h , @xmath40  m@xmath41  s@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we also define a reference flux @xmath42 for species 1 in the absence of heavy species @xcite .",
    "note that when @xmath43 , @xmath44 in general .",
    "otherwise , @xmath45 , so that the loss rate depends on the relative abundances of species 1 and 2 . in our coupled model ,",
    "we set @xmath46 equal to the diffusion - limited loss rate and @xmath47 equal to zero once the abundance of exceeds that of .",
    "following @xcite , we use the composition - dependent loss rates for h and o , rather than the stoichiometric loss rates of @xcite .",
    "we discuss the possibility of oxygen - dominated escape from gj 1132 b in a later section .",
    "equations ( [ eq : crossmass ] ) and ( [ eq : ref_flux ] ) can be used to define the critical xuv flux required for drag to occur . setting @xmath48 , we can write @xmath49 x_1\\ ] ] with @xmath50 the potential energy of one molecule of species 1 . for gj1132b , given o drag by h with @xmath23 and @xmath51  k , @xmath52  w / m@xmath5 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : stellar_flux ] , this is smaller than the estimated xuv flux received by gj1132b for the first 10  gy of its lifetime in model a , implying that oxygen will continually be dragged along with escaping hydrogen if an -rich atmosphere is present . however , the planet will still oxidize overall as the escape rate of o is less rapid . whether this oxidation could lead to a detectable atmospheric oxygen signal",
    "depends on atmosphere - interior exchange rates , which we address in the section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the net buildup rate of o on the planet in the hydrodynamic drag escape regime can be approximated as @xmath53 where the @xmath54 and @xmath55 terms are the molecular number density and individual scale heights of species 1 and 2 , respectively . for o diffusing through h following photolysis @xcite @xmath56 equation ( [ eq : odiff ] )",
    "can be simply physically interpreted as the diffusion rate of o atoms out of the escaping region back to the lower atmosphere .",
    "the rate at which a planet exchanges volatiles between the atmosphere and interior is a strong function of temperature . in particular , once the surface is hot enough to be in a magma ocean state , the atmosphere and interior will equilibrate on geologically short timescales .",
    "for this reason , climate calculations are necessary to assess the increase in surface temperature due to the atmosphere s greenhouse effect .",
    "to calculate surface temperature , we first calculate the outgoing longwave radiation ( olr ) from a pure atmosphere using a line - by - line radiative transfer calculation .",
    "we integrate the monochromatic equation for upwelling radiative flux per unit wavenumber ( w / m@xmath5/cm@xmath41 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is surface temperature , @xmath60 is the mean path optical depth at a given wavenumber @xmath61 and pressure @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the total optical depth , and @xmath64 is the planck spectral irradiance .",
    "mean path optical depth is defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is surface pressure , @xmath37 is surface gravity and @xmath67 is the mass absorption coefficient ( m@xmath5/kg ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath68 is the mean emission angle cosine , which we take to be a constant 0.5 here .",
    "the layer optical depth weighting approach of @xcite is used to ensure accurate model behaviour in high absorption regions of the spectrum .",
    "line absorption coefficients for are calculated from the 2010 hitemp line list @xcite , with the voigt function used to describe lineshapes and temperature scaling for the line strengths following standard methods @xcite .",
    "the calculation is performed over 30  layers up to a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1  pa .",
    "spectral calculations were performed from 1  cm@xmath41 to 5 times the wien peak wavenumber of the planck function at the given surface temperature .",
    "we used 5000 points in wavenumber ; sensitivity tests indicated that further increases in spectral resolution had an insignificant effect on the integrated olr .    the temperature profile was assumed to be a dry adiabat from the surface to the tropopause , after which a stratospheric temperature equal to the skin temperature for gj1132b given a planetary albedo of 0.75 was assumed ( 344.2  k ) .",
    "ideal gas behaviour was assumed when calculating the dry adiabat , which is a reasonable approximation for the range of temperatures and pressures studied @xcite .",
    "we accounted for the variation in the specific heat capacity of water vapour as a function of temperature using data from @xcite .",
    "continuum opacity due to far - wing absorption of strong lines and other effects was taken into account using the mt - ckd parametrization @xcite .",
    "outside of the mt - ckd temperature range of validity , continuum absorption was simply set to its value at the maximum temperature given .",
    "spectral lines were truncated at 25  cm@xmath41 to avoid double - counting of the continuum absorption . to render the line - by - line calculation more manageable",
    ", we also preprocessed the hitemp-2010 dataset by removing weak lines , which we defined as lines with a reference strength below @xmath69",
    "cm@xmath41 / cm@xmath5 molecule@xmath41 at 1000  k. this approximation means that we slightly underestimate the atmospheric opacity at the highest temperatures and pressures studied .",
    "as the planet s surface is already in a magma ocean state under these conditions , however , this has little effect on atmospheric evolution .    to validate the code",
    ", we first ensured that it reproduced semi - analytic textbook results ( figure  4.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "next , we compared the code output with runaway greenhouse calculations for earth @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbl_goldblatt_intercomp ] shows the results of this intercomparison . as can be seen , our model agrees closely with published results except in a small region around 1200  cm@xmath41 , most likely due to slightly differing assumptions for the continuum ( c. goldblatt , personal communication ) .",
    "given the large uncertainties in other parameters for gj1132b , we decided this agreement was more than sufficient for our purposes .",
    "we calculated the olr over a range of surface temperatures from 400 to 4000  k and a range of surface pressures from 1  pa to 1000  bar . at high surface temperatures ,",
    "the uncertainty in water vapour opacity becomes large due to uncertainty in the scaling of the continuum .",
    "however , at these temperatures the planet s surface is in a magma ocean state that permits rapid exchange of oxygen between the atmosphere and interior .",
    "hence this uncertainty should have little effect on our key conclusions .",
    "we calculate the atmospheric heat flux as a balance of the outgoing longwave radiation ( olr ) and the absorbed shortwave radiation ( asr ) .",
    "the asr is given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the planetary albedo and @xmath73 is the bolometric stellar flux received by the planet , which we derived by interpolating data from @xcite to the mass of gj 1132 .",
    "the planetary albedo of gj 1132 b is currently unconstrained , although observations indicate low albedos for planets orbiting m dwarfs in general .",
    "@xcite did a statistical study of kepler s close - in super - earths and found a median total albedo of @xmath0 0.3 , although values ranged up to 0.92 .",
    "note that the sample of planets studied all had equilibrium temperatures significantly larger than gj 1132 b , and they may be more representative of bare rocky planets than those with dense atmosphere . here",
    "we take the albedo of venus , as a representative planet with a thick , hot atmosphere , as our nominal constant value @xmath74 , but discuss the effect of lower albedos in the results section .",
    "we address the atmosphere - interior rates of exchange by coupling our atmospheric model with a magma ocean model , which includes thermal evolution and the exchange of and o with the atmosphere .",
    "the thermal parameterization combines elements of the work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . as in these papers",
    ", we assume that solidification of the magma ocean proceeds from the bottom up , due to the fact that mantle adiabats are steeper than the solidus and liquidus curves of silicates .",
    "the thermal evolution is governed by two temperatures : the mantle potential temperature , which dictates the degree of melting and convection within the mantle , and the surface temperature , which is governed by heat flux out of the mantle and heat loss from the top of the atmosphere . for most of the duration of the magma ocean phase ,",
    "these temperatures are the same . however , as the solidification front ( the depth at which the mantle adiabat intersects the mantle solidus ) moves towards the surface , a thermal boundary layer can develop at the surface , which insulates the mantle from additional heat loss . following formation of the thermal boundary layer , the model switches to whole mantle solid - state convection as parameterized in @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere is assumed to be composed of , h and o gases .",
    "is the only source of atmospheric opacity and the climate is calculated as discussed above .",
    "the composition and thickness of the atmosphere depends on mass exchange with the magma ocean and loss of volatiles due to both atmospheric escape and crystallization into the solid mantle . following magma ocean solidification , only passive outgassing of and atmospheric loss occur .",
    "we will discuss each of these aspects in more detail below .",
    "the thermal evolution of the magma ocean potential temperature is given by :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the mantle bulk density , @xmath77 is the silicate heat capacity ( @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 is the planetary radius , @xmath80 is the core radius , @xmath81 is the radius of solidification , @xmath82 is the heat of fusion of silicates ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath84 is the mantle heat flux , @xmath85 is the heat generated by radioactive decay .",
    "we begin our calculations at @xmath86 = 4000 k , which is hot enough for the magma ocean to extend from the surface to the core - mantle boundary .",
    "the heat generated by radioactive decay is limited to the long - lived isotopes , , and .",
    "abundances of these elements are assumed to be the same as for the earth s mantle , and the parameterization for @xmath85 is the same as that given by @xcite equation ( 4 ) .",
    "although we expect gj 1132 b to have different abundances of the radioactive elements , the results of the magma ocean model are relatively insensitive to them , given the typically short lifetimes of the magma oceans .",
    "after solidification , the first term on the rhs disappears and the thermal evolution proceeds as for @xcite .",
    "the mantle heat flux is parameterized by the mantle rayleigh number :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the thermal conductivity ( 4.2 w m@xmath41 k@xmath41 ) , the critical rayleigh number ( @xmath89 ) and the exponent @xmath90 ( 0.33 ) are determined from numerical mantle convection simulations , @xmath17 is the thermal expansion coefficient ( @xmath91 k@xmath41 ) , @xmath92 is the thermal conductivity ( @xmath93 m@xmath19 s@xmath41 ) , and @xmath94 is the kinematic viscosity ( m s@xmath95 ) .",
    "the dynamic viscosity @xmath96 for a silicate liquid is very small , of order 0.01 pa s. we therefore assume that the liquid portion of the magma ocean is instantaneously well - mixed .",
    "we only consider convection within the magma ocean , not the solid mantle , until solidification of the magma ocean has occurred . as",
    "partial crystallization proceeds , the viscosity of the magma ocean increases dramatically .",
    "the viscosity depends on the melt fraction , which we do not use here to avoid confusion with the energy - limited escape flux , see eqn ( [ eq : elim2 ] ) ] @xmath97 , which is given by @xmath98 .",
    "we use the same viscosity parameterizations as @xcite . below a critical melt fraction ( @xmath99 0.4 ) , the viscosity becomes solid - like , where our solid viscosity is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , @xmath102 kj mole@xmath41 and @xmath103 is the ideal gas constant .",
    "the radius of solidification is given by the intersection of the mantle adiabat with the mantle solidus .",
    "we derive an equation for @xmath104 by approximating the adiabat as the first taylor expansion , and the solidus as a straight line in two sections , from 0 - 100 km , and from 100 km to the core - mantle boundary .",

    "the liquidus is assumed to be larger than the solidus by 600 k. the linear parameterization for the solidus leads to a simple and straightforward analytic expression for the radius of solidification , which yields our second differential equation :    @xmath108 = a g \\rho_m ( r_p - r_s ) + b\\\\ \\frac{dr_s}{dt } = \\frac{c_p(b \\alpha - a \\rho_m c_p)}{g(a \\rho_m c_p - \\alpha t_p)^2 } \\frac{dt_p}{dt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the surface temperature of the planet is calculated from the heat loss equation for the surface environment , where we make the simplification that the atmosphere and thermal boundary layer are governed by a single average temperature ( @xmath59 ) :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the heat flux from the atmosphere , calculated from olr - asr ( see sec .",

    "the potential temperature and surface temperature are nearly identical until the `` mush '' stage is reached and the boundary layer begins to grow . when the surface temperature reaches the solidus temperature ( 1420 k ) , the magma ocean phase has concluded . when applied to an earth - like planet",
    ", our thermal model reproduces the cooling times and heat fluxes found in @xcite and @xcite very well .",
    "we deviate at later stages due to the fact that we do not include condensible atmospheric water vapor , which will not be present on gj 1132b .",
    "however , the comparison gives us confidence that our thermal model produces reasonable results .",
    "water is very soluble in silicate melts , so the pressure at the surface of the planet during the magma ocean stage is set by its solubility in the magma ocean .",

    "the mass of water in the magma ocean + atmosphere system ( @xmath117 ) and the mass of water in the solid mantle at a given time are determined with the differential equations : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the xuv - driven atmospheric mass loss rate of h ( in kg m@xmath95 s@xmath41 ) , discussed in section [ sec : primordial ] .",

    "<S> gj 1132 b is a nearby earth - sized exoplanet transiting an m dwarf , and is amongst the most highly characterizable small exoplanets currently known . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the interaction of a magma ocean with a water - rich atmosphere on gj 1132b and determine that it must have begun with more than 5 wt% initial water in order to still retain a water - based atmosphere . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the magma ocean absorbs at most @xmath0 10% of the produced , whereas more than 90% is lost to space through hydrodynamic drag . </S>",
    "<S> the most common outcome for gj 1132 b from our simulations is a tenuous atmosphere dominated by , although for very large initial water abundances atmospheres with several thousands of bars of are possible . </S>",
    "<S> a substantial steam envelope would indicate either the existence of an earlier envelope or low xuv flux over the system s lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> a steam atmosphere would also imply the continued existence of a magma ocean on gj 1132 b. further modeling is needed to study the evolution of or -rich atmospheres on gj 1132 b. </S>"
