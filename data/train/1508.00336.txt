    "four - nucleon reactions above breakup threshold pose a highly challenging theoretical and computational problem . in this regime rigorous and realistic results",
    "have been obtained so far by only two methodologies .",
    "these are the complex - energy method in the framework of momentum - space integral equations @xcite and the complex scaling method in the framework of coordinate - space differential equations @xcite .    in this work",
    "we continue our theoretical investigation of the four - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) scattering above breakup threshold .",
    "previous studies @xcite were mostly devoted to @xmath0 reactions initiated by nucleon - trinucleon ( @xmath1 ) collisions , i.e. , neutron ( @xmath2 ) or proton ( @xmath3 ) beams impinging on @xmath4 or @xmath5 targets . while @xmath6 and @xmath7 elastic scattering are dominated by states with total @xmath0 isospin @xmath8 , the coupled @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions involve both @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "overall a good reproduction of the experimental data was achieved when using realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath12 ) potentials .",
    "the most remarkable discrepancies above breakup threshold are the nucleon analyzing power and polarization , especially for the @xmath13 charge exchange reaction , and the minimum of the differential cross section in elastic @xmath7 and @xmath9 scattering above 25 mev nucleon energy .",
    "one may raise the question whether these disagreements are dominated by @xmath8 states , or if @xmath11 components have similar shortcomings as well .",
    "the study of deuteron - deuteron ( @xmath14 ) elastic scattering , the only @xmath0 process dominated by @xmath11 states , may shed some light on this issue .",
    "therefore in the present work we concentrate on @xmath14 elastic scattering above breakup threshold . in ref .",
    "@xcite we already calculated @xmath14 reactions around @xmath15 mev deuteron beam energy and found quite a good agreement with data , but also some inconsistencies between different data sets , thereby calling for a more extensive study over a wider energy range . here",
    "we present results at @xmath16 ranging from 4.75 mev , just slightly above the three - cluster threshold of 4.45 mev , to 25.3 mev .",
    "restricting the model space to @xmath0 states with @xmath11 precludes to obtain simultaneously reliable amplitudes for @xmath17 and @xmath18 transfer reactions , but has an important practical advantage , namely , allows for the reduction of the number of basis states needed to get convergence for the @xmath14 elastic observables and thereby speeds up the calculations .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the theoretical framework and the reliability of using @xmath11 states alone to calculate @xmath14 elastic scattering .",
    "differential cross section and analyzing power results are shown in sec .",
    "iii and a summary is presented in sec .",
    "the four - particle collision process is described by exact alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite for the transition operators @xmath19 whose components are labeled according to the chains of partitions .",
    "given that neutrons and protons in the isospin formalism are treated as identical particles , there are only two chains of partitions that can be distinguished by the two - cluster partitions , one ( @xmath20 ) being of the @xmath21 type , i.e. , ( 12,3)4 , and another ( @xmath22 ) being of the @xmath23 type , i.e. , ( 12)(34 ) . for the nucleon - trinucleon scattering in previous works we solved the symmetrized ags equations for @xmath24 but the reactions initiated by two deuterons require transition operators @xmath25 .",
    "in both cases the ags equations share the same kernel but differ in the driving term .",
    "thus , in the present work we solve the integral equations    [ eq : u ] @xmath26    here @xmath27 is the two - nucleon transition matrix , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the transition operators for the 1 + 3 and 2 + 2 subsystems , @xmath30 is the permutation operator of particles 3 and 4 , and @xmath31 is the free four - particle resolvent at the available energy @xmath32 , whereas @xmath33 is the free hamiltonian .",
    "although the physical scattering process corresponds to @xmath34 , the complex energy method uses finite @xmath35 value when solving the ags equations numerically .",
    "the physical scattering amplitudes are then obtained by extrapolating finite @xmath35 results to the @xmath34 limit .",
    "the extrapolation procedure as well as the special method for integrals with quasi - singularities encountered when solving eqs .",
    "are described in detail in our previous works @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath14 channel state is a pure total isospin @xmath11 state .",
    "however , due to the charge dependence of the @xmath12 interaction the scattering equations couple the states with different @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of @xmath37 states on the @xmath14 elastic scattering is of second order in the charge - dependent terms of the @xmath12 interaction that are dominated by the @xmath38 coulomb force ; a smaller contribution from the hadronic part is present as well . therefore at not too low energies one may expect these effects to be small .",
    "this conjecture is well supported by our test calculations for @xmath14 elastic scattering where we find a tiny effect of the @xmath8 states , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] for the differential cross section @xmath39 and tensor analyzing power @xmath40 , both as functions of the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "scattering angle @xmath41 .",
    "the results in the next section therefore are obtained by solving eqs .   with @xmath11 states alone .",
    "this reduces the number of basis states by more than a factor of 2 thereby speeding up the practical calculations significantly . with @xmath11",

    "initial and final deuteron - deuteron states with relative orbital angular momentum @xmath51 are sufficient for the calculation of observables except at the 25.3 mev beam energy where we take into account also the states up to @xmath52 yielding a small but visible contribution .",
    "the scattering of two deuterons is both challenging from the computational point of view and interesting vis - a - vis nucleon - trinucleon scattering .",

    "[ fig : s ] we show results for the @xmath14 elastic differential cross section in the @xmath16 range between 5.46 and 14.2 mev . in this regime @xmath39",
    "shows quite a simple angular dependence , having forward and backward peaks where @xmath39 becomes infinite due to the coulomb force and a single local minimum at @xmath57 .",
    "the calculations describe the data @xcite well up to @xmath59 mev and show little sensitivity to the @xmath12 force model as one may naively expect given the large size of both projectile and target nuclei . the largest observed difference between the four employed force models amounts about 6% at @xmath58 mev around @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for @xmath16 above 12.3 mev small discrepancies between data and calculations emerge , mostly around @xmath57 .",
    "however , one probably should question the quality of the data @xcite near @xmath57 where , in contrast to all other sets , a local maximum is present , as well as the quality of the data @xcite that lacks symmetry with respect to @xmath57 and seems to be inconsistent with a smooth energy - dependence seen in theoretical predictions and other data sets .",
    "our calculations overpredict the 14.2 mev data @xcite by up to 9% but underpredict the 13.8 mev data @xcite around the minimum by the same amount .",
    "unfortunately , the available experimental data are very scarce above @xmath62 mev . to the best of our knowledge , up to @xmath63 mev which is the reach of the present calculations there is only one reliable data set at @xmath56 mev @xcite . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : s25 ] , at this higher energy the differential cross section finally develops a more complicated angular dependence with a local maximum at @xmath57 and two local minima around @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the calculations reproduce well the shape of the data but slightly underpredict its magnitude by about 6% at forward angles and around @xmath57 .",
    "although the outlook is somehow contradictory , it looks like the calculations slightly underpredict the experimental @xmath39 data above @xmath66 mev .",
    "in contrast to lower energies where the minimum region is insensitive to the @xmath12 potential , at @xmath56 mev at @xmath57 the spread of predictions is about 3% but shows no correlation with @xmath42 binding energy .    in fig .",

    "the overall agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data is good . due to the large spatial size of the deuteron ,",
    "all these spin observables are very small in their magnitude , in a sharp contrast with reactions involving initial and/or final nucleon - trinucleon states . unlike the differential cross section , the analyzing powers exhibit not only a more complex behavior as functions of energy and scattering angle , but also a greater sensitivity to the used @xmath12 force model , especially for @xmath40 and around the extrema of @xmath67 and @xmath69 .",
    "while tensor analyzing powers monotonically increase in their magnitude with moderate changes in the shape as the energy increases , the vector analyzing power @xmath67 exhibits a change of sign after nearly vanishing at @xmath72 mev .",
    "the error bars exceed the force model dependence for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "predictions based on n3lo and cd bonn potentials slightly deviate from the data for @xmath40 above 10 mev whereas inoy04 and cd bonn + @xmath55 reproduce the data well .",
    "however , inoy04 slightly underestimates the magnitude of @xmath69 whereas cd bonn + @xmath55 provides the best description of this observable .",
    "in general , the dependence of the observables on the details of the interaction is more complicated than just a simple scaling with the trinucleon binding energy or deuteron @xmath73-state probability .",
    "the @xmath55-isobar excitation appears to be more important than in the nucleon - trinucleon scattering .",

    "we have only included total isospin @xmath11 states alone , given that @xmath8 states have an extremely small contribution to @xmath14 elastic scattering , as demonstrated in sec .",
    "overall , no striking disagreement with the data is observed .",
    "the calculated observables follow the energy trend of the experimental data up to @xmath74 mev , which is the maximum energy we have calculated at this time .",
    "we find that there is a slight underprediction of the differential cross section minimum beyond 13.2 mev ; however , this is not in a full analogy with the @xmath7 and @xmath9 elastic scattering since the discrepancy in @xmath14 neither increases with the beam energy from 13.8 to 25.3 mev nor scales with @xmath42 binding energy .",
    "we also observe no increase in sensitivity for spin observables compared to what is found in @xmath1 scattering .",
