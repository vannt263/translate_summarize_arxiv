    "the crab nebula is one of the best studied pwn at almost all observable wavelengths including its central pulsar , called the crab pulsar .",

    "recent observations have found many pwne which have a variety of characteristics in terms of age , expansion velocity , morphology , radiation spectrum and others .",
    "some of these characteristics may be understood by the spectral evolution of pwne .",
    "for example , several old pwne which are faint in x - rays have been detected in tev @xmath0-rays and @xcite discussed the possibility that some of the tev @xmath0-ray sources without an x - ray counterpart may be old pwne . when we study the broadband spectrum of old pwne , we need to take into account the evolution of the injected energy from the pulsar , such as the magnetic field and the relativistic particles . for old pwne , most of the energy inside the pwne is the energy which was injected when they were young because the spin - down power of the pulsar decreases fast with time .",

    "thirdly , for @xmath136 , the change of the particle distribution is small .",
    "the difference between all the lines for several epochs is less than a factor of two .",
    "this leads to an important conclusion that the radio flux decrease is mainly due to the decrease of the magnetic field , so that the observations of the radio flux decrease support our model of the magnetic field evolution .",

    "using the same parameters as in figure [ f1 ] , we find @xmath203 and @xmath204 .    in @xcite , they suggested that some of the tev @xmath0-ray sources without an x - ray counterpart can be old pwne because the x - ray emitting particles are cooled more rapidly than the tev @xmath0-ray emitting particles by the synchrotron cooling . in our model ,",
    "old pwne can also be the @xmath0-ray sources with no or weak x - ray counterpart because the ic / cmb is almost time independent .",
    "however the same result comes from the different reason .",
    "because the number of the high energy particles is even increasing in our model as seen in figure [ f3 ] , this result comes from the rapid decrease of the magnetic field . pwne which are old and has a small fraction parameter @xmath19 can be recognized as the @xmath0-ray source without an x - ray counterpart .",
    "note that @xmath202 slowly decreases with time , when we properly consider the cooling effects @xmath205 , as seen in figure [ f2 ] at 3kyr and 10kyr .",
    "the fitted parameters @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath26 relate to the broken power - law injection in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the above parameters include the information about the acceleration at the termination shock and the physics of the pulsar wind and the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we discuss about them in the framework of our model .    for the low and high energy power - law indices at injection @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we determine these values to reproduce the observed radio and x - ray photon indices , @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "radio photon index @xmath208 is related to @xmath122 , but x - ray photon index @xmath209 is not simply related to @xmath123 because of the synchrotron cooling . because it is difficult to make a large spectral break @xmath210 from the single power - law injection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt the broken power - law injection .    for the maximum energy @xmath115",
    ", we determine this value to reproduce the observed spectral break at @xmath211 .",
    "the maximum energy @xmath28 is conventionally given by comparing the acceleration time with the cooling time or the size of the acceleration site with the lamor radius .",
    "both conditions give @xmath212 using the magnetic field strength @xmath213 and the size of the acceleration site @xmath214 .",
    "the fitted value is near the limit of theoretical expectation .    for the break energy @xmath116",
    ", we determine this value to reproduce the observed spectral break around optical wavelengths .",
    "although the kc model related @xmath27 to the bulk lorentz factor of the pulsar wind immediately upstream the termination shock , our model does not allow this connection as discussed below .",
    "finally , for the minimum energy @xmath117 , we determine this value to reproduce the flux of the observed minimum frequency at radio wavelengths . because @xmath215 , the particles around @xmath26 determine the injection of the particle number as @xmath216 .",
    "the particle number conservation outside the pulsar light cylinder leads to the particle number flux into the pwn is much larger than the goldreich - julian number flux @xmath217 , which is the particle number flux from the pulsar polar cap . in our model , the pair production multiplicity at an age of a thousand year @xmath218 from equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) . theoretically , the multiplicity is estimated as @xmath219 .",
    "our value @xmath220 is somewhat large .",
    "the mean energy of the injected particles @xmath221 is significantly smaller than @xmath222 .",
    "@xcite did not use the broken power - law injection .",
    "they divided the particles inside the pwn into the low energy particles as the relic electrons and the high energy particles as the wind electrons .",
    "this assumption can reduce the multiplicity , but the origin of the relic electrons becomes another problem .",
    "it is difficult to discuss anything more about this problem from our spectral evolution model .",
    "one thing what we should note is that the relation between the radio flux decrease and the magnetic field evolution is always kept , i.e. , the relation is independent of how and when the radio emitting particles are injected .",
    "this is because the low energy particles whose power - law index is @xmath122 do exist from the observation and their distribution hardly changes by the cooling effect , as discussed in section [ crab_evolution ] .",
    "the evolutions of the magnetic field and the particle distribution determine the spectral evolution of a pwn .",
    "the evolution of the particle distribution is affected by the assumptions of the magnetic field evolution model , uniformity of the pwn , particle injection spectrum , and expansion evolution of the pwn .",
    "we discuss about the effects of these assumptions which are made in our model . finally , we summarize the conclusions of this paper .",
    "our model of the magnetic field evolution is somewhat ad hoc . as discussed in section [ mag_evol ] , however , the time dependence of the magnetic field strength @xmath223 for @xmath45 seems to be in a range of @xmath224 from other theoretical considerations and we adopt @xmath225 .",
    "moreover , because our result of the radio flux decrease of the crab nebula is almost consistent with the observation , our model of the magnetic field evolution can be near the truth .    for the assumption of the uniform pwn ,",
    "many non - uniform structures have been observed , such as the filamentary structures and the spatial variations of photon indices .",
    "however , for the calculation of the total spectrum of the pwn , the energetics of the pwn is important in the lowest order .",
    "we consider that the assumption of the uniform pwn is reasonable for the calculation of the total spectral evolution of the pwn .    for the injection spectrum of the particle distribution",
    ", the acceleration of the particles is an unsolved problem and we adopt the broken power - law injection .",
    "it should be noted that one of the important conclusions in our study that old pwne can be observed as @xmath0-ray sources with no or weak x - ray counterpart is not affected by the broken power - law assumption .",
    "this is because low energy particles do not contribute to x - ray and high energy @xmath0-ray emissions .",
    "the use of the time independent parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be improved as time dependent parameters , because the physical condition of pulsar wind termination shock may be change with the decrease of the spin - down power of the pulsar . considering the time dependence of @xmath226 , in @xcite",
    ", they use the condition @xmath227 with time dependent magnetic field , where @xmath228 is the electrons larmor radius and @xmath229 is the radius of the termination shock . as discussed in section [ other ] , our model satisfy this condition . both @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are important parameters because these may include the information about the pulsar magnetosphere and the pulsar wind . however , the time dependences of them are uncertain . for simplicity , we used all of them as the time independent parameters in the present paper .",
    "constant velocity expansion is a good assumption for young pwne , although the expansion of the pwn should be calculated by taking account for the environment of the pwn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our model ,",
    "the magnetic field evolution explicitly depends on the expansion velocity @xmath80 ( see equation ( [ eq8 ] ) ) . to understand a little more about the effects of the expansion evolution , we study how the crab nebula would be observed in the context of the constant velocity expansion .",
    "the crab nebula is one of the sources without observable snr shell",
    ". it may be because the surrounding interstellar medium is less dense than other pwne with observable snr shell .",
    "if the crab nebula were in the different surroundings , the expansion velocity would also be affected .",
    "that is , if it were in a less or more dense surroundings , the expansion velocity would be more rapid or slower .",
    "an example of a twice rapid expansion is shown in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "all the parameters except the expansion velocity are the same as in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "an example of a half velocity expansion is shown in figure [ f7 ] and all parameters except for the expansion velocity are the same as in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "note that both of them are hypothetical pwne , not the crab nebula itself .",
    "for the spectrum of the rapid expansion case , the absolute value of the flux becomes smaller and the flux ratio of the inverse compton scattering to the synchrotron radiation is larger than the real crab nebula shown in figure [ f1 ] and for the spectrum of the slow expansion case vice versa .",
    "comparing the particle distribution in figure [ f6 ] with that in figure [ f7 ] , the low energy particles take the same distribution , but the high energy particle distribution in figure [ f7 ] is steeper than that in figure [ f6 ] . these spectral behaviors against the expansion velocity can be understood from equations ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) . in our model ,",
    "the magnetic field becomes smaller when the expansion velocity becomes larger .",
    "this leads to the difference in the absolute flux and the synchrotron cooling which changes the high energy particle distribution . on the other hand , because the adiabatic cooling does not depend on the absolute value of the expansion velocity , the low energy particle distribution does not change .",
    "lastly , in @xcite , they included the infrared photons and the starlight for the target photon fields of the inverse compton scattering .",
    "although these soft photons can significantly contribute to the @xmath0-ray flux of other pwne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is not the case of the crab nebula .",
    "because the crab nebula is located far away from the galactic center ( @xmath230 ) and galactic plane ( @xmath231 ) , the energy density of these soft photon fields is less than the solar neighborhood ( @xmath232 from the galactic center ) . even if we assume that the energy density of the infrared photons and the starlight is the same as the solar neighborhood , the inverse compton scattering off these photon fields contributes less than 30 % of the current total @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "note that it also does not much affect the @xmath0-ray spectrum , when the ssc flux decreases if the energy density of these soft photon fields is less than the half that in the solar neighborhood since inverse compton scattering off the cmb dominates there .      in this paper , we built a model of the spectral evolution of pwne and applied to the crab nebula as a calibrator of our model .",
    "we solved the equation for the particle distribution function considering adiabatic and radiative losses with a simple model of magnetic field evolution .",
    "the flux decrease of the @xmath0-rays is more moderate than radio to x - rays , because the magnetic field decreases rapidly , which implies that old pwne can be observed as @xmath0-ray sources with no or weak x - ray counterpart .",
    "although @xcite obtained the same result but for a different reason that the x - ray emitting particles are cooled more rapidly than tev @xmath0-ray emitting particles .",
    "the current observed spectrum of the crab nebula is reconstructed when the fraction parameter has a small value @xmath114 .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of the magnetization parameter @xmath120 obtained by @xcite .",
    "they obtained @xmath120 from the viewpoint of the current dynamical structure of the crab nebula , while we determine @xmath121 from the viewpoint of the spectral evolution .",
    "the smaller value of the current magnetic field @xmath233 is needed to reconstruct the observed spectrum of the crab nebula .",
    "this is consistent with that of @xcite for the spatially averaged magnetic field strength @xmath213 from their relativistic mhd simulation , but smaller than @xmath234 in most of other papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our model can predict the spectral evolution of the crab nebula , and the observed flux decrease of the crab nebula at radio wavelengths can be explained by our model . this conclusion does not depend on the assumption of the broken power - law injection , and",
    "gives the validity of the our magnetic field evolution model .",
    "the observed flux decrease of the crab nebula in optical wavelengths is somewhat larger than our model , but the trend that the decreasing rate increases with frequency matches observations .",
    "the minimum energy @xmath26 is related to the pair production multiplicity in the pulsar magnetosphere , since low energy particles are assumed to be injected in the same way as high energy particles in our model .",
    "our result of the minimum energy @xmath117 and the low energy power - law index @xmath118 means that the multiplicity @xmath220 is necessarily larger than other models which adopt a separate origin of low energy particles .",
