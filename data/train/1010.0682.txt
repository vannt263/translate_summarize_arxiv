    "the ` strange metal ' is a non - zero temperature phase of electrons in solids which appears to be a common to most ` correlated electron ' compounds .",
    "these are compounds with transition - metal or rare - earth elements with a crystal structure which often promotes electronic transport primarily within a single two - dimensional layer of atoms .",
    "the strange metal is typically found at temperatures ( @xmath3 ) above low temperature phases which display antiferromagnetism and superconductivity . it is defined as ` strange ' because the temperature and frequency dependence of many observables deviate strongly from those expected from conventional fermi liquid theory : most famously , the resistance increases linearly with @xmath3 , over a wide range of @xmath3 values . while the cuprate high temperature superconductors are the most prominent compounds displaying strange metal behavior @xcite , similar regimes are also found in ruthenium oxides @xcite , iron pnictides @xcite , organic metals @xcite , and heavy - fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence was originally discovered as a tool for describing strongly - coupled gauge theories @xcite . in @xmath4 spacetime dimensions , yang mills gauge theory with @xmath5 supersymmetry ( abbreviated as sym4 ) is characterized by a single dimensionless coupling constant which remains invariant under the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "consequently , the theory is conformally invariant for all values of the coupling , and can be viewed as the simplest interacting conformal field theory in @xmath4 spacetime dimensions : a cft4 . with a su(@xmath6 )",
    "gauge group , this theory was argued to be equivalent to a string theory on an ads@xmath7 background , where ads is anti - de sitter , a symmetric space with constant negative curvature .",
    "more usefully , in the @xmath8 limit for the low energy physics , the string theory can be approximated simply by classical einstein gravity on ads@xmath9 .",
    "thus , remarkably , correlations of gauge theories in @xmath4 can be related to properties of the einstein gravity in a negatively curved space in @xmath10 .",
    "the latter space has an emergent dimension , which can be interpreted as a rg energy scale .",
    "cfts also arise in condensed matter physics in many different contexts . in section  [ sec : qafm ] , we will briefly review the cft3s arising near the quantum critical points of certain quantum antiferromagnets in @xmath0 spatial dimensions .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that such cft3s could also be usefully analyzed via the ads / cft correspondence . in @xmath11 , a supersymmetric analog of the cft3s in section  [ sec : qafm ]",
    "is yang - mills theory with @xmath12 supersymmetry and a su(@xmath6 ) gauge group ( sym3 ) , and this maps in the @xmath8 limit to gravity on ads@xmath13 . unlike the @xmath4 case , the coupling constant of sym3 flows generically to a strong - coupling fixed point , and so there is no free coupling and the low energy physics is conformal .",
    "thus it is always ` quantum critical ' , and it is the first solvable strongly - interacting quantum critical theory in @xmath11 .",
    "the condensed matter cft3s of section  [ sec : qafm ] also have strongly interacting quantum critical points , many of whose properties have resisted accurate solution by other available methods .",
    "even though they are not realized as the large @xmath6 limit of a non - abelian gauge theory , it was argued @xcite that they could be modeled via the ads / cft correspondence . in this context , it should be kept in mind that the operator content of the strongly - coupled fixed point of sym3 is far removed from the non - abelian gauge fields in terms of which it was written down at high energy scales ; thus its quantum critical physics is no more the physics of non - abelian gauge fields than that of the models of section  [ sec : qafm ] .",
    "indeed , it is not unreasonable to view sym3 at small @xmath6 as a supersymmetric generalization of the famous classical @xmath11 ising model at its critical point .",
    "such applications of the ads / cft correspondence to cfts in condensed matter have been reviewed by the author in other articles @xcite , and so will not be explored here . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have argued that the ads / cft results can yield useful information for the frequency and temperature dependence of transport co - efficients which have been studied in experiments in a variety of condensed matter systems .",
    "the cfts discussed so far , and those in section  [ sec : qafm ] , are states of quantum matter which are effectively at _",
    "zero density_. their low energy spectrum is relativistic and particle - hole symmetric , similar to that found in _",
    "e.g. _ pure , undoped graphene . to access states analogous to the strange metal",
    ", we have to study quantum matter at non - zero density .",
    "we do this by turning on a chemical potential , @xmath14 , which couples to a globally conserved charge of the cft ; we choose @xmath15 to correspond to the zero density state .",
    "as long as @xmath16 , the ads / cft correspondence can be extended straightforwardly , and many new results for quantum - critical transport in condensed matter have been obtained by this method @xcite .",
    "these have also been reviewed elsewhere @xcite , and will not be discussed further here .",
    "we turn , finally , to states of non - zero density quantum matter at low temperature , which have @xmath17 . here , even for the supersymmetric cfts at large @xmath6 , the application of the ads / cft correspondence is not immediate . the cft has scalar fields with exactly flat directions in their potential , and when placed at a non - zero @xmath14 at @xmath18 these flat directions appear to lead to an instability of the theory .",
    "nevertheless , one can presume that the strongly coupled cft at non - zero @xmath14 continues to have a gravitational description in the ads language . in the absence of a precise derivation of the theory on ads ,",
    "the spirit of effective field theory can be used to postulate a phenomenological action on ads , which then predicts interesting new physics in the doped - cft at low @xmath3 .",
    "just such a strategy has been used in a large number of recent studies .",
    "two broad classes of states have been obtained by this method .",
    "states in one class display the condensation of a charged @xcite or a neutral @xcite scalar field ( or both @xcite ) ; we will not study this class here .",
    "states in the second class have no broken symmetries and display evidence of metallic behavior and fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fermi surface quasiparticles have non - fermi liquid damping , and the resistance can have a linear dependence on @xmath3 for a particular value of an effective parameter _",
    "i.e. _ the ads theory at non - zero @xmath14 leads to a holographic description of the strange metal .    however , many key properties of the holographic strange metal so obtained are quite mysterious from a condensed - matter perspective . for a cft@xmath19 ,",
    "the ads@xmath20 theory at non - zero @xmath14 factorizes @xcite at low energies to a ads@xmath21 geometry , and this factorization is a key determinant in the unusual properties of the fermi surface .",
    "one immediate consequence is that the singular features in the quasiparticle energy depend primarily on the frequency @xmath22 , and this quantum criticality is described by the ads@xmath1 geometry alone : thus crucial information on the spatial dependence of the strange metal quantum fluctuations appears to be missing .",
    "related to this is the troubling presence of a non - zero entropy density which survives the @xmath23 limit , thus apparently violating the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "finally , the underlying field content leading to this holographic metal phase is not clear .",
    "this paper will review and give additional perspective on a recent proposal @xcite connecting kondo lattice models to the holographic strange metal .",
    "we will do this here by adding matter degrees of freedom to the zero density cft ` one - at - a - time ' . as noted above",
    ", we begin in section  [ sec : qafm ] by describing how cfts arise in two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets . in section",
    "[ sec : qimp ] will add a single spin degree of freedom to the cft : models of this type can be reliably addressed both by traditional condensed matter methods , and in supersymmetric cases by the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we will find a close correspondence in the physical properties in the two cases , including an emergence of ads@xmath1 in the gravitational description .",
    "thus in the single impurity context , a satisfactory physical interpretation of the ads@xmath1 geometry will be obtained .",
    "then we will turn to kondo lattice models and their holographic interpretation in section  [ sec : lattice ] . in the limit of large dimension , or long - range exchange interactions ,",
    "such models can be solved by a mapping to a quantum impurity model coupled to a self - consistent environment .",
    "the mean - field solution describes a ` fractionalized fermi liquid ' ( ffl or fl * ) , with a fermi surface of conduction electrons coupled to a critical spin liquid .",
    "we will argue that such a solution has a close correspondence to the holographic theory with the ads@xmath21 geometry .",
    "this description of the holographic theory leads to simple interpretations of its physical properties . for the kondo lattice ,",
    "the mean - field theory of the critical spin liquid does not have collective gauge excitations which are generically expected to be present in realistic spin liquid with finite - range interactions .",
    "the holographic theory reaches a similar mean - field but without infinite range interactions : thus it is likely to be amenable to systematic improvements .",
    "we hope such improvements will eventually lead to a description of realistic spin liquids and fl * states .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the connection between lattice quantum antiferromagnets in @xmath0 and cft3s , also reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the lattice antiferromagnets are described by the heisenberg exchange hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are @xmath28 spin operators on the sites , @xmath29 , of a regular lattice : thus they obey the commutation relations @xmath30 = i \\epsilon_{abc } \\delta_{ij } \\hat{s}^c_i \\label{commute}\\ ] ] and @xmath31 for each @xmath29 .",
    "different phases , quantum phase transitions and low energy field theories are obtained depending upon whether there are an even or an odd number of @xmath28 spins per unit cell of the lattice .",
    "let us consider first the simpler case of an even number of @xmath28 spins per unit cell .",
    "the canonical model is the dimer antiferromagnet , illustrated in fig .",

    "@xmath35 is a tuning parameter which induces a quantum phase transition in the ground state of this model . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the model has full square lattice symmetry , and this case is known to have a nel ground state which breaks spin rotation symmetry .",
    "this state has a checkerboard polarization of the spins , just as found in the classical ground state , and as illustrated on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssdimer ] .",
    "it can be characterized by a vector order parameter @xmath37 which measures the staggered spin polarization @xmath38 where @xmath39 on the two sublattices of the square lattice . in the nel state we have @xmath40 , and we expect that the low energy excitations can be described by long wavelength fluctuations of a field @xmath41 over space , @xmath42 , and imaginary time @xmath43 . on the other hand , for @xmath44",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : ssdimer ] that the ground state preserves all symmetries of the hamiltonian : it has total spin @xmath45 and can be considered to be a product of nearest neighbor singlet valence bonds on the @xmath34 links .",
    "the simplicity of this large @xmath46 ground state relies crucially on the ` dimerized ' structure of the hamiltonian ; the fact that there are an even number of @xmath28 spins per unit cell .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath47 and @xmath44 states are qualitatively distinct , and so there must be a quantum phase transition at a critical @xmath48 .",
    "we can deduce the quantum field theory for this phase transition by using conventional landau - ginzburg arguments : we use the order parameter @xmath37 , and write down the simplest continuum action consistent with the symmetries of the hamiltonian ; this leads to the partition function @xmath49 + \\frac{u}{4 } \\left [ ( \\varphi^a)^2 \\right]^2 \\label{zphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transition is now tuned by varying @xmath50 .",
    "notice that this model is identical to the landau - ginzburg theory for the thermal phase transition in a @xmath51 dimensional ferromagnet , because time appears as just another dimension . from this",
    "we conclude that the quantum phase transition is described by the famous wilson - fisher fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ zphi ] ) .",
    "this was originally discovered by an analysis of the theory in @xmath52 spacetime dimensions , using @xmath53 as an expansion parameter . since then",
    ", extensive numerical and analytical studies have shown that the fixed point is present also in @xmath11 , where it describes a non - trivial cft3 .",
    "for the dimer antiferromagnet , very convincing evidence that the quantum criticality is described by the wilson - fisher cft3 is presented in @xcite .    in experiments ,",
    "the best studied realization of the dimer antiferromagnet is tlcucl@xmath54 . in this crystal ,",
    "the dimers are coupled in all three spatial dimensions , and the transition from the dimerized state to the nel state can be induced by application of pressure .",
    "neutron scattering experiments by ruegg and collaborators @xcite have clearly observed the transformation in the excitation spectrum across the transition , and these observations are in good quantitative agreement with theory@xcite .      for this case",

    "the ground state has nel order , as we discussed in section  [ sec : even ] .",
    "a variety of routes have been investigated @xcite to continuously destroy the nel order , and we generically represent them as tuning a coupling @xmath46 in fig .",

    "the vbs state is superficially similar to the dimer singlet state in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssdimer ] : the spins primarily form valence bonds with near - neighbor sites . however , because of the square lattice symmetry of the hamiltonian , a columnar arrangement of the valence bonds as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssdimer ] , breaks the square lattice rotation symmetry ; there are 4 equivalent columnar states , with the valence bond columns running along different directions .",
    "more generally , a vbs state is a spin singlet state , with a non - zero degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken lattice symmetry .",
    "a vbs state has been observed in the organic antiferromagnet etme@xmath54p[pd(dmit)@xmath1]@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a direct transition at @xmath48 between the nel and vbs states involves two distinct broken symmetries : spin rotation symmetry , which is broken only in the nel state for @xmath57 , and a lattice rotation symmetry , which is broken only in the vbs state for @xmath58 . the rules of landau - ginzburg - wilson theory imply that there can be no generic second - order transition between such states .",
    "it has been argued that a second - order nel - vbs transition can indeed occur @xcite , but the critical theory is not expressed directly in terms of either order parameter .",
    "it involves a fractionalized bosonic spinor @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , and an emergent gauge field @xmath61 .",

    "we can make a spacetime - dependent change in the phase of the @xmath59 by the field @xmath65 @xmath66 and leave @xmath37 unchanged .",

    "non - perturbative effects @xcite associated with the monopoles in @xmath61 ( not discussed here ) , show that this spin liquid is ultimately unstable to the appearance of vbs order .",
    "an interesting question now is whether the transition between the nel and vbs states as described by ( [ zz ] ) is a cft3 .",

    "[ fig : qimp ] belongs to a wide class of ` kondo ' problems .",

    "there are only two fixed points of the rg , @xmath75 and @xmath76 : at the unstable @xmath75 fixed point , the impurity decouples from the bulk cft , while at the stable @xmath76 fixed point there are only innocuous potential scattering perturbation @xcite .",

    "it is also possible to set up a large @xmath123 limit which has the character of a matrix - large @xmath123 @xcite , but that is not easily solvable and will not be considered here .",
    "we begin with the theory in eq .",
    "( [ zphichi ] ) , and assume that the bulk field @xmath37 has gaussian correlations .",
    "this neglects bulk interactions which are ultimately necessary for an accurate description of the critical properties ; however , this omission will not be crucial for the calculation discussed below .",
    "ultimately , the justification of non - gaussian bulk correlations relies on the large dimension or long - range limit of the models to be discussed in section  [ sec : lattice ] ( note that the bulk gaussian approximation was not made in the theoretical studies noted above @xcite ) . anticipating section  [ sec : lattice ] , we assume that the correlation of @xmath37 for the impurity physics are fully characterized by the 2-point correlation @xmath124 integrating out @xmath37 from eq .",
    "( [ zphichi ] ) , we obtain a ` local ' partition function which involves a functional integral over fields that depend only upon @xmath43 @xmath125 where the indices @xmath126 .",
    "however , we have written the partition function in a manner so that it can be used for general @xmath123 , and the limit @xmath127 is well - defined .",
    "indeed , an explicit solution can be obtained in the large @xmath123 limit @xcite , as we now describe .",
    "an examination of the feynman graph expansion shows that the limit of large @xmath123 is dominated by @xcite the ` rainbow ' ( or ` non - crossing ' ) graphs for the fermion green s function : see fig .",
    "[ fig : rainbow ] .    .",
    "each line , full or dashed , carries a su(@xmath123 ) index @xmath128.,width=384 ]    the summation of these graphs can be written analytically in terms of the following self - consistency conditions on the fermion self energy .",
    "as usual , we define the fermion green s function g by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is imaginary - time ordering , and @xmath131 is a matsubara frequency .",
    "this green s function is expressed in terms of the self energy by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the saddle - point value of @xmath134 .",
    "then , in the large @xmath123 limit , it is not difficult to show that the fluctuations of @xmath135 about its saddle point can be neglected , and the self energy is given by @xmath136 finally , the fermion number constraint @xmath137 , is equivalent to @xmath138    we are now faced with the mathematical problem of solving the eqs  ( [ g2],[g3],[g4 ] ) for the unknown functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 , and the value of @xmath133 . while this is not difficult to do numerically @xcite for a general @xmath141 , we present here an analytic solution in the limit of low energies for the case of critical correlations in @xmath141 .",
    "when the bulk theory is a cft , we expect a power - law decay @xmath142 , with @xmath143 a critical exponent .",
    "we generalize this to @xmath144 , with the ` conformal ' form @xmath145 where @xmath146 is some real constant .",
    "this is the general form of a @xmath144 correlator at @xmath147 for a cft2 , and holds also for @xmath97 in the upper - critical dimension @xmath4 which is the only case where the present gaussian approximation for @xmath37 correlations is appropriate .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) is supposed to be valid at energies well below the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath148 ; in other words , for @xmath149 .",
    "we will now show that the solution of eqs  ( [ g2],[g3],[g4 ] ) has the following form at long times @xcite @xmath150 and determine the exact values of @xmath151 and the exponent @xmath152 . again",

    "( [ gs1 ] ) is only the singular low frequency term , and an additional cutoff - dependent constant has been omitted .",

    "( [ g2 ] ) .",

    "( [ zchi2 ] ) in the large-@xmath123 limit have a solution which has a conformally - invariant structure at low energies @xcite .",
    "we then observe that the supersymmetric model in eq .",
    "( [ zsym ] ) also has correlators which have a conformal structure , inherited from the ads@xmath1 geometry @xcite .",
    "this is then further evidence for the striking connection between the quantum impurity models of this section and the theories of gravity on ads@xmath1 .",
    "it is also useful to collect results for the impurity spin correlation function @xmath163 from the present large @xmath123 solution . using the su(2 ) relation @xmath164 , and evaluating eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) in the large @xmath123 limit , we find @xmath165 , and so @xmath166 where the exponent @xcite @xmath167 of course , in the large @xmath123 limit we have @xmath168 , but we have introduced an independent exponent @xmath169 for @xmath170 because we expect that at higher orders in @xmath71 we have @xmath171 . on the other hand , it has been argued @xcite that the exponent relationship in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) is _ exact _ , and holds to all orders in the @xmath71 expansion for the theory in eq .",
    "( [ zchi2 ] ) .",
    "this exponent relationship is a consequence of the fact that the gaussian field @xmath37 and the spin operator @xmath74 are conjugate operators in the second term of @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ zphi ] ) , and the co - efficient of this term reaches a fixed - point value in the rg .    finally , this large @xmath123 computation can also be used to compute the impurity entropy .",
    "this requires a somewhat more involved computation @xcite , and will not be presented here .",
    "the quantum impurity models discussed in section  [ sec : qimp ] now appear to be very well understood : the results of different expansion methods are consistent with each other , and with a variety of numerical studies . and for the supersymmetric impurity models , the ads / cft method yields similar results using the geometry of ads@xmath1 .    in this section ,",
    "we move beyond impurity models to a variety of lattice models . in condensed matter studies ,",
    "this is done by using various expansion methods or physical arguments to motivate a specific mean - field decoupling of the quantum lattice model to a preferred ` impurity ' spin coupled to a bulk ` environment ' .",
    "the resulting mean - field theory then has a structure similar to the models considered in section  [ sec : qimp ] .",
    "however , now the ` environment ' is built out of the same degrees of freedom that yielded the ` impurity ' spin .",
    "this fact leads to an additional self - consistency condition that supplements the solution of the impurity model ; it is their combination which then yields the mean - field predictions for the quantum lattice model .",
    "as we will see below , the resulting mean - field theory of the lattice model has strong similarities to the classical gravity theories of ads@xmath20 at non - zero @xmath14 which were outlined in section  [ sec : intro ] . in the latter theories , the geometry factorizes to ads@xmath21 at low energies ; it is this factorization which will be seen to be related to the ` impurity ' + ` environment ' factorization of the condensed matter mean - field theories .",
    "a notable fact is that the factorization is motivated in the gravity theory from a very different reasoning from that in the condensed matter model .",
    "thus the appearance of similar result in two very different approximations is quite surprising , and indicates a robustness of the theory that should be well worth understanding better .",
    "returning to the condensed matter perspective , let us describe the mapping from lattice models to self - consistent quantum impurity models .",
    "such a mapping has been carried out for a variety of models @xcite , which are all versions of the kondo lattice hamiltonian @xmath172 here @xmath173 is a quantum spin model just as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sshj ] ) . to these localized spins",
    ", we have added mobile conduction electrons : @xmath174 is the fourier transform of the electron operator @xmath175 on site @xmath29 and @xmath176 is the electron dispersion . finally .",
    "@xmath177 is the kondo exchange coupling between the conduction electrons and the spins .",
    "the most direct mean - field analyses of @xmath178 appear in lattice models with random infinite - range exchange interactions @xcite : the @xmath55 being independent gaussian random variables with zero mean .",
    "note that the disorder is ` quenched ' _",
    "i.e. _ each @xmath55 is independent of time , but is chosen at random from a gaussian distribution .",
    "however , similar mean field equations also arise in the large spatial dimension limit of non - random kondo lattice models @xcite .",
    "such mean field models yield solutions corresponding to the two classes of non - magnetic metallic states expected in kondo lattice models @xcite :    * a fermi liquid ( fl ) with a ` large fermi surface ' , which can be viewed as arising from the rg flow to large @xmath177 . here the electrons forming the @xmath26 spins , along with the @xmath179 electrons , become part of the luttinger count which determines the volume enclosed by the fermi surface . * a fractionalized fermi liquid ( ffl or fl * ) with a ` small fermi surface ' , in which the effects of @xmath177 can be accounted for perturbatively . here",
    "the @xmath74 spins form a spin liquid , while the conduction electrons form a fermi surface whole volume counts only the density of the @xmath179 conduction electrons .",
    "let us describe the mean - field structure of the fl * phase so obtained @xcite .",
    "it was found that correlations of the spin liquid sector of this phase are described by a quantum impurity theory which is identical to eq .",
    "( [ zchi2 ] ) . however , this theory now has an additional self - consistency condition that the ` environment ' spins @xmath37 are the same as the impurity spin @xmath74 : thus the two - point correlator of @xmath37 which appears in eqs  ( [ phid ] ) and ( [ zchi2 ] ) should be proportional to the two - point correlator of @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) : _ i.e. _ @xmath180 it was further shown that a solution of this self - consistency relation is only possible if the spectrum is gapless and has a power - law form . then from eqs .",
    "( [ dt ] ) and ( [ ct ] ) we have the exponent relation @xmath181 combining this with the exact relation in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) for the quantum impurity model , we obtain @xcite @xmath182 this is the value that corresponds to ` marginal fermi liquid ' behavior @xcite , as we will see shortly . the same value of @xmath169 is obtained in large dimension solution of non - random lattice models @xcite .",
    "the gravity approach does not fix the value of such exponents : they are related to the mass of fermions in ads@xmath20 and these are free parameters in present analyses .",
    "we have now described a mean - field state , which applies to both random and non - random models , which is a critical spin liquid .",
    "it can be viewed as a large dimension analog of the ` spin bose metal ' @xcite , in that it can be written as a theory of bosons at non - zero density which do not bose condense , but form a gapless liquid @xcite .",
    "this mean - field state has a non - zero ground state entropy density , which descends from the entropy of the quantum impurity problem .",
    "it is this critical spin liquid which has been proposed to realize the low energy physics of ads@xmath20 in a non - zero chemical potential @xmath14 .",
    "the main claim of ref .",
    "@xcite was that the theory of the holographic metal realizes the fl * phase , in a situation in which the @xmath26 spins are in the critical spin liquid state described in section  [ largen ] .",
    "the evidence for this claim so far is the gapless conformal form of the spin and fermion correlations in section  [ largen ] , the connection with ads@xmath1 of the impurity models in section  [ sec : qimp ] , and the non - zero ground state entropy density .",
    "additional evidence comes from the self - energy of the conduction electrons , @xmath175 .",
    "we can compute the conduction electron self - energy @xmath183 in the fl * phase by perturbation theory in @xmath177 ; at second order in @xmath177 we have the contribution @xcite @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a scaling function , and @xmath186 is the density of conduction electron states at the fermi level .",
    "provided @xmath187 , this is a non - fermi liquid form of the electron self energy .",
    "it is also the same result as that obtained for the holographic metal in refs .",
    "a similar analysis can be done by the present methods of the transport properties @xcite , and again agreement is obtained with the holographic results @xcite .    for the exponent @xmath188",
    "obtained @xcite by the self - consistency requirement on lattice models in eq .",
    "( [ heq1 ] ) , the self energy in eq .",
    "( [ selfc ] ) has the marginal fermi liquid form @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we note that theory of the fl * phase reviewed here @xcite , and obtained by the mapping to quantum impurity models , is an attractive candidate for describing strange metal phases . at the semi - phenomenological level , it does provide a satisfactory description of experimental observations .",
    "it is indeed quite remarkable and surprising that a similar theory has now appeared from the very different starting point of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "however , the quantum - impurity description of the fl * phase is not believed to be complete @xcite .",
    "the spin liquid constituent of this phase should have emergent gauge excitations ( like the @xmath61 gauge field in eq .",
    "( [ zz ] ) ) , and these are surely essential for a complete description of spatial correlations",
    ". so it would be interesting to find the appropriate gauge fields in the holographic theory . in this context , the recent work of nickel and son is notable @xcite , as they argue that theory of the holographic metal may indeed be missing such emergent gauge fields .",
