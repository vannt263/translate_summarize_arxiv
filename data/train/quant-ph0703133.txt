    "one supporting evidence for the paradigm is that , bipartite system represented by a separable density matrix does not violate bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "detection methods of inseparability have opened a large research field , many of which are based on the peres - horodecki test @xcite using positive but not completely positive linear maps .",
    "it is still a challenging issue to find classes of density matrices possessing nonlocal nature , other than the class of inseparable density matrices .",
    "@xcite discussed a certain nonlocality about locally nonmeasurable separable states .",
    "ollivier and zurek @xcite later introduced a measure called quantum discord defined as a discrepancy of two expressions of a mutual information that should be equivalent to each other in a classical information theory .",
    "another branch of study on quantumness was started by oppenheim and the horodecki family @xcite ; this was extensively studied by a group consisting of the horodecki family and other authors @xcite .",

    "this protocol allows only local unitary operations , attaching ancillas in separable pure states , and operations to send subsystems through a complete dephasing channel .",

    "one way to evoke a discussion on the validity of the separability paradigm is to look at the persistent question why a pseudo - pure state @xmath7 with @xmath8 an entangled pure state and @xmath9 the dimension of the hilbert space , is often regarded as a classically correlated state for small probability @xmath10 because of its separability proved by braunstein _",

    "we have considered a nonclassical correlation based on a commonly recognized paradigm other than the separability paradigm .",
    "we have introduced two measures of nonclassical correlation for the paradigm claiming that a multipartite system described by a density matrix having no product eigenbasis possesses a nonclassical correlation .",
    "a motivation to consider a paradigm other than the separability paradigm is connected to a conceptual investigation of the separability paradigm .",
    "let us consider a bipartite system to simplify the discussion .",
    "the separability paradigm says that a system described by a bipartite separable density matrix can be prepared remotely when two distant persons ( alice and bob ) receive instructions from a common source .",
    "hence there is no quantumness possessed by the system described by such a density matrix in the context of remote preparation .",
    "this assumes that a density matrix is a temporal average of instantaneous density matrices or an ensemble average whose component density matrices are accessible independently because alice and bob prepare component states one by one .",
    "nevertheless , this seems to be a non - mixing process because alice and bob have accesses to individual instances or components ; this is in contrast to usual processes in ensemble dynamics which are mixing . to make it a mixing process",
    ", they should lose their memories about time ordering of instances when the averaging is temporal averaging ; in the case of ensemble averaging , they should lose their memories about indices of components .",
    "in contrast , alice and bob do not have any memory to lose when subparts of a system are distributed to them after a joint preparation of a quantum state .",
    "thus , it is questionable to compare the amount and quality of correlation of a remotely - prepared state with those of a jointly - prepared state because the two contexts are different .",
    "the paradigm that we support in this work assumes that a density matrix having no product eigenbasis possesses nonclassical correlation .",
    "a discussion on the state preparation is not involved in its context .",
    "it is based on the problem as to whether or not off - diagonal elements of the density matrix of a multipartite system can be completely eliminated by local unitary operations .",
    "this paradigm has been widely recognized in the community while it is not considered to be a replacement of the separability paradigm .",
    "it is a highly conceptual problem as to which protocol should be a base protocol to think about correlation .",
    "we have studied two measures @xmath64 and @xmath104 of non classical correlation based on the paradigm .",
    "the former is defined as a global uncertainty while the latter is defined as a local uncertainty .",
    "these two measures are quite different in their naturalness : the former can be interpreted as the minimum uncertainty for a global observer on the total system after receiving reports on local systems ; the latter is based on some quite artificial game and is , of course , unnatural .",
    "it is thus unexpected that plotted curves of these measures are sometimes similar to each other as we have seen in numerical results .",
    "we may enjoy the advantage to use the measure @xmath104 , namely its easiness of computation .",
    "in contrast to @xmath64 , which requires a numerical search for computing its value , @xmath104 can be computed by considering a finite number of eigenvalue partitionings .",
    "a drawback is that @xmath104 is possibly small for a density matrix having many non - zero eigenvalues , as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fignume5 ] for an example .",
    "it is easy to produce mimic eigenvalues of a subsystem close to genuine ones if the number of possible partitionings is large .",
    "this drawback is related to the fact that @xmath104 is not ( fully or weakly ) additive but subadditive , in contrast to @xmath64 that is fully additive . a measure with ( full or weak ) additivity is more reliable to quantify nonclassical correlation as the system size grows .",
    "as we mentioned , there is a similarity between @xmath64 and the measure defined by groisman _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "let us consider a bipartite case .",
    "suppose that we change the definition of @xmath64 in the way that we choose the basis written as a product of two eigenbases of local systems @xmath13 and @xmath14 instead of searching the minimum over all product bases .",
    "then , this redefined measure is included in the distance measures using the discrepancy between the given bipartite density matrix @xmath20}$ ] and the schmidt state @xmath33}$ ] .",
    "the measure @xmath64 is thus close to the measures defined as a discrepancy between @xmath20}$ ] and some specific density matrix having product eigenbasis ( this can be the one that minimizes the distance , or some particular one to simplify the computing process ) .    finally , we take a brief look at an ongoing development in measures of nonclassical correlation .",
    "one of the measures very recently proposed by piani _",
    "@xcite is designed to quantify nonclassical correlation in the same paradigm as presently employed .",
    "it is their measure @xmath217 defined in a similar way as that of quantum discord @xcite : @xmath217 is a discrepancy between the quantum mutual information @xcite , @xmath218})$ ] , calculated for a bipartite density matrix @xmath20}$ ] and @xmath219}]$ ] with two measurement maps @xmath220 and @xmath221 associated to povms .",
    "they also showed a straightforward extension of their theory to the multipartite case .",
    "an advantage of @xmath217 is that it vanishes if and only if @xmath20}$ ] has a biproduct eigenbasis .",
    "a disadvantage is the difficulty of finding the minimum as is similar to the above - discussed disadvantage of @xmath64 .",
    "there must be a large number of measures to quantify nonclassical correlation for the paradigm ; this is reminiscent of the dawn of entanglement measures .",
    "it is hoped that the paradigm will be studied extensively to extend another branch of quantum information science than the branch of the separability paradigm .",
    "two measures of nonclassical correlation have been introduced to support the paradigm claiming that a multipartite system described by a density matrix having no product eigenbasis possesses nonclassical correlation .",
    "the measure @xmath64 has been defined as the minimum uncertainty about a joint system after we collect outcomes of particular local measurements .",
    "the measure @xmath104 has been defined in the following way : consider the minimum distance between a set of mimic eigenvalues and a set of genuine eigenvalues of a local system on the basis of an artificial game .",
    "the measure is defined by taking the maximum of this minimum distance over all local systems .",
    "we have shown that @xmath64 is fully additive and @xmath104 is subadditive .",
    "numerical computations of @xmath64 and @xmath104 have been performed by using a random search of local bases and a non - probabilistic search of mimic eigenvalues , respectively .",
