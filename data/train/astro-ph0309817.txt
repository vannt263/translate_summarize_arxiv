    "the purpose of this paper is to outline some problems related to the measurements of the dimensionless fundamental constants from quasar ( qso ) absorption - line spectra : the fine - structure constant @xmath16 and the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath6 , which characterize the strength of electromagnetic and strong interactions , respectively .",
    "the current interest in this field stems from the prospect of using the high - resolution spectra of extragalactic objects to measure with high accuracy the transition energies of a certain ionic species and molecules at different cosmological redshifts @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the observed wavelength of a given ionic transition and @xmath19 is the corresponding rest frame ( laboratory ) value .",
    "modern observational data are ranging from @xmath20 ( the milky way ) up to @xmath21 ( distant qsos ) . ] .",
    "if physical constants varied in the past , then the comparison of the transition energies measured from qso spectra with their laboratory values provides direct astrophysical constraints on the ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 over a cosmological time - scale ( @xmath24 yr ) .",
    "we define @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where index @xmath17 marks the values of the fine - structure constant and the proton - to - electron mass ratio at redshift @xmath17 , whereas their laboratory values at @xmath20 are denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively is sometimes referred to its inverse value , @xmath29 . in this case",
    "@xmath30 . ] .",
    "at present , these constants are measured with the relative accuracies @xmath31 and @xmath32 and their values are equal to @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the variability of the fundamental constants was firstly suggested by milne  @xcite and dirac  @xcite who assumed that the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath35 may change in cosmic time .",
    "different functional forms for the time variations of @xmath35 and other constants were later considered in a series of publications ( see  @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "the variability of @xmath27 caused by a coupling between electromagnetism and gravity is considered within the framework of different modifications of the kaluza - klein theory ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the number of theoretical publications on this topic is considerably increased in the last two years .    for astronomical observations",
    ", it is more convenient to deal with dimensionless constants since they are independent on the choice of physical units .",
    "that is why most efforts to reveal hypothetical variability of constants are connected with measurements of @xmath27 ( see  @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "first observational study ( 1967 ) of the time dependence of @xmath27 from qso absorption spectra was based on the analysis of alkali doublets ( ad method ) and yielded @xmath36 at @xmath37  @xcite . since then , there have been made many other ad studies of @xmath38 with increasing accuracy in accord with increasing quality of observations : @xmath39 at @xmath40  @xcite , @xmath41 at @xmath42  @xcite , @xmath43 at @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "however , the use of absorption lines from different multiplets in different ions , the so - called many - multiplet ( mm ) method , may in principle increase the accuracy of these @xmath3 estimations @xcite .    applying the mm method to three samples of keck / hires qso data , murphy et al .",
    "@xcite obtained a statistically significant negative value of @xmath45 in the redshift interval @xmath46 . in spite of all advantages of the mm method ,",
    "the result is nevertheless surprising since it implicitly assumes extremely stable conditions during the observing nights and unrealistically homogeneous physical parameters in the absorption clouds .",
    "we consider computational caveats of the ad and mm methods in section  2 .",
    "it should be emphasized that recent improvements in meteoritic abundance determinations lead to the bound @xmath47 at @xmath48  @xcite which contradicts the mm measurements  @xcite at the same redshift .",
    "if @xmath27 is supposed to be time dependent , the other gauge coupling constants should also depend on time as predicted by theoretical models of the fundamental physical interactions ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "however , the relation between the variations of the low energy gauge couplings is highly model dependent .",
    "for instance , within the framework of a unified theory [ e.g. , supersymmetric su(5 ) ] the time variation of the qcd scale parameter @xmath49 leads to the change of the proton mass @xmath50 which is proportional to the shift @xmath3",
    "@xcite : @xmath51 where the factor @xmath10 is known with large theoretical uncertainties  @xcite",
    ".    theoretically predicted numerical value of @xmath10 can be tested by measuring the electronic - vibrational - rotational lines of the h@xmath8 molecule observed in qso spectra at high-@xmath17 as described in  @xcite .",
    "we discuss this test in section  3 .",
    "our conclusions and remarks for future prospects are summarized in section  4 .",
    "the value of the fine - structure constant @xmath52 at redshift @xmath17 can be directly estimated from the relative wavelength separation between the fine - splitting lines of an alkali doublet ( ad method )  @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are , respectively , the fine - structure separation and the weighted mean wavelength for a given doublet from a qso absorption system at redshift @xmath17 , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the same quantities from laboratory data .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath58 in the individual measurement can be estimated from  @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 are , respectively , the errors of the wavelengths in the absorption system and laboratory .",
    "equation  ( [ 10e2 ] ) shows that the ad method uses only the wavelength ratios and thus it does not require the measurements of absolute wavelengths .",
    "this fact excludes large systematic errors caused by the wavelength calibration in a wide spectral range .",
    "therefore the accuracy of the ad measurements is mainly restricted by statistical fluctuations in the recorded counts at different wavelengths within the line profile .",
    "the measurement of the line profile parameters and their errors are thoroughly described in  @xcite .",
    "the midpoint @xmath64 of an interval over @xmath65 pixels covering the line profile can be calculated from the equations @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the equivalent width , @xmath69 is the wavelength interval between pixels , @xmath70 is the observed count rate at pixel @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the continuum count rate at pixel @xmath71 , and @xmath73 is the wavelength at pixel @xmath71 .",
    "the errors in @xmath64 and @xmath68 caused by counting statistic and the uncertainty of the overall height of the continuum level are given by  @xcite : @xmath74^{1/2 } , \\label{10e6}\\ ] ] and @xmath75^{1/2 } , \\label{10e6a}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the inverse mean signal - to - noise @xmath79 ratio over the line measurement interval , and @xmath80 is the mean accuracy of the continuum level .    if the rms error of the wavelength scale calibration is @xmath81 , then the total error is given by the sum @xmath82 the error of the wavelength scale calibration is related to the radial velocity accuracy as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the speed of light .",
    "for example , @xmath85  for vlt / uves data  @xcite corresponds at 5000   to @xmath86 km  s@xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath88  , then for the mgii @xmath89  doublet ( [ 10e3 ] ) gives @xmath90 at @xmath91 , which is a typical accuracy for the individual ad estimations from isolated doublets with @xmath92 m .",
    "equation  ( [ 10e6 ] ) shows that @xmath93 decreases linearly with @xmath68 , meaning that , not surprisingly , the error for weak absorption lines ( @xmath94  ) may be very large .",
    "for example , the rest - frame equivalent widths for feii @xmath95   and @xmath96   at @xmath97 toward q00002620 measured from the keck / hires data are @xmath98  and @xmath99",
    "  @xcite , i.e. the measured errors @xmath93 for these lines should differ by @xmath100 times .",
    "it is clear that to achieve the highest accuracy in the @xmath3 estimations by means of the the ad method only well separated and unsaturated doublets with @xmath92 m should be selected for the analysis .",
    "the many - multiplet ( mm ) method is a generalization of the ad method ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the method uses many transitions from different multiplets and different ions observed in a qso absorption system .",
    "the line profiles selected for the mm analysis are represented by a sum of the same number of components ( voigt profiles ) each of which is defined by three individual parameters ( the column density , the doppler width or @xmath101-parameter , and the redshift @xmath102 ) and a common value of @xmath3 .",
    "the rest wavenumbers in the mm method can be altered according to  @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath106 are the rest - frame wavenumbers of a transition in a qso system with redshift @xmath17 and measured in the laboratory , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity coefficients @xmath107 ( determining the sensitivity of @xmath106 to the variation of @xmath27 ) are listed in table  2 in  @xcite .",
    "all parameters are estimated through the minimization of @xmath108 simultaneously for the whole set of lines .",
    "a significant improvement in the accuracy of the @xmath3 estimations by the mm method compared to the ad method is due to a wide range of the @xmath107 values ( see section  2.3 below ) . nevertheless , the mm method has some immanent shortcomings which could affect the claimed accuracy @xmath109 .",
    "first of all , the weakest point of the mm method is the multiple velocity component voigt profile deconvolution . from mathematical point of view ,",
    "any deconvolution itself is a typical _ ill - posed _",
    "problem  @xcite .",
    "when several smoothing operators ( like convolution with the spectrograph point - spread function , summing , and integrating ) are involved in the minimization procedure , the ill - posing may cause quite ambiguous results . in case of complex line profiles",
    "when many components are required to describe the whole profile , the fitting parameters can not be estimated with high accuracy because of strong _ inter - parameter correlations_. for example , the value of @xmath3 can be artificially constrained by the increase of the component number or by variations of @xmath101-values .",
    "thus , to enhance the reliability of the results only simple line profiles ( requiring minimum number of components ) should be taken into mm analysis .    from physical point of view",
    ", the voigt profile deconvolution assumes that the complex profile is caused by separate clouds lined along the line of sight with different radial velocities , each having its own constant gas density , kinetic temperature and , hence , its own ionization state .",
    "however , observations of qsos have shown that with increasing spectral resolution more and more subcomponents appear in the line profile .",
    "this complexity indicates that , in general , metal lines arise in continuous turbulent media with fluctuating velocity and density fields .",
    "we note in passing that the highest spectral resolution achieved in observations of qsos at modern giant telescopes is @xmath110 km  s@xmath87 ( @xmath111 ) , whereas the expected values for minimum ( thermal ) widths of metal lines are less or about 1  km  s@xmath87 for typical kinetic temperatures 100  k @xmath112",
    "k. this means that we are still not able to measure directly the true intensity in the line profile but observe only the apparent intensity which is a convolution of the true spectrum and the spectrograph point - spread function .",
    "thus , to measure the transition energies , the distribution function of the radial velocities within the intervening cloud must be known for the ad method , whereas the mm method requires in addition the knowledge of the density distribution , for it deals with ions of different elements which may not arise co - spatially  @xcite . since the velocity and density distributions are determined from the same line profiles which are used in the measurements of @xmath3 , it is not possible to discriminate among kinematic effects and possible changes in @xmath27 on the basis of only one absorption system .",
    "but if we have many absorption systems , statistical approach may probably solve this problem if shifts in the measured @xmath3 values are of random nature and , thus , can be averaged out in a large ensemble of absorption systems where any deviations in velocity distributions of different ions are equally probable .",
    "shifts in @xmath3 may also arise if the main assumption of the mm method that different ionic species trace exactly each other in their space distribution is not adequate .",
    "dissimilarities in the line profiles of different ions may be caused by density fluctuations leading to inhomogeneous photoionization in the absorption cloud .",
    "the qso absorption clouds is a very inhomogeneous population .",
    "their linear sizes , @xmath113 , can be estimated from the observed neutral hydrogen column densities , @xmath114(hi ) @xmath115 @xmath116 , and the estimated gas number densities , @xmath117 @xmath118 , giving @xmath119(hi)@xmath120 10s pc ",
    "the intervening clouds may also contain small dense filaments with much higher densities ( @xmath121 @xmath118 ) and the line - of - sight sizes less than 1  pc  @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the metal absorbers in qso spectra are in photoionization equilibrium with the ambient metagalactic uv background . to describe the thermal and the ionization state of the gas in the diffuse clouds it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless ` ionization parameter ' @xmath122 , equal to the ratio of the number of photons in 1 @xmath123 with energies above one rydberg to the gas number density .    for illustrative purpose",
    ", we will assume that the uv background is not time or space dependent and that its shape and intensity is given by the metagalactic spectrum at @xmath124 presented in  @xcite ( @xmath125 @xmath118 ) .",
    "then fractional ionizations @xmath126 ( with @xmath127 being the local number density of element ` @xmath69 ' and @xmath128 the density of ions in the @xmath71th ionization state ) of different elements can be calculated as functions of @xmath129 using the photoionization code cloudy  @xcite .     vs. the ionization parameter @xmath130 in case of the haardt - madau  @xcite metagalactic uv background at @xmath124 and metallicity @xmath131 .",
    "similarity of the line profiles of a pair of ions ` @xmath69 ' and ` @xmath101 ' requires the fractional ionization ratio @xmath132 to be constant for different @xmath129 ]    figure  1 shows these results for a metallicity @xmath131 ( typical for the qso metal absorbers ) and for the elements involved in the mm analysis in  @xcite .",
    "similar profiles for different ions can only be observed when the ratios @xmath133 are constant , i.e. , the curves in fig .",
    "1 are parallel .",
    "this condition is realized for mgi , mgii , alii , siii , feii , niii , and znii in the range @xmath134 , i.e. , for the most dense volumes of the cloud .",
    "such dense clumps ( filaments ) have , however , a negligible filling factor since their sizes are small , and , thus , the most of the diffuse cloud is filled up by a rarefied , low density gas characterized by higher values of @xmath130 . in the range @xmath135 ,",
    "the diversity of the @xmath136 values is considerable and one may expect to observe nonsimilar profiles of the above mentioned ions . under these circumstances , in order to be more secure the mm method should work with homogeneous samples of ions which have undoubtly the same volume distribution like , e.g. , feii lines .",
    "note that aliii is obviously not a good candidate for mm calculations since the shape of the @xmath137 curve clearly differs from the others .",
    "the fact that no additional scatter in @xmath3 for systems containing aliii was found in  @xcite may imply that the available spectral resolution is not high enough to obtain the true profiles of the metal lines .    to conclude this section we comment on the accuracy @xmath58",
    "which can be in principle achieved from the up - to - date qso observations . using the method of error propagation , one finds from ( [ 10e9 ] ) the relative error of @xmath105 : @xmath138 here @xmath139 is the dimensionless sensitivity coefficient .",
    "for the lines listed in table  2 in  @xcite , the @xmath140 values are ranging from @xmath141 ( crii @xmath142  ) to 0.050 ( znii @xmath143  ) , however , for the most frequently used transitions in the mm calculations ( table  1 in  @xcite ) , this range is narrower : @xmath140(mgii @xmath144  ) = 0.0034 , and @xmath140(feii @xmath145  ) = 0.035 .",
    "these numbers show that the error of the sample mean @xmath109 found in  @xcite requires the relative error @xmath146 , meaning that the sample mean wavelength accuracy should be @xmath147  at 2000  ( @xmath148 ) , which is equal to the radial velocity accuracy of @xmath149 m  s@xmath87 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "even if the individual measurement is an order of magnitude less accurate as compared to the sample mean , the uncertainty of @xmath151 m  s@xmath87 seems to be hardly realized for all systems collected in  @xcite .",
    "namely , the thermal shifts of order 300 m  s@xmath87 are expected if temperature changes on 0.5  k between the science and calibration spectra exposures  @xcite .",
    "absorption system toward the quasar he  05154414 ( normalized intensities are shown by dots ) .",
    "the mean signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios per resolution element are indicated , scaledwidth=100.0% ]      the standard mm method based on the multiple velocity component voigt profile fit to the complex spectra when @xmath3 is treated as an additional free parameter  @xcite can be easily modified to be free from the uncertainties mentioned in the previous section . by its very nature , the mm method is similar to that developed in @xcite for the @xmath152 calculations .",
    "so , by analogy ,",
    "we can re - write ( [ 10e9 ] ) in the linear approximation ( @xmath153 ) in the form @xmath154 where the slope parameter @xmath155 is given by @xmath156 here @xmath157 .    lccccr & @xmath158 & @xmath159  & @xmath68 , m & @xmath17 & + 1608.45085(8)&0.0580@xmath160&3456.7176(46)&7.8(1.8)&1.1490975(28)&@xmath161 + 2344.2130(1)&0.1140@xmath160&5037.9398(23)&27.5(1.6)&1.1490964(10)&0.0294(35 ) + 2374.4603(1)&0.0313@xmath160&5102.9319(79)&8.4(1.5)&1.1490913(33)&0.0389(35 ) + 2382.7642(1)&0.3006@xmath162&5120.8015(22)&61.0(1.9)&1.1491012(9)&0.0357(36 ) + 2586.6496(1)&0.0684@xmath163&5558.9439(29)&20.1(1.4)&1.1490904(11)&0.0393(39 ) + 2600.1725(1)&0.2239@xmath162&5588.0269(21)&59.1(2.0)&1.1490985(8)&0.0353(39 ) +   +   +    [ 10t1 ]    if @xmath3 is not zero , there should be a correlation between @xmath102 ( @xmath164 ) and @xmath165 , and the regression parameters @xmath166 and @xmath155 can be estimated from the measured centers of the isolated metal lines .    for instance , feii lines listed in table  2 in  @xcite , for which the @xmath140 values are ranging in the broad interval between @xmath167 and 0.035 , may be suitable for such calculations .",
