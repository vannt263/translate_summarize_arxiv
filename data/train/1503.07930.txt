    "structures @xcite .    in _ origami _ , the `` inverse problem '' of prescribing a set of folds to achieve a target structure has been algorithmically solved .",
    "for instance the circle / river packing method can be used to create the 2d `` base '' of the final product which is then augmented with extra folds into the desired 3d shape @xcite .",
    "a different method wraps the initial flat sheet onto a polygonally - tiled target surface , using `` tucking molecules '' to hide the excess material within the final shape , and thus creates curvature @xcite .",
    "further , software has been developed by the same author to form developable , irregularly corrugated target configurations by modifying _ miura - ori _ style patterns @xcite .",
    "there are , nevertheless , certain limits and constraints in the use of _ origami _ to design generic structures .",
    "these problems center around the potential complexity of the initial fold pattern , and the subsequent greatly magnified complexity of the required sequence of folds along this pattern .",
    "for instance , the fold patterns specified by the circle / river packing algorithms return a pattern whose folded state matches a target surface , but there is no guarantee that any subset of creases can be folded ; complex models of this type are typically pre - creased and then folded in a very specific and repetitive sequence .",
    "the polygonally - tiled surfaces created by the tucking - molecule method are the product of intricately interlocking crimp folds hidden away beneath the surface .",
    "both of these features reflect the fact that typically complex origami designs do not permit a monotonic , continuous folding motion from the planar state to the desired target state .",
    "these extremely delicate fold patterns present an obvious challenge to the goal of designing self - assembling _ origami _ structures , where in many cases extremely fine control of the fold ordering may be required . additionally , these fold patterns often waste much of the surface to create effective areas of gaussian curvature , using extremely intricate folds , wedges , and pleats to effectively `` remove '' material , hiding it beneath the visible surface .",
    "recently we introduced lattice _",
    "methods to this design problem @xcite ; inspired by the work of sadoc , rivier , and charvolin on phyllotaxis @xcite we supplemented the folds of _ origami _ with a limited set of cutting and re - gluing moves taking place on a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the essence of our _ kirigami _ constructions is that after making the prescribed cuts and identifying edges we have a surface with localized points of gaussian curvature , which cause the surface to buckle into a three - dimensional configuration .",
    "associated folding then precisely defines the shape of the surface , corralling the points of gaussian curvature into useful cues that direct the shape of the final structure .    the restrictions imposed on _ kirigami _ by the honeycomb lattice and its triangular dual lattice led to a manageable set of allowed motifs : 2 - 4 disclination pairs on the honeycomb lattice and @xmath0-@xmath1 disclination pairs on the dual lattice ( dual lattice constructs are denoted by tildes ) that could be connected to other disclination pairs with cancelling burgers vectors by paths with glide and ( sometimes partial ) climb geometries .",
    "another allowed _ kirigami _ motif is the `` sixon , '' a defect formed by completely removing one hexagon from the honeycomb lattice and reconnecting the cut edges of the remaining surface in one of several degenerate ways .",
    "one configuration of the sixon identifies pairs of adjacent edges so that three triangular plateaus emanate from a central point ; another configuration leads to matching 2 - 4 pairs in a `` pop - up / pop - down '' configuration @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that arrangements of these _ kirigami _ motifs enables a remarkably versatile ability to design patterns whose cut - and - folded state matches a desired target surface , allowing us to algorithmically solve the inverse design problem for a particular class of surfaces with a specified maximum gradient .    of particular interest in the potential for self - assembling designs ,",
    "the _ kirigami _ design paradigms we propose are simple  to the extent of being easily designed by hand  and robust to the ordering and relative rates of edge folding .",
    "in what follows we will first describe a simple solution to the inverse - design problem of creating a stepped surface with assigned heights at each point by arranging paired @xmath0-@xmath1 pairs along the lattice vectors of a larger superimposed honeycomb lattice .",
    "the excised patches define the location of the points of gaussian curvature and the designation of mountain and valley folds defines the height .",
    "we then present a second method using the same principle in a more refined manner to produce a reconfigurable surface . by invoking the degeneracy and flexibility of the sixon structure",
    "we can design a pluripotent lattice of sixons that can be folded into a dizzying array of target shapes by selectively assigning their mountain and valley folds .",
    "figure [ fig:5_7_iso ] depicts a single @xmath0-@xmath1 climb pair element , where an extended hexagon is excised from the sheet , its edges are identified , and mountain and valley folds perpendicular to the short sides of the excised hexagon are applied .",
    "the two regions labeled `` p '' can independently pop - up or pop - down relative to their initial configuration , depending on the fold choices .",
    "in contrast , the regions labeled `` r '' share an edge in the folded configuration , and therefore must be at the same height .",

    "we demonstrate this by designing a _ kirigami _ ziggurat , which we then realize in a simple experimental setting @xcite .",
    "however , even aside from the restrictions imposed by the junction rules described above , these @xmath0-@xmath1 climb pair _ kirigami _ designs share one of the fundamental limitations of the origami patterns : for every desired target surface an entirely new pattern of cuts has to be programmed into the sheet , and only then can the folds can be made .",
    "in many contexts we would prefer a pluripotent _ kirigami _ blueprint .",
    "similar in spirit to the universal hinge pattern for making generic polycubes @xcite , we desire a single arrangement of kirigami elements that can accommodate many different target structures , all accessed by entirely local sequences of fold reassignments ( _ i.e. _ changing a local set mountain folds to a valley folds , and _",

    "we show that a triangular lattice of sixons can achieve precisely this goal .",

    "if the sheet can bend and stretch as in bistable _ origami _",
    "@xcite , transforming from the ground state to these excited states only requires opening and then re - closing the three excised hexagons that bound the relevant triangular plateau . otherwise , to avoid tearing or bending while moving from one target to another , it is necessary to return to the completely flat state .",
    "the requirements that folds be commensurate and the sheet not stretch impose the only restriction on allowed excitations : the height of any triangle in the folded configuration must differ by one from the height of any triangle with which it shares an edge .",

    "achievable target surfaces are limited only to have a maximum gradient set by the ratio of plateau height to plateau width .",
    "if the gradient of the target surface obeys this bound , finding the _ kirigami _ solution to the inverse design problem is as straightforward as projecting the heights of a target surface down onto a triangular lattice , and then rounding the height assignment of each triangle to the nearest even or odd integer so that triangles sharing an edge will have heights that differ by exactly one . indeed ,",
    "if there is a known maximum gradient among the target surfaces into which a sixon array will be ( re-)configured , the cut sizes determining the ratio of plateau height to width can be chosen to match this maximum gradient . from the triangular height map",

    "we have demonstrated that adding _ kirigami _ cutting motifs to the folds of _ origami _ leads to a powerful framework in which target structures can be algorithmically designed _ via _ arrays of _ kirigami _ elements .",
    "subject to a gradient constraint , using a super - lattice simplifies the design for a static target surface , while triangular lattices of sixons form a versatile base pattern able to accommodate fold patterns for any stepped triangulated target structure . if the material allows for dynamic changing of fold type then the sixon lattice can be reconfigured between arbitrary surface configurations .",
    "current studies involve designing pluripotent _ kirigami _ templates that lift the gradient limitation as well as other geometric and topological limits .",
    "we note that our choice of triangular plateaus and sixons was a powerful but not entirely unique choice with which to engineer a pluripotent sheet of kirigami elements .",
    "we show in the supporting information that using square plateaus leads to a similar ( but more restrictive ) design paradigm @xcite .    of particular importance , we note that our _ kirigami _ designs are superior to many _ origami _",
    "designs for comparable results , especially in relation to self - assembly .",
    "for example , our experimental realization of a ziggurat - style pryamid @xcite  actuated by heat - shrink tape placed across the short axis of the excised hexagons  makes it clear that in our _ kirigami _ constructions the fold process is very robust .",
    "that is , in contrast with the _ origami _ methods discussed above , detailed control over the folds is not necessary to correctly form the target structure . also , unlike some _ origami _",
    "designs , this _ kirigami_-based approach to approximating surfaces with sixons maintains a constant complexity of fold pattern per unit surface area .",
    "the underlying structure is always a triangular lattice of sixons , and different surfaces differ in their folding template only by switching mountain and valley folds as needed .",
    "because the folds connecting sixons are coupled , a triangular lattice of sixons has more fold lines than degrees of freedom .",
    "this attribute could be exploited to create truly multi - potent kirigami sheets by partitioning the folds into non - overlapping sets and programming each of those sets to fold in response to different stimuli .",
    "we schematically illustrate such a `` duo - potent '' sheet in the supporting information @xcite , programming half of the fold lines to form a half - cylinder when activated , while the other half of the fold lines transform the sheet into a mexican hat potential .",
    "this raises the exciting prospect that , with dynamical control over the fold type , a single lattice of sixons could serve as the base for , _ e.g. _ microfluidic devices with dynamically changeable channels .",
    "work on implementing such a dynamically reconfigurable _ kirigami _ surface is currently underway .",
