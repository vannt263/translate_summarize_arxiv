    "recent years have witnessed many breakthroughs in research on two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials due to their potential applications in next - generation electronic and energy conversion devices @xcite .",
    "recently , a new type of 2d material , borophene ( 2d boron sheet ) @xcite , has been successfully grown on single crystal ag(111 ) substrates by two parallel experiments @xcite .",
    "although various proposals of stable 2d boron sheets and quasiplanar boron clusters have been made @xcite , three main structures ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and striped borophene ) have been observed by scanning tunneling microscopy in these two experiments : @xmath0 and @xmath1 borophene has planar structure with periodic holes @xcite , while striped borophene has buckled structure with anisotropic corrugation @xcite .",
    "the following first principles calculations have predicted that striped borophene possesses remarkable mechanical properties @xcite , which may rival graphene @xcite .",
    "however , phonon instability in striped borophene is observed @xcite , which may challenge previous results demonstrating that borophene is stiffer than graphene along @xmath2 direction @xcite .    theoretical investigation of the formation of boron sheet on ag(111 ) surface has demonstrated that stable boron sheet should contain 1/6 vacancies in a striped pattern @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with previous theoretical studies indicating that planar boron sheets with vacancies are more stable @xcite .",
    "the ground state of 2d boron is in debate @xcite .",
    "these debates raise several questions : ( i ) are these three structures stable ?",
    "( ii ) what is the relative stability of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and striped borophene ? ( iii ) could these structures possess high hardness in thermodynamic aspect ?",
    "in fact , due to the structural complexity of boron , even the relative stability of @xmath3 and @xmath4rhombohedral boron has been discussed for over 30 years @xcite . thus a systematic investigation is needed to examine the stability and strength of these three structures .    when discussing the stability of crystal structures , it is important to distinguish dynamical , thermodynamical and mechanical stability @xcite . a material is dynamically stable when no imaginary phonon frequencies exist .",
    "thermodynamical stability can be described by the helmholtz free energy @xcite , which demonstrates how phonons determine the relative stability at finite temperatures . regarding mechanical stability , the born - huang criteria for elastic constants",
    "must be fullfilled @xcite .",
    "the born - huang mechanical stability criteria provide a _ necessary _ condition for the dynamical stability , but not a _ sufficient _ one @xcite . therefore , although the mechanical properties of striped borophene have been studied intensively @xcite , the questions of stability still remain unanswered . in this work , the dynamical , thermodynamical and mechanical stabilities of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and striped borophene",
    "are evaluated using first principles calculations .",
    "we further study for the first time the mechanical properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 borophene , and compare the stiffness of three distinguished structures .",
    "the bonding characteristics are also examined to understand the stability and strength of striped borophene .",
    "three structures of borophene are shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] . for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) borophene , five ( four ) b atoms in the unit cell are arranged in the same plane . for striped borophene , there is no corrugation along @xmath2 direction , while a vertical buckling along the @xmath5 direction is observed .",
    "the major difference between striped borophene and the other two structures is the absence of vacancies .",
    "the introduction of vacancies leads to lower cohesive energy , as shown in table  [ lattice ] , which is in good agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "the optimized geometries of three structures are listed in table  [ lattice ] .",
    "the predicted @xmath2 of striped borophene corresponds to 1/3 the @xmath2 observed in the experiment , while the lattice constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 borophene is in excellent agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "thus the reliability of the present calculations is confirmed .",
    "[ band ] presents the calculated band structures of all three phases , which agree well with previous theoretical results @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that due to highly anisotropic crystal structure , striped borophene shows anisotropic metallic behaviour .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ stiff ]    using the elastic tensor , the mechanical properties such as 2d young s modulus @xmath6 and the corresponding poisson s ratio @xmath7 can be calculated @xcite , as shown in table  [ stiff ] .",
    "the calculated @xmath6 of striped borophene are in good agreement with other theoretical data @xcite .",
    "2d young s modulus is defined as the ratio between stress and strain , and provides a measure of in - plane stiffness of the solid materials .",
    "the mechanical properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 borophene are similar due to similar in - plane bonding and atomic mass density .",
    "as shown in table  [ stiff ] , the stiffness of @xmath0 and @xmath1 borophene is lower than that of graphene and monolayer bn , but higher than that of silicene @xcite .",
    "negative possion s ratio is observed in striped borophene , which is due to highly buckled structure @xcite .",
    "in addition , the stiffness for striped borophene along @xmath2 direction is much higher than that along @xmath5 direction , and even rivals graphene ( 342.2 gpa@xmath8 nm ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , although striped borophene is much stiffer than @xmath0 and @xmath1 borophene , thermodynamically , high stiffness means unstability due to increasing helmholtz free energy via the increase in vibration frequency @xcite .",
    "both the high stiffness and high instability of striped borophene along @xmath2 direction can be attributed to strong directional bonding .          to understand the chemical bonding of striped borophene",
    ", we calculate its electron localization function ( elf ) @xcite in comparison with @xmath0 borophene , which has similar 2d orthorhombic structure . a higher value of elf corresponds to higher electron localization . as shown in fig .",
    "[ elf ] , elf profiles of striped borophene is more anisotropic than that of @xmath0 borophene . strong directional bonding may prevent dislocations from forming to accommodate strains and thereby cause the material to be brittle @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with previous theoretical studies showing that striped borophene is dynamically unstable even under high tensile stress @xcite . as for @xmath0 borophene ,",
    "strong b - b bonds along different directions in the 2d plane of @xmath0 borophene stabilize the structure . thus @xmath0 borophene is more stable than striped borophene considering the bonding characteristics .    , ( b ) @xmath1 and ( c ) striped borophene . ]    we further consider the nature of the electronic bonding by calculating the projected density of states ( dos ) for three structures of borophene with separated in - plane ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath12 ) projections in fig .  [ dos ] .",
    "generally , in - plane @xmath13 bonds ( @xmath14 bonds ) are stronger than @xmath15 bonds ( @xmath16 bonds ) derived from @xmath12 orbitals . for striped borophene ,",
    "the @xmath12 projected dos vanishes from -3.5 to 2.5 ev . as a result ,",
    "localized @xmath14 bonds along @xmath2 direction are observed in elf profiles .",
    "however , these strong @xmath14 bonds will be destabilized by any flattening of the boron sheet , leading to highly metastable structure @xcite .",
    "thus striped borophene becomes instable under tension along @xmath2 direction @xcite .",
    "in addition , some of the strong in - plane @xmath13 bonding states are unoccupied in fig .",
    "[ dos](c ) , and subsequently striped borophene tends to accepting electrons to increase its stability @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , first - principles calculations are performed on 2d borophene sheet to evaluate the dynamical , thermodynamical and mechanical stability of two distinguished structures .",
    "our results show that the free - standing @xmath0 and @xmath1 borophene is thermodynamically , mechanically and dynamically stable , while striped borophene is thermodynamically and dynamically unstable due to high stiffness along @xmath2 direction .",
    "our calculated elf shows that the bonding characteristic of striped borophene leads to high stiffness and high instability at the same time .",
