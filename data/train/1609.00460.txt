    "the current transport across a schottky interface is mainly due to majority carriers . in general , there are three different transport mechanisms , namely diffusion of carriers from the semiconductor into the metal , thermionic emission of carriers across the schottky barrier and quantum - mechanical tunneling through the barrier @xcite . for the thermionic emission ,",

    "although it is well - known that the energy dispersion plays an important role in governing the schottky transport , the traditional @xmath19 model is still widely used in the vast majority of recent experimental works on schottky interfaces composed of novel materials , such as mos@xmath20 , black phosphorus , graphene and few - layer graphene , where the dispersion is highly non - parabolic @xcite . this highlights the need to reformulate the schottky model in order to uncover the underlying physics in these structures . for a monolayer graphene",

    "the @xmath22 behavior can be regarded as the _ dirac - schottky scaling relation _ and is a signature of the linear energy dispersion in graphene @xcite . as the form of the energy dispersion can crucially affect the scaling , the schottky transport model has to be reformulated for schottky interface made up of non - parabolic dispersions - based materials .",
    "the very distinct forms between the schottky @xmath5-scaling and the dirac - schottky @xmath6-scaling also prompts us to investigate whether the @xmath23 and the @xmath22 can be connected via a unique energy dispersion that is ` intermediate ' between parabolic and linear and whether graphene multilayer follows other forms of unconventional scaling relation .    in this paper",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the schottky transport in narrow - gap semiconductor and few - layer graphene in which the energy dispersions are highly non - parabolic . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the contrasting current - temperature scaling relation of @xmath0 in the conventional schottky interface and @xmath1 in graphene - based schottky interface can be reconciled under kane s @xmath2 non - parabolic band model for narrow - gap semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> our new model suggests a more general form of @xmath3 , where the non - parabolicty parameter , @xmath4 , provides a smooth transition from @xmath5 to @xmath6 scaling . for few - layer graphene </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that @xmath7-layers graphene with @xmath8-stacking follows @xmath9 while @xmath10-stacking follows a universal form of @xmath1 regardless of the number of layers . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the richardson constant extracted from the arrhenius plot using an incorrect scaling relation disagrees with the actual value by two orders of magnitude , suggesting that correct models must be used in order to extract important properties for many novel schottky devices . </S>"
