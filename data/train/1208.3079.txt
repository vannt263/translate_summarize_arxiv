    "in the past couple of decades , our understanding of the universe has flourished as a result of our new - found ability to observe in almost all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "this advance is in no small part due to our ability to associate observations at different wavelengths with particular astrophysical phenomena and link them together , making modern astronomy truly pan - chromatic . by observing an astronomical source at multiple wavelengths ,",
    "we may piece together its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and by comparing the observed sed to models , we may infer the physical properties of the source ( or sample of sources ) that we are studying .",
    "at ultraviolet , optical and near - infrared wavelengths the sed of the average galaxy is dominated by emission from stars ; there are many tens of different models to which we may compare our observations , in the hope of understanding the stellar components of astrophysical sources ( e.g. bruzual & charlot , 2003 , fioc & rocca - volmerange , 1997 , vzquez & leitherer , 2005 , anders & fritze - von alvensleben , 2003 , jimenez et al .",
    "1995 , 2004 , maraston , 2005 , pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ) . such sed model analysis may be used to determine basic properties of a galaxy s stellar components , such as its age , metallicity or stellar mass ( see e.g. carter et al . , 2009 ,",
    "smith & jarvis , 2007 , collins et al .",
    ", 2009 , pacifici et al . , 2012 , pforr , maraston &  tonini , 2012 ) .",
    "while the ultraviolet to near - infrared emission tells us about the stellar content of a normal galaxy ( subject to correcting for attenuation by dust of the different stellar components ; charlot &  fall , 2000 , tuffs et al .",
    "2004 , pierini et al .",
    "2004 ) , the far - infrared and sub - millimetre wavelengths probe its cool dust content , which is itself crucial to our understanding of star formation , since approximately half of the energy ever radiated by stars has been absorbed by dust and re - radiated at these wavelengths ( e.g. puget et al . , 1996 , fixsen et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the sub - millimetre region has been a difficult part of the electromagnetic spectrum in which to conduct large galaxy surveys ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "1997 , hughes et al .",
    "1998 , eales et al .",
    "previous ground - based sub - millimetre surveys had to be either pointed at pre - selected targets , or limited to relatively small regions of sky covering areas of @xmath6 deg@xmath7 ( coppin et al . , 2006 , weiss et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "the combined effects of the large negative @xmath8-correction at these wavelengths , sensitivity and the steep number counts , have meant that the average 850@xmath0 m selected sub - millimetre galaxy is extremely luminous ( @xmath9 ) and resides at high redshift ( @xmath10 , e.g. chapman et al .",
    "few relatively local galaxies have been found in blind sub - mm surveys , due to the small local volumes probed in these surveys coupled with the observing wavelength targetting the faint rayleigh - jeans tail of the dust sed at low redshift .",
    "our undertstanding of the local universe at sub - mm wavelengths has come so far from targetted surveys such as the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs , dunne et al .",
    "2000 ) , which observed a sample of 184 _ iras_- and optically - selected galaxies ( vlahakis , dunne & eales , 2005 ) .",
    "pre - selected galaxies in this way can lead to biases if there are classes of sub - mm emitting galaxies which are not bright at either optical or 60@xmath11 m wavelengths .",
    "the slugs surveys were also limited to very nearby galaxies and so could not address the question of evolution of sub - mm properties in the relatively recent past .    with the advent of the pacs ( poglitsch et al .",
    "2010 ) and spire ( griffin et al . 2010 ) instruments aboard the esa _ herschel space observatory _",
    "( pilbratt et al . 2010 ) , we now have our first opportunity to survey a large area of sky at sub - mm wavelengths . the angular resolution and sensitivity of _ herschel _",
    "allow us to robustly determine the counterparts to thousands of local sub - millimetre _ selected _ galaxies across the whole electromagnetic spectrum , thus gaining invaluable insight into their physical processes .",
    "this paper uses a sample from the _ herschel _ astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( _ h_-atlas : eales et al .",
    "2010 ) and presents fits to their uv  sub - mm seds .",
    "this is the first relatively local ( @xmath3 ) sub - mm selected sample for which such complete sed modelling has been performed .",
    "this work is based on only 3 percent of the final data - set , but is still large enough to provide a statistical study of the optical and ir properties of @xmath12 250@xmath0 m selected galaxies , and templates for seds which can be applied more widely .",
    "studies of the multi - wavelength properties of the relatively small number of galaxies detected in sub - millimetre surveys have been extensive ( e.g. swinbank et al .",
    "2009 ) . at high redshifts ,",
    "galaxy star formation rates have been frequently estimated based on a single sub - millimetre flux measurement ( e.g. at 850@xmath0 m ) , and a local template sed belonging to e.g. m82 or arp220 ( e.g. silva et al . , 1998 ) , chosen not because they are known to be representative of the average sub - millimetre galaxy , but rather because they are comparatively well - studied .",
    "another commonly - used method of describing far - infrared galaxy seds is to assume one or more components with modified black - body ( the so - called `` grey - body '' ) profiles . in these simple parametrisations ,",
    "the observed flux densities depend only on the temperatures ( @xmath13 ) and dust emissivity index ( @xmath14 ) , which may be either assumed or derived , depending on the available observations .",
    "such simple grey - body profiles have been widely shown to broadly reproduce the sparsely - sampled far - ir seds of galaxies at all redshifts ( e.g. dunne et al .",

    "2006 , kvacs et al .",
    "2006 , dye et al . , 2010 ) , although when the sed is sampled from 60@xmath0 m to the sub - mm additional greybody components may be required to reproduce the observations ( e.g. dunne &  eales , 2001 , galametz et al . , 2011 , smith et al .",
    "2010 , dale et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "empirical templates have been created for use with sparsely - sampled far - infrared data based on observations of small samples of local galaxies with good coverage from mid- to far - ir wavelengths ( e.g. chary &  elbaz , 2001 , dale &  helou , 2002 , rieke et al .",
    "2009 ) . selecting galaxies at shorter fir wavelengths tends to favour those with substantial warm dust components , which may not be representative of populations selected at longer wavelengths with",
    "_ herschel _ and ground based sub - mm instruments .",
    "several studies have found that sub - mm selected galaxies ( so far mostly at higher redshifts ) may have colder dust than their local equivalents at similar far infrared luminosities ( e.g. pope et al .",

    "2008 , hwang et al . , 2010 , magnelli et al . , 2012 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use a model that relies on energy balance - the idea that the energy absorbed by dust at ultra - violet and optical wavelengths must be re - radiated in the far - infrared - combined with a statistical fitting approach , to consistently model each galaxy s full sed , and gain robust constraints on the star formation activity , stellar and dust content of 250@xmath0 m selected galaxies from _ h_-atlas .    in section [ sec : data ] we discuss the _ herschel_-atlas survey and the multi - wavelength data used in generating the catalogue , while in section [ sec : method ] we discuss the sed - fitting method used in the analyses which we present in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ comparisons ]",

    "pacs sources were added to the catalogue based on the flux in apertures placed at the locations of spire 250@xmath0 m sources .",
    "the catalogue we used for this sample is 250@xmath0 m selected and contains 6621 sources at @xmath21 ( though not all of these are detected in all other bands  see below and table [ tab : coverage ] ) .",
    "the @xmath22 point source flux limits are 132 , 126 , 32 , 36 &  45 mjy in the 100@xmath0 m , 160@xmath0 m , 250@xmath0 m , 350@xmath0 m &  500@xmath0 m bands , respectively ( and including confusion ) , with beam sizes of approximately 9 , 13 , 18 , 25 and 35 arcsec fwhm in the same five bands .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     when we consider the median temperature estimates with each prior in table [ tab : prior_medians ] , we see that the second two samples  which require @xmath22 pacs detections  have higher median values due to the removal of the coldest sources from the sub - sample ; these sources are generally undetected in our comparatively shallow pacs data .",
    "the last two sub - samples in table [ tab : prior_medians ] have lower values of @xmath23 , and are mostly undetected by pacs ; in particular , the 350@xmath0 m selection criterion preferentially picks the colder sources in the catalogue , with seds peaking at longer wavelengths .    in summary , we have used the dce08 @xmath24 temperature priors for the following reasons :    * simulations and studies of the pacs - complete sample suggest that we can explain our data adequately using the dce08 prior , * the narrower prior also limits the impact of @xmath23  errors on @xmath25 , * detailed studies using a variety of multiwavelength data and modelling techniques see no evidence for substantial cold dust components with temperatures lower than 15k in the kind of dust rich spiral galaxies being investigated here ( e.g. dunne &  eales 2001 , popescu et al",

    "we took a selection of best - fit model seds , and varied their photometry according to a set of gaussian distributions with a median of zero and a standard deviation equal to the minimum photometric error in each band ( i.e. the values added in quadrature , as defined in section [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "these values were chosen since they were the dominant source of error for bright sources .",
    "we then removed a sub - set of photometry to reflect the heterogeneity within our real data set , and re - calculated their properties 1000 times each .",
    "the resulting histograms of @xmath26 values ( e.g. figure [ dofsim ] ) enabled us to estimate the number of degrees of freedom given that particular sub - set of photometry , by performing a simple minimisation of equation [ chi2dist ] to the derived @xmath26 probability density functions :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 represents the gamma function , @xmath29 the number of degrees of freedom , and @xmath26 the median @xmath26 value for each bin . due to the relatively small redshift range covered by our sample , we average each solution , and determine that the relationship between the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath30 ) and the number of photometric bands with measurements ( @xmath31 ) is given by equation [ ndof_eq ] :    @xmath32    with this information , we are then able to use equation [ chi2dist ] , in conjunction with the number of degrees of freedom estimate from equation [ ndof_eq ] , to determine a 99 per cent confidence interval on @xmath26 . those galaxies outside the interval on @xmath26 have less than 1 per cent chance of being consistent with our model . in this way",
    "we may remove those `` bad fits '' from further analysis .",
    "we derived equation [ ndof_eq ] using galaxies with between 6 and 19 detections , so these values constitute the bounds on @xmath33 over which we believe it is valid .",
    "finally , in comparing our simulations to our real sample , we note that in contrast to our simulations , the photometric errors used in our sed fitting are not strictly gaussian due to problems associated with e.g. deblending or calibration issues , particularly in regions neighbouring saturated stars , however the difference is not expected to be large .",
    "values for the one thousand galaxy simulations referred to in the text .",
    "the shape of the resulting histogram is well - described by equation [ chi2dist ] , and depends on only one parameter , the number of degrees of freedom for that particular combination of input photometry ( @xmath29 ) . in this way ,",
    "@xmath29 can then be determined for each combination of photometry by simply minimising equation [ chi2dist ] . by fitting a quadratic to these results",
    ", we may relate @xmath29 and @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting relationship is shown in equation [ ndof_eq ] . the combination of equations [ chi2dist ] & [ ndof_eq ] allows us to define 99%  confidence intervals and in turn determine which galaxies in our sample are well - described by our model . ]",
    "due to the complexity of the energy - balance sed fitting method , we wanted to perform additional checks for bias in the derived parameters , and determine which parameters depend on one another .    in turn",
    ", we calculate the variation on our key parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath25 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , sfr and ssfr ) introduced in our `` pacs - complete '' sample when the pacs data are included and when they are omitted from the fitting , as a function of each of the derived parameters included in this analysis .",
    "we consider the difference in each parameter , q ( e.g. @xmath34 , ssfr , etc ) :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the median likelihood estimates for a particular source including or ignoring the pacs information in the fitting . in this way we are able to probe for a skew in the bias between estimates of a parameter e.g. do we over - estimate @xmath34  for particular @xmath34  when galaxies are nt detected by pacs ? even though we have used our stacked pdfs to probe for overall bias and found that it is minimal for all of the key parameters that we discuss in this paper ( they are detailed in table [ tab : parameters ] ) , it is still possible that @xmath40 is skewed for some parameter combinations . in figure",
    "[ further_bias_tests ] , we plot these values along with their error bars .",
    "the individual data points are shown as red circles , with error bars in the horizontal direction derived in the absence of the pacs data .",
    "the blue solid line indicates zero offset , while the green solid line indicates the median of the stacked pdf for all galaxies in the `` pacs - complete '' sample that we explore here .    in figure [ further_bias_tests](a ) , we consider possible bias in @xmath34 .",
    "we find that there is a skewed bias between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; though the scatter is large , these tests suggest that @xmath34  is underestimated at high @xmath25  and underestimated at lower values in the absence of pacs data , though the offset averaged across the whole range of @xmath42  is small .",
    "@xmath41 appears broadly unbiased across all values of @xmath43 , while there is little evidence for any bias with respect to @xmath36 , , ( specific ) sfr or redshift .",
    "there is evidence for bias in @xmath34  with respect to @xmath25/@xmath34  and @xmath25/@xmath44 , though these biases are dominated by the bias in @xmath25  already discussed .",
    "figure [ further_bias_tests](b ) shows the variation in @xmath45 as a function of the same key parameters , suggesting that there may be a tendency to overestimate @xmath25  in the absence of pacs data at the highest dust masses probed by this study and there is a small tendency for dust masses to be overestimated in the absence of pacs data on average ( comparing the blue and green horizontal lines in figure [ further_bias_tests ] ) .",
    "the related parameters @xmath42/@xmath43and @xmath42/@xmath46 ) also show evidence for skew .",
    "figures [ further_bias_tests](c ) and ( d ) show the variation in @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; it is clear that they are unbiased with respect to the other model outputs that we use in this paper , as probed by the `` pacs - complete '' sample .",
    "though the spread in @xmath49 and @xmath50 is larger , reflected in the larger error bars in figure [ further_bias_tests](e ) &  ( f ) , it is difficult to discern any skew or bias between these parameters and the other model outputs .",
    "in order to calculate the median of an ensemble of seds , we first normalise each individual sed to the mean between 0.2 and 500@xmath0 m ( in units of @xmath51 ) , such that each template is given equal weighting in the stack , then take the median of the ensemble of normalised sed values in each wavelength bin .",
    "we also determine the 16@xmath52 and 84@xmath52 percentiles of the cumulative sed - distribution as a function of wavelength .",
    "these values provide a measure of the spread in the seds of the galaxies which go into the stack , in contrast to the estimated error on the median template shown in figure [ ssfr_variation_v2 ] , which is determined using the median statistics method of gott et al .",
    "our method of determining the range of values in our sed stacks ( i.e. the 16 - 84@xmath52 percentiles ) is illustrated in figure [ stack_method ] , in which the individual best - fit seds that go into the median template ( in this case for 216 galaxies with good fits , at @xmath53 , and with @xmath54 ) are shown in grey , while the median and the afore - mentioned percentiles are overlaid in red and blue lines , respectively .",
    "note that for the purposes of calculating these stacked templates , we bin according to the best - fit values returned from the fitting code rather than the medians of the pdf that we use for analysis elsewhere .",
    "this distinction is noteworthy since we determine only the best - fit model seds for each galaxy ( as opposed to the full pdf at each wavelength ) . whilst there is generally excellent agreement between the best - fit and the median - likelihood estimates of",
    "any given parameter , the two may differ in individual cases , adding unrealistic outliers in the stacked seds if median - likelihood values are used for these purposes .",
    "m , and then the median ( the red line ) and 16@xmath52 and 84@xmath52 percentiles of the ensemble ( blue lines ) are calculated as a function of wavelength .",
    "this particular example shows the stacked seds of those 216 galaxies with good best - fit models at @xmath53 and with @xmath55 . ]",
    "whilst this method of stacking seds determines templates designed to be representative of a typical galaxy in a given sample ( or sub - sample ) of galaxies , it is important to note that we do not expect such templates to reproduce the total cosmic spectral energy distribution ( e.g. hill et al . , 2010 , somerville et al . , 2012 , driver et al . , _ in prep",
    "_ ) , which would require calculating the sum of the emergent seds without prior normalisation .",
    "we leave further discussion of this topic for a future publication ."
