    "the study of amplification of acoustic phonons propagated along the axes of low - dimensional and bulk materials such as semiconductor superlattices ( sl )  @xcite , @xmath13-graphene sheet  @xcite , quantum wells ( qw )  @xcite , and carbon nanotubes ( cnt )  @xcite are actively persued recently using microscopic theory of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "this is due to the electronic and optoelectronic applications including the production of saser ( sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) , for dynamic storage of light in quantum wells and acoustic wave induced carrier transport  @xcite . when a non - quantizing electric field is applied to these material , and the drift velocity @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is sound velocity ) an amplification of acoustic phonons occurs but in the reverse when @xmath16 it lead to absorption of acoustic phonons .",
    "the nature of this phenomenon is related to cerenkov s emission of phonons by moving carriers  @xcite . in ssl ,",
    "amplification of acoustic phonons via cerenkov s emission was proposed theoretically by mensah et .",
    "al . ,  @xcite .",
    "the mensah formalism of intra - miniband transitions via deformation potential ( dp ) in ssl has been confirmed experimentally by shinokita  @xcite to amplify over @xmath17 of acoustic phonons .",
    "recently , a series of related studies in graphene and cnt with degenerate energy dispersion has been conducted ( theoretically ) in the hypersound regime @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the acoustic wavenumber , @xmath20 is the mean free path ) .",
    "the results obtained qualitatively agreed with an experimentally obtained results  @xcite . in multilayer - graphene - based system , yurchenko et .",

    "dagher , et .",
    "al . ,  @xcite utilised the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) to investigate the amplification of travelling waves in metallic cnt biased by a dc field .",
    "the amplification attained was as a results of bloch - type oscillations ( bto ) .",
    "in cnt , the @xmath23-bonding and anti - bonding ( @xmath24 ) energy band crosses at the fermi level in a linear manner  @xcite where , intra - band scattering process depends on the phonon modes .",
    "these modes are the longitudinal acoustci ( la ) , transverse acoustic ( ta ) and the radial breathing mode ( rbm ) which is the weakest scattering mode . for each phonon branch",
    ", an electron can be scattered either by zone center phonon , or by a zone boundary phonon .",
    "the energy dispersion @xmath25 is near the fermi level therefore , at low temperatures , conduction occurs through well seperated discrete electron states .",
    "this leads to the emission of large number of coherent acoustic phonons  @xcite .",
    "the extreme electron mobilities makes cnt , a good candidate for the amplification of acoustic phonons . till date",
    ", few studies  @xcite has been conducted to understand amplification in cnt . in this paper , we utilised the theory proposed by  @xcite and verified experimentally by  @xcite to study amplification of acoustic phonons in cnt .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section @xmath26 , the kinetic theory based on the linear approximation for the phonon distribution function is setup , where , the rate of growth of the phonon distribution is deduced and the amplification is obtained . in section @xmath27",

    "lastly the conclusion is presented in section @xmath28 .",

    "when @xmath55 , the system would return to its equilibrium configuration when perturbed but @xmath56 leads to the cerenkov condition of phonon instability ( amplification ) . from perturbation theory , the transition probability per unit time from the initial state @xmath57 , consisting of electron having momentum @xmath58 , to the final state @xmath59 , which consists of an electron with momentum @xmath60 and a phonon with wave vector @xmath19 .",
