    "once thought of as distinct ten - dimensional consistent perturbative theories , the five superstring theories are now understood as five different asymptotic expansions of a unifying eleven - dimensional m - theory in different corners @xmath2 of its moduli space , with _ string dualities _ providing the transition functions between these patches@xcite . due to the asymptotic nature of string perturbation theory , this",
    "still only covers a zero - measure set of the moduli space , while analytic continuation to finite @xmath3 can be achieved for quantities that are protected from quantum corrections , such as the bps spectrum and bps - saturated amplitudes .",
    "one - loop exact amplitudes on one patch translate into non - perturbative amplitudes in the dual one , and world - sheet instantons turn into semi - classical configurations of euclidean branes wrapped on non - trivial cycles of the target space .    on the other hand , non - perturbative _ symmetries _ identify different points in the moduli space and hold for any amplitude .",
    "the prototypical example is the @xmath4 s - duality symmetry of ten - dimensional type iib theory , which was used to obtain the exact four - graviton @xmath5 amplitude as the weight @xmath6 @xmath4 eisenstein series @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the einstein - frame inverse tension of a @xmath9 string , and @xmath10 the complex modulus in the upper half plane .",
    "this result follows from supersymmetry constraints and s - duality invariance @xcite .",
    "the weak coupling expansion reproduces the tree - level and one - loop contributions , implies perturbative non - renormalization beyond one - loop , and exhibits a sum of d - instanton effects .",
    "more generally , exact amplitudes should be given by ( non - holomorphic ) automorphic forms of the symmetry group , selected on the basis of the leading perturbative behaviour and supersymmetric constraints @xcite . from a study of this and other exact results",
    ", one may hope to infer the rules of instanton calculus in string theory@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to extend these considerations to the lower - dimensional case of m - theory compactified on a torus @xmath11 , where the symmetry gets enlarged to the u - duality group @xmath1 @xcite , and correspondingly more states come into play .",
    "we first review some basic facts about m - theory and its relation to type iia string theory , then discuss the continuous hidden symmetry @xcite of toroidally compactified 11d supergravity .",
    "only a discrete subgroup of this symmetry may remain as a quantum symmetry of m - theory , and we show how this u - duality follows from t - duality and 11d diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "we first focus on a set of weyl generators of these groups , and derive how the bps spectrum falls into representations thereof @xcite .",
    "borel generators are then included to obtain duality invariant mass formulae . finally , we use the connection between m - theory in discrete light - cone quantization and matrix gauge theories @xcite to uncover the spectrum of the latter theories , and discuss the realization of u - duality in these non - gravitational theories .",
    "this talk is a shortened version of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which the reader is referred for a more extensive discussion and list of references .",
    "m - theory was originally introduced @xcite as the strong coupling limit of type iia string theory .",
    "it reduces to 11d supergravity at low energies , and is conjectured to exhibit eleven - dimensional n=1 super poincar invariance . in particular , m - theory compactified on a circle @xmath12 of radius @xmath13 gives type iia string theory with @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the 11d planck length , and @xmath3 and @xmath16 the string coupling and length .",
    "indeed , one observes that at strong coupling @xmath17 the eleventh direction decompactifies .",
    "the massless spectrum of type iia string theory gets unified in the 11d setting as @xmath18 in terms of the m - theory graviton and antisymmetric three - form and the nsns fields @xmath19 and rr gauge potentials @xmath20 of type iia string theory ( the lower index denotes the number of antisymmetric indices ) ; so do the half - bps states , charged under these fields : @xmath21 here the first ( resp .",
    "second ) entry in each parentheses corresponds to longitudinal ( resp .",
    "transverse ) reduction with respect to the eleventh direction .",
    "this identification can be most easily seen from the mass or tension of the m - theory bps states , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 for the kaluza - klein momentum state , m2 and m5 brane , and kk6-brane ( or taub - nut monopole ) , using the relations in ( [ matching ] ) . as a side remark ,",
    "the kk6-brane may also be reduced along a non - compact direction of the taub - nut space , giving rise to a state with tension proportional to @xmath26 and a logarithmically divergent geometry at infinity ( first reference in @xcite ) .",
    "as we shall see , u - duality predicts many more such states with exotic tensions @xmath27 for compactification to @xmath28 dimensions @xcite .    upon compactification on a torus @xmath29 ,",
    "11d sugra exhibits a group of continuous global symmetry @xmath30 , as well as a ( composite ) gauge invariance under its r - symmetry maximal compact subgroup @xmath31 , as listed in table 1  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry can be seen among the scalar fields , which take value in the symmetric space @xmath32 .",
    "the local @xmath31-invariance can be gauge - fixed thanks to the iwasawa decomposition @xmath33 into maximal compact @xmath31 , abelian @xmath34 and nilpotent @xmath35 subgroups .",
    "a natural gauge is obtained by taking @xmath36 , so that the moduli can be represented as a vielbein : @xmath37 or equivalently as a @xmath31-invariant matrix @xmath38 . in this representation , the abelian factor @xmath34 is parametrized by the radii @xmath39 of the internal torus , while the nilpotent factor @xmath35 incorporates the expectation values of the off - diagonal components of the metric and of the gauge potentials @xmath40 on the torus , as well as their poincar - dual @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath43 acts on the right on the coset @xmath32 , and induces a compensating moduli - dependent @xmath31-rotation to preserve the gauge @xmath36 .",
    "the massless spectrum also includes a number of @xmath44-forms , given for @xmath45 in the last two columns of table 1 , where dualization into forms of lower degree has been carried out .",
    "they transform linearly under @xmath30 and induce charges for particles ( @xmath46 ) and strings ( @xmath47 ) respectively . those are linearly related to the central charges in the @xmath48 supersymmetry algebra by @xmath49 , so that the invariant quadratic form @xmath50 is precisely the invariant mass for half - bps states ( quarter - bps states receive further corrections ) .

    "next , we wish to include the borel generators , corresponding to the right action of nilpotent matrices @xmath35 in the iwasawa decomposition ( [ iwa ] ) , in order to derive duality invariant mass formulae . in the case of t - duality ,",
    "the borel generators include dehn twists from the mapping class group @xmath52 , acting on the homology lattice as @xmath53 , as well as the spectral flow of the b - field : @xmath54 using the @xmath55 boosts , a kk state with momentum 1 can be related to a state with any integer momentum @xmath56 along the circles of @xmath11 with mass @xmath57 . more generally , using ( [ tbor ] )",
    ", the vector representation of the weyl group of t - duality becomes a lattice of kk and winding charges @xmath58 with mass @xmath59 subject to the half - bps condition @xmath60 . for",
    "quarter - bps states the mass formula receives an extra contribution proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , the d - particle states ( completely wrapped d - branes ) with masses @xmath62,@xmath63 , @xmath64 turn into a lattice of integer d0,d2,d4-charges @xmath65 transforming as spinor of @xmath0 .",
    "a careful analysis of the borel generators then gives the half - bps mass @xmath66\\ ] ] where the @xmath67 are the dressed charges @xmath68 , with an extra contribution when the half - bps conditions , @xmath69 } + m~m^{ijkl } = 0 $ ] for @xmath70 , are not fulfilled .",
    "these bps mass formulae can also be obtained by analyzing the born - infeld action @xcite .    in the case of the u - duality group ,",
    "the borel generators include the usual dehn twists @xmath71 in @xmath52 as well as the @xmath72 shifts in @xmath73 , which can be conjugated into @xmath74 . when @xmath75 we also need to include shifts of the dual gauge fields @xmath76",
    ". the u - duality invariant mass formula on tori with arbitrary gauge backgrounds can then again be obtained by considering the non - commuting @xmath40 , @xmath42 and @xmath41 flows . in @xmath77",
    ", we obtain the result @xmath78 where the dressed charges are given by @xmath79 it turns out that the half - bps condition on the particle multiplet transforms as the string multiplet constructed out of the particle charges @xcite , which also follows on dimensional grounds : @xmath80 when these composite charges do not vanish , the state is at most quarter - bps , in which case its mass formula reads @xmath81 ^ 2 }   $ ] with @xmath82 the half - bps tension formula for the string multiplet and @xmath83 the quadratic charges in ( [ cons ] ) .",
    "finally , we wish to use the information on u - duality and invariant mass formulae obtained above to obtain a better understanding of the degrees of freedom and symmetries of matrix gauge theory . according to this prescription @xcite the dlcq of m - theory on a lightlike circle @xmath12 ( radius @xmath84 ) times @xmath11 in the sector with @xmath85",
    "is described by a supersymmetric @xmath86 gauge theory in @xmath87 dimensions on the maximal t - dual torus @xmath88 . in this description",
    "the kk state of the particle multiplet bound to @xmath35 d0-branes becomes ( after maximal t - duality ) a string wound on @xmath35 d@xmath89-branes with ym energy @xmath90 describing a half - bps state carrying electric flux . on the other hand ,",
    "a wrapped membrane of the string multiplet bound to @xmath35 d0-branes becomes a kk state bound to @xmath35 d@xmath89-branes with energy @xmath91 describing a massless excitation .",
    "more generally , the u - duality invariant gauge theory masses can be computed as @xmath92 as an example , the last column of table 2 gives the corresponding gauge theory masses corresponding to the particle multiplet of @xmath51 .",
    "the first state is the state carrying electric flux mentioned above , while the second state carries magnetic flux , and corresponds in general to a d@xmath89-d@xmath93 bound state . in the case of the string multiplet ,",
    "the details of which we omit here , the first states are the kk excitations , and the second is a ym instanton in 3 + 1 dimensions lifted to @xmath94 dimensions , corresponding to d@xmath89-d@xmath95 bound states . starting on @xmath96 , we see the occurrence of states with energy @xmath97 whose interpretation is problematic in pure yang - mills terms .",
    "we can make a more precise comparison of the u - duality invariant masses with the proposed quantum descriptions for @xmath98 . in the first case the d3-brane description is valid so that we have n=4 supersymmetric gauge theory in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the u - duality symmetry @xmath99 corresponds to the mapping class group of the three - torus together with the s - duality symmetry of the gauge theory @xcite . in particular , the m - theory or type iib modular parameter @xmath100 is equated to @xmath101 , so that the m - theory gauge potential @xmath102 translates as a @xmath103 angle in the gauge theory .",
    "for @xmath70 the quantum theory is the ( 2,0 ) worldvolume theory on the m5-brane , where the extra dimension ( d4 @xmath104 m5 ) is generated by identifying @xmath105 .",
    "the @xmath106 u - duality symmetry is now naturally interpreted as the symmetry of m5 on the five - torus , and indeed from the invariant masses we can infer directly that @xmath107 appears as the kk gauge field on @xmath108 .",
    "finally , for @xmath109 the quantum theory is the non - critical string theory living on the ns5-brane ( obtained by type iib s - duality from the d5-brane ) with string length @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath111 u - duality symmetry is now interpreted as the t - duality symmetry of the string theory , and from the invariant masses we infer that @xmath112 is the @xmath113-field of string theory on ns5-brane . for @xmath114 gravity does no longer decouple anymore .",
    "these conclusions can also be reached from the born - infeld action in the scaling limit @xcite . finally , we mention that the string and particle multiplet of @xmath1 , together with the momentum @xmath35 and some additional charges , make a string multiplet representation of @xmath115 , as should be the case if the dlcq proposal is correct @xcite",
