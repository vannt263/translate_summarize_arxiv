    "the waveguide structure fabricated from the two closely placed waveguides is of common use in the fiber and integrated optics .",
    "coupling between the waveguides is due to tunnel penetration of light from one waveguide into another waveguide @xcite .",
    "this coupler preserves direction of light propagation , and for this reason it is named a directed coupler .",
    "it was found @xcite that the steady state pair of electromagnetic pulses can exist in the extended directed coupler or twin - core fibers @xcite .",
    "sometimes it termes soliton .",
    "there is a large body of publications devoted to investigation of the soliton generation and its propagation , see for example @xcite .",
    "recent progress in nanofabrication has lead to the design of new materials with highly unusual optical properties @xcite , of which__negative refraction _",
    "_ is an example .",
    "negative refraction occurs in media in which the wave vector of the electromagnetic wave is antiparallel to the poynting vector @xcite . in the particular case",
    "when the real parts of the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the medium simultaneously take on negative values in some frequency range , the property of negative refraction will appear .",
    "the existence of such media was demonstrated experimentally first in the microwave and then in the near - infrared ranges @xcite .",
    "negative refraction can be realized for the media with spatial dispersion @xcite which is large enough and in the photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "recently bulk metamaterials that show negative refraction for all incident angles in the visible region were presented @xcite .",
    "the unusual properties of negative refractive ( nr ) index materials reveal themselves most prominently when the refractive index of the same medium can be positive in one spectral region and negative in another @xcite .",
    "new wave propagation phenomena can also be expected when a wave passes through , or is localized near , an interface between such a material and a conventional dielectric , i.e. , positive refractive ( pr ) index material @xcite .",
    "we can refer to these cases as _ negative - positive refraction _ ones .",
    "the intriguing example of the negative - positive refraction medium is the coupler , where one of the waveguides is fabricated from a material with a negative refractive index .",
    "this device acts as a ( distributed ) mirror .",
    "the radiation entering one waveguide leaves the device through the other waveguide at the same end but in the opposite direction .",
    "for this reason , this device can be called a _",
    "oppositely - directed coupler _ ( odc ) .",
    "the odc is known to support the propagation of linear waves with a gap in their spectrum ( forbidden zone ) .",
    "it has been shown recently  @xcite that due to this gap the _ nonlinear _ oppositely directed coupler is bistable .",
    "bistability results from the multi - valued dependence of the transmission coefficient on the input - wave power .",
    "it is noteworthy that this effect has no analogy in conventional directed couplers consisting of uniform waveguides without a mirror - based feedback mechanism .",
    "it was found @xcite that if the waveguide nonlinear optical properties are characterized by the third order susceptibility , a coupled pair of the steady state pulses ( each one is localized in its own waveguide ) can exist in odc .",
    "the fabrication of the transparent nonlinear nr waveguide is a complicated and still unresolved problem .",
    "the linear nr waveguide could be more suitable for realization .",
    "however there is question is it possible a quasisolitonic regime for the waves in such a _ antisymmetric _ coupler consisting of a nonlinear conventional dielectric waveguide coupled with a linear nr waveguide . in this paper",
    "we consider the extended asymmetric oppositely - directed coupler ( aodc ) .",
    "we found the steady state solutions of the equations which describe the waves in the aodc .",
    "the numerical simulation of these steady state pulses formation and the collisions between the quasisolitons is performed .",
    "we found that the pulses are very robust against perturbations .",
    "it allows a definite conclusion that the steady state pulses are a new kind of gap solitons .",
    "it should be noted that this solitary wave exists in the medium without grating . the influence of linear losses in the nr waveguide on the quasisoliton formation discussed shortly .",
    "we consider the waveguide structure in which one of the channels is made from nonlinear material features by the positive refraction , and the nr channel is composed of linear material .",
    "the system of the equations based on connected wave approximation takes the form @xmath0 the coefficient @xmath1 is the effective non - linear susceptibility of the first channel . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the coupling constants .",
    "linear properties of the pr channel defined by dielectric permittivity @xmath4 and magnetic permeability @xmath5 .",
    "these values are assumed be real , that corresponds to the lossless materials .",
    "slowly varying envelope of the electric field @xmath6 in @xmath7-th channel is written as @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the group - velocity of the wave in @xmath7-th channel , @xmath10 . here",
    "we assume that the group - velocity dispersion can be neglected . in the following",
    "we also assume that the synchronism condition is satisfied : @xmath11 .",
    "it is convenient to use new normalized variable @xmath12 in the normalized variables the ultimate system of equations ( [ eq1 m ] ) for the aodc reads as    @xmath13    the parameter of nonlinearity is @xmath14    let us consider the linear wave limit of the aods equations",
    ". from ( [ eq2 ] ) one can get @xmath15 if we take the fourier transformation @xmath16 the equations ( [ eq2lin ] ) result in the following linear system of equation @xmath17 this system of equations has the nonzero solution only if the corresponding determinant @xmath18 is equal to zero .",
    "that leads to the dispersion relation @xmath19 thus the spectrum of the linear waves has the gap @xmath20 .",
    "this gap is characteristic feature for a distributed mirror @xcite .",
    "hence , the aodc in linear wave limit acts as a mirror .    in following consideration",
    "it is suitable to take the real variables form of equations ( [ eq2 ] ) . by using the real variables",
    "@xmath21 one obtains @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 . from the amplitude equation",
    "it follows that @xmath26 hence , @xmath27 in the case of solitary waves , for which the electromagnetic fields vanish at infinity are considered , the right part of ( [ eq4 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "it leads to integral of motion @xmath28 it is the modified manley - rowe relation .",
    "as usually , in the case of the quadratic nonlinear pr media manley - rowe relation looks like @xmath29 the difference of the expression ( [ intmot ] ) from conventional manley - rowe relation is explained by the fact that the energy flux for the waves in one waveguide opposite in direction to energy flux of other waveguide , while their wave vectors are approximately the same .",
    "this flux pattern is an inherent feature of the negative - positive refraction media .",
    "to consider the solitary steady state waves in aodc by similar way as in @xcite we have start from the equations ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "suppose that solutions of these equations are depend only on single variable @xmath30 with free parameter @xmath31 .",
    "suppose @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the system of the equations ( [ eq3 ] ) takes the following form @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 we can also write an equation for the phase difference @xmath37 the phase equations can be used to get one equation for the phase difference .",
    "finally , the total system of equations reads @xmath38    we are looking for a solution in a form of the solitary wave , it corresponds with the following boundary condition @xmath39 from the equation ( [ eq7a ] ) and ( [ eq7b ] ) it follows @xmath40 , or @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the system of equations ( [ eq7a])-([eq7c ] ) is reduced to following pare of equations @xmath43 multiplying the last equation by @xmath44 and taking into account the equation ( [ eq8a ] ) , we get the second integral of motion @xmath45 due to the boundary condition , the value of this integral is equal to zero .",
    "as we are looking for a non zero solution of ( [ eq8a ] ) and ( [ eq8b ] ) , one can write @xmath46 substitution of ( [ eq10 ] ) into ( [ eq8a ] ) leads to @xmath47 choosing the variable @xmath48 reduces this expression into equation @xmath49 which has the following solution @xmath50 thus , the solution of ( [ eq8a ] ) and ( [ eq8b ] ) is @xmath51 by using the phase s equations and ( [ eq11 ] ) one can write @xmath52 @xmath53 that yields @xmath54    the phases @xmath55 should be chosen in such a way that ( [ eq10 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "as the solitary wave s amplitude tends to zero @xmath56 , the relation ( [ eq10 ] ) at infinity reduces to @xmath57 in the numerical simulation we choose @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath60 are defined by the following expressions @xmath61    the expressions ( [ eq13a ] ) and ( [ eq13b ] ) describe the steady state solitary wave propagating in aodc under consideration .",
    "this wave looks like a gap soliton propagating in the nonlinear bragg grating , however there are no any periodic structures .",
    "gap in the linear wave spectrum ( [ disprel ] ) is due to the flux pattern in this negative - positive refraction media .",
    "some remarks are worthy to be made about the free parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the negative value of the parameter @xmath31 corresponds to the solitary wave propagating in the direction of the axis @xmath62 . the solitary wave characterized by positive value of the parameter @xmath31 propagates in the opposite direction .",
    "the large amplitudes ( more powerful solitary waves ) correspond to large positive values of the parameter @xmath31 . for the negative values of the parameter",
    "@xmath31 the quasisolitons with smaller amplitudes have smaller values of the parameter @xmath31 however the absolute value of the velocity determined by the parameter @xmath31 is larger for the less powerful solitary waves",
    ". we will refer to the fig.[fig1 ] later in discussion the influence of the linear losses at the quasisoliton .",
    "it is common knowledge that the completely integrable evolution nonlinear equations have a special solutions describing elastic interaction of solitary waves @xcite .",
    "these waves are named solitons .",
    "it is our opinion that the system of equations ( [ eq2 ] ) does not belong to the class of completely integrable equations .",
    "hence the solution of these equations does not represent true soliton .",
    "we will denote them as quasisolitons . to investigate interaction between the steady state solitary waves ( [ eq13a ] ) and ( [ eq13b ] )",
    "the numerical simulation was pursued .    numerical solution of the system of equations ( [ eq2 ] ) is performed using the scheme of the finite differences .",
    "the conservation of the first integral of motion ( [ intmot ] ) is used to control the computational error . in the consequent an integration step over the evolution variable @xmath63",
    "is set to @xmath64 .",
    "the nonlinearity is set to @xmath65 .",
    "( the smaller nonlinearities correspond to the quasisolitons with the same profiles but the smaller amplitudes ( defined by the parameter @xmath66 which is linearly proportional to the nonlinearity coefficient . )",
    "it was found that the results of the collision depend on the relative velocity of the pulses .",
    "fig.[m05m09 ] illustrates collision between quasisolitons characterized by @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the relative interaction velocity is @xmath69 .",
    "the quasisolitons drop some radiation after interaction and weakly radiating wave could be noticed in the left panel of the picture as a result of collision .",
    "velocities and the amplitudes of the resulting quasisolitons are slightly different from the parameters of the quasisolitons before the collision due to loss of some part of energy .",
    "decrease the difference between velocities of colliding pulses results in long - range interaction between pulses .",
    "the interaction distance depends on the relation of the velocities . in the fig.[m05m07 ] is shown interaction of two quasisolitons characterized by @xmath70 and @xmath68 .",
    "the relative interaction velocity is @xmath71 .",
    "the quasisolitons exchange energy at the distance and form a transitory bound state .",
    "it was mentioned before that the quasisolitions with the same absolute values of velocity have different amplitudes . to investigate the robustness of the quasisoliton depending on its energy , at the fig.[m05m07 ] we present results of modeling the collision between two steady - state solitary waves with the same absolute values of the velocity @xmath72 and @xmath70 .",
    "a more energetic quasisoliton with @xmath72 remains unchanged after collision and the less energetic quasisoliton with @xmath70 loose some radiation and changes its trajectory .    thus , the collision of two steady state pulses with different velocities has shown significant robustness .",
    "small amplitude radiation appearing after collision attests that the quasisoliton eventually be disappeared .",
    "for the current state of fabrication technology the losses in the real nr materials are considerable .",
    "high value of losses renders steady state pulse propagation impossible .",
    "nevertheless , the role of small losses would be considered . to check the influence of linear losses in the nr channel on the solitary wave formation and propagation , the model equations ( [ eq2 ] ) were modified by including the additional term in the equation for a nr channel @xmath73    the fig.[07m07dec ] illustrates the evolution of same pulses as in the fig.[07m07 ] placed at the boundaries however the linear losses in the nr channel are taken into consideration @xmath74 . comparing these two pictures",
    "one may conclude that even small losses affect considerably the propagation properties of the solitary waves . propagating in the dissipative medium these pulses loose energy and the pulse with positive",
    "@xmath31 slows down to sustain the steady state regime .",
    "the pulse with negative @xmath31 slightly accelerates to support the quasi - steady regime of propagation ( notice a fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we considered the nonlinear solitary waves propagating in the nonlinear opposite - directed coupler .",
    "one of its components is a nonlinear waveguide made from the material with positive index of refraction .",
    "another channel is fabricated from linear dielectric material with negative refraction index .",
    "for the system of coupled waves the analytical solution for the electromagnetic waves in the form of steady state solitary waves is found .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the wave in the nonlinear channel affects the wave propagation in the neighboring linear channel .",
    "this influence results in coupling and a steady propagation of the solitary waves in both waveguides , the wave in the nonlinear waveguide draws the wave in the linear nr waveguide .",
    "it was shown that the result of interaction of the quasisolitons depends on their velocities .",
    "provided that relative velocity of the two colliding quasisolitons is large , the pulses collide almost like the solitions . a weak radiation or a weak pulse emerges as a result of collision .",
    "at small relative velocities of the quasisolitons the interaction between two colliding solitary waves could results in a strong energy exchange between colliding solitary waves and formation of the temporarily coupled state of the interacting quasisolitons .",
    "this phenomena is known for the case of nonlinear directed coupling . in the case under consideration the formation of the coupled state demands for an additional investigation .",
    "it could be possible that a long - living coupled state of two solitary waves is exists there .",
    "the influence of the linear losses in the nr waveguide on the existence of the solitary waves was studied .",
    "the wave loses its energy as it propagates through the dissipative medium . in order to compensate the losses the entering pulse in a form of the solitary wave characterized by positive value of parameter @xmath31 (",
    "its propagation direction is opposite to the coordinate axis @xmath62 ) permanently transforms into another solitary wave , less energetic , having smaller value of the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "it results in slowing down the wave in the lossy medium .",
    "after that the wave stops in the waveguide and changes the direction of its propagation .",
    "oppositely the entering pulse in a form of the solitary wave characterized by negative parameter @xmath31 ( its propagation direction is coincides to the coordinate axis @xmath62 ) tends to increase its velocity ( i.e. to decrease parameter @xmath31 which is negative ) to sustain the steady - state regime of propagation in presence of the losses .",
