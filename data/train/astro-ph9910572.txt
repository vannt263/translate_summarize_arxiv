    "in 1988 , lynden - bell & lahav for the first time prepared a `` whole - sky '' distribution of the extragalactic light to map the density enhancements in the local universe , to compare them to cosmic flow fields and to determine the gravity field on the local group . assuming that light traces mass , this could be realized through a diameter - coded distribution of galaxies larger than @xmath7 taken from the following galaxy catalogs : the uppsala general catalog ugc ( nilson 1973 ) for the north ( @xmath8 ) , the eso uppsala catalog ( lauberts 1982 ) for the south ( @xmath9 ) , while the missing strip ( @xmath10 ) was filled with data from the morphological catalog of galaxies mcg ( vorontsov - velyaminov & archipova 1963 - 74 ) .    because these optical galaxy catalogs are limited to the largest galaxies they become increasingly incomplete close to the galactic equator where the dust thickens , reducing the apparent diameters of the galaxies . added to this",
    "are the growing number of foreground stars which fully or partially block the view of galaxy images .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ait ] , where such a light distribution is presented in an aitoff equal - area projection centered on the galactic plane .",
    "the same corrections as advocated in lahav ( 1987 ) have been applied to homogenize the data of the three different galaxy catalogs , i.e.  @xmath11 and @xmath12 . a cut - off at @xmath13",
    "was imposed  the completeness limit of the respective catalogs according to hudson & lynden - bell ( 1991 ) .    fig .",
    "[ ait ] clearly displays the irregularity in the distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe with its dynamically important density enhancements such as the local supercluster visible as a circle ( the supergalactic plane ) centered on the virgo cluster at @xmath14 , the perseus - pisces chain bending into the zoa at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the general overdensity in the cosmic microwave background dipole direction ( @xmath17 , kogut etal .",

    "most conspicuous in this distribution is , however , the very broad , nearly empty band of about 20@xmath23 : the zone of avoidance . comparing this band with the 100  dust extinction maps of the dirbe experiment ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) we found that the zoa  the area where our galaxy counts are severely incomplete  is described almost perfectly by the extinction contour @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 , cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "systematic deeper searches for `` partially obscured '' galaxies  down to fainter magnitudes and smaller dimensions ( @xmath26 ) than existing catalogs  have been performed with the aim to reduce this zoa . using",
    "existing sky surveys ( poss i and poss ii in the north and the eso / serc surveys in the south ) , the whole zoa has in the mean time been visually surveyed for galaxies . here ,",
    "examination by eye is still the best technique .",
    "a separation of galaxy and star images can as yet not be done by automated measuring machines ( e.g.  cosmos or apm ) on a viable basis below @xmath27 though surveys by eye are clearly both very trying and time consuming , and maybe not as objective .",

    "this is considerably deeper than the previously regarded `` whole - sky '' catalogs with their completeness limits of @xmath40 . how can these catalogs be merged to arrive at a well - defined whole - sky galaxy distribution with a reduced zoa ?",
    "in order to merge the various deep optical zoa surveys with existing galaxy catalogs , kraan - korteweg ( 1999 ) and woudt ( 1998 ) have analyzed the completeness of their zoa galaxy catalogs ",

    ", we conclude that our optical zoa surveys are complete to an apparent diameter of @xmath43  where the diameters correspond to an isophote of 24.5  mag / arcsec@xmath44 ( kraan - korteweg 1999 )  for extinction levels less than @xmath45 .",
    "how about the intrinsic diameters , i.e.  the diameters galaxies would have if they were unobscured ?",
    "a spiral galaxy seen through an extinction of @xmath24 will , for example , be reduced to @xmath46 of its unobscured size .",
    "only @xmath47 of a ( spiral ) galaxy s original dimension is seen when it is observed through @xmath48 . in 1990 ,",
    "cameron derived analytical descriptions to correct for the obscuration effects by artificially absorbing the intensity profiles of unobscured galaxies .",
    "these corrections depend quite strongly on morphological type due to the difference in surface brightness profiles and mean surface brightness between early - type galaxies and spiral galaxies . applying these corrections",
    ", we find that at @xmath45 , an obscured spiral or elliptical galaxy at our _ apparent _ completeness limit of @xmath49 would have an intrinsic diameter of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , respectively . at",
    "extinction levels higher than @xmath45 , an elliptical galaxy with @xmath52 would appear smaller than the completeness limit @xmath43 and might have gone unnoticed",
    ". the here discussed optical galaxy catalog should therefore be complete to @xmath53 for galaxies of all morphological types down to extinction levels of @xmath54 with the possible exception of extremely low - surface brightness galaxies . only intrinsically very large and bright galaxies  particularly galaxies with high surface brightness  will be recovered in deeper extinction layers .",
    "this completeness limit could be confirmed by independently analyzing the diameter vs. extinction and the cumulative diameter diagrams for extinction - corrected diameters .",
    "we can thus supplement the eso , ugc and mcg catalogs  which are complete to @xmath55  with galaxies from optical zoa galaxy searches that have @xmath56 and @xmath57 . as our completeness limit lies well above the eso , ugc and mcg catalogs",
    ", we can assume that the other similarly performed optical galaxy searches in the zoa should also be complete to @xmath58 for extinction levels of @xmath54 .    in fig .",
    "[ aitc ] we have then taken the first step in arriving at an improved whole - sky galaxy distribution with a reduced zoa . in this aitoff projection",
    "we have plotted all the ugc , eso , mcg galaxies that have _ extinction - corrected _",
    "diameters @xmath56 ( remember that galaxies adjacent to the optical galaxy search regions are also affected by absorption though to a lesser extent : @xmath59 ) , and added the galaxies from the various optical surveys with @xmath60 and @xmath54 for which positions and diameters were available . the regions for which these data are not yet available are marked in fig .",
    "[ aitc ] . as some searches were performed on older generation poss i plates , which are less deep compared to the second generation poss ii and eso / serc plates ,",
    "an additional correction was applied to those diameters , i.e.  the same correction as for the ugc galaxies which also are based on poss i survey material ( @xmath61 ) .    a comparison of fig .  [ ait ] with fig .",
    "[ aitc ] demonstrates convincingly how the deep optical galaxy searches realize a considerable reduction of the zoa ; we can now trace the large - scale structures in the nearby universe to extinction levels of @xmath45 .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ aitc ] reveals that the galaxy density enhancement in the ga region is even more pronounced and a connection of the perseus - pisces chain across the milky way at @xmath16 more likely .",
    "hence , these supplemented whole - sky maps certainly should improve our understanding of the velocity flow fields and the total gravitational attraction on the local group .",
    "redshift follow - ups of well - defined samples of zoa galaxies will be important in analyzing the large - scale structures in redshift - space .",
    "systematic redshift surveys have been performed for various zoa regions and revealed a number of dynamically important structures such as     the rich , massive ( @xmath62 ) cluster a3627 at ( @xmath63 ) which seems to constitute the previously unrecognized but predicted density peak at the bottom of the potential well of the great attractor ( kraan - korteweg etal .",

    ", systematic hi  surveys have proven very powerful as the galaxy is transparent to the 21-cm line radiation of neutral hydrogen and hi - rich galaxies can readily be found through detection of their redshifted 21-cm emission .",
    "in march 1997 , a systematic blind hi  survey began in the most opaque part of the southern milky way ( @xmath66 ; @xmath67 ) with the multibeam ( mb ) receiver ( 13 beams in the focal plane array ) at the 64 m parkes telescope .",
    "the zoa is being surveyed along constant galactic latitudes in 23 contiguous fields of length @xmath68 .",
    "the ultimate goal is 25 scans per field where adjacent strips will be offset in latitude by @xmath69 for homogeneous sampling . with an effective integration time of 25 min / beam we obtain a 3@xmath70 detection limit of 25mjy .",
    "the survey covers a velocity range of @xmath71 with a channel spacing of 13.2  per channel , and will be sensitive to normal spiral galaxies well beyond the great attractor region .",
    "so far , a shallow survey based on 2 out of the foreseen 25 driftscan passages has been analyzed ( cf .",

    "107 galaxies were catalogued with peak hi - flux densities of @xmath7280  mjy ( @xmath73  mjy after hanning smoothing ) and their detection show no dependence on galactic latitude , nor the amount of foreground obscuration through which they have been detected .",
    "four cubes centered on the great attractor region ( @xmath74 , @xmath3 ) of the full - sensitivity survey have been analyzed ( juraszek etal .",
    "1999 ) and uncovered 236 galaxies above the @xmath75 detection level of 25  mjy .",
    "70% of the detections had no previous identification .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ mbga ] , a sky distribution centered on the ga region displays all galaxies with redshifts @xmath76  .",
    "next to redshifts from the literature ( circles ; leda ) , redshifts from the follow - up observations of kraan - korteweg and collaborators in the hy / ant - crux - ga zoa surveys ( dashed area ) are plotted .",

    "adding now the new detections from the systematic blind hi  mb - zoa survey ( box ) , we for the first time can trace structures all the way across the milky way .",
    "the new picture seems to suggest that the ga overdensity is a `` great - wall '' like structure starting at the pavo cluster , having its core at the a3627 cluster and then bending over towards shorter longitudes across the zoa .",
    "this becomes even clearer in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mbga ] where the galaxies are displayed in a redshift cone out to @xmath76  for the longitude range @xmath2 analyzed so far of the mb full - sensitivity data .",
    "the a3627 cluster is clearly the most massive galaxy cluster uncovered by the various surveys in the ga region and therefore the most likely candidate for the previously unidentified but predicted density - peak at the bottom of the potential well of the ga overdensity .    finding a hitherto uncharted further cluster of galaxies at the heart of the ga would have serious implications for our current understanding of this massive overdensity in the local universe .",
    "various indications suggest that pks1343 - 601 , the second brightest extragalactic radio source in the southern sky ( @xmath79  jy , mcadam 1991 ) , might form the center of yet another highly obscured rich cluster , particularly as it also shows significant x - ray emission ( cf.kraan-korteweg & woudt 1999 for further details ) . at ( @xmath80 ,",
    "this radio galaxy lies behind an obscuration layer of about 12 magnitudes of extinction in the b - band , hence optical surveys are ineffective . still , west & tarenghi ( 1989 ) observed this source and identified it  with an extinction - corrected diameter of @xmath81 and a recession velocity of v = 3872   as a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "giant ellipticals generally reside at the cores of clusters .",
    "interestingly enough , the hi  mb survey does uncover a significant excess of galaxies at this position in velocity space ( cf .  fig .  [ mbga ] ) . however , we do not see a `` finger of god '' , the characteristic signature of a cluster in redshift space .",
    "could it be that too many central cluster galaxies are missed by the hi  observations because spiral galaxies generally avoid the cores of clusters ?",
    "the existence of this possible cluster still remains a mystery .",
    "meanwhile , this prospective cluster has been imaged in the near infrared ( woudt etal .  in progress ) , where extinction effects are less severe compared to the optical , and which should uncover early - type cluster members if they are there .",
