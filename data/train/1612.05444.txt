    "the traditional goal of non - imaging light concentrators ( lcs ) has always been to maximize the collected light ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is particularly true for detectors with a limited ( @xmath0 30% ) geometrical coverage , such as sno , ctf , borexino , etc .",
    "moreover , in a liquid based detector the amount of collected light depends on the vertex position , due to light absorption and scattering . by limiting the field of view of the pmt , lcs",
    "reduce the amount of collected light for events at large radii , thus helping to increase the energy reconstruction uniformity . in detectors as juno and reno-50 , planning very high geometrical coverages ( around 70% ) , lc remains a valid tool also against another non - homogeneity effect .",
    "actually , in large pmts the photoelectron ( p.e . ) detection efficiency ( de ) is uneven throughout their surface - the pmt edge being the worst - performing region .",
    "the dispersive effects induced by such a non - homogeneous de affect the total number of collected p.e .",
    ", worsening significantly the detector - level energy resolution when compared to the intrinsic stochastic component .",
    "standard lcs can become occulting light concentrator ( olc ) with the aim of reducing pmt - related dispersive effects while maximizing light collection and making the detector response more uniform .",
    "an ideal two - dimensional compound tangential concentrator ( ctc ) is designed in order to transmit to the photocathode all the light incident at the entrance aperture with an angle @xmath1 and to avoid the transmission of all the light with incident angle @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is a ctc construction parameter and defines the maximum accepted incident photon angle . in 3d , where the ctc is obtained by rotating the 2d profile around the symmetry axis ,",
    "the perfect performances in light transmission are slightly degraded for angles @xmath1 .",
    "we call @xmath4 the incident angle where this degradation starts and @xmath5 the maximal photon incident angle at the pmt level ( see figure [ fig : fv ] ) .",
    "we consider two extreme configurations : olc@xmath6 , obtained by requiring @xmath7 and olc@xmath8 , by requiring @xmath9 .",

    "we consider 12 possible ce profiles as a function of the distance from the pmt axis ( @xmath12 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : ce_studies ] ( left ) .",
    "a non - flat ce profile acts on the detector resolution by reducing the number of detected photons ( increasing the stochastic resolution ) , as clearly shown by blue dots in central panel of figure [ fig : ce_studies ] .",
    "moreover , it introduces a dependence on the event vertex position , resulting in an additional non - stochastic resolution term , as show in the right panel of figure [ fig : ce_studies ] ( cf .",
    "empty and filled dots ) .",
    "olc focuses the light meant to hit the external crown of the photocathode ( large @xmath13 , close to the pmt equator ) towards the central region of the photocathode , effectively mitigating the dispersive behaviour of the ce profiles .",
    "this is shown again in the central and right panel of figure [ fig : ce_studies ] for olc@xmath6 ( orange ) and olc@xmath8 ( green ) .",
    "plots in figure [ fig : ce_studies ] are obtained by applying a radial non - uniformity correction ; we assume either perfect knowledge of ce profiles ( filled dots ) or flat ce ( empty dots ) .",
    "for ce profiles up to number 7 , olcs clearly improve the energy resolution .",
    "results are comparable with those obtained by full knowledge of ce profile .",
    "thanks to its tallest shape , olc@xmath6 not only collects more light in the case of a flat ce , but it also manages to have the best light collection across all the ce models .",
    "however , in terms of energy resolution , olc@xmath8 has better performance than olc@xmath6 also for extreme ce profiles , due to its peculiar acceptance curve .",

    "the main goal of juno is to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy by measuring the energy spectrum of @xmath14 coming from nuclear reactors at 52  km far from the detector . to achieve this goal ,",
    "an unprecedented 3% energy resolution at 1mev is required .",
    "the juno collaboration is presently considering to implement olcs in the detector design , in order to : ( 1 ) occult the pmt edge , where the ce decreases ; ( 2 ) improve the uniformity in the light collection across the detector ; ( 3 ) recover good light in case the total number of pmts has to be reduced . the ce profile has been measured on a sub - sample of juno pmts .",
    "the analytical behavior as a function of @xmath12 is reported in figure [ fig : juno ] ( left ) , showing an almost constant ce up to @xmath15 24 cm .",
    "the olc profile has thus been tailored on juno pmt , via the ctc method , in order to occult the photocathode area at @xmath16 24 cm , for r@xmath17 17.2 m , r@xmath18 19.5 m and by asking @xmath7 .",
    "since the complete ctc shape does not fit juno geometrical constraints , it must be cut in order to avoid overlapping with near - by olcs , as shown in figure [ fig : juno ] ( middle ) .",
    "the reference clearance between two pmts is 25 mm . due to mechanical constraints ,",
    "larger clearances are begin considered .",
    "to increase the clearance also means to reduce the total number of pmts .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : juno ] ( right ) , olcs help to recover light when increasing the clearance .",
    "moreover , the light collection becomes more uniform across the detector volume .",
    "thanks to their occulting action and to the uniformity in the light detection , also the energy resolution improves . in particular , when requiring a larger clearance , olc allow to recover the energy resolution level of the standard configuration ( no - olc and 25 mm clearance ) , thus avoiding any degradation in the energy reconstruction .",
