    "the existence and location of a critical end point ( cep ) on the qcd phase diagram is an issue of active debate in the theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite physics community .",
    "perturbation theory tells us that at sufficiently high temperatures qcd matter exists in a deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase @xcite .",
    "since we are well familiar with the low temperature hadronic matter phase @xcite , at some point on the @xmath1 plane a phase transition or at least a crossover must occur .",
    "the story is as follows , which begins with fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdphasediagram ] : a plausible sketch of the qcd phase diagram for physical values of strange , up and down quark masses .",
    "the generic features are a first order phase boundary that terminates at a cep @xmath2 , and a crossover between the qgp and hadronic phases at @xmath0 . a brief remark about the notation : @xmath3 refers to the temperature at the cep , while @xmath4 denotes the qcd crossover temperature at @xmath0 .    a first order phase boundary that terminates at a cep is known to exist for exactly solvable random matrix models that have the same symmetries as qcd @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the data that we have obtained from lattice qcd @xcite suggests that we should expect to see a crossover to the qgp along the @xmath0 axis at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to test these predictions experimentally , hence determining the exact layout of the qcd phase diagram remains an open problem .    for instance , in place of fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdphasediagram ] , we may have a phase diagram with a first order curve that continues all the way to the @xmath0 axis . or , alternatively , a first order phase boundary and cep may simply not even exist .",
    "it is known theoretically @xcite that the transition ( whether it be first order , second order or simply a crossover ) to the qgp at @xmath0 is heavily dependent upon , amongst other things , the strange quark mass @xmath6 .",
    "assuming that the qcd phase diagram is that as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdphasediagram ] , then it would be of great interest to make a theoretical prediction about the location of the cep . in principle , this can be achieved via lattice qcd by a monte carlo sampling of the qcd partition function @xmath7 however , it is well known that at non - zero chemical potential one encounters the notorious fermion sign problem .    in spite of this limitation ,",
    "the location of the cep may still be potentially determined by lattice methods @xcite if one performs a taylor expansion of thermodynamic variables about @xmath8 ( or more generally , @xmath9 ) .",
    "since all of the taylor coefficients are evaluated at zero or purely imaginary @xmath10 , there is no fermion sign problem .",
    "since thermodynamic variables ( pressure and its derivatives for instance ) are non - analytic at the cep , the radius of convergence of such a taylor series specifies the exact distance from the series origin to the nearest non - analytic point .",
    "if this point happens to be on the real @xmath10 axis , one has effectively located the cep .",
    "the main drawback is that in practice , one is only able to compute taylor coefficients up to a specific finite order . locating the cep",
    ", nevertheless , requires knowledge of the full taylor series .",
    "one would hope that it is sufficiently reliable to simply extrapolate from the few knowable lowest order coefficients .",
    "the focus of this work is to test the effectiveness of the taylor series method .",
    "if it has any hope of predicting the location of the cep in qcd , it should at least be able to do so for a much simpler toy model whose second order phase transition is in the same universality class .",
    "we are , of course , talking about the 3d ising model , whose phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isingphasediagram ] .",
    "the 3d ising model is not exactly solvable , but numerical simulations are able to yield high precision estimates of its critical exponents and critical temperature @xmath3 ( unlike for qcd ) .",
    "i.e. , the location of the ising model critical point is _ known_.    looking at fig .  [",
    "fig : us_them ] , the series expansion method in qcd amounts to walking along the @xmath0 axis ( where there is no sign problem ) and computing the taylor coefficients of the quark number susceptibility ( qns ) at more or less evenly spaced intervals of @xmath11 .",
    "it is from these coefficients that one tries to learn about what takes place at non - zero @xmath10 .",
    "the direct analogy , in the ising model , is to walk along some curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : isingphasediagram ] , and compute a similar set of taylor coefficients ( again at roughly even intervals ) . however , since there is no sign problem anywhere on fig .",
    "[ fig : isingphasediagram ] , we are free to pick a convenient shape for this curve . for the sake of simplicity , we will consider the problem of locating the critical point based on correlation functions measured along a line parallel to the @xmath12 axis , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : us_them ] .    having computed the taylor coefficients of the ising model free energy @xmath13 up to some given order , we will then analyze the properties of this truncated taylor series in an attempt to locate the critical point . specifically , since the magnetic susceptibility diverges at the critical point , we are looking for a non - analytic point of @xmath13 . for the ising model ,",
    "this is a very convoluted way of locating the critical point : but that is the point .",
    "we want to test how the extrapolation method works in an example where we can also directly locate the critical endpoint , to check our work .",
    "the point is to mimic what has been done or at least is presently _ doable _ for qcd . due to the ease with",
    "which one can perform statistical simulations of the ising model we are theoretically able to compute the taylor coefficients needed for this analysis up to some very high order , so we are not restricted in this regard . in qcd , this is definitely not the case .",
    "hence , we really only want to go to high enough order to at least address the issue of what is needed to learn _",
    "for an overview of the taylor series method applied to qcd the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a detailed overview of the ising model is given in @xcite .",
    "we will now show how this translates over to the ising model , which , in cartoon form , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : us_them ] . assuming that the qcd free energy is extensive , the thermodynamic pressure is given by    @xmath16    which can be expanded in a dual taylor series in the up / down quark chemical potentials about @xmath17 @xmath18",
    "this series can be reformulated in terms of baryon ( @xmath19 ) and isovector ( @xmath20 ) chemical potentials .",
    "fixing @xmath21 and defining @xmath22 leaves a simplified taylor series in @xmath23 .",
    "the various @xmath24 s have expressions in terms of the expectation values of products of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and its derivatives .",
    "moreover , since the origin of the taylor series is @xmath15 , all of these computations are performed with @xmath27 real and non - negative .    to construct the 3d ising model analogue ,",
    "we begin by defining an @xmath28 lattice @xmath29 as a set of individual spins @xmath30 on a 3d simple cubic lattice with volume @xmath31 and lattice spacing @xmath32 @xmath33 these spins interact via the hamiltonian @xmath34 where the second summation is over all nearest neighbor pairs , and @xmath35 is ferromagnetic . given @xmath36 ,",
    "an expression for the partition function then follows . defining the total spin @xmath37 @xmath38 we have @xmath39 where , as usual , @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the free energy per unit volume is @xmath41 from which we obtain the thermodynamic variables @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are respectively the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "a taylor series for @xmath13 is obtained by simply noting that @xmath45 is a moment generating function , and hence @xmath46 is a cumulant generating function @xcite .",
    "expressions for the various cumulants @xmath47 in terms of the moments @xmath48 can be obtained from the generating function @xmath49 and , for instance , @xmath50 thus , the taylor series for @xmath13 is given by @xmath51 which is an expansion in @xmath52 at fixed @xmath11 .    in summary , the analysis for qcd and the ising model amounts to extrapolating the behavior of the higher order @xmath24 s and the @xmath53 s from those that can be calculated . if a singularity is suspect , its distance from the expansion point is equal to the series radius of convergence . for an arbitrary function @xmath54",
    "expanded in a series @xmath55 the radius of convergence @xmath56 is given formally by @xmath57{|f_n| } } .\\ ] ] in our case , we may infer the radius of convergence from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath58 alternatively , we may also consider the @xmath59 limit of @xmath60 or @xmath61    all of these definitions are effectively equivalent in that they all yield the same @xmath62 limit .",
    "however , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are of relevance to @xcite since the taylor series that they analyze only has even powers of @xmath10 .",
    "this is , however , a minor technicality . in both models , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath65 ( or @xmath63 or @xmath64 )",
    "is inferred from the series few lowest order taylor coefficients .",
    "specifically , the highest order that is achieved for qcd is @xmath66 .",
    "so that we remain on roughly the same footing , we will thus restrict our analysis to @xmath67 coefficients .",
    "monte carlo studies @xcite with lattices up to @xmath68 have revealed the ising critical point to be at @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , and of course we already know that @xmath71 .",
    "what we now want to figure out is whether or not we can infer the location of this critical point by carrying out the expansion described above .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed on 3d simple cubic lattices using the cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we are restricted on the phase diagram to lines of constant background magnetic field strength , denoted by @xmath72 .",
    "we specifically choose to work along the lines of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , since at these distances we are able to obtain good statistics , while remaining in the critical region ( when near @xmath3 ) .",
    "at distances too close to the critical point the correlation length grows rapidly , hence much larger volumes would require consideration .",
    "whereas , if one is too far from the critical point ( @xmath75 , say ) , critical behavior is not observed . for the values of @xmath72 that we considered , it was sufficient to consider sizes in the range @xmath76 .",
    "now that we have chosen the values of @xmath72 around which we will base our analysis , we need to determine the minimal lattice sizes ( for each of our the two different values of @xmath72 ) which sufficiently converge to the thermodynamic limit . due to the divergence of the correlation length at the critical point",
    ", one would expect that obtaining reasonable data for @xmath74 requires a larger ( perhaps significantly ) lattice than for @xmath73 .",
    "such convergence is best observed qualitatively by plotting @xmath77 as a function of @xmath11 over a range of volumes ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h01voldep ] for @xmath73 and fig .",
    "[ fig : h001voldep ] for @xmath74 ) .",
    "these graphs suggest that it is sufficient to work with @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , based on qualitative observation that the thermodynamic `` limit '' is achieved whenever any two subsequent graphs overlap .",
    "more to the point , the thermodynamic limit is effectively reached when the volume dependence of higher order cumulants becomes washed away in statistical uncertainty .",
    "said differently , it becomes impossible to accurately distinguish volume dependence from noise .",
    "this effect is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : k8h01voldep ] and [ fig : k8h001voldep ] for @xmath80 , where it is made very clear for @xmath74 .",
    "the increasing uncertainty eventually renders the analysis inconclusive at sufficiently large volumes .",
    "based on figs .",
    "[ fig : h01voldep ] and [ fig : k8h01voldep ] it may seem a bit overzealous to regard @xmath78 as the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , at the expense of relatively small finite - size volume effects , it turns out to be very statistically advantageous to work with @xmath78 over say @xmath81 ; this is further discussed in the next section .",
    "it should be noted that measurements of the correlation length along our values of @xmath72 ( see appendix a ) further validate the choices of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , since it turns out that these lattices are many correlation lengths across .",
    "henceforth , if we are discussing @xmath82 results it should be assumed that the data originated from an @xmath78 lattice and likewise @xmath79 for @xmath83 , unless it is stated otherwise .",
    "moreover , it should be assumed that any measured quantity is obtained from averaging over @xmath84 uncorrelated samples , with estimates of uncertainty calculated using the jackknife method @xcite .",
    "the results of our analysis are plotted over figs .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] to [ fig : chi45 ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] illustrates the crossover from the magnetized to the unordered phase ( @xmath85 is simply the magnetization per unit volume ) .",
    "the taylor coefficients ( higher order @xmath53 s , normalized to unity ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappaall ] . the taylor series constructed out of these coefficients are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : chi6 ] and [ fig : chi45 ] .",
    "finally , @xmath65 ( from which we extrapolate radii of convergence ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rn ] to [ fig : h001rn ] .",
    "now that the data has been presented , the first thing that we should try to do is infer ( guess ) the location of @xmath3 .",
    "subsequently , we will then calculate @xmath86 and specify the location of the critical point ( assuming that everything goes according to plan ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the ising model are drastically simpler than those of qcd .",
    "that being said , the `` restricted '' extent of our data set is not due to any sort of numerical limitations .",
    "if we truly desired we could easily a ) obtain data from larger sample sizes , b ) sample the temperature axis more frequently and c ) obtain even higher order taylor coefficients .",
    "rather , as discussed in the introduction , we are on purpose trying to somewhat mimic the limitations facing any realistic study of qcd .    in what follows , we will try to apply to same logic in locating the ising critical point as that which has been used for qcd .",
    "therefore , a bit of a synopsis of the analysis in @xcite would be in order .",
    "the authors focus mainly on the taylor expansions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 up to sixth order and @xmath89 , @xmath90 does not necessarily equal @xmath91 ( flavour symmetry only requires @xmath92 ) .",
    "simply , @xmath93 while @xmath94 . ] . by definition ,",
    "expanding in @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and , for instance @xmath99 with similar expressions for the other @xmath100 s .",
    "the critical region is highlighted by the formation of sharp peaks in the @xmath101 s , which are observed in the vicinity of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath102 , @xmath103 changes sign . by plotting the taylor series of @xmath87 ,",
    "criticality is most evident at @xmath104 , since this temperature corresponds to the most rapidly diverging graph .",
    "subsequently , the distance to the cep if inferred from an extrapolation of the series radius of convergence .    hence , in our case , the analysis will proceed in the following order ,    * locate the critical region * observe the range over which the ising coefficients exhibit the correct alternating sign behavior indicative of a divergence along the negative @xmath52 axis * estimate the exact location of @xmath3 by plotting @xmath44 s taylor series * finally , determine the location of the critical point from our extrapolations of @xmath65 .    since we are not on the @xmath105 axis , nor are we in the infinite volume limit , the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappaall ] depict a crossover rather than a phase transition . by observing the range over which @xmath80 exhibits non - trivial behavior",
    ", we can safely say that @xmath106 is bracketed between @xmath107 $ ] for @xmath82 and @xmath108 $ ] for @xmath83 .    continuing on , the singular point that we are looking for lives on the negative @xmath52 axis of our taylor series .",
    "in other words , it is a requirement for our taylor coefficients to alternate in sign order by order .",
    "looking back at fig .",
    "[ fig : kappaall ] , we see that at @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively the @xmath111 order coefficient changes sign , thus breaking the pattern . from this observation",
    "we can refine our upper bounds on @xmath3 .    at the order that we are working with",
    ", there is a whole range ( rather than a single point ) in @xmath11 where the coefficients are observed to alternate in sign .",
    "hence , this property alone is not sufficient to specify @xmath3 .",
    "if we were to plot the full taylor series for the magnetic susceptibility @xmath44 , we would observe a genuine singularity at the critical point @xmath3 ( assuming that we are in the thermodynamic limit ) . aside from being at finite volume , we do not have the full series , so the best that we can do is plot the partial sum of the first 6 terms ( we only have 6 rather than 8 terms since we wish to plot @xmath44 rather than the free energy @xmath13 , analogous to the situation in qcd ) .",
    "the rate at which this polynomial diverges is directly attributable to the values of the taylor coefficients , _",
    "i.e.  _ the temperature at which this polynomial diverges most rapidly should give a somewhat clearer indication of the location of @xmath3 .",
    "the partial sum of @xmath44 s taylor series up to order @xmath112 is given by @xmath113    @xmath114 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi6 ] .",
    "uncertainties , when depicted , are due to the standard error of the highest order taylor coefficient ; in this case that would be @xmath80 . when @xmath82 , the @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath110 graphs , aside from being indistinguishable , diverge most rapidly . from the plots we expect that @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath83 plot suggests that @xmath118 .    now that we are led to believe that @xmath119 ( or least that @xmath3 is in the vicinity of @xmath120 ) , we will try to locate @xmath86 . in the infinite volume limit , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the radius of convergence as defined earlier , which in general is temperature dependent , and most importantly @xmath123 is finite due to non - analyticity at the critical point .",
    "however , for any finite volume , the partition function is analytic everywhere on the phase diagram , hence the radii of convergence that we measure should _ always _ diverge when @xmath62 .",
    "so , in fact , when we say that we are extrapolating @xmath65 to @xmath56 ( i.e. taking the limit defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : rinfty ] ) , what we really mean is that we expect to observe a range in values of @xmath112 where @xmath65 forms a plateau .",
    "the value of @xmath65 along this plateau is used to determine @xmath86 via eq .",
    "[ eq : hc ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rn ] , we observe exactly this sort of behavior . @xmath124",
    "forms a plateau for some ( but not all ) values of @xmath11 in the vicinity of @xmath3 ( shown in greater detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : h001rn ] ) . with @xmath83 , a plateau forms when @xmath115 , and it continues all the way up to @xmath125 .",
    "when we go to @xmath116 , we see that by @xmath125 the plateau has started to tilt upwards .",
    "the @xmath126 graphs exhibit similar behavior , see fig .",
    "[ fig : h01rn ] .    for both values of @xmath72",
    ", @xmath65 has the smallest error bars when @xmath115 ; furthermore , the plateaus that form at this temperature extend all the way up to @xmath125 .",
    "hence , our most reliable estimate of @xmath86 can be obtained from the @xmath115 graphs . within error bars , @xmath127 from @xmath73 and @xmath128 from @xmath74 .",
    "thus , from the analysis centered about @xmath82 , we can conclude that @xmath129 and @xmath130 , a finding which is in perfect agreement with the known location of the ising critical point .",
    "therefore , we have observed that this method is able to effectively locate the ising model critical point .    in working with the ising model ,",
    "we were not limited numerically , hence we carried out this analysis to @xmath131 order in the cumulant expansion without much difficulty . in doing so , we were able to make a few observations that may be of relevance to a study revolving around qcd .",
    "foremost , our best data came from the @xmath78 and @xmath79 lattices , which were the minimum sizes that could be considered `` thermodynamic . '' as we discussed , the subtraction of disconnected pieces from high order cumulants leads to a very rapid deterioration with volume in the statistics .",
    "therefore one must make a careful balancing act between large volumes to control finite - volume effects , and the loss of statistics in high - order cumulants with large volume .",
    "it is also interesting to see how the effectiveness of the method changes as one is limited to lower orders in the taylor series .",
    "plots of @xmath132 and @xmath133 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi45 ] . when limited to @xmath134 order",
    ", it would appear that @xmath135 .",
    "this is a slight overestimate , but the real issue here is that it becomes impossible to determine @xmath86 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : rn ] , [ fig : h01rn ] and [ fig : h001rn ] , we see that @xmath65 only forms a plateau for @xmath136 . at @xmath131 order",
    ", we extrapolate @xmath65 solely from @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "however , when restricted to @xmath134 order , no such extrapolation is possible , since you would only know @xmath137 .",
    "recall that , since the expansion in qcd in terms of the chemical potential only contains even powers in @xmath10 , the 4th order cumulant in the ising model is equivalent to the @xmath140 term in qcd .",
    "we have tested the prospects for the taylor series technique for locating a critical endpoint in a phase space which can not be explored directly . by finding the cumulants in terms of the unexploreable direction",
    ", one can extrapolate the radius of convergence and type of convergence to find a critical temperature and other parameter ( chemical potential in qcd ) . in the `` toy '' case where we confine ourselves to the @xmath82 line of the 3d ising model phase diagram , we calculated the taylor coefficients in an expansion of the free energy in @xmath52 . by analyzing the properties of these taylor coefficients , as well as extrapolating the radius of convergence of the series which they form",
    ", we were led to conclude that the critical point lives in the range @xmath141 and @xmath130 .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the known result that @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , we find that the taylor series method can be applied successfully to find a critical endpoint outside of the range where direct lattice studies are conducted . in this sense , the findings of this analysis offer a positive outlook for the applicability of the method to qcd .",
    "however , we found that a successful extrapolation of the critical point requires high orders in the cumulant expansion , as well as excellent control of errors . in the case we considered , an accurate determination of the distance to the critical endpoint required the use of 8 terms in the cumulant expansion ; using only 4 terms ( the number currently available in the case of qcd ) is not enough to determine the distance to the critical point accurately .",
    "in section [ sec : results ] we concluded that @xmath78 and @xmath79 lattices sufficiently approximate the thermodynamic limit when @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "this was based primarily on observations of the volume dependence of @xmath80 ( see figs . [",
    "fig : k8h01voldep ] and [ fig : k8h001voldep ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we could have reached this conclusion by calculating correlation lengths , denoted by @xmath144 . for our purposes it was sufficient to qualitatively observe the convergence of @xmath80 ,",
    "however , it is still of interest to examine the thermal dependence of @xmath144 for both background field strengths .",
    "this will serve as a non - trivial check that it was sensible to base our findings on @xmath78 and @xmath79 lattices , i.e. we should observe that @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath144 can be calculated by measuring the exponential fall - off of the two - point function @xmath146 .",
    "the tail of @xmath147 was subsequently fitted to @xmath148 since @xmath149 exhibits the correct asymptotic behaviour .",
    "@xmath150 was fixed at 0.025 , in accordance with the results found in @xcite .",
