    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars lose @xmath135 to 85% of their mass before ending up as white dwarfs .",
    "much of this mass loss takes place near the tip of the agb during the superwind stage , at mass - loss rates of up to @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( van loon et al .  1999 , 2003 ) leading to the early cessation of their stellar evolution and resulting in chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the mass loss occurs in the form of a stellar wind reaching typical outflow velocities of 5 to 30 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these winds are driven by radiation pressure on dust grains that form at a height of several stellar radii ( goldreich & scoville 1976 ) in the presence of strong radial pulsation of the base of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "likewise , more massive stars ( @xmath5 m@xmath3 ) may pass through a red supergiant phase and lose mass in a similar manner .",

    "oh is formed by the dissociation of h@xmath25o by interstellar uv radiation ( goldreich & scoville 1976 ) .",
    "as the oh maser emission is radially amplified it provides a means for measuring the speed of the fully developed wind ( elitzur , goldreich & scoville 1976 )  as opposed to the h@xmath25o masers which probe a region where the wind has not yet reached its final speed ( richards , yates & cohen 1998 , 1999 ) .",

    "the magellanic clouds have the additional advantage that their distances are reasonably well known , and hence the dependence of the wind speed on stellar luminosity can be determined . prior to this study , only seven identified oh / ir stars were known in the lmc , of which five are agb stars ( the other two are supergiants ) , and none in the smc . amongst the five agb stars ,",

    "as a result , we are able to select detectable oh / ir candidates with greater certainty . their properties and those of previously detected magellanic oh / ir stars are listed in table 1 .",
    "we adopt a distance to the lmc of @xmath31 kpc , and a distance to the smc of @xmath32 kpc .",
    "the known oh maser sources all have extremely long pulsation periods ( @xmath33 d ) and large pulsation amplitudes ( @xmath34 mag )  except the very luminous red supergiant iras04553@xmath06825 .",
    "they are all enshrouded in a thick dust envelope , making them red at short wavelengths ( @xmath35 mag ) and bright in the mid - ir ( @xmath36 jy ) .",
    "it has therefore been difficult to determine the optical spectral type for the oh / ir stars , but where it has been possible they were of late - m type .",
    "their bolometric luminosities place them near or above the tip of the agb ( @xmath37 mag ) .",
    "hence targets were selected on the basis of being oxygen - rich and luminous , having red colours and bright mid - ir flux densities , and pulsating with very long periods and large amplitudes .",
    "in particular the knowledge of the chemical type has allowed us to avoid carbon stars  which do not exhibit oh maser emission ( many of the wood et al .  ( 1992 ) targets have later been found to be carbon stars ) .",
    "unfortunately , not many such oh / ir candidates are known in the smc ; presumably because the potential candidates turn into carbon stars in this metal - deficient environment .",
    "the 64 m radio telescope at parkes , australia , was used from 14 to 22 august , 2003 , to observe the oh satellite line at 1612 mhz .",
    "the multibeam receiver was used in two orthogonal polarizations , each of 8 mhz bandwidth and sampled with 8192 channels yielding 0.18 km s@xmath4 channel@xmath4 .",
    "most of the observations were performed in frequency switching mode with a frequency throw of 0.5 mhz ( 93 km s@xmath4 at 1612 mhz ) , with integration times of 5 sec in between .",
    "total integration times amounted to about 15,000 sec , and double that for objects that were re - observed to confirm a suspected detection .",
    "the first experiments on iras04498@xmath06842 , iras04509@xmath06922 and iras04553@xmath06825 were performed in position switching mode , alternatingly observing the source and patches of ( presumed empty ) sky at @xmath38 to the north and south .",
    "most of the integration time on these sources was however obtained in frequency switching mode .",
    "iras04553@xmath06825 was observed daily and also used for flux calibration checks .",
    "the data were processed into blocks of 250 sec worth of raw data with the spectral line reduction programme spc .",
    "off - line reduction consisted of combining the spectra with the various polarizations and frequency settings , and baseline subtraction .",
    "a fortran code was written to do this , but also to first clean the spectra from human - made interference which can generate strong spikes in the spectrum .",
    "these generally decay within a couple of integrations , but they may persist in the average spectrum and be confused as a genuine feature .",
    "there was a noticeable increase in the level of this `` spikey '' noise during daytime .",
    "the code , nospike , works as follows : first a baseline is subtracted , using the mode of 50 channels at a time",
    ". then the mode of the squared values is calculated to obtain a measure for the spread , @xmath28 , specifying a minimum value for @xmath28 to make it robust against anomalously low values in the presence of strong signal .",
    "the programme then runs through every data point and if a value is greater than a specified number of @xmath28 , that value is replaced with the preceding value .",
    "the same code then averages the polarizations and frequencies as appropriate ( depending on the observing mode ) , and stacks the observations , weighted according to exposure time and the inverse square of system temperature ( which was @xmath39 k most of the time ) .",
    "the method of combining the spectra that provided the best signal - to - noise ratio was the total power method , where the frequency - switched spectra were aligned and averaged rather than ratio - ed first .",
    "this therefore did not remove the baseline , which was done by subtracting a heavily smoothed version of the original spectrum .",
    "this method was not robust enough for iras04553@xmath06825 due to its extremely strong emission , and for this source the baseline was instead fitted with a low - order polynomial function .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     tables 2 & 3 show the obtained results for the oh maser detections and non - detections , respectively .",
    "the wind speed @xmath21 is derived from the separation of the blue and red peaks , @xmath40 , rather than from the separation of the extreme velocities where emission is detected ( and which is very hard to determine in noisy spectra ) .",
    "the integrated flux is obtained by integrating over either the blue peak or the whole maser profile where the red component is clearly identified .",
    "upper limits for the emission from the targets that failed to yield a clear maser detection may be taken to be @xmath41 .",
    "the individual detections and the non - detections are described in separate subsections below .",
    "the observed velocities of the bulk of the ism seen in h  i may in some cases support or challenge claims for detected maser emission , as the oh / ir stars are generally massive ( hence young ) enough to follow the kinematics of the ambient ism from which they have formed .",

    "1998a ) at a heliocentric velocity of 239 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the peak flux density was @xmath42 mjy , at 0.7 km s@xmath4 channel@xmath4 and an rms noise level of @xmath43 mjy .",
    "our much deeper integration with parkes confirms the presence of strong oh maser emission at 240 km s@xmath4 , again peaking at @xmath42 mjy , but also shows a secondary peak blueshifted by a few km s@xmath4 ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "a complementary peak at 270 km s@xmath4 was visible , which would result in a wind speed of 15 km s@xmath4 ( but we omit this estimate from further analysis ) .",
    "the h  i data along this line - of - sight was heavily affected by emission in the sidelobes of the dish , which occurred at velocities around 240 to 260 km s@xmath4",
    ". if this is also representative for the neutral hydrogen near iras04407@xmath07000 , then these velocities are consistent with our interpretation of the strong peak at 240 km s@xmath4 being the blue component .",
    "iras04498@xmath06842 is very luminous , but its long pulsation period , large pulsation amplitude and fairly moderate mid - ir luminosity suggests it is an agb star rather than a supergiant . the high luminosity might result from hot bottom burning  which also prevents agb stars in the lmc that are more massive than @xmath14 m@xmath3 from becoming carbon stars ( van loon et al.2001a ) . or the bolometric luminosity calculated by whitelock et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which was based on the limited _ iras _ data , may be an overestimate of the true mean luminosity ( indeed the luminosity determined from _ iso _ observations is lower ) .",
    "its oh spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows a rather blunt blue - shifted peak at 246 km s@xmath4 , and a fainter red component at 272 km s@xmath4 , which implies a wind velocity of 13 km s@xmath4 .",
    "although the red component is at the limit of the detection sensitivity , it was visible on both days on which iras04498@xmath06842 was observed .",
    "the h  i emission peaks sharply at @xmath1260 km s@xmath4 , which agrees very well with the velocities of the blue and red oh maser components in iras04498@xmath06842 .",
    "although iras05003@xmath06712 is the faintest ( bolometrically and at mid - ir wavelengths ) object and has one of the shortest pulsation periods amongst the targets , it is still an extremely dust - enshrouded ( @xmath44 mag ; @xmath45 jy ) , luminous ( @xmath46 mag ) and cool ( spectral type m9 ) agb star with strong ( @xmath47 mag ) stellar pulsations .",
    "it is therefore not unexpected that we detected oh maser emission from this source ( fig .",
    "the oh spectrum ( fig .  3 ) shows a sharp blue - asymmetric peak at 268 km s@xmath4 , but it is not clear where would be the corresponding red component .",

    "extends to at least 350 km s@xmath4 , and is therefore of limited help in affirming the interpretation of the oh spectrum of iras05558@xmath07000 .",
    "the coolest , most luminous known lmc red supergiant , iras04553@xmath06825 has been much studied and was part of the sample observed by wood et al .  ( 1992 ) .",
    "it has been found to have extremely strong maser emission from several sources : oh ( wood , bessel & whiteoak 1986 ) , h@xmath25o ( van loon et al .",
    "1998b ) and sio ( van loon et al .",

    "( 1992 ) , whose observations it turned out had shown double - peaked structure within the blue - shifted component only .",
    "our new data clearly reveals two components , at 280 and 300 km s@xmath4 ( fig .  5 ) , which are red - shifted with respect to the previously detected oh maser emission as well as red - shifted with respect to the peaks in the sio and h@xmath25o maser emission which indicate the systemic ( stellar ) velocity at @xmath49 km s@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "6 )  intriguingly , an extremely sharp oh emission spike was detected at exactly this systemic velocity . the systemic velocity is confirmed by the h  i emission which peaks around @xmath1270 km s@xmath4 .    a possible explanation for the multiple maser emission components would be the presence of two expanding dust shells",
    ". the faster of these , with a wind speed of @xmath50 km s@xmath4 , is kinematically quite symmetrical with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "similar oh maser profiles in other sources have also been interpreted as due to bipolar outflows ( chapman 1988 ) . over the two decades that have passed since the first spectrum",
    ", the blue - most peak has increased in strength whilst the secondary blue component ( at 262 km s@xmath4 ) has diminished in strength .",
    "this may reflect changes in the structure of the circumstellar matter distribution , but as maser emission is a highly non - linear process it is very sensitive to small changes in the conditions required for the population inversion and velocity coherency to occur .      on the basis of the ( circum)stellar parameters the remaining three targets iras04509@xmath06922 , iras04516@xmath06902 and iras05294@xmath07104 could have been expected to exhibit oh maser emission at a similar level as the successfully detected ( agb ) oh / ir stars in the lmc .",
    "however , stronger than average interference and time constraints resulted in rather noisy spectra ( fig .  7 ; for comparison , spectra smoothed by a factor 11 are offset by a small amount ) .",
    "hints of emission features were not generally stable with time and are hence deemed spurious until confirmed .",

    "because there was no clear indication of maser emission in either of the smc targets after the first integrations , further effort was concentrated on the lmc sources .",

    "there is real overlap between sources in these two samples , and both samples can be considered equally representative of the galactic disk population of oh / ir stars , with a natural bias towards sources that lie within the solar circle .      within our sample of lmc oh / ir stars , where both blue and red peaks are detected",
    ", the blue peak is usually stronger than the red peak  exceptions to this are iras05329@xmath06708 from wood et al .",
    "( 1992 ) which has a red peak that is stronger than the blue , and iras05558@xmath07000 where both peaks are of equal strength .",
    "this was also noted in van loon et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , who proposed that the blue peak might include a contribution from amplified stellar light in addition to the amplified circumstellar radiation ( fig .",
    "9 ) . indeed",
    ", vlbi observations of nearby , galactic oh and h@xmath25o masers indicate the possibility for maser amplification of radiation originating from the stellar radiosphere ( vlemmings , van langevelde & diamond 2002 ; vlemmings et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "this predominant blue - asymmetry of the oh maser peaks in the lmc objects is in stark contrast to the rather even distribution of blue / red peak flux density ratios found in the galactic centre oh / ir stars ( fig .",
    ". there may be a dependence on the bolometric luminosity , with the most blue - asymmetric profile found in the by far most luminous object ( iras04553@xmath06825 ) .",
    "two effects may be at work here : ( i ) the lmc objects are more luminous than the galactic centre objects , which means that any contribution from amplified stellar light is expected to be greater in the lmc objects , and ( ii ) the lower metallicity  and hence lower dust - to - gas ratio  in the lmc objects may cause the contribution from amplified circumstellar radiation to be smaller than in the galactic centre objects .",
    "competition between radiation which propagates outwards through the circumstellar envelope and that which propagates inwards may enhance the blue - asymmetry in the observed oh maser profile if the outwards propagating maser utilises most of the population - inverted oh molecules , leaving little for the inwards propagating maser .",
    "this would further diminish the red maser component which results from inwards travelling radiation through the receding part of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "another consequence of this mechanism would be that the amplification of the red maser component becomes less radially beamed .",
    "this increased isotropy further diminishes the strength of the observed maser radiation and might lead to underestimation of the wind speed as inhomogeneities in the outflow yield similarly faint maser spots at a variety of projected radial velocities .",
    "our findings are corroborated by data on galactic disk oh masers ( fig .",
    "the most red - asymmetric oh maser profiles have a ratio of blue and red oh maser peak flux density of no less than 1:6",
    ". however , there are several examples of oh maser profiles with this ratio in excess of 6:1 .",
    "this suggests that extremely blue - asymmetric profiles are not merely the tail of an otherwise symmetric distribution of blue over red peak flux density ratios . on average the wind speeds of these extremely blue - asymmetric oh masers are indistinguishable from the bulk of the oh masers ,",
    "although there is a conspicuous lack of such sources with wind speeds below 10 km s@xmath4 ( fig.11 , top panel ) .",
    "they are , however , significantly brighter ( on average ) oh masers than the bulk ( fig .  11 , centre panel ) .",
    "their exclusively low galactic latitudes , @xmath55 ( fig .  11 , bottom panel ) , strongly suggest that these extreme oh masers are also more distant and hence more luminous in an absolute sense .",
    "oh / ir stars with the fastest winds , @xmath56 km s@xmath4 ( fig .  11 , top panel ) , are predominantly blue - asymmetric , in particular the two objects with @xmath57 km s@xmath4 .",
    "such fast winds are most likely due to the high luminosity of the central star .",
    "indeed , some of the best - studied red supergiants , nmlcyg , vycma , vxsgr , sper and irc+10420 have fast outflows , @xmath58 to 30 km s@xmath4 , and they all have blue - asymmetric profiles of 1612 mhz oh maser emission ( cohen et al .",
    "1987 ; richards et al .",
    "a similar situation may occur in post - agb objects where a central source of radio emission in the form of an ionized wind may dominate the maser amplification over the fainting , detached circumstellar dust envelope itself ( zijlstra et al .",
    "2001 ) .      in a lower metallicity environment",
    "the interstellar radiation field is stronger and penetrates deeper into the circumstellar envelope ( lequeux et al .",
    "1994 ) , which may lead to more dissociation of h@xmath25o into oh . however , at lower metallicity the abundance of h@xmath25o in the circumstellar envelope may be lower , resulting in a lower oh abundance .",
    "do these effects cancel ?    when plotted against bolometric magnitude ( fig .",
    "12 ) the oh maser peak flux densities of the lmc sample seem to follow from a direct scaling of the galactic centre sample .",
    "this might be reconciled with similar oh abundances in both populations of objects , where the difference in oh maser strength is only due to a difference in the amount of radiation supplied by the embedded star ( either directly or via re - emission by the circumstellar dust ) .",
    "this may seem remarkable given the fact that the abundance of the oh molecule also depends on the mass - loss rate , which is shown to depend on luminosity ( van loon et al .",
    "1999 )  but perhaps not on metallicity ( van loon 2000 ) . however , if the masers are saturated then the rate at which 1612 mhz oh photons are emitted is expected to be proportional to the pumping photon flux and hence ( see below ) the infrared flux , which is the bolometric luminosity for an optically thick envelope . in this case",
    "the metallicity does not matter .",
    "the oh maser pump efficiency may be expressed as the ratio of the oh maser peak flux density over the flux density of the 35 @xmath59 m oh line .",
    "this line is believed to be responsible ( in part ) for establishing the population inversion in the oh molecule which allows for the maser mechanism to operate ( elitzur et al .",
    "1976 ) . in the absence of direct measurements for the 35 @xmath59 m flux density",
    "the _ iras _ 25 @xmath59 m flux density is taken instead .",
    "for oh / ir stars in the galactic disk this leads to efficiencies in the region of @xmath601% to @xmath120% . with efficiencies of @xmath61% the lmc sources ( fig .  13 , circles )",
    "are indistinguishable from galactic disk objects ( fig .  13 , dots )",
    "there is no indication for the efficiency to be higher ( or lower ) in sources of blue - asymmetric oh maser profiles .",
    "this suggests that the 1612 mhz oh masers in both the galactic and lmc objects are indeed saturated .",
    "a significant contribution to the scatter observed in figs .",
    "10 & 12 is due to variability , both in bolometric luminosity and oh maser intensity .",
    "whitelock et al .  ( 2003 ) and wood et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1998 ) derived time - averaged bolometric magnitudes on the basis of near - ir photometric monitoring data , but for the most extremely dust - enshrouded sources a significant fraction of the total luminosity emerges at mid - ir wavelengths at which no such monitoring data is available .",
    "the values for @xmath6 may thus be uncertain by up to a few tenths of a magnitude , but this is accurate enough for the purpose of the analyses performed here .",
    "the oh maser spectra were generally obtained only once per object .",
    "the peak intensity of oh masers is known to vary by typically a factor two ( herman & habing 1985 ; van langevelde et al .",
    "1993 ) and , whilst contributing to the observed scatter , will not inhibit the detection of trends or a statistical comparision between the magellanic and galactic samples .",
    "if the oh maser is saturated then the peak flux density depends on the number of population - inverted oh molecules , and may thus be a measure of the mass - loss rate .",
    "baud & habing ( 1983 ) proposed a prescription for this , based on a calibration against oh / ir stars in the galactic disk .",
    "we use their prescription to predict the mass - loss rates for oh / ir stars in the lmc , in a form presented by van der veen & rugers ( 1989 ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mass - loss rate in m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , @xmath64 is the oh 1612 mhz maser peak intensity in jy , @xmath21 is the wind speed in km s@xmath4 and @xmath65 is the distance in kpc ( fig .  14 , dotted line ) .",
    "these predictions can be compared with the mass - loss rates as obtained from modeling of the spectral energy distributions by van loon et al ( 1999 ) ( fig .",
    "14 , points ) .",
    "the predicted mass - loss rates are clearly too low , but they can be brought in line with the measured mass - loss rates by reducing the oh abundance by a factor 5 ( fig .  14 , solid line )  in eq .",
    "( 2 ) the oh abundance was assumed to be @xmath66 ( see goldreich & scoville 1976 ) .",
    "this would suggest that the dominant factor in determining the oh abundance in the superwind of oh / ir stars is the oxygen abundance ( i.e.  metallicity ) , rather than the strength of the interstellar radiation field to dissociate h@xmath25o .",
    "zijlstra et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , based on a comparison with mass - loss rates as derived from the ir dust emission , proposed an alternative prescription for the _ dust _ mass - loss rate : @xmath67 the rationale behind this recipe is that if the oh maser is saturated then the maser flux depends on the ir flux which pumps the population inversion , and the oh maser is thus a measure of the dust mass - loss rate . its predictions for the lmc ( fig .",
    "15 , dotted line ) fall below the measured values ( fig .",
    "15 , points ) by a factor 2 , which may be accounted for by systematic uncertainties in the modeling of the ir emission  both for the lmc objects as well as the galactic data that was used to calibrate eq .",
    "the lmc data obey a relation of the type @xmath68 ( eq.(3 ) , fig .",
    "15 ) better than one of the type @xmath69 ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) , fig .",
    "this is unfortunate as it deprives us from a means to measure the gas mass - loss rate if the oh maser emission yields the dust mass - loss rate instead .",
    "we find a spread in wind speed comparable to that found in the galactic centre ( figs .",
    "16 & 17 ) . in general ,",
    "higher velocities are found associated with the most luminous stars ( fig .",
    "it is clear , however , that at the same luminosity , stars in the lmc have a lower wind speed .",
    "we can reproduce these trends with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which is consistent for dust - to - gas ratioes @xmath70 ( dotted sequences in fig .",
    "this is very similar to the ratio of the metallicities of the metal - rich galactic centre sample and metal - poor lmc sample .",
    "most of the oh / ir stars in the galactic centre sample have shorter pulsation periods than those in the lmc ( fig .",
    "the difference in speed is smaller between stars of comparable period than that shown in fig .",
    "in particular , the oh / ir stars with the longest pulsation periods do not generally have the fastest winds .",
    "this may be related to the changes in the stellar structure as a result of the mass lost .",

    "the galactic centre stars are almost certainly of significantly lower mass , and although their optical spectral types are not known there is no reason to believe that they should be on average warmer than m8 .",

    "netzer & knapp ( 1987 ) show that the location of a maser of molecules produced by photodissociation ( e.g.  oh ) is @xmath84 . at this distance",

    "remarkably , this critical point seems to be very nearly identical for all oh / ir stars , at an `` escape radius '' @xmath85 , despite their differences in dust formation radii and hence acceleration timescales before reaching the escape radius",
    ". this scale may thus be fundamental to driving a steady outflow , and might result from the self - regulatory nature of dust - driven winds ( struck et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the galactic centre stars have with an average wind speed of 16.7 km s@xmath4 a relatively fast wind , which in combination with their low escape velocities results in a smaller escape radius of @xmath861,400 r@xmath3 . as the escape radius is similar for magellanic objects of vastly different masses ( and luminosities ) , the most obvious stellar parameter that could be responsible for the differences between the escape radii in the lmc and the galactic centre is the metallicity .",
    "we note that the current masses of the oh / ir stars are less than their progenitor masses due to the intense mass loss that made them oh / ir objects in the first place .",
    "although the 12 and 25 @xmath59 m emission which led _ iras _ to detect the lmc sources is very bright , it originates from warm dust which was lost recently .",
    "even the oh maser emission arises predominantly from material which was ejected @xmath87 yr ago ( see van der veen & rugers 1989 ) . at a steady mass - loss rate of @xmath88 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4",
    ", this amounts to an ejected mass only of the order @xmath89 m@xmath3 .",
    "if , however , the oh / ir phase of evolution is where these stars lose most of their mass then statistically we can expect a ( relatively massive ) oh / ir star to have lost on average @xmath90% of their progenitor mass .",
    "this would reduce our estimates for their escape velocities by a factor @xmath91 and increase the ratios of @xmath92 by the same factor @xmath93 at all radii .",
    "thus the stellar wind may in fact already have reached the escape velocity very near the dust formation zone ( see fig.18 ) .",
    "the reduced masses would lead to a reduction in the value for the escape radius for lmc stars to @xmath94 .",
    "however , statistically an identical reduction would apply to all lmc stars , which would therefore still share a surprisingly common value for this lengthscale and one that is still significantly longer than for galactic centre stars .",
    "we have presented the results of a new survey for oh maser emission at 1612 mhz in the circumstellar environments of magellanic dust - enshrouded giants .    of the eight lmc sources selected , five were found to have oh masers , with at least one of the non - detections indicating that a detection is possible with increased integration time .",
    "this suggests that the sample was well chosen , due to the selection criteria employed : long pulsation period ( @xmath95 d ) , large pulsation amplitude ( @xmath96 mag ) , late oxygen - rich spectral type ( @xmath97m8 ) , red ( @xmath98 mag ) , and bolometrically and mid - ir bright ( @xmath99 mag and @xmath100 jy , respectively )",
    ". we can thus be confident in our selection of future potential oh / ir stars .",
    "the strength of the oh maser peak in the lmc detections can be readily scaled from the strength of the oh maser peak in galactic centre sources on the basis of the differences in bolometric luminosity alone , without the need for an additional scaling due to the difference in metallicity .",
    "this provides some comfort for future searches for oh masers in the smc or other low - metallicity environments .",
    "the lmc sources show a pronounced asymmetry between the strength of the blue and redshifted emission , much more so than oh / ir stars in the galactic centre .",
    "we propose that this is due to a greater contribution of amplified radiation originating from the star itself , both in an absolute sense ( bolometrically brighter stars ) and because the lower metallicity of sources in the lmc leads to a smaller contribution of ( amplified ) circumstellar emission compared with oh / ir stars in the galactic centre .    of the recipes for deriving mass - loss rates from the oh maser emission from baud & habing ( 1983 ) for the gas mass - loss rate and from zijlstra et al.(1996 ) for the dust mass - loss rate",
    "the lmc data follow the zijlstra et al.predictions better than the baud & habing predictions .",
    "this supports the interpretation of zijlstra et al .  that the oh maser strength is a measure of the ir pumping flux and thus of the dust mass - loss rate .",
    "we find that at the same luminosity or pulsation period , the difference in wind speed , @xmath21 , can be fully accounted for by metallicity effects .",
    "this agrees with the suggestion by wood et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the stars with higher @xmath21 have higher metallicity .",
    "in addition , we show that the current observations are consistent with simple radiation - driven wind theory in which the wind speed depends on luminosity , @xmath23 , and metallicity , @xmath101 , as @xmath102 .",
    "we compare the wind speed with the escape velocities , evaluated at the stellar surface , in the dust formation zone and further out in the wind .",
    "we find that the wind speed exceeds the local escape velocity at an `` escape radius '' of about 12@xmath103 r@xmath3 from the star ( just beyond the dust condensation radius )  a value which is surprisingly similar for all oh / ir stars in the lmc , agb stars and red supergiants alike ( but different for galactic centre oh / ir stars ) .",

    "<S> we present the results of a survey for oh maser emission at 1612 mhz from dust - enshrouded agb stars and supergiants in the lmc and smc , with the parkes radio telescope , aimed at deriving the speed of the superwind from the double - peaked oh maser profiles . out of 8 targets in the lmc we detected 5 , of which 3 are new detections </S>",
    "<S>  no maser emission was detected in the two smc targets . </S>",
    "<S> we detected for the first time the redshifted components of the oh maser profile in the extreme red supergiant iras04553@xmath06825 , confirming the suspicion that its wind speed had been severely underestimated . despite a much improved spectrum for iras04407@xmath07000 , which was known to exhibit a single - peaked oh maser , </S>",
    "<S> no complementary peak could be detected . </S>",
    "<S> the new detection in iras05003@xmath06712 was also single - peaked , but for two other new detections , iras04498@xmath06842 and iras05558@xmath07000 , wind speeds could be determined from their double - peaked maser profiles . the complete sample of known oh / ir stars in the lmc is compared with a sample of oh / ir stars in the galactic centre . the lmc sources generally show a pronounced asymmetry between the bright blueshifted maser emission and weaker redshifted emission , which we attribute to the greater contribution of amplification of radiation coming directly from the star itself as the lmc sources are both more luminous and less dusty than their galactic centre counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the oh maser strength is a measure of the dust ( rather than gas ) mass - loss rate . at a given luminosity or pulsation period , the wind speed in lmc sources is lower than in galactic centre sources , and the observed trends confirm simple radiation - driven wind theory if the dust - to - gas ratio is approximately proportional to the metallicity .    </S>",
