    "the variability of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has been studied extensively across a wide range of wavelengths extending from radio to x - rays .",
    "many studies have focused on establishing simple relationships between variability and various physical parameters .",
    "variability amplitude has been found to correlate with redshift @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and black hole mass on longer timescales of > 100 days @xcite , and anticorrelations have been seen with luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of models have been developed in order to explain the physical mechanisms driving the variability .",
    "processes that are external to the accretion disk have been discussed , such as variability due to multiple supernovae or starbursts which occur close to the nucleus @xcite , stellar collisions @xcite , or gravitational microlensing by small compact objects along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "recently , several studies have shown that optical variations on long timescales ( i.e. , > 100 days ) are probably the result of changes in the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "however , fluctuations in the accretion rate can not account for the optical variations seen on short timescales , of order days . in order to describe optical variations on short timescales ,",
    "some have suggested that x - ray reprocessing plays a role . in this scenario ,",
    "the x - ray continuum heats the accretion disk and changes in this x - ray continuum cause optical continuum variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    despite large observational and theoretical efforts to study variability ,",
    "the physical mechanisms behind agn variability are still poorly understood . however , studying agn variability can provide constraints on the sizes of different regions associated with the central engine .",
    "variability has been used very successfully in determining the sizes of the broad - line region ( blr ) , and consequently the mass of black holes in nearby type 1 agns , through the technique known as reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "the method uses the time delay between variations in the agn continuum and the subsequent response of the broad emission lines to measure the size of the blr . by combining the blr size with the velocity width of an emission line , typically the broad h@xmath6 line",
    ", the black hole mass can be determined using a simple viral equation .",
    "the results from reverberation mapping have led to mass measurements of about three dozen black holes at the centers of nearby active galaxies ( @xcite , 2005 ) , as well as the discovery of a correlation between the blr size and the agn continuum luminosity ( the @xmath7 relation ; @xcite , 2005 ; @xcite , 2009a ) .",
    "the @xmath7 relationship , however , is poorly constrained at the low - luminosity end , for continuum luminosities @xmath8 @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 . additionally , the low - mass end of the relationship between agn black hole mass and bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath11 ) is even more poorly determined since most of the agns making up the relationship contain black holes with masses between @xmath1 and @xmath12 m@xmath2 @xcite .    in order to increase the number of reverberation measurements at the low ends of the agn luminosity and mass regimes",
    ", we began the lick agn monitoring project , a reverberation - mapping campaign that targeted 12 nearby seyfert 1 galaxies containing black holes with expected masses between @xmath0 and @xmath13 m@xmath2 , and also the well - studied agn ngc 5548 with a black hole mass of @xmath14 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the project consisted of a mostly contiguous 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope , along with simultaneous nightly @xmath3 and @xmath4 imaging carried out at four smaller telescopes .",
    "most previous reverberation campaigns measured the agn continuum variations directly from the spectra .",
    "however , for our sample of relatively low - luminosity agns , measuring the continuum flux from broad - band images is more accurate , as we are able to obtain a better calibration and a higher signal - to - noise ratio using images rather than spectra .",
    "having regularly sampled light curves with a daily cadence over the course of a few months is useful for determining broad - line reverberation time lags and black hole masses , and also allows us to examine optical continuum variability characteristics . in this paper , we present the results from the imaging campaign .",
    "we discuss the sample selection , describe the broad - band observations , and provide details of the aperture photometry .",
    "we present the @xmath3- and @xmath4-band continuum light curves for the 13 objects , cross - correlate them to search for time delays between the two bands , and attempt to investigate the @xmath15 color for the agns . in companion papers , these agn continuum light curves are compared to the light curves of h@xmath6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) and other optical recombination lines @xcite to measure blr sizes and black hole masses .",
    "the first results from the reverberation mapping project on the object arp 151 were previously presented ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the main goal of the lick agn monitoring project is to substantially increase the number of reverberation - based black hole masses at the low end of the agn mass and luminosity range .",
    "we selected a sample of 12 nearby ( @xmath16 ) seyfert 1 galaxies with a single - epoch mass estimate of @xmath17 m@xmath2 based on the broad h@xmath6 line width .",
    "the objects were selected from @xcite and from our own library of agn spectra obtained at the palomar , lick , and keck observatories .",
    "the estimated time lag based on the 5100    continuum luminosity for these agns is 320 days , which allowed for a monitoring campaign of manageable length , extending over a few months with a nightly cadence .",
    "the objects were also required to have a strong , broad h@xmath6 emission line suitable for spectroscopic monitoring .",
    "in addition to these 12 objects , ngc 5548 , which is among the best - studied reverberation objects and known to be highly variable with a well - determined black hole mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , was also included in our sample as a control object . by adding ngc 5548 to our sample , we are able to expand the existing set of data on ngc 5548 as well as more reliably compare our new results to those from previous reverberation - mapping campaigns .",

    "for the agns observed with kait and p60 , the agn magnitude was determined by averaging over the multiple exposures taken during a single night .",
    "tenagra often obtained several individual observations of an agn throughout the course of a night , and in these instances , the average agn magnitude was calculated for exposures separated by less than one hour .    while there exists an optimal photometric aperture size that maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio for point sources @xcite , for extended sources the choice of aperture size is less clear .",
    "fluctuations in the seeing affect the extended host galaxy less than they affect a point source , which can introduce spurious variability in the agn flux .",
    "therefore , the aperture needs to be large enough to minimize the effect of variations in the seeing , but also small enough so that excessive amounts of noise from the sky background and host - galaxy light are not added to the measurements .    in order to determine the ideal aperture size , we experimented with a range of sizes for each of the objects , while keeping the same sky annulus .",
    "we used apertures and sky annuli whose radii were an integer number of pixels .",
    "we ultimately chose a single aperture size for each set of agns observed with the same telescope .",
    "the best aperture size was determined by selecting a representative agn for each telescope , cross - correlating the @xmath3-band photometric light curve and the h@xmath6 emission - line light curve ( see paper iii ) , and calculating the time lag . the aperture size which resulted in the smallest formal error on the time lag",
    "was selected as the best choice .",
    "the final apertures had radii of 320 for the three agns observed with kait , 265 for the two agns observed with p60 , and 435 for the four agns observed with tenagra .    when p60 or tenagra were unable to observe their assigned targets due to weather conditions , technical problems , or scheduling conflicts , we were sometimes able to obtain the observations with kait .",
    "we used the same comparison stars and the same photometric aperture size as was used for the images from the primary telescope , but the flux measured using the kait images appeared to be systematically lower than the flux measured using the p60 images .",
    "this offset is most likely the result of different filter transmission curves between the two telescopes , since the transmission curves for the broad - band filters used by p60 are known to deviate significantly from standard johnson transmission curves @xcite . in order to correct the issue , we compared the flux measured with a set of kait and p60 images taken on the same night . in total",

    "[ sec : obs ] , and fit the constant , color , and extinction terms of the transformation equation over the data sets where both the comparison stars and the @xcite standard stars were observed in the same night .",
    "we determined the offset between the instrumental magnitude and the calibrated magnitude for each one of the comparison stars and then applied the average offset to the agn light curve .    while the calibration of the comparison stars relative to one another and to the agn is accurate , the absolute calibration is more uncertain , especially in the cases when",
    "only a small number of landolt fields were observed over a limited airmass range from a single night .",

    "as expected , there is a wide range in the level of variability between the 13 objects in the sample .",
    "about a third of the sample ( including arp 151 , mrk 1310 , ngc 5548 , and ngc 6814 ) shows large variations of about @xmath37 mag in both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands throughout the course of the campaign . however , most of the objects ( including sbs 1116 , mrk 202 , ngc 4253 , ngc 4748 and mrk 290 ) exhibit a single event or an occasional moderate change in the continuum , where the magnitude changes by @xmath38 mag .",
    "single coherent variations like those seen at the beginning of the imaging campaign in ngc 4253 and mrk 290 further emphasize the need for continuous daily monitoring lasting several months , even for objects expected to have short time lags .",
    "the remaining objects ( mrk 142 , ic 4218 , mcg-06 - 30 - 15 , and ic 1198 ) display only small variations ( as little as @xmath39 mag ) in the continuum flux . in most cases ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath33 are higher in the @xmath3 band than in the @xmath4 band , probably due to the larger host - galaxy contribution that remains in the @xmath4 band .      for the objects in our sample , the h@xmath6 and h@xmath40 emission lines contribute of order 10% to the measured agn @xmath3-band flux .",
    "the flux of both the broad h@xmath6 and h@xmath40 lines varies throughout the campaign , and thus some of the variability seen in the photometric @xmath3-band light curve is due to the variability of the emission lines , and is not part of the continuum variability .",
    "for example , if the broad emission - line flux varies by 10% , we expect the effect of the broad emission - line variability on the variability of the photometric light curve to be small , of order 1% .",
    "we estimated the size of this effect in arp 151 by subtracting the h@xmath6 and h@xmath40 spectroscopic light curves ( determined through the spectroscopic campaign ; see paper iii for the h@xmath6 light curve ) from the photometric @xmath3-band light curve . before performing the subtraction",
    ", we created a modified photometric light curve by averaging together all photometric agn measurements taken on a single night , and removed measurements that were taken on nights when spectroscopic measurements were not made as well .",
    "we converted the photometric agn measurements into flux units .",
    "we also scaled the h@xmath6 and h@xmath40 spectroscopic light curves so that the measurements would represent the integrated flux of the emission lines as measured through a johnson @xmath3-band filter .",
    "finally , we subtracted the scaled h@xmath6 and h@xmath40 spectroscopic light curves from the modified photometric light curve , producing a light curve with variability that is independent of the h@xmath6 and h@xmath40 broad - line variability .",
    "we measured the variability characteristics of the resultant light curve , finding that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these values can be compared to the variability characteristics , @xmath43 and @xmath42 , measured from the modified photometric light curve .",
    "this verifies that the effect of the emission - line variability on the variability of the photometric @xmath3-band light curve is small , less than 1% .",
    "since arp 151 is one of the most highly variable objects in the sample , we expect the effect of emission - line variability on the variability of the photometric light curves to be smaller in the other objects .",
    "the broad - band @xmath4 filter contains a similar contribution of flux from the h@xmath6 line ( about 6% for arp 151 ) as the @xmath3-band filter , so the emission - line variations will not contribute significantly to the @xmath4-band photometric variability .",
    "one of the possible mechanisms driving the optical continuum variability on short timescales is the reprocessing of higher energy continuum fluctuations , such as x - ray variations , within the accretion disk .",
    "the reprocessing scenario predicts that variations should be seen first at short wavelengths , since the short - wavelength emission originates from a region close to the nucleus , followed by variations at longer wavelengths , since the long - wavelength emission arises from portions of the accretion disk at larger radii .",
    "the time delay between the short- and long - wavelength variations corresponds to the light travel time between the emitting portions of the accretion disk .",
    "another possibility is that fluctuations in the accretion disk drive the continuum variability . in this scenario ,",
    "long - wavelength variations should precede short - wavelength variations as the disk fluctuations propagate inward on a viscous or thermal timescale .",
    "a number of studies have searched for time delays between x - ray and optical variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , optical and ultraviolet variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , optical and near - infrared variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and even between various optical bands or uv bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the past work has found differing results . in some cases",
    "the variations seen at shorter wavelengths precede the fluctuations at longer wavelengths .",

    "we measure both positive and negative lags that range up to a few tenths of a day , but these measurements all have < 1@xmath67 significance since they are well below our nightly sampling cadence , and hence are all consistent with zero lag .",
    "these results are not surprising since the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands do not differ much in wavelength , and previous photometric monitoring campaigns ( e.g. , @xcite ) have found that lag times between @xmath3 and @xmath4 band variations are typically only a few tenths of a day .",
    "due to the near - simultaneity of variations between optical bands and between optical and uv bands , past work has also disfavored variability models in which photometric variability results from disk instabilities that propagate inward at a speed much slower than the speed of light , and instead has favored a reprocessing scenario ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "higher - frequency sampling is required to carry out a more definitive search for time lags between variations in different optical bands .",
    "in addition to searching for time delays between variations in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , we use the light curves to measure @xmath15 colors . since we employed a simple method of galaxy subtraction (  [ subsec : hostgalsub ] ) which did not account for a bulge component",
    ", the @xmath15 color represents the color of the agn and some portion of the host galaxy .",
    "we present the results for all of the objects in figure [ fig : colorvar ] .",
    "we find that the color ranges from @xmath68 mag to @xmath69 mag .",
    "there is no convincing evidence for color variability , with the exception of arp 151 , mrk 1310 , and ngc 6814 .",
    "the color varied from a maximum @xmath15 of 0.6 mag to a minimum @xmath15 of 0.4 mag for arp 151 , from @xmath70 mag to @xmath71 mag for mrk 1310 , and from @xmath72 mag to @xmath73 mag for ngc 6814 . in each case , as the agn became fainter the @xmath15 color became redder .",
    "the simplest explanation for this trend is that some of the host - galaxy starlight remains in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-band light curves , which is the result of not properly accounting for the bulge component .",
    "therefore , as the agn becomes fainter , the host - galaxy contamination becomes more significant , resulting in a redder color .",
    "the effect will be most obvious for the highly variable objects , such as arp 151 , mrk 1310 , and ngc 6814 .",
    "the color variability seen in these objects shows the limitations of our simple host - galaxy subtraction method .",
    "work by @xcite further explores color variability in a sample of bright , highly variable seyfert 1 galaxies using well - sampled data from magnum spanning seven years .",
    "they found that the optical spectral shape is independent of flux variations .",
    "also , @xcite studied a sample of moderate - luminosity agns and found that the spectral shape remains the same on weekly timescales over a rest - frame wavelength range of 28005200  .",
    "the results found by @xcite and @xcite are consistent with the constant colors found for our lower luminosity sample , and further supports our interpretation that the color variability seen in arp 151 , mrk 1310 , and ngc 6814 is the result of a residual host - galaxy contribution .",
    "as part of the lick agn monitoring project , aimed at extending the number of black hole mass measurements below @xmath74 m@xmath2 , we have carried out an imaging campaign in order to generate continuum light curves for the 13 nearby seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample .",
    "we used relative aperture photometry to measure the flux variability of the agns compared to several nearby stars .",
    "we attempted a simple host - galaxy starlight subtraction by removing a constant offset from each flux measurement based on an exponential model of the galaxy disk .",
    "more complete host - galaxy subtraction requires higher resolution images in order to disentangle the bulge component from the nucleus , which we will do using future _ hst _ observations .",
    "these agn continuum light curves are compared to h@xmath6 emission - line light curves in paper iii and other optical recombination lines in @xcite to measure blr sizes and black hole masses .",
    "there is a wide range of variability in our sample of 13 agns .",
    "about a third of the objects ( notably arp 151 , mrk 1310 , ngc 5548 , and ngc 6814 ) exhibit large variations in both the @xmath3- and @xmath4-band light curves throughout most of the campaign .",
    "many of the objects , however , show a single event or an occasional moderate change in the continuum level .",
    "other objects ( mrk 142 , ic 4218 , mcg-06 - 30 - 15 , and ic 1198 ) show very little change in the continuum flux .",
    "we do not find convincing evidence of a measurable time lag between the @xmath3- and @xmath4-band light curves for any of the objects in the sample .",
    "for all but the most variable objects , we found no significant variations in the @xmath15 color .",
    "we attribute the color variability that is seen in arp 151 , mrk 1310 , and ngc 6814 to incomplete host - galaxy subtraction .",
    "in addition to the comparison of these agn continuum light curves to the h@xmath6 emission - line light curves and the _ hst _ program to quantify the amount of host galaxy starlight , future work will compare the agn continuum light curves to other emission - line light curves , such as h@xmath75 , h@xmath40 , and he ii in order to determine time lags and black hole masses . with the measured black hole masses , we will place the objects in the sample on the @xmath11 and the @xmath76 relationships .",
    "since magnum has the capability of simultaneously obtaining optical and near - infrared images , for mrk 1310 , mcg-06 , ngc 5548 , and ngc 6814 we have near - infrared images in addition to the optical images .",
    "future work will use the near - infrared and optical continuum light curves to learn more about the size and structure of the dust torus of agns .",
    "finally , future work will investigate whether a structure function analysis can be used to determine characteristic timescales of variability for these objects .",
