    "quantum mechanics on graphs is a useful tool for the examination of quantum motion on microscopic wires , lattices and other graph - like nanostructures .",
    "the method has been intensively developed since 1980s with regard to the technological progress achieved in microfabrication .",
    "the development of the subject led to rich literature to date ; see e.g.  monographs  @xcite and references therein . on the other hand , the discipline remains relatively new and is still rapidly advancing .",
    "quantum graph models are useful in particular for a design of quantum systems with prescribed properties . in this paper",
    "we focus on scattering problems on systems consisting of several wires connected together in one point to form a star .",
    "when a particle moving along a wire reaches the vertex , it is scattered to the other wires .",
    "the scattering characteristics depend on the energy of the particle and on the nature of the potential in the point .",
    "such system is modelled by a star graph with a certain wave function coupling in the vertex .",
    "it is known that a vertex of degree @xmath1 generally features @xmath2-parametric family of admissible couplings  @xcite , and the scattering characteristics considerably vary in dependence on the coupling parameters  @xcite .",
    "obviously , one can take advantage of this fact in a design of quantum devices with particular particle transmission properties .",
    "on the other hand , the role of the coupling parameters in the scattering characteristics is not well understood yet .    the problem studied in this paper concerns a star graph with @xmath1 edges , some of which being subject to a constant nonzero potential @xmath3 .",
    "scattering in such a system depends i.a .  on the strength of the potential .",
    "it was noticed in earlier works  @xcite that a certain particular choice of the vertex coupling gives rise to a `` flat band '' scattering behaviour .",
    "that is , the probability of transmission of a particle from an edge ( we call the edge `` input '' ) to another given edge ( called `` output '' ) turned out to be constant for energies @xmath4 in the interval @xmath5 and quickly descending towards zero for @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , particles with energies exceeding the controlling potential @xmath3 mostly can not pass to the output edge .",
    "the vertex thus works as a controllable band - pass filter with a flat passband . in this paper",
    "we will deal with the problem more thoroughly .",
    "we will prove that this behaviour can occur only for certain subfamilies of vertex couplings , but at the same time we will demonstrate that there exists a multiparametric family of vertex couplings with the `` flat passband '' property .",
    "in other words , such a behaviour is less rare than it might seem earlier .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : preliminaries ]",
    "we bring together elementary facts and notation on vertex couplings and scattering in quantum graph vertices .",
    "section  [ sect.filter ] presents the concept of a controllable band - pass filter and the goals of the paper , as well as the idea of solution .",
    "sections  [ sect.1][sect.3 ] are devoted to the existence of quantum graph filters featuring flat passbands .",
    "the main result is presented in section  [ sect.2 ] , in which several designs are proposed .",
    "a wave function of a particle confined to a star graph having @xmath1 arms consists of @xmath1 components , @xmath7 .",
    "the coordinate on each arm is chosen such that @xmath8 corresponds to the center of the star graph and the variable grows in the outgoing direction . if there are potentials @xmath9 imposed on the arms , the hamiltonian acts as @xmath10 at each arm @xmath11 ( we choose the units so that @xmath12 for @xmath13 being the mass of the particle ) .",
    "properties of the vertex are determined by boundary conditions that are conventionally written in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the boundary vectors and @xmath16 are complex @xmath17 matrices satisfying @xmath18 cf .",
    "the symbol @xmath19 denotes the @xmath20 matrix formed from columns of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in this paper",
    "we will take advantage of the so - called @xmath0-form of boundary conditions  @xcite , in which requirements   are implicitly satisfied due to a special choice of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "namely , the @xmath0-form relies on the block decomposition of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 for a certain @xmath24 .",
    "matrix @xmath25 is a general complex @xmath26 matrix , @xmath27 is a hermitian matrix of order @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are identity matrices of given orders .",
    "the value @xmath28 corresponds to @xmath30 in boundary conditions .",
    "if a wave corresponding to a quantum particle with energy @xmath4 reaches the vertex from the @xmath31-th line with amplitude @xmath32 , the wave is reflected with a complex amplitude @xmath33 and transmitted to the lines nos .",
    "@xmath34 with complex amplitudes @xmath35 .",
    "the scattering amplitudes form the scattering matrix of the vertex .",
    "the scattering matrix , denoted by @xmath36 , is an @xmath17 matrix function of particle energy that is given by the formula @xmath37 let us emphasize that formula   applies only if @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath40 into equation  , we obtain the scattering matrix expressed in terms of the @xmath0-form of boundary conditions , @xmath41 cf .",
    "it is straightforward to see from formula   that the scattering matrix is constant with respect to @xmath4 if and only if the matrix @xmath27 in the @xmath0-form of boundary conditions   vanishes , i.e. , when @xmath42 vertex couplings having energy - independent scattering matrices are called scale invariant couplings .",
    "they are widely studied ; see  @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum star graph with @xmath1 edges .",
    "we will regard one of the edges as _ input _ , another edge as _",
    "output_. the remaining @xmath43 edges will be assumed to be of two types , see figure  [ filter ] :    * lines with constant nonzero potentials ( _ `` controlling lines '' _ ) ; * lines without potentials ( _ `` drains '' _ ) .        for a particle coming in the vertex along the input line with energy @xmath4 , we denote the complex transmission amplitude to the output line by the symbol @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding transmission probability in the channel is @xmath45 .",
    "this paper is concerned with the relation between the transmission probability in the input - output channel and the potentials on the controlling lines .",
    "more specifically , we will search for couplings that can serve as controllable band - pass filters with flat passbands .",
    "that is , the function @xmath46 is required to have the following three properties , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig.passband ] .",
    "@xmath47 we assume that @xmath3 is the value of the constant potential on the controlling lines .        in general ,",
    "the transmission amplitude in the input - output channel is given by the term @xmath48_{oi}$ ] of the scattering matrix .",
    "however , formula   can not be applied straightforwardly , because the controlling lines are subject to constant potentials @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we will approach the problem as follows . at first",
    "we transform the original boundary conditions in the vertex of degree @xmath1 to boundary conditions in a vertex of degree @xmath50 .",
    "this step is based on the idea that the controlling lines and drains support only outgoing waves , thus the corresponding wave function components are multiples of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the momentum on the @xmath53-th line with potential @xmath54 .",
    "relation @xmath55 implies @xmath56 equation   allows us to eliminate the boundary values @xmath57 and @xmath58 at all controlling edges and drains from boundary conditions  .",
    "we obtain boundary conditions in a vertex of degree @xmath50 that connect just the input and the output , @xmath59 where @xmath60 are boundary values at input and output line .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath61 are @xmath62 matrices that generally do _ not _ obey the requirements  , because @xmath63 can be broken due to the dissipation in the vertex , manifested through `` hidden '' drains and controllers . on the other hand , since neither input line nor the output line support a potential , formula   applies without reserve .",
    "once we subsitute matrices @xmath64 from reduced boundary conditions   into equation  , we obtain the @xmath62 scattering matrix that characterizes wave propagation in the input - output channel .",
    "in particular , the @xmath65-term of the matrix is the sought transmission amplitude @xmath44 .    for the derivation of matrices @xmath61",
    ", we will take advantage of the @xmath0-form of boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , the calculation depends on the parameter @xmath28 . in the following section we begin with the case @xmath66",
    "the @xmath0-form   of boundary conditions for @xmath66 uses matrices @xmath67 and @xmath68 . we may assume without loss of generality that line no .",
    "1 is the input and line no .",
    "2 is the output .",
    "let us follow the steps outlined in section  [ sect.filter ] .",
    "after eliminating @xmath69 from the system using identities  , we get dissipative boundary conditions   with @xmath70 when we substitute @xmath61 into formula  , we obtain the scattering matrix describing the input - output interface , @xmath71 the transmission amplitude is given as the term @xmath72_{21}$ ] , i.e. , @xmath73    now we are ready to check whether @xmath27 and @xmath25 can be chosen such that the function @xmath45 satisfies conditions  . condition   is equivalent to @xmath74 .",
    "equation   implies @xmath75 for all @xmath76 ; hence @xmath77 consequently @xmath78 however , the choice @xmath79 implies @xmath80 for all @xmath81 ( cf .  ) , which contradicts condition  .",
    "( in physical terms , @xmath79 corresponds to a vertex with line no .",
    "@xmath50 completely decoupled . ) to sum up , conditions   and   can not be satisfied at the same time .",
    "we conclude that a band - pass filter with flat passband can not be constructed using a vertex coupling with @xmath66 .",
    "now we consider boundary conditions   with @xmath83 such that the columns of @xmath22 corresponding to the input and output are linearly dependent",
    ". we can assume without loss of generality that the input corresponds to line no .  1 and the output is line no .  @xmath1 .",
    "when the boundary conditions are written in the @xmath0-torm , the linear dependence implies that the last column of @xmath25 is a transposition of the vector @xmath84 for a certain @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-form of boundary conditions reads as follows , @xmath86 where @xmath87 are identity matrices of given orders and @xmath88 , @xmath89 . recall that symbols @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote boundary values at the input and output line , respectively .",
    "symbols @xmath92 stand for boundary vectors at controlling edges and drains .",
    "values @xmath93 obey relations  , i.e. , @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we use identity   to eliminate @xmath97 and @xmath98 from system  . in this way",
    "we obtain boundary conditions   with @xmath99 where @xmath100 the dissipative scattering matrix corresponding to matrices   is @xmath101 the transmission amplitude thus equals @xmath102 now we check condition  . since @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 hence @xmath106 note that @xmath107 is a non - negative number for any choice of @xmath108 .",
