    "the successful development of techniques to monitor microlensing events toward the center of the galaxy has provided an additional observational probe of galactic properties .",
    "already an optical depth that exceeds predictions ( alcock _ et al _ 1996 ; udalski _ et al _ 1994 ) has confirmed other indications ( dwek _ et al _ 1995 ) that the galactic bulge must be bar shaped with the long axis pointing toward us ( paczyski _ et al _ 1994 ) .",
    "more massive lenses tend to have longer time scales , so microlensing places statistical constraints on the mass function of the stellar lenses , although other variables entering into the time scale weaken these constraints .",
    "attempts to define the mass function of the lenses from statistical arguments or from the event time scale frequency distribution have led to models with a large population of brown dwarfs in the bulge ( han and gould 1996 ; han 1998 ) but other models exist with few or no brown dwarfs ( zhao , rich & spergel 1996 ; zhao and dezeeuw 1997 ; mera , cabrier & schaeffer 1998 ) . by measuring optical depth and the distribution of event time scales as a function of the line of sight direction , microlensing can also constrain the distribution of stars in the bar . so far there is insufficient data published [ 40 secure events from the macho ( massive compact halo objects ) group ( alcock _ et al _ 1996 ) and 12 from the ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) ] group ( udalski _ et al _ 1994 ) ] for such constraints to be very definitive .",
    "in fact , the lack of sufficient observations of all types that can constrain the properties of the galaxy means that few of the potential constraints on galactic structure , kinematics or content that microlensing can contribute to can be yet realized ",
    "the major exception perhaps being the confirmation of the bar .    the microlensing optical depth is the probability that a microlensing event will be occurring at any instant in a particular direction for a single source .",
    "the time scale frequency is the number of events of a particular duration that occur per unit time , where the unit of time can be the entire observational period and the number of sources can be all of those monitored .",
    "these two measures are routinely obtained from a microlensing observational program aimed at monitoring stars toward the galactic center , and form the basis for constraining galactic properties .",
    "it is important to appreciate the sensitivity of such data to the various galactic parameters on which they depend , since they are related to the galaxy through models with assumed values of the parameters .",
    "most of the galactic parameters such as stellar velocities as a function of position are poorly constrained observationally , which may allow several ways to match microlensing data with very different galactic models .",
    "given this uncertainty , we wish to investigate the sensitivity of time scale frequency distributions and optical depths to changes in the values of several galactic parameters , and compare the model microlensing measures at every step with the empirical measures deduced from the microlensing events followed by the macho group during the summer of 1993 ( alcock _ et al _ 1996 ) .",
    "we eliminate the two stars that are likely to be variable stars , two stars that might fail to pass the macho criteria for inclusion and one binary star from the data set .",
    "this leaves a rather meager data set of only 40 events , but we chose not to add the 12 ogle events in the interest of having a data set all of whose entries are analyzed the same way . the small gain in the statistics from adding the ogle events",
    "does not warrant the added complication .",
    "the best model of the distribution of stars in the galactic bulge is that due to zhao ( 1996 ) .",
    "this model of the bar - shaped galactic bulge is based on a model of dwek _ et al _ ( 1994 ) that reproduces the cobe ir surface brightness distributions , but which is also consistent with all other available observations of bulge kinematics .",
    "a highly peaked galactic nucleus is added to the triaxial `` boxy '' gaussian distribution of the bar to produce the observed central kinematics .",
    "we use the zhao distribution of stellar mass ( bar plus nucleus ) and the double exponential disk distribution of stars of bahcall and soneira ( 1980 ) as a basis for determining microlensing event time scale frequency distributions and microlensing optical depths as functions of galactic parameters and direction of the line of sight .    in section 2",
    "we develop a general scheme for determining time scale frequency distributions , in which it is relatively easy to substitute a variety of stellar spatial distributions ( although we limit these particular changes to different bar orientations ) , stellar velocities that depend on position in the galaxy , mass functions , luminosity functions and line - of - sight directions . in section 3",
    "we discuss galactic models in general and give details of the particular model that will be the basis for the calculations .",
    "a short section 4 describes the monte carlo integration scheme for two choices of independent variables in the six dimensional integral defining the time scale frequency distribution .",
    "section 5 is a series of example calculations , where the first example is a demonstration of the robustness of the time scale frequency distribution obtained with either choice of independent variables .",
    "the remaining examples show the effects of changing the visibility of the sources , the orientation of the long axis of the galactic bar relative to the line from the observer to the galactic center , the velocity model , the velocity dispersions within one model , the mass function and the direction of the line of sight .",
    "the empirical time scale frequency distribution is superposed on most of the graphs for comparison .",
    "the last example in section 5 demonstrates an almost perfect match of the average of model time scale frequency distributions over the 24 macho field directions with the empirical distribution .",
    "a brief derivation of the optical depth averaged over the source distribution along the line of sight begins section 6 .",
    "this expression is used to demonstrate a relatively large variation in optical depth over a region that includes baade s window .",
    "the spatial distribution of optical depths along each macho line of sight is compared with the average optical depth determined empirically from the macho observations , where the same model giving such a good match to the empirical time scale frequency distribution gives an average optical depth that is about @xmath3 below the empirical mean .",
    "the average of the model optical depths over the macho fields is raised almost to the empirical mean if the bulge mass is multiplied by 1.5 .",
    "the variation of optical depth for a particular direction on source visibility and orientation of the bulge axis is also determined . in both sections 5 and 6",
    ", we show the contributions of each separate part of the distribution of stars , which demonstrates how little the disk contributes to both the event rate and optical depth relative to the bulge .",
    "the discussion in section 7 points out virtues of and weaknesses in our particular formulation , emphasizes the sensitivity of results to assumptions within the models , cautions the reader about taking our model match to the data too seriously given the large uncertainties in the real galactic model , but points out the eventual power of microlensing to play a major role in the entire suite of observations that will define the properties of the galaxy in the future .",
    "our conclusions are enumerated in a brief section 8 .",
    "a microlensing event is said to occur whenever a source star and lens star pass each other at an angular separation within that of the einstein ring radius @xmath4 of the lens .",
    "the time scale for such an event is defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnitude of the relative transverse velocity between source and lens projected onto the lens plane .",
    "this projected transverse relative velocity is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the transverse velocities of the lens , source and observer respectively relative to inertial space , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances to the lens and source .",
    "the einstein ring radius is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the lens mass and @xmath15 is the velocity of light .",
    "a single source at distance @xmath11 will lead to microlensing events with lenses within mass range @xmath16 of mass @xmath14 , within @xmath17 of @xmath10 , and with einstein ring radii @xmath4 at the rate of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number density of lenses with masses within @xmath16 of @xmath14 so that @xmath20 is the areal density of lenses in the mass range @xmath16 in the slab of thickness @xmath17 at @xmath10 .",
    "the rate is expressed in terms of mass density of lenses through @xmath21 , where the @xmath14 in the denominator cancels the @xmath14 in @xmath22 in the second form .",
    "the transverse velocity @xmath23 has components @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the directions of increasing galactic latitude and longitude respectively , such that @xmath26 with @xmath27 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vdetails ] ) , @xmath28 is the circular velocity of the local standard of rest , @xmath29 are the peculiar velocity components of the observer relative to the lsr , @xmath30 is the circular velocity of the galaxy at @xmath10 , @xmath31 are the random lens velocities relative to the mean galactic rotation , @xmath32 is the circular velocity of the galaxy at @xmath11 , and @xmath33 are the random source velocities .",
    "we shall separate the distribution of stars in the galaxy into disk and triaxial bulge distributions with their own circular velocity distributions and velocity dispersions , where the latter are gaussian distributed about the mean circular velocities .",
    "the number of source stars in a given field that are visible in range @xmath34 at @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number density of sources at @xmath11 , and where the exponent follows from the increase in area of the cross section of the angular field with distance and from the assumption that the fraction of stars with luminosities greater than some @xmath37 varies as @xmath38 ( kiraga and paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "hence , the fraction of the visible sources in the field that are within the slab of thickness @xmath34 is given by @xmath39    the expression ( [ eq : frate ] ) is constrained to lenses within @xmath17 at @xmath10 and to lens masses within @xmath16 of @xmath14 . to further constrain the event rate to particular ranges of lens and source random velocities and to a range of source distances @xmath34 ,",
    "we must multiply by the respective fractions of lenses and sources contained within the small range of each parameter .",
    "hence @xmath40 is the rate of events for a single source within @xmath34 of @xmath11 that also has random velocities within @xmath41 of @xmath42 for lenses within @xmath17 of @xmath10 with random velocities within @xmath43 of @xmath44 and with mass within @xmath16 of @xmath14 .",
    "the gaussian velocity distributions are represented by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the rms value of @xmath47 the circular velocities of the galaxy are assumed known from the galactic model .",
    "the particular values of all seven parameters in eq .",

    "the time scale @xmath53 is normalized by @xmath54 which is the time scale for an event with a solar mass lens located at a distance of 4 kpc with the source at the galactic center ( 8 kpc ) .",
    "the source is assumed at rest and the lens velocity and observer velocity are both assumed to be the circular velocity @xmath28 consistent with a flat galaxy rotation curve .",
    "the numerical value for @xmath55 is obtained with @xmath56 km / sec ( alvarez , may & bronfmann 1990 ; clemens 1985 ) .",
    "these normalizations yield @xmath57 as the number of events / sec / source/(unit @xmath53 ) at time scale @xmath49 .",
    "the numerical coefficient means @xmath58 is expressed in @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and it is understood that all velocities are normalized by @xmath28 and @xmath53 by @xmath55 .",
    "the integral limits correspond to the variables in the same order as the differentials in the integrand .",
    "the integral over @xmath62 starts at 0.1 instead of 0 to avoid the singularity in the integrand .",
    "there are likely to be no sources involved in microlensing events closer to us than 0.8 kpc .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath62 extends the range beyond the galactic center were source visibility begins to fade from either distance or blending .",
    "one can experiment with the effect of changing these limits , since the extent of blending of stellar images depends on observing site seeing .",
    "the integral is to be evaluated approximately with a monte carlo technique , but first the dimension is reduced by one by changing variables from @xmath63 @xmath64 to @xmath65 and integrating over the @xmath66 function .",

    "we shall demonstrate this below , but use the simpler form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcarlo ] ) in subsequent calculations , wherein it is easy to introduce additional @xmath73 and @xmath62 dependence into the velocities .",
    "there is an arbitrary degree of complexity that one may incorporate into the galactic models that specify the distributions of stars and their velocities , and many of the parameters are not well constrained by observations .",
    "the random velocities @xmath88 in general with similar dependencies on parameters for @xmath89 .",
    "the dependency of the velocity dispersion on stellar mass @xmath14 is consistent with the increasing thickness of the spatial distribution in the disk with decreasing mass ( _ e.g. _ mihalas and binney , 1981 ) .",
    "the best model of the galactic bar consistent with the cobe ir intensity distribution ( zhao 1996 ) shows explicitly the dependence of the dispersions on @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "part of the dependence of the velocities on @xmath73 can be accounted for by separating the galaxy into disk and bulge regions with different velocity dispersions in each region but with the dispersions being otherwise independent of @xmath73 and @xmath62 respectively for lenses and sources .",
    "this latter assumption was used explicitly in evaluating @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dzdte ] ) , where the @xmath73 dependence of the velocities was ignored . we will relax this assumption in some of the examples below .",
    "the mean circular velocity of the gas clouds in the galactic disk appears to be a function of @xmath73 or @xmath62 ( clemens 1985 ) , but the rather complex rotation curve is usually approximated as flat with all mean circular velocities equal to @xmath28 ( alvarez _ et al _ 1990 ) .",
    "( here we ignore any peculiar velocity of the @xmath93 relative to the local mean circular velocity ( clemens 1985 ) . )",
    "the mean circular velocity of the stars is assumed to be the same as that of the gas clouds .",
    "a distribution of box - like orbits in the zhao ( 1996 ) bar model matches the observed hi velocity distribution , and predicts the velocity dispersions that should be expected as a function of @xmath90 and @xmath91 and presumably as a function of @xmath73 or @xmath62 inside the bulge .",
    "microlensing should eventually prove a powerful constraint on the stellar mass function for the stellar spatial distribution that dominates the lens population , which is apparently the central bar .",
    "this is especially so for the lower mass stars , since there is no other way of observing these stars .",
    "generally , one expects the mass function to depend on @xmath73 ( or @xmath62 ) in general , but that dependence is unknown .",
    "the frequency of event time scales is the microlensing constraint on the mass function , where the fraction of shorter time scales increases as the fraction of the mass density that is in the smallest stars or brown dwarfs is increased .",
    "however , increasing the velocity dispersions or otherwise increasing relative transverse velocities between lenses and sources and concentrating more of the lenses closer to the center of the galaxy both increase the fraction of short time scale events .",
    "so constraints on dispersions and spatial distributions of lenses and sources must be secure before definitive mass functions can be ascertained .",
    "we have adopted above the assumption of kiraga and paczyski ( 1994 ) that the luminosity function of the sources is such that the fraction of stars with luminosities greater than some luminosity @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "this appears to be a fairly good approximation over the important range of luminosities in k band ( tiede , frogel & terndrup 1995 ) , but less so in the visual band where the microlensing observations are made .",
    "more complex luminosity functions may affect conclusions based on microlensing data but are not warranted by observational constraints at this time .",
    "data provided in tiede _",
    "et al _ ( 1995 ) yield @xmath94 , which value is assumed in most of the examples herein .    in principle",
    ", one could incorporate any of these complexities into the galactic model , but there is little motivation for doing very much of this until observational constraints become more secure .",
    "even without this security , one can determine the effect of various assumptions on the microlensing time scale rate and optical depth ( zhao and dezeeuw 1998 ) in anticipation of future selection .",
    "for our purposes here , we shall adopt a galactic model for the integration of eq .",

    "we shall also consider the case where the bar is not rotating , but neither of these assumptions is consistent with the results of alvarez _ et al _ ( 1990 ) who find the flat rotation curve of the galaxy gas clouds ( 210 km / sec ) to persist down to 2 kpc from the center with velocities exceeding 210 km / sec at smaller galacto - centric distances .",
    "however , there are non circular streaming motions in the bar that could boost the apparent rotation inside 3.3 kpc ( zhao 1996 ) .",
    "finally , in most of our examples we shall consider the case where both circular velocities and velocity dispersions for lenses and sources are functions of where they are located in the galaxy .",

    "the severe lack of small mass stars leads to the shift in the peak in the distribution to longer time scales , more moderately long period events , and a rather modest total number of events . extending the very steep mass function into the brown dwarf region ( @xmath176 ) fails worse than the same exercise with the kroupa mass function in matching the macho data",
    "since the peak of the distribution is moved even further toward very short time scales ( @xmath177 4.5 days ) , exceeding the macho numbers there while failing by a factor of at least two to produce a sufficient number of events of time scales between 5 and 20 days .",

    "we should point out here that zhao _",
    "et al _ ( 1996 ) are able to get a good match to the macho data with a comparable mass function and velocity dispersion as that used here without the nucleus , whereas we require the nucleus be kept for a good match . like the mera _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) match to the macho data with the kroupa mass function which failed for our model , this again illustrates the model and procedure dependence of estimated time scale frequencies that is independent of and thereby weakens the constraints on the mass function .",
    "the zhao model is also very sensitive to the galactic coordinates of the line of sight .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : eflatitude ] and [ fig : eflongitude ] , which show the time scale frequency distributions along two perpendicular traces through baade s window whose galactic latitude ( @xmath178 ) bisects the more extended region where the macho dat was obtained .",
    "the smaller scale lengths assumed in the z direction for both the bar and nucleus results in the more rapid fall off in events at higher galactic latitudes than for higher galactic longitudes .",
    "recall that we have eliminated the singular nature of the nucleus by truncating the nucleus density at the galactic center by assuming that density uniform for constant @xmath96 inside 560 pc .",
    "the nucleus thereby loses about 36% of its mass but the whole bulge loses only 7% .",
    "if the nucleus is not truncated , both the rate of events and the optical depth become very large as the line of sight approaches the center of the galaxy .",
    "et al _ ( 1996 ) avoid this problem by eliminating the nucleus altogether , but we require the nucleus stars to match the macho data as discussed above .",
    "the large dependence of the event rate on coordinates of the line of sight means that microlensing will also eventually prove a powerful constraint on bar model star distributions as well as mass functions if other parameters such as the velocity dispersions can be adequately defined . as the macho fields are spread over several degrees near baade s window , ( fig . 1 of alcock _ et",
    "al _ ( 1996 ) ) , it is appropriate that the model event frequency distributions be averaged over the macho fields for comparison with their results .",
    "this average is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : machoave ] for basu and rana and holtzman _ et al _ mass functions and their modifications by the more negative indices for low mass stars .",
    "both modified mass functions yield good agreement with the data with the best match probably obtained with an index between -2.2 and -2.5 .",
    "however , given all of the uncertainties in the model parameters discussed above and the simplicity of the model itself , this agreement must be regarded as fortuitous and should not be regarded as a definitive constraint on the mass function .",
    "note , however , that there is as yet no need to assume that there is any significant fraction of the bulge mass in brown dwarfs  a conclusion also reached by zhao _",
    "et al _ ( 1996 ) . on the other hand , we do need more m stars in the mass functions than obtained from the star counts in order to match the macho data .",
    "there may be a not unreasonable galaxy model that will yield a sufficient number of short time scale events with a @xmath179 variation of the mass function in the m star region , but the necessary changes in the parameters of the model adopted here seem too extreme .",
    "but the uncertainties in the most relevant mass function of the galactic bulge stars obtained by holtzman _ et al _ , the paucity of the microlensing data and modest observational constraints on the galactic model itself do not yet warrant a search for a drastically different galactic model .",
    "we now turn to a determination of the optical depth as a function of the line of sight .",
    "we shall see that a similar average over the macho lines of sights for our best matching model also gives reasonable agreement with the macho estimates .",
    "we shall eventually conclude that the zhao model distribution of stars with our assumptions about the mass function and the velocity distribution yields a good match to both the estimated optical depth and the time scale frequency distribution of the 1993 macho data , but that the meagerness of this data and the uncertainties within the galactic models means that the microlensing constraints on both the mass function and the distributions of lens and source stars are very weak indeed .",

    "the nucleus becomes more important when the line of sight passes very close to the galactic center .",
    "the optical depth for the complete model would turn up sharply at small galactic latitudes in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauremovals ] without the truncation of the nucleus .",
    "we have developed a procedure for determining model time scale frequency distributions for microlensing events toward the center of the galaxy that can be easily modified for improvements in galaxy models as they become available .",
    "two methods of evaluating the integral used to accumulate all of the combinations of variables leading to the same time scale give the same distribution within the errors of the monte carlo integrations ( fig [ fig : mvszcmpre ] ) .",
    "this robustness of the model distribution gives one some confidence that the computational procedure is sound .",
    "that changes in the distributions as various parameters are varied in a series of examples were as expected increases this confidence .",
    "the complete variable dependence of the event time scale is maintained within the integral used to accumulate all the combinations of variables leading to the same time scale .",
    "this contrasts to some work in the literature where event rates are determined for all of the lenses being @xmath202 with a later convolution over the mass function ( e.g. kiraga and paczyski 1994 ; zhao _ et al _ 1996 ) .",
    "however , it seems implicitly assumed in this latter procedure that galactic models are secure enough that the mass function can be separated out as the major unknown and meaningfully constrained by substituting various forms into the convolution .",
    "there would also appear to be some danger of introducing some artifacts into the computation by such piecewise averaging . within the zhao ( 1996 ) bulge model ( bar plus nucleus ) and the double exponential bahcall and soneira disk model that we have adopted , the time scale frequency distributions are very sensitive to the total bulge mass , the circular velocity model , velocity dispersions and the direction of the line of sight as well as the mass function .",
    "other bulge and disk distributions of stars will introduce still other variations .",
    "so until the properties of the galaxy are better constrained , it seems premature to assign the highest priority to the mass function in matching the model time scale frequency distributions to the observations .    with our nominal adornments to the zhao bulge model ,",
    "we obtain a good match to the macho time scale frequency distribution with an optical depth that is only slightly too low ( figs .",
    "[ fig : machoave ] and [ fig : taumacho ] ) .",
    "but we do this only by changing the index of either the basu and rana or holtzman mass function from -1 to -2.5 and -2.2 respectively in the m star region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : machoave ] ) .",
    "the kroupa mass function has a slope of -2.35 for the latest m stars , but the gould _",

    "et al _ ( 1998 ) being completely speculative . from figure",
    "[ fig : machoave ] one is led to an index somewhere between -2.2 and -2.5 for an even better fit to the macho data within the overall model .",

    "et al _ mass function for bulge stars in the m star region ( @xmath2 ) where most of the lenses reside is like that of basu and rana and also gould _",
    "et al _ if unresolved binaries are accounted for in the latter .",
    "so the only observational support for the steeper mass function in the m star region is consistency with a meager macho data set .",
    "still , microlensing may be detecting m stars that are not accounted for in the star counts because of difficulties in estimating the completeness of the optical surveys ( holtzman , private communication , 1998 ) , or the meagerness of the microlensing data set may make the empirical event rates not entirely representative .    with a different velocity model , or with other than a zhao bulge distribution of stars , our match may become less striking .",
    "still , it is significant that we found a model consistent with the microlensing data without resorting to a large population of brown dwarfs as advocated by several authors ( _ e.g. _ han and gould ( 1996 ) ; han 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , we find that extending the kroupa and gould _ et al _ mass functions into the brown dwarf region produced too many very short time scale events and an insufficient number of moderate time scale events ( figs .",
    "[ fig : efmassfns ] and [ fig : efmassfns2 ] ) , although at least the kroupa mass function including brown dwarfs might have been a better fit if we had just decreased the velocity dispersions or changed the bulge mass .",
    "our use of the kiraga and paczyski luminosity function index @xmath166 as a measure of source visibility is useful for verifying consistent behavior of the distributions derived by this procedure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : efbeta ] ) , but it is actually not a good representation .",
    "first , the luminosity function is not so simply behaved in the visible region , and second , blending is a much more important limitation on source visibility than apparent brightness",
    ". the representation might be useful in accounting for source visibility in highly obscured regions , but there are likely to be too few visible sources in these circumstances to motivate an extensive microlensing search .",
    "penetration of these regions by using infrared wavelengths would return us to blending as the most important limitation .",
    "although there is a need for a more realistic model of source visibility , it is probably less important than other uncertainties in the galactic model .    the change in the distribution function as we altered the inclination @xmath113 of the bar axis to the observer - galactic center line also showed consistent behavior for the model ( fig [ fig : ef0133065 ] ) as did the optical depth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taubeta ] ) . although this inclination is uncertain to some extent , which fact motivated our investigation of its effect , changing the inclination also requires changing the shape of the bar to remain consistent with the cobe observations ( zhao 1998 ) .",
    "we left the bar shape unaltered during this exercise , but other uncertainties preclude a more complicated model .",
    "it not clear just how well our velocity model represents the real world , but a more complicated one is not warranted now .",
    "certainly , the velocity dispersion must have a more complicated @xmath73 and @xmath62 dependence than the one that we used mostly ( _ e.g. _ figs .",
    "[ fig : efbeta ] and [ fig : ef0133065 ] ) , and the flat circular velocity of the disk and ramped circular velocity of the bulge can only be rather crude approximations .",
    "still , it is useful to realize the extreme variation in the calculated time scale frequency distributions simply by changing the velocity dispersions within the model ( fig . [",
    "fig : veldispers ] ) or by a change in the model itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ef133065 ] ) . a velocity model , both circular velocities and dispersions or even more complicated models accounting for the box like orbits in the zhao ( 1996 ) bulge model , that does not represent the real galaxy very well may lead to , say , the adoption of a mass function in matching microlensing data that is far from reality .",
    "we have so far in this discussion concentrated on the uncertainties in deducing galactic properties from microlensing time scale frequency distributions and optical depths toward the galactic center .",
    "however , the sensitivity of such microlensing data to changes in the model illustrated by our series of examples shows just how powerful the technique will eventually prove to be in the study of galactic structure . figs .",
    "[ fig : eflatitude ] , [ fig : eflongitude ] , [ fig : tautotz ] and [ fig : taumacho ] show the very rapid variation in both optical depth and time scale frequency distributions with relatively small changes in the line of sight direction .",
    "if such variations do not emerge with the collection and analysis of many more events to obtain the necessary spatial resolution , one would have to drastically revise current ideas about the nature of the bar .",
    "much better spatial resolution may already be possible from the more than 200 additional events that have been monitored since 1993 , but that remain unanalyzed and unpublished .",
    "recall also that all ways to improve the fit to the data are not equivalent . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ef0133065 ] , the basu and rana mass function led to a time scale frequency distribution that produced far too few short time scale events for @xmath169 , one of the preferred inclination angles for the bar axis .",
    "we increased the number of these events for this inclination by increasing the galactic mass by a factor of 1.5 , an increase that might be tolerated by other observational constraints .",
    "if the macho distribution is close to the correct one , the number of events predicted between about 15 and 40 days is now too large . a better way to match the data was to increase the magnitude of the index in the m star range of the basu and rana or holtzman _ et al _ mass functions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : machoave ] .",
    "so microlensing will place constraints on the galactic distribution of stars , their distributions of velocities and the mass function , but other more conventional observations must also be accumulated to independently constrain the parameters for a gradual convergence to the true properties of the galaxy . certainly with only 40 data points , very uncertain velocities and still uncertain star distribution in spite of the success of the zhao ( 1996 ) model ( we have not even discussed deviations from axial , radial or bar symmetry . ) , it is premature to assert any constraints on galactic properties in general from the microlensing data ( except for the existence of the bar ) and in particular on the mass function .",
    "we found a mass function that works along with our other assumptions , but we are unable to assert that it is the right one .",
    "we end by enumerating our conclusions .",
    "the procedure developed here appears to be computationally sound ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mvszcmpre ] and later consistencies ) and provides a convenient framework for rapidly determining the predictions for microlensing surveys of the galaxy .",
    "position dependence of various galactic properties such as stellar velocities is relatively easily incorporated when observations justify such detail .",
    "the sensitivity of the predictions of our overall model to changes in various galactic parameters used in the model , means that microlensing will be a major player in the set of many types of observations that will ultimately constrain the structure , content and dynamics of the galaxy .",
    "there is no motivation for invoking a large population of brown dwarfs to account for the number of short time scale events observed by the macho group .",
    "brown dwarfs might be accommodated by reducing the velocity dispersion , for example , but there appears to be a sharp fall off in the number of brown dwarfs as companions to local solar type stars ( mazeh , goldberg & latham 1998 ) , and there is no apparent theoretical or observational reason for expecting many brown dwarfs in the bulge .",
    "the sensitivity of the microlensing event rates and optical depth to the direction of the line of sight for bar models means it will be a sensitive probe of the star distribution in such models .",
    "the disk stars contribute to a minor fraction of the microlensing events ( figs .",
    "[ fig : efremovals ] and [ fig : tauremovals ] ) .",
    "we obtain a better fit to the macho data by including the nucleus in the zhao ( 1996 ) bulge model , albeit we truncated the singular peak in the density to avoid excessively large optical depths and event rates for lines of sight near the galactic center .",
    "this truncation is probably academic in any case as obscuration increases drastically for lines of sight very close to the galactic center and no data have been taken there .",
    "our model time scale frequency distributions dance around the empirical distribution from the macho observations as various parameters are varied , but we are able to get a very good match to this data from the distributions from our nominal model averaged over the macho field directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : machoave ] ) . about",
    "half of the optical depths for these directions fall within the @xmath3 error bars of the empirical average optical depth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taumacho ] ) , and the mean optical depth is about @xmath3 away from the macho mean .",
    "it is important to remember that although no brown dwarfs are necessary to match the macho data , the number of m stars had to be increased rather drastically above those obtained from recent star counts both locally as in the basu and rana or gould _ et al _ mass functions and in the galactic bulge itself from the holtzman _",
    "et al _ mass function .",
    "\\8 . for our particular model",
    ", the addition of brown dwarfs to the mass function seems to be a detriment rather than an asset in matching the macho data ( figs .",
    "[ fig : efmassfns ] and [ fig : efmassfns2 ] ) .    \\9 . in spite of the success of our nominal model in matching the macho data , uncertainties in all of the galactic parameters and the meagerness of",
    "the published data preclude definitive microlensing constraints on any of them  including the mass function .",
    "this frustration should be diminished as the microlensing data set grows .",
    "in fact , additional existing data may already yield sufficient spatial resolution to constrain the bar shape and orientation  if the set were analyzed and published .",
