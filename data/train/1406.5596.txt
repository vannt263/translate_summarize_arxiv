    "secret sharing schemes are important tool used in security protocols . originally motivated by the problem of secure key storage by shamir @xcite ,",
    "secret sharing schemes have found numerous other applications in cryptography and distributed computing .",
    "threshold cryptography @xcite , access control @xcite , secure multi - party computation @xcite @xcite @xcite , attribute based encryption @xcite @xcite , generalized oblivious transfer @xcite @xcite , visual cryptography @xcite @xmath2 are the significant areas of development using the secret sharing techniques . in secret sharing ,",
    "the secret is divided among @xmath3 participants in such a way that only designated subset of participants can recover the secret , but any subset of participants which is not a designated set can not recover the secret . a set of participants who can recover the secret is called an _ access structure _ or _ authorized set _ , and a set of participants which is not an authorized set",
    "is called an _ unauthorized set _ or _ forbidden set_.",
    "the following are the two fundamental requirements of any secret sharing scheme .    * * * recoverability:**authorized subset of participants should be able to recover the secret by pooling their shares . * * * privacy:**unauthorized subset of participants should not learn any information about the secret .",
    "let @xmath4 be the set of participants and the secret be @xmath5 .",
    "the set of all secret is represented by @xmath6 .",
    "the set of all shares @xmath7 is represented by @xmath8 .",
    "the participants set is partitioned into two classes .    1 .",
    "the class of authorized sets @xmath9 is called the _ access structure . _ 2 .",
    "the class of unauthorized sets @xmath10    let us assume that @xmath11 are all finite sets and there is a probability distribution on @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "we use @xmath12 and @xmath13 to denote the entropy of @xmath6 and @xmath8 respectively . in a secret sharing scheme",
    "there is a special participant called _ dealer _ @xmath14 , who is trusted by everyone .",
    "the dealer chooses a secret @xmath15 and the shares @xmath16 corresponding to the secret is generated .",
    "the shares are then distributed privately to the participants through a secure channel . in the secret reconstruction phase , participants of an access set pool their shares together and",
    "recover the secret .",
    "alternatively participants could give their shares to a combiner to perform the computation for them .",
    "if an unauthorized set of participants pool their shares they can not recover the secret .",
    "thus a secret sharing scheme for the access structure @xmath9 is the collection of two algorithms : + * distribution algorithm*:this algorithm has to be run in a secure environment by a trustworthy party called dealer .",
    "the algorithm uses the function @xmath17 , which for a given secret @xmath15 and a participant @xmath18 , assigns a set of shares from the set @xmath8 that is @xmath19 for @xmath20.@xmath21 * recovery algorithm*:this algorithm has to be executed collectively by cooperating participants or by the combiner , which can be considered as a process embedded in a tamper proof module and all participants have access to it .",
    "the combiner outputs the generated result via secure channels to cooperating participants .",
    "the combiner applies the function , @xmath22 to calculate the secret . for any authorized set of participants",
    "@xmath23 , if @xmath24 .",
    "if the group of participant belongs to an unauthorized set , the combiner fails to compute the secret .",
    "a secret sharing scheme is called perfect if for all sets @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , if participants in @xmath25 pool their shares together they can not reduce their uncertainty about @xmath28 .",
    "that is , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denote the collection of shares of the participants in @xmath25 .",
    "it is known that for a perfect secret sharing scheme @xmath31 . if @xmath32 then the secret sharing scheme is called ideal .",
    "an access structure @xmath33 is _ minimal _ if @xmath34 and @xmath35 implies that @xmath36 . only _ monotone access structure _ is considered for the construction of the scheme in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 implies @xmath35 .",
    "the collection of minimal access sets uniquely determines the access structure .",
    "the access structure is the closure of the minimal access set .",
    "the access structure @xmath9 in terms of minimal access structure is represented by @xmath39 . for an access structure @xmath9 , the family of unauthorized sets @xmath40 has the property that , given an unauthorized set @xmath41 then any subset @xmath42 is also an unauthorized set .",
    "an immediate consequence of this property is that for any access structure @xmath9 , the set of unauthorized sets can be uniquely determined by its _",
    "maximal set_. we use @xmath43 to denote the representation of @xmath44 in terms of maximal set . for all @xmath45 , if @xmath46 , then the access structure corresponds to a @xmath47 threshold scheme . in the @xmath47 threshold scheme @xmath48 or more participant can reconstruct the secret .",
    "section 2 gives an insight into the threshold secret sharing schemes .",
    "secret sharing schemes realizing the general access structures are mentioned in section 3 .",
    "section 4 explores the various multi secret sharing techniques in the literature .",
    "section 5 is the summary where different schemes are compared for their merits and demerits .",
    "section 6 is the conclusion .",
    "development of secret sharing scheme started as a solution to the problem of safeguarding cryptographic keys by distributing the key among @xmath3 participants and @xmath48 or more of the participants can recover it by pooling their shares .",
    "thus the authorized set is any subset of participants containing more than @xmath48 members .",
    "this scheme is denoted as @xmath47 _ threshold scheme_. the notion of a threshold secret sharing scheme is independently proposed by shamir @xcite and blakley @xcite in 1979 . since",
    "then much work has been put into the investigation of such schemes .",
    "linear constructions were most efficient and widely used .",
    "a threshold secret sharing scheme is called _ perfect _ , if less than @xmath48 shares give no information about the secret .",
    "shamir s scheme is perfect while blakley s scheme is non perfect . both the blakley s and the shamir s constructions realize @xmath48-out - of-@xmath3 shared secret schemes . however , their constructions are fundamentally different .",
    "shamir s scheme is based on polynomial interpolation over a finite field .",
    "it uses the fact that we can find a polynomial of degree @xmath49 given @xmath48 data points .",
    "a polynomial @xmath50 , with @xmath51 is set to the secret value and the coefficients @xmath52 to @xmath53 are assigned random values in the field is used for secret sharing . the value @xmath54 is given to the user @xmath55 as secret share .",
    "when @xmath48 out of @xmath3 users come together they can reconstruct the polynomial using lagrange interpolation and hence obtain the secret .",
    "blakley s secret sharing scheme has a different approach and is based on hyperplane geometry . to implement a @xmath47 threshold scheme ,",
    "each of the @xmath3 users is given a hyper - plane equation in a @xmath48 dimensional space over a finite field such that each hyperplane passes through a certain point .",
    "the intersection point of these hyperplanes is the secret .",
    "when @xmath48 users come together , they can solve the system of equations to find the secret .",
    "mceliece and sarwate @xcite made an observation that shamir s scheme is closely related to reed - solomon codes @xcite .",
    "the error correcting capability of this code can be translated into desirable secret sharing properties .",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite realize threshold schemes using linear codes .",
    "massey @xcite introduced the concept of minimal code words and provided that the access structure of a secret sharing scheme based on a @xmath56 $ ] linear code is determined by the minimal codewords of the dual code .",
    "number theoretic concepts are also introduced for threshold secret sharing scheme .",
    "the mingotee scheme @xcite is based on modulo arithmetic and _ chinese remainder theorem ( crt)_. a special sequence of integers called mingotte sequence is used here .",
    "the shares are generated using this sequence .",
    "the secret is reconstructed by solving the set of congruence equation using crt .",
    "the mingotte s scheme is not perfect .",
    "a perfect scheme based on crt is proposed by asmuth and bloom @xcite .",
    "they also uses a special sequence of pairwise coprime positive integers .",
    "kothari @xcite gave a generalized threshold scheme .",
    "a secret is represented by a scalar and a linear variety is chosen to conceal the secret . a linear function known to all trustees",
    "is chosen and is fixed in the beginning , which is used to reveal the secret from the linear variety .",
    "the @xmath3 shadows are hyperplanes containing the liner variety .",
    "moreover the hyperplanes are chosen to satisfy the condition that , the intersection of less than @xmath48 of them results in a linear variety which projects uniformly over the scalar field by the linear functional used for revealing the secret . the number @xmath48 is called the threshold .",
    "thus as more shadows are known more information is revealed about the linear variety used to keep the secret , however no information is revealed until the threshold number of shadows are known .",
    "he had shown that blakley s scheme and karin s scheme are equivalent and provided algorithms to convert one scheme to another .",
    "he also stated that the schemes are all specialization of generalized linear threshold scheme .",
    "brickell@xcite also give a generalized notion of shamir and blackley s schemes using vector spaces .",
    "researchers have investigated @xmath57 threshold secret sharing extensively .",
    "threshold schemes that can handle more complex access structures have been described by simmons @xcite like weighted threshold schemes , hierarchical scheme , compartmental secret sharing @xmath1 .",
    "they were found a wide range of useful applications .",
    "et al . , _ @xcite in 2009 , developed threshold schemes based on visual cryptography .",
    "in the previous section , we mentioned that any @xmath48 of the @xmath3 participants should be able to determine the secret .",
    "a more general situation is to specify exactly which subsets of participants should be able to determine the secret and which subset should not . in this section",
    "we give the secret sharing constructions based on generalized access structure .",
    "shamir @xcite discussed the case of sharing a secret between the executives of a company such that the secret can be recovered by any three executives , or by any executive and any vice - president , or by the president alone .",
    "this is an example of _ hierarchical secret sharing _ scheme .",
    "the shamir s solution for this case is based on an ordinary @xmath58 threshold secret sharing scheme .",
    "thus , the president receives three shares , each vice - president receives two shares and finally every executive receives a single share .",
    "the above idea leads to the so - called weighted(or multiple shares based ) threshold secret sharing schemes . in these schemes ,",
    "the shares are pairwise disjoint sets of shares provided by an ordinary threshold secret sharing scheme .",
    "benaloh and leichter have proven in @xcite that there are access structures that can not be realized using such scheme .",
    "several researchers address this problem and introduced secret sharing schemes realizing the general access structure .",
    "the most effecient and easy to implement scheme was ito , saito , nishizeki s @xcite construction .",
    "it is based on shamir s scheme .",
    "the idea is to distribute shares to each authorized set of participants using multiple assignment scheme , where more than one share is assigned to a participant , if he belongs to more than one minimal authorized subset .",
    "a simple scheme is mentioned by beimel @xcite , in which the secret @xmath59 and let @xmath60 be any monotone access structure .",
    "the dealer shares the secret independently for each authorized set @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "the dealer chooses @xmath63 random bits @xmath64 .",
    "compute @xmath65 , and the dealer distributes share @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "for each set @xmath68 , the random bits are chosen independently and each set in @xmath9 can reconstruct the secret by computing the exclusive - or of the bits given to the set .",
    "the unauthorized set can not do so .",
    "the disadvantage with multiple share assignment scheme is that the share size depends on the number of authorized set that contain @xmath69 .",
    "a simple optimization is to share the secret @xmath28 only for minimal authorized sets .",
    "still this scheme is inefficient for access structures in which the number of minimal set is big ( eg:@xmath70 scheme ) .",
    "the share size grows exponentially in this case .",
    "benalohand leichter @xcite developed a secret sharing scheme for an access structure based on monotone formula .",
    "this generalizes the multiple assignment scheme of ito , saito and nishizeki @xcite .",
    "the idea is to translate the monotone access structure into a monotone formula .",
    "each variable in the formula is associated with a trustee in @xmath71 and the value of the formula is _ true _ if and only if the set of variables which are _ true _ corresponds to a subset of @xmath71 which is in the access structure .",
    "this formula is then used as a template to describe how a secret is to be divided into shares .",
    "the monotone function contains only and and or operator . to divide a secret @xmath28 into shares such that @xmath72 can reconstruct @xmath28 . in this case @xmath73 and @xmath74 can simply both be given values @xmath28 . if @xmath75 need to reconstruct secret , then @xmath73 can be given value @xmath76 and @xmath74 can be given value @xmath77 such that @xmath78,@xmath79 , @xmath76 is chosen randomly from @xmath80 , @xmath77 is @xmath81 .",
    "more exactly , for a monotone authorized access structure @xmath9 of size @xmath82 they defined the set @xmath83 as the set of formula on a set of variables @xmath84 such that for every @xmath85 the interpretation of @xmath86 with respect to an assignation of the variables is true if and only if the true variables correspond to a set @xmath87 .",
    "they have remarked that such formula can be used as templates for describing how a secret can be shared with respect to the given access structure . because the formula can be expressed using only ` @xmath88 ' operators and ` @xmath89 ' operators , it is sufficient to indicate how to `` split '' the secret across these operators .",
    "brickell @xcite developed some ideal schemes for generalized access structure using vector spaces .",
    "stinson @xcite introduced a monotone circuit construction based on monotone formula and also the construction based on public distribution rules .",
    "benaloh s scheme was generalized by karchmer and wigderson @xcite , who showed that if an access structure can be described by a small monotone span program then it has an efficient scheme .",
    "cumulative schemes were first introduced by ito _",
    "et al . , _ @xcite and then used by several authors to construct a general scheme for arbitrary access structures .",
    "simmons @xcite proposed cumulative map , jackson @xcite proposed a notion of cumulative array .",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite introduced simpler and more efficient scheme and also introduced capabilities to detect cheaters .",
    "generalized cumulative arrays in secret sharing is introduced by long @xcite .",
    "there are several situations in which more than one secret is to be shared among participants . as an example , consider the following situation , described by simmon @xcite .",
    "there is a missile battery and not all of the missiles have the same launch enable code .",
    "we have to devise a scheme which will allow any selected subset of users to enable different launch code .",
    "the problem is to devise a scheme which will allow any one , or any selected subset , of the launch enable codes to be activated in this scheme .",
    "this problem could be trivially solved by realizing different secret sharing schemes , one for each of the launch enable codes , but this solution is clearly unacceptable since each participant should remember too much information .",
    "what is really needed is an algorithm such that the same pieces of private information could be used to recover different secrets .",
    "one common drawback of all secret sharing scheme is that , they are one - time schemes . that is once a qualified group of participants reconstructs the secret @xmath5 by pooling their shares , both the secret @xmath5 and all the shares become known to everyone , and there is no further secret . in other words , the share kept by each participant can be used to reconstruct only one secret .",
    "karnin , greene and hellman @xcite in 1983 mentioned the multiple secret sharing scheme where threshold number of users can reconstruct multiple secrets at the same time .",
    "alternatively the scheme can be used to share a large secret by splitting it into smaller shares .",
    "et al . , _ @xcite , in 1992 used a technique in which the polynomial - based single secret sharing is replaced with a scheme where multiple secrets are kept hidden in a single polynomial .",
    "they also considered the case of dependent secrets in which the amount of information distributed to any participant is less than the information distributed with independent schemes .",
    "both the schemes are not perfect .",
    "they are also one time threshold schemes .",
    "that is , the shares can not be reused .",
    "et al . , _ @xcite , in 1993 considered the case in which @xmath90 secrets are shared among participants in a single access structure @xmath9 in such a way that any qualified set of participants can reconstruct the secret . but any unqualified set of participants knowing the value of number of secrets might determine some ( possibly no ) information on other secrets .",
    "et al . , _ @xcite ,",
    "in 1994 considered the situation in which there is a secret @xmath91 associated with each subset @xmath0 of participants and @xmath91 can be reconstructed by any group of @xmath48 participants in @xmath0 @xmath92 . that is each subset of @xmath0 participants",
    "is associated with a secret which is protected by a @xmath93)-threshold access structure .",
    "these schemes are called multi - secret threshold schemes .",
    "they came up with a combinatorial model and optimum threshold multi secret sharing scheme .",
    "information theoretic model similar to threshold scheme is also proposed for multi - secret sharing .",
    "they have generalized and classified the multi - secret sharing scheme based on the following facts .",
    "* should all the secrets be available for potential reconstruction during the lifetime of the scheme , or should the access of secrets be further controlled by enabling the reconstruction of a particular secret only after extra information has been broadcast to the participants .",
    "* whether the scheme can be used just once to enable the secrets or should the scheme be designed to enable multiple use . * if the scheme is used more than once then the reconstructed secret or shares of the participants is known to all other participants or it is known to only the authorized set . *",
    "the access structure is generalized or threshold in nature .    in 1994",
    "he and dawson @xcite proposed the general implementation of multistage secret sharing .",
    "the proposed scheme allows many secrets to be shared in such a way that all secrets can be reconstructed separately .",
    "the implementation uses shamir s threshold scheme and assumes the existence of a one way function which is hard to invert .",
    "the public shift technique is used here .",
    "a @xmath49 degree polynomial @xmath94 is constructed first , as in shamir s scheme .",
    "the public shift values are @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath97 s are the secret shares of the participant .",
    "@xmath97 s are then send to the participants secretly . for sharing the next secret ,",
    "@xmath98 is used , where @xmath99 is the one way function .",
    "the secrets are reconstructed in particular order , stage by stage and also this scheme needs @xmath100 public values corresponds to the @xmath0 secrets .",
    "the advantage is that each participant has to keep only one secret element and is of the same size as any shared secret . in 1995",
    "harn @xcite shows an alternative implementation of multi stage secret sharing which requires only @xmath101 public values .",
    "the implementation become very attractive , especially when the threshold value @xmath48 is very close to the number of participants @xmath3 . in this scheme an @xmath102 degree polynomial @xmath94 is evaluated at @xmath103 points and are made public .",
    "any @xmath48 participants can combine their shares with the @xmath103 public shares to interpolate the degree @xmath102 polynomial .",
    "multiple secrets are shared with the help of one way function as in he and dawson scheme .",
    "the desirable properties of a particular scheme depends on both the requirements of the application and also the implementation .",
    "several multi secret threshold schemes are developed by the research community . in this survey",
    "we only explore some of the important constructions of multi - secret sharing scheme realizing general access structure .",
    "a computationally secure secret sharing scheme with general access structure , where all shares are as short as the secret is proposed by christian cachin @xcite in 1995 .",
    "the scheme also provides capability to share multiple secrets and to dynamically add participants on - line without having to redistribute new shares secretly to the current participants .",
    "these capabilities are achieved by storing additional authentic information in a publicly accessible place which is called a noticeboard or bulletin board .",
    "this information can be broadcast to the participants over a public channel .",
    "the protocol gains its security from any one - way function.the construction has the following properties .    *",
    "all shares must be transmitted and stored secretly once for every participants and are as short as the secret . *",
    "multiple secret can be shared with different access structure requiring only one share per participant for all secrets .",
    "* provides the ability for the dealer to change the secret after the shares have been distributed .",
    "* the dealer can distribute the shares on - line . when a new participant is added and the access structure is changed , already distributed shares remain valid .",
    "shares must be secretly send to the new participants and the publicly readable information has to be changed .",
