    "it is known since taylor s seminal work @xcite that tracers transported by a turbulent flow approach a diffuse behavior on time scales much longer than the lagrangian correlation time of the flow .",
    "these ideas are now commonly used in applications , as for instance in air quality control , to model effective mixing properties in terms of an eddy diffusivity .",
    "such models give a good handle on long - term averages and are successfully used to determine , for instance , possible health hazards linked to a long exposure downstream a pollutant source .",
    "however they are unable to capture strong local fluctuations stemming from the complex structure of the turbulent flow .",
    "such events can not be directly predicted from the averaged concentration field as they relate to higher - order moments .",
    "accessing these fluctuations is crucial in order to quantify for instance the likeliness of finding a local concentration exceeding a high threshold .",
    "second - order statistics , such as the variance of a transported concentration field and more generally the spatial correlation of a passive scalar , are statistically related to the relative motion of tracers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem consists then in investigating the time evolution of the separation @xmath0 between two lagrangian trajectories . in turbulence ,",
    "the distance @xmath1 follows richardson  obukhov superdiffusive law @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mean rate of kinetic energy dissipation .",
    "the long - term behavior is thus becoming independent of the initial separation @xmath4 , whence the designation of _ explosive _ pair separation . in his original arguments to derive this law , richardson @xcite assumed that pair separation is a diffusion process with a scale dependent diffusivity @xmath5 .",

    "this implies that , at large times , @xmath11 and the transition probability reads @xmath12 ,    \\label{eq : pdf_richardson}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a positive constant .",
    "the considerations leading to the fokker ",
    "planck equation ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) rely on the use of a central - limit theorem for @xmath14 and thus on the hypothesis that the velocity difference between the two tracers is correlated over timescales much smaller than those of interest .",
    "as noticed for instance in @xcite , such an hypothesis can hardly be invoked .",
    "it is indeed known in turbulence that eddies of size @xmath9 are correlated over a time of the order of their turnover time @xmath15 .",
    "hence for separations that grow like @xmath16 , one has @xmath17 , so that the dominant flow structures in the separation dynamics are in principle correlated over timescales of the order of the observation time . despite such shortcomings , the diffusive approach proposed by richardson and in particular the explicit form ( [ eq : pdf_richardson ] ) for the transition probability density have proven being relevant in some asymptotics  @xcite .",
    "also , much work on relative dispersion has used it as a basis .",
    "for instance , improvements of ( [ eq : pdf_richardson ] ) were proposed using modified versions of the eddy diffusivity @xmath18 , adding a time dependence @xcite or , more recently , including finite reynolds number effects @xcite .",
    "all of these improvements strongly alter the functional form of the large-@xmath9 tail of the transition probability density .",
    "nevertheless , the physical mechanisms leading to the de - correlation of velocity differences and to models based on eddy diffusivity are still unclear and many questions remain open . for instance , the speed of convergence to the richardson ",
    "obukhov law and the form of subleading terms are still not known .",
    "the first work dealing with the way pair separations converge to a superdiffusive behavior is due to batchelor @xcite .",
    "he argued that the explosive @xmath19 law is preceded by a ballistic phase during which the tracers keep their initial velocity and separate linearly in time , i.e.  @xmath20 , up to a time @xmath21 , which is equal to the eddy turnover time associated to the initial separation .",
    "this first regime where velocity remains strongly correlated can clearly not be described by eddy - diffusivity approaches .",
    "various stochastic models have been designed to catch the two regimes .",
    "most of them are based on the observation that the acceleration difference between the two tracers is shortly correlated and do not assume that velocity differences get uncorrelated . the pair separation and the velocity difference",
    "can then be approximated as coupled markovian diffusive processes ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the usual path for designing such models requires imposing some constraints on the drift and the diffusion terms .",
    "thomson @xcite argued that they should satisfy the well - mixed condition : when averaging over uniformly separated pairs inside the whole inertial range , the statistics of velocity differences between the two tracers has to recover eulerian two - point statistics .",
    "definitively devising an admissible model requires an input from eulerian statistics @xcite .",
    "it is known in turbulence that the distribution of velocity differences is neither self - similar nor gaussian ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such models become thus so complicated that they can hardly be used to improve the understanding of the underlying phenomenology and , at the same time , they are not easily amenable for an analytical treatment .",
    "the goal of the present work is to give some new phenomenological understanding of the problem of turbulent relative dispersion . for this , we make use of large - scale direct numerical simulations and essentially focus our study on the role of violent events leading to strong fluctuations . to give grounds to possible improvements of models for relative dispersion ,",
    "we introduce some new observables , measure their behavior , and interpret the results mostly in terms of geometrical arguments .",

    "the aim is to provide a first insight on the numerical simulations that we have used and on the typical values of the timescales and lengthscales that are used throughout this paper .",
    "one of the major difficulties encountered when attacking numerically the problem of turbulent explosive separation is that it requires a huge timescale separation . indeed , to observe richardson ",

    "we should thus have @xmath29 . to give a concrete idea ,",

    ", we have used the cumulative probability @xmath251 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponent ]  ( a ) for @xmath259 ) to obtain @xmath262 through a fit of its local slope .",
    "the resulting measurements are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponent ]  ( b ) as a function of time . up to the large error bars due to a lack of statistics",
    ", one observes that the timescale @xmath67 is again relevant to describe both the initial dynamics and the convergence to an asymptotic regime . at small times",
    "@xmath94 , the exponent @xmath241 takes large positive values , which , as explained above , are due to the initial conditioning @xmath263 . at time @xmath264",
    ", the exponent becomes smaller than 3 . for @xmath85",
    ", it asymptotically approaches the value @xmath243 , so that data give evidence in favor of the argument exposed above .",
    "interestingly , for small initial separations @xmath265 , the limit is reached from below and preceded by a minimum of @xmath241 .",
    "this means that for such intermediate times , the pinching ( or equivalently the stretching ) of the sphere is so strong that the intersection of the latter with spheres of radius @xmath9 defines a fractal object that is more concentrated than a surface .",
    "such a temporary singular behavior is certainly related to the presence of tails fatter than exponential at very large distances .",
    "in this paper we have confirmed and extended previous results of @xcite on the timescales of convergence of turbulent pair dispersion to an asymptotic regime .",
    "we have seen that low and medium - order moments of the particle separation approach an asymptotic regime on times of the order of @xmath266 , where @xmath133 denotes the ( absolute value ) structure function associated to the initial separation @xmath26 and @xmath3 is the mean rate of kinetic energy dissipation .",
    "this timescale has been shown to be relevant to describe also the initial kinematic change of sign of the longitudinal velocity difference @xmath148 and the tails of the distance distribution at small values .",
    "however , we have seen that @xmath67 is not relevant to describe the convergence of the velocity difference statistics to an asymptotic regime .",
    "we have observed that up to the largest time , the skewness , the flatness , and more generally the shape of the velocity difference distribution still depend on the initial separation , even when time is rescaled by @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to a behavior that is by far more intermittent than that of separations .",
    "also we obtained evidence that the far tail distribution of separation is also keeping a nontrivial memory on @xmath26 up to the largest times . throughout this paper",
    ", we made an important use of geometrical considerations to explain phenomenologically the statistical events leading to extreme fluctuations .",
    "in particular , we argued and obtained numerical evidence that , at sufficiently large times , the probability distribution @xmath267 of inter - tracer distances is @xmath268 for @xmath254 and decays as @xmath269 when @xmath270 .",
    "these two observations strongly contradicts richardson s eddy diffusivity approach , which seems nevertheless to give a good approximation of the core of the distribution .",
    "finally , we obtained a striking result concerning mixed distance and velocity statistics .",
    "we indeed found that the distribution of a `` local dissipation '' , defined as @xmath195 ^ 3/|{\\bm r}|$ ] , attains relatively quickly a scaling regime that is independent of both @xmath26 and time .",
    "this behavior , which , to our knowledge , has never been observed before , gives very strong constraints for the development and validation of stochastic markovian models for turbulent relative dispersion .",
    "a central question that we raised concerns the physical mechanisms leading to this fast convergence of the `` local dissipation '' to a statistically stationary behavior . at the moment",
    ", an even phenomenological explanation is still missing .",
    "we have understood that kinematic considerations can be used to explain why @xmath192",
    "^ 3/|{\\bm r}|\\rangle$ ] , which is initially negative , becomes quickly positive .",
    "this is due to the fact that initially approaching trajectories will always eventually separate .",
    "however , there is no clear idea of why this average should converge to a time - independent value .",
    "possible ideas could consist in finding other mixed moments that are strictly ( and not asymptotically ) conserved by the two - point turbulent lagrangian flow .",
    "such considerations are kept for future work .",
    "finally , another possible extension of the current study is to apply the developed understanding of the geometry of relative dispersion to more complicated turbulent transport situations involving more than two trajectories .",
    "this is for instance the case for the forward - in - time dynamics of triangles or tetrahedrons studied in @xcite .",
    "the quality of today numerical data would be very useful to revisit such questions with an emphasize on extreme events .",
    "another situation that is much closer to applications is that of the transport by turbulence of pollutant patches .",
    "we have seen in the current study that relative dispersion relates to the distorsion of a sphere by the lagrangian flow .",
    "we related the small - scale behavior of separation statistics to the fractal dimension of this object .",
    "such geometrical considerations could be generalized to understand and quantify the large concentration fluctuations in the dispersion of a pollutant spot .",
