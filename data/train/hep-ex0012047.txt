    "the next generation of linear colliders jlc  @xcite , nlc  @xcite , tesla  @xcite are being developed at the energies from 100 gev to about 1 tev . in this energy region ,  linear colliders are the best machines for study of elementary particles ; they can have a sufficient luminosity , good monochromaticity , and rather low backgrounds .",
    "though already at these energies attainable  luminosity is determined by collision effects . in order to reduce beamstrahlung during the beam collisions",
    "very flat beams should be used with a vertical size of several nm . to obtain a sufficient luminosity one has to increase average beam current , as a result of which the total power consumption approaches 100 mw .    at multi - tev",
    "linear colliders , such as clic  @xcite , all problems are much more severe .",
    "the required luminosity should vary proportionally to @xmath1 ( as soon as cross sections @xmath2 ) . to get a sufficient luminosity at a reasonable beam power one has to further decrease beam sizes and admit larger energy spread due to beamstrahlung , and increase total power consumption .",
    "so , the problem of multi - tev  colliders is not just the acceleration of beams up to a high energy , besides there are many other problems caused by collisions effects . as a result ,",
    "the maximum energy of linear colliders ( with a reasonable luminosity ) is about 2e @xmath3 5 tev , namely such as is considered in the clic project .",
    "photon colliders  @xcite are based on the compton scattering of laser light on high energy electrons .",
    "this is only possible at linear colliders where the beams are used only once .",
    "photons are neutral particles therefore there is no beamstrahlung nor beam instabilities .",
    "so , at first sight , it seems that in  colliders can be optimized completely differently and perhaps , in  mode of operation , linear colliders can reach higher energies .    in this paper",
    "i will try to give answers these questions and also consider the problem of lasers for multi - tev photon colliders .",
    "consideration of the general principles of photon colliders and the present status can be found elsewhere  @xcite . though the present paper focuses on problems of multi - tev colliders the results are valid and useful for all energies .",
    "at multi - tev energies there are several complications connected with the conversion of electrons to high energy photons :    1 .   the optimum laser wave length increases proportionally to the electron energy ; 2 .",
    "nonlinear effects in the compton scattering become more important ; 3 .   due to",
    "nonlinear effects the required flash energy is higher ; 4 .",
    "it is not so clear as to what kind of laser can be used .",
    "the maximum energy of the scattered photons is @xcite @xmath4 \\left[\\frac{\\omega_0}{ev}\\right ] , \\label{omegam}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the electron energy , @xmath6 the energy of the laser photon , see fig.[ggcol]a .",
    "the compton cross section depends on the longitudinal electron polarization @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and the circular polarization of laser photons @xmath9 @xmath10 expressions for these cross sections can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of the scattered photons also depends on the product @xmath11 . a typical spectrum of scattered photons for @xmath12 is shown in fig.[spectra ] .",
    "one can see that in the case @xmath13 ( curve a ) the energy spectrum has a high energy peak at the maximum energy , while in the case @xmath14 ( curve b ) the distribution is flat and even approaches to zero at the maximum energies .    with increasing @xmath15 the spectrum corresponding to @xmath16 becomes narrower , while the spectrum for @xmath14 remains quite wide , though the fraction of photons in the high energy part increases : at @xmath12 about half of the photons have energy above @xmath17 , while at @xmath18 half of the photons have energy above @xmath19 .",
    "corresponding graphs for large @xmath15 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite in these proceedings .",
    "typical curves for polarization of the scattered photons for @xmath12 are shown in fig.[polarization ] .",
    "for further discussion the following features are important : in both cases a ) and c ) ( same as in the previous figure ) the polarization of the highest energy photons ( @xmath20 ) is 100% and opposite to the polarization of the laser photons .",
    "however , for the case a ) ( @xmath21 ) most of high energy photons ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) have the polarization @xmath22 , while for the case c ) ( @xmath14 ) only very small number of photons with @xmath23 have @xmath22 , while most of photons have the opposite polarization @xmath24 .",
    "dependence of the compton cross section on @xmath15 for two cases of polarization is shown in fig.[crosssection ] in units of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 cm is the classical radius of the electron .",
    "note , in this section we only consider the case of the _ linear _ compton effect , when only one laser photon is scattered from an electron . in the next section",
    ", we note that for multi - tev photon colliders nonlinear effects ( simultaneous interaction of the electron with several laser photons ) are very important .    with an increase in @xmath15",
    "the energy of the back - scattered photons grows and the energy spectrum becomes narrower , however , at @xmath27 the high energy photons may be lost due to creation of  pairs in the collisions with laser photons  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for  production in a two - photon collision is given by  @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29,\\ ] ] @xmath30 \\label{sigmae+e-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 or @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are photon helicities .",
    "the ratio @xmath34 is shown in fig.[ratio ] . calculating this ratio we took @xmath35 for @xmath13 and @xmath36 for @xmath14 (",
    "this was explained earlier ) .",
    "creation of high energy photons in the conversion region and its conversion to  pairs is described by the corresponding kinetic equation  @xcite .",
    "the maximum yield of the high energy photons from the conversion region ( under the assumption that all photons have energy close to @xmath37 ) is equal to @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "dependence of the maximum conversion coefficient on @xmath15 is shown in fig.[kmax ] . for @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( in principle ) , though it would be more reasonable to assume the thickness of the laser target to be equal to one collision length , this gives @xmath42 . for @xmath18 ( @xmath43 tev , @xmath44 )",
    "@xmath45 is equal to 0.425 ( 0.187 ) for @xmath14 @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the  luminosity is proportional to @xmath47 , therefore , at @xmath18 it will be lower than at @xmath48 by a factor of 2.2 ( 11.4 ) , for the two cases , respectively .",
    "we see that the reduction of the luminosity for the case @xmath49 is not dramatic and for multi - tev photon colliders one can use lasers with @xmath50 , which are optimal for @xmath51 gev ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "so , there are two possibilities for multi - tev photon colliders :    \\1 ) @xmath52 ( @xmath53 $ ] ) , @xmath13 .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath54 , @xmath14 , @xmath55    note , that all this is valid only in the case of linear compton scattering .",
    "below we will see that , in the second case , the picture is more complicated due to nonlinear effects in a strong field of the laser wave .",
    "the field in the laser wave at the conversion region is very strong , so that the electron ( or high energy photon ) can interact simultaneously with several laser photons .",
    "these nonlinear effects are characterized by the parameter  @xcite    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the density of laser photons . at @xmath58",
    "the electron is scattered on one laser photon , while at @xmath59  on several .",
    "nonlinear effects in compton scattering at photon colliders are considered in detail in ref.@xcite in these proceedings .",
    "shortly , with grows of @xmath60 the compton spectrum becomes wider and is shifted to lower energies .",
    "evolution of   luminosity distributions with the increase of @xmath60 at @xmath12 and @xmath13 is shown in fig.[lm48_2ta ] from ref .",
    "one can see the shape of the luminosity spectra are still acceptable up to @xmath61 . for @xmath62 and @xmath14 ( see figs in ref.@xcite the spectrum does not change too much up to @xmath63 .",
    "sensitivity of the compton spectrum to the nonlinear effects can be estimated as following .",
    "due to transverse motion in the electromagnetic wave the electron has the effective mass @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "as a result the maximum energy of the scattered photons is decreased @xmath65 the relative shift of @xmath37 @xmath66 is smaller for larger @xmath15 .    beside worsening of the luminosity spectrum ,",
    "large @xmath60 also leads to decrease of the polarization in the maximum of the luminosity spectrum . partially ,",
    "this is connected with the fact that photons of the same energy can be produced in the region with high or low @xmath60 . in the later case",
    ", the polarization will be lower , because the ratio @xmath67 is lower while the polarization is high only for @xmath68 close to @xmath37 .",
    "one of the main practical consequences of the nonlinear effects is the increase of the required laser flash energy .",
    "this problem is considered in the next section .",
    "the collision probability of an electron with laser photons in the scheme shown in fig.[ggcol ] can be estimated as follows @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the density of laser photons at the focal point , @xmath71 is the r.m.s .",
    "transverse size of the laser beam in the conversion region ( it is assumed to be constant ) , @xmath72 is the collisions angle .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "beam size can be expressed via the beam divergence @xmath73 ( this follows from the heisenberg uncertainty principle : @xmath74 ) . to confine a gaussian laser beam",
    ",   the collision angle @xmath72 should be several times larger than the beam divergence @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( mirrors cover @xmath77 of the gaussian beam ) .",
    "substituting @xmath71 from ( [ theta ] ) and @xmath70 from ( [ xi^2 ] ) into ( [ p1 ] ) we get the collision probability @xmath78 this is a useful relation between the conversion probability , angular size of the focusing system ( @xmath79 ) and parameter @xmath60 . substituting ( [ theta ] ) to ( [ p2 ] )",
    "we get the radius of the laser beam @xmath80    the distribution of photons in a gaussian beam with uniform longitudinal density is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the bunch length . hence , for a round beam @xmath83 , where @xmath70 is the photon density at the focal point , which can be expressed via the parameter @xmath60 using eq.([xi^2 ] ) .",
    "the laser flash energy @xmath84 where the length of the laser bunch follows from the requirements that laser photons should be present in the conversion region all the time until an electron bunch crosses the region @xmath85 , this gives @xmath86 substituting ( [ xi^2],[sigmax2],[le ] ) to ( [ a1 ] ) we get the required laser energy @xmath87 .",

    "we will use these numbers for further estimations .",
    "the first term in eqs.[a2],[a3 ] is some minimum flash energy determined by the diffraction of laser beams , the second term is due to the nonlinear effects ( when the maximum value of the parameter @xmath60 is fixed ) . with the increase of the electron beam energy the second term becomes more important for three reasons : 1 ) if @xmath91const , then @xmath92 , 2 ) if @xmath93 const , then @xmath94 and the ratio @xmath95 decreases ( this increases the first term as well ) , 3 ) the electron bunch length is smaller for accelerators with higher acceleration gradient .",
    "so , to have a reasonable laser flash energy at multi - tev photon colliders one has to increase the value of the parameter @xmath60 , this leads to a worsening of the luminosity spectrum . shows how this problem can be overcome . ]    the required flash energy and contribution of each term for three cases are given in table [ tflash ] .",
    "[ tflash ]    here , in the line @xmath96 the second number after `` @xmath97 '' is due to nonlinear effects .",
    "let me remind also that in the case c ) the luminosity is lower by a factor of 2.3 than in the case b ) ( for small @xmath60 ) due to  production .",
    "so , in both cases of multi - tev colliders b ) and c ) , the flash energy seems acceptable .",
    "of course , in the case b ) it is better to have @xmath98 but in this case the flash energy would be too large , about 25 j.    one more remark concerning the case c ) .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath99 , but , in the case of large @xmath15 and large @xmath60 , the linear theory of  production in collisions between laser and high energy photons may be not be valid due to the coherent   production  @xcite .",
    "this problem needs accurate study , here i would just like to give some comment .",
    "the coherent pair creation in the uniform field starts at @xmath100 ( here @xmath101 is the critical field ) . in the case of the electromagnetic wave @xmath102 . for @xmath18 and @xmath103",
    ", we have @xmath104 .",
    "besides that , in order to consider the coherent  creation in the wave using the same formulas as for the constant field , the formation length for this process should be shorter than the wave length .",
    "this is also fulfilled for @xmath105 .",
    "if that is so , then one can forget about using large @xmath15 and @xmath106 at photon colliders .",
    "but now i am not sure about the accuracy of the numbers in the transition regime considered , it would be worth making an accurate study on this subject .    for convenience , a set of useful approximate formulas for the conversion region expressed via the f - number ( @xmath107 = focal",

    "the input parameter for these equations is @xmath60 .",
    "the third equation gives @xmath107 which should be substituted into the other equations .",
    "obtaining these formulas we assumed that the transverse size of the electron bunch is much smaller than @xmath71 of the laser beam .",
    "this is not always correct . in the scheme with crab crossing ( see fig.[ggcol ] ) , the electron beam is tilted by the angle @xmath113 , that is equivalent to the effective transverse size @xmath114 this is an additional constraint for choice of @xmath107 .",
    "it can be taken into account in the following way .",

    ", eq.[a4]d should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath119 .",
    "in the previous section we have considered the `` usual '' method of laser beam focusing . in this case the laser energy is not effectively used . in order to get high conversion probability at a fixed value of the parameter @xmath60",
    ", the length of the laser target and the diameter of the laser beam should be large enough , most of laser photons do not cross the electron beam .",
    "this is the reason why the required flash energy grows with the increase of the laser wave length .",
    "fortunately , there is a way to overcome this problem , that is _ traveling laser focus _",
    "@xcite , see fig.[travfoc ] . in this scheme ,",
    "the laser beam follows the electron beam .",
    "this can be done using chirped laser pulses ( the wave length changes linearly along the bunch ) .",
    "chirped pulse technique is used for stretching and compression of laser pulses in practically all powerful short - pulse lasers . in order to make a traveling focus",
    "the beam should be pre - focused using elements with some chromaticity , ( fresnel lenses , dispersive lenses , wedges , gratings ) .",
    "the picosecond pulses which are needed for photon colliders have naturally quite broad spectrum and it is not a big problem to vary the focal length on about @xmath120 mm / m @xmath121 and change the direction on @xmath122 .",
    "the optimum diameter of the laser beam should be approximately equal to @xmath123 .",
    "the length of the laser beam can now be arbitrary , it should only be shorter than the distance between the conversion and interaction points which is about @xmath124 or 3.7 mm for @xmath125 tev with @xmath126 nm ( clic ) .",
    "in fact , now the effective thickness of the laser target is equal to the laser bunch length . for obtaining a high conversion probability in such a scheme",
    ", one can use a laser with much smaller flash energy and have much smaller values of the parameter @xmath60 .",

    "is @xmath137 .",
    "the above formulas in this section are valid when @xmath71 , given by eq.[sx2 ] , is larger than @xmath138 . for @xmath88",

    ", one would need 25 j flash energy .",
    "so , the traveling focus is a very attractive solution for one of the most serious problems of multi - tev photon colliders",
    ". certainly , this method of focusing is more complicated , but it can significantly reduce the required flash energy and solve the problem of nonlinear effects .",
    "the chirped pulses needed for this method can be obtained , not only with usual lasers , but also with free electron lasers .",
    "photons are neutral particles , nevertheless there is one collision effect which restricts the  luminosity , that is the coherent pair creation  conversion of high energy photons into  pairs in the field of the opposing electron beam  @xcite .",
    "detailed study of this limitation was given in ref.@xcite . at high energies",
    ", one can not just collide electron beams and convert them to high energy photons , as is possible for low energy photon colliders where  is determined only by the geometric electron - electron luminosity .",
    "let me compare , just for illustration , the probabilities of beamstrahlung and coherent pair creation in a strong electromagnetic field . for @xmath150 ( in  collisions in the clic ( 5 tev ) project @xmath151 ) the probabilities of these processes per unit length",

    "[ lumi ]    in this figures one can see that some curves follow @xmath158 as is expected in the absence of collision effects , while some curves make zigzags due to the coherent pair creation .    for clic ( @xmath159 tev ) with @xmath160",
    "the maximum  luminosity at a reasonable @xmath71 is about @xmath161 .",
    "note , this result very weakly depends on @xmath162 .",
    "so , the luminosity is not too large , only about a factor of two larger than that at the tesla collider at @xmath51 gev  @xcite .    at low energies the coherent pair creation",
    "is considerably reduced ( even suppressed ) due to the beam repulsion  @xcite , see fig.[lumi]a . at high energies",
    "this effects works only for long electron bunches and a small number of particles in the bunch . in fig.[lumi ] for 2e = 5 tev this regime corresponds to the region of very small @xmath71 , where the luminosity is really large .",
    "this regime , with small numbers of particles , high collision rate and very small @xmath71 , is practically impossible to reach in reality .      below",
    "i would like to present a new idea on how the problem of the coherent pair creation can be overcome in photon colliders ( at least in principle ) .",

    "  collisions ) about this ?",
    "one idea is the following .",
    "let us collide electron beams tilted around the collision axis by some relative angle @xmath169 .",
    "having initial displacement each of the electron beams will be split during the collision in two parts , see fig.[suppression ] .",
    "if the transverse deflection during the beam collision , @xmath170 , then the maximum field in the region of high energy photons ( at @xmath171 ) is @xmath172    so , with the decrease of @xmath71 , the  luminosity grows but the field at the interaction region is decreased !    the main problem here is the production of beams with sufficiently small sizes .",
    "the required horizontal beam size is larger for longer beams ( the dependence is between linear and quadratic ) .",
