    "the notion of entropic force has been successfully applied to an increasing number of problems , e.g. , to the calculation of forces acting at the ends of a single gaussian macromolecule  @xcite , the evocation of the geometric features of a surface as creating entropic force fields  @xcite , and the attractive coulomb force between defects of opposite type  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present a new and unusual procedure , using a thermodynamical and mechanical framework , to obtain the ( entropic ) force acting over a particle in a rotating frame in terms of arrangement of particles .",
    "as is known , from liouville theorem it is deduced the existence of seven independent additives integrals : the energy , 3 components of the linear momentum @xmath1 and 3 components of the angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider an isolated macroscopic system @xmath3 composed by n infinitesimal macroscopic subsystems @xmath4 ( with an internal structure possessing a great number of degrees of freedom , allowing the definition of an entropy ) with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , all constituted of particles of a single species of mass @xmath8 .",
    "the internal energy @xmath9 of each subsystem moving with momentum @xmath10 in a galilean frame of reference is given by @xmath11 the entropy of the system is the sum of the entropy of each subsystems ( and function of the their internal energy @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 energy , momentum and angular momentum conservation laws must be verified for a totally isolated system : @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the position vector of the i@xmath19 part of the body ( particle ) relatively to a fixed frame of reference @xmath20 .",
    "it is necessary to find the conditional extremum ; they are set up not for the function @xmath0 itself but rather for the changed function @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "the conditional extremum points are obtained for @xmath25 at thermodynamic equilibrium the total entropy of the body has a maximum taking into consideration the supplementary eqs .",
    "(  [ 2a ] ) , (  [ 2 ] ) and (  [ 3 ] ) .",
    "in the frame of the guiding principle briefly introduced  @xcite , our main goal is to investigate if the information content of the entropy provides a knowledge of the motion of a system .",
    "usually it is used the relationship @xmath26 ( and interpreting here the @xmath27 as an exterior derivative  @xcite ) to obtain ( along a given direction @xmath28 ) @xmath29 on the above expression has its roots a kind of `` entropic force ''  @xcite : @xmath30 we will write , instead of eq .",
    "(  [ fpter ] ) , the first and second principle combined in a differential form ( in cylindrical coordinates ) : @xmath31 it is noteworthy to introduce a factor of @xmath32 , instead of @xmath33 , to each degree of freedom .",
    "this procedure is necessary to eliminate a factor 2 which appear in front of the acceleration term .",
    "it means the scale of the `` thermometer '' is calibrated so as to give a number @xmath32 , _ defined _ by @xmath34 this procedure is necessary to warrant the equipartition theorem  @xcite ( see also sect .",
    "4.1 ) .    further on , for concreteness and simplicity , we consider a moving particle in a plane perpendicular to @xmath35 . in this case",
    "a simple calculation shows that the first term on the ( right hand side ) rhs of eq .",
    "(  [ fpc ] ) leads to @xmath36,\\ ] ] since @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the second term of the rhs , gives @xmath39 and , by the same token , @xmath40    now , remark that using the transport equation @xmath41 we obtain @xmath42    inserting into eq .",
    "(  [ fpc ] ) the previously deduced eqs .",
    "(  [ entr]-  [ relv ] ) , it follows that @xmath43 introducing @xmath44 which can be easily obtained by the outlined procedure and noting that @xmath45 , it is obtained the well known expression for the classical force in a rotating frame @xmath46 + m_i \\dot{\\overrightarrow{v}}_{rel } + m_i ( \\dot{\\overrightarrow{\\omega } } \\times \\overrightarrow{r}_i ) .\\ ] ]    we conclude that the outlined information - theoretic formalism is able to deduce the classical force in a rotating frame ( and hence newton s second law ) ; it makes the prediction that the gradient of entropy when multiplied by @xmath32 gives rise to a macroscopic force .",
    "we see that considering entropy as our primordial concept and with no arbitrary assumptions , it results conceptual and mathematical simplification .    nevertheless , this classical force was obtained in a restrictive context that invokes a particle trajectory along an isentropic regime , obviously a limiting case of the behavior of matter .",
    "a new and very interesting physical situation could be explored considering a dynamical process in which a particle or system of particles evolves in nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "the outlined argument could be reversed and allow the build up of a strategy to relate the force capturing the key properties of statistical ensembles .    for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to introduce the phase space @xmath47 of the system consisting in @xmath48 particles occupying a volume @xmath49 and energy between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( in the microcanonical ensemble ) .",
    "each point on @xmath47 represents a state of the system and the locus of all points in @xmath47 satisfying @xmath52 defines the energy surface of energy @xmath50 .",
    "the volume in @xmath47 space occupied by the microcanonical ensemble is @xmath53 the entropy is defined by  @xcite @xmath54",
    "if a macroscopic system is subject to an entropic force identified as the classical force under thermal equilibrium , it is legitimate to revert the argument and examine whether some microstates provides support for the existence of referenced kinds of forces .",
    "this question is illustrate subsequently .",
    "imagine a particle describing a circular motion at a distance @xmath55 away from the origin of a central force .",
    "the number of configurations in space associated with @xmath55 is @xmath56 . applying eq .",
    "(  [ enforce ] ) the entropic force results to be @xmath57 taking into account the equipartition theorem , @xmath58 , when thermal equilibrium prevails .",
    "hence , the known expression for centrifugal force is found @xmath59    notice that the term of mass was introduced via equipartition theorem . from this",
    "the expression for the force becomes ( unfortunately , the symbol for period and absolute temperature are identical ) @xmath60 recall that according to kepler law , all the planets on the solar system have the same ratio @xmath61 : @xmath62 instead , newton wrote the above equation on the form @xmath63 defining @xmath64 as the gravitational constant .",
    "therefore , the gravitational force is retrieved , but in the present model on the ground of a different viewpoint , giving a new evidence to an old law of physics .",
    "the restoring force in a piece of stretched rubber can be interpreted in terms of a freely orientating gaussian macromolecules containing n segments without volume , each with equal length @xmath65 and remaining at a vector distance @xmath66 .",
    "it can be shown that the number of different molecular configurations which are likely to occur is given by @xmath67 ( here , @xmath68 )  @xcite , from where it is obtained , following the same line of though as in the above example , the elastic force @xmath69 this is the first approximation of a restoring force . normally ,",
    "as resulting from the law of elastic deformation ( hooke s law ) @xmath70 and so the elastic constant should depend on the temperature as well as on structural parameter of the spring .",
    "the principle of maximum entropy and its mathematical model is a promising tool for treatment of new physical problems . here , it was presented an unusual method to show that the classical force acting on a particle of mass @xmath8 in a rotating frame ( and hence newton s second law ) can be obtained making use of the entropy concept .",
    "particle s portrayal in space - time issues from the interrelationship of processes and information .",
    "this procedure could provide a direction toward an amazingly rich subject .",
    "let us reduce our argument to one dimension .",
    "the force acting over a particle is @xmath71 , and so the work done along @xmath55 is @xmath72 . in order",
    "the equipartition theorem be verified this must be equal to @xmath73 and so @xmath74 ."
