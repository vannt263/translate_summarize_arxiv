    "density functional theory ( dft ) has nowadays become the standard tool for the description of ground state properties of such different systems as atoms , molecules , clusters or bulk materials .",
    "part of the success stems from the fact that in the dft electron correlation is in principle exactly covered at the level of an effective one - particle hamiltonian .",
    "difficulties arise however , when the orbital energies obtained from the solution of the kohn - sham ( ks ) eigenvalue problem are interpreted as approximate quasiparticle energies , i.e. , the energies associated with addition or removal of an electron . a well known example is the severe underestimation of the band gap in insulating solids or semiconductor crystals @xcite . the same problem is also present in molecules . although it has been shown that koopmans theorem also holds for the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) in dft @xcite , ionization potentials come out too small in practical calculations .",
    "this fact has been traced back to the wrong asymptotic behavior of common approximate exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals like the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "however , the ks gap can be shown to represent a first - order approximation to optical excitation energies @xcite , and thus the ks gap will be different from the quasiparticle gap even if the exact xc functional is used .    as an alternative to dft , many body perturbation theory in the approximation of hedin",
    "@xcite has been extremely successful in the prediction of quasiparticle spectra . in this so - called gw method the description of the electron - electron interaction is approached in a different way than in dft . while the exchange energy is exactly calculated like in hartree - fock theory , correlation is accounted for by an energy dependent dielectric function which reduces the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the scheme is nearly self - interaction free and provides asymptotically correct potentials .",
    "consequently , the band gap problem of the dft is absent in the gw and also ionization potentials and electron affinities of molecules are computed in good accord with experiment @xcite .    in conjunction with the solution of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite",
    ", the gw approximation can also be used to calculate charge neutral quasiparticle excitations , i.e. , optical spectra . in this context , the time - dependent generalization of dft @xcite , which in principle provides the same information as gw+bs has in practice been found to give inferior results for the absorption spectrum of solids @xcite . also for molecules",
    ", time dependent dft fails in the description of charge transfer excitations @xcite , which was attributed to the locality of common xc - functionals @xcite .",
    "again , gw+bs which contains the correct long range electron - hole interaction should be able to remedy the problem .",
    "another example where dft orbital energies are widely used but lead to problematic results is given by transport calculations in molecular devices . here",
    "the calculated currents differ typically by orders of magnitudes from the experimentally found values @xcite .",
    "since the current - voltage characteristics of such systems depend critically on the homo - lumo gap , a major improvement is expected when gw quasiparticle energies would be used instead of dft orbital energies .",
    "it is clear from the forgoing discussion , that although the gw approximation was developed in the context of solid state theory , its application to molecular systems is becoming more and more important .",
    "in fact , implementations for systems with translational symmetry using plane wave basis sets can directly be applied to finite systems when very large super - cells are used .",
    "nonetheless , the use of localized atomic - like basis sets is clearly more adapted to the problem and such implementations have been utilized quite successful in the past years @xcite . but",
    "even with this improvement , the numerical complexity of the gw equations limits a first principles evaluation to rather small system sizes of tens of atoms .",
    "so applications like transport calculations for molecules , where a sizable amount of the atoms comprising the leads need to be included , or molecular dynamics in the excited state are currently not feasible",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to have an approximate gw scheme which nevertheless captures the essential physics of the underlying theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose such a scheme .    in the past years a number of different approximated gw methods have been introduced and successfully applied @xcite .",
    "the main difference to this earlier work is that we focus on molecular applications with a real space implementation .",
    "furthermore we try to avoid empirical parameters in order to achieve a higher transferability .",
    "like gw calculations usually employ dft energies and wavefunctions as zero order approximations to the quasiparticle quantities , our approach is based on the _ density functional based tight - binding _ ( dftb ) method @xcite , which itself is an approximation to dft . the dftb scheme has been shown to provide reliable results on a variety of systems classes ranging from molecules to solids at a highly reduced numerical cost compared to dft calculations . in section [ meth ] the dftb method",
    "is briefly introduced together with a detailed description of the approximations in the various quantities involved in the gw formalism . the accuracy and main shortcomings of our approach",
    "are then examined in section [ appl ] , where it is applied to a prototype series of @xmath2-bonding molecules , the polyacenes .",
    "the gw method has been extensively discussed in the literature and several reviews are available @xcite .",
    "the main goal is to solve the dyson equation : @xmath3 for the quasiparticle energies @xmath4 and wavefunctions @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the hartree hamiltonian and the so - called self - energy @xmath7 is a nonlocal and energy dependent operator , which accounts for exchange and correlation effects .",
    "it thus can be seen as a replacement for the local exchange - correlation potential @xmath8 in the dft kohn - sham ( ks ) equations . in the gw approximation of hedin",
    ", the self - energy is given as a product of the single - particle greens function @xmath9 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath10 .",
    "as these quantities , as well as the hartree hamiltonian , depend on the quasiparticle wavefunctions , the dyson equation [ eq .  ( [ dyson ] ) ] has to be iterated until self - consistency is achieved .",
    "however , since the dft one - particle wavefunctions are usually very similar to the final quasiparticle ones and moreover self - consistency not necessarily improves the result @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) may be simplified to @xmath11 where @xmath12 are ks orbitals , non - diagonal elements of the dyson hamiltonian in the basis of dft states are neglected and the energy dependence of the self - energy has partially been accounted for by the renormalization constant @xmath13 : @xmath14    in our approach eq .",
    "( [ qpe ] ) is now subjected to further approximations which are presented separately for each term in the following .",
    "as already mentioned , the kohn - sham energies @xmath15 and orbitals are obtained from the dftb method , which has been presented in detail earlier ( for a review see ref .",
    "here we only describe the method to the extent necessary to motivate the remaining approximations in this work . in the dftb",

    "these will be denoted with a corresponding index @xmath23 throughout the paper .    since",
    "atomic orbitals are usually too long ranged to be used directly in a molecular calculation , the atomic dft hamiltonian is augmented with a confining square potential to compress the wavefunction outside of a given radius @xmath24 ( usually twice the covalent radius of the element ) , while ensuring the desired cusp conditions inside @xcite . from the atomic valence",

    "( [ dftbme ] ) contains as usual the kinetic energy , the electron - nuclei attraction and the hartree as well as exchange - correlation potential and depends only on the atomic densities of atoms @xmath22 and @xmath32 .",
    "this means , that besides the crystal field terms also all three - center terms are neglected .",
    "the onsite elements are given as atomic orbital energies obtained from a dft calculation without confining potential to ensure the right dissociation limit .",
    "the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ dftbme ] ) are numerically evaluated and tabulated for varying distance between atoms @xmath22 and @xmath32 .",
    "the second part of the hamiltonian ( [ hmunu ] ) corrects for the fact that the molecular density differs from a simple superposition of atomic densities . in order to estimate this difference , spherical averages over basis functions belonging to one angular momentum shell",
    "are build @xmath33 and used in a mulliken type approximation @xmath34 to represent the molecular density .",
    "the latter is then constructed from point charges @xmath35 an expansion , which despite of its simplicity takes the different spatial localization of e.g @xmath25 and @xmath26-orbitals into account .",
    "based on these considerations , the difference between the true molecular density and superimposed atomic densities can be estimated with net mulliken charges @xmath36 and leads to the correction term @xcite : @xmath37 as shown in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the term @xmath38 describes the interaction of two electrons in the orbitals @xmath39 on atom @xmath22 and @xmath40 on atom @xmath32 , including the effects of exchange and correlation :    @xmath41}{\\delta \\rho({{\\bf r ' } } ) } \\right )    f_{\\bar{\\nu}}({{\\bf r ' } } ) { \\,d{\\bf r } d{\\bf r'}}\\nonumber\\\\\\\\           & \\approx &   \\gamma_{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}}({\\left|{{\\bf r}_a}-{{\\bf r}_b}\\right|},u^h_{\\bar{\\mu}},u^h_{\\bar{\\nu}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and is approximated by considering two limiting cases .",
    "for large distances between the two atoms , the integral ( [ gamma ] ) simplifies to a pure coulomb interaction of two point charges , since the @xmath8 contribution dies off rapidly . for short distance on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) becomes an atomic integral @xmath42 , which can be easily calculated numerically for each element . from these limiting cases",
    "a simple interpolation formula was derived in ref .",

    "the orbital energies @xmath46 needed in eq .",

    "is beneficial to divide the self - energy into two parts as @xmath52 .",
    "the latter term denoted @xmath53 is energy dependent and describes dynamical correlation effects , while the former term @xmath54 provides the major part of the self - energy .",

    "the two - point functions occurring in the gw scheme are represented by s , p , d , and s * orbitals on carbon ( decay constants 0.2 , 0.6 , 1.6 , and 4.0 , i.e. , 40 orbitals per atom ) and on hydrogen , as well ( decay constants 0.25 and 0.7 , i.e. , 20 orbitals per atom ) . in both the dftb and first principles",
    "calculations the lda exchange - correlation functional was used .",
    "the results for benzene and anthracene are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab_vgl ] for a small number of states around the frontier orbitals , according to the energy partioning of eq .",
    "( [ qpe ] ) .",
    "focusing first on the orbital energies , we find a very good agreement between the dftb and the first principles results . this might be surprising considering the limited basis set employed in the former approach . however , the dftb basis consists of optimized atomic orbitals rather than simple gaussian type orbitals .",
    "moreover , the approximations underlying the dftb method seem to be justified due to a stable error cancellation for the @xmath2-orbitals . this hold true to a lesser extent for @xmath101-orbitals , like the @xmath100 state in benzene , where an error up to 0.6 ev is found .",
    "not unexpected , difficulties are also observed for unbound virtual orbitals like the @xmath105 state in benzene , since the description of the continuum is very sensitive to the quality of a finite basis set .",
    "next , we turn to the exchange - correlation energy per orbital . here",
    "we find in comparison with the first principles results , that the dftb values are in general too positive by roughly 10 % .",
    "however , the error even reaches 20 % for the @xmath101-orbitals of benzene .",
    "we attribute this failure to the neglect of crystal field terms in our approach , which is likely to have different effects on orbitals of @xmath101 and @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "in fact , we calculated elements of the type @xmath114 and found , that integrals where a represents a hydrogen atom and b a carbon atom are significantly larger than in the reversed situation or integrals where both a and b stand for carbon atoms . as the latter two types of integrals occur in the calculation of @xmath2-orbitals of the polyacenes , while the first one is important for @xmath101-orbitals , the missing of the crystal field terms is likely to be the source of error here .",
    "considering now the exchange contribution to the self - energy @xmath115 , similar trends are found .",
    "compared to the ab initio results , the dftb values are slightly too positive . since the terms @xmath115 and @xmath116 contribute in eq .",
    "( [ qpe ] ) with opposite signs to the quasiparticle energies , a stable error cancellation is expected .",
    "a larger deviation is found again for the @xmath100 state in benzene , where an error up to 4 ev occurs .",
    "since the exchange integrals depend strongly on the atomic repulsion integrals @xmath117 in our approximation , the error could be reduced by enlarging this parameter for hydrogen without loosing the good performance for the @xmath2-orbitals .",
    "however , we hesitate to treat the @xmath117 values as empirical parameters , because of loss of transferability . instead , one should look for a better approximation of the two - electron integrals . in our approximation",
    "the density @xmath118 is represented by a superposition of spherical charge densities .",
    "consequently , the two - electron integrals are given by simple monopole - monopole interactions , thus neglecting any angular momentum dependence .",
    "a natural next step would be to include higher order terms in a multipole expansion of the density @xmath118 , as it is done in the semiempirical mndo method developed by dewar and thiel @xcite .",
    "next , the final quasiparticle energies are discussed . for the @xmath2-orbitals",
    "the mean deviation of the dftb results from the ab initio values is 0.4 ev , with errors decreasing when the system size is increased .",
    "as could be already expected from the forgoing discussion , the description of @xmath101-orbitals is less satisfactory in the current state of approximations . for the @xmath100 orbital of benzene an error of 1.25 ev",
    "is observed . for the unoccupied levels",
    "however , a very nice agreement between first principles and dftb results is evident . clearly , this is a consequence of an error cancellation between all terms in eq .",
    "( [ qpe ] ) , since e.g. the correlation contribution @xmath119 is systematically underestimated in the dftb scheme .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to investigate if a more advanced treatment of the dyson equation ( [ dyson ] ) leads to better results .",
    "in fact , it has been found that the associated wavefunctions of orbitals which are bound at the dft level of theory , but unbound at the qp level , differ considerably .",
    "this is in contrast to the assumptions made in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ qpe ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) and hence the full qp hamiltonian needs to be diagonalized in these cases and self - consistency with respect to the energy dependence of @xmath7 must be achieved . following this approach earlier investigations of this point reported shifts of the lumo level up to 0.8 ev @xcite .",
    "we also performed such calculations for benzene and found that even for the @xmath103 state the diagonalization changes the qp spectrum by less than 0.01 ev .",
    "this can be understood as as consequence of the minimal basis set we employ , which does not provide enough flexibility to describe the relaxation towards delocalized states .",
    "considering the energy dependence of the self - energy , it can be stated that the approximate treatment of eq .",
    "( [ qpe ] ) using the renormalization constant @xmath120 is quite successful , as we find deviations less than 0.2 ev from the self - consistent solution of the dyson equation .",
    "after validation of the method , we now turn to a first application and analyze in the following the quasiparticle gap @xmath121 as a function of chain length . the first observation which can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ qpgap ] is that the dftb quasiparticle gap is in very nice agreement with the experimental data , which provides some confidence that the general trends we are looking for are correctly described .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ qpgap ] shows that the dft gap is continously decreasing and almost vanishes for n = 19 monomers . as the length increases",
    ", the geometry of the innermost part of the chain resembles more and more that of two coupled polyacetylene chains with equal bond lengths , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ peierls ] .     19 ,",
    "while the peierls ( z)-distorted structure b ) is energetically favoured for n @xmath122 20.[peierls ] ]    the vanishing of the dft gap can thus be understood in terms of a simple particle - in - a - box model .    in stark contrast to the dft gap",
    ", @xmath123 remains finite for increasing chain length and it seems worthwhile to explore the physical origin of this different behaviour in a short digression .",
    "in fact , qp energies can be directly compared to results from photoemission and inverse photoemission measurements , i.e. , they include the effect of an extra particle , while dft is a pure n - electron theory .",
    "delerue et al .",
    "pointed out that for nanocrystals the size dependence of the difference @xmath124 can be estimated on the basis of classical electrostatic arguments @xcite .",
    "considering the interaction between the extra particle and its induced surface charge on the nanocrystal , they arrived at the following formula : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is an effective dielectric constant and @xmath127 is the bulk value of @xmath128 . in order to apply eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) to the polyacenes , we took @xmath129 to be half of the chain length and obtained @xmath126 by averaging the microscopic dielectric function in eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) .",
    "the obtained values increase from 1.72 for n = 1 to 2.14 for n = 19 , which reflects the decreasing band gap .",
    "a fit of eq .",
    "[ pol ] to our qp results is shown in fig .",
    "[ qppol ] and leads to a value of 2.18 ev for @xmath127 .",
    "taking into account that the dft gap is vanishing for @xmath130 , we therefore predict a qp gap of the same value for an infinite chain in the aromatic structure of fig .",
    "[ peierls ] .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ qppol ] further reveals that for n @xmath131 4 the agreement between delerue s formula and the qp results is excellent . the fact that eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) , which was developed in the context of nanocrystals also holds for a quasi one - dimensional system like the polyacenes is quite remarkable .",
    "we now continue the discussion of fig .",
    "[ qpgap ] . between n = 19 and n = 20 homo and lumo cross , which has important implications for the geometrical as well as electronic structure of the system .",
    "remaining in the picture of polyacene as coupled polyacetylene , we observe that the equal c - c bond lengths found for n @xmath132 20 turn into alternating single and double bonds for larger n as depicted in fig .",
    "[ peierls ] , i.e. , the system undergoes a peierls distortion .",
    "in contrast to polyacetylene , where the bond alternation is found to be around 0.08 @xmath133 @xcite , the effect is much weaker here with a value of less than 0.008 @xmath133 .",
    "nevertheless , the dimerization leads like in polyacetylene to an opening of the dft gap , which tends towards a small but finite value for the infinite chain .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ qpgap ] shows that also the quasiparticle gap differs significantly for the distorted and undistorted structure .",
    "this fact could be used in experiment to discriminate between both polymorphs , since we find in line with the mp2 results of cioslowski @xcite , that the two forms are energetically quite close and should therefore coexist in real samples .",
    "we should mention however , that up to now only polyacenes up to n = 6 could be isolated , since larger chains are highly vulnerable to photooxidation @xcite .",
    "the results of this section can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the aromatic from of the infinite polyacene is predicted to be metallic at the dft level of theory , but semiconducting at the gw level .",
    "it thus provides another example besides bulk ge @xcite , where the dft gap is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively wrong .",
    "second , the difference between the dft and qp gap can be understood in terms of the interaction between an extra particle - which is missing in dft - and the charge it induces on the molecular surface .",
    "third , the peierls distorted polyacene conformer is energetically favoured only for very long chains and posesses a qp spectrum which is markedly different from the aromatic form .",
    "this also underlines the usefulness of approximate gw schemes , since in a first principles context the peierls transition found here might not be noticed due to the limited treatable system size @xcite .",
    "in the following , we shortly discuss the numerical efficiency of our approximations .",
    "the method scales like @xmath134 , where n is the number of basis functions and @xmath135 is the number of spherically averaged basisfunctions , that are used in the representation of two - point functions ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "this has to be compared to first principles implementations , which usually scale like @xmath58 .",
    "an additional reduction of computation time is obtained , since we use a minimal basis of optimized atomic orbitals , while in a first principles framework a larger number of primitive orbitals is required . moreover ,",
    "the scaling prefactor is reduced in the dftb scheme , because the necessary integrals are either precalculated and tabulated or approximated by simple functions . as an example , the first principles evaluation of the qp spectrum of anthracene took 170 minutes on a pentium xeon 2.20 ghz processor ( including 120 minutes for the dft part of the calculation ) , compared to less than 1 second on a pentium 4 with 2.40 ghz in our approach .",
    "the largest structure we studied , the n = 30 polyacene with 186 atoms took 10 minutes .",
    "the limiting factor in the calculation of very large systems is therefore not the computation time but rather the memory requirement .",
    "we try to circumvent this problem by computing memory intensive quantities like the overlap charges @xmath137 on - the - fly in a direct way .",
    "in this work we presented a method to perform quasiparticle calculations of molecular systems at a highly reduced computational cost compared to first principles implementations .",
    "the scheme was applied to hydrocarbons , but it can be easily extended to other elements , since all required parameters are calculated from first principles .",
    "the various approximations of the method are intended to be as consistent as possible with the underlying dftb approach to allow for a stable error cancellation . for benzene and anthracene",
    "the results are indeed comparable with higher level calculations with the exception of @xmath101-orbitals . here , ways to overcome the deficiencies were outlined .",
    "nevertheless , we think that the scheme could be useful already at the present stage , since e.g. for optical spectra or in the electronic transport only a few states around the fermi level are active and dominate the physical properties of a system .",
    "the authors would like to thank alessandro pecchia and alessio gagliardi for fruitful discussions related to this work .",
    "further , the ec - diode - network is gratefully acknowledged for financial support and t.a.n is much obliged for using the computer facilities at the german cancer research center in heidelberg .",
