    "the study of wave propagation in disordered lattice and continuum systems has been an important and popular research theme during the past several decades . some of the most prominent recent studies on these topics  @xcite have generalized to weakly nonlinear settings the ideas of p.  w. anderson , who showed theoretically that the diffusion of waves is curtailed in linear random media ( where the randomness arises from defects or impurities ) @xcite .",
    "this interplay between disorder and nonlinearity  which often arises in the presence of lattice discreteness  is of considerable interest to a vast array of ongoing studies , as is evidenced by the recent reviews  @xcite ( see also the numerous references therein ) .",
    "the set of different physical scenarios in which anderson localization has been investigated is staggering : it ranges all the way from electromagnetism @xcite and acoustics @xcite to subjects such as quantum chromodynamics @xcite .    as in the above studies , we are interested in waves in disordered media , but we depart from the earlier work in a very important way : we seek to explore order  disorder transitions with a particular emphasis on _ strongly nonlinear _ media",
    "this contrasts sharply with the linear and weakly nonlinear media in which anderson - like models have traditionally been studied  @xcite .",
    "our approach is motivated predominantly by the strong ( and increasing ) interest in granular crystals  @xcite , which ( as we discuss below ) are very important both for the study of fundamental nonlinear phenomena and for numerous engineering applications .",
    "the examination of disordered systems in general  and of anderson - like phenomena in particular  is a key challenge in the study of nonlinear chains  @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) granular crystals , which consist of closely packed chains of elastically colliding particles , are a paradigmatic system for the investigation of chains of strongly nonlinear oscillators .",
    "their strongly nonlinear dynamic response has inspired numerous studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and discreteness @xcite .",
    "one can construct granular crystals using materials of numerous types and sizes , and their properties are thus extremely tunable , tractable , and flexible @xcite .",
    "this also makes them very well - suited for investigating the effects of structural and material heterogeneities on nonlinear wave dynamics .",
    "studies have examined the role of defects @xcite ( including in experimental settings  @xcite ) , interfaces between two different types of particles @xcite , decorated and/or tapered chains @xcite , chains of diatomic and triatomic units @xcite , and quasiperiodic and random configurations @xcite .",
    "the tunability of granular crystals is valuable not only for fundamental studies of their underlying physics but also in potential engineering applications  including shock and energy absorbing layers @xcite , sound focusing devices and delay lines @xcite , actuators @xcite , vibration absorption layers @xcite , sound scramblers @xcite , and acoustic switches and logic gates  @xcite .",
    "because one can model granular chains as a type of fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattice , they have also been employed in studies of phenomena such as equipartition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    as was illustrated recently , localization in strongly nonlinear systems",
    "can have a fundamentally different character from localization in linear and weakly nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "importantly , one can use the setting of granular crystals to explore a regime ( the so - called `` sonic vacuum '' ) in which no linear counterpart whatsoever exists  @xcite .",
    "it is our goal in the present paper to investigate this regime and nearby regimes in detail and to conduct what we believe is the first systematic study of the differences between localization is linear , weakly nonlinear , and strongly nonlinear systems .",
    "there are numerous types of disorder in a granular chain , and  as we demonstrate in this paper  it matters whether the disorder is uncorrelated ( as in the original anderson model ) or correlated . moreover , there are multiple types of possible correlations in disordered arrangements , and we illustrate using randomized arrangements of dimers ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an example arrangement that was studied in the context of granular crystals ) that seemingly small differences in disorder can have a large impact on the dynamics of wave propagation in strongly nonlinear systems .",
    "moreover , because granular chains are a type of fpu system @xcite  so nonlinearities arise from the potentials that connect adjacent nodes of the lattice  they are fundamentally different from the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) and klein  gordon ( kg ) lattices in which disordered configurations have been extensively studied recently  @xcite .",
    "in fact , as we will demonstrate in the present paper , this difference leads to much more rapid transport in disordered granular chains than what occurs in either nls or kg lattices .",
    "this fundamental difference is one of the main findings of our work : the dynamics of strongly nonlinear , disordered granular crystals includes regimes with superdiffusive transport .",
    "much of the significant volume of work involving nonlinear disordered lattices has focused on the effect of weak nonlinearity on the well - established anderson model  @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable findings in this body of work is the fact that a small amount of nonlinearity in a disordered lattice can induce interaction between anderson modes , which eventually can lead to a subdiffusive delocalization process .",
    "interestingly , this phenomenon emerges in a highly nontrivial way : even when both disorder and nonlinearity separately tend to localize energy , they also `` interfere '' with each other s transport - generation processes and consequently destroy the anderson - localization mechanism . in the context of strongly nonlinear disordered lattices ,",
    "a noteworthy recent effort is that of  @xcite .",
    "the authors of that paper examined disordered lattices  where disorder is introduced via either a linear or a nonlinear on - site term  in which the coupling leads to a strongly nonlinear setting .",
    "they found that initially localized wave packets tend to spread in a subdiffusive way .",
    "however , the spreading in nonlinearly coupled linear oscillators is slow in comparison to purely subdiffusive behavior .",
    "we believe that the subdiffusive behavior in their setting is a consequence of the local potential , because ( as we demonstrate in our paper ) the dynamics tends to be superdiffusive when only strongly nonlinear interactions are present .",
    "the remainder of our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we describe the fundamental equations that characterize a disordered granular chain with hertzian interactions , and we examine different approximations that depend on the amount of precompression . in sec .",
    "[ types ] , we present three different types of disorder and study their correlation properties , which will prove to be of crucial importance for the qualitatively different transport dynamics that can occur . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we briefly discuss the influence of impurities in homogeneous chains on the modes that emerge and on the dynamics more generally . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we present our computational results . we describe the fundamental differences between the different types of disorder , and we discuss the properties of the linear spectrum and the different types of impurity - like modes that appear for each type of disorder .",
    "we also study the transport and localization properties for both linear and nonlinear waves for each type of disorder , and we demonstrate with numerical simulations that localization ( as either breathers or traveling waves ) is no longer possible in a strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "additionally , for strongly precompressed chains and for initially localized displacement excitations , we demonstrate that the second moment exhibits a complicated trend that differs markedly from a power law .",
    "by contrast , we observe superdiffusive transport for all of the other configurations and initial conditions .",
    "we summarize our conclusions and discuss future challenges in sec .",
    "one can describe a 1d crystal of @xmath8 spherical particles as a chain of nonlinear coupled oscillators with hertzian interactions between each pair of particles @xcite .",
    "hertzian forces are applicable to a wide variety of materials  @xcite ( including steel , aluminum , brass , bronze , and many more )",
    ". the equations of motion in this setting are @xmath9_+^{3/2}-      \\frac{a_{n+1}}{m_n}[\\delta_{n+1}+u_n - u_{n+1}]_+^{3/2}\\ , , \\label{hertz}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the displacement of the @xmath11th particle ( where @xmath12 ) measured from its equilibrium position in the initially compressed chain , @xmath13 is the mass of the @xmath11th particle , and @xmath14 is a static displacement for each particle that arises from the static load @xmath15 .",

    "a hertzian interaction between a pair of particles occurs only when they are in contact , so each particle is affected directly only by its nearest neighbors and experiences a force from a neighbor only when it overlaps with it .",
    "this yields the bracket @xmath21_+ = \\left\\ {      \\begin{array}{lcc }          x\\ , , & \\text{if } & x>0\\\\          0\\ , , & \\text{if } & x\\leq0      \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] in eq .  .",

    "\\label{hertz - boundaries2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation   does not include effects from restitution or dissipation , so we assume that we can neglect energy that dissipates into internal degrees of freedom .",
    "most investigations of granular crystals make these assumptions , and a conservative ( and hamiltonian ) description of granular crystals has been extremely useful for numerous comparisons of theoretical and computational results to laboratory experiments @xcite , including in the presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "the proper physical form of dissipation is not known and is still a subject of ongoing debate .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent discussions of dissipative forces in granular crystals .",
    "note additionally that we will not worry about incorporating proper restitution forces , as we conduct our simulations in domains of sizes that ensure that the waves that we examine do not reach the domain boundary during the reported time horizon .    even for homogeneous chains , eq .",
    "includes several interesting features that are not present in other lattice models ( such as the well - known nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) and klein - gordon ( kg ) lattices  @xcite ) . from a structural perspective , the present model is a type of fpu lattice  @xcite .",
    "it exhibits important differences from nls and kg lattices , which typically include both a linear coupling and an on - site nonlinearity . however , there are also respects in which granular chains differ fundamentally from traditional fpu models @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when there is no precompression ( which is known as the `` sonic - vacuum regime ''  @xcite ) , the sound speed goes to @xmath31 and the system becomes purely nonlinear ( i.e. , linearizing it simply yields @xmath31 ) .",
    "this allows solutions like compactons to occur in pde limits of eq .  . additionally , because compactons are not exact solutions of the original granular chain ( which has a fundamentally discrete nature ) , traveling waves in strongly nonlinear regimes exhibit a superexponential decay at the edge of the distribution instead of having compact support  @xcite . in the presence of precompression , which yields a linear term in eq",
    "@xcite illustrated both analytically and numerically that energy - localizing states can arise in the form of dark breathers .      by changing the magnitude of the static load @xmath32 relative to the displacements @xmath33 between particles , one can tune the strength of the nonlinearity in eq .",
    "( [ hertz ] ) . to do this ,",
    "we approximate the force using a power - series expansion , which is known to be suitable for a strongly compressed or weakly nonlinear chain @xcite .",
    "we thereby distinguish three different regimes , which we now discuss .      in this regime",
    ", we linearize eq .   about the equilibrium state in the presence of precompression to obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 note that we have neglected the higher - order terms ( even the quadratic ones ) in the expansion for very weak strains ( i.e. , small relative displacements ) .",
    "this linear limit corresponds to a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "we represent the solutions to eq .   as complex wavefunctions to obtain a complete set of eigenfunctions of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the eigenfrequency ( so the eigenvalue is @xmath39 ) .",
    "in the homogeneous case  i.e. , for @xmath40 for all @xmath11  we obtain plane waves @xmath41 , and the dispersion relation , @xmath42}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the mass of a particle , gives a single acoustic branch .",
    "the frequency satisfies the bounds @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so the group velocity in this homogeneous case is @xmath46 the maximum of the group velocity is @xmath47 , and it occurs when @xmath48 . from @xmath49 , we are able to write expressions for several quantities . for instance , given an initially localized excitation @xmath50 , wave spreading takes place within a cone @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , in our simulations , we consider systems that have at least @xmath52 spheres , where @xmath53 is the integration time and we recall that the ceiling function is @xmath54 .",
    "this consideration allows us to avoid boundary effects when we study dynamics .    for an arbitrary arrangement of spheres in a granular chain , the eigenvalue problem associated with eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) takes the generic form @xmath55 where @xmath39 is the eigenvalue and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath58 of masses and @xmath59 are the elements of a tridiagonal symmetric matrix .",
    "note that we have used fixed boundaries at both ends of the chain ( see eqs .   and ) . for a disordered chain ( see sec .",
    "[ types ] for the different types of disorder that we study ) , both matrices have random entries .",
    "consequently , @xmath60 is an asymmetric tridiagonal matrix with random entries .",
    "an intermediate regime between eqs .   and   is described by @xmath62\\ , ,      \\label{hertzwnl}\\ ] ] where @xmath63    this amounts to a particular case of the fpu model  @xcite that includes the so - called `` @xmath64 '' and `` @xmath65 '' terms from two of the forms of nonlinearity in the original fpu model . one interesting feature of this regime is that small - amplitude intrinsic localized modes ( ilms , which are also often called `` discrete breathers '' ) @xcite of the bright type ( i.e. , on top of a non - vanishing background ) do not exist   in the absence of disorder because of the specific relations between the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 in eq .  .",
    "this phenomenon was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the consideration of modulational instabilities ( mis ) of linear waves due to nonlinearity .",
    "an mi is a generic mechanism to generate such localized waves from linear waves at band edges of a linear spectrum .",
    "however , to have an mi , it is necessary that @xmath69 , which is not satisfied in the present case .",
    "nevertheless , introducing impurities in a granular chain leads to the emergence of breather - like `` defect '' solutions that bifurcate from linear impurity modes  @xcite .      when precompression is sufficiently weak in comparison to the strains ( and for vanishing precompression ) , one can no longer approximate eq .   by truncating a taylor expansion . in general , for materials in which the sound speed goes to @xmath31 or remains very small , it is not reasonable to use a standard linear approximation as a starting point for a perturbative analysis  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly interesting from the point of view of transport and localization theory in nonlinear disordered systems , because almost all of the research in the field has focused on the influence of nonlinearity for disordered systems in which the linear spectrum is initially either full of or partially full of localized states  @xcite .",
    "consequently , understanding the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity in the sonic - vacuum limit brings new theoretical challenges , and  as we shall see  it also produces a fundamentally distinct form of dynamics .    as a starting point towards developing a theory for transport and localization in granular crystals ,",
    "we nevertheless start by focusing our efforts in a standard way by extending the linear theory to the nonlinear regime .",
    ".[tab : tableratios]calculations of the ratio @xmath71 for an initial displacement excitation @xmath72 in a homogeneous chain .",
    "we use the value @xmath73 @xmath74 m . [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ tabla ]    to provide reference values , tables  [ tab : table1 ] and  [ tab : table2 ] also include our results for the computation of characteristic exponents for homogeneous granular chains . for linear homogeneous chains , one can derive analytically that @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the transport is ballistic for all values of @xmath32 , but the ipr saturates below certain values of @xmath32 .",
    "( as one can see in figs . [ f13-m2ipr ] and  [ f13-m2iprv ] ,",
    "this saturation is clear for @xmath77 n. ) this is related to the system becoming strongly nonlinear , with no linear waves propagating , so the initial wave splits into two traveling energy - carrying pulses .",
    "these pulses are spatially localized , so @xmath3 does not grow as a function of time .",
    "we characterized the localization and transport properties of one - dimensional disordered granular crystals for both uncorrelated and correlated disorders .",
    "we found , in the linear regime , that there are different extended modes that can contribute to the transport in a disordered system .",
    "we investigated the correlation properties of three types of disorder  an anderson model and two random dimer models  and we demonstrated that the rules that generate the spin - based dimer chain ( i.e. , rdm2 ) can contain either short - range or long - range correlations in the disorder .",
    "we showed , by direct diagonalization of the linearized granular chain in the presence of precompression , that localized linear modes are mostly impurity - like modes and that the spectrum of the linearized chain includes a mixture of extended and localized modes .",
    "the extended modes usually occur at low frequencies . using a spectral perspective",
    ", we again found that rdm2 chains are rather special , as ( in contrast to rdm1 , which is the traditional `` random dimer model '' ) they much more closely mirror the structure of a perfectly ordered diatomic chain than of a homogeneous chain .",
    "armed with an understanding of the linear modes , we set out to quantify the nonlinear dynamics of the three different types of disordered lattices .",
    "although the effects of nonlinearity ( in the absence of disorder ) in strongly nonlinear homogeneous granular crystals are known to be rather unusual  the energy tends to split into strongly localized traveling pulses , which leads to a saturation of the inverse participation ratio  we found very surprising and previously unexplored behavior when one introduces disorder into granular chains . when there is strong precompression ( i.e. , a very low level of nonlinearity ) , disorder tends to localize energy due to anderson - like effects .",
    "surprisingly , however , localization no longer emerges for sufficiently small precompression , as a disordered chain tends to a sort of `` thermalization '' as the energy spreads throughout the whole chain . in this case",
    ", neither the second moment nor the inverse participation ratio saturates , and presumably traveling waves can not survive the presence of disorder in this regime . nevertheless , it is conceivable in such a setting that stable localized waves may exist due to disorder .",
    "furthermore , very recently , @xcite reported that solitary - wave mobility can be enhanced in certain classes of nonlinear disordered lattices either by specific realizations of a type of disorder or with specific initial conditions .",
    "it is not clear when the joint presence of disorder and nonlinearity destroys localization , and investigating when this occurs is an important open question . in the sonic - vacuum regime of no precompression ,",
    "the exponents of the temporal asymptotic scaling of the inverse participation ratio are close to @xmath78 , which is what occurs in the linear homogeneous case ( in particular , for about @xmath79 n ) ; in other words , the energy is delocalized .",
    "however , the transport remains superdiffusive rather than ballistic .",
    "in fact , we found that each of our three disordered chain models is _ typically _ superdiffusive , in stark contrast to what is known about disorder in other lattice models  @xcite , in which a self - trapping mechanism always dominates as the strength of the nonlinearity increases ( independently of the disorder ) .    by computing a ( discretized ) logarithmic derivative @xmath80 of the second moment",
    ", we find for strongly precompressed ( i.e. , weakly nonlinear ) chains with initially localized displacement excitations that the spreading does not show a clear diffusive trend . in other words , the second moment behaves in a complicated way and exhibits oscillations that are larger than statistical fluctuations ( analogous to what was observed in @xcite ) . for anderson - like disorder and @xmath79 n",
    ", we observed that @xmath81 during the time interval that we consider .",
    "this behavior is clearer in anderson - like and rdm2 chains than in rdm1 chains .",
    "by contrast , for initially localized velocity excitations , we found that @xmath80 satisfies  , and we thus observed a standard power - law growth for the second moment : @xmath82 , with @xmath83 ( i.e. , superdiffusive spreading ) for all types of disorder .",
    "however , for weakly precompressed ( i.e. , strongly nonlinear ) chains , the dynamics is superdiffusive for all types of disorder and both types of initial conditions .",
    "surprisingly , in the sonic - vacuum regime , the exponents are very similar ( roughly @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and they seem to be independent of both the type of disorder and of whether we use a displacement or velocity excitation as an initial condition .",
    "moreover , granular lattices  which are inter - site interaction lattices of fpu type  appear to be far more conducive to energy transport than the previously explored kg and nls lattices .",
    "presumably , this situation arises from the ability of the granular lattices to transport energy in the strongly nonlinear regime in the form of robust traveling waves .",
    "our work opens a panorama of both theoretical and experimental possibilities . from a theoretical perspective , future challenges involve deriving the mechanisms that relate the type of correlation in chain disorder to the spectral and transport properties of the system , incorporating dissipation ( and possibly also restitution ) effects into disordered granular crystals , studying higher - dimensional granular crystals , examining other types of initial excitations , and more . in particular , we tried initializing the chain at a particular localized mode of the underlying linear system , and we observed that the spreading can be considerably slower in comparison to the initial conditions that we used in the present article .",
    "however , further investigation is necessary to quantitatively characterize the dynamics .",
    "we note , however , that the absence of the experimental capability to initialize a granular chain with a specific initial distribution in present settings renders such a study theoretically - motivated rather than practically - motivated at the moment .",
    "indirect experimental measures of the dynamical properties are possible using experimental techniques such as the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , and ( importantly ) recent more advanced techniques , such as laser doppler vibrometry , which now make it possible to measure the spatiotemporal properties of an entire granular chain ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in such an experimental setup , one can track the force at _ each _ particle as a function of time , and one can consequently directly measure quantities such as @xmath0 or @xmath84 as a function of time .",
    "naturally , it is rather tedious to conduct experiments with very long chains and using many realizations of a given type of disorder",
    ". nevertheless , neither of these is presently out of reach , as experiments with as many as @xmath85 particles have been reported  @xcite and multiple realizations to obtain ensemble averages have also been performed previously ( e.g. , in  @xcite ) . extending these considerations of the present paper and enabling even a partial measurement of the exponents presented herein would be extremely exciting in corroborating the superdiffusive transport dynamics that we have observed for disordered strongly nonlinear lattices .",
