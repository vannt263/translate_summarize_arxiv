    "with the simplest crystal structure among the iron - based superconductors ever found,@xcite pbo - type @xmath0-fese has attracted tremendous attention both experimentally and theoretically as an archetype system to explore the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in the iron - based superconductors .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 of fese is found to be 8 k at an ambient pressure,@xcite and extremely sensitive to external pressures while it can grow to the maximum of @xmath437 k around 6@xmath59 gpa.@xcite on the other hand , the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurement has found strongly enhanced antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin fluctuations near @xmath6 and that both @xmath6 and spin fluctuations are raised by pressures , suggesting a close correlation between the spin fluctuations and the superconducting mechanism in the iron - based superconductors.@xcite    with applied pressures , the crystal structure of @xmath0-fese shows notable changes .",
    "@xcite its volume undergoes as high as 20% reduction and the interlayer spacing shows large decreases.@xcite in contrast , the height of se from the fe - fe plane first decreases and then increases with pressure.@xcite by summarizing the @xmath3s of fese under pressures and the @xmath3s of various iron ( and nickel)-based superconductors , a striking correlation between the @xmath3 and the height of anion ( _ i.e. _ se in fese ) is revealed.@xcite moreover , moon and choi have found that the magnetic interactions and magnetic order are very sensitive to the height of chalcogen species from fe - fe plane by studying the fete system with fixed height @xmath7 using the density - functional calculations.@xcite this is also reflected in the experiments that the nonsuperconducting fete bulk samples become superconducting in the fete thin films under tensile stress.@xcite these observations indicate that the crystal structures and magnetic properties , both of which link with @xmath6 in iron chalcogenide superconductors , are obviously correlated and can be tuned by an applied pressure .",
    "a direct consequence of substantial changes in the crystal structure under pressure is that the lattice dynamics would be influenced .",
    "however , within the standard mcmillan - eliashberg framework , the electron - phonon coupling calculations without spin - polarization give too low values for the transition temperature @xmath6 of fese.@xcite when the spin polarization effects are included , the calculated electron - phonon coupling value in the checkerboard afm nel structure shows about a twofold increase , but still can not account for the experimentally observed @xmath6 of fese.@xcite it is now commonly accepted that fese is not a conventional electron - phonon superconductor,@xcite but the spin - fluctuation mediated paring yields the unconventional superconductivity.@xcite nevertheless , a clear iron isotope effect on @xmath3 of fese was observed in experimental measurement , @xcite and the magnetic properties were found to be very sensitive to the lattice parameters of fese@xmath8te@xmath9 from the density functional calculations,@xcite thus we are curious about what role the lattice vibrations play in the spin fluctuations ( via the spin - phonon coupling effect ) of fese .",
    "more importantly , how the role of the lattice vibrations will change along with pressure , especially around the pressure with the highest @xmath3 of fese , has never been studied .    as fese has se - fe@xmath10-se layers composed of edge - sharing tetrahedra with an fe center , the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction plays an important role in the interlayer bonding .",
    "when a pressure is applied , the interlayer distance of fese shows much larger reduction compared with the in - plane lattice constants.@xcite in order to precisely describe the lattice dynamics of fese under pressure in calculations , the vdw interactions between fese layers need to be accurately accounted for .",
    "since the conventional density functionals are unable to describe correctly the vdw interactions , which arise from nonlocal long - range electron correlations,@xcite both nonlocal correlation functional@xcite and a semi - empirical dispersion potential@xcite method have been proposed to include the dispersion interactions .",
    "nowadays , the density functional theory ( dft ) problem for vdw interaction has become a very active field and theoretical studies have been carried out on various relevant molecules and materials.@xcite however , the dft calculations with vdw - interaction corrections have rarely been applied to the iron - based superconductors.@xcite    we have studied the electronic structures , lattice dynamics , and magnetic properties of fese under pressure using dft calculations with vdw corrections .",
    "the variations of band structures and the phonon frequencies from 0 to 9 gpa , as well as the effect of zero - point vibrations of phonon modes on the local magnetic moment fluctuations and band structures have been investigated .",
    "the first - principles electronic structure calculations were carried out with the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package,@xcite which makes use of the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite the exchange - correlation functionals were represented by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) type.@xcite in order to describe the vdw interactions not included in the conventional density functional , our calculations adopted the dft - d2 method@xcite with semi - empirical dispersion energy adding to the kohn - sham dft energy .",
    "the energy cutoff for the plane waves was set to 350 ev .",
    "the 1 @xmath11 1 @xmath11 1 tetragonal cell of fese was used and the integration over the brillouin zone was performed with a 12 @xmath11 12 @xmath11 12 k - point mesh .",
    "the fermi - level was broadened by the gaussian smearing method with a width of 0.05 ev .",
    "both the cell parameters and the internal atomic positions were allowed to relax .",
    "the system under hydrostatic pressures in a range of 0@xmath59 gpa was simulated by assigning the converged trace of the stress tensor to a targeting pressure and minimizing the enthalpy of the system . in the studied pressure range ,",
    "the structure of the system has not changed to hexagonal.@xcite the atoms were allowed to relax until the forces were smaller than 0.01 ev /  . after the equilibrium structures were obtained , the frequencies and displacement patterns of the phonon modes were calculated using the dynamical matrix method.@xcite the atomic displacements due to the zero - point vibrations of phonon modes were obtained according to the method of ref . .",
    "in the present case , the atoms were displaced to the vibrational state with a potential energy of @xmath122 for a specified phonon mode @xmath13 , while its normal - mode coordinates can reach two maxima along two opposite directions .",
    "there is another issue in the calculations need to be noted ,",
    "_ i.e. _ the magnetic order that we choose in this study . unlike other iron pnictides such as laofeas@xcite and",
    "bafe@xmath10as@xmath10,@xcite no any long - range magnetic order has been found for @xmath0-fese in experiment .",
    "however , the strong afm spin fluctuations were observed for the undoped fese .",
    "@xcite theoretically it is very difficult to directly simulate such a paramagnetic phase by using dft calculations . considering that the checkerboard - afm nel order and the paramagnetic phase share the following important features : ( 1 ) local moments around fe atoms , ( 2 ) zero net magnetic moments in a unit cell , and ( 3 ) the same space symmetry , the checkerboard - afm nel state can be thus feasible to properly model the paramagnetic phase in many aspects .",
    "@xcite especially , for the recently grown fese monolayer on srtio@xmath14 with signatures of @xmath3 above 50 k by transport measurement,@xcite the observed shape of fermi surface in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite can be reproduced in the dft calculations by the afm nel order of fese monolayer either without substrate@xcite or on srtio@xmath14 substrate.@xcite in table i , our calculated lattice parameters for bulk fese in nonmagnetic and afm nel states with or without vdw interactions are compared with the experimental results . as listed in the table , the calculated structure parameters in the afm nel order with vdw interaction show the best overall agreement with the experimental measurement @xcite and also yield the better results than the previous calculations by using pbe and hybrid functionals.@xcite more importantly , the lattice constant along the stacking direction which would change most under pressure is well reproduced .",
    "so we choose the afm nel order to simulate the paramagnetic phase of fese in the following studies .",

    "after the same analysis on charge density , it is ascertained that this band originates from the @xmath22 orbital of fe at zero pressure and becomes the @xmath23/@xmath24 orbital at 5 and 6 gpa .",
    "the hole pockets around @xmath21 point and the electron pockets around @xmath25 point are consistent with previous arpes experiment.@xcite in addition to the @xmath21 and @xmath25 points , our calculated band structures also show some obvious changes around the @xmath26 and @xmath27 points . around @xmath26 point ,",
    "the occupied energy band ( labeled by orange line ) consisting of fe @xmath28 orbital at low pressures becomes unoccupied one with feature of fe @xmath22 orbital at 6 gpa .",
    "the changes around @xmath27 point are similar as that around @xmath25 point . in one word , the occupations of energy bands around the fermi level which originate from the @xmath23/@xmath24 and @xmath22 orbitals of fe are very sensitive to pressure . from the analysis on density of states ( dos ) ,",

    "the applied pressure makes the crystal lattice constants of fese decrease , especially resulting in the collapse of separation between fese layers from 5.47   at 0 gpa to 4.99   at 6 gpa .",

    "not only the electronic band structures show large variations with pressure , but also the lattice dynamics demonstrate obvious changes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , all of the optical phonon frequencies of fese at brillouin zone center increase with pressure .",
    "they are labeled in the sequence of energy .",
    "the modes v2 , v3 , and v6 are all doubly degenerate in - plane vibrations . among all optical phonons ,",
    "the frequency of mode v5 has a clear sharp jump from 5 to 6 gpa .",
    "the hollow triangles in the figure are experimental results of raman scattering at zero pressure and temperature 7 k,@xcite which are in the same color as the corresponding calculated values . by comparison between experimental and calculated results",
    ", there is about 5% deviation for the frequencies of modes v4 and v5 , which ascertains our theoretical approach using the afm nel state .",
    "the frequencies calculated using fully relaxed structure in nonmagnetic state with vdw interaction show much worse agreement ( @xmath430% deviation ) with experiment . in a recent raman - scattering measurement on fe - based superconductor k@xmath36fe@xmath37se@xmath38 under atmospheric pressure ,",
    "an anomalous hardening was observed for the a@xmath39 mode at @xmath3 , indicating a particular type of connection between phonons and superconductivity.@xcite in our calculations , both the frequency ( 194.5 @xmath40 ) and the symmetry ( @xmath2 , shown below ) of mode v5 for fese are similar to the 180 @xmath40 @xmath41 mode in k@xmath36fe@xmath37se@xmath38.@xcite some experiments on fese have shown that depending on the specific methods to apply pressure , a maximum @xmath3 of 37 k can be reached under pressures approximately 6@xmath59 gpa.@xcite the anomalous freuqnecy jump of the phonon mode v5 around the similar pressure range indicates some relationship between this mode and the superconductivity of fese .    in order to identify the characteristics of each phonon mode ,",
    "we plot the atomic displacement patterns at 6 gpa in fig .",
    "the displacement arrows are in the same scale among all panels . for the phonon mode v1 ,",
    "the atoms show the same displacement directions for the same atomic species and the opposite movements for different species .",
    "it is an infrared active @xmath42 mode .",
    "modes v2 , v3 and v6 are all doubly degenerate in - plane vibrations , while modes v2 and v6 are raman active and mode v3 is infrared active . both modes v4 and v5 are out - of - plane vibrations . the mode v4 consists of the opposite vertical motions of fe atoms in the same plane , while the mode v5 involves the coherent motions of se atoms relative to their adjacent fe - fe planes .",
    "the atomic displacement patterns are consistent with previous studies.@xcite in ref .",
    ", the authors found that the anion height relative to the fe - fe plane is a key factor influencing the @xmath3 of iron - based superconductors . among all phonon modes of fese , atomic displacements in modes v1 and v5 change the se height mostly .",
    "however , in mode v1 , the se atoms above and below the fe - fe plane show opposite height changes relative to the fe - fe plane and break the original spacial symmetry of fese .",
    "meanwhile , the displacements of se atoms in the @xmath2 mode v5 control precisely the se height from fe - fe plane and keep the same symmetry as that before moving . in a recent time- and angle - resolved photoemission experiments on eufe@xmath38as@xmath38,@xcite the modulations of electron and hole dynamics due to the @xmath2 phonon was observed . using femtosecond optical pulses , kim _ et .",
    "_ have also detected the transient magnetic ordering in bafe@xmath38as@xmath38 quasi - adiabatically follows the lattice vibrations of @xmath2 mode with a frequency of 5.5 thz.@xcite due to the sharp increase of phonon frequency for the @xmath2 mode v5 of fese at 6 gpa ( fig .",
    "2 ) , it is very tempting to deduce that the @xmath2 phonon mode plays an important role in the @xmath3 increase of fese with pressure .    due to the sharp frequency increase of phonon mode v5 from 5 to 6 gpa ,",
    "zero - point vibrations of optical phonons were simulated in order to study their influence on the spin in fese .",
    "the fese system was set to the vibrational state with zero - point energy of @xmath43w@xmath44/2 in a specified phonon mode @xmath13 , while the normal - mode coordinate could reach maxima along two opposite directions .",
    "so there are two displacement patterns for each mode at each pressure .",
    "we plot the difference of local magnetic moment on fe between the two displacement patterns of each mode at various pressures ( fig .",
    "4 ) , namely @xmath45 = @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the local magnetic moment on fe for one displacement and @xmath48 the other . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath45 caused by the zero - point vibration of mode v5 has much bigger values than all other phonon modes from 0 to 9 gpa and it reaches maximum value at 5 gpa . for zero - point vibrations induced by other phonon modes , @xmath45 are not zero only around 6 gpa .",
    "so it can be concluded that all phonon modes enhance the afm fluctuations around 6 gpa .",
    "this is in accordance with the experimental observations that application of pressure on fese enhances afm spin fluctuations.@xcite as the pressure increase , the occupations of energy bands around fermi level consisting of fe @xmath31 orbitals demonstrate large variations ( fig .",
    "the sensitive occupations of these fe @xmath31 orbitals to lattice vibrations are responsible for the local magnetic moment fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the local magnetic moment @xmath25 on fe in fese at equilibrium structure gets smaller and smaller with increasing pressure , which can be learned that the pressure suppresses the afm state .",
    "this also agrees with the viewpoint that superconductivity is induced by doping charge carriers into the parent compound to suppress the afm state in both the cuprate@xcite and the iron - based@xcite superconductors . because of the anomalous frequency increase of phonon mode v5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and the enhanced spin fluctuations around 5@xmath56 gpa ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , it is arrived that spin - phonon coupling exists and plays an important role in fese under pressure .",
    "although the atomic displacements due to the zero - point vibration of the @xmath2 mode are very small ( about 0.03  ) , the effect on the electronic band structure is obvious .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the corresponding band structures when se moves ( a ) away from and ( b ) close to the fe - fe plane at 6 gpa . at @xmath21 point , the band around fermi level labeled by orange line is occupied when se moves away from the fe - fe plane [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] and becomes unoccupied when se moves close [ fig .",
    "5(b ) ] . through analysis from the band - decomposed charge density , this band consists of the fe @xmath22 orbital in fig .",
    "5(a ) and changes into the @xmath23/@xmath24 orbital in fig .",
    "around @xmath25 point , the energy band represented by red line shows opposite change to that at @xmath21 point .",
    "after the same analysis , it is confirmed that the band around @xmath25 point comes from the @xmath22 and @xmath23/@xmath24 orbitals of fe in fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) , respectively . however , the band change around the @xmath27 point is a little different from @xmath25 point . for @xmath27 point , the energy band ( in red color )",
    "shifts down with decreased energy when se moves close to the fe - fe plane .",
    "the three - dimensional views can be seen more clearly from the shape changes of fermi surfaces as plotted adjacent to the corresponding band structures .",
    "small changes of crystal structure due to zero - point vibration alone could not affect the energy band so much unless some other physical mechanism is included in this process .",
    "nonmagnetic calculations have been performed to ascertain our speculations . only in spin - polarized calculations ,",
    "the zero - point vibrations have great impact on the energy bands .",
    "the dramatic changes of band structures and fermi surfaces due to the zero - point vibrations of @xmath2 mode in afm nel state at 6 gpa further support that spin - phonon coupling plays a key role in fese under pressure .",

    "the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing is common in iron - based superconductors and other unconventional superconducting materials.@xcite regarding the nature of the magnetism in iron - based superconductors , there are basically two contradictive views .",
    "the one is based on itinerant electron picture,@xcite in which the fermi surface nesting is responsible for the afm order . on the contrary ,",
    "the other one is based on local moment interactions which can be described by the @xmath50-@xmath51 frustrated heisenberg model.@xcite and it was further shown  @xcite that the underlying driving force herein is the anion - bridged afm superexchange interaction between a pair of the next - nearest - neighboring fluctuating fe local moments embedded in itinerant electrons .",

    "<S> the electronic structures , lattice dynamics , and magnetic properties of crystal @xmath0-fese under hydrostatic pressure have been studied by using the first - principles electronic structure calculations with van der waals ( vdw ) corrections . with applied pressures , </S>",
    "<S> the energy bands around the fermi energy level consisting mainly of fe-@xmath1 orbitals show obvious energy shifts and occupation variations , and meanwhile the frequencies of all optical phonon modes increase . among these phonon modes , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 mode , which relates to the se height from the fe - fe plane , shows a clear frequency jump in the range between 5 and 6 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the pressure range within which the highest superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 of fese is reached in experiments . in comparison with the other phonon modes , </S>",
    "<S> the zero - point vibration of the @xmath2 mode induces the strongest fluctuation of local magnetic moment on fe under a pressure from 0 to 9 gpa , and the induced fluctuation reaches the maximum around 5 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the effect of phonon via spin - phonon coupling need to be considered when exploring the superconducting mechanism in iron - based superconductors . </S>"
