    "the match between the incoming nucleotide dntp and the template ( i.e. , the canonical watson - crick base pairing a - t and g - c ) in the replication process plays a central role for any organism to maintain its genome stability , whereas mismatch ( non - canonical base pairing like a - c ) may introduce harmful genetic variations into the genome , and thus the error rate of replication must be kept very low . in living cells ,",
    "the replication fidelity is controlled mainly by dna polymerase ( dnap)@xcite which catalyzes the template - directed dna synthesis , and the fidelity of dnap has been intensively studied since its discovery in 1950s.@xcite .",
    "pioneering theoretical studies on this issue were done by j.hopfield@xcite and j.ninio@xcite . regarding dna replication",
    "approximately as a binary copolymerization process of matched nucleotides ( denoted as a for convenience in the present paper ) and mismatched nucleotides ( denoted as b ) , they proposed independently the so - called kinetic proofreading mechanism which correctly points out that the replication fidelity is not determined thermodynamically by the free energy difference , but kinetically by the incorporation rate difference , between the match and the mismatch .",

    "[ scheme_compare](a1 ) ) , which is not the case of real dnaps .",
    "structural and functional studies show that dnap often has two parts .",
    "the basic part of all dnaps is a synthetic domain ( i.e. , polymerase ) which binds the incoming dntp and catalyzes its incorporation into the nascent ssdna strand ( called as primer below for convenience ) .",
    "proofreading is performed by a second domain ( i.e , exonuclease ) which is not a necessary part of dnap .",
    "this domain may much likely excise the just - incorporated mismatched nucleotide , once the mismatched terminus is transferred from the polymerase site into the exonuclease site by thermal fluctuation .",
    "the first model that explicitly invokes the exonuclease , referred to as galas - branscomb model ( fig .",

    "one is the pre - translocation state of dnap in which the dntp binding site is occupied by the primer terminus .",
    "the other is the post - translocation state in which the dnap translocates forward ( relative to the template ) to expose the binding site to the next dntp .",

    "the other is the post - translocation state in which the exonuclease site is exposed after the nucleotide excision while the newly - formed primer terminus does not return to the polymerase site .",
    "second , once the incoming dntp is incorporated into the primer , the dnap can either translocate forward to the post - translocation state and bind a new dntp in the polymerase site , or it pauses at the pre - translocation state and the primer terminus is unzipped from the duplex and transferred to the exonuclease site ( the terminus can switch between the two sites without being excised@xcite )",

    "[ scheme_simple ] , considering that the addition of dntp in the polymerase site is almost irreversible ( i.e. , the product ppi of the polymerization reaction is often released irreversibly under physiological conditions ) .",
    "one can also reasonably assume that the translocation of dnap in ` polymerase type ' complex is in a rapid equilibrium .",
    "in biochemical experimental studies such as steady - state kinetic assays@xcite , the translocation can not be observed ( for comparison , the subsequent dntp binding can be clearly observed ) . in other words ,",
    "the two substates can not be identified individually , indicating there exists a rapid equilibrium between them .",
    "thus one does not need to distinguish between the pre - translocation and the post - translocation states .",

    "actually , these dntps were observed to apparently accelerate the excision of the penultimate mismatch ( see scheme 2 of ref .  ) .",
    "this can be understood by the above expression of @xmath153 .",
    "since the duplex terminus is unstable due to the buried mismatch , the free dntp has the chance to bind transiently to the template at the polymerase site , which may accelerate the transfer of the primer terminus from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site , or hinder the back transfer . this will increase @xmath183 or decrease @xmath184 ( in either case , to increase @xmath185 ) , and",
    "thus enhance @xmath153 .",
    "in fact , @xmath185 was found to increase from 3 @xmath164 ( in the absence of matching dntp in the solution ) to up to @xmath186 ( in the presence of matching dntp ) , which leads to an order of magnitudes increase of @xmath153 .",
    "in this work , we propose a general kinetic framework to analyze the fidelity problem of dnap which owns both a polymerase site for primer growth and an exonuclease site for proofreading .",
    "so far as we know , it s the first time that the two sub - processes , as well as the higher - order terminal effects , can be rigorously studied in a unified way ( either for model i or for model ii ) .",
    "closed equations were derived which fully describe the steady - state replication process . by these equations ,",
    "the replication fidelity @xmath98 , as well as other quantities such as the total flux @xmath187 ( the overall reaction velocity ) , can be calculated .",
    "in particular , using the infinite - state markov chain method which is numerically equivalent to our steady - state equations , we derived analytical expressions of @xmath98 for both model i and model ii under bio - relevant conditions .",
    "we found that model i and model ii behave almost the same in every aspect ( e.g. , the fidelity , the overall reaction velocity , etc . ) under those conditions .",
    "this implies that the proofreading efficiency of dnap may not depend on the details of how the excised primer terminus returns from the exonuclease site to the polymerase site .",
    "furthermore , the highly simplified expressions of @xmath98 show that the replication fidelity is only determined by very few kinetic parameters , which indicates that the polymerization - proofreading mechanism is insensitive to details of the reaction schemes .",
    "the expression of @xmath98 of @xmath120-order model ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : fid_tot ] ) ) offers intuitive and important insights to understand the higher - order terminal effects .",
    "we noticed that the polymerase site can add @xmath2 to the primer terminus with a much larger rate than adding @xmath0 , which contributes significantly to the overall fidelity . in this pathway , however , the @xmath120-order terminal effects are not reflected explicitly in @xmath151 .",
    "in fact , the higher - order effects work in the proofreading pathway .    to simply put ,",
    "when the primer terminus contains one @xmath0 at whatever position , it can be extended one @xmath2 by the polymerase site , or be transferred and excised by the exonuclease site .",
    "once the former is much larger than the latter ( see condition ( c ) , for @xmath188 ) , it can substantially contribute to @xmath98 as a ratio between these two rates . in principle , for each possible position ( the terminal , the penultimate , etc . ) of @xmath0 , there is a corresponding ratio contributing to @xmath153 .",
    "however , it seems only a few leading ratios contribute significantly to @xmath153 . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the higher - order effects may originate mainly from base - stacking interaction in the dna duplex .",
    "the presence of terminal or penultimate mismatch may significantly disrupt the base stacking of the duplex terminus , and thus increases the transfer - and - excision rate and decreases the addition rate , which enhances the proofreading contribution to the overall fidelity . on the other hand , deeper mismatches may put less impact on both rates and thus on the proofreading efficiency ( see condition ( c ) , for @xmath189 ) .",
    "for instance , in the case of human mitochondrial dnap pol @xmath174 , it has been observed @xmath190 ( table  [ table1 ] ) , and thus the contribution of the buried mismatch ( in the absence of matching dntp in the solution ) to @xmath153 , @xmath182 , is smaller than that of the terminal mismatch @xmath181 .",
    "this raises the question that whether the third - order even higher - order effects can be observed for any real dnaps . for the third - order model ,",
    "@xmath191 . if @xmath192 approaches to @xmath193 which is much larger than any other kinetic parameter , then the term corresponding to the third - order effect @xmath194 is negligible , meaning that this has no practical contributions to fidelity .",
    "whether such higher - order effects exist for other dnaps is worthy investigation in the future .",
    "it should also be pointed out that we have not discuss the sequence effect on the fidelity in this paper . as shown by experiments such as ref .",
    ", the 16 possible base pairs may have different incorporation rates or excision rates , which of course have more or less impact on the overall fidelity .",
    "our model and indeed all the existing models , are actually based on the presumption that the rates of the 4 matches are of similar order of magnitude , and the rates of the 12 mismatches are also of similar order of magnitude .",
    "this coarse - grained description of dna replication process is appropriate for the purpose to estimate the overall replication fidelity , but can not account for much subtle effects such as sequence - dependent replication errors which are biologically very important . to develop a new kinetic theory to take account of the sequence effects would be very challenging , since the symbolic sequence of the template is inevitably involved , which leads to many difficulties for theoretical studies ( e.g. , it s hard to rigorously define the steady state ) .",
    "actually , there have been some numerical simulations in that respect ( e.g. , see ref .  ) , but rigorous modeling of the simulated processes is still lacking . the approach presented in this paper may serve as a start for further development of such a modeling framework .",

    "\\(b ) it s also possible that the primer terminal @xmath102 is buried by the next dntp addition and eventually be excised .",
