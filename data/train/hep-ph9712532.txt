    "search for lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is one of the most important ways to explore physics beyond the standard model , because lepton flavors are conserved individually in the standard model . in the standard model with supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model",
    ", lfv is allowed .",
    "the soft susy breaking masses of the scalar leptons ( sleptons ) do not have to conserve the lepton flavors in general . however , the resulting lfv exceeds much the present experimental bounds such as the one from @xmath2 search if an arbitrary , but consistent with the naturalness argument , set of slepton soft masses is allowed .",
    "the universal soft mass scenario lead from supergravity @xcite is often assumed to avoid this large lfv ( and the same problem in the scalar quark sector ) . in this scenario ,",
    "all the sleptons degenerate and we have no flavor mixing in the lepton and slepton sector .    however , this is not the whole story when grand unified theories ( guts ) are considered at the same time @xcite . in susy guts with the universal soft breakings at planck scale ,",
    "the large top yukawa coupling affects the third generation slepton mass through renomalization group evolution from planck scale to gut scale , since quark and lepton supermultiplets are unified into larger gut multiplets . as a result",
    ", the sleptons no longer degenerate and lfv is expected to take place .    along this line , rates of @xmath2 decay , @xmath3 decay , @xmath4",
    "decay and @xmath5 conversion in nuclei have been estimated in the literature @xcite . in the minimal su(5 ) model , the @xmath2 branching ratio has been found to be typically one or two order below the present experimental upper bound ( @xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "the other modes tend to give two or more order smaller values than experimental bounds . in the so(10 )",
    "model , the @xmath2 amplitude is enhanced by a factor @xmath7 due to its chiral structure different from the su(5 ) model , and thus the decay rate could be the same order as or even larger than the experimental bound @xcite .    besides these rare processes that are caused by virtual slepton exchange , it is possible to search for lfv through real slepton production and its successive decay @xcite .",
    "the most prominent qualitative difference between the virtual and the real processes can be seen in behaviors of their amplitudes as the sleptons are getting to degenerate .",
    "the virtual process behaves as @xmath8 , while the real process does as @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is a slepton mass squared difference , @xmath11 is the average mass of the sleptons and @xmath12 is the average slepton width . because @xmath13 , we expect a good chance to observe lfv even for relatively degenerate sleptons once their real production at collider experiments becomes possible . the advantage of real production is maximized if @xmath14 is realized . in the following ,",
    "we show that it happens in the minimal susy su(5 ) model .",
    "another important point to have a realistic lfv cross section of the real production and decay is necessity of relatively large flavor mixing in the lepton - slepton sector . in the minimal susy",
    "su(5 ) model , the leptons and the down - type quarks have the same yukawa couplings at the gut scale .",
    "this means that lfv is essentially controlled by cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix which describes the quark mixing .",
    "since ckm matrix is almost diagonal @xcite , lfv cross sections are suppressed by the small off - diagonal elements of ckm matrix .",
    "it is shown below that lfv cross sections at linear collider experiments are hopelessly small in the minimal susy su(5 ) model .    however , the minimal susy su(5 ) model is no more than a calculable example .",
    "in fact , it can not describe the whole known fermion masses and mixing @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned equality of the down - type quark yukawa couplings and the leptonic ones leads to inconsistent mass relation for the first and second generations , although it gives the celebrated bottom to tau mass ratio .",
    "once we extend the model to overcome this insufficiency , the leptonic yukawa couplings are no longer necessary to be the same as the down - type quark yukawa couplings .",
    "thus , the leptonic mixing is independent of ckm matrix in general .    in this paper",
    ", we show that lfv cross sections of charged slepton pair production and decay at linear collider experiments are sizable if the lepton mixing has some appropriate structures . in sec .",
    "[ fw ] , we describe our framework based on susy su(5 ) gut more explicitly .",
    "our numerical results on present experimental constraints and lfv cross sections are presented in sec .",
    "[ cr ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "apart from yukawa sector , our working model is the minimal susy su(5 ) gut with the universal soft susy breaking terms at planck scale , which detail is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of lfv .",
    "the quarks and leptons are unified into three pairs of su(5 ) chiral supermultiplets , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , with their superpartners , where @xmath19 is a generation index . as for higgs sector , we assume the minimal one , i.e. @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath24 ) .    in the minimal model , yukawa superpotential is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the yukawa coupling matrix which gives up - type quark masses , and @xmath27 is the one giving down - type quark and charged lepton masses .",
    "we can take @xmath26 to be diagonal without loss of generality .",
    "thus , the flavor mixing in the lepton sector as well as the quark sector is governed by @xmath27 in the minimal model . as will be shown later , lfv cross sections of charged slepton pair production and decay are too small to be measured in this case .",
    "however , as is mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , the above minimal model is known to predict incorrect mass relation for the first and the second generations . to be realistic ,",
    "it is natural to extend eq .",
    "( [ w0 ] ) . as a result",
    ", we expect that the leptonic yukawa matrix is different from the down - type one .",
    "for instance , this is realized by introducing the following higher dimensional term that might be induced by gravity @xcite : @xmath28 where the greek indices are su(5 ) ones .",
    "note that the effective yukawa coupling @xmath29 could have the same order of magnitude as @xmath27 due to the small masses of bottom and tau provided that @xmath30 and @xmath31 is not too large .    in the following",
    ", we do not discuss specific extensions like eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) . instead , we simply regard the leptonic mixing as independent from the quark mixing",
    ".    lepton mass matrix at the weak scale , @xmath32 , is diagonalized as @xmath33 by unitary transformations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 denote the gauge eigen states , @xmath39 are the mass eigen states , and generation indices are suppressed .",
    "making the same unitary transformations for corresponding sleptons , we obtain the following @xmath40 charged slepton mass matrix : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 unit matrix , @xmath46 denotes the degenerate left(right)-handed charged slepton mass squared coming from the soft and electroweak breakings , @xmath47 is the universal soft breaking trilinear coupling for slepton , @xmath48 denotes the shift of the soft breaking mass of the third generation charged slepton during the renomalization group evolution from @xmath49 to @xmath50 due to the large top yukawa coupling , and @xmath51 is the similar shift of the soft breaking trilinear coupling .",
    "the renomalization group equations necessary to evaluate these quantities are found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because of the degeneracy of the left - handed slepton soft masses , @xmath52 does not appear in eq .  ( [ slm ] ) .",
    "thus , lfv is controlled by a @xmath45 unitary matrix @xmath53 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath53 contains only two parameters since , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ slm ] ) , the first and second generation right - handed slepton soft breaking parameters are the same .",
    "in addition , apparently no cp violating complex phase exists in @xmath53 . in the following analysis",
    ", we take absolute values of ( 3,1 ) and ( 3,2 ) elements of @xmath53 as the parameters in @xmath53 .",

    "these input parameters are consistent with present experiments @xcite other than lfv experiments discussed below for all possible values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "@xmath5 conversion and @xmath3 decay also give similar constrains on the @xmath54@xmath55 plane as @xmath2 . since they tend to be weaker than the @xmath2 constraint @xcite , we do not discuss them for simplicity .    in fig .",
    "[ cs3 ] , we show cross sections of lfv processes through pair production of the lightest charged sleptons at linear collider experiments for the case that @xmath66 .",
    "[ cs3](a ) shows the total cross section of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the lightest charged slepton .",
    "we assume @xmath80 and 100% right - handed polarization of the electron beam .",
    "the @xmath2 constraint is also shown for comparison .",
    "we expect 40fb as the maximal cross section in spite of the strong constraint because of different dependence on @xmath53 from @xmath2 .",
    "this process depends on @xmath53 mainly through combinations of @xmath81 and @xmath82 corresponding to the s- and t- channel diagrams respectively . the allowed maximal lfv cross section is obtained in the case that @xmath83 .",
    "note that the lfv cross section is of order 0.1fb if @xmath53 has a similar structure to ckm matrix as in the minimal su(5 ) model .",
    "[ cs3](b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) show the total cross cross sections of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the same @xmath87 and beam polarization are assumed as fig .",
    "[ cs3](a ) .",
    "the maximal values of cross sections are about 150fb , 80fb , and 280fb respectively .",
    "these values are realized in the case that @xmath88 .",
    "other lepton flavor violating combinations in the final state charged lepton pair give less interesting cross sections for both @xmath89 and @xmath90 collisions .",
    "[ cs10 ] shows the same quantities as fig .",
    "[ cs3 ] , but for @xmath67 .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ cs10 ] with fig .",
    "[ cs3 ] , we find that the lfv cross sections are smaller for larger @xmath61 .",
    "this means that these processes are complimentary to @xmath2 which is enhanced for larger @xmath61 .",
    "the reduction of the lfv cross sections for larger @xmath61 is due to large left - right mixing of scalar tau leptons . to see this ,",
    "it is enough to consider the following @xmath45 submatrix of eq .",
    "( [ slm ] ) : @xmath91 where we neglect terms other than the one proportional to @xmath92 in @xmath93 .",
    "since we are considering a large @xmath61 case , the left - right mixing angle of the scalar tau leptons is almost 45 degree . by making the 45 degree rotation in the 13 plane of @xmath94",
    ", we obtain a matrix closer to a diagonal form : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the 45 degree rotation matrix : @xmath97",
    "it is legitimate to diagonalize eq .",
    "( [ rslm45 ] ) perturbatively in order to see qualitative behavior of the slepton flavor mixing . as a result , we find that lfv related off - diagonal elements of the slepton mixing matrix are approximately proportional to @xmath98 in the large @xmath61 case .",
    "thus , the lfv cross sections are suppressed as @xmath61 becomes large .",
    "before concluding we discuss some background issues .",
    "possible extensions of our calculation are also discussed here .",
    "our lfv signals are @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes @xmath101 or @xmath60 for the @xmath0 collision , and @xmath102 with @xmath103 or @xmath104 for the @xmath1 collision .",
    "the tau leptons are identified with their hadronic decays .",
    "the pure leptonic decay modes can also be used with impact parameter analysis in principle . a ccd pixel vertex detector proposed for linear collider experiments",
    "has a typical resolution better than 10@xmath60 m @xcite , while @xmath105 of tau lepton is about 90@xmath60 m @xcite .",
    "the most serious standard model background in @xmath0 collision is the one from @xmath106 boson pair production .",
    "a leptonic @xmath106 pair decay @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) is a background event .",
    "@xmath109 followed by a pure leptonic decay of one of the @xmath104 s can also be a background if the above - mentioned impact parameter analysis is not effective .",
    "however , these @xmath110 backgrounds are reduced by employing a right - handed electron beam as we did in the above calculation .",
    "appropriate kinematical cuts are also useful . with these procedures ,",
    "the background cross section is reduced to less than @xmath111fb with a reasonable efficiency of about @xmath112 for the signal @xcite . @xmath113 and @xmath114 could also be backgrounds of about 1fb @xcite .",
    "@xmath115 @xmath116 , and @xmath117 could also be backgrounds .",
    "they can be reduced to @xmath111fb or less by appropriate selection cuts @xcite .",
    "moreover , the impact parameter analysis could reduce these modes to negligible levels .    as for the @xmath1 collision ,",
    "our lfv signals are essentially free from backgrounds .",
    "in particular , the right - handed beams reduce @xmath118 mode to a negligible level without any selection cuts @xcite",
    ".    production of other superparticles could also be background .",
    "in particular , heavier slepton production makes lfv signals more complicated . to avoid it",
    ", we can choose such a @xmath87 that only a pair of the lightest charged sleptons is created .",
    "although the cross sections decrease , especially for the s - channel contribution in the @xmath0 collision , we still have sizable cross sections both for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions .    our observations in the present work",
    "can also be applied to other susy guts qualitatively .",
    "for instance , the lfv cross sections are expected to be sizable in the so(10 ) model . in this model , the left - handed sleptons , as well as the right - handed ones , cause lfv since the left - handed lepton supermultiplet of the third generation is unified into the same gut multiplet as the top quark",
    ". then , as is mentioned in sec .  [ intro ] , the @xmath2 rate is enhanced by a factor @xmath119 because of the chirality - flip nature of this process . while @xmath76 is not enhanced .",
    "although the detail depends on the model , especially its yukawa superpotential , we expect a stronger constraint from @xmath2 and similar constraints from @xmath76 compared with the su(5 ) model . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cs3 ] and [ cs10 ] , a stronger @xmath2 constraint alone does not exclude sizable lfv cross sections .",

    "the lower initial state radiation of muon collider would make the threshold operation mentioned above more effective .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the lfv phenomena through slepton pair production and decay could be detectable at linear collider experiments in the susy su(5 ) gut . treating the lepton mixing matrix as a set of parameters independent of ckm matrix , we have discussed the constraints on it from the present experiments and calculated lfv cross sections . in spite of the stringent constraint from @xmath2",
