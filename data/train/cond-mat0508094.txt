    "proteins are long , flexible chains of amino acids which can assume , in the presence of a denaturant , an astronomically large number of open conformations",
    ". twenty different types of amino acids are found in naturally occurring proteins , and their sequence along the chain defines the primary structure of the protein .",
    "the native , folded state of the protein contains secondary structures such as @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-sheets which are in turn arranged to form the larger tertiary structures . under proper solvent conditions most proteins",
    "will fold into a unique native conformation which is determined by its sequence .",
    "one of the goals of protein folding research is to determine exactly how the folded state results from the specific sequence of amino acids in the primary structure .",
    "a number of theories exist to describe the forces that are responsible for protein folding  @xcite .",
    "since there are many fewer compact polymer conformations than non - compact ones , entropic forces resist the tight packing of globular proteins .",
    "tight packing is primarily the result of hydrophobic interactions between the amino acid monomers and the solvent molecules around them .",
    "compared to the local forces between neighboring monomers along the chain , the hydrophobic interactions were historically seen as nonlocal forces contributing to the collapse process , but not responsible for determining the specific form of the native structure  @xcite .",
    "this view has been challenged by ideas from polymer physics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , polymers with hydrophobic monomers when placed in a polar solvent like water will collapse to a configuration where the hydrophobic residues are protected from the solvent in the core of the collapsed structure .",
    "similarly , protein folding can be viewed as polymer collapse driven by hydrophobicity .",
    "the question then arises , how much of the observed secondary structure is a result of this non - specific collapse process ?    to examine the role of hydrophobic interactions in folding ,",
    "coarse - grained models of proteins have been developed , which reduce the 20 possible amino acid monomers to two types : hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) .",
    "further simplification is affected by using random walks on two or three dimensional lattices to represent chain conformations .",
    "vertices of the lattice visited by the walk are identified with monomers , which in the hp model are of the h or p variety .",
    "furthermore , in order to capture the compact nature of the folded protein state , hamiltonian walks are often used for chain conformations .",
    "the hamiltonian walk ( or `` compact polymer '' ) is a self - avoiding walk on a lattice that visits _ all _ the lattice sites .",
    "the compact polymer model was first used by flory @xcite in studies of polymer melting , and was later introduced by dill @xcite in the context of protein folding .",
    "the hp model provides a simple model within which a variety of questions regarding the relation of the space of sequences ( ordered lists of h and p monomers ) to the space of protein conformations ( hamiltonian walks ) can be addressed ; for a recent example see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the first questions to be examined within the compact polymer model was to what extent is the observed secondary structure of globular proteins ( i.e. , the appearance of well ordered helices and sheets ) simply the result of the compact nature of their native states .",
    "complete enumerations of compact polymers with lengths up to 36 monomers found a large average fraction of monomers participating in secondary structure  @xcite .",
    "this added weight to the argument that the observed secondary structure in proteins is simply a result of hydrophobic collapse to the compact state .",
    "this simple view was later challenged by off - lattice simulations , which showed that specific local interactions among monomers are necessary in order to produce protein - like helices and sheets  @xcite .    here",
    "we reexamine the question of secondary structure in compact polymers on the square lattice using monte - carlo sampling of the configuration space .",
    "we compute the probability of a monomer participating in secondary structure in the limit of very long chains .",
    "we show that this probability is strictly less than one , and that it depends on the precise definition of secondary structure in the lattice model .",
    "we also show that , in the long - chain limit , compact polymers are much more likely to exhibit secondary structure motifs than their non - compact counterparts , such as ideal chains , described by random walks , or polymers in a good solvent , modelled by self - avoiding random walks .",
    "the monte - carlo technique described below can be easily extended to three - dimensional lattices and other models ( such as the hp model ) that make use of hamiltonian walks . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we further demonstrate its utility in the context of the flory model of polymer melting @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian walks on different lattices are also interesting statistical mechanics models in their own right , as their scaling properties give rise to new universality classes of polymers .",
    "an unusual property of these walks is that different lattices do not necessarily lead to the same universality class .",
    "this lattice dependence is linked to geometric frustration that results from the constraint that hamilton walks must visit all the sites of the lattice .",
    "in addition , compact polymers can be obtained as the zero - fugacity limit of fully packed loop models ( the exact form of which depends on the lattice ) allowing for the exact calculation of critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "numerical investigations of compact polymers are typically hampered by the need to generate a sufficient number of statistically independent compact configurations for the construction of a suitable ensemble .",
    "it is not hard to see that attempting to generate compact structures by constructing self - avoiding random walks on a lattice would indeed be a problematic endeavor ; current state - of - the - art algorithms are essentially `` smarter '' chain growth strategies where the next step in the random walk is taken based on not only the self - avoidance constraint but on a sampling probability which improves as the program proceeds  @xcite .",
    "enumerations of all possible states have been performed for both regular self - avoiding random walks  @xcite and for compact polymers  @xcite , but this has only been possible for small lattices ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , an algorithm which can rapidly generate compact configurations on significantly larger lattices , without the complication of constructing advanced sampling probabilities would be an extremely useful tool .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a method for generating compact polymers based on the transfer matrix method was introduced .",
    "one limitation of the method is that the transfer matrices become prohibitively large as the number of sites in the direction perpendicular to the transfer direction increases above 10 .",
    "a very efficient monte - carlo method based on a graph theoretical approach was introduced in @xcite and improved on in @xcite by reducing the sampling bias .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to describe a monte - carlo method for efficiently generating compact polymer configurations on the square lattice for chain lengths up to @xmath3 .",
    "the monte - carlo algorithm outlined below makes use of the `` back bite '' move , which was first introduced by mansfield in studies of polymer melts @xcite .",
    "we perform a number of measurements to assess the validity and practicality of the algorithm for generating compact polymer configurations . probably the most important and",
    "certainly the most elusive property is that of ergodicity , which would guarantee that the algorithm can sample all compact polymer configurations .",
    "while we have been unsuccessful in constructing a proof of ergodicity , we find excellent numerical evidence for it based on a number of different tests .",
    "in particular , we check that the measured probability that the polymer endpoints are adjacent on the lattice is in agreement with exact enumeration results for polymer chain lengths up to @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the monte - carlo process satisfies detailed balance , which guarantees , at least in the theoretical limit of infinitely long runs , that the sampling is unbiased .",
    "we check this in practice with a quantitative test of sampling bias for @xmath5 ( ie .  for compact polymers on a @xmath6 square lattice ) .    for the monte - carlo process to be useful",
    "it should also sample the space of compact polymer configurations efficiently . to quantify this property of the algorithm , we measure the processing time required to generate a fixed number of compact polymer conformations , and find it to be linear in chain length @xmath7 .",
    "since the sampling is of the monte - carlo variety a certain number of monte - carlo steps need to be performed before the initial and the final structure can be deemed statistically independent .",
    "we find that this correlation time , measured in monte - carlo steps per monomer , grows with chain length as @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "we put the monte - carlo algorithm to good use by tackling the question of the statistics of secondary structure in compact polymer chains .",
    "while the previous study by chan and dill @xcite found a large fraction of monomers participating in secondary - structure motifs , the polymer physics question of what happens to this quantity in the long - chain limit , remained unanswered .",
    "based on exact enumerations for chain lengths up to @xmath10 the hypothesis that was put forward was that in the long chain limit almost all the monomers will participate in secondary structure .",
    "our computations on the other hand , show that the probability of a monomer participating in secondary structure tends to a fixed number strictly less than one .",
    "furthermore the actual number depends on the precise definitions used for secondary structure motifs .",
    "still , from gathered statistics on the appearance of helix - like motifs in simple random walks and self - avoiding walks , we conclude that the propensity for secondary structures in compact polymers is much greater than in their non - compact counterparts , even in the long chain limit .",
    "this provides further support for the idea that the global constraint of compactness , imposed on globular proteins by hydrophobicity , favors formation of secondary structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ mcsampling ]",
    "we describe our monte - carlo process for sampling compact polymers , which is based on mansfield s backbite move @xcite .",
    "the correctness and usefulness of the monte - carlo algorithm for sampling compact polymer configurations , is evaluated in section  [ mctest ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ secstr ] we give details of our computations of secondary structure statistics for compact polymers with lengths ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath3 .",
    "the main conclusion of this section is that the fraction of monomers participating in secondary structures is gaussian distributed with a variance that vanishes in the long - chain limit .",
    "its mean is strictly less than one but still more than twice as large as the values measured for non - compact lattice models of polymers .",
    "the monte carlo process starts with an initial hamiltonian walk on the lattice .",
    "we use a square lattice with side @xmath11 , @xmath7 being the polymer length .",
    "the initial walk is the `` plough '' shown in fig .",
    "[ init ] . starting from this initial compact polymer configuration ,",
    "new configurations are generated by repeatedly applying the backbite move @xcite .",
    "namely , given a hamiltonian walk ( fig .",
    "[ process]a ) , a link is added between one of the walk s free ends and one of the lattice sites adjacent , but not connected , to that end .",
    "this adjacent site is chosen at random with each possible site having an equal probability of being chosen ( fig .",
    "[ process]b ) .",
    "after the new link has been added we no longer have a valid hamiltonian walk , since _ three _ links are now incident to the chosen site . to correct this we remove one of the three links , which is _ uniquely _ characterized by being part of a cycle ( closed path ) and not being the link just added ( fig .  [ process]c ) .",
    "after one iteration of this process one of the ends of the walk has moved two lattice spacings , and a new hamiltonian walk has been constructed ( fig .",
    "[ process]d ) .    by repeatedly executing the backbite move it seems that all possible hamiltonian walks are generated . to examine this statement more closely ,",
    "we first consider compact polymers on a @xmath12 lattice .",
    "[ 3by3enum ] shows an enumeration of all possible compact polymer configurations on this lattice .",
    "the corresponding walks may be divided into three classes where all the walks in a given class ( * p*lough , * s*piral or * l*ocomotive  denoted p , s and l in the figure ) are related by reflection ( denoted r in the figure ) and/or rotation .",
    "( note that p - class walks are invariant under rotation by 180 degrees , and that there are half as many p - class walks as s or l - class walks . )",
    "[ 3by3trans ] shows the transition graph that connects compact polymer configurations on a @xmath13 lattice that are related by a single backbite move .",
    "we see that all the 20 possible walks can be reached from any initial walk .",
    "furthermore , it is important to notice that the s - class walks have four moves leading in and out of them , while the l and p - class walks only have two moves leading in and out of them .",
    "this happens as a result of the locations of a walk s end points .",
    "namely , on a square lattice an end point on a corner can only be linked to one adjacent site by the backbite move , end points on the edges can be linked to two sites , while end points in the interior of the lattice can be linked to three sites . because there are twice as many moves leading to s - class walks as there are for p - class or l - class , the s - class walks are twice as likely to be generated if backbite moves are repeatedly performed ( this subtlety is absent if periodic boundary conditions are employed ) .    in order to compensate for this source of bias in sampling of compact polymers , an adjustment to the original process is made : for structures which have fewer paths available to access them , we introduce the option of leaving the current walk unchanged in the next monte - carlo step .",
    "the probability of making a transformation from the current walk is calculated by counting how many links @xmath14 can be drawn from the end points of the current walk and dividing that number by the maximum number ( @xmath15 ) of links that could be drawn for any walk on the lattice .",
    "for example , consider a p - class walk on a @xmath12 lattice .",
    "there are two possible links that could be drawn from the end points of this walk , but there is a maximum of 4 links that could be drawn ( which happens in the case of s - class walks ) .",
    "thus the probability of making a backbite move is @xmath16 .    with this adjustment of the original monte carlo process ,",
    "all walks accessible from the initial walk will occur with equal probability , upon repeating the algorithm a sufficiently large number of times . technically speaking ,",
    "the amended algorithm satisfies _ detailed balance_. in general , the criterion for detailed balance reads @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the probability of the system being in the state @xmath0 , and @xmath19 is the transition probability of going from the state @xmath0 to another state @xmath20 . in thermal equilibrium",
    "one must have @xmath21 , where @xmath1 is the inverse temperature , @xmath22 is the energy of the state @xmath0 , and @xmath23 is the partition function . in the problem at hand",
    "we have assigned the same energy ( say , @xmath24 ) to all states , whence the criterion for detailed balance reads simply @xmath25 .",
    "now suppose that the state @xmath0 can make transitions to @xmath26 other states .",
    "( in the above example , @xmath27 for the p - class walks and @xmath28 for the s - class walks . ) then we can choose @xmath19 equal to @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "define @xmath31 , where the sum is over the @xmath26 states @xmath20 which can be reached by a single move from the state @xmath0 . in order to make sure that probabilities sum up to @xmath32",
    ", we must introduce the probability @xmath33 for doing nothing .",
    "better yet , we can eliminate the possibility of doing nothing by renormalizing the monte - carlo time .",
    "namely , let the transition out of the state @xmath0 correspond to a monte - carlo time @xmath34 and pick the transition probabilities as @xmath35 . then the transition _ rates _",
    "( i.e. , the transition probability per unit time ) satisfies detailed balance as it should .",
    "this renormalized dynamics is clearly optimal in the sense that now the probability of leaving the state unchanged is zero , @xmath36 . in practice",
    ", the optimal choice only presents an advantage if the numbers @xmath26 are easy to evaluate ( which is the case here ) and if their values vary considerably with @xmath0 ( which is _ not _ the case here ) .",
    "accordingly , we have used only the simpler @xmath37 prescription described in the preceding paragraph .    even though we have satisfied detailed balance , a walk generated by the monte carlo process",
    "does not immediately start occurring with a probability that is independent of the initial walk . for large @xmath7 in particular , a walk generated by the process will show a great deal of structural similarity to the walk that it was created from because only two links of the walk get changed in each iteration of the process . to work around this problem a large number of walks",
    "must be generated to yield the final ensemble .",
    "below we address this important practical issue in great detail .      in evaluating the suitability of the monte - carlo algorithm for statistical studies of compact polymers the following issues",
    "must be addressed : 1 .",
    "does the process generate all possible hamiltonian walks on a given lattice ? 2 .",
    "is the sampling as described in the previous section truly unbiased ? 3 .",
    "how rapidly do descendant structures lose memory of the initial structure ? 4 .  how does the processing time to generate a fixed number of walks scale with the number of lattice sites ?",
    "the first two questions relate to issues of ergodicity and detailed balance which both need to be satisfied so that structures are sampled correctly .",
    "the last two questions pertain to the efficacy with which the algorithm can generate uncorrelated structures that can be used in computations of ensemble averages .",
    "below we give detailed answers to these questions .",
    "we have been unable to provide a general proof of ergodicity , i.e. , that the monte - carlo process can generate all possible hamiltonian walks on square lattices of arbitrary size .",
    "however , we have observed that the process successfully generates all of the possible walks on square lattices of size @xmath12 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath39 and @xmath40 lattices , all possible `` combinations '' of end point locations are possible , while on smaller lattices only walks with corner - corner , core - corner , and corner - edge combinations are allowed . whether endpoints are on edges , corners , or in the bulk of the lattice is important because it determines how many links might be drawn from an endpoint which in turn determines the probability of making a monte - carlo step away from the current structure .",
    "both @xmath39 and a @xmath40 lattices have @xmath41 , which is the largest possible @xmath15 on the square lattice . in this sense",
    ", we consider these two lattices representative of larger lattices .",
    "it should also be noted that the algorithm is likely to exhibit parity effects .",
    "this is linked to the fact that a square lattice can be divided into two sublattices ( even and odd ) .",
    "namely , on a lattice of @xmath7 sites , the two end points must necessarily reside on opposite ( resp .",
    "equal ) sublattices if @xmath7 is even ( resp .",
    "odd ) . to see this ,",
    "note that when moving along the walk from one end point to the other , the site parity must change exactly @xmath42 times .",
    "in particular , only when @xmath7 is even can the two end points be adjacent on the lattice .",
    "it is therefore reassuring to have tested ergodicity for both @xmath43 and @xmath6 lattices .    to test whether or not the process generates unbiased samples , @xmath44 compact polymer conformations",
    "were generated on a @xmath40 lattice .",
    "all different conformations were identified and the number of occurrences of each identified conformation was counted .",
    "the number of conformations on a @xmath40 lattice is known by exact enumeration to be @xmath45 @xcite , and our algorithm indeed generates all of these . using a method similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite we construct the histogram of the frequency with which each one of the @xmath46 possible conformations occurs .",
    "this histogram is then compared to the relevant binomial distribution .",
    "namely , if each conformation occurs with equal probability @xmath47 then the probability of a given conformation occurring @xmath48 times in @xmath49 trials is @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ binomial ] we compare @xmath51 to the distribution constructed from the actual @xmath40 sample . a close correspondence between the predicted distribution and the distribution constructed from the monte - carlo data is evident from the figure , indicating no detectable sampling bias in this case .",
    ".the probability @xmath52 that the walk s two end points are adjacent on an @xmath53 lattice , as obtained by exact enumeration ( see text ) and by the monte carlo method . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the variance of the fraction of residues participating in secondary structure is shown in fig .",
    "it clearly decreases with @xmath7 in a power - law fashion .",
    "a linear fit on the log - log plot reveals that the variance scales as @xmath54 , regardless of the definition of secondary structure employed .",
    "this result indicates that for compact polymers on the square lattice the fraction of residues participating in secondary structure has a well defined long chain limit given by @xmath55 .    in order to quantify how closely the histograms in fig .",
    "[ dist ] approach a gaussian distribution , the percent of residues participating in secondary structure is plotted against a normally distributed random variable .",
    "these plots appear as insets in fig .",
    "[ dist ] , and a straight line indicates a gaussian distribution .",
    "note that deviations from a straight line appear in the tails of the distributions .",
    "we attribute this primarily to the influence of the initial `` plough '' configuration on the sampled walks .",
    "this we verified by comparing histograms for the participation fraction constructed from three different ensembles of compact polymers which differed by the number of monte - carlo steps taken before sampling is initiated .",
    "as the initial wait time for the sampling to commence is increased we find that the deviations from the gaussian distribution decrease . in fact , in order to lose memory of the initial plough state , we found the wait time to be of the order of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the measured correlation time .    in order to understand the degree to which global compactness , as opposed to local connectivity , of the chains",
    "is responsible for the formation of helices we investigated the set of all @xmath58 motifs that can be observed in a compact polymer configuration .",
    "namely , on a @xmath58 section of square lattice there are 7 possible bonds that can be drawn , which means there are @xmath59 different @xmath58 motifs . of course",
    ", not all of these are compatible with a compact polymer configuration .",
    "for example , motifs with all bonds present or no bonds present could not be part of a valid hamiltonian walk .",
    "in fact we found 67 allowed motifs , of which only two are helices .",
    "therefore , the naive assumption that each of the allowed motifs appears with an equal probability would lead to the expectation of only 3% of residues participating in helix motifs . by comparison ,",
    "simulations of long chains place the expected value near 28% .    to further assess the importance of being compact for the emergence of secondary structures , we generated ensembles of random walks and self - avoiding random walks and compared their helix - content to that of hamiltonian walks .",
    "random walks were generated simply from a series of random steps on the square lattice .",
    "self - avoiding walks were sampled using a monte - carlo process based on the pivot algorithm @xcite .",
    "the results of these computations are shown in fig .",
    "[ cprwsaw ] .    as might be expected , based on the results stated above , the measured helix content is self averaging ( its distribution becomes narrower with increasing @xmath7 ) , for all three polymer models .",
    "this is explicitly seen in the insets in fig .",
    "[ cprwsaw ] where we plot the variance of the fractional helix content distribution .",
    "we find that there is a clear difference in the average helical content of random walks and self - avoiding walks compared to hamiltonian walks .",
    "the three different polymer models have 8% , 11% , and 28% helical content , respectively , in the long chain limit .",
    "in this paper we describe and test a monte - carlo algorithm for sampling compact polymers on the square lattice .",
    "the algorithm is based on the `` backbite '' move introduced by mansfield @xcite for the purpose of simulating a many - chain polymer melt .",
    "we demonstrate that the algorithm satisfies detailed balance which ensures that all the accessible states are sampled with the correct weight .",
    "while we have been unable to prove the ergodicity of the algorithm for large lattice sizes a number of numerical tests seem to indicate its validity .",
    "furthermore , we measure the efficacy of the algorithm and find that the computational effort ( measured in monte - carlo steps per site ) grows slightly faster than linear with the polymer length . in practice , using a pentium - based workstation , it takes roughly an hour to sample 10000 statistically independent compact polymer configurations for a chain 2500 monomers in length .",
    "we employ this algorithm in studies of secondary structure of compact polymers on the square lattice , in the long chain limit .",
    "our results complement the results found previously for short chains by chan and dill @xcite .",
    "namely , we show that the fraction of residues participating in secondary structure has a well defined long - chain limit that is strictly less than one . looking at helix content alone , we find that helices are twice as likely to appear in long compact chains then in random walks or self - avoiding walks . in the context of real proteins",
    "this result suggests that hydrophobic collapse to a compact native state might in large part be responsible for the observed preponderance of secondary structures .    the monte - carlo algorithm described here for two - dimensional compact polymers",
    "can be easily extended to three dimensions , and various kinds of interactions between the monomers can be introduced .",
    "this will amount to assigning different energies to different compact chains for which a metropolis - type algorithm with the backbite move can be employed .",
    "how well the algorithm performs in these situations remains to be seen ."
