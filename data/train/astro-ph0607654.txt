    "recent progress in reverberation mapping of type - i ( broad emission lines ) active galactic nuclei ( agns ) provide a reliable method for deriving the size of the broad line region ( blr ) as a function of the optical continuum luminosity , the  line luminosity , the ultraviolet continuum luminosity and the x - ray ( 210 kev ) luminosity ( kaspi et al . 2005 , hereafter k05 and references therein ) .",
    "this has been used in numerous papers to obtain a `` single epoch '' estimate of the black hole ( bh ) mass by combining the derived blr size with a measure of the gas velocity obtained from emission line widths , e.g. fwhm ( ) ( e.g. netzer 2003 ; vestergaard 2004 ; shemmer et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter s04 ; baskin and laor 2005 ) .",
    "there are obvious limitations to such methods due to the scatter in the blr size , the source luminosity and line width .",
    "these translate to a factor of 23 uncertainty on the derived masses when using the  line width as the velocity measure and the optical continuum luminosity ( @xmath6 at 5100 , hereafter ) for estimating the blr size .",
    "the uncertainty is larger , and perhaps systematic , when other emission lines are used .",
    "additional uncertainties are associated with the currently limited luminosity range , @xmath7@xmath8 ^-1 ergs s@xmath9 , thus mass determination for very luminous sources must be based on extrapolation .",
    "notwithstanding the uncertainties , such methods can provide bh mass and accretion rate in large agn samples that can not be obtained in any other way .",
    "this paper follows several earlier studies of type - i agns in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; see york et al .",
    "2000 ) spectroscopic archive .",
    "the main aims are to obtain bh masses and accretion rates for a large number of such sources and to understand the time evolution and the metal content of the blr gas .",
    "earlier studies of this type include , among others , mclure and jarvis ( 2002 ) and mclure and dunlope ( 2004 ) .",
    "here we use the latest sdss public data archive and a much larger number of sources compared with earlier studies .",
    "this enables us to obtain statistically significant correlations for various sub - samples of the data .",
    "we also introduce new , more robust methods for measuring the emission lines thus enabling more reliable study of metalicity and accretion rate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce our sample and explain the method of analysis and the various measurements performed on the sdss spectra . in  3 we show the more important correlations pertaining to type - i sources and in  4 we give a discussion of the main results , including the derived redshift dependent accretion rate which we compare with the known star formation rate over the same redshift interval .",
    "the present sample contains all broad line agns in the sdss sample from data release 4 ( dr4 , see adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) with a redshift cut at @xmath10 .",
    "this more than doubles the number of such sources in dr3 ( schneieder et al .",
    "the sources are defined as qsos by the target selection algorithm but will be addressed here as type - i agns .",
    "the limit of 0.75 is dictated by the wavelength band of the sdss spectroscopy and is designed to allow the measurement of the  and  lines and the 5100  continuum in all sources .",
    "the inclusion of  is required for different line velocities and for omitting very few sources with such weak broad lines that they are confused with type - ii agns .",
    "the requirement on  is motivated by the work of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and k05 which present the only available reverberation mapping sample .",
    "this low redshift sample includes  and  measurements for 35 sources and much fewer uv line and continuum measurements .",
    "the blr size is obtained from the measured  lag ( or a combination of @xmath11 and  lags ) and the velocity from the observed fwhm ( ) .",
    "different lines have been used in several other papers ( e.g. vestergaard 2004 ; vestergaard and peterson 2006 ) yet their use is more problematic since it requires a secondary calibration against  and . of the two uv lines",
    "most commonly used ,  is probably more reliable ( e.g. mclure and jarvis 2002 ; mclure and dunlop 2004 ) and  suffers from various systematic effects ( baskin and laor 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "we limit the present study to the use of  and defer the study of higher redshift agns , based on the  line , to a later publication .    the sdss archive ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) was queried for qsos with @xmath0 .",
    "this returned 14554 objects out of which 1212 were found to have problematic mask data ( spectra with more than 30% flagged pixels ; see stoughton et al .",
    "table 11 for details ) .",
    "these objects are not included in the analysis .",
    "we decided to stick with the original magnitude limit of the sample at the time of target selection .",
    "this means that qsos which are fainter than @xmath12=19.1 in the target database , but were later added to the best database due to improved photometry , or objects that were added to the qso database after their spectra were examined as different science targets ( thus listed as @xmath13 by the sdss target selection algorithm ; see  4.8.4 and table 27 in stoughton et al . ) were not included .",
    "this removes 1927 additional sources from the sample leaving 11415 sources with @xmath14 .",
    "the spectra of all sources were corrected for galactic extinction using the dust maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) model .",
    "next , pixels with problematic mask values ( as defined above ) are replaced by local interpolation and the spectra are de - redshifted and put on a uniform wavelength scale of 1  per pixel .",
    "our work make use of the sdss spectra as obtained from the archive without any attempt to subtract the galaxy contribution .",
    "this introduces some uncertainties at the low luminosity end of the sample and is addressed below in those cases where we consider it to be important for the derived correlations .",
    "the general issue of stellar contribution to agn spectra of various luminosities is discussed in bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the emission lines measured in this work are ,  and the feii line complex between the wavelengths of 4000 and 5300 .",
    "we first fit a linear continuum between two continuum bands : 44304440and 50805120 .",
    "this continuum is subtracted from the spectrum and a five gaussian model is fitted to the profiles of the two [ oiii ] lines and .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath15  lines are forced to have their theoretical intensity ratio ( 3.0 ) , the same fwhm and their known wavelengths .",
    "the  line is fitted with two broad gaussians and a single narrow gaussian with fwhm and wavelength that agree with the [ oiii ] lines to within 200 ^-1 kms@xmath9 . at this stage ,",
    "the narrow  component is not allowed to exceed 0.7 the intensity of .",
    "the broad  gaussians are limited to fwhm of 15005000 ^-1 kms@xmath9  and a shift of up to 500 ^-1 kms@xmath9  relative to .",
    "these first limits are necessary in order to avoid the inclusion of some neighboring feii lines , mostly on the blue side of the  profile , and to properly model the broad  components .",
    "the next step involves fitting and deblending of feii lines .",
    "the boroson & green ( 1992 ; hereafter bg92 ) fe ii emission template was convolved with a single gaussian , which has _ the same fwhm _ as the broad from the previous fit .",
    "the resulting feii model is fitted to the spectra over the region 44004650 .",
    "this region was chosen to minimize the effect of contamination with , heii@xmath16 and .",
    "next we measure the contribution of the feii lines to the previously defined continuum bands , subtract this and refit the continuum .",
    "the entire procedure is repeated and the newly defined feii template is subtracted from the continuum - subtracted spectrum .",
    "this leaves us with a feii - free spectrum .",
    "the final stage involves , again , a five gaussian fit to the [ oiii ] and  lines . at this stage",
    "we relax the conditions and allow a broader range of gaussians ( as narrow as the  line and as broad as 20,000 ^-1 kms@xmath9 ) , and a larger shift between the narrow  and  ( 450 ^-1 kms@xmath9 ) .",
    "the 20,000 ^-1 kms@xmath9  limit is required since almost all cases exceeding this limit are found to show poor quality fits ( see below ) .",
    "we also allow shifts of up to @xmath17 ^-1 kms@xmath9  between each of the two broad  components and the wavelength of the narrow  line .",
    "all line and continuum measurements used later in the statistical analysis are based on the final stage of the fit and the second feii fit .",
    "we found this multi - stage method to be more robust , and less prone to fitting inaccuracies compared with a single - stage fit of all line and components .",
    "regarding fwhm ( ) , we use an `` intrinsic '' line width which is obtained by properly subtracting a uniform instrumental line width of fwhm=140 ^-1 kms@xmath9 .",
    "we have decided not to include in the fit the blue wing commonly observed in the line profile .",
    "this removes a potential complication due to blending with the broad  profile and is also in line with earlier measures of the line in type - i and type - ii sources .",
    "as explained in greene & ho ( 2005 ) , a single component  line is a good indicator of @xmath4 .",
    "this point is further discussed in  3.5 .",
    "we do not include in the analysis the  line which is clearly seen in many of the sources .",
    "as for the broad  line , we measure its rest equivalent width ( ew ( ) ) and fwhm ( ) and also divide the combined line profile into two parts , at the rest wavelength of 4862  ( as determined by the wavelength of ) .",
    "the line flux is then measured in each part .",
    "we note that some earlier works followed bg92 and use ew(feii ) as a replacement for the iron line intensities . here",
    "we define l(feii ) by integrating the line flux over the wavelength range of 44344684  ( e.g. s04 ) . in",
    "what follows feii/  stands for l(feii)/l ( ) .",
    "the automated procedure to measure line and continuum fluxes suffers from various problems and limitations , some that are difficult to cure . to allow better control of the fit results , we make use of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 statistics ( both per degree of freedom ) .",
    "these are combined in various ways to reject sources that do not fall within the predefined limits of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a common problem is encountered in weak flux sources with very large fwhm ( ) . in many of these cases , mostly those at small redshift , the stellar contribution to  is of the same order as the non - stellar continuum .",
    "the poor signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in some of those makes it difficult to properly fit the low contrast  profile .",
    "a similar problem occurs with very broad low contrast feii blends which can result in erroneous , very large feii/. such objects are usually found and rejected by their small value of @xmath18 .",
    "given the strong dependence of luminosity on redshift , it is not surprising that such problems are less common at higher redshifts .",
    "thus , the fit quality at high redshift is usually better even in sources that have low s / n due to being close to the flux limit of the sample . our rather conservative approach results in the rejection of about 13% of all sources due to poor fits",
    ". relaxing those criteria to include about half of the rejected sources in the analysis change very little the conclusions of the paper .",
    "radio information is readily available from the sdss archive that provides first ( first images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ) data for all sources ( e.g. richards et al .",
    "2002 ; mclure and jarvis 2004 ) .",
    "this enables us to divide the sample into radio loud ( rl ) and radio quiet ( rq ) agns .",
    "the final sample that it analyzed here includes 9818 sources out of which 812 are rl - agns .",
    "its luminosity distribution as a function of redshift is shown in fig.[fig : m_z_mdot ] .",
    "the combination of  and fwhm ( ) was converted to bh mass using the most recent reverberation mapping results of k05 .",
    "this gives @xmath22 ^{0.65 }       \\left [ \\frac { fwhm(h_{\\beta})}{1000 \\,km / sec } \\right ] ^2 \\,\\ , \\msun \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : m_l}\\ ] ] the slope chosen here ( 0.65 ) is obtained from the r@xmath23   relationship of k05 .",
    "more recent papers ( vestergaard and peterson 2006 ; bentz et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest a flatter slope ( 0.52 ) based on improved host galaxy subtraction in several of the low luminosity sources in the k05 sample , and the omission of several sources from the original list .",
    "we note that the inclusion of all the k05 sources in the bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analysis , using the bces method ( see the bentz et al . paper for explanation and their table 1 for results ) gives a slope of @xmath24 which is entirely consistent with the k05 slope of @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , there are other reasons for choosing a slope steeper than 0.52 , e.g. using l ( ) as a proxy for the uv continuum luminosity ( which is not affected by the host galaxy subtraction ) gives such a slope . finally , removing several of the faintest sources from the k05 sample",
    "also justifies this slope .",
    "for example , in 91% of the sources in our sample @xmath26 ^-1 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "thus it is justified not to include the k05 sources with @xmath27 ^-1 ergs s@xmath9   when searching for the most suitable reverberation mapping relationship for the sdss sample ( this also avoids complications due to host galaxy contamination ) .",
    "this smaller sample produces a relationship very similar to the one given by eqn .",

    "estimates of @xmath29 requires further assumptions about the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , in particular the luminosity of the unobserved , extreme uv continuum .",
    "this issue has been discussed in great detail in numerous publication .",
    "estimates for @xmath29 in type - i agn range between 5 and about 13 ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "1994 ; kaspi et al . 2000 ; netzer 2003 ; marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; s04 ) .",
    "excluding dust reprocessed radiation ( that was included in the elvis et al .",
    "1994 sed ) , the range is about 510 .",
    "there are clear indications from general considerations of the agn luminosity function ( marconi et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as from direct spectroscopy ( e.g. scott et al . 2004 ; shang et al . 2005 ) , that the shape of the sed is luminosity dependent and the ratio is larger in lower luminosity agns . since the exact luminosity dependence is not known ( see however marconi et al .",
    "2004 , fig . 3 for a specific suggestion )",
    "we adopt a constant ratio of @xmath30 which is roughly the mean between the value deduced for weak and strong uv bump sources .",
    "a more advance analysis can involve the actual marconi et al . values .",
    "for the range of  considered here ( fig .",
    "1 ) , this would cover the range @xmath31 .",
    "the rest of this paper includes various diagrams involving mass , luminosity and accretion rate of agns at different redshifts . despite the specific expressions given in eqns .",
    "[ eq : m_l ] and [ eq : mdot ] , none of those correlations is trivial since the dependence of luminosity on the bh mass is unknown a priori . our work can be considered as a study of the four dimensional distribution of type - i agns along the coordinates of m(bh ) , @xmath32 , metalicity and redshift .",
    "the sdss is a flux limited sample and hence many of the derived correlations are affected by its redshift dependence incompleteness . in the following we take into account the flux limit of the sample which is transformed , as appropriate , to the various correlations under study .",
    "the limits on ,  etc . are obtained from the ( reddening corrected ) @xmath12 , the redshifts and a k - correction that assumes @xmath33 across the wavelength range of interest ( 51008000 ) .",
    "fig.[fig : m_z_mdot ] shows bh mass as a function of redshift for all rq - agns in our sample .",
    "it confirms the well known tendency for finding larger active black holes at higher redshifts , a result that was already presented by mclure & dunlope ( 2004 ) over a wider redshift range . the lower boundary at each redshift is a clear manifestation of the strong correlation of m(bh ) and  in our flux limited sample .",
    "the diagram is very similar to the one presented in mclure & dunlope ( 2004 ) where a smaller sample and somewhat different expressions for deriving m(bh ) and  have been used . here , and in several other diagrams , we focus on two mass groups that are marked in two different colors : @xmath34  ( red , 1207 sources ) and @xmath35  ( blue , 1422 sources ) .",
    "mclure and jarvis ( 2004 ) used a sample of about 6,000 sdss qsos to investigated the mass of the central bhs as a function of radio properties .",
    "they found that rl - qsos host , on the average , more massive bh for a given optical continuum luminosity .",
    "the mean m(bh ) difference between rl - agns and rq - agns found by those authors is 0.16 dex .",
    "this was attributed to the larger mean fwhm ( ) in radio loud sources .",
    "we checked these findings by comparing the luminosity , bh mass and  for the two populations in our @xmath0 sample . using the medians of all properties",
    ", we find a difference of 0.11 dex in , a factor of 1.06 in fwhm ( ) , and a difference of 0.15 dex in m(bh ) ( the differences in the mean are somewhat larger ) .",
    "the difference in m(bh ) is , of course , the result of the differences in luminosity and line width between the two populations ( see eq . [ eq : m_l ] ) .",
    "[ fig : m_z_mdot ] also shows  vs. m(bh ) for the rq - agn sample as well as for the two mass groups .",
    "the low accretion rate limit is determined , mostly , by the flux limit of the sample .",
    "thus , we expect that more object with small are missing at higher redshifts .",
    "the highest accretion rate sources in each mass group are not affected by this limit .",
    "based of these sources we confirms that the lowest mass bhs are the fastest accretors , a result that was already noted by mclure and dunlop(2004 ) .",
    "the correlation of  with redshift for the entire sample , as well as for the two mass groups , is shown fig .",
    "[ fig : accretion_z ] .",
    "the diagram shows also two computed lower limits for each of the two groups corresponding to the flux limits of the two mass boundaries .",
    "the visual impression is somewhat misleading since much of the apparent correlation is due to the lower limit on  resulting from the flux limits on the various mass groups .",
    "the presence of such flux limits considerably complicate the analysis and we have searched for rigorous ways to derived the intrinsic z-  dependence . below",
    "we detail the two methods that were used , the peak of the  distribution and the efron and petrosian ( 1992 ) truncated permutation test .",
    "we first study the distribution of  in several redshifts bins that are just wide enough to include a reasonable number of sources .",
    "these histograms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : histogram_m4_m5_m6 ] ) are used to define the peak and the envelope of the  vs. redshift relationship .",
    "the bins are defined such that @xmath36 and include from 50 to 230 sources , with an average number of about 120 sources per bin .",
    "such a procedure is only meaningful if the peak of the distribution is clearly defined , i.e. if the value of  corresponding to the maximum number of sources is _ larger _ than the accretion rate imposed by the flux limits of the sample .",
    "there are four such limits for each bin : two corresponding to the redshift boundaries and two to the mass boundaries .",
    "the largest of those four ( i.e. the most conservative limits ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram_m4_m5_m6 ] for each of the two mass groups and several redshift bins . as evident from the diagram ,",
    "the peaks of the  distribution in the lower mass group ( bottom part of the diagram ) are only meaningful for @xmath37 . beyond this redshift",
    "the method is not applicable since the sdss survey is not deep enough to properly sample many sources and the limiting  is larger than the value at the peak . the larger mass group ( top panel ) is less problematic and the histograms show that the peaks are well defined for @xmath38 .",
    "the z=0.2 histogram ( not shown here ) can also be used to define the peak .    as an independent check on the slope of the correlation in those redshift intervals where the peak distribution can be identified",
    ", we also used the upper envelope of the distribution which we define by the fifth largest  ( the number of sources with larger  is so small in some groups that we suspect incomplete sampling ) .",
    "obviously , the upper envelop is not affected by the flux limit of the sample .",
    "however , the redshift bins must contain enough sources to justify this method .",
    "this may be a problem for very high luminosity sources at low redshift because of the limited area covered by the sdss sample .",
    "the results of the test are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : envelope_peak ] .",
    "we also show the peaks of the distribution for a third mass group , with m@xmath39 , for those redshifts where the peak of the   distribution is higher than the flux limit of this group . in this mass range , this is only true for @xmath40 since there are very few such low mass sources at higher redshifts because of the flux limit .",
    "the results can be presented as simple power - laws in redshift ranging from @xmath41 for for m(bh)=@xmath42  to about @xmath43 for m(bh)=@xmath44 .",
    "given the small number of points in the various redshift intervals , and the differences between the slopes obtained from the peaks and the envelopes of the various histograms , we estimate an uncertainty of about 0.3 on the slopes obtained with this method .",
    "the determination of bivariate distributions from truncated astronomical data is a well known problem .",
    "such data sets are very common and the flux limited sample considered here is only one such example . the problem is to test such truncated bivariate data sets for statistical independence without a priori knowledge of the real underlying correlation .",
    "this issue is discussed in great detail by efron & petrosian ( 1992 ; see this paper for earlier attempts to address this issue ) who suggest powerful nonparametric permutation tests that can be applied to data sets of this type .",
    "the paper describes tests for nontruncated as well as truncated data sets and apply them to two astronomical cases that are rather similar to the sample in question . in particular , they describe a rank - based statistics that is powerful , robust and easily administrated to data sets like ours .    the normalized rank statistic of efron and petrosian ( 1992 ) , @xmath45 , is used to define a test statistic @xmath46 where w@xmath47 is a vector of weights .",
    "@xmath48 has mean 0 and variance 1 and is distributed normally thus allowing to obtain the best value and the confidence limits using the normal approximation ( see efron & petrosian 1992  3 for more details and definitions ) .",
    "the choice made here , and recommended also in efron & petrosian ( 1992 ) , assumes equal weights for all points , i.e. w@xmath49 . the application of the permutation test involves a guess of the real distribution which recovers the null hypothesis of independence between the two variables in questions ( in our case  and z ) .",
    "we have used truncated permutation tests to check two families of ad hoc luminosity redshift dependences : @xmath50 and @xmath51 this involved changing the guessed values of @xmath3 and @xmath52 , for various mass groups , and looking for their best values ( i.e. those @xmath3 and @xmath52 resulting in @xmath53 ) as well as the 90% confidence limits ( those value giving @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the mass groups used were limited to be 0.2 dex wide except for the lowest mass group , around m(bh)=@xmath42 , where the small number of objects dictates a wider range ( 0.4 dex ) .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 where we also specify the redshift range for each group ( the largest mass group contains no objects at small z and the lowest mass group contains very few sources at @xmath56 hence the need to define a redshift range ) .    the results of the test are shown in fig .",

    "[ eq : ledd_z_1 ] .",
    "they are consistent with the results of the peak distribution method and lend support to the interpretation that the peak of the distribution has indeed been recovered for the mass groups and redshift intervals discussed above .",

    "the main new results presented here are the measurement of the accretion rate , in several mass groups , as a function of redshift and the correlation between black hole growth rate and blr metalicity .",
    "the new results concerning the iron abundance and the growth time can be combined to infer the changes in the metal abundance of the blr gas as a function of time .",
    "since feii/  is an iron abundance indicator which depends on , and since most type - i agns had higher accretion rate episodes in their past , we can not avoid the conclusion that those past episodes were characterized by enhanced metalicity relative to the one measured here . computing bh growth times for the 31 high luminosity sources in s04 , and noting the dependence of n / c on  found by those authors , results in a similar conclusion , despite of the much larger redshifts of these sources .",
    "thus , blr metalicity can go through cycles and is not monotonously decreasing with decreasing redshift .    the emerging picture of a complex metalicity , accretion rate and cosmic time dependences is not easy to explain .",
    "one possibility is that episodes of fast accretion onto the central bh are associated with enhanced , large scale star formation episodes that lead to increased metalicity throughout the host galaxy or at least in its central kpc .",
    "if the enriched material finds its way to the center of the system , increasing both  and the metal content of the blr , it would explain all observed properties .",
    "such a scenario must also involve ejection and/or accretion of the enriched gas toward the end of the active phase such that the metal content of the blr at later times , when the fast accretion phase is over , is reduced relative to the peak activity phase .",
    "the formation of enriched blr clouds from the wind of an enriched accretion disk is just one of several such possibilities .",
    "the ( somewhat uncertain ) dependence of feii/  on redshift suggests that the general , time averaged blr iron abundance is slowly increasing with cosmic time while undergoing much larger fluctuations associated with the fast accretion rate episodes . finally , if the time scale of channeling such enriched starburst gas into the center is short compared with one episode of bh growth , we would expect to see strong starburst activity associated with the bh activity in many agns .      our new results clearly show the changes in bh mass and accretion rate with redshift .",
    "for example , the histograms shown in fig .  [ fig : histogram_m4_m5_m6 ] clearly illustrate that the smaller bhs are the fastest accretors at all redshifts studied here although large mass bhs at high z can accrete as fast as small mass bhs at low z.    given the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : envelope_peak ] and listed in table 1 , we can compare the bh accretion rates found here and the known star formation rate over the redshift interval of 00.75 .",
    "for this we use eqns .",
    "[ eq : ledd_z_1 ] and [ eq : ledd_z_2 ] and various publications describing evolutionary models and star formation rate measurements ( e.g. chary & elbaz 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "a simple fit to some of those results gives @xmath58 or @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the large range of slopes represents the uncertainties on the data as well as on the various evolutionary models ( see chary & elbaz 2001 for more information ) .",
    "this is a universal rate averaged over all starburst galaxies of all morphologies and luminosities .",
    "the range of slopes is somewhat narrower than the one found here for bh growth rates ( table 1 ) and the middle of the range is in rough agreement with the growth rate of m=@xmath62  bhs .",
    "thus , the average bh growth rate for @xmath0 agns seems to agree with the star formation rate over the same redshift interval .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2004 ) used a detailed modeling of several observed agn luminosity functions to argue that accretion onto bhs , integrated over the entire agn population , proceeds at a rate similar to the star formation rate at small redshifts .",
    "their model fitting to the data over the redshift range 00.6 , assuming = 1 , can be described by @xmath63 ( a. marconi , private communication ) . obviously , the marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) results can not be directly compared with ours .",
    "their total accretion rate ( i.e. luminosity ) was calculated for the entire agn population and the redshift dependence was obtained under the assumption of a uniform .",
    "the new results shown here go one step further by neglecting the uniform  assumption and by demonstrating that different mass groups are characterized by different growth rates .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the two studies requires an additional information about sources that are missing from the sdss data but are found in x - ray selected samples .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
