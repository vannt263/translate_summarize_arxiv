    "we consider the propagation of elastic waves across a medium containing randomly distributed circular inclusions , the size of which is similar to that of the wavelength",
    ". the effective field , which is obtained by averaging the fields in all the possible disordered configurations , corresponds to that of waves propagating in an effective homogeneous medium .",
    "there exists three possible approaches for obtaining the effective wavenumbers ( and equivalently , the effective phase velocity and attenuation ) :    * theoretical approach , based on multiple - scattering models such as the foldy @xcite , waterman - truell @xcite , and fikioris - waterman @xcite models .",
    "it provides closed - form expressions useful in practical applications .",
    "the main assumption is that the scatterer concentration is low , i.e. typically less than 10 % @xcite . at higher concentrations ,",
    "more sophisticated models developed in acoustics by linton and martin @xcite , and extended to elastodynamics by conoir and norris @xcite , are required .",
    "but , to our knowledge , no rigorous error estimate is available , and the limits of validity are not accurately known ; * experimental approach @xcite .",
    "it introduces no limitation about the concentration of scatterers , but it is very difficult to control accurately the various parameters involved : positions and geometries of scatterers , values of the physical parameters ; * numerical approach @xcite .",
    "it allows a simpler control of the parameters and is fast ; in practice , however , specific tools are required to perform efficient numerical computations and to render the numerical artifacts much smaller than the quantities of physical interest .",
    "the first aim of the present paper is to describe a numerical approach of this kind .",
    "the second aim is to highlight the efficiency of this methodology to explore the validity domain and limitations of analytical multiple scattering models @xcite .    for this purpose",
    ", we will proceed as follows . in section [ secrandom ] ,",
    "the problem of obtaining random configurations is discussed ; naive algorithms converge slowly when the scatterer concentrations are greater than 40 % .",
    "the statistical behavior of the configurations is determined by performing a detailed analysis of the radial distribution function . in section [ secsimu ] ,",
    "time - domain numerical methods are introduced .",
    "elastodynamic equations are integrated using a high - order finite - difference time - domain scheme whose numerical artifacts are known in the case of a homogeneous medium .",
    "the discretization of the interfaces between the host matrix and the scatterers is a key issue : special care has to be taken here to prevent the interfaces to introduce large numerical artifacts for physical , geometrical and numerical reasons @xcite . in section [ sectds ] ,",
    "signal - processing tools are applied to the simulated data , yielding the effective wavenumbers .",
    "this numerical method is applied to a simple model of concrete , consisting of mortar containing composite inclusions @xcite . in section [ secexp ] ,",
    "numerical experiments are performed at various inclusion concentrations ( ranging from 3 % to 60 % ) , with longitudinal and transverse incident plane waves .",
    "studies are performed to ensure that the averaged field obtained from a finite number of disordered configurations is representative of the theoretical effective field . in section [ secres ] , wavenumbers are extracted from the simulated data .",
    "comparisons are made with multiple - scattering models in terms of the concentration and the adimensional frequency .",
    "in particular , the advantages of recent developments over the traditional waterman - truell model are confirmed . in section [ secconclu ] ,",
    "conclusions are drawn and some future lines of research are described .",
    "technical details about the computation of theoretical wavenumbers are given in the appendix [ appeff ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the wt and cn models are often referred to as second - order models , because of the second - order taylor expansion ( [ kelown0 ] ) used to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "however , to our knowledge , this definition has never been justified either theoretically or experimentally .",
    "we will therefore examine this question numerically .",
    "let us assume @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the effective wavenumber obtained in the numerical simulations .",
    "the difference between the numerical and the theoretical results are defined by @xmath3 & = & \\displaystyle a^2\\|n_{0}\\left(\\delta_{1,\\beta}-d_{1,\\beta}\\right)+(n_{0})^2\\left(\\delta_{2,\\beta}-d_{2,\\beta}\\right)\\|+ \\mathcal{o}(n_{0}^3 ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the wavenumber deduced from the wt or cn model .",
    "this difference is plotted at various dimensionless frequencies versus the concentration @xmath5 in figure [ fig : distance ] . with the wt model , @xmath6 is governed throughout the whole frequency and concentration range by a slope of 2 decades per decade on a log - log scale :",
    "@xmath6 therefore depends mainly on @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "the wt model predicts @xmath8 inaccurately , even at low densities .",
    "in fact , there is no reason why the wt model should be preferred to the isa model , which is only a first - order model . with the cn model",
    ", @xmath6 is independent of the inclusion concentration up to @xmath9 , and has a + 3 slope on log - log scale .",
    "this confirms the accuracy of the second - order coefficient @xmath8 obtained with the hole correction .",
    "when @xmath10 was calculated using an implicit formulation to obtain the wavenumber ( [ equ : systmod ] ) , @xmath10 was found to have the same concentration - dependent properties with both the wt and the cn models ( @xmath11-curves in figure [ fig : distance ] ) .",
    "the implicit formulation did not improve the quality of the results , and cn is therefore an intrinsically - second - order model .",
    "the effective properties of random elastic media were calculated here using purely numerical methods . combining sophisticated methods of simulation (",
    "the fourth - order ader scheme and the immersed interface method ) and signal processing tools yielded reference solutions for both the real and imaginary parts of the effective wavenumbers . with this approach ,",
    "the accuracy of the simulations does not depend on the scatterer concentration .",
    "maximum computational efficiency is obtained by performing domain decomposition and parallelizing the algorithms .",
    "this numerical method was applied in the present study to a 2-d model of concrete . in this case",
    ", the numerical simulations confirmed that traditional models ( such as the waterman - truell model ) are valid roughly up to inclusion densities of 10% , whereas the recent conoir - norris ( extension of linton - martin to elastodynamics ) is valid up to densities of 25 % .",
    "in particular , the present simulations confirmed the validity of the second - order term in the conoir - norris model , as previously done in a theoretical study @xcite .",
    "we hope that a similar approach can be used by researchers to test the validity of their favorite multiple - scattering model @xcite .",
    "the numerical method presented here can be used to handle more complex configurations , such as a granulometry or composite containing scatterers of various shapes .",
    "other constitutive laws could also be introduced , such as viscoelastic laws accounting for dissipative effects @xcite .",
    "lastly , the possibility of extending the present approach to 3-d configurations is a great computational challenge .",
    "preliminary tests have already been conducted on the numerical methods with fluid scatterers included in a fluid matrix .",
    "the authors wish to thank dr emilie franceschini for her helpful comments , and jessica blanc for her careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "as established in @xcite , the scattered field @xmath12 recorded at @xmath13 and due to an inclusion centered at @xmath14 can be expressed through a linear operator @xmath15 applied to the exciting field @xmath16 : @xmath17 . if the positions of the @xmath18 inclusions are known , closed - form solution of the problem can be obtained .",
    "if , on the contrary , the inclusions are randomly distributed , it is generally attempted to determine the effective field @xmath19 corresponding to the ensemble average of the positions of all the inclusions . the effective field at one representative inclusion ( say the first one ) is expressed in terms of the scattering induced by another representative inclusion ( say the second ) .",
    "based on the quasicristalline approximation ( qca ) @xcite , the latter scattered field is assumed to be excited by the same effective field as the first inclusion : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the incident field .",
    "the probability density @xmath22 in ( [ eq : ensaverage ] ) , which is a pair - correlation function , expresses the probability of finding an inclusion at @xmath23 , given that an inclusion is placed at @xmath14 .",
    "various models have been developed for determining the effective wavenumbers analytically , such as the waterman - truell ( wt ) @xcite and lloyd - berry ( lb ) @xcite models , to cite but a few . as pointed out by linton - martin @xcite",
    ", these models differ mainly in the hole correction , i.e. the assumption made about @xmath24 in the integration of ( [ eq : ensaverage ] ) .",
    "the lb model is based on the following assumption : @xmath25 1    & \\quad \\mbox{if } |{\\bf r_{2}}-{\\bf r_{1}}| > b , \\end{array } \\right . \\quad\\quad b=2\\,a+\\xi , \\label{eq : formeqca}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined in section [ secrandomalgo ] . to obtain the effective wavenumbers in @xmath28 and @xmath29 waves",
    ", the effective field can be decomposed into a modal sum , where the modal amplitude depends on the effective wavenumber @xcite . introducing this form into ( [ eq : ensaverage ] ) and using ( [ eq : formeqca ] )",
    ", the problem reduces to searching for the non - trivial solution of the infinite linear system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 31 ) ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the identity matrix , @xmath32 is a matrix defined in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the effective wavenumbers @xmath34 satisfying ( [ equ : systmod ] ) are associated with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
