    "spin models on hierarchical lattices are a large class of exactly soluble models that have been first considered as approximations to regular lattices @xcite and then as examples of lattices invariant under a real - space renormalization procedure @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group action for such models is therefore exact and the study of its dynamics provides some interesting results that can be useful in studying the renormalization group action in more general cases . in this paper",
    "we consider some examples of potts models on hierarchical lattices , namely the diamond hierarchical lattice ( ) , the spider web ( ) , the sierpinski gasket ( ) and cylinders ( ) . apart from the case of the spider web which ( to the best of the author s knowledge ) has not yet been subject of research , models on the other lattices",
    "have been extensively studied before ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) ; however , the purpose of this paper is to present all such models with a consistent and uniform method which also allows for the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this approach has been presented in a previous paper @xcite and can be applied in full generality to all hierarchical lattices . for each model we will write the exact renormalization group generator and provide numerical results for the distribution of lee - yang and fisher zeros .",
    "such results are obtained using techniques which we explain in and in the appendices .",
    "we also report some observations which arise quite naturally from the analysis of the aforementioned models and also provide some new results .",
    "in particular , we observe that lee - yang zeros responsible for the infinite susceptibility of ising model on the diamond hierarchical lattice in the paramagnetic phase are given by interactions that are only finitely renormalizable .",
    "moreover , we are able to write the exact renormalization map associated to the potts model on a sierpinski gasket for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a detailed treatment of potts models on hierarchical lattices ; what follows in this introduction is an attempt to summarize consistently all basic concepts we need in this paper .",
    "+ hierarchical lattices are infinite lattices in which we allow multiple - spin connections and that are obtained by iterating a _ decoration _ procedure on a finite lattice ; this procedure amounts to substitute each edge of a lattice with a given block of spins and edges ( see e.g. figures [ fig : dhlb],[fig : spider],[figure : sierpinski ] ) . in @xcite",
    "we showed that , for such models , we can define a renormalization map that acts as a _ polynomial map _ on the complex vector space of boltzmann weights @xmath1 associated to local interactions @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that a different normalization of the boltzmann weights or , equivalently , a different choice of zero of energies , does not change the thermodynamics of the models .",
    "therefore , we argue that the space of boltzmann weights can be considered as a projective space @xmath3 and the renormalization map will act on such projective space as a _ rational map_. in general ,",
    "if we consider models with several type of interactions , then the renormalization map will act on the cartesian product of several projective spaces ( i.e a so - called _ multiprojective space _ ) that we call _ dynamical space_. we define _ physical space _ to be the space of boltzmann weights associated to interactions given by pair interactions and ( possibly ) by coupling with an external magnetic field .",
    "in general , the physical space is a submanifold of the dynamical space which is _ not _ preserved by the renormalization map .",
    "this amounts to the well - known fact that the renormalization of pair interactions introduces new multiple - spin interactions .",
    "hierarchical lattices are such that all possible multiple - spin interactions that arise from the renormalization process form a finite - dimensional space ; in this sense we say that hierarchical lattices are exactly renormalizable .",
    "in the next sections we will perform a numerical study of rational maps that generate the renormalization group of some examples of hierarchical lattices .",
    "we are , in fact , interested in finding the distribution of lee - yang and fisher zeros for such models . given the renormalization map of the model , one method to obtain numerically such distributions is to find all basins of attraction of stable fixed points of the map ; the boundary of such regions is going to be the unstable set for the renormalization map ( i.e. the so - called julia set ) and phase transitions of the model will appear for interactions belonging to such set ( see [ basins ] for more details ) . a second approach , in some sense more straightforward , proceeds by computing an approximation of a real function called _",
    "green function_. this function is a purely dynamical object and it is related to the _ free energy _ of the model the map is associated to ; in particular we expect the two functions to have the same domain of analyticity ( although this fact has been formally proved only for some cases ) .",
    "once we obtain the numerical approximation to the green function , applying the laplacean differential operator yields the density of the measure supported on the lee - yang and fisher zeros of the model ( see [ green ] for details ) .",
    "+ as we pointed out in the introduction , the renormalization group action on boltzmann weights is generated by a rational map on a multiprojective space @xmath4 called _ dynamical space _ which contains all multiple - spin interactions that can be generated by the renormalization process .",
    "we will often consider a submanifold @xmath5 that we call _ physical space_. this submanifold is given by boltzmann weights associated to interaction that are induced by pair interactions and possibly an external magnetic field .",
    "let us define the pair interactions , i.e. let @xmath6 be the energy given to two parallel neighbouring spins and @xmath7 the energy associated to two neighbouring spins that are in different states .",
    "the boltzmann weights associated to the corresponding energies will be denoted by @xmath8 $ ] and belong to the one - dimensional complex projective space @xmath9 . a magnetic field ,",
    "if present , will assign energy @xmath10{2.4pt}{2.4pt}}}})}$ ] to one _ special _",

    "+ for each hierarchical lattice we can therefore define a map from @xmath13 that gives projective coordinates to @xmath5 . the pair interaction boltzmann weights will belong to the first @xmath9 factor and the magnetic field weight to the second @xmath9 factor .",
    "we are now going to define standard local charts ( coordinates ) on each @xmath9 factor ; all numerical computations will be performed in one of such charts .",
    "notice that all the coordinates we are going to define are just standard ( inhomogeneous ) charts on the projective line @xmath9 .",
    "we call _ standard interaction coordinates _ the coordinate chart of @xmath9 given by @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) .",
    "+ when dealing with zero - temperature phase transitions we will need to consider the inverse chart , @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 ) ; we will call such chart _ inverse interaction coordinates_.    note that the standard interaction coordinates could be obtained by setting @xmath18 and considering the boltzmann weights @xmath19 corresponding to such choice of zero of energies . in this sense",
    "we call them _ standard_. in such coordinates , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic points , while @xmath22 is the paramagnetic point .",
    "the latter is fixed by all renormalization maps , while the ferromagnetic point ( @xmath21 ) is fixed whenever the hierarchical lattice is connected ; the antiferromagnetic point is usually mapped to the ferromagnetic point by the rg map .",

    "again , the standard field coordinates can be obtained as the boltzmann weights associated to the choice @xmath24 . in the standard field coordinates , @xmath25 corresponds to the case with zero field , @xmath26 corresponds to the case of infinite field and @xmath27 is when the privileged state costs infinite energy and it is therefore never assumed .",
    "diamond hierarchical lattices ( dhls ) have been the first hierarchical lattices to be investigated using tools from complex dynamics @xcite ; they are lattices on a standard graph , and they can be obtained by iterating the _ decoration procedure _ illustrated in figure [ fig : dhlb ] .",

    "the indeterminacy set is the set of points on which the renormalization map is not defined , i.e. the points that would map to all boltzmann weights equal to @xmath53 under the renormalization map ( see @xcite ) .",
    "points accumulating on the positive real axis in correspond therefore to interactions that are only finitely renormalizable .",
    "such points are in some sense anomalous from the points of view of both dynamics and physics , and it would be quite interesting to understand if this connection is more than just a mere coincidence .",

    "this is not an issue ; the renormalization transformation is therefore easily written in the dynamical variables : @xmath59 [ spiderwebnof ] notice that , in general , the renormalization map does not preserve the physical space submanifold .",
    "once more , this amounts to the well - known fact that in general renormalizing pair interactions gives rise to interactions that can not be written as pair interactions .",
    "this did not happen in the previous case because the dhl is naturally defined using only 2-edges .",

    "( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath61@xmath62    ; as we change @xmath0 we can track the evolution of the antiferromagnetic phase.,title=\"fig:\",width=132 ] ; as we change @xmath0 we can track the evolution of the antiferromagnetic phase.,title=\"fig:\",width=132 ] ; as we change @xmath0 we can track the evolution of the antiferromagnetic phase.,title=\"fig:\",width=132 ]    we can recognize the cauliflower in the physical variables in the leftmost picture of figure [ ragnatela ] . from the map we easily see that the paramagnetic point @xmath37 $ ] is a parabolic fixed point ( i.e. its multiplier is a root of unity . ) and the convergence of the green function in its neighbourhood is rather slow .",
    "the same slow convergence rate can also be noticed for all preimages of this point .",
    "all points inside the cauliflower ( therefore all antiferromagnetic interactions ) will converge to the paramagnetic fixed point , while all points outside will converge to the ferromagnetic fixed point at infinity .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that frustration prevents the formation of an antiferromagnetic phase . for @xmath63",

    "in cases where it is easy to locate all stable fixed points of the map ( e.g. for maps on the riemann sphere @xmath87 ) , it is possible to obtain their basins of attraction in the following way .",
    "first of all we find a stable neighbourhood of each fixed point i.e. a ball of small radius such that its image is contained in itself . having fixed a maximum number of iterations , we discretize a bounded region of the _ physical space _ in a finite number of _ pixels _ , and for each pixel , we apply iteratively the map starting from the center of the pixel until we end up in one of the aforementioned stable neighbourhoods .",
    "if this happens in the given maximum number of iterations , we declare the initial pixel to belong to the _ attracting basin _ of the corresponding fixed point and we color it according to the speed of convergence ( the faster the lighter ) and to which fixed point it is attracted to . if the point does not fall in any neighbourhood in the given number of iterations , it is coloured black .",
    "+ pictures obtained in such a way show the unstable set of the map as the boundary of the basins of attraction ; moreover , showing which points are attracted to which fixed points , the pictures provide basic information on the asymptotic dynamics of the rg map .",
    "we recall that a rational map on a multiprojective space @xmath4 lifts to a polynomial map that is separately homogeneous in each factor , i.e. : @xmath88,\\cdots,[z^{(p)}]\\right)\\mapsto\\left(\\left[f^{(1)}\\left(z^{(1)},\\cdots , z^{(p)}\\right)\\right],\\cdots,[f^{(p)}\\left(z^{(1)},\\cdots , z^{(p)}\\right)]\\right ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] where each @xmath89 is such that : @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the degree of @xmath89 with respect to @xmath92 .",
    "considering @xmath91 as an integer - valued matrix @xmath93 , we can find its eigenvalues ; in good cases we expect ( via the perron - frobenius theorem ) a simple real maximal eigenvalue @xmath94 such that its associated ( normalized ) eigenvector @xmath95 has all non - negative coordinates .",
    "in such cases we can define the green function : @xmath96 notice the similarity of this function with the free energy of the system .",
    "in fact , for hierarchical lattices we have the following expression for the free energy : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the partition function of the starting hypergraph . moreover ,",
    "if we call @xmath99 the number of edges of type @xmath100 that belong to the starting hypergraph , we can express the total number of edges of the @xmath101-th approximation to the hierarchical lattice as @xmath102 .",
    "for generic @xmath103 , this expression is obviously asymptotic to @xmath104 .",
    "as explained in @xcite there are results that state that the two functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 are equal in the uniform case with mild assumptions on @xmath98 , but there is no general result for the non - uniform case . moreover notice that in the uniform case the matrix @xmath93 is just a number , therefore most of the computations are made easier .",
    "+ we remark that we can exploit the homogeneous nature of the map to obtain a clever ( and geometrically converging ) way of numerically computing the green function .",
    "in fact , let us define the sequence @xmath107 of normalized iterates and the sequence @xmath108 of the corresponding norms as follows : @xmath109 we can write : @xmath110 therefore ,",
    "iterating the previous expression we get : @xmath111 taking the logarithm and considering @xmath112 as components of a vector @xmath113 in a @xmath114-dimensional space and again @xmath91 as elements of the @xmath115-matrix @xmath93 , we obtain the following expression : @xmath116 when we compute the scalar product with the maximal eigenvector of @xmath93 we are projecting on the corresponding eigenspace , therefore the expression can be rewritten as : @xmath117 dividing by the normalization term we get the following expression for the green function : @xmath118 that is geometrically convergent ( if @xmath94 ) and can be computed numerically with very good approximation as the @xmath119 are bounded .",
