    "the goal of lattice fermion improvement schemes is to increase the effectiveness of computer algorithms by significantly reducing lattice artifacts at economically coarse lattice spacings , particularly in the range @xmath1 fm .",
    "the clover action with the clover coefficient chosen nonperturbatively @xcite ( npca ) has been found to give a substantially better scaling of the hadron spectrum over the range @xmath2 $ ] fm than the conventional wilson fermion action ( wa ) @xcite .",
    "however , as the lattice spacing is increased over this range , the npca becomes increasingly sensitive to local fluctuations in the gauge configurations that produce unwanted artifact singularities at small , positive quark mass , the so - called `` exceptional configurations . '' to avoid them , one must keep the quark mass artificially high . at increasingly coarse lattice spacing , the lower bound on `` safe '' quark masses rises , making an extrapolation to physical quark masses increasingly problematical .",
    "difficulties with such `` exceptional '' configurations are overcome in a variety of approaches , including pole shifting @xcite and schemes which implement an exact chiral symmetry on the lattice , the overlap formalism @xcite , and the domain wall approach @xcite .",
    "such methods are computationally expensive . here",
    ", we consider a new ( approximate ) improvement scheme , the `` fat clover '' action .    the `` fat clover '' action ( fca ) , proposed by degrand , hasenfratz , and kovcs @xcite , couples the standard clover action to a locally smoothed gauge field .",
    "smoothing of the gauge fields is achieved through a series of ape blocking steps @xcite .",
    "it is intended that the number of blocking steps remains fixed as the continuum limit is approached .",
    "thus the fermion - gauge coupling is modified at a scale that is a fixed multiple of the cutoff , and the correct local action is recovered in the limit . smoothing has a number of beneficial effects : lattice artifacts are suppressed , chiral properties are improved , and the renormalization of a variety of lattice quantities , such as the local - vector - current and axial - vector - current renormalization constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is small @xcite .    here",
    "we examine two variants of fat link actions : one using the tree level value for the strength of the clover term ( tfca ) and one using an optimized value ( ofca ) .",
    "( see table [ actions ] for a guide to our abbreviations . )",
    "we first study the distribution of real eigenmodes of the lattice dirac operator in an ensemble of gauge configurations , with particular attention to the `` exceptional '' eigenvalues at positive quark mass .",
    "we show that the fca has improved chiral properties , in the sense that the spread of leading near zero modes is narrower than with the npca at a lattice spacing of @xmath5 fm .",
    "thus the `` safe '' lower bound on quark masses is lower with the fca .",
    "we then present a study of fluctuations in the pion correlator as a qualitative test of the suppression of exceptional configurations in npca and tfca .",
    "finally we perform a small scaling test of the quenched hadron spectrum for the tfca and ofca .",
    "scaling is tested as the lattice constant is varied from @xmath6 fm to @xmath7 fm , choosing some fixed value of the quark mass , such that either @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the string tension , or @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "included for comparison are the corresponding results for the standard wilson action ( wa ) , nonperturbative clover action ( npca ) , and the standard wilson action on a fat link background ( fwa ) . in this scaling study",
    "we pay careful attention to the elimination of a variety of sources of systematic error : we scale all quantities with physical dimensions and fix the lattice dimensions in physical units .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : action ] we give details of the fca and our computational method . in sec .",

    "the fat clover action ( fca ) is the usual clover action @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the wilson action , and @xmath13 is the standard `` clover '' expression for the field strength tensor @xmath14 , except that all link variables in @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fat links .",
    "the fat link is constructed from the original ( `` thin '' ) links with a series of ape blocking steps @xcite .",
    "a single step creates a new gauge configuration with each gauge link replaced by a weighted sum of the link and its staples , followed by a projection back to su(3 ) .",
    "explicitly , each link @xmath15 is replaced by @xmath16.\\ ] ] where @xmath17 represents the projection , which in su(3 ) chooses the unique group element @xmath18 of su(3 ) maximizing @xmath19 .",
    "( replacement occurs after all smooth links for the lattice are computed . )",
    "this process is repeated @xmath20 times in our study with a coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "such a choice was found to give good stability in instanton size and placement during smoothing in both su(2 ) and su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "we have not explored other choices extensively , but suspect considerable latitude is permitted in the choice of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . after smoothing ,",
    "the mean plaquette of the fat link is close to 1 : for @xmath24 , the mean plaquette is @xmath25 and for @xmath26 it is @xmath27 .",
    "fat link clover actions , like all clover actions , have no @xmath28 nor @xmath29 corrections as long as the clover coefficient @xmath30 is taken to approach unity in the @xmath31 limit . in perturbation theory@xcite the effect of the fat link is to multiply the usual thin link quark - gluon vertices by a form factor @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the gluon momentum .",
    "this easily accounts for the observed considerable reduction in additive quark mass renormalization and finite renormalization constants for vector and axial currents close to unity .",
    "the clover coefficient @xmath30 is _ a priori _ unspecified .",
    "we expect , based on the near unit value of the mean plaquette , that an optimal value for simulations would be close to the tree - level value of unity , and that is what one would choose in a tadpole - based improvement program@xcite .",
    "we chose the value of @xmath30 using the approach of degrand , hasenfratz and kovas , based on the position of real eigenmodes of the dirac operator @xcite .    to locate the real eigenmodes , for each configuration we calculated a noisy estimator of the expectation value @xmath35 @xcite @xmath36 at a closely spaced series of real values @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary random vector , held constant for the scan over @xmath37 .",
    "a real eigenvalue of @xmath39 appears as a pole in @xmath40 , provided the corresponding eigenvector has nonzero overlap with the vector @xmath38 .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 would also diverge at a real eigenvalue of @xmath39 , but since the real eigenmodes of @xmath39 are also close to being eigenmodes of @xmath42 with eigenvalue @xmath43 , the factor @xmath42 helps to distinguish them .    in the continuum limit",
    "the only real eigenvalues of @xmath39 are chiral zero modes , occurring at @xmath44 , i.e. zero bare quark mass .",
    "if the lattice dirac operator is not chiral , the real modes are spread around @xmath45 ( defined as the value of @xmath37 where @xmath46 extrapolates to zero ) , and can also be shifted from the chiral @xmath47 value .",
    "such real eigenmodes are undesirable lattice artifacts that prevent lattice simulations at small quark mass",
    "configurations that produce them are called `` exceptional '' , although the problem really lies with the choice of fermion action and not with the gauge configuration itself .",
    "actions with improved chiral properties have real eigenmodes that cluster more closely around @xmath45 . for such actions it should be possible to study lower quark masses without encountering difficulties with exceptional configurations , or to carry out a simulation on a coarser lattice at the same quark mass .    for",
    "a sufficiently high degree of fattening one can optimize the clover coefficient by minimizing the spread of the real eigenmodes on monte carlo - generated configurations .",
    "in this work , however , we choose a simpler approach .",
    "we generate a series of artificial lattice instantons of varying size @xmath48 on @xmath49 lattices and of size @xmath50 on @xmath51 lattices .",
    "instanton studies at @xmath52 and @xmath53 predicted instanton sizes in this range @xcite . for each such gauge configuration , we examined the position of the resulting fermion real eigenmode .",
    "results are shown in tables [ small.tbl ] and [ large.tbl ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : zero_vs_inst_size ] . for large @xmath54",
    "the near - zero modes are quite close to zero quark mass .",
    "as @xmath54 drops below the lattice cutoff , the would - be zero mode moves toward negative quark mass .",
    "the trajectory of real eigenmodes is altered by adjusting the clover coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "we find that with @xmath55 the variation in pole position is minimized for instanton sizes in the range @xmath56 . with @xmath57",
    "the variation in pole position is minimized for @xmath58 .",
    "since our scaling test considers lattices over a range of spacings varying by a factor of 2 , we choose @xmath55 for our coarsest lattice spacing and @xmath59 for our finest lattice spacing to assure scaling consistency .",
    "we call the action with tuned clover coefficient the `` optimized fat clover action '' ( ofca ) . to test sensitivity to this choice , we also present results with the tree - level choice @xmath60 ( tfca ) .",
    "there are two parts to this study : an analysis of the distribution of low energy real eigenvalues and an analysis of the scaling of the spectrum . for studies of the distribution of near - zero eigenvalues at @xmath61 we analyzed 100 configurations of size @xmath62 , and",
    "for the companion spectrum study to relate the pion mass to the @xmath37 value , 20 configurations of size @xmath63 . for the spectrum scaling studies",
    "we have worked with two ensembles of quenched gauge configurations generated with the conventional one - plaquette wilson action : 120 configurations of size @xmath64 at @xmath24 and 100 of size @xmath65 at @xmath66 , corresponding to lattice spacing @xmath67 and @xmath6 fm , respectively , based on recent measurements of the string tension for this action in lattice units @xcite and the choice @xmath68 mev @xcite .",
    "the lattice dimensions for the scaling study were chosen to keep an approximately constant physical volume , so as to avoid inconsistent finite size effects . to allow tuning of the quark mass , either by fixing the pion mass in terms of the string tension or in terms of the rho mass",
    ", we calculate the spectrum for ( typically ) three neighboring @xmath37 values selected so that the desired dimensionless ratios can be reached by interpolation .",
    "quark propagators were generated from a fixed gaussian ( shell - model ) source with standard deviation @xmath69 for the coarsest lattice and @xmath70 for the finest .",
    "our scaling tests were computed at three values of the clover coefficient @xmath30 for each gauge coupling : @xmath59 or 1.2 , as noted above , for the ofca , @xmath60 for the tree - level fat clover action ( tfca ) , and @xmath71 for the fat wilson action ( fwa ) to test the relative merits of smoothing and reducing the o(a ) errors in the action .",
    "for each of the actions in our study we determined the distribution of the real eigenmodes on a set of 100 @xmath62 gauge configurations , generated with the conventional single plaquette action at @xmath72 .",
    "we determined the probability distribution @xmath73 of the leading pole ( i.  e. the eigenvalue corresponding to the largest quark mass ) for the various actions in our study .",
    "note that this statistic is different from the eigenvalue histograms of ref .",

    "we consider only the pole corresponding to the largest mass on each configuration , these plots are indicative of the exceptional configurations .    to compare leading - pole distributions from the various actions",
    ", we converted the @xmath37 values to @xmath74 values , by measuring the hadron spectrum with the same action on a set of 20 @xmath63 quenched configurations .",

    "[ fig : prob_leading ] .",
    "pion masses used for constructing the linear scale conversion , @xmath75 are given in tables [ kappa_scale_a ] and [ kappa_scale_b ] .",
    "the bin widths in this figure are variable , since the poles were located by scanning at the same constant increment in @xmath37 for all actions .",
    "we took this interval as the resolution of the pole location . the corresponding interval in @xmath74 , however , varied from action to action .",
    "the bin heights are scaled so that the probability distributions all have unit total area . the tfca and ofca actions clearly produce distributions that are more sharply clustered around @xmath76 .",
    "the peak for the ofca appears at a nonzero bin in @xmath74 , but we estimate a combined systematic and statistical error ( one sigma ) of one bin width arising from the conversion from @xmath37 to @xmath74 near zero pion mass .    to put these results in another perspective , we have also measured the ratio @xmath77 for these configurations . for our sample of gauge configurations at @xmath78",
    "the npca encounters its first pole at @xmath79 , the tfca , at about 0.37(6 ) and the ofca at about 0.42(5 ) .",
    "while a pole in the quark propagator at @xmath80 is the most precise indicator of an exceptional configuration , fluctuations in a hadron correlator , e.g.  the pion correlator , give a qualitative indication .",
    "poles in the quark propagator typically have residues with concentrated support in euclidean space - time . for instanton - induced poles ,",
    "localization of the residue comes from localization of the zero eigenmode .",
    "since the pion propagator is the gauge - invariant square of the quark propagator , a nearby exceptional pole typically contributes a strong localized fluctuation in the pion correlator@xmath81 in some cases inducing a `` w '' shape in a semilog plot .",
    "starting from a common sample of 80 quenched single - plaquette @xmath82 gauge configurations at @xmath24 , we compute the pion correlator for the npca and tfca for a range of quark masses .",
    "we then consider two measures of fluctuations : ( 1 ) the noise to signal ratio of the correlator at a fixed time and ( 2 ) the number of outliers , based on a correlated chi square measure .",
    "the simplest measure of fluctuations is the noise to signal ratio in a correlator , namely the ratio of the standard deviation of a correlator @xmath83 to the value of the correlator , @xmath84 , as a function of distance and/or quark ( or pion ) mass .",
    "the pseudoscalar correlator is the most useful one to look at , since simple theoretical arguments suggest that @xmath85 should be roughly independent of the quark mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_to_signal ] this ratio at @xmath86 , namely @xmath87 , is plotted over a range of @xmath77 for the npca and tfca .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath88 , fluctuations are dramatically reduced with the tfca .",
    "we denote the correlator on the @xmath89th configuration by @xmath90 and its mean over the sample of configurations by @xmath84 . for the outlier test",
    "we start by constructing the usual covariance matrix @xmath91 , based on the observed fluctuations , and its inverse @xmath92 .",
    "the correlated chi square measure for configuration @xmath89 is then @xmath93       [ c_i(t^\\prime ) - \\bar c(t^\\prime ) ] w_{t , t^\\prime}\\ ] ] for @xmath94 degrees of freedom . the corresponding confidence level is then used to determine the strength of deviation from the mean . for the sample of 80 configurations we treated the two time intervals",
    "@xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] separately .",
    "a configuration was deemed exceptional , if the confidence level determined on either interval was less than @xmath97 , a somewhat arbitrary value that was chosen to correspond to strongly discernible deviations , many of them with the `` w '' shape , characteristic of an exceptional configuration .",
    "note that a gaussian normal fluctuation at this level in a sample of 80 would be expected only once in about @xmath98 trials .",
    "the process of identifying outliers was carried out iteratively , in each pass removing the outliers from the sample as they were identified , until none remained .",
    "results are summarized in tables [ outliers_npca ] and [ outliers_tfca ] .",
    "based on this measure , if we were to insist on no more than one exceptional configuration in a sample of this size at @xmath99 , the npca would be restricted approximately to @xmath100 and the tfca to @xmath101 .",
    "correlators for the zero momentum pion , rho , nucleon , and @xmath102 were fit to single exponential forms , minimizing the correlated @xmath103 .",
    "care is needed to prevent biases arising from the choice of the fitting range , particularly from the choice of minimum time @xmath104 .",
    "we used two methods to test for bias : in fitting correlators for a set of closely spaced @xmath37 values we selected ( 1 ) the smallest @xmath104 giving a minimum cl for all @xmath37 s greater than 0.05 and an average cl greater than 0.1 ; and ( 2 ) the @xmath104 for which the product of cl and the number of degrees of freedom ( df ) is maximum , a rather ad hoc rule of thumb @xcite .",
    "as a rule both methods gave the same @xmath105 .",
    "where a different value was obtained , we determined that the variation in mass value was within the statistical errors of the fits .",
    "we found that @xmath104 for the @xmath106 lattice was generally half the value on the @xmath65 lattice .",
    "in the few cases in which it was not ( the rho meson for ofca and tfca ) , we verified that , had we enforced this further condition , the central mass value would have shifted by less than 1% , an amount smaller than the error in the observed scaling violation .",
    "our fitting range is then approximately constant in physical units , and our results are therefore free of bias from this source .",
    "we also checked the single exponential fits against two - exponential fits and verified that the results were stable within statistical errors .",
    "results of the fits are shown in table [ summary.tbl ] .",
    "we consider two alternatives for fixing the quark mass : ( 1 ) fixing @xmath107 and ( 2 ) fixing @xmath108 .",
    "these values were chosen to correspond to each other , approximately . since variations in the strength of the clover term changes the @xmath109 and @xmath110 mass splittings , so can change the pi to rho mass ratio at fixed physical quark mass , the former method is preferable .",
