    "it is widely believed today that the nontrivial qcd vacuum plays an important role in understanding the analytic properties of hadron distribution amplitudes ( da ) in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can use qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates @xcite to connect dynamic properties of ( light ) mesons , like form factors and das , directly with the qcd vacuum .",
    "the classical example is the pion da , which describes how the pion s longitudinal momentum is shared between its quark and antiquark constituents when probed at large momentum transfer @xmath8 .",
    "first , a detailed knowledge of the pion da is necessary in order to make precise calculations of `` hard - scattering '' form factors , like @xmath9 and @xmath10 and compare the results with the experimental data .",
    "second , the parton structure is interesting in its own right , providing insight into the nonperturbative hadron structure at large distances .",
    "there is a long history of determining the pion da starting from the asymptotic limit of perturbative qcd @xcite to qcd sum rules @xcite , to instanton - based models @xcite , and to lattice computations @xcite .",
    "now , with the help of the recent cleo data @xcite , one gets a handle on the pion da from the experimental side .",
    "indeed , these data can be analyzed @xcite using the framework of light cone sum rules @xcite to extract constraints on the gegenbauer coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the conformal expansion .",
    "supplementary constraints on the shape of the pion da are supplied by diffractive di - jets production events @xcite , but the uncertainties of these experimental results and their controversial theoretical interpretations @xcite are still prohibiting definite conclusions .",
    "the nonlocal quark condensate represents a partial resummation of the ope to all orders in terms of the vacuum expectation value of the nonlocal operator @xmath11_{\\rho \\sigma},\\quad \\!\\ !",
    "e(0,z )    = p\\exp\\!\\left[-ig_s\\!\\!\\int_0^z \\!\\!a_\\mu(y)dy^\\mu\\right ] ,   \\label{eq : nonq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are spinor indices and the integral in the fock  schwinger string @xmath13 is taken along a straight - line path .",
    "note that @xmath14 are analytic functions around the origin and that their derivatives at zero are related to condensates of corresponding dimension .",
    "recall that the condensates of lowest dimensions @xmath15 form the basis of the standard qcd sum rules @xcite and have been estimated , while higher - dimensional ones are yet unknown . in the chiral limit one has @xmath16 and the parameter @xmath17 fixes the width of @xmath18 around the origin .    for not too large euclidean distances",
    "@xmath19 , the nonlocality behavior of the ( quark ) condensate can be implemented by the gaussian ansatz @xcite @xmath20 in which @xmath21 has the meaning of an inverse vacuum quark correlation length .",
    "this corresponds to the specific form of the virtuality distributions @xmath22 , @xmath23  @xcite with @xmath24 this kind of virtuality distributions fix only _ one _ main property of the nonperturbative vacuum ",
    "quarks can flow through the vacuum with a nonzero momentum @xmath25 , and the average virtuality of such vacuum quarks is just @xmath26 ( for a determination of @xmath17 from lattice data , see @xcite ) .",
    "the pion da of twist 2 , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 being here the longitudinal momentum fraction ) , defined by @xmath29 can be related to the nonlocal condensates by means of the following sum rule @xmath30    where the index @xmath31 runs over all scalar , vector , and tensor condensates with dim=6 @xcite ; @xmath32 is the borel parameter , @xmath33 the duality interval in the axial channel .",
    "this sum rule allows us to determine the first ten moments @xmath34 of the pion da and independently the inverse moment @xmath35 quite accurately ( see in @xcite for an illustration ) .",
    "the corresponding gegenbauer coefficients can be determined ( see @xcite ) from this set within some error range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram]b ) that translates into a `` bunch '' of pion das shown for @xmath36  gev@xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bunch ] .",
    "their striking feature is that their endpoints are suppressed relative to both the cz model and the asymptotic solution . crudely speaking ,",
    "this shape structure is the net result of the interplay between the perturbative contribution and the non - perturbative term @xmath37 ( related to the scalar condensate ) that dominates the rhs of the sr in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlcsrda ] ) .",
    "the fact that the function @xmath37 is not singular in @xmath28 and has a dip at the central point of the interval @xmath38 $ ] is also reflected in the shapes of these das .",
    "we emphasize that a suppression of the endpoint region as strong as possible ( for a dedicated discussion we refer to @xcite ) is important in order to improve the self - consistency of perturbative qcd in convoluting the pion da with the specific hard - scattering amplitude for a particular exclusive process . in order to stress this point",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : endpoint ] @xmath39 , calculated as @xmath40 and normalized to @xmath41 ( @xmath42-axis ) .",
    "the main message from this figure is that @xmath39 receives in the endpoint region , say between @xmath43 , a contribution of only 17% in the case of the bms model , whereas it reaches as much as 40% for the cz model and still 19% for the asymptotic solution .",
    "it was shown by khodjamirian @xcite that the light - cone qcd sum - rule ( lcsr ) method provides the possibility to treat the problem of the photon long - distance interaction ( i.e. , when a photon goes on mass shell ) in the @xmath44 form factor by performing all calculations for sufficiently large @xmath45 , using quark - hadron duality in the vector channel , and then analytically continuing the results to the limit @xmath46 .",
    "schmedding and yakovlev ( sy ) @xcite applied these lcsrs to the nlo of qcd perturbation theory .",
    "more recently , we have @xcite taken up this sort of data processing ( i ) accounting for a correct efremov ",
    "lepage ( erbl ) @xcite evolution of the pion da to every measured momentum scale , ( ii ) estimating more precisely the contribution of the ( next ) twist-4 term , and ( iii ) improving the error estimates in determining the @xmath47- and @xmath48-error contours in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "moreover , our error analysis takes into account the variation of the twist-4 contribution and treats the threshold effects in the running of @xmath50 more accurately .",
    "our procedure is based upon lcsrs for the transition form factor @xmath51 @xcite : @xmath52 following from a dispersion relation with @xmath53  gev@xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the @xmath56-meson mass and @xmath57  gev@xmath7 denotes the effective threshold in the @xmath56-meson channel .",
    "the spectral density @xmath58 @xmath59 $ ] is calculated by virtue of the factorization theorem for the form factor at euclidean photon virtualities @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xcite , and the factorization scale @xmath62 is fixed by sy at @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 contains a twist-4 contribution , which is proportional to the coupling @xmath65 , defined by @xcite @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    this contribution for the asymptotic twist-4 das of the pion as well as explicit expressions for the spectral density @xmath69 in lo",
    "have been obtained in @xcite to which we refer for details .",
    "the spectral density of the twist-2 part in nlo has been calculated in @xcite  see eqs .",
    "( 18 ) and ( 19 ) there .",
    "all needed expressions for the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : srggpi ] ) are collected in the appendix e of @xcite , cf .",
    "( e.1)(e.3 ) .",
    "we set @xmath70 in @xmath64 and use the complete 2-loop expression for the form factor , absorbing the logarithms into the coupling constant and the pion da evolution at the nlo level @xcite so that @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( rg denotes the renormalization group )",
    ". then , we use the spectral density , derived in @xcite at , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : srggpi ] ) to obtain and fit the cleo data over the probed momentum range , denoted by . in our recent analysis @xcite",
    "the evolution @xmath73 was performed _ for every individual point _ @xmath74 , with the aim to return to the normalization scale @xmath75 and to extract the da parameters @xmath76 at this reference scale for the sake of comparison with the previous sy results @xcite . in effect , for every measurement , @xmath77 , its own factorization and renormalization scheme was used so that the nlo radiative corrections were taken into account in a complete way .",
    "the accuracy of this procedure is still limited because of the uncertainties entailed by the twist-4 scale parameter @xcite , @xmath78 , with the factor @xmath25 expressing the deviation of the twist-4 das from their asymptotic shapes ( another source of uncertainty originates from the unknown nnlo @xmath79-corrections , see @xcite ) . based on our experience with the twist-2 case ,",
    "we set @xmath80 . as a result ,",
    "the final ( rather conservative ) accuracy estimate for the twist-4 scale parameter can be expressed in terms of @xcite . to produce the complete @xmath48- and @xmath47-contours , corresponding to these uncertainties , we need to unite a number of regions , resulting from the processing of the cleo data at different values of the scale parameter @xmath81 within this admissible range @xcite .",
    "the obtained results for the asymptotic da ( ) , the bms model ( ) @xcite , the cz da ( ) , the sy best - fit point ( ) @xcite , a recent transverse lattice result ( ) ( fourth reference in @xcite ) , and two instanton - based models , viz . ,",
    "( ) @xcite and ( ) ( using in this latter case @xmath82  mev , @xmath83 , and @xmath84  gev ) @xcite , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipses](a ) varying the twist-4 scale parameter @xmath78 in the interval @xmath85~\\text{gev}^2 $ ] .",
    "the important points to observe from this figure are these : ( i ) the nonlocal qcd sum - rule constraints , encoded in the slanted shaded rectangle , are in rather good overall agreement with the cleo data at the @xmath47-level ; ( ii ) the cz model and the asymptotic da are ruled out at least at the @xmath5-level .",
    "these findings are not significantly changed , even if one allows an extreme twist-4 uncertainty of 30% , or if excluding the low - momentum - transfer data tail  say , up to @xmath86  gev@xmath87 @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the asymptotic da is outside the 3@xmath88-error ellipse , whereas in the second case it remains outside the 2@xmath88 region with the instanton - inspired models just at the 2@xmath88-ellipse boundary and the cz model always far outside .",
    "an independent source of experimental data to constraint the shape of the pion da is provided by the e791 fermilab experiment @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these data are affected by inherent uncertainties and their theoretical explanation by different groups @xcite is still controversial so that they can not be used to exclude some optional model . for our exposition here",
    "the important point is to show that our predictions for this process are not conflicting the e791 data using for all considered models the _ same _ calculational framework , notably the convolution approach of @xcite .",
    "the results of the calculation are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipses](b ) making evident that the e791 data are relatively in good agreement with our prediction  especially , in the middle @xmath28 region , where our das `` bunch '' has the largest uncertainties ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bunch]a ) .",
    "note , however , that all theoretical predictions shown in this figure are not corrected for the detector acceptance . for a more precise comparison",
    ", this distortion must be taken into account .",
    "both analyzed experimental data sets ( cleo @xcite and fermilab e791 @xcite ) converge to the conclusion that the pion da is not everywhere a convex function , like the asymptotic one , but has instead two maxima with the end points ( @xmath89 ) strongly suppressed  in contrast to the cz da .",
    "these two key dynamical features of the da are both controlled by the qcd vacuum inverse correlation length @xmath21 , whose value suggested by the cleo data analysis is @xmath90  gev@xmath7 in good compliance with the qcd sum - rule estimates and lattice computations .",
