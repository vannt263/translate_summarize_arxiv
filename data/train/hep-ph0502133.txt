    "at present , the cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite mechanism for flavour mixing and cp violation is in agreement with all available experimental data .",
    "this is a remarkable success , since it is achieved with a relatively small number of parameters .",
    "once the experimental values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are used to fix the angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the standard parametrization , one has to fit , with a single parameter @xmath15 , the experimental values of a large number of quantities , including @xmath16 , as well as the bound on @xmath3 .",
    "this impressive result is nicely represented in the usual unitarity triangle fits @xcite . in view of the remarkable success of the standard model ,",
    "it is plausible that the ckm mechanism gives the dominant contribution to mixing and cp violation at low energies , although there is still significant room for new physics ( np ) .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of how the data available at present already provide an irrefutable proof that the ckm matrix is `` non - trivially complex '' , thus implying that the charged weak - current interactions violate cp .",
    "obviously , in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) , the ckm matrix has to be complex , in order to account for the observed cp violation , both in the kaon and in the b sector .",
    "the above question only becomes non - trivial if one allows for the presence of np @xcite .",
    "we shall carefully analyse the present experimental indications in favour of a complex ckm matrix , correcting at the same time various misleading and in some cases  erroneous statements one finds in the literature .    to have an irrefutable proof that the ckm matrix is complex is of the utmost importance in order to investigate the origin of cp violation , as well as to analyse what classes of theories of cp violation are viable in view of the present experimental data provided by b - factories .",
    "for example , one of the crucial questions concerning the origin of cp violation is whether cp is violated explicitly in the lagrangian through the introduction of complex yukawa couplings or , on the contrary , cp is a good symmetry of the lagrangian , only spontaneously broken by the vacuum .",
    "there are two classes of theories with spontaneous cp violation :    1 .   those where the phases arising from the vacuum lead to a complex ckm matrix , in spite of having real yukawa couplings .",
    "in this class of theories , there are in general more than one source of cp violation , namely the usual km mechanism , together with some new sources of cp violation .",
    "models where all phases can be removed from the ckm matrix and thus cp violation arises exclusively from new physics .",
    "examples of class i ) are , for instance , two higgs doublet extensions of the sm with spontaneous cp violation , without natural flavour conservation ( nfc ) in the higgs sector @xcite , as well as models where cp is broken at a high energy scale @xcite through a phase in the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a complex singlet , which in turn generates a non - trivially complex ckm matrix through the mixing of isosinglet quarks with standard quarks . examples of class ii ) are the simplest supersymmetric extensions of the sm with spontaneous cp violation @xcite , as well as three higgs doublet models with spontaneous cp violation @xcite and nfc in the higgs sector .",
    "it is clear that if it can be proved that experimental data constrain the ckm matrix to be complex , even allowing for the presence of new physics , the only models of spontaneous cp violation that are viable belong to class i ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we specify what our assumptions about np are and we address the question of how to obtain evidence for a complex ckm matrix which would not be affected by the presence of this type of np . in section 3",
    "we discuss the possibility of obtaining an experimental proof that the ckm matrix is complex , from the measurement of four indepedent moduli of this matrix .",
    "we argue that the cleanest proof would be obtained if one would use only moduli from the first two rows of the ckm matrix . however , we point out that contrary to some statements in the literature , this proof can not be obtained in practice , since it would require totally unrealistic precision in the measurement of @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in section 4",
    "we analyse the impact of the measurement of @xmath2 and @xmath1 and introduce a convenient parametrization of np . in section 5",
    "we emphasize the importance of a measurement of @xmath7 either direct or through the combined measurement of @xmath19 , @xmath20",
    ". finally , we present our summary and conclusions in section 6 .",
    "our assumptions about np will be the following .",
    "we will assume that in weak processes where the sm contributes at tree level , np contributions are negligible , while np may be relevant to weak processes where the sm only contributes at the loop level .",
    "this is a rather mild assumption on np .",
    "in addition , for the moment we will also assume that the 3@xmath213 ckm matrix is unitary , but we will come back to this point later .",
    "an example of this framework is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this scenario implies that np could be competing with any sm loop and more likely in @xmath22@xmath23 , @xmath24@xmath25 , @xmath26@xmath27 and @xmath28@xmath29 mixing .",
    "therefore , the usual interpretation of @xmath30 in terms of @xmath31 gets invalidated . the same could also be the case for the direct cp - violating parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xcite and various semileptonic rare decays . to clarify which are the fundamental observables that will not be polluted by np contributions ,",
    "let us write the ckm matrix in a particular phase convention @xcite in terms of all the rephasing invariant quantities @xcite that can a priori be measured in the flavour sector : @xmath34where the cp - violating phases introduced in eq .",
    "( [ vckm1 ] ) are defined by : @xmath35note that @xmath36 obeys the relation @xmath37 , by definition . without imposing the constraints of unitarity , the four rephasing invariant phases , together with the nine moduli are all the independent physical quantities contained in @xmath38 . in the sm , where unitarity holds ,",
    "these quantities are related by a series of exact relations which provide a stringent test of the sm @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the moduli of the first two rows are extracted from weak processes at tree level in the sm . from top",
    "decays we have some direct information on @xmath39  useless in practice compared to its unitarity determination from @xmath12 and @xmath40  , and essentially no direct information on @xmath41 and @xmath42 from tree level decays .",
    "therefore , the extraction of the moduli of the third row is made with loop processes and consequently can be affected by the presence of np . from eq .",
    "( [ vckm1 ] ) it is evident that the phases @xmath43 and @xmath44 will only enter in loop amplitudes because they appear in transitions involving the top quark , and therefore the usual extraction of these phases could be also contaminated by np .",
    "@xmath45 is too small to be considered ( see references @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 is the only phase that can be measured without np contamination , since it enters in @xmath47 transitions not necessarily involving loop mediated processes",
    ".    in our framework , the most straightforward irrefutable proof of a complex ckm could come from the knowledge of the moduli of the first two rows of the ckm matrix and/or from a determination of @xmath46 in a weak tree level process . to use the information on @xmath48 and",
    "the moduli of the third row will require a much more involved analysis including the presence of np .",
    "but by the same token , this analysis will be extremely interesting in the not less important goal of discovering the presence of np . in our search for an irrefutable proof of complex ckm",
    ", we will also analyse in parallel its consequences for the detection of the presence of np @xcite , confirming the recent results by ligeti @xcite .",
    "within this class of models , in order to investigate whether the present experimental data already implies that ckm is complex , one has to check whether any of the unitarity triangles is constrained by data to be non-``flat '' , i.e. to have a non - vanishing area .",
    "if any one of the triangles does not collapse to a line , no other triangle will collapse , due to the remarkable property that all the unitarity triangles have the same area .",
    "this property simply follows from unitarity of the 3@xmath213 ckm matrix .",
    "the universal area of the unitarity triangles gives a measurement of the strength of cp violation mediated by a @xmath50-interaction and can be obtained from four independent moduli of @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that one can infer about cp violation from the knowledge of cp - conserving quantities should not come as a surprise @xcite .",
    "it just reflects the fact that the strength of cp violation is given by the imaginary part of a rephasing invariant quartet @xcite , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , which in turn can be expressed in terms of moduli , thanks to 3@xmath213 unitarity . restricting ourselves to the first two rows of @xmath38 , to avoid any contamination from np , a possible choice of independent moduli would be @xmath17 , @xmath40 , @xmath12 and @xmath18 .",
    "one can then use unitarity of the first two rows to evaluate @xmath53 , which is given , in terms of the input moduli , by @xmath54note that eq .",
    "( [ jsquare1 ] ) is exact , but the actual extraction of @xmath53 from the chosen input moduli , although possible in principle , it is not feasible in `` practice '' .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the present experimental values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , assuming gaussian probability density distributions around the central values .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] the probability density distribution of @xmath57 , generated using a toy monte carlo calculation @xcite.only @xmath58 of the generated points satisfy the trivial normalization constraints and , among those , only @xmath59 satisfy the condition that the unitarity triangles close @xmath60 .       in order to extract information on @xmath57 from the input moduli , it may be tempting to plot only the points that satisfy all unitarity constraints , i.e. normalization of columns and rows of @xmath38 , together with the constraint of having @xmath61 .",
    "we have plotted these points in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] , which naively lead to @xmath62 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that , contrary to what has been stated in the literature @xcite , one can not interpret the above result as providing evidence for a complex ckm matrix , using as input data only @xmath63 and @xmath18 .",
    "this can be trivially seen from the standard ckm parametrization @xcite , by noting that from the input moduli @xmath64 and @xmath12 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be obtained .",
    "in order to conclude that @xmath18 has necessarily a non - vanishing contribution proportional to @xmath67 ( the leading one sensitive to @xmath31 ) , one would need to know @xmath18 with a relative error of @xmath68 !",
    "it is interesting to point out that the leading contribution to @xmath18 comes from @xmath17 , therefore also @xmath17 would have to be known with the same level of precision , but not @xmath12 and @xmath40 . for completeness",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:03a ] the value of @xmath57 extracted from input moduli that are assumed to have the required unrealistic precision .",
    "it is clear that now , essentially all points have @xmath61 , and therefore the corresponding @xmath69 has full meaning .",
    "figure [ fig:03b ] shows the @xmath70 distribution obtained with the same inputs as in fig .",
    "[ fig:03a ] , except for the central value of @xmath18 ; in this case only @xmath71% of the points have @xmath61 .",
    "notice that both values , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are fully compatible with present measurements ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "these two figures clearly show the required precision in @xmath17 and @xmath18 to check 3@xmath213 unitarity and to have an irrefutable proof of a complex ckm .",
    "finally , it should be also emphasized that although the above analysis was made using the almost collapsed unitarity triangle corresponding to the first two rows of @xmath38 , the same conclusions can be obtained if we consider the `` standard triangle '' , corresponding to orthogonality of the first and third columns .",
    "one can evaluate any of the angles of the unitarity triangle in terms of the input moduli , obtaining for example : @xmath75 since we are using as input moduli @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , it has to be understood that in eq .",
    "( [ singamma0 ] ) one has : @xmath80 the resulting expression can be easily written in terms of the input moduli as : @xmath81 it is obvious that a `` legitimate '' extraction of @xmath46 from the input moduli would require an unrealistic precision in the determination of the chosen moduli .",
    "in particular , the difference @xmath82 would have to be known at the level of @xmath83 , thus requiring @xmath79 and @xmath76 to be measured with a @xmath84 relative error .",
    "this confirms our previous argument , based on the standard parametrization . of course , eq .",
    "( [ singamma0 ] ) can be used to determine @xmath85 if one uses as input moduli @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "however , @xmath89 has the disadvantage that its extraction from experimental data is affected by the possible presence of np .",
    "we will turn to this question in the next section .",
    "above , we have argued that , although possible in theory , it is not viable in practice to prove that @xmath38 is non - trivially complex , from the knowledge of four independent moduli belonging to the first two rows of @xmath38 . we emphasize that this would be the ideal proof , since the extraction from experiment of the moduli of the first two rows is essentially immune to the possible presence of np .",
    "the experimental measurement of the @xmath24@xmath25 oscillation frequency has reached an average accuracy of almost @xmath92 .",
    "the theoretical prediction of @xmath2 within the sm is given by : @xmath93 where we have followed the standard notation .",
    "equation ( [ del ] ) is an approximation valid up to order @xmath94 . from this expression",
    "we can extract @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , unitarity and the experimental values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 determine @xmath98 , thus allowing the extraction of @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] we plot the new @xmath70 distribution obtained with @xmath99 , thus determined together with @xmath100 , @xmath97 and @xmath96 . table [ table ] presents all the values used for the input parameters .",
    "there is a striking difference between fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] . as we have emphasized in the previous section , the majority of points obtained for @xmath70 , when one uses as input @xmath100 , @xmath97 , @xmath96 , @xmath101 , do not satisfy the unitarity condition that the @xmath102 triangle closes ( i.e. @xmath103 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when we use @xmath100 , @xmath97 , @xmath96 , @xmath99 to extract @xmath70 , the majority of the points satisfies the unitarity condition that @xmath104 and in fact the value of @xmath105 agrees with its experimental value @xmath106 ( of course , using exclusively moduli of @xmath38 one can not determine the sign of @xmath53 ) .",
    "this means that , within the sm , one can use information on @xmath107 and @xmath2 to conclude that the triangle can not collapse to a line , thus implying a complex ckm matrix .",
    "unfortunately , this is not an irrefutable proof that ckm is complex , since @xmath2 can receive significant contributions from np , as we have emphasized in section [ sec:02 ] . the same is true for the cp asymmetry @xmath108 in the @xmath109 decays .",

    "( [ ajp ] ) one has to assume that the potential np contamination to the penguin diagram contributing to the decay amplitude is negligible .",
