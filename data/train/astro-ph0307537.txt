    "the release of the point source catalogs for the 2 ms exposure of the chandra deep field - north by @xcite represents a milestone for astronomy . the large collecting area combined with high spatial resolution of chandra",
    "have , with this extremely long exposure time , achieved sufficient sensitivity to detect the population of distant normal galaxies .",
    "much previous work on the optical counterparts to the chandra detections in the region of the hdf , such as that of @xcite and @xcite , has focused on the optically faintest counterparts of x - ray sources in efforts to find very distant galaxies , heavily obscured distant agns , etc . in this paper",
    "we address the origin of the x - ray emission from the chandra sources with optical counterparts corresponding to `` faint '' field galaxies using material from the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cfgrs ) , described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cfgrs was carried out in the region of the hubble deep field - north ( hdf ) @xcite , which is included within the larger area of the cdf - n .",
    "our redshift survey there achieves very high completeness to a deep limiting magnitude .",
    "the survey sample was selected based on the four - color optical and infrared photometric catalogs of @xcite and covers the area within a diameter of 8 arcmin centered on the hdf .",
    "objects were observed spectroscopically using lris at the 10-m keck telescope @xcite irrespective of morphology to include all agns , qsos and other possible extragalactic objects that might appear stellar .",
    "our composite catalog for the region of the hdf contains @xmath5595 galaxies with @xmath6 and includes the published data from @xcite ( from the lick deep group ) and the work of the caltech and of the hawaii group published in @xcite and subsequently to 1999 , as well as five unpublished redshifts from c. steidel .",
    "our composite catalog contains redshifts for more than 93% of the sample to a limiting magnitude of @xmath7 in the hdf itself , and to @xmath8 in the flanking fields .    of the 503 chandra sources securely detected by @xcite , 149 are within the 8 arcmin diameter area covered by the cfgrs .",
    "we adopt a requirement that the x - ray and optical positions must match to within a tolerance of 1.5 arcsec based on the astrometric accuracy of the chandra and the @xcite catalogs .",
    "we then find that 67 of these x - ray point sources can be matched with galaxies with @xmath9 in this field .",
    "hence about 45% of the very deep x - ray detections reported by @xcite arise from galaxies at intermediate redshifts which appear from their optical spectra to be normal . in the present paper",
    "we compare the x - ray emission detected by chandra with the star formation rates inferred from the [ oii ] emission lines of these galaxies . as in earlier papers in this series , we adopt the cosmology h@xmath10 km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . over the redshift interval of most interest , a flat universe with @xmath14 and a hubble constant of h@xmath15 km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11gives galaxy luminosities very close to those used below .",
    "the mechanisms giving rise to the x - ray emission of local star forming galaxies , reviewed by @xcite , are a composite of emission from the ism , from stellar sources ( predominantly x - ray binaries ) , from supernova remnants , and possibly from a nuclear agn . with the aid of chandra s high spatial resolution , separation of these components in nearby galaxies",
    "becomes feasible , see e.g. @xcite for the antennae galaxy .",
    "in nearby galaxies with high current sfr , x - ray binaries provide about half of the flux in the full chandra band .",
    "the hot components of the ism , which contribute most of the remaining flux , can also be studied in detail with chandra .",
    "the superbubbles , whose evolution was followed by @xcite , can be resolved , and galactic winds can be detected and the metallicity of the gas within them determined , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in addition , the sensitivity of xmm permits detection of a complex array of lines and precision spectral fitting for x - ray bright nearby galaxies such as m82 @xcite . while @xcite have detected off - nuclear luminous x - ray sources in galaxies to @xmath16 in the hdf , none of this richness can be achieved at present for the distant galaxies in our sample .",
    "the variation of the x - ray emission from nuclear sources , particularly given the low spatial resolution of early x - ray images , can be explained by either the xrb or the agn hypothesis .",
    "( see , for example , * ? ? ? * for m982 . ) for m51 , however , the detection of optical emission lines characteristic of a central weak low luminosity agn by @xcite is definitive proof that weak agns may be present even in these heavily star forming galaxies ; they find such weak agn in a high fraction of local galaxies .",
    "but the nucleus of m51 contributes only 12% of its total full band chandra luminosity ; the bulk of its x - ray emission comes from the extended and stellar sources @xcite .",
    "we consider here only those galaxies in the region of the hdf whose optical spectra show signs of moderate to strong current star formation , i.e. galaxies with easily detected optical emission lines .",
    "these have been assigned galaxy spectral classes in the cfgrs catalog using the definition of @xcite of @xmath17 ( moderately strong emission lines with detectable absorption lines as well ) and @xmath18 ( very strong emission lines ) .",
    "two broad lined agns have been culled out of the sample of 595 galaxies ; both of these have very high x - ray luminosities from the chandra data . however , elimination of narrow - lined agn based solely on their optical spectra is difficult as , for the higher redshift galaxies considered here , none of the key diagnostic features fall within the wavelength coverage of the available optical spectra .",
    "furthermore , the light of any nuclear agn will be diluted in such distant galaxies by the large metric aperture used for ground based spectroscopic observations @xcite .    in the local universe",
    ", the mass of a nuclear agn ( i.e. a black hole ) depends primarily on the mass of the stellar bulge component of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the star forming galaxies in the hdf is , for a given star formation rate ( sfr ) , in the mean considerably higher than that for local star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at high redshift , there may be more gas to power the central source .",
    "hence we may expect the impact of contributions from agns to be more important in the hdf than in local samples .",
    "there is a well established relationship between the far - ir luminosity and the radio luminosity ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) among local star forming galaxies , whose origin was discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored this relation at moderate redshifts by comparing the far - ir ( from iso ) and radio emission of 20 galaxies from the cfgrs in the hdf with a local sample .",
    "he found that the correlation between far - ir and radio emission established in local star forming galaxies continues to apply out to @xmath19 .",
    "deviations of excess radio luminosity from such a well defined relationship presumably imply the presence of an agn .",
    "however , the far - ir data in the region of the hdf ( from iso , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are quite limited both in depth and in size of field and are insufficient for our purposes . until sirtf data are in hand",
    ", we can not use this approach to test for agns .    to shed light on the possible presence of agns in our hdf samples",
    ", we build upon the work of @xcite , who studied a small sample of galaxies in the hdf with both radio and chandra observations and with redshifts from the cfgrs .",
    "they too suggested that the local relations apply to their hdf sample .",
    "we therefore construct the set of objects which are included in each of the chandra point source catalog , the cfgrs ( for redshifts ) , and the vla database for the hdf of @xcite and @xcite . as one step towards eliminating agns , we omit all sources where the chandra spectral index is negative ( i.e. very hard sources ) . galaxies which are in close pairs of comparable luminosity in the cfgrs",
    "were included only if it was clear to which component the chandra detection should be assigned . if not , such galaxies were ignored .",
    "eleven galaxies meet these criteria .",
    "these galaxies are indicated in table  [ table_sfr ] , and some median properties of the sample are given in table  [ table_median ] .    both the x - ray and the radio emission arising from star forming galaxies are essentially free of reddening effects , and hence should be tightly coupled .",
    "figure  1 shows the resulting @xmath20(1.4ghz ) versus @xmath3 for the 11 sources in common .",
    "a @xmath21-correction for the radio has been used since all but one of the galaxies have measured radio spectral indices , but none was used in calculating the x - ray luminosity .",
    "power law seds , in the form of @xmath22 , have @xmath21-corrections for luminosities @xmath23 of @xmath24 . for a slope @xmath25 between 1 and 2 ,",
    "typical of these x - ray sources , the @xmath21-correction has a total range from 0.0 to 0.3 dex for @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "most of the points define a tight line , as expected , but two of them , f36422_1545 and f36517_1220 , lie significantly above it .",
    "luminous discrete non - nuclear x - ray sources , also known as ulx sources , found in local galaxies are reviewed by @xcite ; the most luminous of these reach @xmath28 w in m51 @xcite .",
    "these two hdf galaxies have luminosities far higher than any local ulx , and presumably contain luminous agns .",
    "the redshift of f36422_1545 is @xmath29 , so the region of h@xmath30 is too far to the red to be accessible .",
    "the more modest redshift of f36517_1220 ( @xmath31 ) permits an examination of the rest frame 5000  region , although h@xmath25 is inaccessible .",
    "this means that the conventional agn diagnostics used in optical spectroscopy of @xcite and @xcite are out of reach .",
    "judging by the more limited test of line strength ratios , avoiding the h@xmath25 region , introduced by @xcite , f36517_1220 is a normal star forming galaxy .",
    "reconciliation of these conflicting claims is possible with the conjecture of @xcite regarding the importance of aperture effects on the detection of agn at high redshift from optical spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig_xcounts ] shows the full - band chandra counts as a function of the galaxy redshift for the sample of star forming galaxies in the region of the hdf of this paper .",
    "a detailed description of the sample selection will be given in ",
    "[ section_hdf ] .",
    "we ascribe the sprinkling of galaxies along the bottom of this figure to x - ray emission associated with normal star formation .",
    "the two suspected agns isolated from figure  [ fig_agn ] are circled , and among the most discrepant galaxies in figure  [ fig_xcounts ] .",
    "there are two galaxies in our sample with full band chandra detections which exceed 1000 , while the two broad lined agn that were eliminated from the sample have full band chandra detections in excess of 2000 counts .",
    "if we assume that all galaxies with full band chandra counts in excess of 100 contain a agn , then there are two broad lined and 8 narrow lined agn in our sample , of which only the two broad lined galaxies were picked out from their optical spectra as agns .",
    "the fraction of the total chandra detected flux originating from accretion onto a massive black hole is @xmath193% .",
    "the much more numerous normal star forming galaxies contribute very little to the total x - ray luminosity density .",
    "there are , in addition , 5 to 6 additional galaxies in this sample of 38 which are clearly discrepant , with excess x - ray flux , though their optical spectra appear normal .",
    "only one of these 6 galaxies has a radio detection .",
    "these too presumably have weak agn nuclei .    to within the small number statistics of the present sample",
    ", we therefore assert that about 20% of the spectroscopically normal high luminosity star forming galaxies in the hdf have nuclear agns which contribute substantially to their total x - ray fluxes .",
    "@xcite gives the frequency of seyfert i and seyfert ii galaxies in the cfa redshift survey of the local universe , while @xcite have done so for agns reaching to much lower luminosities .",
    "both the agn luminosity and the very rough agn fraction derived above for our sample lie in between these local determinations .",
    "@xcite find that 15% of their sample of 66 star - forming galaxies with @xmath32 in the groth strip are probably narrow lined agns .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34radio ) , and @xmath34fir ) are to first order independent of internal reddening within the galaxy , and hence these correlations , including that shown in figure  [ fig_agn ] for a sample of galaxies in the region of the hdf , have quite small dispersions , both among local galaxies and in the hdf using the cfgrs database , ignoring the obvious occasional outliers , which we presume to be agn .",
    "the underlying variable driving these correlations is widely assumed to be the sfr .",
    "we first create a sample of local star forming / starburst galaxies for comparison with our sample of much more distant galaxies in the region of the hdf .",
    "their properties , and the references from which their x - ray luminosities and h@xmath25 fluxes were taken , are given in table  [ table_local ] .",
    "we have modified the published data to correspond @xmath35 km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11  and have removed the galactic extinction using the maps of @xcite when necessary .",
    "we correct the sfr for inclination effects ; the result is denoted sfr@xmath36 .",
    "we take axis ratios for our sample of local calibrators from the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite , or , if necessary , measure them from ned images .",
    "we apply a correction of the form @xmath37(mag ) = @xmath38 , and adopt @xmath39(h@xmath25 ) = 1.3 @xcite .",
    "this does not remove the reddening experienced by a face - on disk galaxy .",
    "we have also applied small corrections to total galaxy x - ray fluxes taken from the catalog of galaxy observations with the einstein satellite of @xcite , given over the regime 0.2  4.0 kev , to cover the chandra full bandpass .",
    "the observed fluxes in the optical emission lines for these local galaxies have in most cases been measured through apertures large enough to encompass the entire galaxy , except for the data taken from @xcite .",
    "substantial aperture corrections for this data set are required and were calculated using images from ned under the assumption that the spatial distribution of the flux in the emission line is the same as that of a nearby broad band continuum - dominated filter .",
    "the h@xmath25 fluxes from @xcite as published are corrected for the internal reddening of the galaxy , and this was backed out prior to use .",
    "our local sample of star forming galaxies was selected based on our ability to locate the required observational material in the literature .",
    "few surveys of large aperture observations of nearby galaxies in the optical emission lines are available .",
    "we began with the sample of @xcite , and tried to locate the requisite x - ray emission for the galaxies in their sample with substantial sfr .",
    "a special effort had to be made to find suitable local galaxies with high sfr ; such galaxies are rare in the local universe .",
    "the two local galaxies with the highest sfr are at distances @xmath40 of 56 and 78 mpc , while all the others have @xmath41 mpc , and 9 of the 14 have @xmath42 mpc . @xcite",
    "have analyzed a large sample of galaxies from the sdss and find that the percent of local galaxies with signs of a recent or ongoing starburst decreases rapidly as the luminosity increases , so our difficulty in finding luminous local galaxies with high sfr is not surprising .",
    "these local galaxies , with h@xmath25 used as the diagnostic for star formation , are indicated by large filled circles in figure  [ fig_local_inclincor ] ; for @xmath43 , they are indicated by stars .",
    "a least squares linear fit to the 14 points is shown by the thick line , and has the form log(@xmath44[sfr@xmath36(h@xmath25 ) ] , with @xmath45 about this fit of 0.31 dex . the scatter would be noticeably larger if the inclination corrections were not used .",
    "several smaller sources contribute to the remaining scatter in the relation between @xmath3 and sfr@xmath36(h@xmath25 ) .",
    "they include the small corrections applied to intercompare observations made with three different x - ray telescopes ( chandra , asca and einstein ) , ignoring the x - ray k - corrections and , most importantly , ignoring reddening differences from galaxy to galaxy within the local sample after being corrected to face - on .",
    "table  [ table_disp ] gives an estimate of the contribution of each of these terms to the observed @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , at the lowest @xmath3 for these nearby galaxies , the number of detected discrete non - nuclear x - ray sources , presumably various types of luminous x - ray binaries , which may contribute an amount equal to the extended emission , becomes fairly small , and poisson statistics may become important .    we are using the 3727    emission line of [ oii ] as our diagnostic of sfr for our sample of distant galaxies in the region of the hdf . however , among local galaxies there are fewer measurements of the observed integrated flux in the 3727    emission line of [ oii ] than there are for h@xmath25 .",
    "this is presumably because the [ oii ] emission line is less dominant in its spectral region than is h@xmath25 .",
    "also the adjacent continuum is chopped up by strong absorption features there , hence narrow band imaging is not feasible .",
    "the major surveys for the strength of the the 3727    emission line of [ oii ] among local galaxies are those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "substantial aperture corrections are required for the former , while for the latter , the [ oii ] observed line fluxes are given with respect to the observed h@xmath25 flux .",
    "we were able to locate suitable measurements for only five of the galaxies in the local sample , all from @xcite .",
    "the resulting deduced sfr@xmath36 values , using the calibration of @xcite , are shown in figure  [ fig_local_inclincor ] as open circles .",
    "thin horizontal lines connect the h@xmath25 and [ oii ] sfrs .",
    "this offset in sfr@xmath36 represents mainly the difference @xmath46 between @xmath47(h@xmath25 ) and @xmath47(3727 ) , where @xmath48 ) is the total absorption for the integrated light of each of the calibrating galaxies ( corrected to face - on ) .",
    "reddening curves for galaxies are quite controversial @xcite , but most of the disagreement lies within the rest - frame uv , which we do not use .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath49 of @xcite , so @xmath50 mag .",
    "the differential extinction appears small for three of the galaxies , and much larger for ngc  3034 and ngc  5194 .",
    "the dashed line is the fit to h@xmath25 translated by @xmath51 dex in log(sfr@xmath36 ) so as to fit through the values of these last two galaxies , which are among the more reddened of the local calibrators .",
    "note that @xmath52 mag corresponds to a total reddening for a face - on galaxy of @xmath53 = 0.8 mag .",
    "this is not unreasonable for star forming galaxies ; the references quoted in table  [ table_local ] often ascribe @xmath54 to 1.5 mag ( equivalent to @xmath55 to 0.6 mag ) to the individual galaxies or the sample of galaxies studied in each case ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are many more surveys of emission lines in local star forming galaxies using small apertures , which concentrate on the galactic nucleus , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we , however , rely on total line fluxes , and these observations in general cover too small a fraction of the galaxy as a whole to be useful here . @xcite",
    "have assembled small aperture emission line fluxes for a set of 31 nearby star forming galaxies , combined them with fir fluxes from iras , and intercompared the results of applying the various diagnostics . with respect to sfr(fir ) which measures the total sfr",
    ", they find , with no extinction or inclination corrections , sfr(fir ) = 3.4 sfr(h@xmath25 ) , with a large scatter ( equivalent to @xmath56 dex ) and sfr(fir ) = 6.0 sfr(3727 ) , with a dispersion equivalent to @xmath57 dex . because we are using inclination corrections , our dispersions",
    "should be and are somewhat smaller .",
    "we will compare these relations to those we use later .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , there are many diagnostics that can be used to infer star formation rates , ranging from continuum emission in the uv , the far - ir and the radio to recombination and forbidden emission line strengths .",
    "the systematic errors induced by dust in several of these relations were discussed by @xcite , while @xcite discusses some of the problems associated with dust extinction in the uv and the use of uv fluxes , commonly used for galaxies with @xmath58 , where the rest frame uv is redshifted into the optical band .    given the wavelength coverage of the optical spectra from the cfgrs and the range of redshift under consideration",
    ", the sfr for the distant galaxies in our sample in the region of the hdf can only be determined via the flux in the 3727    emission line of [ oii ] , which is one of the less robust of these diagnostics .",
    "the strength of emission in this line is affected not only by dust but also potentially by variation of o excitation and the o abundance among the galaxies .",
    "the latter has been explored for local galaxies by @xcite and at intermediate redshifts by @xcite .",
    "all of these diagnostics are affected , each weighting a slightly different mass range , by the value of the initial mass function .",
    "we measure the equivalent width in the 3727    doublet , which is not generally resolved in these spectra , in the observed frame , then transform that to the rest frame .",
    "sed parameters defined by the sed model of @xcite have been determined by @xcite for each of these galaxies from multi - color broad band photometry extending from u to k. these are used to interpolate within the set of observed broad band colors , yielding the continuum flux at rest frame 3727   .",
    "since the redshifts are known , the observed fluxes in the emission line are transformed into emitted luminosity in this emission line for each galaxy in the sample . we are forced to do this as the lris spectra are not fluxed ; multi - slit spectra can not in general be fluxed due to differential slit losses between objects observed depending on the accuracy of the slitmask alignment and of the astrometry used to design the slitmasks .",
    "the adopted method of calculating the rest frame equivalent width of an emission line assumes either that the line emission more or less follows the same spatial distribution as the background light of the galaxy , or that the 1 arcsec wide slit used for the spectroscopy includes most of the total light of the galaxy .",
    "the latter is a reasonable assumption at the upper end of this redshift range ; at @xmath59 , 1 arcsec corresponds to 7.3 kpc ; the full size of the galaxy is sampled in the direction of the length of the slit .",
    "the sfr is computed from the emitted flux in the [ oii ] line using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "no corrections for internal extinction within the galaxies are made .",
    "the galactic extinction in the direction of the hdf is very small and is ignored here .",
    "we do , however , correct for inclination of the galaxies , which does not remove the reddening experienced by a face - on disk galaxy .",
    "we measured rough axis ratios from the images of the flanking field galaxies obtained by the goods project @xcite , and used the original hdf images for those galaxies within the hdf itself .",
    "images taken in the f814w filter , the reddest used in both these hst surveys , were utilized when available . in a few cases , no hst image that was deep enough to indicate the shape of the outer isophotes of the galaxy",
    "could be located ; no inclination correction was applied in such cases .",
    "we apply a correction of the form @xmath37(mag ) = @xmath38 .",
    "we assume @xmath60 mag , extrapolated from the work of @xcite ; this may be an underestimate of @xmath39 , which is rarely determined at wavelengths bluer than b. the sfr thus determined is denoted sfr@xmath36(3727 ) .",
    "there are two galaxies in the hdf sample with @xmath61 for which the equivalent width of h@xmath25 is available from the cfgrs spectra .",
    "these , corrected for the inclusion of [ nii ] in the blend and for inclination effects as described above , yield sfr@xmath36(h@xmath25 ) in reasonable agreement with sfr@xmath36(3727 ) .",
    "these galaxies both are of low luminosity ; the volume of the cone of the cfgrs redshift survey at such low @xmath62 is small .",
    "one of these is the object with the lowest star formation in this hdf sample , f36332_1134 .",
    "the diagnostic ratio of @xcite indicates that light from hii regions dominates the optical emission lines .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is taken directly from @xcite ; the observed flux over the full chandra bandpass is transformed into an emitted flux .",
    "many of these sources are quite weak ( see figure  [ fig_xcounts ] and in some cases the x - ray spectral index could not be determined from the chandra data . in a few cases , @xcite tabulate only an upper limit to the total flux over the full chandra band , presumably because of non - detection of the weakest sources in the higher frequency part of the chandra bandpass .",
    "we therefore ignore any @xmath21-correction to the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the resulting parameters for each galaxy in the cfgrs matched to within 1.5 arcsec to a chandra point source and which shows evidence of strong current star formation from its optical spectrum are listed in table  [ table_sfr ] and displayed in figure  [ fig_hdf_inclincor ] .",

    "the effect of ignoring the x - ray k - correction is relatively small .",
    "the uncertainties in the 3727    equivalent width measurements , given in table  [ table_sfr ] , are in general small .",
    "the conversion to an emitted line flux may introduce errors at the 30% level @xcite . the effect on the sfr@xmath36 derived from the observed luminosity in the 3727    emission line of an increase in the internal extinction within a galaxy of @xmath65 mag",

    "this table offers a sobering reminder of why sfr@xmath36(h@xmath25 ) is a more robust indicator of sfr than is sfr@xmath36(3727 ) , but our options are limited .",
    "overall , aside from the suspected agn , the hdf galaxies display a relationship between @xmath3 and sfr@xmath36 in figure  [ fig_hdf_inclincor ] which is highly reminiscent of that of the local calibrators , with larger scatter .",
    "the only major outlier among the @xmath17 galaxies in the right panel is a galaxy without an inclination correction .",

    "it should also be noted that two of these @xmath18 galaxies with @xmath3 above that of the suspected agn and with similar sfr , f36348_1628 and f36246_1111 , are not detected in the vla radio surveys of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the comparable relations obtained for 31 local galaxies by @xcite have constants within 30% of those given above when either h@xmath25 or the 3727    emission line of [ oii ] is used as the sfr diagnostic .",
    "we have used the rest frame @xmath70 luminosity to infer the mass of each galaxy .",
    "we follow the procedure of @xcite , where the sed parameters for each of the hdf galaxies are determined to deduce their rest frame @xmath70 luminosity , a procedure identical in principle to that described in  [ section_hdf ] and used to determine the continuum flux at rest frame 3727   .",
    "these are the stellar masses ; gas is not included .",
    "masses have been deduced for each of the local calibrators using their integrated @xmath70 flux from 2mass @xcite .",
    "the median mass of the local sample is @xmath71 , comparable to that of the @xmath18 galaxies in the hdf , while that of the @xmath17 galaxies is @xmath72 times larger .",
    "as the range of galaxy masses is large , we compare the values of sfr@xmath73  for the hdf and for the local sample .",
    "these , plotted as a function of mass , are shown in figures  [ fig_hdfmass_sfr ] and [ fig_localmass_sfr ] respectively , while the medians and the second highest values are given in tables  [ table_median ] and table  [ table_extreme ] .",
    "recall that for the local sample we use sfr@xmath36(h@xmath25 ) while for the hdf sample we use sfr@xmath36(3727 ) .",
    "the parameter sfr@xmath73  spans a range of a factor of @xmath74 for the hdf sample , which we regard as an indication of the rather broad galaxy spectral types used here , the lack of any luminosity indicator in the optical spectra , and our inability to differentiate @xmath17 galaxies from @xmath18 galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath18 galaxy with the highest sfr@xmath36/10@xmath75   shown in figure  [ fig_hdfmass_sfr ] is the highest redshift galaxy in our hdf sample , with @xmath76 .",
    "its spectrum has been checked ; the [ oii ] line strength and its errors appear valid .",
    "this galaxy is not discrepant in the @xmath3  sfr relationship of figure  [ fig_hdf_inclincor ] .",
    "it appears to be a genuine case of a high redshift galaxy with a very high sfr for its mass .    with no correction for reddening , table  [ table_median ]",
    "shows that the median sfr@xmath73for the @xmath18 galaxies in the hdf is 2.6 times larger than that of the local galaxies , while that for the @xmath17 galaxies is larger by a factor of 1.9 .",
    "thus , irrespective of the exact value of the two correction factors discussed above , the total sfr for the hdf galaxies is considerably larger than that of local galaxies .",
    "we adopt the nominal correction factors given above , with the additional support provided by the rough agreement with the local sample of @xcite .",
    "the median total sfr is then 7 times larger in the hdf sample than that of the local galaxies . the median sfr per unit mass , sfr@xmath73 , a measure of the efficiency of sfr , for the hdf is @xmath77 times that for the local sample with no extinction corrections . applying the nominal extinction corrections suggests that the median sfr per unit mass is 5 times higher in the hdf .",
    "we reject the suggestion that these differences arise from sample selection , such that only galaxies with very high sfr can be detected at high redshift .",
    "sample selection in the form of incompleteness of the cfgrs is not believed to be a serious concern here .",
    "we see many galaxies in the hdf with lower sfr ( see figure  [ fig_bighdf_lumz ] ) than those in the chandra sample , at least for @xmath78 . in this context",
    ", we note that the cfgrs could have detected emission in the 3727    line at least 5 times smaller than that observed for f36527_1355 at @xmath76 .    in local galaxies",
    ", a simple @xcite power law accurately relates a galaxy s total sfr to its disk - averaged gas surface density .",
    "however , we do not know the gas density in these systems , and information on possible mergers is not available either , so we can not attempt to isolate the additional factors beyond total stellar mass that undoubtedly influence the sfr in a particular galaxy .    in spite of these concerns ,",
    "the similar form of the relationship between @xmath3 , sfr@xmath36 , @xmath20(radio ) and @xmath20(fir ) in hdf samples of varying sizes , once cleaned of agns and taking reddening into consideration ( for sfr only ) , presented here , by @xcite , and by @xcite suggest that the physical mechanism for star formation is similar among all the galaxies discussed here , and it is operating in more or less the same way , but galaxies of higher mass dominate the star formation in the hdf , while lower mass galaxies dominate the star formation locally , as was already pointed out by @xcite and others .",
    "we consider whether the present sfr in each galaxy in the hdf sample is consistent with its age as inferred from its redshift @xmath62 , or whether the time averaged sfr had to be even higher in the past to have formed the observed mass of stars .",
    "this provides a window into the behavior of sfr with @xmath62 @xcite in a redshift regime where observations are more difficult .",
    "figure  [ fig_sfr_time ] shows sfr@xmath36(3727 ) for the hdf sample as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "the solid line indicates the accumulated stellar mass of a galaxy after 6@xmath79 yr ( the age of a @xmath80 galaxy ) for a sfr constant with time .",
    "if a galaxy is located to the right of the line , there has been insufficient time to produce the observed stellar content of the galaxy assuming sfr constant with time .",
    "in such a case , the time averaged sfr must have been higher in the past ( i.e. presumably at @xmath62 between 1 and 2 , as the total age at @xmath81 is very small , @xmath821 gyr ) .",
    "the symbol size in this figure increases with redshift , so we check whether the galaxies with @xmath83 are systematically to the right of the line .",
    "the @xmath18 galaxies are distributed fairly close to this line , while the @xmath17 galaxies tend to be to the right of it .",
    "their median redshift is half that of the @xmath18 galaxies ( table  [ table_median ] ) , but the dashed line in the right panel of the figure indicates the mass expected for constant sfr and an age of 9 gyr ; the @xmath17 galaxies still tend to lie to the right of that .",
    "for the @xmath18 galaxies in the hdf , only one high redshift galaxy appears to be more than a factor of three from the line .",
    "this case , and the smaller offsets to the right of the line of the other @xmath80 galaxies , can easily be accommodated by the factors @xmath46 and @xmath47(h@xmath25 ) , both assumed to be unity here , as well as by a few missing inclination corrections .",
    "so there is no need for a substantially higher sfr at @xmath84 to produce the stars seen in galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "the current sfr at @xmath4 is consistent with the time averaged sfr for @xmath84 for the @xmath18 galaxies .",
    "it is possible , but not demonstrated here , that the absorption corrections @xmath85h@xmath86 can also produce consistency for the @xmath17 galaxies without requiring a higher time averaged sfr in the past .",
    "further tests of this once more data become available will be interesting .",
    "we now consider which star forming galaxies within the hdf show x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite presents rest frame equivalent widths for the 3727    emission line of [ oii ] in a sample of 256 galaxies from the cfgrs in the region of the hdf .",
    "figure  [ fig_bighdf_z ] shows these as a function of redshift , with the x - ray luminous objects of the present sample indicated by larger symbols .",
    "we see that the x - ray luminous objects are not in general those galaxies at a given @xmath62 with the largest equivalent widths , but are mixed through the entire range of equivalent width , with a concentration towards the lower values . however , the equivalent width is not a measure of the emitted luminosity in the line .",
    "when we plot instead the emitted luminosity in the [ oii ] emission line at 3727  (see figure  [ fig_bighdf_lumz ] ) versus redshift , the situation is somewhat clearer .",
    "the x - ray luminous galaxies are among the most luminous in the full hdf sample of the cfgrs in this emission line , i.e. they have among the highest sfr at each @xmath62 , but having a very high sfr does not guarantee that a galaxy will be detected in the chandra images .",
    "we can not at present isolate the additional factors beyond the mass of a galaxy that might influence its sfr at @xmath4 .",
    "however , figure  [ fig_xcounts ] offers some possible clues .",
    "we suggest that the small number of discrepant galaxies in this figure all have weak nuclear agns .",
    "we suggest that the normal star forming galaxies are those sprinkled along the bottom of this figure .",
    "these all have very low full - band chandra counts , almost all less than 20 full - band counts .",
    "this is right at the detection limit of even the 2 ms chandra image @xcite .",
    "the small variations in inclination angle and reddening mean that those galaxies with the maximum detected 3727    line flux at any given redshift ( i.e. the upper envelope of the distribution in figure  [ fig_bighdf_lumz ] ) can only suggest , but not define , the set of galaxies with the highest total sfr .",
    "the lack of chandra detection of galaxies apparently with slightly higher or comparable sfr to those detected becomes a matter of chance , the inclination or the reddening .",
    "the spatial position of the galaxy within the chandra field , in particular its distance from the center of the chandra field ( where detection limits are higher ) , may also play a role . with this hypothesis to explain why some star forming galaxies we would expect to have been detected by chandra are not , the @xmath87 relation among the star forming galaxies in the region of the hdf becomes indistinguishable from that of local galaxies , and @xmath88 .",
    "there have been many efforts to determine the sfr at high redshift .",
    "the evolution with redshift of the rest frame uv luminosity density was used by , among others , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to study the evolution of the sfr with @xmath62 , while @xcite used the evolution of the [ oii ] luminosity density for the same purpose .",
    "all agree on a strong increase in these sfr diagnostics between the local universe and @xmath80 . in the present analysis",
    "we see this manifested through the emission line strengths of individual galaxies ; the very high emitted luminosity in the 3727    line of [ oii ] and the inferred sfr found among the most extreme galaxies in the hdf sample ( see tables  [ table_sfr ] and [ table_median ] ) surpass anything seen in the local universe .",
    "the enhancement in sfr / unit galaxy mass is also substantial .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray , radio and optical data suggests ( figures  [ fig_agn ] and [ fig_xcounts ] ) , in agreement with evidence from other surveys , that @xmath120% of the x - ray sources contain weak agns , even though these galaxies ( ignoring the two broad lined agns that have been deleted from the hdf sample ) appear from optical spectra of their integrated light to be `` normal '' .",
    "aperture effects appear to limit our ability to detect agn from such spectra in high redshift samples as suggested by @xcite .",
    "these agn produce more than 90% of the detected chandra flux arising from objects in the redshift regime @xmath2 .    because we are using the 3727    emission line of [ oii ] as our diagnostic of sfr",
    ", reddening is a serious concern , and we found that the introduction of inclination corrections significantly reduced the scatter in the @xmath87 relation .",
    "this is the first detection to our knowledge of inclination effects in such distant galaxies .",
    "it is very likely that inclination effects also contribute to the distribution of seds among distant star forming galaxies .",
    "they probably cause a significant part of the spread observed in the sed parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90(sbb ) determined by @xcite for the set of @xmath17 and for the set @xmath18 galaxies in the region of the hdf .",
    "once the reddening corrections are incorporated and the agns eliminated , we suggest that the @xmath87 relation for these distant galaxies is essentially identical to that prevailing in local star forming galaxies .",
    "the @xmath3-radio relation , presented here and , for a smaller sample , by @xcite , and the @xmath91 relation of @xcite for the hdf all agree with those of local star forming galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the physical mechanisms responsible for x - ray emission in these distant galaxies are the same as those that act locally .",
    "high observed flux in the 3727    line of [ oii ] is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for detection by chandra .",
    "the issue of which particular galaxies are detected by chandra is resolved by realizing that the normal star forming galaxies in our sample lie essentially at or only slightly above the chandra detection limit .",
    "inclination , reddening , etc which affect the transformation from [ oii ] emission line flux to total sfr can lead to a particular galaxy being detected by chandra , whereas another with similar sfr@xmath36(3727 ) at the same redshift may not be detected .",
    "many optical surveys of distant galaxies are underway which plan to use 3727    emission as a diagnostic for sfr and for metallicity . in qualitative terms , if the problems of internal reddening and potential agn contribution can be handled , the emitted luminosity in the 3727    emission line does appear to be a reasonable indicator of the sfr among these distant galaxies , but this work illustrates the difficulties associated with this emission line , where reddening is such a serious concern .",
    "once larger samples of distant galaxies with high precision multi - wavelength data permitting the use of multiple diagnostics for their star formation rates become available , one might be able to explore the issue of the constancy of the initial mass function between the local and the distant universe .",
    "the comparison we have carried out of the expected stellar mass assuming constant sfr with the actual galaxy stellar mass at @xmath80 suggests that no further rise in time averaged sfr is necessary at earlier times . extending this to a larger sample with better data will be of considerable interest as it probes the time averaged sfr at a key epoch of the formation of galaxies .",
