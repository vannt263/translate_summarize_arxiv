    "the last months have witnessed a decisive advance in numerical relativity , with different groups being able to simulate , for the first time and by using different techniques , the merger of two black holes of comparable masses ( without or with initial spin )  @xcite . since such binary black holes systems ( of a total mass@xmath6 )",
    "are believed to be among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for the ground based detectors like ligo and virgo , this breakthrough raises the hope to have , for the first time , a reliable estimate of the complete waveform by joining together post - newtonian ( pn ) and numerical relativity results .",
    "we recall that pn techniques have provided us with high - order results for describing the motion  @xcite and radiation  @xcite of binary systems , and that further techniques have been proposed for _ resumming _ the pn results  @xcite , thereby allowing an analytical description of the gravitational waveform emitted during the transition between inspiral and plunge , and even during the subsequent merger and ringdown phases .",
    "we now face the important task of constructing accurate _",
    "complete waveforms _ by _ matching _ together the information contained in _ post - newtonian _ and _ numerical relativity _ results .",
    "we view the present work as a contribution towards this goal ( for a recent first cut at this problem see  @xcite ) .",
    "the work we present here belongs to a scientific lineage which started with the pioneering works of regge and wheeler  @xcite , zerilli  @xcite , davis , ruffini , press and price  @xcite and davis , ruffini and tiomno  @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite studied the gravitational wave emission due to the _ radial plunge _ ( from infinity ) of a particle onto a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this was thought of as a model for the head - on collision of two black holes in the extreme mass ratio limit .",
    "the gravitational wave energy spectrum  @xcite and waveform  @xcite were obtained .",
    "davis , ruffini and tiomno  @xcite pointed out that the first part of the waveform could be described in terms essentially of a flat space `` quadrupole formula '' for a test particle following a schwarzschild dynamics ( ruffini - wheeler approximation  @xcite ) , while the last part of the waveform was dominated by exponentially damped harmonic oscillations .",
    "these damped oscillations were interpreted by press  @xcite ( see also vishveshwara  @xcite ) as vibrational modes ( now called quasi - normal modes ) of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the perturbative formalism employed in these works has been later shown to be expressible in a gauge invariant manner  @xcite .",
    "the case of a particle plunging from infinity with _",
    "nonzero angular momentum _ has been discussed by detweiler and szedenits  @xcite and oohara and nakamura  @xcite by means of the curvature perturbation formalism of teukolsky  @xcite .",
    "the radial plunge problem has been recently extended to a plunge from a finite distance  @xcite , with particular emphasis on the effect of the choice of initial data .",
    "however , none of the above works has studied the _ transition _ from the quasi - circular adiabatic inspiral phase to the plunge phase in extreme - mass - ratio binary black hole systems .",
    "the reason is that the original regge - wheeler - zerilli test - particle approach seems to require the test particle to follow an exact _ geodesic _ of the schwarzschild background .",
    "here we shall bypass this stumbling block by appealing to some results of pn theory .",
    "in particular , the effective one body ( eob ) approach to the general relativistic two body dynamics , which has been recently proposed to study the transition from inspiral to plunge in the comparable - mass case  @xcite , describes the dynamics of a binary system in terms of two separate ingredients : ( i ) a hamiltonian @xmath7 describing the _ conservative _ part of the relative dynamics , and ( ii ) a non - hamiltonian supplementary force @xmath8 approximately describing the reaction to the loss of energy and angular momentum along quasi - circular orbits . following a prescription suggested in  @xcite the badly convergent  @xcite pn - taylor series giving the angular momentum flux is _ resummed _ by means of pad approximants .",
    "our general motivation for studying this problem is : ( i ) to gain information on black hole plunges in a regime ( @xmath9 ) that is not yet accessible to full numerical simulations , and ( ii ) to learn how to match analytical results to numerical ones in a situation where it is relatively easy to perform many , controllable high - accuracy numerical simulations .",
    "this paper will be mainly devoted to the discussion of our numerical framework ; see  @xcite for a thorough comparison between analytical and numerical results .",
    "in the eob approach the relative dynamics of a binary system of masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 is described by a hamiltonian @xmath7 and a radiation reaction force @xmath8 , where @xmath4 and @xmath10 . in the general comparable - mass case",
    "@xmath11 has the structure @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the symmetric mass ratio . in the test mass limit that we are considering , @xmath14",
    ", we can expand @xmath11 in powers of @xmath15 .",
    "after subtracting inessential constants we get a hamiltonian per unit ( @xmath16 ) mass @xmath17 of the form @xmath18 here we have introduced the dimensionless variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 entering the hamiltonian @xmath24 are metric coefficients entering the effective one body metric @xmath25 in the limit @xmath26 in which we shall use  ( [ schw : ham ] ) the effective metric functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 reduce to the well - known schwarzschild expressions @xmath27 . since the radiation generation process will be studied in terms of the regge - wheeler tortoise coordinate @xmath28 , it is useful to have the hamiltonian explicitly written in terms of @xmath29 and its conjugate momentum @xmath30 .",
    "this amounts to performing a canonical transformation @xmath31 .",
    "the invariance of the action , @xmath32 yields @xmath33 , so that the new hamiltonian function becomes @xmath34 hamilton s canonical equations in the equatorial plane ( @xmath35 ) yield @xmath36 \\ , \\\\ \\label{eq : angmom_diss } \\dot{p}_{\\varphi } & = &   \\hat{\\cal f}_{\\varphi } \\equiv   -\\frac{32}{5}\\nu \\omega^5 \\hat{r}^4 \\frac{\\hat{f}_{\\rm dis}(\\omega\\hat{r})}{1-\\sqrt{3}\\omega\\hat{r } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the r.h.s . of the last equation",
    "we have introduced the second ingredient of the eob approach : the radiation reaction force @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath38 is the `` factored flux function '' of  @xcite scaled to the newtonian ( quadrupole ) flux .",
    "reference  @xcite has shown that the sequence of near - diagonal pad approximants of @xmath38 exhibits , during the quasi - circular inspiral phase ( @xmath39 ) , a good convergence toward the exact result known numerically  @xcite in the @xmath40 limit . here",
    "we shall use the @xmath26 limit of the 2.5  pn accurate @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _ , equations  ( 3.28)-(3.36 ) of @xcite in the @xmath41 limit ) . following the suggestion of  @xcite",
    ", we expressed , in  ( [ eq : angmom_diss ] ) , @xmath42 as a function of the two variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 with the hope that this expression remains approximately valid during the plunge ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we shall give evidence below that this hope is fulfilled .",
    "note also that the flux used in constructing @xmath37 , in  ( [ eq : angmom_diss ] ) , refers to the momentum flux _ at infinity_. reference  @xcite has shown that the flux down the event horizon ( of the background schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath46 ) would correspond to a ( here negligible ) 4  pn effect .",
    "following section  iv(a ) of  @xcite and taking the @xmath26 limit in all terms except the crucial @xmath47 , we start the orbit at some given initial radius @xmath44 and initial phase @xmath48 with corresponding momenta : @xmath49 where we explicitly have ( with @xmath50 ) @xmath51 figure  [ label : fig_1 ] shows the trajectory determined by this kind of initial @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( for the sake of convenience we fix @xmath55 in the numerical calculations ) ; after @xmath56 orbits the trajectory crosses the last stable orbit ( lso ) at @xmath57 and then `` plunges '' ( in a quasi - circular way @xmath58 , see inset in the right panel ) into the black hole .",

    "we now complete the description of an extreme - mass - ratio binary system by computing the gravitational wave emission driven by the system during the inspiral and the plunge .",
    "let us recall that non - spherical linear metric perturbations around a schwarzschild black hole can be expanded in scalar , vector and tensor spherical harmonics that are called even - parity [ or odd - parity ] if they transform under parity as @xmath66 [ or @xmath67 and are decoupled because the black hole is non rotating .",

    "they read @xmath71 the well - known expressions of the potentials and the less well - known expressions of the sources for a general stress - energy tensor can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we recall that from @xmath68 and @xmath72 one can easily obtain , when considering the limit @xmath73 , the @xmath74 and @xmath75 gravitational - wave polarization amplitude , and the emitted power and angular momentum flux according to @xmath76 + c.c.\\bigg\\ } \\ .",

    "the sourcing stress - energy tensor is , to leading order , that of a test particle following the ( relative ) dynamics described above .",
    "we can then use the gauge - invariant multipoles of the stress - energy tensor of a point particle as explicitly given in appendix a of  @xcite .",
    "since the zerilli - moncrief and regge - wheeler equations are solved on a @xmath29 grid , it is natural to express the source in terms of @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the `` particle tortoise coordinate '' , by contrast to a general `` field coordinate '' @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , since the particle dynamics is written using canonical variables , it is also natural to express the source in terms of the particle coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath82 and their ( rescaled ) conjugate momenta @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this has the advantage [ over the use of the @xmath85 coordinate and @xmath86 ] of allowing one to push the evolution in time as much as one as one wants when @xmath87 , without introducing spurious boundary effects that may spoil the waveforms ( and in particular the late - time tail ) .",

    "the fine structure of this gravitational wave frequency plot will be further discussed in  @xcite .",

    "as said above these two forms would be mathematically equivalent for a real @xmath102-function , but will differ when using the gaussian approximation  ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",

    "this left panel also shows the difference between the gravitational wave frequencies @xmath289 ( solid line ) computed with the two different sources .",
    "the relative difference  @xmath290 on both makes us confident that the `` smeared '' @xmath102-function is a very good approximation to the actual @xmath102-function .",
    "[ let us also comment , in passing , that we did a convergence check ( for @xmath205 ) by comparing waveforms obtained by means of gaussians ( with @xmath288 and @xmath291 ) , finding a relative difference of the same order of magnitude  @xmath290 ] .",
    "finally , we performed a consistency check regarding the explicit time derivative appearing in the coefficient of @xmath79 in the odd - parity source @xmath293 from ( [ src : odd ] ) . when expanded by leibniz rule , this time derivative generates three terms .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath294 would be present along a geodesic motion .",
    "by contrast , the terms proportional to @xmath295 and @xmath296 are proportional to @xmath15 and therefore vanish in the geodesic motion limit .",
    "these last two terms generate a correction of order @xmath297 in the source .",
    "such terms are _ formally _ negligible in the extreme mass ratio limit that we consider here . in the right panel of figure",

    "as we briefly mentioned in the introduction , beyond solving for the first time , within a certain approximation , the problem of the plunge in the extreme mass ratio limit , the most important aim of this work was to build `` actual '' _ numerical _ waveforms to be then compared with _ analytical _ ones , within the eob framework and philosophy .",
    "we recall that the basic idea of the eob framework is to produce quasi - analytical waveforms by patching together a quadrupole - type waveform during the inspiral and plunge to a qnm - type waveform after merger . in",
    "@xcite we will use the numerical tools presented here to measure to what extent these eob - type waveforms can approximate actual waveforms of binary black hole merger in the extreme mass ratio limit .",
    "we give an example of this numerical - analytical comparison in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "this figure compares the phases of the gravitational waveforms obtained by two different methods , one numerical and the other semi - analytical . in the first method ,",
    "the phase has been computed by integrating in time the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency given by ( [ inst : wgw ] ) , with @xmath217 obtained by numerically solving the zerilli - moncrief equation .",
    "the second method computes an approximate waveform in the following way : before crossing the light ring one uses a ( pad - resummed ) 3pn - improved quadrupole - type formula to compute the waveform from the eob dynamics . after crossing the light ring ,",
    "the previous quadrupole - type signal , taken in the quasi - circular ( qc ) approximation , is _ matched _ to a superposition of the first five qnms of the black hole .",
    "then one computes the phase of this matched analytical waveform by integrating the corresponding instantaneous gravitational wave frequency .",
    "the agreement between the `` actual '' phase and the `` effective one body '' phase is impressively good : it turns out that the maximum difference between the two is less than @xmath301 of a cycle .",
