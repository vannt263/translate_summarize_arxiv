    "the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix is frequently used to place theoretical constraints on the parameters of a theory . on the one hand , if a @xmath1 scattering amplitude grows with energy , as is typically the case in non - renormalizable theories , then the condition @xmath2 will inevitably be violated at some energy scale .",
    "this energy scale then sets an upper limit on where new degrees - of - freedom must appear to unitarize the scattering amplitude . on the other hand , in renormalizable theories",
    "there are relations among the parameters of the theory that cancel this growth with energy  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless so - called `` unitarity bounds '' can still be placed on renormalizable , read _ unitary _ , theories . if the parameters of the theory that enter into the piece of the amplitude that does not grow with energy are too large , the amplitude will appear to be non - unitary .",
    "the more accurate statement is that perturbation theory is breaking down for this choice of parameters .",
    "most famously , a leading order ( lo ) analysis of this type yielded an upper bound on the mass of the higgs boson in the sm , @xmath3  tev  @xcite . this method has subsequently been improved and refined , see for instance  @xcite .    in this",
    "respect unitarity bounds are different from other types of theoretical constraints on the parameters of a theory , such as requiring the potential to be bounded from below or requiring the electroweak vacuum to be the deepest of the vacua in the theory .",
    "that is to say , generally speaking , it only makes sense to apply unitarity bounds to theories that are assumed to weakly coupled such that low order perturbation theory should be a good approximation of the full result .",
    "in contrast , it is generally sensible to require _",
    "e.g. _  the potential to be bounded from below in any type of theory , strongly or weakly coupled .",
    "the preceding discussion makes clear a problem with the typical approach to deriving unitary bounds ; typically one tries to test where the breakdown of perturbation theory occurs using only the lo perturbative calculation .",
    "a better approach would be to compute the bounds at multiple orders in perturbation theory , and see how well they agree .",
    "in this work we give an algorithm for approximately computing the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) unitarity bounds on the quartic couplings of a general renormalizable theory .",
    "this approximate nlo result only requires knowledge of the leading order matrix of partial wave amplitudes , and the one - loop scalar contribution to the beta function of each quartic coupling that is to be bounded .",
    "more information is required to compute the exact nlo unitarity bounds .",
    "however the approximation we present is known dominate the nlo contribution to the unitarity bounds in both the sm and the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with a ( softly broken ) @xmath4 symmetry  @xcite . while this of course does not guarantee the approximate nlo contribution",
    "will always be the dominant one , it is reassuring to know there are multiple well motivated theories where this is the case .",
    "our main result for the approximate nlo correction is @xmath5 with @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the approximate nlo correction to a lo eigenvalue , @xmath8 , of the matrix of partial wave amplitudes for high energy scalar scattering , @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is the lo eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue @xmath8 ; and @xmath11 is the scalar contribution to the one - loop beta function associated with a quartic coupling @xmath12 .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of perturbative unitarity . in doing so",
    "we hope to highlight a couple of points that are well known , but perhaps sometimes overlooked .",
    "starting with the obvious , the @xmath0-matrix is unitary , @xmath2 .",
    "this condition can be translated into a relation among the various partial wave amplitudes of a given theory , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is computed in a basis such that it is diagonal , _",
    "i.e. _  it is the eigenvalues of @xmath14 that satisfy the relation  .",
    "note also that an integral over the @xmath15-body phase space for each term in the sum in the rightmost term in   is left understood .",
    "this is nothing but the equation for an @xmath15-sphere of radius @xmath16 centered at @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath14 is fixed by the real part of @xmath14 and the @xmath19 partial wave amplitudes .",
    "focusing on the eigenvalues , @xmath20 , of the matrix @xmath14 we have @xmath21 ^ 2 + \\sum_{n > 2 } \\left(a_j^{2 \\to n}\\right)^2 , \\ ] ] with the @xmath22 solution corresponding to the case when the imaginary part of @xmath20 is less than ( greater than ) one - half . assuming an expansion in powers of scalar quartic couplings , the first few orders of eq .",
    "take the form @xmath23 where the superscript @xmath24 is the perturbative order and we have dropped the superscript @xmath1 . for the @xmath25 solution we instead have @xmath26 , @xmath27 . assuming a valid perturbative expansion , the @xmath25 solution corresponds to a scattering amplitude whose tree level imaginary part is @xmath28 . since this is not a frequently encountered scenario we will not consider this possibility further in this work , drop the subscript @xmath29 , and set an upper limit of @xmath30 in the process .",
    "perturbative unitarity bounds are inequalities derived from eq .  .",
    "from   it is clear that the conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 yield equivalent bounds when the imaginary part of @xmath20 is kept in its exact form .",
    "however this is not the case if @xmath33 is expanded to a finite order in perturbation theory , as in  .",
    "for example , to two - loop order , the corresponding bounds are always weaker than those from @xmath32 .",
    "explicitly , to leading order , @xmath34 whereas @xmath35 .",
    "starting at three - loops in @xmath36 , nnlo for @xmath37 , the relative strength of the two bounds is no longer fixed .",
    "once the approximate nlo contributions to the eigenvalues of the partial wave matrix are known , which are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : derv ] , unitarity bounds can be obtained by evaluating one or more of the following @xmath38 ^ 2 \\leq \\frac{1}{4}. \\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if perturbation theory is valid it is expected that the bounds obtained from the upper limit ( @xmath39 ) will be similar in all three cases since the lo eigenvalue is non - trivial and the nlo(+ ) piece should represent a small correction , but it is important to test , and confirm or deny , if this is actually the case .",
    "in contrast the bound obtained from the lower limit ( @xmath40 ) only becomes non - trivial at nlo , and can only be violated when perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "bound at nlo is equivalent to the perturbativity bound called @xmath41 ( not @xmath42 ) in  @xcite , leading to at least a superficial demonstration of the interplay between perturbativity and unitarity .",
    "this same perturbativity bound was also investigated in the sm in  @xcite . ]",
    "while it is expected that the parameter space of a given theory will be more constrained by the nlo unitarity bounds because of the additional @xmath40 handle , using this bound goes somewhat against the spirit of the introduction in that there is no similar higher - order term to compare with .",
    "in fact , the nlo+ expression shows how the apparent @xmath40 violation of unitarity is resolved at higher - orders in perturbation theory .",
    "( note that the nlo+ expression contains some nnlo terms , but of course is not the full nnlo expression . ) to bring things full circle , at nnlo similar apparent @xmath40 violations of unitarity can occur from the interference between the tree level and two - loop @xmath1 amplitudes and/or the tree level and one - loop @xmath43 amplitudes",
    ". however , there is no reason to expect the higher - order versions of the @xmath40 bound to be similar to the nlo version , as was the case for the @xmath39 bound , since there is little and/or no overlap between the potentially problematic terms .",

    "however since the imaginary parts of the nlo elements of @xmath84 come exclusively from the @xmath59 terms , see   and the surrounding discussion , we can use the fact that the theory is unitary to determine the @xmath59 contribution to the nlo eigenvalues , see  . combining the @xmath83 contribution and the @xmath59 contribution",

    "what about computing the leading order partial wave matrix and the one - loop ( scalar ) beta functions themselves ?",
    "the renormalization group equations in a general quantum field theory to two - loop order have been known for some time , and software exists to derive them in a specific model  @xcite . in the extreme energy limit @xmath89 , which is sufficient to consider",
    "if one is only interested in bounding dimensionless couplings , the method of ginzburg and ivanov can be used to simply the computation of @xmath9  @xcite .",

    "are not important , and @xmath9 will be block diagonal with blocks of definite representations under the gauge and global symmetries of the theory  @xcite . in gauge theories , scattering amplitudes involving longitudinally polarized vector bosons",
    "should be included when determining the bounds on the quartic couplings of the theory .",
    "their inclusion can be greatly simplified through the use of the goldstone boson equivalence theorem , see _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we have not said much about the choice of renormalization scheme or the finite pieces of the counterterms we are neglected .",
    "one thing to keep in mind is that in a mixed @xmath90/on - shell scheme , gauge independence can be spoiled unless tadpole diagrams are properly taken into account .",
    "this can be done by generalizing the sm results of fleischer and jegerlehner  @xcite to the theory under consideration .",
    "in fact this has been done in the 2hdm  @xcite and the sm effective field theory ( smeft )  @xcite .",
    "another thing to keep in mind in our approach to finding the nlo unitarity bounds is the quartic couplings entering into the partial - wave amplitudes are necessarily running couplings evaluated at an energy scale much larger than the other scales in the problem .",
    "a lo analysis is simpler in the sense that expressions could simply involve ordinary quartic couplings .",
    "one could always `` rg - improve '' the lo bounds by replacing the ordinary couplings with running couplings with no penalty .",
    "however , to do the opposite , replace running couplings in the nlo expressions with ordinary couplings , would be a further approximation .",

    "the implementation of this model , as well as the general 2hdm , is included in the example notebook associated with the @xmath88 package . to be clear ,",
    "this is not a phenomenologically viable model ; it predicts a massless pseudoscalar , among other undesirable features . we are using it as an example simply because its scalar sector has only two unique quartic couplings , and the @xmath91 symmetry preserves this relation along the rg - flow .",

    "figure  [ fig : u2c ] shows the bounds on @xmath94 and @xmath95 that result when the various unitarity conditions ,  , are applied .",
    "the parameter space shaded blue , orange , green , red , and purple is ruled out by unitarity bounds from eigenvalues whose lo terms are proportional to @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , respectively .",
