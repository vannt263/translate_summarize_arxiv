    "therefore the statement that _ the volume is dominated by the inflating domain during eternal inflation _ does not hold in all gauges .",
    "also , the ratio of the inflating to the thermalized volume does not necessarily characterize the presence or the absence of eternal inflation .",
    "we now consider volume - weighted observables in an eternally inflating spacetime .",

    "we conclude that volume - weighted observables such as @xmath118 generally furnish neither any information specific to eternal inflation nor any gauge - invariant information .",
    "the hallmark of eternal inflation is the unbounded increase in the total number of independent inflating regions .",
    "it is also often stated that the total proper 3-volume of the inflating domain grows without bound at late times in an eternally inflating spacetime ; this is certainly true for the 3-volume computed along hypersurfaces of equal proper time or of equal scale factor .",
    "one of the criticisms expressed in refs .",
    "@xcite was that the 3-volume is a gauge - dependent characteristic and thus can not be used as an indication of the presence or the absence of eternal inflation . in an earlier attempt to resolve this issue , it was proven in ref .",

    "equal - time probability distributions in such gauges can not be described by the fp equations  ( [ eq : fp c])-([eq : fp p ] ) where the kinetic coefficients depend only on the field @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the statement about the growing volume of the inflating domain _ is _ gauge - dependent .",
    "if one allows completely arbitrary time slicings , the total volume of the inflating domain during eternal inflation might either grow or decrease depending on the time slicing .",
    "i illustrate this dramatic dependence on the choice of gauge in appendix  [ sec : counterexamples - to - the ] where i present an explicitly constructed foliation of a de sitter spacetime by spacelike hypersurfaces whose proper 3-volume monotonically decreases to zero at late times .",
    "these hypersurfaces are artificially chosen to be almost null almost everywhere , which makes their 3-volume arbitrarily small despite the expansion of the background spacetime .",
    "since an inhomogeneous eternally inflating universe expands `` slower '' than a pure de sitter universe , the same family of hypersurfaces will also have a decreasing 3-volume in inhomogeneous inflating universes .",
    "it follows that the 3-volume of an _ arbitrary _ family of equal - time hypersurfaces can not be used as a criterion for the presence of eternal inflation .",
    "however , a weaker statement is sufficient : namely , eternal inflation is present if ( and only if ) there _ exists _ a choice of time slicing with an unbounded growth of the 3-volume of inflating domains . in the remainder of this section we shall demonstrate the equivalence of this criterion and the usual definition of eternal inflation ( the existence of inflating domains at arbitrary late times ) .",
    "note that the existence of something `` at an arbitrarily late time '' is a gauge - independent notion due to the monotonicity of time parameters in all gauges .",
    "if the 3-volume of the inflating domain grows without bound in some time gauge , then obviously there exist inflating domains at arbitrarily late times .",
    "it remains to prove that if inflating domains exist arbitrarily late , then the inflating volume grows in _ some _ gauge .",
    "this growth can be most easily demonstrated in the @xmath63-folding gauge , @xmath64 , using the construction of `` eternal comoving points ''  @xcite .",

    "the langevin and the fokker - planck equations are equivalent descriptions of the same stochastic process , and we shall focus on the fp description .",
    "the distribution @xmath34 allows two interpretations . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath34 is the probability for the field to have a value @xmath7 at time @xmath31 along a single , randomly chosen comoving trajectory ; on the other hand , @xmath34 is the fraction of comoving volume where the field has the value @xmath7 , within an equal-@xmath31 hypersurface .",
    "( the `` comoving 3-volume '' of a subdomain @xmath77 of an equal-@xmath31 hypersurface is defined as the 3-volume of the subdomain @xmath169 of the hypersurface @xmath170 , where @xmath169 consists of points whose comoving worldlines pass through @xmath77 at time @xmath31 . )",
    "the equivalence of these interpretations can be seen from the following argument .",
    "consider a large but finite domain of volume @xmath171 within the hypersurface @xmath170 and a very dense grid of comoving trajectories starting out from this domain .",
    "the total number @xmath26 of these trajectories may be chosen as finite but very large , and the initial volume @xmath171 can be subdivided into @xmath26 tiny regions of comoving volume @xmath172 situated around each of the @xmath26 comoving lines . if the initial volume @xmath171 is sufficiently large so that all the statistically possible histories are sufficiently well sampled , then the number of lines that reach a value @xmath7 at a time @xmath31 is very close to @xmath173 .",
    "thus the comoving volume of the subdomain of the equal-@xmath31 hypersurface having the value @xmath7 is @xmath174 .",
    "therefore in the statistical limit @xmath175 and @xmath176 , the fraction of the comoving volume containing the field value @xmath7 at the time @xmath31 is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath34 is the statistical distribution of the comoving volume along an equal-@xmath31 hypersurface , then the comoving volume of the subdomain with the value @xmath7 will be @xmath174 .",
    "we denote this subdomain by @xmath177 and consider a comoving trajectory randomly chosen from the total comoving volume @xmath171 .",
    "the probability of this trajectory passing through the subdomain @xmath177 is equal to @xmath178 .",
    "therefore @xmath34 is the probability of the field having the value @xmath7 at time @xmath31 along a randomly chosen trajectory .",
    "we note that there do exist correlations between the values of @xmath7 at nearby comoving trajectories .",
    "however , these correlations are not reflected by the distribution @xmath34 since it specifies only the total volume , but not the location , of regions with the field value @xmath7 .",
    "if the initial comoving volume @xmath171 is sufficiently large ( many hubble volumes ) , the distribution of the field @xmath7 at time @xmath31 along a randomly chosen comoving trajectory will be @xmath34 despite the correlations between nearby trajectories .",
    "turning now to the distribution of the proper volume @xmath35 , we note that there is now only one interpretation , namely @xmath35 is the total proper 3-volume of the subdomain with the field value @xmath7 within an equal-@xmath31 hypersurface .",
    "( as before , we consider only the comoving future of a large but finite initial volume @xmath171 at time @xmath170 . )",
    "it appears to be impossible to interpret @xmath35 directly in terms of observations made on a single randomly chosen comoving trajectory .",
    "the distribution @xmath35 describes a branching diffusion process with a possibly unlimited growth , and its interpretation necessarily has to involve a potentially very large ensemble of trajectories .",
    "a connection can be formulated between the distribution @xmath35 and the joint comoving distribution of the field and the scale factor @xmath179 .",
    "the comoving distribution @xmath179 is interpreted as the fraction of the comoving volume where the field has the value @xmath7 and the scale factor has the value @xmath8 , within an equal-@xmath31 hypersurface .",
    "alternatively , @xmath179 is the probability of the field having the value @xmath7 and the scale factor having the value @xmath8 at time @xmath31 along a single , randomly chosen comoving trajectory .",
    "the distribution @xmath179 is the solution of the fp equation@xmath180 where @xmath181 is the differential operator entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp c ] ) and @xmath42 is the `` expansion rate '' function defined by@xmath182 for example , in the proper - time gauge @xmath183 while in the @xmath63-folding gauge @xmath184 .    to obtain the distribution @xmath35 , one can use the procedure of `` volume - weighting , ''",
    "@xmath185 which takes into account the expansion factor @xmath186 along the trajectory .",
    "it is easy to verify that the resulting ( unnormalized ) distribution @xmath35 satisfies the fp equation  ( [ eq : fp p ] ) .",
    "this establishes a link between the volume interpretation of the distribution @xmath35 and properties of a single comoving trajectory embodied by the joint probability @xmath179 .",
    "in this section i shall present two examples of foliations described by spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath187 such that the _ total _ proper 3-volume of each equal-@xmath31 hypersurface is finite and monotonically _ decreases _ with @xmath31 , asymptotically approaching zero at late times .",
    "the two examples will be foliations of the minkowski spacetime and of the future part of a de sitter spacetime , the latter obviously interpreted as a homogeneous , eternally inflating universe .",
    "these examples unequivocally demonstrate that an unbounded growth of the 3-volume of equal - time hypersurfaces during eternal inflation is not observed in all gauges .",
    "i shall first describe the idea behind the construction of the foliations and later give technical details . for simplicity ,",
    "let us begin by considering a flat 1 + 1-dimensional spacetime with standard coordinates @xmath188 and a saw - shaped hypersurface@xmath189 where the inverse cosine function is by definition such that @xmath190 .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath191 is piecewise null and has kinks at points @xmath192 , @xmath193 ( see fig .",
    "[ cap : s0 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the proper length ( i.e.  the `` 1-volume '' ) of this hypersurface is equal to zero .",
    "we can then choose a smooth spacelike hypersurface situated sufficiently close to @xmath191 , so that the proper length of the portion of that hypersurface corresponding to @xmath194 is smaller than a chosen bound @xmath195 .",
    "it is also possible to find another hypersurface for @xmath196 approaching the null surface @xmath197 even closer , so that the corresponding proper length is smaller than @xmath198 , and so on .",
    "thus there exists an _ unbounded _",
    "spacelike hypersurface @xmath199 with a _",
    "finite _ and arbitrarily small proper length @xmath200<\\varepsilon$ ] .",
    "the minkowski space can be foliated by copies of the surface @xmath191 shifted in the @xmath2 direction . instead of this `` null foliation ''",
    "we consider a family of spacelike hypersurfaces labeled by a time parameter @xmath31,@xmath201 where @xmath202 is some function",
    ". the family  ( [ eq : family mink ] ) will be an admissible foliation of the 1 + 1-dimensional minkowski spacetime as long as @xmath203 and each hypersurface is spacelike , @xmath204 these conditions can be satisfied by a suitable choice of the function @xmath202 , and moreover it is possible to have @xmath202 monotonically decrease to zero as @xmath91 .",
    "the resulting family of hypersurfaces is the desired foliation of the minkowski space with a finite and monotonically decreasing proper volume .",
    "this construction can be generalized to the 3 + 1-dimensional minkowski spacetime by considering a family of spherically symmetric hypersurfaces@xmath205 as will be demonstrated below , the function @xmath202 can be chosen to achieve a finite proper volume @xmath206 of the entire equal-@xmath31 hypersurface and moreover to have @xmath207 as @xmath91 .",
    "a slightly modified but basically similar construction yields an analogous family of spacelike hypersurfaces foliating a de sitter spacetime . for simplicity",
    "we consider a 1 + 1-dimensional de sitter spacetime with flat spatial sections .",
    "then we can use conformal coordinates @xmath208 , so that the de sitter line element is conformally flat,@xmath209 all lines @xmath210 are null geodesics and thus the saw - shaped hypersurface @xmath211 is piecewise null .",
    "however , we can not use the hypersurface @xmath211 to foliate the spacetime as in the minkowski case because the boundary @xmath212 prevents us from shifting @xmath197 arbitrarily in @xmath213 .",
    "instead it is possible to continuously deform the `` saw '' and to decrease the size of its ridges while growing new ridges as time passes ( see fig .",
