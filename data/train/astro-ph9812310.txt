    "one of the main goals of observational cosmology in the coming years is the measurement of the cmbr and its fluctuations . before arriving to us ,",
    "the cmbr photons traverse the entire observable universe .",
    "it follows that if one can observe the effect of the interaction of these photons with matter they pass through , then one should be able to obtain crucial information about the distribution of matter in the universe . with this perspective",
    ", sunyaev and zeldovich studied the various scattering processes that take place between black body photons and electrons in galaxy clusters .",
    "these phenomena , which are referred to collectively as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , are now being studied in great detail , and indeed are being used to probe cosmological structure formation ( @xcite and reference therein ) .    in their paper of 1980",
    "sunyaev and zeldovich @xcite discussed the possibility of measuring the radial velocity of a cluster of galaxies from the enhancement of the cmbr temperature in the direction of the cluster .",
    "this effect is somewhat similar to the well known sunyaev zeldovich effect in which cmbr photons are compton scattered by the hot gas in the cluster , a process which gives rise to a distortion in the cmbr spectrum in the direction of the cluster . for this reason",
    "the effect due to the bulk motion of the cluster has become known as the kinematic s - z effect , and the original effect as the thermal s - z effect .",
    "the thermal effect leads to a variation in intensity of the radiation given by    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the comptonization factor ,",
    "@xmath2 the temperature of the electrons in the cluster , @xmath3 , @xmath4 the optical depth , and @xmath5 the temperature of the cmbr . for small values of @xmath6 the change in intensity is negative , whilst for large values it is positive .",
    "the kinematic effect gives rise to a change in intensity given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radial velocity in units of the speed of light .",
    "the sign of the fractional change in intensity does not change sign with frequency , and is positive if the peculiar radial motion is towards the observer .",
    "the effective temperature change in independent of frequency , and given by @xmath9    in the same paper the question of the polarization that can be produced when the motion of the cluster has a component transverse to the line of sight is also discussed , and the degree of polarization induced in integrated light from the cluster is claimed to be of the order @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transverse velocity of the cluster relative to the cmbr .",
    "in fact , as we show below , the effect is exactly ten times larger , and has a strong frequency dependence .",
    "( sunyaev and zeldovich also argued that there would be a contribution from higher order scattering given by @xmath12 , which could be of a comparable size for larger optical depths , but we shall not discuss this here as the latter effect is still more negligible than thought previously . )",
    "this polarization will be in a direction perpendicular to the plane formed by the line of sight and the velocity of the cluster .",
    "as sunyaev and zeldovich point out , potentially this polarizing effect of the kinematic s - z effect can yield a great deal of information about the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters , and indeed in theory represents one of the few ways of determining their vectorial velocity .",
    "peculiar velocities are thought to lie in the range 500 - 3000 km s@xmath13 .",
    "cluster optical depths are badly known but appear to be in the range 0.01 to 0.05 , yielding a frequency integrated degree polarization due to single scattering of the order @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "such small values of polarization could be still be difficult to detect .    however , the frequency dependence of this polarization is of crucial importance , firstly because this frequency dependence helps distinguish the signal from other polarizing mechanisms , and secondly because the polarization rapidly increases as a function of frequency .",
    "although sunyaev and zeldovich did point out that the polarization should have a frequency dependence , they calculated only the frequency integrated polarization .",
    "in this paper we look more closely at the dependence of the polarization on frequency and find that at values of @xmath16 the polarization will be orders of magnitude higher than the frequency integrated polarization .",
    "furthermore this mechanism has a characteristic frequency dependence which should enable one to distinguish it from other polarizing mechanisms .",
    "the origin of the polarization in the case of the kinematic s - z effect is the apparent anisotropy of the cmbr radiation seen by the cluster due to its motion relative to the cmbr frame .",
    "although the degree of anisotropy in frequency integrated light for low values of @xmath17 is not very large , the monochromatic intensity displays much greater anisotropy .",
    "figure [ [ anisotropy ] ] shows the variation of incident intensity as a function of the viewing direction , described by the polar angle , @xmath18 , with respect to the axis of symmetry of the radiation field ( defined by the cluster velocity ) , at different frequencies and for @xmath19 .",
    "now consider the case where the cluster is moving perpendicularly to the line of sight .",
    "photons incident from the forward direction and scattered towards the observer will be scattered through @xmath20 , and hence fully polarized perpendicular to the line of sight and velocity of the cluster .",
    "similarly photons from the backward direction will be polarized in the same direction .",
    "photons arriving perpendicular to this plane will be polarized in the opposite sense , and hence tend to cancel out the effect of the photons scattered from the forward and backward direction .",
    "however the intensity of the incident radiation varies with the angle of incidence , @xmath18 .",
    "it is in fact the quadrupole that produces the net polarization .",
    "we also find that the degree of polarization depends not only on the transverse velocity , but also weakly on the absolute velocity of the cluster with respect to the cmbr in a non - degenerate way . in principle",
    "this means that measurement of the degree of polarization at different frequencies provides a means of determining the vectorial velocity without reference either to the kinematic intensity sz effect , and independently of any knowledge of the optical depth . in practice , however , use of optical depth estimates from the thermal sz effect , and the radial component of the cluster velocity from the kinematic intensity sz effect would provide much greater precision on the vector velocity measurement .    as in the case of the sunyaev zeldovich paper , we shall throughout use the thomson scattering approximation , using relativistic corrections for doppler and aberration effects .",
    "of course , a complete treatment should consider a distribution of hot electrons , in which case the relativistic expression for electron scattering should be used .",
    "for the points we make in this paper the simplified treatment is justified . moreover , by formulating the problem in the cluster rest frame and including all relativistic transformations and directional effects , this treatment makes itself amenable to generalisation to the full relativistic case .",
    "the geometric situation is represented in figure [ [ geo ] ] .",
    "the cluster has velocity @xmath21 relative to the rest frame of the cmbr , @xmath22 .",
    "we shall assume throughout that the cmbr has a perfect isotropic black body spectrum .",
    "the cluster will see an anisotropic but axisymmetric intensity distribution .",
    "let @xmath23 be an observer at our position but at rest in the frame of the cluster , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 be the angle between the axis of symmetry and the line of sight .",
    "we will first compute the stokes parameters as seen by @xmath23 .",
    "( all the primed quantities correspond the the rest frame of the cmbr and the unprimed to the rest frame of the cluster ) .",
    "the intensity of the cmbr in @xmath26 has a planck distribution given by : @xmath27    consider an incident photon in direction @xmath28 ( with polar and azimuthal angle @xmath18 and @xmath29 in the cluster frame @xmath24 ) and frequency @xmath30 also in the cluster frame , where the @xmath31 axis is defined by the axis of symmetry ( defined by @xmath21 ) .",
    "the frequency of this photon in @xmath26 will be given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "due to relativistic abberation , the apparent direction of the photon will be different in @xmath34 and @xmath26 , but it does not matter since the radiation field is isotropic in @xmath26 .",
    "writing the intensity in @xmath34 as @xmath35 and in @xmath36 as @xmath37 , and using the invariance property of the intensity , @xmath38 we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 . the frequency integrated intensity in the cluster frame in a direction @xmath41",
    "is given by @xmath42    the incident and scattered photons will have the same frequency in the cluster frame .",
    "the scattering angle is given by @xmath43 , and the unit vector perpendicular to the scattering plane by @xmath44 .",
    "the right handed orthonormal basis is completed by @xmath45 .",
    "the polarization is best described by the stokes parameters @xmath46 which represent the total intensity , the difference in intensity measured by polarimeter in two given perpendicular directions , the same difference but with the polarimeter rotated through @xmath47 , and the circular polarization respectively @xcite .",
    "the incident beam will be unpolarized .",
    "since thomson scattering produces no circular polarization , @xmath48 can be ignored .",
    "we take an observer basis @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is equal to the direction @xmath51 of the scattered photon , and @xmath52 is perpendicular to the plane defined by @xmath21 and the line of sight ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this defines the orientation of the polarimeter . to calculate the contribution of all incident photons we have to rotate from the scattering plane to the observer frame , and integrate over all solid angles , @xmath53 , and along the line of sight .",
    "we denote the angle of this rotation by @xmath54 ( see figure [ [ geo ] ] ) . using the phase function for thomson scattering , and introducing for convenience the abbreviations @xmath55 ( resp .",
    "@xmath56 ) to denote the sine ( resp .",
    "cosine ) of the variable @xmath6 , we may write @xmath57 in order to obtain the frequency integrated stokes parameters , @xmath58 should be replaced by @xmath59 in equations ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the optical thickness , @xmath4 , is given by an integral along the line of sight @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the electron density and @xmath62 the thomson cross - section .",
    "noting that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and integrating over @xmath29 , equations ( [ eq1 ] ) reduce to @xmath66 the total intensity seen by @xmath67 is then given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the direct light , @xmath70 is the light scattered toward the observer and @xmath71 is the light scattered out of the line of sight .",
    "the degree of polarization , @xmath72 , of the net light seen by @xmath67 is then given by @xmath73    all the above quantities are expressed for the observer @xmath67 .",
    "for an observer @xmath74 at rest in the cmbr frame we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "the fraction change in intensity given by @xmath78 describe the kinematic sz effect and , of course , coincide with the result of sunyaev and zeldovich @xcite in the case of radial motion @xmath79 .",
    "we can now compute the frequency integrated degree of polarization by simply replacing @xmath80 by @xmath59 in equations ( [ eq2 ] ) . keeping only terms up to @xmath81 in the expansion of @xmath59 ( eq . [ temp ] ) and taking @xmath82 and",
    "we obtain    @xmath83    where we have introduced the transverse velocity @xmath11 .",
    "this results has the same velocity and optical depth dependence as the one obtained by sunyaev and zeldovich , but is ten time greater . since @xmath72 is lorentz invariant this old also in the cmbr frame .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see in the next section , the polarization has a strong frequency dependence . in the low frequency limit ,",
    "the degree of polarization is independent of the frequency and is given by    @xmath84    this results is similar to what was claimed by sunyaev and zeldovich for the frequency integrated effect .",
    "in this section we present the degree of polarization that should be observed for a typical galaxy cluster .",
    "all our results are given for @xmath85 but values for other optical depths can simply be scaled linearly .",
    "figure [ [ pol_nu ] ] displays the degree of polarization against frequency for various transverse cluster speeds .",
    "we can see that @xmath72 slightly depends on the inclination even for constant values of @xmath11 . as mentioned previously",
    ", the polarization reaches a constant value in the raleigh - jeans ( low frequency ) limits according to formula [ [ lim_low ] ] .",
    "the variation of @xmath72 with frequency is very strong . at @xmath86",
    "the polarization is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the lower limit . in the planck higher frequency band , the expected polarization for @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "are of @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively , although these need to be scaled according to the optical depth .",
    "such degrees of polarization are above the detection limits foreseen by coming experiments .",
    "figure [ [ pol_nu ] ] display the sensitivity of the individual polarimetric detector of the planck experiment .",
    "since there are between 8 and 34 polarimetric detectors per band and since a cluster could have an angular size sensibly larger than the instrument resolution , it should be possible to get the polarimetric signal by proper processing of the data .",
    "furthermore , new experiments could be designed especially for polarimetric measurement .",
    "figure [ [ pol_beta ] ] displays the degree of polarization against @xmath17 for different frequencies . for all frequencies , as for the integreted effect",
    ", the degree of polarization has a @xmath81 dependence .",
    "we can see that the polarization due to thomson scattering in the cluster is much larger that the expected primordial polarization for a wide range of parameter and should therefore be measurable .",
    "transverse velocities of galaxy clusters will produce polarized signal in the scattered cmbr",
    ". this polarization will be perpendicular to the cluster velocity and the light of sight .",
    "although in frequency integrated light the level of polarization might be difficult to detect with the techniques presently available , the polarization has a strong frequency dependence , increasing towards higher frequencies . for values of transverse velocity of 1000 km s@xmath13 , and an optical depth of 0.02 ,",
    "the degree of polarization at 857 ghz is around @xmath91 .",
    "since the polarization depends on the square of the transverse velocity , and linearly on the optical depth , certain clusters should show higher polarization .",
    "other sources of polarization , in particular dust and synchrotron radiation , will contaminate the signal .",
    "however filtering techniques that take into account the characteristic frequency dependence of this polarization should allow one to extract the signal due to the kinematic effect .",
    "measured polarization could then be used to infer transverse velocities of clusters .",
    "this question will be elaborated in future work .",
