    "in this contribution , we investigate the potential of the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method ( tonry & schneider @xcite ) to unambigously determine cluster membership of large samples of dwarf ellipticals ( des ) in nearby clusters .",
    "the sbf method exploits the fact that on a galaxy image each seeing disc contains a finite number of stars .",
    "this number is quadratically proportional to distance and thus its relative rms ( causing the sbf ) is inversely proportional to distance .",
    "+ in the context of the sbf method , the distance modulus of a galaxy is given by the difference between apparent and absolute fluctuation magnitude @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is measured directly , while @xmath4 is derived from a distance independent observable , mostly colour .",
    "+ tonry et al .",
    "@xcite have determined a well defined relation between @xmath5 and @xmath4 for nearby giant early type galaxies in the range @xmath6 : @xmath7 regarding dwarf galaxies , the sbf method has only been applied to small samples of nearby des ( e.g. jerjen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . with the arrival of wide field imagers on large telescopes ,",
    "the use of sbf to measure distances to large sets of des in nearby clusters will be possible .",
    "the simulations were performed by adding artificial galaxy images with implemented sbf signal onto a background field image obtained with vlt and fors1 in the i - filter .",
    "the exposure time was 3000 sec , the seeing 0.5@xmath8 , and the pixel scale 0.2@xmath8/pixel .",
    "the completeness limit for point sources was i @xmath9 mag .",
    "the colour range investigated was @xmath10 mag . @xmath11",
    "$ ] was derived from tonry et al.s @xcite equation ( 1 ) and for @xmath12 from worthey s @xcite stellar evolutionary models for old and intermediate age stellar populations .",
    "a distance modulus of 31.4 mag to fornax ( ferrarese et al @xcite ) was adopted .",
    "the magnitude - surface brightness relation was chosen to fit the relation observed for fornax des by hilker et al .",
    "an exponential intensity profile was adopted .    to measure the sbf , first an elliptical model of the galaxy light",
    "was subtracted from the image .",
    "the resulting image was divided by the square root of the model . on this image , contaminating point and extended sources were masked out .",
    "the contribution of contaminating sources below the detection limit was negligible .    of the cleaned image ,",
    "the power spectrum ( ps ) was calculated and azimuthally averaged .",
    "the result can be written in the form : @xmath13 @xmath14 is the ps of the seeing profile .",
    "@xmath15 is the amplitude of the sbf , given in adu .",
    "@xmath16 is the white noise component .",
    "1 shows an example image and power spectrum for a simulated galaxy .",
    "2 summarizes the results of the sbf measurements on the simulated des . for @xmath17 mag ,",
    "about 50% of the measured galaxies have sbf with s / n@xmath18 and @xmath19 smaller than 0.5 mag . as nearby clusters such as fornax or virgo",
    "are isolated from background galaxies by several magnitudes in distance modulus , the sbf method therefore allows for unambigous cluster membership determination even for low s / n sbf data .      to demonstrate that our simulations do not overestimate the s / n of the sbf measurement on real galaxies , we compared sbf measurements for centaurus cluster galaxies , obtained from vlt - fors1 images in the i - filter , with simulations tuned to reproduce the measured values for these galaxies .",
    "as one can see in fig .  3 ,",
    "the s / n of the simulations matches well the s / n of real galaxy measurements .",
    "it has been shown that for nearby clusters such as the fornax cluster , the sbf method can yield reliable membership determination for des down to very faint magnitudes .",
    "we find that our simulations do not overestimate the achievable s / n , but are in good agreement with real measurements .",
    "an ideal application of the sbf method would be a deep wide field survey of nearby clusters such as fornax or virgo .",
