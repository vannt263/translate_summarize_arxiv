    "in recent years , entanglement has been considered as a key resource of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "a cavity quantum electrodynamics(qed ) system is a useful tool to create the entanglement between atoms in cavities and establish quantum communications between different optical cavities .",
    "recently , the manipulation of quantum entanglement for the system of cavity qed has been extensively investigated@xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to the study of the evolution of the entanglement under the influence of the environment @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out by yu and eberly @xcite that the entanglement of an entangled two - qubit interacting with uncorrelated reservoirs may disappear within a finite time during the dynamics evolution .",
    "this phenomenon , called entanglement sudden death ( esd ) has been observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , the entanglement sudden birth(esb ) in cavity qed has been discussed by ynac , yu , and eberly @xcite .",
    "more recently , lopez _",
    "et al_. @xcite have studied the entanglement dynamics of a quantum system consisting of two cavities interacting with two independent reservoirs and shown that esd in a bipartite system independently coupled to reservoirs is related to the esb .",
    "it has been pointed out that the cavity coherent state can be used to control the esb and esd in cavity qed@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to control esb and esd of a quantum system consisting of two noninteracting atoms each locally interacting with its own vacuum field .",
    "the two atoms , which are initially prepared in entangled states , are driven by two classical fields additionally .",
    "it is shown that esb and esd phenomenon may appear in this system and the time of esb and esd can be controlled by classical driving fields .",
    "in addition , the amount of the entanglement of the two atoms or cavities can be significantly increased by applying classical fields .",
    "now , we consider a system consisting of a two - level atom inside a single mode cavity .",
    "the atom is driven by a classical field additionally .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be described by @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the frequency of the cavity , atom and classical field , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the excited and ground states of the atom . here ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity ; g and @xmath13 are the coupling constants of the interactions of the atom with the cavity and with the classical driving field , respectively .",
    "note that we have set @xmath14 throughout this paper .    in the rotating reference frame",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is transformed to the hamiltonian @xmath15 under a unitary transformation @xmath16 @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . using the method similar to that used in ref.@xcite , diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath20 , and neglecting the terms which do not conserve energies ( rotating wave approximation )",
    ", we can recast the hamiltonian @xmath15 as follows : @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 stands for hermitian conjugation .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath15 can be diagonalized by a final unitary transformation @xmath24 with @xmath25}$ ] .",
    "then , we can rewrite the hamiltonian of the system @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth noting that the unitary transformations @xmath29 and @xmath24 are both local unitary transformations .",
    "as we known the entanglement of a quantum system does not change under local unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "thus , the entanglement of the system considered here will not be changed by applying the local unitary transformations @xmath29 and @xmath24 .",
    "in this section , we investigate esd and esb of a quantum system consisting of two noninteracting atoms each locally interacting with its own vacuum field . each atom interacts with its own vacuum field where the interaction of the system is described by @xmath30 .",
    "we show how to control entanglement sudden death and birth of a quantum system formed by two two - level atoms and two cavities via classical driving fields .",
    "assume the two - level atoms are prepared in entangled states and the cavities are prepared in vacuum states , i.e. , the whole system is initially prepared in the state @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 refer to atom 1 , atom 2 , cavity 1 , and cavity 2 , respectively . here , @xmath35 can be interpreted as the dressed states of the two - level atom .",
    "they are defined as follows : @xmath36    with @xmath37 , \\nonumber\\\\ f_2(t)&=&-ig\\cos^2{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}e^{-i\\delta_2t/2}\\sin{(\\omega t)}/\\omega,\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta_2&=&\\sqrt{(\\omega_0-\\omega_c)^2 + 4\\lambda^2}+\\omega_c-\\omega , \\nonumber\\\\ \\omega&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta_2 ^ 2}{4}+(g\\cos^2{\\frac{\\theta}{2}})^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] tracing over the degrees of the freedom of cavities , we obtain the reduced density matrix of two atoms @xmath38|-_{a_1}\\rangle|-_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle-_{a_1}|\\langle-_{a_2}|\\nonumber\\\\ & & + |\\beta f^2_1(t)|^2|+_{a_1}\\rangle|+_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle+_{a_1}|\\langle+_{a_2}|\\nonumber\\\\ & & + |\\beta f_1(t ) f_2(t)|^2(|+_{a_1}\\rangle|-_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle+_{a_1}|\\langle-_{a_2}|\\nonumber\\\\ & & + |-_{a_1}\\rangle|+_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle-_{a_1}|\\langle+_{a_2})\\nonumber\\\\ & & + [ \\alpha \\beta^ * f_1^{*2}(t)|-_{a_1}\\rangle|-_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle+_{a_1}|\\langle+_{a_2}|+h.c].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the reduced density matrix of two cavities is @xmath39|-_{a_1}\\rangle|-_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle-_{a_1}|\\langle-_{a_2}|\\nonumber\\\\ & & + |\\beta f^2_2(t)|^2|+_{a_1}\\rangle|+_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle+_{a_1}|\\langle+_{a_2}|\\nonumber\\\\ & & + |\\beta f_1(t ) f_2(t)|^2(|+_{a_1}\\rangle|-_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle+_{a_1}|\\langle-_{a_2}|\\nonumber\\\\ & & + |-_{a_1}\\rangle|+_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle-_{a_1}|\\langle+_{a_2})\\nonumber\\\\ & & + [ \\alpha \\beta^ * f_2^{*2}(t)|-_{a_1}\\rangle|-_{a_2}\\rangle\\langle+_{a_1}|\\langle+_{a_2}|+h.c].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to study the entanglement of above system described by density matrix @xmath40 , we adopt the measure concurrence which is defined as @xcite @xmath41 where the @xmath42(i=1,2,3,4 ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues in decreasing order of the magnitude of the  spin - flipped \" density matrix operator @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the pauli y matrix , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "particularly , for a density matrix of the form    @xmath46    the concurrence is @xmath47    combing the above equation with the reduced density matrix , we find that the concurrence of two atoms is @xmath48 and the concurrence of two cavities is @xmath49    in fig.1 , the evolution of two - qubit concurrence for different partitions @xmath50 ( solid line ) and @xmath51 ( dotted line ) are plotted with @xmath52 . for simplicity",
    ", we sometimes choose the special case of @xmath53 . on the one hand ,",
    "the concurrence of two atoms @xmath50 will disappear within a finite time during the dynamics evolution(esd ) . on the other hand , the concurrence of two cavities @xmath51 can appear during the dynamics evolution(see the dotted line in fig.1 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the time for which esd(@xmath54 ) and esb(@xmath55 ) occur could be adjusted by controlling the frequency @xmath3 and strength @xmath13 of classical driving fields .",
    "in addition , the amount of entanglement between two cavities can also be controlled by classical driving fields .    in order to show this more clearly",
    ", we plot the two - qubit concurrence for different partitions @xmath50 ( solid line ) and @xmath51 ( dotted line ) with @xmath56 in fig.2 . comparing fig.1 and fig.2",
    ", one can see time of esd(@xmath54 ) and esb(@xmath55 ) depend on the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the case of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , that is , esb appears after esd .",
    "however , when @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , that is , esb appears before esd .",
    "again , the time of esd and esb and the amount of entanglement between two cavities can be controlled by adjusting classical driving fields .",
    "we now turn to show the influence of classical driving fields on the distribution of entanglement in the present system .",
    "the bipartite entanglement of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are displayed in fig.3 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the concurrence @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are periodic functions of time t. the periods of them depend on the strength and the frequencies of classical driving fields . comparing the right panel and the left panel of fig.3",
    ", we find that the time of esb and esd and the amount of the entanglement of two qubits can be controlled by classical driving fields .",
    "for example , @xmath54 and the amount of @xmath51(dashed line ) of the right panel are larger than that of the left panel .",
    "in summary , we have considered a quantum system consisting of two noninteracting atoms each locally interacting with its own vacuum field .",
    "the two atoms , which are driven by two classical fields , are initially prepared in entangled states .",
    "we find that classical driving fields can increase the amount of entanglement of the two - atom system .",
    "it is worth noting that the time of esb and esd can be controlled by the classical driving fields .",
