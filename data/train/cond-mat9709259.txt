    "the low - lying collective excitations of magnetically trapped bose gases have been the object of very accurate experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "the first experiments @xcite were carried out at low temperature , with approximately all the atoms in the condensate state .",
    "these experiments showed almost undamped oscillations of the condensate at frequencies which have been found in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions based on the @xmath0 time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "in more recent experiments @xcite the study of the low - energy collective modes has been extended to higher temperatures where the condensate oscillates in the presence of a considerably large fraction of above - condensate atoms . in this case ,",
    "evidence is given of large frequency shifts with unexpected features and of strong damping rates which have not yet been understood theoretically .    on the theoretical side , extensions to finite temperature of the gross - pitaevskii equation have been put forward @xcite and have been very successful in explaining experimental results on the thermodynamic properties of these systems , such as condensate fraction , internal energy , specific heat and critical temperature @xcite .",
    "these mean - field descriptions , however , seem to be inadequate when applied to the study of collective excitations at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "first of all , the proposed mean - field approximations do not account for damping .",
    "secondly , the resonance frequencies are predicted to vary with temperature mainly because the number of atoms in the condensate changes , and the dependence of the frequency shift upon this quantity is expected to show the same behaviour as the corresponding @xmath0 dependence on the total number @xmath1 of atoms in the trap .",
    "none of the features exhibited by the experimental data on the frequency shift can be explained using these descriptions .    in the presently available finite-@xmath2 extensions of the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "it is assumed that the condensate oscillates in a bath of thermally excited atoms at rest and in thermal equilibrium in the effective mean - field potential generated by the average condensate density .",
    "this assumption is valid if the time scale on which the thermal cloud oscillates is much larger than the inverse frequency of the condensate oscillations . since",
    "both the condensate and the thermal cloud vary on comparable time scales of the order of the trap frequency , a full dynamic treatment of the coupled oscillations of the two clouds should be developed .",
    "the dynamic effects we are aiming to describe are irrelevant in the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of the system , for which the standard finite-@xmath2 mean - field approaches are well suited .",
    "in fact , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the fine details of the excitation energies do not affect the thermodynamic behaviour , for which what matters is the density of states at a given energy .",
    "another problem arises as to whether the appropriate regime to describe the experimental situation in @xcite is collisional or collisionless . in the collisional regime , which takes place at high temperatures and densities , the damping mechanisms are of dissipative type and the dynamic of the system",
    "is described by two - fluid hydrodynamics , recently developed for trapped gases in ref",
    ". @xcite . for very dilute systems at low temperatures",
    "the mean free path of the elementary excitations becomes comparable with the size of the system and collisions play a minor role .",
    "damping in this regime is not related to thermalization processes but to coupling between excitations , and can be described in the framework of mean field theories . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the collisionless regime may be appropriate for the jila experiments @xcite , but probably not for the mit experiments @xcite .    in the collisionless regime and at finite temperature",
    "the damping of the low - lying collective modes is dominated by landau damping .",
    "the idea that this mechanism might be relevant to explain the damping rates in trapped bose gases was first suggested by liu and schieve @xcite and has then been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite pitaevskii and stringari have derived , using perturbation theory , an expression for landau damping which is applicable to trapped bose gases , and have shown that , applied to the uniform case , it reproduces known results for both the low- and high - temperature asymptotic behaviour of the phonon damping .    in this paper",
    "we develop a time - dependent mean - field approach based on the popov approximation , which describes the dynamics of a bose - condensed gas in the collisionless regime .",
    "we obtain a set of coupled equations for the condensate and non - condensate components which allow us to calculate damping coefficients . in non - uniform gases",
    "we derive explicit expressions both for landau damping , which coincides with the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite , and for beliaev damping . in the uniform case",
    "we reproduce all known results on the damping rates of phonons both at @xmath0 and at finite @xmath2 .    however , the calculation of the temperature dependence of the frequency shifts using the popov approximation is not reliable . for a uniform system the calculation should give , in the long wavelength limit , the correction to the velocity of zeroth sound due to quantum and thermal fluctuations . on the other hand , at @xmath0 , the velocity of zeroth sound",
    "is directly related to the bulk compressibility of the system , for which we show that the popov approximation gives an incorrect result . by studying the isothermal compressibility",
    "we also find that the popov approximation is inconsistent at low temperatures , because it neglects fluctuations which are relevant for temperatures smaller than the chemical potential .",
    "since the same fluctuations are also important in the calculation of the velocity of zeroth sound in the low temperature regime , we draw the conclusion that a dynamic mean - field description , which gives correct account of both damping rates and frequency shifts , can only be developed going beyond the popov approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we develop the formalism of the time - dependent mean - field approximation . in section 3",
    "we study the damping of the oscillations in a non - uniform system obtaining explicit expressions for the landau and beliaev damping . in sections 4-a , 4-b we apply the results of section 3 to the uniform case . in section 4-c",
    "we investigate the isothermal compressibility of a uniform gas beyond the popov approximation .",

    "@xcite @xmath11 which allows us to describe situations where the system is displaced from equilibrium and the condensate is oscillating in time .",
    "the average @xmath12 in equation ( [ bgs ] ) is thus intended to be a non - equilibrium average , while time - independent equilibrium averages will be indicated in this paper with the symbol @xmath13 .",
    "the particle field operator can then be decomposed into a condensate and a non - condensate component @xmath14 and the non - condensate term satisfies , by definition , the condition @xmath15 . by applying the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) to the heisenberg equation ( [ heq ] )",
    "the term cubic in the field operators becomes ( all quantities depend on @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) @xmath18 we assume that for dilute systems the cubic product of the non - condensate operators ( last term in eq .",

    "the novelty here is that we will treat both terms within a time - dependent mean - field approximation holding in the collisionless regime which is the object of the present work @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the small - amplitude regime in which the condensate is only slightly displaced from its stationary value @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a small fluctuation . in the same way we consider small fluctuations of the normal and anomalous densities",

    "the ingredients that this theory should contain are the following : i ) the equilibrium anomalous density @xmath126 has to be taken into account , ii ) the renormalization ( [ gren ] ) of the interaction coupling constant is needed in order to reproduce the energetics at @xmath0 , iii ) the elementary excitation energies @xmath132 have to be gapless and must coincide with the bogoliubov spectrum at low - temperatures .",
