    "some of the most important discoveries in condensed matter physics are the integer and fractional quantum hall ( iqh and fqh ) states@xcite , which provided the first examples of electron fractionalization in more than one dimension and paved the way for our current understanding of topological order @xcite .",
    "conventionally realized in two - dimensional electron gases with a strong perpendicular magnetic field , these states exhibit a bulk energy gap and topologically protected chiral edge states .",
    "the topological order of the fqh states is characterized by topology - dependent ground state degeneracies@xcite and fractionalized quasi - particles @xcite , while the quantized hall conductance is determined by a topological invariant  the chern number  which for a band insulator ( iqh states ) can be determined by the momentum - space flux of the berry s phase gauge field.@xcite . since chern numbers are generic properties of a band structure , it is natural to expect that quantum hall states can also be realized in lattice systems without an applied magnetic field @xcite , and indeed such `` quantum anomalous hall '' ( qah ) states may be realizable experimentally @xcite . recently ,",
    "numerical evidence of fractional qah ( fqah ) states  equivalent to the @xmath1 laughlin state and non - abelian pfaffian state  has been found in interacting lattice models with ( quasi-)flat bands with chern number @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a flat band with @xmath2 is similar to a landau level , where the kinetic energy is quenched and interaction effects are maximized .",
    "recently , a systematic wave function approach was introduced that demonstrates how to associate each fqh state in a landau level to a counterpart in a generic @xmath2 band @xcite .    while known fqh states can be realized on the lattice ( see also @xcite ) ,",
    "a fundamental question is whether new states can emerge as well .",
    "here we show that the answer is yes .",
    "there are two key reasons that the fqah system is different : the possibility of a band with @xmath3 , and the interplay of topological order with lattice symmetries @xcite .",
    "while each landau level has @xmath2 , a single band in a lattice system can in principle carry arbitrarily high chern number .",
    "for example a model with @xmath4 quasi - flat bands has been recently proposed@xcite .",
    "here we show that there are new topologically ordered states  _ topological nematic states  in a partially filled band with @xmath3 .",
    "these states carry a nontrivial representation of the translation symmetry and spontaneously break lattice rotation symmetry @xcite . by using the wannier function representation @xcite , a band with chern number @xmath5",
    "can be mapped to @xmath5 layers of landau levels , but the @xmath5 layers are cyclically permuted under certain lattice translations .",
    "this leads to a dramatic interplay of these states with the lattice translation symmetry : a pair of lattice dislocations connecting different layers corresponds to a `` wormhole '' in the @xmath5-layer fqh system .",
    "the lattice dislocations effectively change the topology of the space , giving rise to topological degeneracies .",
    "surprisingly , the topological degeneracy associated with dislocations is nontrivial even when the state itself , in the absence of dislocations , is an abelian topological state @xcite .",

    "the formalism here can be generalized to a torus with finite @xmath20 , in which case the wilson line integral is replaced by a discrete summation @xcite .",
    "the wannier states form a complete basis of the occupied subspace , and each wannier state is localized in the @xmath17 direction and a plane - wave in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the essential property of the wannier state is that its center of mass position @xmath22 , which is also the eigenvalue of the projected position operator @xmath19 , is determined by the wilson loop @xmath23 consequently , the chern number @xcite of the band @xmath24 is equal to the winding number of @xmath25 when @xmath14 goes from @xmath26 to @xmath27 : @xmath28 in other words the wannier states satisfy the twisted boundary condition @xmath29 and correspondingly @xmath30 .",
    "due to such a twisted boundary condition , the wannier states for @xmath31 can be labeled by one parameter @xmath32 , and the wannier state basis @xmath33 is in one - to - one correspondence with the landau level wavefunctions in the landau gauge in the ordinary quantum hall problem @xcite . for @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 , so that the wannier states on even and odd sites are two distinct families , as shown in fig .",

    ", width=288 ]    let us first consider the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evenodd ] ( a ) , where we suppose that along an entire line parallel to the @xmath17-direction , the hoppings have been twisted .",
    "we also suppose that the number of sites in the @xmath17-direction is even .",
    "conceptually , we can imagine constructing this by taking a pair of dislocations , moving one of them around the @xmath17-direction of the torus , and re - annihilating them . as we explain below",
    ", this change in the geometry effectively changes the topology , as in the case with dislocations . to see this ,",
    "consider the @xmath66 states , which can be viewed as a direct product of two laughlin @xmath67 states .",
    "for a regular lattice with periodic boundary conditions , the low energy theory can be mapped onto two decoupled tori , each giving a degeneracy of @xmath217 , for a total topological ground state degeneracy of @xmath68 .",
    "however , the twisted hopping has the effect of gluing the two tori together into a single torus , and so we expect that the ground state degeneracy is actually @xmath217 .",
    "we can further see this in an alternative way by using the edge theory picture as presented earlier . by introducing twisted couplings into the edge theory",
    ", we introduce the tunneling terms @xmath218 with @xmath219 and @xmath220 defined in eq .",
    "( [ phitilde ] ) .",
    "naively , this would give @xmath221 different states labeled by the eigenstates of @xmath222 , similar to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : edge ] .",
    "however , we observe that there is a gauge symmetry associated with the independent fermion number conservation within each layer , which is associated with the shift symmetry @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 are independent . in the absence of tunneling between the different layers ,",
    "this fermion number conservation is clearly present .",
    "since the @xmath54 state is gapped , tunneling between the different layers is an irrelevant perturbation .",
    "therefore even in the presence of tunneling between the different layers , we may regard the fermion number conservation symmetry within each layer as an emergent symmetry of the topological state .",
    "we conclude that , of the @xmath226 degenerate minima of @xmath227 , the ones associated with the same eigenvalue of @xmath228 and different eigenvalues of @xmath229 are gauge equivalent to each other .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the topological degeneracy of such a twisted lattice is @xmath215 . in contrast , in the case of the non - twisted hoppings the gauge symmetry acts in a trivial way on all the states and therefore does not affect the topological degeneracy @xmath230 .    alternatively , consider a regular lattice , but with an odd number of sites along the @xmath17-direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evenodd ] ( b ) . in this case",
    ", there will be a line at some point in @xmath17 where wannier functions associated with different layers are adjacent .",
    "cutting the system along this vertical line , we obtain gapless edge states , and we observe that in gluing the system back together , we again have twisted hoppings along the entire vertical line . following the same argument as the last paragraph , in this case",
    "the ground state degeneracy is @xmath215 .",
    "this leads to a remarkable signature of the topological nematic states . for a regular lattice , when the number of sites in the @xmath17-direction is even , the topological degeneracy is @xmath231 .",
    "when it is odd , the topological degeneracy is @xmath215 .",
    "these topological degeneracies are independent of the length in the @xmath21-direction .",
    "such an even - odd effect can easily be used as a numerical diagnostic to test for such topological nematic states .",
    "if the strongly interacting hamiltonian that realizes the topological nematic states has a discrete lattice rotation symmetry , then the topological nematic states associated with the class ( 1,0 ) or ( 0,1 ) ( see section [ generaltft ] ) spontaneously break this discrete rotation symmetry .",
    "in such a situation , a physically realistic system can be expected to consist of domains involving different orientations . at the domain walls , it is possible that translation symmetry is preserved along the domain wall . as we show below",
    ", the translation symmetry along the domain wall can protect a single bosonic channel from being gapped out .",
    "( a ) illustration of the domain wall between two topological nematic states @xmath166 ( upper half ) and @xmath167 ( lower half ) .",
    "( b ) illustration that the left and right moving edge states along the domain wall transform differently in lattice translation @xmath56 .",
    "the right movers from the @xmath166 state are exchanged by @xmath56 while the left movers from the @xmath167 state are separately translation invariant.,width=288 ]    for concreteness , consider a domain wall between a @xmath167 and a @xmath166 topological nematic state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : domainwall ] . before coupling the two domains together",
    ", each one has two branches of chiral gapless edge states : @xmath232 and @xmath233 , for @xmath234 , where @xmath235 stand for the left / right - movers . naively , these counterpropagating modes will be gapped out by inter - edge tunneling",
    ". however , they have different properties under translation symmetry .",
    "in particular , under a translation along the domain wall , @xmath236 we see that for the translation symmetry along the domain wall to be preserved , the only allowed inter - edge tunneling terms must involve the symmetric combination @xmath237 . therefore ,",
    "either translation symmetry is preserved and the mode associated with the relative combination @xmath238 is gapless , or translation symmetry is spontaneously broken along the domain wall .",
    "this provides a novel example of translation symmetry protected gapless edge states .",
    "this realization that lattice dislocations carry non - trivial topological degeneracy raises a host of possible new directions .",
    "conceptually , we are now in need of a more general theory of topological degeneracy of dislocations and their possible braiding properties in general fqh states , both in bands with higher chern numbers and in non - abelian fqh states . for example",
    ", for a chern insulator with chern number @xmath239 , the same construction maps the lattice system to a @xmath0-layer fqh state .",
    "dislocations are `` branch cuts '' with degree @xmath0 in such a system , around which the @xmath0 layers are cyclically permuted .",
    "it would also be important to verify our predictions through numerical studies . the even - odd effect discussed in sec .",
    "( [ sec : evenodd ] ) is expected to generalize to a @xmath240 behavior in the topological degeneracy for @xmath239 .",
    "note that while the dislocations studied here have non - abelian properties , they are confined excitations of the system because the energy cost of separating dislocations grows logarithmically with their distance .",
    "nevertheless , physical materials can easily have many lattice dislocations , and if fqh states are realized in a material with higher chern bands , we expect that the lattice dislocations , in the limit of low dislocation density , can induce an extensive topologically stable entropy for temperatures @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the correlation length of the gapped fqh state , @xmath243 is the energy gap , and @xmath244 is the typical spacing between dislocations .",
    "a further interesting , exotic possibility is to imagine quantum melting the lattice to deconfine these dislocations .",
    "the resulting states , if realizable , are  topological liquid crystals \" and may correspond to the non - abelian orbifold states proposed in @xcite and that are described by @xmath245 cs theory.@xcite",
