    "ternary alkali metal ( a ) transition metal ( m ) acetylides with a general formula a@xmath0mc@xmath0 or amc@xmath0 have been the subject of research in inorganic and coordination chemistry for a few decades @xcite .",
    "ternary acetylides synthesized so far involve amc@xmath0 compounds with a @xmath1 \\{li , na , k , rb , cs } and m @xmath1 \\{cu , ag , au } and a@xmath0mc@xmath0 compounds with a @xmath1 \\{na , k , rb , cs } and m @xmath1 \\{pt , pd}. a major source of synthesis methods and characterization results on ternary acetylides is from the ruschewitz group@xcite .",
    "it was theoretically predicted in a recent publication by terdik , nmeth , harkay _ et al _",
    "@xcite that the photoemissive properties of cs@xmath0te , an old photoemissive material with very high quantum efficiency , could be improved by acetylation leading to a predicted cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 material .",
    "related compounds , such as na@xmath0tec@xmath0 , might have similarly advantageous photoemissive properties , such as high quantum - efficiency and reduced workfunction as calculated for the parent alkali tellurides .",
    "existing a@xmath0mc@xmath0 ternary acetylides are built of linear polymeric chains with -m - c@xmath2c- repeating units embedded in a matrix of alkali cations .",
    "the existence of such chains with -te - c@xmath2c- repeating units was proposed by the above - mentioned theoretical study , motivated by knowledge of a@xmath0mc@xmath0 compounds .",
    "analogous monomeric acetylenic tellurides / selenides / sulfides with the r - c@xmath2c-(te / se / s)-c@xmath2c - r@xmath3 structure have been known for decades@xcite .",
    "note , however , that in a@xmath0mc@xmath0 crystals the m atoms are formally neutral , and the -m - c@xmath2c- repeating units carry a charge of negative two that is charge - balanced by two adjacent alkali cations , as compared to the charge neutral r - c@xmath2c-(te / se / s)-c@xmath2c - r@xmath3 species where the formal oxidation state of the chalcogen is + 2 .",
    "alternatively , in the a@xmath0tec@xmath0 systems developed in this study , the -te - c@xmath2c- repeating unit must carry a -2 charge . while binary transition metal acetylides with the formula mc@xmath0 are well known explosives , their alkalinated versions amc@xmath0 and a@xmath0mc@xmath0 are not explosive , however , they are very air and moisture sensitive as they are strong reducing agents @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is because of their strong reducing nature that liauc@xmath0 and liagc@xmath0 , the only known li - containing ternary acetylides @xcite have even been proposed as anode materials for li - ion batteries @xcite . developing new syntheses of ternary acetylides with lighter and abundant transition metals or metalloids would allow for their practical consideration as anode materials in li / na - ion batteries .",
    "the goal of the present work was to develop an alternative synthesis to these intriguing materials , and determine the structure of a new class of tellurium containing ternary acetylides .",
    "li@xmath0c@xmath0 was synthesized by the reaction of li metal and acetylene gas in liquid ammonia ( lq - nh@xmath4 ) , followed by spontaneous disproportionation of lic@xmath0h to li@xmath0c@xmath0 and acetylene gas upon evaporation of the ammonia , and warming to ambient temperature , as described e.g. in ref . .",
    "in a n@xmath0 glovebox , tellurium powder ( 384 mg , 3 mmol ) as obtained from sigma - aldrich ( 99.8 % ) was mixed with li@xmath0c@xmath0 powder ( 120 mg , 3.17 mmol , 5.5 % excess ) in a flame - dried 100 ml schlenk flask with a teflon plug valve , then sealed and brought into a fume hood .",
    "nh@xmath4 gas from a tank was condensed at @xmath5 -60@xmath6c until it fully covered the solid reactants .",
    "the chilling of the flask was carried out in an acetone bath placed in a sonicator bay ( branson model 3510 ultrasonic cleaner ) through a coil attached to an electric laboratory chiller .",
    "sonication of the reactants was started when they were completely covered by lq - nh@xmath4 ( 5 - 10 ml ) .",
    "the sonication and condensation of nh@xmath4 ( at a slightly higher than atmospheric pressure ) continued until all the te powder was consumed by the reaction .",
    "the flask was occasionally swirled by hand and lifted out of the bath to confirm the disappearance of the te powder at the bottom of the flask . depending on the concentration of the reactants in the lq - nh@xmath4 , complete consumption of the te typically took 10 - 30 minutes .",
    "the color of the reaction mixture gradually changed from purple to violet and finally to yellow .",
    "when the te was fully consumed , the flask was gradually warmed to room temperature and the nh@xmath4 carefully evaporated .",
    "the flask was then sealed under a nh@xmath4 atmosphere and brought into the glove box for handling and storage .",
    "na@xmath0c@xmath0 was synthesized by the reaction of elemental sodium and acetylene gas in lq - nh@xmath4 followed by heating the resulting nac@xmath0h at 155 @xmath6c under vacuum as described in ref . .",
    "the reaction of te powder ( 384 mg , 3 mmol ) with na@xmath0c@xmath0 powder ( 220 mg , 3.14 mmol , 5 % excess ) in lq - nh@xmath4 was carried out analogously to that of the above described synthesis of li@xmath0tec@xmath0 .",
    "the resulting product is a yellow powder that also has to be handled in an inert atmosphere .",
    "nac@xmath0h was synthesized by the direct reaction of na ( 200 mg , 8.70 mmol ) with acetylene gas in lq - nh@xmath4 using a 100 ml schlenk flask as above .",
    "tellurium powder ( 520 mg , 4.06 mmol ) was added to the dry nac@xmath0h under protective flow of nh@xmath4 gas and lq - nh@xmath4 was condensed again on the reactants .",
    "the flask was occasionally manually swirled to allow for better mixing of the reactants .",
    "the te powder was consumed in about 10 minutes without sonication producing a yellowish solution with some yellowish precipitates .",
    "the nh@xmath4 solvent was carefully evaporated and a pale yellow powder obtained .",
    "the sealed schlenk flask was brought in the glove box and its contents were scraped into a mortar and ground whereby they became a yellow powder .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction confirms that the materials obtained by the two different syntheses of na@xmath0tec@xmath0 are identical .",
    "we have also attempted to synthesize the binary acetylide tec@xmath0 polymer by the polycondensation reaction of diiodoacetylene @xcite and lithium telluride @xcite in dry tetrahydrofuran , according to @xmath7 the reaction product was a metallic gray powder that was extremely sensitive to mechanical agitation after being washed with water and diethyl ether on filter paper .",
    "when dry , this material violently decomposed upon contact with a spatula .",
    "because of its explositivity that is similar to that observed in transition metal acetylides , this product could not be characterized .",
    "bis(phenylethynyl)telluride , ph - c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c - ph , was synthesized following the procedure of ref .",
    ", starting from phenylacetylene ( sigma aldrich ) .",
    "we have also attempted to synthesize its double lithiated form , in analogy to the a@xmath0tec@xmath0 ternary acetylides , reacting li - ph - acetylide ( ph - c@xmath2c@xmath8li@xmath9 ) with te powder in a 2:1 molar ratio in a sonicated dry thf solution .",
    "after about 24 hours of sonication all the te powder was consumed .",
    "evaporation of thf resulted in a yellow powder which turned out to be a 1:1 molar mixture of ph - c@xmath2c - te@xmath8li@xmath9 and unreacted ph - c@xmath2c@xmath8li@xmath9 , as characterized by extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) spectroscopy .",
    "this indicates that the hypothesized salt li@xmath0[ph - c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c - ph ] does not form , and the negatively charged -c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c- structural units are stable only in the a@xmath0tec@xmath0 ternary acetylides .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) spectra of the materials produced were obtained on a bruker d2 phaser benchtop xrd system using cu - k@xmath10 radiation at 1.5406  wavelength , at room temperature .",
    "an air - tight pmma specimen holder with a dome ( bruker a100b33 ) was used to hold the air - sensitive materials during the measurements .",
    "this sample holder adds a large background to the measured spectra between 15 and 25 ( @xmath6 ) 2@xmath11 values .",
    "note that xrd data for 2@xmath11 values smaller than those shown in figs .",
    "[ xrd - li2tec2 ] and [ xrd - na2tec2 ] are all due to the sample holder , including a sharper peak at about 13 and a broader one at about 10 ( @xmath6 ) 2@xmath11 .",
    "crystal structures were refined using the gsas software package.@xcite      extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) spectroscopy measurements were carried out on ph - c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c - ph and its double lithiated form at the te k@xmath12 edge using synchrotron radiation at the mrcat ( sector 10 ) beamline of the aps facility at argonne national laboratory .",
    "data was processed using the ifeffit - based programs athena and artemis.@xcite",
    "all previously known ternary acetylides of the a@xmath0mc@xmath0 type were synthesized by the solid state reaction of the corresponding bialkali acetylides and pt or pd sponges @xcite : @xmath13 as our initial attempts to follow the solid state reaction method failed for the direct reaction of tellurium powder with li@xmath0c@xmath0 , we had been looking for a suitable solvent to carry out the same reaction .    a recent article by the ruschewitz group pointed out that ( bi)alkali acetylides actually dissolve to some extent in liquid ammonia ( lq - nh@xmath4 ) @xcite . the same study also suggested that lq - nh@xmath4 might be a suitable reaction medium for the synthesis of ternary acetylides . motivated by this publication , we attempted the direct reaction of te powder with slight molar excess of li@xmath0c@xmath0 or na@xmath0c@xmath0 in lq - nh@xmath4 .",
    "the rather quick dissolution of the te powder during the reaction indicated the reaction of the dialkali acetylides with the te metal , as no dissolution occurs in the absence of the acetylides .",
    "when run in an ultrasonicator , the te was completely consumed in 10 - 30 minutes , depending on the concentration of the reactants .",
    "ultrasonication significantly shortens the time needed for completing the consumption of te powder by the bialkali acetylide , as compared to simple stirring ( 2 - 3 hours ) .",
    "we have used various temperatures from -80 to -35 @xmath6c and the reaction always completed very quickly when sonication was used .",
    "we have also tried using dry tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether as a reaction solvent but these proved far inferior to lq - nh@xmath4 and resulted only in some discoloration of the reactants even after hours of sonication .",
    "the synthesis starts with the condensation of ammonia onto a mix of the te and bialkali acetylide powder in a suitable , dry reaction vessel , such as a schlenk flask . in the initial phase of the condensation , when there is only a small amount of lq - nh@xmath4 present",
    ", purple / violet / red colors can be observed in the reaction mixture .",
    "these colors are typical indicators of polytelluride cluster anions that dissolve well in lq - nh@xmath4 , as known for a century @xcite .",
    "such polytelluride anions may consist of tens of te atoms in a single cluster carrying typically only a negative charge or two @xcite . in the case of our reactions ,",
    "the charge of these te clusters may only come from acetylide ions that attack the te powder from the solution and split it up into cluster anions with attached acetylide units that dissolve in lq - nh@xmath4 . as the dissolution of binary acetylides in lq - nh@xmath4 is very limited @xcite",
    ", one might expect a slow reaction .",
    "however , the small amount of dissolved acetylides is sufficient to solubilize all the tellurium powder and then it will be the dissolved polytelluride anions that attack the solid crystallites of bialkali acetylides to further split the polytelluride anions until all acetylide ions are attached to te atoms or clusters .",
    "thus , the solubility of polytelluride ions allows for an autocatalytic process and the reaction goes quickly even at low temperature , especially when sonication assists the mixing of the reactants and their attacks on each other .",
    "the final product is a colloid of yellow li@xmath0tec@xmath0 or na@xmath0tec@xmath0 crystallites in lq - nh@xmath4 , which must be stored air - free after the evaporation of nh@xmath4 and handled in a glove - box , as the products are very air and moisture sensitive , similar to their transition metal analogues .    the application of large ( around 50 % ) molar excess te instead of excess acetylide results in a cherry red solution of dissolved species .",
    "in this case the complete dissolution of the te powder may take a longer period of sonication and is believed to produce polytelluride ions with attached acetylide units .    while li@xmath0c@xmath0 is easy to produce due to the spontaneous disproportionation of lic@xmath0h at room temperature ,",
    "the production of heavier bialkali acetylides is increasingly cumbersome , especially for a @xmath1 \\{k , rb , cs } as it involves high temperature heating of monoalkali acetylides mixed with alkali metals in high vacuum @xcite . to avoid the direct use of bialkali acetylides we have developed an alternative synthesis based on monoalkali acetylides only .",
    "it consists of first reacting the te powder with two molar equivalent of monoalkali acetylides according to    @xmath14    that is followed by the disproportionation of the resulting mixture :    @xmath15    the first step of this reaction is familiar from analogous acetylenic organo - telluride reactions when the h of atec@xmath0h is replaced by an organic functional group , typically an arene @xcite .",
    "the second step may largely complete when the solvent nh@xmath4 is evaporated along with the acetylene gas , with the possibility that the rest of the acetylene gas is removed when the product is ground in a mortar .",
    "a repeated condensation of nh@xmath4 and sonication of the mixture , followed by repeated evaporation of nh@xmath4 helps to better mix the reaction components and remove as much residual acetylene gas as possible , before grinding the product in a mortar .",
    "we have not characterized atec@xmath0h , as the above two reactions are part of an equilibrium and the isolation of atec@xmath0h appeared difficult , if at all possible .",
    "the identity of the products for both na@xmath0tec@xmath0 syntheses are indicated by overlapping powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) spectra .",
    "the monoalkali acetylide based synthesis of ternary acetylides may be applicable to the synthesis of a wide variety of ternary acetylides avoiding the cumbersome production of heavier bialkali acetylides and the use of high - temperature solid state reactions .",
    "powder xrd spectra of li@xmath0tec@xmath0 and na@xmath0tec@xmath0 as well as the comparison of xrd patterns of na@xmath0tec@xmath0 made by the two different synthesis routes described above are shown in figures [ xrd - li2tec2 ] , [ xrd - na2tec2 ] and [ comparison - xrd - na2tec2 ] , respectively .",
    "the main geometric parameters of li@xmath0tec@xmath0 and na@xmath0tec@xmath0 , as obtained from rietveld fitting of xrd data , are listed in table [ crystalstructures ] .",
    "full details of the fitting are available as supplementary material @xcite .",
    "note that xrd data for 2@xmath11 values smaller than those shown in figs .",
    "[ xrd - li2tec2 ] and [ xrd - na2tec2 ] are all due to the sample holder , including a sharper peak at about 13 and a broader one at about 10 ( @xmath6 ) 2@xmath11",
    ". figures [ li2tec2-fitted ] and [ na2tec2-fitted ] display the fitted structures of li@xmath0tec@xmath0 and na@xmath0tec@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the space group of li@xmath0tec@xmath0 is p@xmath16m1 , identical with the space group of all known a@xmath0mc@xmath0 ( m = pt , pd ; a = na , k , rb , cs ) compounds .",
    "the space group of na@xmath0tec@xmath0 , however , is i4/mmm , representing a new structure in ternary acetylides .",
    "also note that the fitting of na@xmath0tec@xmath0 data identified two phases , a major one of the actual na@xmath0tec@xmath0 material with i4/mmm space group and a minor one of the unreacted excess na@xmath0c@xmath0 used in the synthesis .",
    "the c@xmath2c distance in li@xmath0tec@xmath0 is 1.044  , interpreted as a projection of a wobbling c@xmath2c dumbbell onto the c axis , therefore it is shorter than an acetylenic bond ( c@xmath2c distance is 1.203  in acetylene gas ) .",
    "the c@xmath2c distance in na@xmath0tec@xmath0 , as projected on the a and b axes , is 1.208  very close to that in acetylene . the wobbling motion of the c@xmath2c dumbbell and",
    "its effect on the projected c@xmath2c distance has also been observed in other ternary acetylides , such as k@xmath0pdc@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the short , 1.727  , te - c distance in li@xmath0tec@xmath0 should also be interpreted as a projected distance , while the long , 2.333  , te - c distance in na@xmath0tec@xmath0 is closer to expectations based on dft predictions @xcite .",
    "the te - c distance in bis[(4-methylphenyl ) ethynyl ] telluride is 2.045  @xcite , while it is expected to be about 2.4  in ternary acetylides with te on the basis of dft calculations , assuming the p@xmath16m1 space group @xcite .",
    "the surprisingly large a / c ratio in li@xmath0tec@xmath0 and the large li - te and li - c distances appear to correlate with the above mentioned wobbling motion of the c@xmath2c unit around the c - axis and may explain also the broad peaks in the xrd spectra .",
    "the broadness of the observed xrd spectral lines may partially also be attributed to crystal defects that may occur due to the low temperature of the synthesis where the crystal structure can not anneal well .    in the present phase of our research on ternary acetylides with tellurium , our only method of characterization was x - ray diffraction of the freshly made samples shortly after the synthesis , using an air - tight pmma sample holder .",
    "we have also attempted to obtain synchrotron xrd data of the same samples : unfortunately , the samples partially decomposed during the storing and handling , this was indicated by significant additional peaks in the synchrotron xrd spectra , as compared to the locally measured ones .",
    "neutron diffraction would also be very useful , especially for li@xmath0tec@xmath0 , for a more precise determination of the li and c positions , as te has a much greater x - ray scattering factor .",
    "the measurement of raman spectra would be helpful in the characterization of the c@xmath2c bond and c@xmath17 nmr to the types of carbon atoms present .",
    "the above types of additional characterizations could not be carried out in the present work primarily for reasons of great air - sensitivity of the product materials .",
    "they will be subject of forthcoming investigations .",
    "however , we are still confident that we have identified the title new compounds solely on the basis of the presented xrd data and through the control of the stoichiometries of the reactants . the xrd spectra of related compounds , such as a@xmath0o , aoh , a@xmath0te , a@xmath0te@xmath0 , te , a@xmath0c@xmath0 and ac@xmath0h ( a = li , na , with the exception of li@xmath0te@xmath0 that is not known @xcite ) are so clearly distinct from the observed xrd spectra , that none of them was found to be present in the syntheses products , except a small amount of the alkali acetylides used in excess as reactants .",
    "we have not taken elemental analysis of the products either , as the purity of the reagents was confirmed by xrd analysis and the solvent lq - nh@xmath4 is not expected to react with them at the low temperatures applied and is unlikely to form stable complexes with li@xmath9 or na@xmath9 at room temperature as ammonia complexes of alkali acetylides are known to exist only at the low temperatures of lq - nh@xmath4 @xcite and would decompose when warmed up to room temperature .",
    "therefore the total stoichiometry of the products should be the same as that of the reactants with the exception of the reaction using nac@xmath0h as reactant . in this latter case",
    ", however , the identity of the diffraction patterns shown in fig . [ comparison - xrd - na2tec2 ] indicates identical composition of the products of the two different syntheses referenced in the same figure , which makes the disproportionation of nac@xmath0h to na@xmath0c@xmath0 and h@xmath0c@xmath0 as described in eqs .",
    "[ disprop1 ] and [ disprop2 ] the only possible explanation of this reaction even without the explicit detection of h@xmath0c@xmath0 in the gases when the lq - nh@xmath4 solvent is evaporated .",
    "it is well known that zintl anions ( polyanions ) of heavier p - field elements , such as te , se , as , sb , bi , pb , etc , are highly soluble in lq - nh@xmath4 ( for reviews see e.g. refs . ) .",
    "such polyanions have also been observed with some transition metal elements , such as hg @xcite .",
    "this solubility of the zintl anions in lq - nh@xmath4 suggests that more ternary acetylides with metalloid and transition metal elements may be synthesized in lq - nh@xmath4 following analogous procedures to the ones described herein for te - containing ternary acetylides . in principle",
    ", these procedures may work also for transition metals if the transition metal starting material is provided in the form of sufficiently small polyatomic clusters , for example in the form of pyrophoric iron , nickel , manganese , etc .",
    "this may provide a practical route for the production and use of ternary acetylides , for example as anode materials in li - ion batteries .    in order to test whether the charged bis(ethynyl ) tellurides exist in a molecular form as well",
    ", we have synthesized ph - c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c - ph following ref . and its hypothetical double lithiated form , li@xmath0[ph - c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c - ph ] , by the direct reaction of ph - c@xmath2c@xmath8li@xmath9 with te powder in a 2:1 molar ratio in sonicated dry thf solution .",
    "figure [ exafscomp ] shows a comparison of the te k - edge exafs spectra of the two materials .",
    "the spectrum of ph - c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c - ph can be modeled up to @xmath18  by nominal structure which has two c@xmath2c groups surrounding the te absorber ( see supplementary material for details , ref . ) .",
    "however the spectrum of li@xmath0[ph - c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c - ph ] shows ca .",
    "0.8 c@xmath2c groups surrounding each te atom on average .",
    "this indicates that the product of the latter reaction is a less than 1:1 molar mixture of ph - c@xmath2c - te@xmath8li@xmath9 and unreacted ph - c@xmath2c@xmath8li@xmath9 , see figure [ exafscomp ] .",
    "this suggests that the negatively charged -c@xmath2c - te - c@xmath2c- bonding system exists only in the crystals of a@xmath0tec@xmath0 ternary acetylides and not in molecular forms .    while the ternary acetylides synthesized in the present work may display many interesting physical properties , such as those predicted in ref . by terdik , nmeth , harkay , et al .",
    ", the present work was intended to discuss solely the synthesis of these new materials .",
    "the examination of their electronic properties , such as charge distribution , workfunction , photoemissive quantum yield and battery electrode applications should be the subject of separate investigations .",
    "we believe that the synthesis methods described here are significantly new as they allow for a quick solvent - based synthesis of a@xmath0mc@xmath0 type ternary acetylides instead of the traditional high temperature solid state synthesis .",
    "the key enabler of the new synthesis methods is the solubility of acetylated polyanionic clusters of tellurium atoms ( or potentially that of other metalloid or metal elements ) in lq - nh@xmath4 , described in the present work for the first time in the literature .",
    "this development was also motivated by the recent observation of limited solubility of acetylide ions in lq - nh@xmath4 by the ruschewitz - group @xcite .",
    "we have described two efficient new synthesis methods for the production of ternary alkali metal tellurium acetylides , li@xmath0tec@xmath0 and na@xmath0tec@xmath0 .",
    "the new syntheses methods are based on the reaction of binary alkali acetylides with tellurium in lq - nh@xmath4 , or on the reaction of tellurium powder with two equivalent of monoalkali acetylides in lq - nh@xmath4 and letting the system disproportionate to the corresponding bialkali ternary acetylide and acetylene gas .",
    "this latter method avoids the cumbersome synthesis of heavier binary acetylides .",
    "the syntheses are significantly accelerated by ultrasonication .",
    "the colors of the reaction mixture point toward the existence of polyatomic tellurium anions with attached acetylene units dissolved in lq - nh@xmath4 in earlier phases of the reactions .",
    "the good solubility of these polyanions in lq - nh@xmath4 and the modest solubility of binary acetylides allow for fast reactions even at the low temperatures of the lq - nh@xmath4 medium , especially when sonication is used , too .",
    "the ternary acetylides produced are the first examples of ternary acetylides with metalloid elements , as opposed to the numerous examples of previously synthesized ternary acetylides with au , ag , cu , pd and pt .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that these new syntheses may be used analogously to produce ternary acetylides with other metalloid and transition metal elements as well , provided that soluble polyatomic anions can be produced in early phases of the reactions .",
