    "however , the great majority of grbs with detected photons above 100 mev are long bursts with typical durations above 2 seconds : they are possibly associated with stellar explosions of massive stars .",
    "much less is known about the high - energy proprieties of _ short _ grbs that show durations below 2 seconds .",
    "these short events are usually hard compared to the average properties of grbs and are believed to be associated with the coalescence of neutron - star binaries ( but see zhang et al .",

    "based on the properties of the @xmath10 mev and @xmath11 mev emissions of showing a clear dichotomy between the low- and high - energy gamma - ray emissions , we define two time intervals , interval i from @xmath9 to @xmath12 s and interval ii from @xmath12 s to @xmath13 s ( see figure [ fig-2 ] ) .",

    "we also notice a substantial soft - to - hard spectral evolution during interval i. if we define a hardness ratio as @xmath27 ( counts above 1 mev)/(counts below 1 mev ) , we obtain @xmath28 during the first peak ( between @xmath9 and @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 during the second phase of interval i ( between @xmath29 and @xmath12 ) .    a remarkable absence of gamma - ray events during interval i is evident .",

    "the interval ii fluence in the energy range 0.5 - 10 mev range is @xmath34 .    to search for emission above 30 mev , we selected grid gamma - ray events within 15 degrees of the burst position .",
    "for this analysis we used all the grid events with reliable direction and energy reconstructions , resulting in 15 events in the time interval from @xmath9 to @xmath32 s. the expected number of background events in this time interval is 1.4 , implying that the grb is detected above 30 mev with a @xmath35 statistical significance .",

    "the mcal + grid spectrum of interval ii is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ spec ] .",
    "even though a theoretical investigation is beyond the scope of this paper , we can briefly emphasize here a few relevant points .",
    "\\(1 ) the broad - band emission of  shows very distinct radiation phases during interval i and the following delayed emission phase .",
    "prompt gamma - rays above 30 mev are absent during interval i , but they constitute a crucial component during interval ii and the following tail . remarkably , this is the first case of a delayed rise of the gamma - ray emission above 25 mev detected in a short grb .",
    "a similar behaviour was shown by the long grb 080916c @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that the same process responsible for high energy gamma - ray production takes place , in both long and short grbs , independently from the central engine .",
    "\\(2 ) the prompt phase ( interval i ) spectrum is peaked at @xmath48  mev . comparing with other short grbs ( see ghirlanda et al .",
    "2009 ) we find that the @xmath49 for grb 090510 is the highest peak energy ever recorded for a short grb ( about 2.4-@xmath26 greater than the mean value for short grbs ) .",
    "also the rest - frame peak energy ( @xmath50 @xmath51  mev ) for is greater than the @xmath52 for the other short grbs with known redshift .",
    "the large value of @xmath52 , combined with a quite usual value of the isotropic ( comoving ) energetics ( @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 erg in the whole energy range ) and peak luminosity ( @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 erg / s ) implies that grb 090510 does not follow neither the @xmath59 amati relation ( amati et al 2002 ) nor the @xmath60 yonetoku relation ( yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first short grb that does not follow the yonetoku relation . +",
    "no significant emission is detected above 10 mev , implying a rather strong constraint on any possible power - law emission above @xmath61 ( @xmath62 at the 90% confidence level ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the prompt phase shows a significant soft to hard spectral evolution . as it can be inferred from fig .  1 and from the mcal hardness ratio calculations , the last peaks of interval i are harder than the first peak .",
    "\\(5 ) the total isotropic energy of interval ii and tail is larger than that of interval i : by summing the mcal and grid contributions to the emission , we obtain for the delayed phase @xmath64 @xmath55 erg .",
    "\\(6 ) the temporal index @xmath40 is substantially different from that ( @xmath65 ) subsequently measured by",
    "_ swift_-xrt between 80 and 1400 sec after trigger @xcite .",
    "this last phase can be attributed to an afterglow with spectral and temporal characteristics in agreement with expectations of fireball models @xcite .",
    "high - energy emission from  can have different physical origins at different phases .",
    "it is possible to evaluate a lower limit for the lorentz factor of the emitting regions in interval i and ii , on the basis of their spectral features and time - scale variability ( lithwich et al . 2001 ) .    during interval",
    "i the energy of the highest bin of the spectrum with significative detection is @xmath66 mev .",
    "a physical scenario with the minimum lorentz factor compatible with the data corresponds to a shell , optically thick for photons of energy greater than @xmath67 ( in the shell rest frame ) , moving with @xmath68 .",
    "otherwise , assuming that the emitting region is optically thin also for photons with energy greater than @xmath67 , a larger lorentz factor is needed ( @xmath69 ) , due to the fast variability during this phase , according with equation 5 in ( lithwich et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "emission during interval ii and following tail appears to be of a very different nature , and is clearly non - thermal .",
    "several mechanisms can be at work , depending on the external environment and radiative conditions .",
    "both synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) emitting regions characterized by impulsively energized particles can be important contributors .",
    "the ultimate origin of fast and efficient acceleration is believed to be hydrodynamical shocks produced by expanding matter ejecta .",
    "internal ( is ) and external ( es ) shocks can in principle contribute to both the synchrotron and ic emissions , and several models have been recently proposed to address the issue of the prompt vs. the so - called `` delayed '' high - energy emission from grbs . during interval ii",
    "the larger photon energy detected is @xmath70 mev .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor compatible with @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "we postpone an investigation of these issues to forthcoming publications .",
