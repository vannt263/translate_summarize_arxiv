    "the increasing interest in renewable energy leads scientific research to find a better way to recover most of the available energy .",
    "particularly , the maximum energy recoverable from wind is equal to 59.3% of that available ( betz law ) at a specific pitch angle and when the ratio between the wind speed in output and in input is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the pitch angle is the angle formed between the airfoil of the blade of the wind turbine and the wind direction .",
    "old turbine and a lot of that actually marketed , in fact , have always the same invariant geometry of the airfoil .",
    "this causes that wind turbines will work with an efficiency that is lower than 59.3% .",
    "new generation wind turbines , instead , have a system to variate the pitch angle by rotating the blades .",
    "this system allows the wind turbines to recover , at different wind speed , always the maximum energy , working in betz limit at different speed ratios .",
    "a powerful system control of the pitch angle allows the wind turbine to recover better the energy in transient regime . a good stochastic model for wind speed",
    "is then needed to help both the optimization of turbine design and to assist the system control to predict the value of the wind speed to positioning the blades quickly and correctly .",
    "the possibility to have synthetic data of wind speed is a powerful instrument to assist designer to verify the structures of the wind turbines or to estimate the energy recoverable from a specific site . to generate synthetic data , markov chains of first or higher order",
    "were often used @xcite . in particular in @xcite",
    "is presented a comparison between a first - order markov chain and a second - order markov chain . a similar work , but only for the first - order markov chain , is conduced by @xcite , presenting the probability transition matrix and comparing the energy spectral density and autocorrelation of real and synthetic wind speed data . a tentative to modeling and to join speed and direction of wind",
    "is presented in @xcite , by using two models , first - order markov chain with different number of states , and weibull distribution .",
    "the markov assumption is widely used in other closely related topics , see for example @xcite .",
    "all these models use markov chains to generate synthetic wind speed time series but the search for a better model is still open . approaching this issue , we applied new models which are generalization of markov models .",
    "more precisely we applied semi - markov models to generate synthetic wind speed time series .",
    "semi - markov processes ( smp ) are a wide class of stochastic processes which generalize at the same time both markov chains and renewal processes @xcite .",
    "they have been widely used in the literature to model natural phenomena ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "their main advantage is that of using whatever type of waiting time distribution for modeling the time to have a transition from one state to another one .",
    "this major flexibility has a price to pay : availability of data to estimate the parameters of the model which are more numerous .",
    "data availability is not an issue in wind speed studies , therefore , semi - markov models can be used in a statistical efficient way .    in this work we present three different semi - markov chain models : the first one is a first - order smp where the transition probabilities from two speed states ( at time @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) depend on the initial state ( the state at @xmath2 ) , final state ( the state at @xmath3 ) and on the waiting time ( given by @xmath4 ) .",
    "the second model is a second order smp where we consider the transition probabilities as depending also on the state the wind speed was before the initial state ( which is the state at @xmath5 ) and the last one is still a second order smp where the transition probabilities depends on the three states at @xmath6 and @xmath3 and on the waiting times @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the three models will be extensively explained in the next sections .",
    "the three models are used to generate synthetic time series for wind speed by means of monte carlo simulations and the time lagged autocorrelation function is used to compare statistical properties of the proposed models with those of real data and also with a time series generated though a simple markov chain .",
    "the probability density function of real and simulated data are also compared for the model which is recognized to be the best among the proposed ones .    in this paper , for the first time , different second order discrete time semi - markov chains are defined and general formulae of transition probabilities with initial and final backward are presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the stochastic models and we derive relevant results .",
    "section 3 demonstrates the models applied to a real dataset by testing the semi - markov hypothesis and by computing the autocorrelation functions and the probability density functions of the wind speed .",
    "finally section 4 presents some concluding remarks .",
    "semi - markov chains are a generalization of markov chains allowing the times between transitions to occur at random times according to any kind of distribution functions which may depend on the current and the next visited state .",
    "as it is well known , markov chains have sojourn times between transitions geometrically distributed , for this reason the memoryless property is preserved and no duration effect is observed . the more general semi - markov environment allows the possibility to use also no memoryless distributions and then can reproduce a duration effect .",
    "the duration effect affirms that the time the system is in a state influences its transition probabilities .",
    "the states of the process in our data are represented by different wind speed values , then in this paper we detect the presence of a duration effect in wind speed modeling and forecasting . given that the data on wind speed are recorded naturally in discrete time and in discrete values we develop also the theoretical model in discrete time and discrete values . + here below we propose a semi - markov model of order two in state and duration and we compare its performance with the markov chain models often used to describe wind speed , see @xcite and with some particular cases of our semi - markov chain model .",
    "+ let us consider a finite set of states @xmath9 in which the system can be into and a complete probability space @xmath10 on which we define the following random variables : @xmath11 they denote the state occupied at the n - th transition and the time of the n - th transition , respectively .",
    "to be more concrete , by @xmath12 we denote the wind speed at the nth transition and by @xmath3 the time of the nth transition of the wind speed process .",
    "we do the following conditional independence assumption : @xmath13\\\\ & \\quad = p[j_{n+1}=j , t_{n+1}-t_{n}= t |j_{n}=k , j_{n-1}=i , t_{n}-t_{n-1}=x ] : = \\,\\,_{x}q_{i.k , j}(t ) .",

    "we only compare here the pdf of real data and of the synthetic data from model iii because the fitting is already very good and there is very little space for improvement .",
    "wind speed is a stochastic process for which a completely satisfactory model is still lacking .",

    "the more suitable is a second order semi - markov process in state and duration .",
    "although the evidence shows the semi - markovian nature of the studied phenomenon , probably a third / fourth order semi - markov chain would be needed to decrease the difference between autocorrelation of real and simulated data . in our view",
    "this approach would be too much computationally and data consuming and further research on a simplified , but still with longer memory , model is needed . in this view",
