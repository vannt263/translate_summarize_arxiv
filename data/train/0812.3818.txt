    "when two systems are immersed in an environment , then , besides and at the same time with the quantum decoherence phenomenon , the environment can also generate a quantum entanglement of the two systems @xcite . in certain circumstances , the environment enhances the entanglement and in others it suppresses the entanglement and the state describing the two systems becomes separable .",
    "the structure of the environment may be such that not only the two systems become entangled , but also such that the entanglement is maintained for a definite time or a certain amount of entanglement survives in the asymptotic long - time regime .    in the present paper we investigate , in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the dynamics of the continuous - variable entanglement for a subsystem composed of two identical harmonic oscillators interacting with an environment .",
    "we are interested in discussing the correlation effect of the environment , therefore we assume that the two systems are independent , i.e. they do not interact directly .",
    "the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the quantum dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state .",
    "the organizing of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we write and solve the equations of motion in the heisenberg picture for two independent harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment . then , by using the peres - simon necessary and sufficient condition for separability of two - mode gaussian states @xcite , we investigate in sec .",
    "3 the dynamics of entanglement for the considered subsystem . in particular , with the help of the asymptotic covariance matrix , we determine the behaviour of the entanglement in the limit of long times .",
    "we show that for certain classes of environments the initial state evolves asymptotically to an equilibrium state which is entangled , while for other values of the parameters describing the environment , the entanglement is suppressed and the asymptotic state is separable .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "we study the dynamics of the subsystem composed of two identical non - interacting oscillators in weak interaction with an environment . in the axiomatic formalism based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the irreversible time evolution of an open system",
    "is described by the following general quantum markovian master equation for an operator @xmath0 ( heisenberg representation ) @xcite : @xmath1+{1\\over 2\\hbar}\\sum_j(v_j^{\\dagger}[a(t ) , v_j]+[v_j^{\\dagger},a(t)]v_j).\\label{masteq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath2 denotes the hamiltonian of the open system and the operators @xmath3 defined on the hilbert space of @xmath4 represent the interaction of the open system with the environment .",
    "being interested in the set of gaussian states , we introduce such quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve this set .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is taken to be a polynomial of second degree in the coordinates @xmath5 and momenta @xmath6 of the two quantum oscillators and @xmath7 are taken polynomials of first degree in these canonical observables . then in the linear space spanned by the coordinates and momenta there exist only four linearly independent operators @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 the hamiltonian @xmath2 of the two uncoupled identical harmonic oscillators of mass @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 is given by @xmath13    the fact that the evolution is given by a dynamical semigroup implies the positivity of the following matrix formed by the scalar products of the four vectors @xmath14 whose entries are the components @xmath15 respectively : @xmath16 we take this matrix of the following form , where all coefficients @xmath17 ... and @xmath18 are real quantities ( we put , for simplicity , @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 it follows that the principal minors of this matrix are positive or zero . from the cauchy - schwarz inequality the following relations for the coefficients defined in eq .",

    "this decomposition has a direct physical interpretation : the elements containing the diagonal contributions @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent diffusion and dissipation coefficients corresponding to the first , respectively the second , system in absence of the other , while the elements in @xmath29 represent environment generated couplings between the two , initially independent , oscillators .    we introduce the following @xmath30 bimodal covariance matrix : @xmath31 with the correlations of operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined by using the density operator @xmath34 , describing the initial state of the quantum system , as follows : @xmath35 by direct calculation we obtain @xcite ( @xmath36 denotes the transposed matrix ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 the time - dependent solution of eq .",
    "( [ vareq ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath39 where the matrix @xmath40 has to fulfill the condition @xmath41 in order that this limit exists , @xmath42 must only have eigenvalues with negative real parts .",
    "the values at infinity are obtained from the equation @xcite @xmath43",
    "the two - mode gaussian state is entirely specified by its covariance matrix ( [ covar ] ) , which is a real , symmetric and positive matrix with the following block structure : @xmath44 where @xmath0 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath23 matrices .",
    "their entries are correlations of the canonical operators @xmath47 , @xmath0 and @xmath45 denote the symmetric covariance matrices for the individual reduced one - mode states , while the matrix @xmath46 contains the cross - correlations between modes .",
    "the elements of the covariance matrix depend on @xmath42 and @xmath48 and can be calculated from eqs .",

    "since the two oscillators are identical , it is natural to consider environments for which the two diagonal submatrices in eq .",

    "first we analyze the existence of entanglement in the limit of large times . with the chosen coefficients ,",
    "we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ covarinf ] ) the following elements of the asymptotic entanglement matrix @xmath52 : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 the elements of matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 are obtained by putting @xmath58 in the previous expressions .",
    "we calculate the determinant of the entanglement matrix and obtain : @xmath59.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is interesting that the general theory of open quantum systems allows couplings via the environment between uncoupled oscillators .",
    "according to the definitions of the environment parameters , the diffusion coefficients above can be different from zero and therefore can simulate an interaction between the uncoupled oscillators .",
    "indeed , gaussian states with @xmath60 are separable states , but for @xmath61 it may be possible that the asymptotic equilibrium states are entangled , as will be shown next .",
    "on general grounds , one expects that the effects of decoherence , counteracting entanglement production , be dominant in the long - time regime , so that no quantum correlation ( entanglement ) is expected to be left at infinity .",
    "nevertheless , there are situations in which the environment allows the presence of entangled asymptotic equilibrium states . in order to investigate whether an external environment can actually entangle the two independent systems , we use the partial transposition criterion @xcite",
    ": a state is entangled if and only if the operation of partial transposition does not preserve its positivity .",
    "for the particular case of gaussian states , simon @xcite obtained the following necessary and sufficient criterion for separability : @xmath62 where @xmath63- \\frac{1}{4}(\\det a+\\det b ) \\label{sim1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath64 is the @xmath23 symplectic matrix @xmath65 in the following we consider an environment characterized by diffusion coefficients of the form @xmath66 this corresponds to the case when the asymptotic state is a gibbs state @xcite .",
    "then simon expression ( [ sim1 ] ) takes the following form in the limit of large times : @xmath67 for environments characterized by such coefficients that the expression @xmath68 ( [ sim2 ] ) is strictly negative , the asymptotic final state is entangled . in particular , for @xmath69 we obtain that @xmath70 i.e. the asymptotic final state is entangled , for the following range of values of the coefficient @xmath71 characterizing the environment @xcite : @xmath72 where the diffusion coefficient @xmath73 satisfies the condition @xmath74 equivalent with the unimodal uncertainty relation .",
    "we remind that , according to inequalities ( [ coefineq ] ) , the coefficients have to fulfill also the constraint @xmath75 if the coefficients do not fulfil the inequalities ( [ insep ] ) , then @xmath76 and the asymptotic state of the considered system is separable .",
    "we apply the measure of entanglement based on negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the subsystem density matrix . for a gaussian density operator ,",
    "the negativity is completely defined by the symplectic spectrum of the partial transpose of the covariance matrix . the logarithmic negativity @xmath77 $ ] determines the strength of entanglement for @xmath78 if @xmath79",

    "again , the coefficients have to fulfill the constraint @xmath85 so that in figure 1 only the part of the plot corresponding to @xmath86 has a physical meaning for our model .      in order to describe the dynamics of entanglement",

    "the entanglement is only temporarily generated and the state becomes again separable after a certain moment of time .",
    "in other cases , namely for even larger absolute values of the coefficient @xmath90 the generated entangled state remains entangled forever , including the asymptotic final state .",

    "this is the well - known phenomenon of entanglement sudden death .",
    "depending on the values of the coefficient @xmath91 , it is also possible to have a repeated collapse and revival of the entanglement .",

    "the existence of quantum correlations between the two considered harmonic oscillators interacting with a common environment is the result of the competition between entanglement and quantum decoherence .    due to the increased interest manifested towards the continuous - variable approach to quantum information theory , these results , in particular the possibility of maintaining a bipartite entanglement in a diffusive - dissipative environment for asymptotic long times , might be useful in controlling the entanglement in open systems and also for applications in quantum information processing and communication .",
