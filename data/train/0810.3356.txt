    "in constructing a representation ( a genome - to - phenotype map and a fitness function ) a ga practitioner implicitly determines how fitness gets distributed over a genome set .",
    "if a ga with this representation is adaptive then , with overwhelmingly high probability , the induced fitness distribution has some type of  structure \" that the ga is exploiting .",
    "there can be no other reason for the ga s performance .",
    "gas are frequently adaptive in practice .",
    "this entails that ga practitioners often construct representations that induce fitness distributions with ga - exploitable structure .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us clarify what me mean by the word  adaptive \" : given a search problem , we say that some population based search algorithm is _ adaptive _ if , across several runs with different random seeds , the average fitness of the population consistently trends upwards . by this token gas",
    "are often adaptive in practice , whereas population based random search is not .",
    "we refer to this feature of genetic algorithms as their _ adaptive capacity_.    we posit that _ _ any__coherent theory about the adaptive capacity of genetic algorithms must consist of the following : firstly a set of assumptions about the way fitness commonly gets distributed via the representational choices of ga practitioners ; we call these the _ commonplace fitness structure assumptions _ ( cfsas ) . and",
    "secondly , a hypothesis about how this fitness structure gets exploited by a ga during adaptation ; we call this the _ exploitation hypothesis _ ( eh ) .",
    "the exploitation hypothesis depends critically on the commonplace fitness structure assumption , but not vice - versa .",
    "the cfsas , in other words , are foundational . therefore ,",
    "when developing an explanation for the adaptive capacity of genetic algorithms , getting the cfsas right is extremely important .",
    "fundamentally flawed cfsas thwart the entire enterprise no matter how much effort is lavished upon the development and justification of the eh .",
    "practically any eh can be justified if one starts with sufficiently strong assumptions . to be viable an",
    "eh must be based upon cfsas that are _ weak_. this is nothing but an application of the principle of occam s razor , which holds that the weaker the assumptions that undergird a theory , the more viable the theory .",
    "this principle clearly makes sense in the current context .",
    "ga representations are completely ad - hoc .",
    "therefore the weaker our assumptions about the nature of the induced fitness structure , the more likely it is that these assumptions hold true .",
    "the building block hypothesis ( bbh ) is currently the dominant explanation for the adaptive capacity of simple genetic algorithms .",
    "though this hypothesis has come in for some ( at times sharp ) criticism in recent times , it remains the compass by which the vast majority of ga practitioners  past and present  have allowed themselves to be guided .",
    "it is also the first explanation for the adaptive capacity of gas that most students receive , and in this capacity surely exerts an anchoring effect @xcite on their reasoning .",
    "previously expressed skepticism of the building block hypothesis can be divided into two categories .",
    "the first consists of criticism of the weak theoretical foundations of this hypothesis ( for a survey see @xcite ) .",
    "proponents of the building block hypothesis have , for the most , part brushed aside criticism of this sort .",
    "goldberg , for example , calls such critiques  [ a ] favorite parlor game in genetic and evolutionary computation circles \" ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p7 ) , and , by way of analogy , characterizes such concerns as absurd . ",
    "[ t]he very idea that an airplane is ineffective or unsafe because a formal mathematical proof of flight does not exist is itself an absurdity . \" , he writes .  yet , if this is so  and no proof does exist of airplane flight  and if i  transform the aircraft into a _ genetic algorithm _  , why is it that [ this ] patently absurd alarm seems so real in the context of gas and their design and use ? \" ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p19 ) .",
    "the second category is comprised of skepticism arising from the anomalous performance of the simple genetic algorithm on some basic empirical tests ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) ) . in response",
    "to these results proponents of the building block hypothesis have downplayed the importance of the simple genetic algorithm @xcite , and have advocated the use other sorts of genetic algorithms ( e.g. cohort genetic algorithms ,  competent \" genetic algorithms ) , that are more complicated than the simple genetic algorithm , and typically contain mechanisms that are not biologically plausible . strictly speaking the building block hypothesis applies only to the simple genetic algorithm .",
    "therefore by downgrading the importance of the simple genetic algorithm proponents of the building block hypothesis can claim to have rendered skepticism about the veracity of this hypothesis irrelevant .",
    "the skepticism expressed in this paper does not belong to either of the two categories described above .",
    "it is , in a sense , more _ fundamental _ , stemming from a critical appraisal of the strength of the cfsas that undergird the building block hypothesis .",
    "we examine various influences  historical , social , and metaphysical  that have shaped these assumptions , and argue that the resulting cfsas are unacceptably strong . as these cfsas have largely been embraced by the designers of the new types of genetic algorithms mentioned in the previous paragraph , our criticism is also relevant to an evaluation of those algorithms .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ history ]",
    "we briefly recount the history of the building block hypothesis  its origin , ascent , and recent troubles . in section [ cfsas ]",
    "we describe the cfsas undergirding this hypothesis , and explain why we find them to be unacceptably strong . in sections",
    "[ appeal1 ] and [ appeal2 ] we critically examine the ways in which proponents of the building block hypothesis have sought to justify this hypothesis , and by extension , the cfsas that undergird it . in section [ looselinkage ]",
    "we explain the import of our criticism of these cfsas for the current direction of the field of genetic algorithmics . and",
    "finally as part of our conclusion , we draw parallels between the cfsas of the building block hypothesis , and the now defunct concept of luminiferous aether that was popular in nineteenth century theories about the propagation of light .",
    "scientific theories are typically presented without reference to the context within which they were developed ( * ? ? ? * p79 ) . at a certain level",
    "this of course makes sense ; surely what a scientist has for breakfast is immaterial to one s evaluation of her theories . at the same time , it has been observed that to genuinely understand the state of a science , an acquaintance with its history is essential .",
    "every scientific theory is undergirded by what the historian of science , thomas kuhn , calls _ received beliefs _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p4)assumptions transmitted from one generation to the next within a scientific community .",
    "an acquaintance with the history of a science can help one identify the origins of such assumptions and the circumstances under which they have have been perpetuated .",
    "in the 1960s and early 70s holland developed an abstract mathematical model of adaptive processes , what he called an _ adaptive plan _ , which was inspired by natural evolution but was of greater generality .",
    "holland sought to use this model to unify , under one theoretical framework , adaptation in such diverse fields as neuroscience , economics , control , game theory , artificial intelligence , and genetics .    for any adaptive process that generates only valid structures of some type",
    ", one can define a set @xmath0 of all possible valid structures that may be generated during the adaptive process .",
    "for example , in the domain of economic planning an element of @xmath0 may be a mix of goods ; in game - theory @xmath0 may be the set of all strategies with respect to some game ( * ? ? ?",
    "holland conceptualized adaptation as a process that generates samples from @xmath0 , concentrating these samples over time in subsets of @xmath0 of increasing average fitness .",
    "the central conceptual objects in holland s framework are subsets of @xmath0 called schemata ( singular schema ) .",
    "holland noted that each point in @xmath0 may belong simultaneously to several schemata .",
    "therefore an evaluation of the fitness of that point is , in effect , a fitness evaluation of a sample from each schema that the point belongs to .",
    "if the point is ` fit ' then this reflects well on all of those schemata , and vice - versa if the point is ` unfit ' .",
    "this observation suggested to holland the possibility of the existence of algorithms which , by testing small numbers of points , implicitly test vast numbers of schemata , and then implicitly use this information to concentrate trials in schemata of increasing average fitness .",
    "holland named this phenomenon _ intrinsic parallelism _",
    "* p74 ) , a name he later revised to _ implicit parallelism _ @xcite .",
    "holland also clearly seems to have been impressed by the utility of hierarchical assembly ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p168 ) ) .    in an argument that freely mixed speculation and deduction  the line between the two",
    "was typically left blurry ",
    "holland concluded that a specific adaptive plan that models natural evolution ",
    "what he called a _ genetic plan_can generate high - fitness solutions to difficult adaptation problems , and that this adaptive plan will do so using implicit parallelism and hierarchical assembly .",
    "starting in 1970 , holland s students began applying implementations of genetic plans to adaptation problems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they found that these algorithms typically outperformed random search . in a landmark dissertation de jong",
    "@xcite described experiments in which a stripped down version of the genetic plan  what is now called the simple genetic algorithm ",
    "was applied to a carefully contrived set of fitness functions with well - understood and diverse characteristics .",
    "de jong @xcite reports that  out of these early studies [ his and those of his colleagues ] emerged a picture of a ga as a robust adaptive search procedure , which was surprisingly effective as a global search heuristic \" .",
    "holland s theoretical work on genetic plans was seen as the obvious place to look for an explanation for the adaptive capacity of genetic algorithms .",
    "holland and his students simplified this work and settled upon the well known explanation that goes by the name of the building block hypothesis @xcite .      until the late 1980s the building block hypothesis seems to have gone relatively unquestioned . however , with the explosive increase in the popularity of the genetic algorithm came increasing scrutiny of its theoretical foundations .",
    "starting in the early 1990s several researchers began to publish independent ground - up theoretical analyses of the dynamics of genetic algorithms @xcite .",
    "what prompted these entirely new lines of theoretical analysis ?",
    "it is hard to say for certain , but we believe that at least part of the cause was frustration with the unclear demarcation between conjectures and mathematically provable facts that is characteristic of the argument of the argument for the building block hypothesis . in the preface to his book on the simple genetic algorithm vose @xcite writes ",
    "my central purpose in writing this book is to provide an introduction to what is known about the theory of the simple genetic algorithm .",
    "the rigor of mathematics is employed so as not to inadvertently repeat myths or recount folklore \" .",
    "he adds that the absence of core elements of  standard ga theory \" in his book is due to the unintelligibility , the irrelevance , or the mathematical unjustifyability of these elements . in a later work wright et .",
    "@xcite remark ,  the various claims about gas that are traditionally made under the name of the _ building block hypothesis _ have , to date , no basis in theory \" .    statements like these have served a vital purpose . despite its name ,",
    "the building block hypothesis had come to be treated as much more than a hypothesis .",
    "it had become the de - facto explanation for the success of genetic algorithms , thoroughly shaping the paradigm within which most ga research was conducted .",
    "for example , this hypothesis determined what constituted a valid question , a valid explanation , a valid prediction , and a valid enhancement of some genetic algorithm .",
    "given the assertive tone in which the building block used to be presented ( see @xcite ) , and the blurry line between deductive reasoning and conjecture in the argument for this hypothesis , students and non - theoreticians who were eager for an explanation can not not be blamed for surmising that the building block hypothesis is based largely on deductive reasoning .",
    "statements such as the ones reproduced above now serve to caution them against this notion .",
    "these statements have also served as a call to apologists to clearly describe their premises and modes of reasoning .",
    "the responses elicited ( e.g. @xcite ) , provide us with the clearest picture yet of the presumptions undergirding the building block hypothesis .",
    "let us quickly recount some basic elements of schema theory . in the case of genetic algorithms , @xmath0 is the set of all strings of some predetermined length drawn from some alphabet ( in what follows we assume that this alphabet is \\{0,1 } ) . let us call the elements of this set _",
    "genomes_. schemata are represented by so called ` similarity templates ' .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a set of strings of length 6 , then the schema 1 * 0**0 is the subset of strings in @xmath0 with 1 in the first position , zero in the third and sixth positions , and either 1 or 0 in the second , fourth , and fifth positions ; the * , called a ` wildcard ' , stands for ` do nt care ' .",
    "for the sake of brevity , a schema template is often just called a schema .",
    "it is important though to keep in mind the distinction between the two .",
    "given some population , the _ frequency _ of a schema is the number of genomes in the population that belong to that schema .",
    "a _ defining position _ of a schema is a position that is not a wildcard .",
    "the _ defining length _ of a schema is the difference between the indices of the last and first defining positions . finally , the _ order _ of a schema is the number of defining positions .",
    "thus , the defining length and order of the schema in the example above are five and three respectively .",
    "a schema with low defining - length ( and therefore low order ) is said to be ` short ' .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two subsets of @xmath3 . for a population of size @xmath4 ,",
    "let us say that the sampling fitness of @xmath1 is likely to be greater than ( or less than ) the sampling fitness of @xmath2 if there is a high probability that the average fitness of @xmath5 samples drawn uniformly from @xmath1 will be greater than ( or , respectively , less than ) the average fitness of @xmath6 samples drawn uniformly from @xmath2 .",
    "given some collection of subsets of @xmath3 with a non - empty intersection , we say that the intersection is _ consonant _ ( figure [ conantsyn]a ) if the sampling fitness of the intersection is not likely to be greater than or less than the sampling fitness of any of the intersecting subsets .",
    "we say that the intersection is _ antagonistic _ ( figure [ conantsyn]b ) if the sampling fitness of the intersection is likely to be less than the sampling fitness values of all the intersecting subsets .",
    "and we say that the intersection is _ synergistic _ ( figure [ conantsyn]c ) if the sampling fitness of the intersection is likely to be greater than the sampling fitness values of all the intersecting subsets .",
    "+   +    we define a _ basic building block _ to be a short schema with sampling fitness that is likely to be greater than the uniform sampling fitness of @xmath3 . a synergistic intersection between a small collection of basic building blocks is called a 2nd level building block , a synergistic intersection between a small collection of 2nd level building blocks is called a 3rd level building block , and so on .",
    "the building block hypothesis rests on ( at the very least ) the following two cfsas :    abundant basic building blocks : : :    a large number of basic building blocks exist .",
    "heirarchical synergism : : :    antagonistic intersections between the building blocks of any level    are rare , whereas synergistic intersections between small collections    of lower level building blocks are common .",
    "it seems to us that the number of ways in which these assumptions can be satisfied is vastly outnumbered by the number of ways in which they will not be satisfied .",
    "we trust that the reader , upon seeing these assumptions explicitly laid out , will agree that they are unacceptably strong",
    ". remember that we are talking about the structure of fitness functions induced by the ad - hoc decisions of ga practitioners engaged in solving poorly understood , or np - hard problems .    in the following sections we examine two ways in which proponents of the building block hypothesis have attempted to justify their belief in these assumptions ",
    "an appeal to certain metaphysical positions , and an appeal to authority .",
    "in support of the building block hypothesis holland has asserted the _ building block thesis_. he describes this thesis as follows :  the  building block thesis \" holds that most of what we know about the world pivots on descriptions and mechanisms constructed from elementary building blocks. he characterizes building blocks as  parts \" such that ",
    "( i ) they must be easy to identify ( once they ve been discovered or picked out ) , and ( ii ) they must be readily recombined to form a wide variety of structures ( much as can be done with children s building blocks ) \" .    the way this building block thesis is phrased it is a statement about what is already known about the world rather than a universal law , which is how holland goes on to use it .",
    "our most sympathetic rephrasing of the building block thesis in light of the way holland uses it to support the building block hypothesisis is as follows : building blocks play a key role in the structure and function of most objects and processes .",
    "building blocks are ( i ) parts of wholes , ( ii ) easily identifiable , and ( iii ) recombinable with other building blocks to form a wide variety of forms .",
    "it is necessary to quote holland at length so as not to leave out any part of his argument for this thesis .",

    "the most generous way to regard the building block  thesis \" is as a metaphysical theory of pan - modularity and pan - hierarchism .",
    "should this new way of regarding holland s  thesis \" allay our concerns about the building block hypothesis ?",
    "it should not .",
    "indeed _ any _ hypothesis can be justified by first asserting a generalization of the hypothesis as a new metaphysical position , and then using the metaphysical position to argue in favor of the specific hypothesis .",
    "it is clear from his writings that holland views the building block hypothesis as a straightforward generalization of fisher s theory of adaption ( ( * ? ? ? *",
    "p89 ) ; @xcite)a generalization indeed that , to holland s mind , rests on much _ weaker _ assumptions than fisher s .",
    "fisher s theory currently reigns as the orthodox view in population genetics , so it is understandable that holland finds it exasperating that the building block hypothesis should meet with the kind of criticism it has received from certain quarters within the genetic algorithmics community ( see @xcite ) .    in this section",
    "we describe some of fisher s assumptions , highlight their extraordinary strength , and examine the circumstances under which these assumptions became part of the orthodoxy of population genetics .",
    "it is important to stress that the adoption of fisher s assumptions by population geneticists , though pervasive , is by no means unanimous .",
    "accordingly , we will review some of the criticism that has been leveled at these assumptions .",
    "finally we compare holland s assumptions with fisher s .",
    "we argue that the extent by which the former are weaker than the latter has been exaggerated , and explain how holland s assumptions are in fact stronger than fisher s in an important respect .      for almost two decades after the discovery , in 1900 , of his paper on inheritance in pea plants , mendel s theory of particulate inheritance",
    "was thought to be at odds with the theory of adaptation by natural selection proposed by darwin and wallace .",
    "the _ mendelians _ argued that new species arise not by gradual changes , but by large jumps  called saltations  caused by macromutations .",
    "such mutations ( which were assumed to occur infrequently ) were thought to be the main drivers of adaptation .",
    "natural selection on the other hand was thought to play at best a minor part  that of mopping up deleterious macromutations .",
    "though this point of view was never articulated by mendel himself , his name became associated with researchers such as devries , bateson and johansen who used the results of mendel s paper to downplay the effects of natural selection ( p 777 mayr ) .",
    "opposing them , the _ biometricians _ ( e.g. pearson , and weldon ) noted that gradualness abounds in nature , and argued that evolution consists of a gradual shift of an entire population rather than the creation of new types by macromutation . the biometricians made extensive use of statistics to study the effect of natural selection on phenotypic distributions and claimed superiority over the mendelians on account of their commitment to mathematical rigor ( the mendelians in turn trumpeted their fidelity to empiricism ) . by and large the biometricians rejected mendelian inheritance ( * ? ? ?",
    "this may seem odd in this day and age , but remember that we are discussing a time that predates the discovery of the material basis of inheritance ( chromosomes comprised of dna ) , as well as the mechanism of inheritance ( meiosis ) .    the possibility of reconciling the views of the mendelians with those of the biometricians had been considered by yule , and parson as early as 1902 .",
    "however it is fisher s paper , published in 1918 , on  the correlation of relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance \" that is widely regarded as marking the beginning of the synthesis of these two purportedly irreconcilable theories into a single theory of evolution  what we now call the _",
    "modern synthesis_.    in this paper , fisher , himself an eminent statistician , presented a mathematical model that incorporated natural selection and mendelian inheritance , and used it , amongst other things , to calculate correlations between certain traits in relatives .",
    "he argued that his model could account for published biometric data @xcite which pearson ( a biometrician ) had previously used to question the adequacy of mendelian inheritance .",
    "fisher s use of pearson s own data to challenge pearson s position was seen as a coup dtat of sorts .",
    "provine ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p147 ) reports that  fisher s 1918 paper was well received by the few geneticists who could understand his mathematics \" . at any rate , there seems to have been no alarm over the remarkably strong assumptions undergirding fisher s work . what were these assumptions ?    in fisher s model",
    "a quantitative trait ( e.g. stature , i.e. height ) is under the influence of multiple genes , each with multiple allelic instantiations .",
    "fisher assumed that the effects of allele substitutions in an individual were constant and combined additively .",
    "this assumption entails that the substitution of one allele for another always has the same additive effect on the value of the trait , regardless of the genetic background in which the allele substitution occurs . to be fair fisher",
    "did discuss the possibility that the effects of gene substitutions might not combine additively .",
    "he called this condition _ epistacy _ , a term he later revised to epistasis . early in the paper fisher urged his readers to treat epistasis and the effects of the environment as one might regard  an arbitrary error introduced into the measurements \" , in other words , as noise .",
    "later he returned to show how the case when epistasis is not well modeled by noise might be dealt with .",
    "unfortunately , his treatment is rather incomplete ; he limited himself to addressing ",
    "deviations from linearity as may exist between two factors \" , but not more , because ( amongst other things ) he deemed such higher order deviations ",

    "importantly , considerations of epistasis did not figure into fisher s accounting for the biometric data of pearson and lee .",

    "the appeal of scientific theories lies , certainly not in their comparative succinctness ( scientific explanations are always longer ) , but in the comparative parsimony of the _ assumptions _ involved .",

    "a building block can then be ( incompletely ) described as a small set of closely located genes amongst which credit can not be apportioned , i.e. a set of genes with epistatic interactions .",
    "as building blocks are assumed to be abundant , proponents of the building block hypothesis feel justified in claiming that the building block hypothesis accommodates the existence of pervasive epistasis , and therefore rests on assumptions that are much weaker than fisher s .",
    "a less cozy picture however emerges if one defines a gene more in line with its definition in population genetics .",
    "the word  gene \" was coined by the danish geneticist wilhelm johansen in 1909 , at a time when the particulate nature of inheritance could only be surmised by observing differences between generations of phenotypes .",
    "johansen used the word gene to stand for a _ unit of inheritance _ passed on from parent to child in an all - or - nothing fashion .",
    "the theories of the founders of population genetics  fisher , wright , haldane  all make use of these fictitious units . later , as the physical basis of inheritance started to become clear , molecular biologists began to identify a gene with any regulatory , transcribed , and/or other functional region of dna .",
    "unfortunately this use of the term  gene \" is not consistent with its use in population genetics . in order to maintain consistency with the theoretical work of their field s founders ,",
    "population geneticists typically identify a gene with a chromosomal extent that tends to be inherited in an all - or - nothing fashion , i.e. a chromosomal extent that is short enough that it tends not to be broken up by crossover ( * ? ? ?",
    "this is not a strict definition , like say that of a triangle , but instead has a  fading - out \" quality that is contingent upon the expected number of crossover points and the way they tend to be distributed over the genome .",
    "if we focus on gas with @xmath10-point crossover where @xmath10 is small , then in light of the above , any short schema with contiguous defining positions is a gene . given this definition of a gene ,",
    "note that any building block must be comprised of one or more genes with above average fitness .",
    "for example , if * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 10 * 1 * * * is a building block , then one or both of the genes * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 1001 * * * , and * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 1011 * * * must have above average fitness . given the above it is easy to see how the building block hypothesis and the assumptions that undergird it can be described entirely in terms of genes .",
    "taking this perspective allows us to compare fisher s assumptions with those of holland .",
    "both fisher and holland assumed the existence of a large number of genes with higher than average fitness .",
    "fisher essentially assumed that _ any _ collection of such genes intersects synergistically .",
    "holland , assumed a ) that synergistic intersections between small collections of such genes is common , b ) that antagonistic intersections between any collection of such genes is rare , and c ) that this pattern applies hierarchically . to be sure these three assumptions about the distribution of fitness _ are _ weaker than fisher s .",
    "however , given the extraordinary strength of fisher s assumptions , that s not saying much .",
    "fisher and holland also differ in the way they deal with the problem of sampling error . by assuming an infinite panmictic ( i.e. fully mixing ) population , fisher dispensed with the need for the average fitness values of the alleles of each gene to be significantly different .",
    "this is because in an infinite panmictic population evolution can act on differences between these values no matter how small the differences . in other words , by making a strong assumption about the size of the evolving population fisher was able to avoid making a strong assumption about the distribution of fitness . because gas used in practice tend to have small populations ",
    "typically no more than 1000 individuals  an escape of this sort is clearly not available to genetic algorithm theorists    nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge the issue of sampling error has not been addressed by proponents of the building block hypothesis . by insisting that the building block hypothesis explains the adaptive capacity of gas with small populations , and by making no effort to address the issue of sampling error that arises when one takes this position , these proponents are , in effect , making the assumption that each basic building block is comprised of at least one gene whose sampling fitness is likely to be so far above average that evolution will propagate this gene despite the inevitable sampling error that accompanies the evolution of small populations .",
    "the assumption that basic building blocks are abundant entails the extraordinarily strong assumption that the genes that comprise them are also abundant .",
    "while proponents of the building block hypothesis seem to be comfortable with the strong assumption that low - order schemata with above average sampling fitness are abundant , they are less enthusiastic about assuming abundance when it is also stipulated that the schemata must be short . in other words , these proponents are uncomfortable assuming that the defining positions of basic building blocks are  tightly linked \" , i.e. close together .    their wariness about this assumption can be traced back to holland s contention in his seminal treatise @xcite that the defining bits of building blocks may well be dispersed throughout the genome ( i.e. loosely linked ) .",
    "holland considered this to be a significant problem . to deal with it",
    "he introduced the _ inversion _ operator which reverses the order of the bits of a randomly chosen snippet of a genome while preserving the genome s semantics ( * ? ? ?",
    "holland asserted that over several generations inversion , in combination with crossover and selection , will tighten the linkage between the defining positions of schemata with above average fitness in an  intrinsically parallel fashion \" ( * ? ? ? * p109 ) .",
    "the inversion operator was not found to be useful in practice @xcite , and the study of inversion did not become an active area of research .",
    "however , the loose linkage problem that inversion was supposed to solve took on a life of its own  it became a de facto explanation for poor ga performance , and has captured the attention and creative energies of a sizeable section of the ga community . a large number of algorithms with explicit  linkage learning \" schemes have been developed to deal with this perceived problem e.g. mga and the fmga @xcite , gemga , @xcite , llga @xcite , ecga @xcite , fda @xcite , lfda @xcite , boa @xcite , hboa @xcite , seam @xcite .",
    "what seems to have been overlooked in this flurry of activity is that the assumption of tight linkage between the defining positions of basic building blocks is just one of a number of strong assumptions undergirding the building block hypothesis .",
    "consciously or otherwise , these other assumptions  the _ abundance _ of basic building blocks , and hierarchical synergism  have been embraced by the inventors of the algorithms listed above .",

    "why , after all , would an engineer care to study the workings of an algorithm deemed the poor cousin of more  competent \" algorithms ?",
    "what is a genetic algorithm ? is it    ( a ) : :    an algorithmic model of natural evolution in which selection ,    crossover , and mutation are iteratively applied to a population of    strings , or ( b ) : :    an algorithm that implements the process described in the building    block hypothesis    proponents of the building block hypothesis regard both ( a ) and ( b ) as valid descriptions of a genetic algorithm .",
    "however , of the two descriptions , their loyalty seems to reside with description ( b ) .",
    "holland , for example , writes  the very essence of good ga design is retention of diversity , furthering exploration , while exploiting building blocks already discovered \" most researchers in the field however readily agree with description ( a ) , but need to be convinced that ( b ) is also a valid description .",
    "the theoretical basis of the argument by which bbh proponents attempt to convince us of the validity of description ( b ) has been sharply criticized .",
    "unfortunately criticism of this sort has been brushed aside by bbh proponents who continue to insist that ( b ) is a valid description .",
    " what is it that people do when they are being innovative in a cross - fertilizing sense ? \" , asks goldberg . ",
    "usually they are grasping at a notion  a set of good solution features  in one context , and a notion in another context and juxtaposing them , thereby speculating that the combination might be better than either notion taken individually \" ( * ? ? ?",
    "goldberg calls the attribution to genetic algorithms of this purported process of human innovation the _ fundamental intuition of genetic algorithms_. one of the ways in which he attempts to justify this _ de facto _ attribution is by reproducing a quote by the french mathematician jacques hadamard , from a book entitled  the psychology of invention in the mathematical field \" :  indeed , it is obvious that invention or discovery be it in mathematics or anywhere else , takes place by combining ideas \" .",
    "no one can deny the aesthetic appeal of the building block hypothesis ",
    "least of all computer scientists , weaned ( as we typically are ) on the virtues and use of modularity .",
    "that genetic algorithms might be constructing solutions to problems much as we do  by identifying important modules , and composing them together  is a truly exciting prospect .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in this paper , some extraordinarily strong assumptions about the distribution of fitness have to hold true in order for this prospect to be realized .",
    "the history of science is replete with conceptual entities that were highly popular for a while , but were later jettisoned because of the extraordinary strength of the assumptions one had to embrace .",
    "one such entity is the luminiferous ( i.e. light bearing ) aether , which , for much of the nineteenth century was assumed to be the medium through which light traveled .",
    "light , like all waves , bends around objects ( diffraction ) , changes direction upon striking a reflective surface ( reflection ) or entering a new medium ( refraction ) , can be split into components with different frequencies ( dispersion ) , and displays interference patterns .",
    "physicists in the nineteenth century assumed that the propagation of light , like the propagation of all waves known at the time , requires the mechanical disturbance of some physical medium .",
    "this medium was called luminiferous aether .    on the one hand",
    "the concept of luminiferous aether proved very useful because it allowed physicists to account for phenomena like diffraction which presented serious problems for a corpuscular theory of light ; on the other hand this concept presented some serious difficulties of its own . for example , the aether had to be extremely rigid in order to support the high frequencies of light . at the same time , because it did not seem to have any observable effect on the orbits of the planets , it had to be devoid of mass and viscosity ! paradoxes like these occupied the minds of some of the finest physicists during the latter half of nineteenth century and into the early twentieth .",
    "ultimately , the existence of the aether was obviated by the less presumptive theories of maxwell ( who cast light as a electromagnetic wave , _ not _ dependent on the mechanical properties of an aether ) , and einstein ( specifically his work on wave - particle duality and special relativity ) .",
    "the luminiferous aether , in other words , fell to occam s razor .",
    "will building blocks go the way of luminiferous aether ?",
    "time will tell . at this point",
    "what we _ can _ say is that certain parallels between the two are unmistakeable .",
    "both are the result of extrapolation  of the mechanical basis of wave propagation in the second case , and of the purported process underlying _ human _ innovation in the first  and both require believers to embrace , whether consciously or otherwise , assumptions so strong that they seem almost magical ."
