    "surely one of the most striking features of matter refers to the fact that one encounters two distinct types of particles : fermions and bosons .",
    "as safely as this fact is established from both the conceptual and experimental point of view ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it seems unclear for most people what is the precise theoretical origin of this matter dichotomy and why there do not exist more than two kinds of material particles . in view of the lack of a right understanding of the reason why there are only two particle species ,",
    "some people hold that one must first `` _ _ understand why nature makes such a particular choice from among a host of other possibilities _ _ ''  @xcite . consequently for that purpose , they believe",
    ", one should `` _ _ pursue every theoretical possibility we may conceive at present _ _ ''  @xcite and these endeavours should refer to the rather general framework of paraquantization .",
    "other people do not trouble themselves about the true origin of the fermion - boson dichotomy but take this simply as an experimentally based fact , and consequently they are content with rephrasing this fact in mathematical terms ( i.e.  the postulates of symmetrization for bosons and anti - symmetrization for fermions ) . in this sense , e.g. , dirac simply states that `` _ _ other more complicated kinds of symmetry are possible mathematically , but do not apply to any known particles _ _ '' ( ref .",
    "@xcite ,  p.  211 ) .",
    "one could go even one step further by resorting to the well - known _ anthropic principle _",
    "@xcite which may be evoked whenever a well - established observation can not be based upon a sound theoretical foundation .",
    "such a situation typically occurs in cosmology  @xcite but the present fermion - boson dichotomy could also evoke that principle , e.g. by asking : `` _ did god - for lack of a better word - build a series of failed worlds which spottered and died , or exploded and disintegrated , before discovering the stabilizing effect of anti - commutation relations for half - integral spin fields ? _ ''",
    "@xcite ,  p.",
    "however it rather seems reasonable to assume that the fermion - boson dichotomy `` _ could conceivably be an essential ingredient of a more fundamental view of the world   this could be the case in fundamental string theories or their successors   _ ''  @xcite .",
    "in any case , such an unclarified situation with the matter dichotomy should provide sufficient motivation for studying this problem also within the context of non - standard quantum theories . in this sense",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of the matter dichotomy within the framework of relativistic schrdinger theory ( rst ) , an alternative form of quantum theory being based upon fluid - dynamic concepts rather than probabilistic ones  @xcite -@xcite .",
    "indeed it has turned out that a matter dichotomy emerges in this theory in the form of positive and negative mixtures  @xcite resembling very much the symmetrized ( bosonic ) and anti - symmetrized ( fermionic ) states of the conventional quantum theory : the positive mixtures imply a certain kind of _ fusion _ of two particles into one charge density , and the negative mixtures describe the recession of the two charge densities from one another such that the density of one particle is zero in that region of space - time where the density of the other particle is non - zero ( charge separation  @xcite ) . consequently both particles in a negative - mixture configuration are forbidden to occupy the same space - time points which evidently yields a `` stabilizing effect '' for composite matter coming about in the conventional quantum theory through the anti - symmetrization postulate ( or anti - commutation postulate for operators , resp . ) .",
    "however before plunging deeply into the physical implications of this rst matter dichotomy , one first would like to understand better both the differences and the common features of both types of rst mixtures from a purely _ mathematical _ point of view . in this sense ,",
    "the present paper presents a detailed study of the geometric and topological properties of both types of mixture configurations , deferring the discussion of the physical implications to a separate treatment . for the purpose of a survey of the corresponding results ,",
    "it is very instructive to first recall some of the basic ( probabilistic ) concepts of the conventional quantum theory and oppose these to the analogous kinematical elements of the ( fluid - dynamic ) rst .",
    "since , on the conventional side , there exists no successful _ relativistic _ quantum mechanics for many - particle systems ( in contrast to the very successful quantum field theory ) , we have to restrict ourselves here to a comparison of the _ non - relativistic _ conventional theory with rst ( as a fully relativistic theory ) .",
    "furthermore we are satisfied in the present paper with a treatment of 2-particle systems ( neglecting also the particle spin ) which may be sufficient to display already the essential many - particle effects .",
    "( for including also the spin into rst see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      since in the conventional theory",
    "the 2-particle hilbert space is the tensor product of the two 1-particle spaces , a _ disentangled _",
    "2-particle state  @xmath2 is simply the product of two 1-particles states  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 in contrast to this product construction , a disentangled 2-particle state  @xmath6 in rst is the direct sum of the two 1-particle states @xmath7 or reformulated in mathematical terms : the 2-particle vector bundle ( with the rst 2-particle wave function  @xmath6 as bundle section ) is the whitney sum of both 1-particle bundles .",
    "if some interaction between the particles is switched - on ( e.g.  the electromagnetic interactions , especially the static coulomb interaction ) the conventional state  ( [ eq : prod ] ) can not retain its simple product form  ( [ eq : prod ] ) but develops into a general 2-particle state  @xmath8 obeying the symmetrization postulate @xmath9 in contradiction to certain claims in the older literature , the modern textbooks clearly state that _  this postulate _ ( expressing the matter dichotomy in the conventional theory )",
    "_ can not be deduced from other principles of quantum mechanics  _ ( ref .",
    "@xcite ,  p.  475 ) .",
    "if the interparticle interactions are switched - off again , the generally entangled 2-particle state  @xmath10  ( [ eq : syp ] ) does not return to the original disentangled form  ( [ eq : prod ] ) but develops to a simply entangled state  @xmath11 which is build up again by two 1-particle states but still obeys the symmetrization postulate  ( [ eq : syp ] ) @xmath12 this form of the wave function persists even when the particles are localized at large spatial separation and thus gives rise to the well - known einstein - podolsky - rosen paradoxes  @xcite .      according to the whitney sum construction  ( [ eq : sum ] ) ( in place of the conventional product arrangement  ( [ eq : prod ] ) ) , the concept of _ entanglement _ is defined in rst in a somewhat different way , namely by describing matter by means of a ( hermitian ) intensity matrix  @xmath13 in place of a wave function @xmath14 .",
    "the disentangled rst states  @xmath14  ( [ eq : sum ] ) can also be written in form of an intensity matrix  @xmath13 but here  @xmath13 adopts a special form , namely the tensor product of  @xmath14 and its hermitian conjugate  @xmath15 , see equation  ( [ eq : ipsi ] ) below .",
    "a disentangled rst state  @xmath14  ( [ eq : sum ] ) obeys the relativistic schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : rse ] ) and an entangled rst configuration  @xmath13 ( a `` mixture '' ) satisfies the relativistic von neumann equation  ( [ eq : cali ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian  @xmath16 , governing both these field equations  ( [ eq : rse ] ) and ( [ eq : cali ] ) , is itself a dynamical object of the theory and has to be determined from its field equations  ( [ eq : intcond ] ) and  ( [ eq : coneq ] ) .",
    "all these rst prerequisites , being indispensable for the subsequent mathematical elaborations , have been collected into * section  ii*.    however , the crucial point with the matter dichotomy is now that it arises in rst as a direct consequence of the rst dynamics itself and not as an additional kinematical postulate as in the conventional theory  ( [ eq : syp ] ) .",
    "this is proven in * section  iii * for an arbitrary number  @xmath17 of ( scalar ) particles .",
    "the rst dichotomy consists in the fact that the determinant of the  @xmath18 intensity matrix  @xmath13 is always of definite sign for any mixture type , see the corresponding discussion of the equation  ( [ eq : dndetin ] ) below , together with fig .  1 .",
    "thus , in rst there occur exactly two forms of matter , namely the positive and negative mixtures ; this is in contrast to the conventional theory which has its problems with the _ theoretical _ exclusion of the higher - order multiplets of the symmetric group of identical particle permutations @xcite , leaving over only the symmetric and anti - symmetric states as its lowest - order representations .",
    "after the matter dichotomy has thus been safely established for a general n - particle system , we restrict ourselves for the remainder of the paper to the _ 2-particle systems ( n=2)_. therefore in * section iv * all relevant rst mathematics is specialized down to the 2-particle case which requires as the typical fibre of the vector bundle the two - dimensional complex space  @xmath19 ( and its tensor - product associates ) . the interesting point with the rst",
    "2-particle kinematics is here that one can reparametrize the whole field system by single - particle variables and by exchange fields .",
    "this is again in contrast to the conventional theory which ( for an entangled state ) does attribute one single 2-particle wave function  @xmath8  ( [ eq : syp])-([eq : syp2 ] ) to both particles but does not attribute a 1-particle wave function to either particle .    as a consequence of this kinematic peculiarity",
    ", one can clearly identify in rst the exchange forces ( different from the gauge forces ) which are responsible for the fusion effects of the positive mixtures ( @xmath20  bosonic states ) and separation effects of the negative mixtures ( @xmath20  fermionic states ) .",
    "indeed the mixture variable  @xmath21 enters the single - particle rst dynamics  ( [ e4:44 ] ) together with the exchange fields  @xmath22 in form of a potential term so that one arrives at the disentangled 2-particle situation ( i.e. pure rst state  @xmath6  ( [ eq : sum ] ) analogous to the conventional  @xmath2  ( [ eq : prod ] ) ) when one puts the exchange fields to zero .",
    "such a disentangled rst situation can then be described by two ordinary klein - gordon equations  ( [ e4:46 ] ) , namely one equation for either particle .",
    "this rst picture of how the exchange forces produce the fusion and separation effects has no counterpart in the conventional theory , where it is not possible to trace back the pauli exclusion principle to the action of some kind of force preventing , say , a fermion from occupying the same quantum state as an other identical fermion ( see the discussion of this problem in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    but with a convenient parametrization of the 2-particle systems being now at hand , one can study the geometric and topological differences of both kinds of mixture configurations ( * section  v * ) . here , the point of departure is the observation that the dynamical equations ( of section  iv ) ensure the existence of a closed 2-form  @xmath23 which is composed of the mixture variable  @xmath24 and the exchange fields  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 , see equation  ( [ e5:1 ] ) below .",
    "it is just the process of revealing the origin of the closedness of  @xmath27 which yields a detailed demonstration of the mathematical peculiarities of the mixtures :    first it can be shown that  @xmath27 is the euler class of an appropriately constructed fibre bundle over space - time ( density bundle ) so that the closedness relation for  @xmath27  ( [ e5:3 ] ) appears as nothing else than the bianchi identity for the bundle curvature .",
    "next it is proven that the winding numbers of the euler class  @xmath27 are always zero and thus  @xmath27 is an _ exact _",
    "2-form over space - time ( * * e**=*de * , see equation  ( [ e5:5 ] ) ) .",
    "the origin of the exactness of  @xmath27 lies in the fact that  @xmath27 is the pullback of the surface 2-cell of the one - parted hyperboloid  @xmath28 for the negative mixtures and of the two - parted hyperboloid  @xmath29 for the positive mixtures , see fig .  1 .",
    "since these two surfaces  @xmath30 carry different topologies ( @xmath28 is infinitely connected , the connected components of  @xmath29 are simply connected ) , a positive - mixture configuration can never be continously deformed into a negative mixture ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this may be considered as the rst counterpart of the fermion - boson superselection rule of the conventional theory which is of purely phenomenological character .",
    "the 2-particle configurations admit a concrete geometric realization if the underlying space - time manifold ( as the base space of the applied fibre bundles ) is parallelisable .",
    "as is well - known in differential geometry , any parallelisable manifold admits a _ global _ frame of tangent vectors and thus admits the introduction of a _ flat _ connection for its tangent bundle",
    "( though this does not imply in general the flatness of the tangent metric @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the rst 2-particle mixtures require the existence of a trivial principal lorentz bundle over space - time , whose sections generate a flat lorentz connection via the ( pullback of the ) maurer - cartan form over the lorentz group @xmath31 .",
    "the reduction of this 4-frame to a 2-frame then generates the bundle geometry of the 2-particle mixtures ( * section  vi * ) .",
    "in order to present the subsequent discussions in a sufficiently self - contained form , we briefly sketch the rst fundamentals with emphasis of those aspects which lead to the emergence of the matter dichotomy , the main subject of the present paper . according to the rst claim of representing a general theory of matter",
    ", we evoke the mathematical framework of fibre bundles over the pseudo - riemannian space - time as the base space and we identify the corresponding bundle connection with the physical gauge potentials according to the principle of minimal coupling .    thus the coordinate - covariant derivative  @xmath32 refers to the levi - civita connection  @xmath33 of the pseudo - riemannian fibre metric  @xmath34 in the tangent bundle of space - time , the gauge potential  @xmath35 acts as the bundle connection in the complex vector bundles over space - time ( with typical fibre  @xmath36 ) .",
    "the gauge - plus - coordinate covariant derivative of a bundle section is thus  @xmath37 .",
    "the n - component wave function  @xmath14 represents a section of the vector bundle and the intensity matrix  @xmath13 ( generalizing the concept of wave function ) is a hermitian section  @xmath38 of the product bundle whose typical fibre is the tensor product @xmath39 of the vector fibres  @xmath36 .",
    "further examples of operator - valued sections are the anti - hermitian field strength  @xmath40 as the curvature of the connection  @xmath41 @xmath42 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the hamiltonian  @xmath43 ( being neither hermitian nor anti - hermitian ) may be split up into its ( anti- ) hermitian parts as follows @xmath44 here , both the kinetic field  @xmath45 and the localization field  @xmath46 are hermitian @xmath47 and build up the ( anti-)hermitian constituents of the hamiltonian  @xmath16 .",
    "the basic dynamical equations of the theory may be considered here in a purely formal view as mathematically consistent links between those rst objects mentioned above .",
    "the first equation to be mentioned is the relativistic schrdinger equation ( rse ) for the wave function  @xmath14 @xmath48 or its generalization , resp . , the relativistic von neumann equation ( rne ) for the intensity matrix  @xmath13 : @xmath49\\ .\\ ] ] contrary to schrdinger s non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the relativistic hamiltonian  @xmath16 is here not a rigid object , to be fixed a priori , but is a dynamical variable obeying its own field equations .",
    "the first of these is the `` _ integrability condition _ ''",
    "@xmath50=i\\hbar c { { \\mathcal{f}}}_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] and the second is the `` _ conservation equation _ ''",
    "@xmath51 with  @xmath52 being the mass operator , i.e.  for identical particles of mass m @xmath53      the meaning of the integrability condition  ( [ eq : intcond ] ) is to ensure the existence of ( local ) solutions for the rst dynamics , but the conservation equation  ( [ eq : coneq ] ) implies the existence of certain conservation laws , such as the charge conservation for  @xmath17 particles  @xmath54 @xmath55 or the energy - momentum law @xmath56 here the lorentz force density  @xmath57 is being composed of the field strength  @xmath58 and the currents  @xmath59 as usual @xmath60 where the ( hermitian ) force operator  @xmath61 is given by  @xcite @xmath62 clearly if the energy - momentum content of the gauge field is included in the energy - momentum density  @xmath63 , one has the usual energy - momentum conservation law  @xcite for the total system @xmath64    the last equation , closing the whole dynamical system , is taken as the ( generally non - abelian ) maxwell equation @xmath65    ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "thus in the last step , it remains to specify the current operator  @xmath67 in terms of the matter variable  @xmath13 and then one has a closed dynamical system . the desired relationship between the intensity matrix  @xmath13 and current  @xmath67 is obtained by decomposing the current operator  @xmath67 with respect to the generators  @xmath68 of the gauge group @xmath69 and then defining the current components  @xmath70 as @xmath71 where the velocity operators read in terms of the hamiltonian  @xmath16 for scalar particles @xmath72 ( the velocity operator for a spinning particle coincides with the dirac matrices :  @xmath73  @xcite ) .",
    "one can easily show that this arrangement automatically guarantees the validity of the charge conservation laws  ( [ eq : chcon ] ) as a consequence of the rst dynamics with no need of additional requirements .",
    "such a pleasant effect occurs also for the energy - momentum laws  ( [ eq : enlaw ] ) and  ( [ eq : encon ] ) .",
    "indeed it is possible to define the energy - momentum content of matter  @xmath63 in such a way that the laws  ( [ eq : enlaw ] ) and  ( [ eq : encon ] ) are _ automatically _ obeyed again as an implication of the rst dynamics itself .",
    "more concretely , one defines the energy momentum density  @xmath63 as @xmath74 with the energy - momentum operator  @xmath75 for scalar particles being given through @xmath76\\ , \\ ] ] ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the energy - momentum operator of dirac particles ) .",
    "if the gravitational interactions are to be included , one adds the einstein equations to the rst dynamics which however enforces the energy - momentum conservation law  ( [ eq : encon ] ) as a consistency condition , in place of the weaker source equation  ( [ eq : enlaw ] ) .",
    "the stronger condition  ( [ eq : encon ] ) is attained by adding the energy - momentum density of the gauge field to that of the matter field  ( [ eq : ttrit ] ) which then yields a closed system with the strong law  ( [ eq : encon ] ) playing the part of a closedness condition  @xcite .",
    "the preceding examples of _ automatic _ conservation laws have been presented in such a great detail because , for the present purpose of demonstrating the emergence of a rst matter dichotomy , it is important to have a further such automatic consequence of the rst dynamics : namely the emergence of a scalar amplitude field  @xmath77 from the localization operator  @xmath78  ( [ eq : hsplit ] ) .    in order to see more clearly the reason why the general rst dynamics gives rise to such an amplitude scalar  @xmath77 , one first transcribes the integrability condition  ( [ eq : intcond ] ) to the kinetic and localization fields  @xmath79  ( [ eq : hsplit ] ) and thus finds for the hermitian part  @xmath45 of @xmath16 @xmath80-i \\left[{{\\mathcal{l}}}_\\mu , { { \\mathcal{l}}}_\\nu\\right ] =    i{{\\mathcal{f}}}_{\\mu\\nu } \\ ; , \\ ] ] and similarly for the localization field  @xmath46 @xmath81 + i \\left[{{\\mathcal{k}}}_\\mu , { { \\mathcal{l}}}_\\nu\\right ] = 0 \\ ; .\\ ] ] by inspecting the trace of the localization field @xmath82 one finds for the trace  @xmath83 of  @xmath46 the following curl relation from ( [ eq : lherm ] ) : @xmath84 consequently , this vector field  @xmath83 must be a gradient field generated by some scalar ( @xmath85 , say ) @xmath86 here ,  @xmath17 is chosen as the dimension of the typical vector fibre ( i.e.  @xmath0 for two - particle systems , see below ) . the significance of this _ amplitude field _",
    "@xmath77 for the matter dichotomy will readily become evident .",
    "the very general features of rst mentioned up to now are already sufficient in order to conclude that the rst matter emerges in two different forms which are dynamically kept apart : the positive and negative mixtures , being separated by the pure states as a certain kind of borderline configuration . indeed , as will become evident through the following arguments , we even need only the rne  ( [ eq : cali ] ) together with the integrability condition  ( [ eq : intcond])in the form  ( [ eq : curll])-([eq : lscal ] ) in order to establish the desired matter dichotomy .",
    "this will be readily proven explicitly for the lowest - order cases  @xmath87 and from here it becomes evident by means of some inductive arguments that the dichotomy must exist for any fibre dimension  @xmath17 ( which is the minimal number of fibre dimensions necessary for the description of @xmath17 scalar particles ) .",
    "the point of departure is the recursive construction of certain polynomials  @xmath88 of degree  @xmath89 for the intensity matrix  @xmath13 . introducing here the _ deviation densities _  @xmath90 as the trace of the _ deviators _",
    "@xmath88 , i.e. @xmath91 the deviators  @xmath88 are defined through @xmath92 the starting point of the recursion is the lowest - order deviator  @xmath93 which we put identical to the intensity matrix  @xmath13 itself    [ eq : d1 ] @xmath94    then comes the first ( non - trivial ) deviator  @xmath95 @xmath96 correspondingly the second deviator reads  @xmath97 @xmath98 and finally let us mention the third deviator  @xmath99 @xmath100    it should be evident that this recursive construction of deviators becomes trivial when the deviation order  @xmath101 coincides with the fibre dimension  @xmath17 , i.e.  we have @xmath102 thus the last non - trivial deviator for fibre - dimension  @xmath17 is  @xmath103 and the next one vanishes ,  @xmath104 , i.e.  by means of equation  ( [ eq : devi ] ) @xmath105 however , for a regular intensity matrix  @xmath106 this implies for fibre dimension  @xmath17 @xmath107 which is nothing else than the well - known _ hamilton - cayley identity _ of matrix calculus  @xcite .",
    "thus for fibre dimension  @xmath0 we conclude for the  @xmath108-matrix  @xmath13 @xmath109 with the deviation density  @xmath110 being identical to the determinant of the intensity matrix , i.e. @xmath111 similarly for the fibre dimension  @xmath112 one deduces from equation  ( [ eq : d3 ] ) for the  @xmath113-matrix  @xmath13 @xmath114 where the second deviation density  @xmath115 is now the determinant of the intensity matrix  @xmath13 @xmath116 or finally , for fibre dimension  @xmath117 , the closing condition  ( [ eq : dn ] ) yields on account of equation  ( [ eq : d4 ] ) the corresponding hamilton - cayley identity @xmath118 with @xmath119    these few examples ( in place of a rigorous induction scheme ) may be sufficient in order to see the general formalism working well for any fibre dimension  @xmath17 .",
    "it will be used now in order to establish the desired dichotomy effect .",
    "the interesting point with the rst dynamics is now that it subdivides the configuration space of matter ( i.e.  the space of regular  @xmath120-matrices ) into two dynamically separated subsets : the positive and negative mixtures , with the pure states appearing as an asymptotic limit of both kinds of mixtures .",
    "here the criterium of membership refers to the determinant  @xmath121 of the intensity matrix  @xmath13 such that for  @xmath122 one has a `` positive '' ( `` negative '' ) mixture . on the other hand",
    "the pure states are uniquely characterized by the well - known fierz identity  @xcite for the intensity matrix , i.e. @xmath123 which restricts  @xmath13 to the tensor product of some wave function  @xmath14 : @xmath124 indeed , this is easily verified by simply substituting the latter form of  @xmath13 into the definition of the first deviator  @xmath125  ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "for the special case of two fibre dimensions @xmath0 the hamilton - cayley identity  ( [ eq : df ] ) says that the fierz identity upon  @xmath13  ( [ eq : df0 ] ) is even equivalent to the one real condition of vanishing fierz deviation  @xmath126 ( see below for a detailed treatment of the two - particle systems ) .",
    "however , by what circumstance does this dichotomic mixture effect come about ?",
    "the answer comes from the combination of the rne  ( [ eq : cali ] ) with the existence of the amplitude field  @xmath127  ( [ eq : lscal ] ) . here , the first step consists in splitting up the @xmath17-order deviator  @xmath103 into the highest - power term of  @xmath13 and the remainder  @xmath128 : @xmath129 for instance from the definition of the first deviator  @xmath125  ( [ d2 ] ) we obtain @xmath130 or similarly for the second deviator  @xmath131  ( [ eq : d3 ] ) @xmath132 and finally for the third deviator  @xmath133  ( [ eq : d4 ] ) @xmath134 the general procedure should be self - suggesting from these few examples .",
    "in the next step , one considers the derivative of the determinant  @xmath135  ( [ eq : deltan ] ) which is found to consist of two terms according to the splitting  ( [ eq : dny ] ) @xmath136 the first term on the right is due to the derivative of the first term  @xmath137 of the splitting  ( [ eq : dny ] ) when the rne  ( [ eq : cali ] ) has been used and after this that splitting  ( [ eq : dny ] ) is applied again in the opposite direction leading back to  @xmath103 .",
    "however since  @xmath103 is of that simple form  ( [ eq : dn ] ) , namely proportional to the identity  @xmath138 , the derivative of the determinant  @xmath135  ( [ eq : split ] ) becomes @xmath139 provided the second term on the right of  ( [ eq : split ] ) vanishes , i.e. concretely if we have the trace identity @xmath140    but this identity actually does hold , from which one is easily convinced by the above mentioned examples  @xmath141 and the corresponding induction arguments .",
    "indeed , one merely observes for the first term on the left of  ( [ eq : trid ] ) @xmath142 with the trace of  @xmath128 being easily computed by means of the definition of the deviation densities  @xmath135  ( [ eq : deltan ] ) for  @xmath143 .",
    "thus for  @xmath117 , e.g. , one immediately finds from equation  ( [ eq : y4 ] ) @xmath144 on the other hand , the computation of the second term on the left of  ( [ eq : trid ] ) just meets with this result because for the lower - order deviation densities  @xmath145 one also has @xmath146 cf .",
    "( [ eq : split ] ) , and this then validates definitively the trace identity  ( [ eq : trid ] ) .",
    "observe here that the latter relation  ( [ eq : trdnl ] ) , though being seen now to hold for all deviation orders  @xmath101 up to the maximal value  @xmath147 , had to be exploited only for the maximal order  @xmath17 ( in order to yield the desired result  ( [ eq : ddeltan ] ) because the closing relation  ( [ eq : dn ] ) does apply exclusively to this maximal order  @xmath17 !    once the decisive derivative relation  ( [ eq : ddeltan ] ) is now firmly established , the matter dichotomy emerges by simply observing the former gradient property for the location field  @xmath46  ( [ eq : trl])-([eq : lscal ] ) . indeed",
    "the existence of the amplitude field  @xmath77  ( [ eq : lscal ] ) admits to formally integrate the differential equation  ( [ eq : ddeltan ] ) for  @xmath135 to yield @xmath148 thus , at any event  @xmath149 of space - time the determinant of the intensity matrix  @xmath13 has the same sign as at the initial event  @xmath150 provided both events  @xmath149 and  @xmath150 can be connected by some path along which the amplitude field  @xmath77 is a regular scalar .",
    "the conclusion is that whenever the rst dynamics admits a regular solution over some region of space - time , then this field configuration must be either a positive mixture  @xmath151 or a negative mixture  @xmath152 or a `` quasi - pure state ''  @xmath153 .",
    "the latter kind of mixtures are not ordinary pure states ( which have  @xmath154 , see  ( [ eq : df0 ] ) ) but they are not forbidden by the rst dynamics to decay to such an ordinary pure state ( with vanishing deviator  @xmath125 ) ; however the positive and negative mixtures must strictly preserve their mixture character over the whole domain of regularity in space - time ( _ `` matter dichotomy '' _ ) .",
    "when matter appears in two different forms , one clearly wants to see the common features and also the differences . for a study of such questions in the subsequent sections ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the two - particle systems ( @xmath0 ) and we specialize first the general dynamical equations for this situation . here",
    "it is important to parametrize the rst field system in such a way that a clear separation between single - particle variables and exchange fields comes about .",
    "such a conceptual separation of the two field subsystems facilitates afterwards the discussion of the exchange effects occuring between the single - particle subsystems .      as attractive as the covariant equations may look like in their abstract form , for concrete computations one mostly resorts to a special reference system and decomposes the covariant objects with respect to such a reference frame .",
    "the corresponding components of the ( gauge and/or coordinate ) covariant objects are then treated as the proper dynamical objects entering the component form of the abstract dynamical equations . for the present rst operator dynamics ,",
    "one thus chooses first some orthonormal basis for the operators acting over the typical vector fibre @xmath155 of the two - particle systems .",

    "simultaneously , the present method of bundle trivialization demonstrates that the euler class @xmath390 is an element of the _ integral _ cohomology group @xmath421 , since the winding numbers @xmath302 $ ] ( [ e5:4 ] ) must necessarily appear as integers .",

    "the existence of such a metric is guaranteed by the vanishing of the euler number @xmath461 ( [ e5:4 ] ) @xcite ; and its invariance group consists of the @xmath382 tranformations being specified by equation ( [ e5:33 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the positive mixtures are geometrically characterized by a trivial @xmath326 connection @xmath394 ( [ e5:50 ] ) and thus start with a global triad of tangent vectors @xmath462 from the very beginning @xmath463 however such a triad can always be complemented to a tetrad ( by selection of some linearly independent fourth vector ) and then the same arguments do apply as for the negative mixtures .",
    "the geometric difference between both mixtures is that the representative 2-surfaces for the positive mixtures are space - like ( such that the gauge element @xmath355 ( [ e5:33 ] ) acts as an ordinary rotation of the space - like tangent plane of the 2-surfaces ) whereas the negative mixtures have a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional minkowski plane as their tangent space ."

    "<S> within the framework of relativistic schrdinger theory ( an alternative form of quantum mechanics for relativistic many - particle systems ) it is shown that a general n - particle system must occur in one of two forms : either as a `` positive '' or as a `` negative '' mixture , in analogy to the fermion - boson dichotomy of matter in the conventional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the pure states represent a limiting case between the two types of mixtures which themselves are considered as the rst counterparts of the entangled ( fermionic or bosonic ) states of the conventional quantum theory . both kinds of mixtures are kept separated from dynamical as well as from topological reasons . </S>",
    "<S> the 2-particle configurations ( @xmath0 ) are studied in great detail with respect to their geometric and topological properties which are described in terms of the euler class of an appropriate bundle connection . </S>",
    "<S> if the underlying space - time manifold ( as the base space of the fibre bundles applied ) is parallelisable , the 2-particle configurations can be thought to be generated geometrically by an appropriate ( @xmath1 ) splitting of the local tangent space . </S>"
