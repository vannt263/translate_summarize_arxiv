    "in the past two decades , a large amount of literature was devoted to the celebrated camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary constant , which models the unidirectional propagation of shallow water waves over a flat bottom . here",
    "@xmath2 stands for the fluid velocity at time @xmath3 in the spatial @xmath4 direction @xcite .",
    "ch is also a model for the propagation of axially symmetric waves in hyperelastic rods @xcite .",
    "it has a bi - hamiltonian structure and is completely integrable @xcite .",
    "also there is a geometric interpretation of ch in terms of geodesic flow on the diffeomorphism group of the circle @xcite .",
    "its solitary waves are peaked @xcite .",
    "they are orbitally stable and interact like solitons @xcite .",
    "it is also worth pointing out the peaked solitary waves replicate a feature that is characteristic for the waves of great height - waves of largest amplitude that are exact solutions of the governing equations for water waves , cf .",
    "the discussion in the papers @xcite .",
    "the cauchy problem and initial boundary value problem for ch have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this equation is locally well - posed @xcite for initial data @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , it has global strong solutions @xcite and also finite time blow - up solutions @xcite . on the other hand , it has global weak solutions in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of ch in comparison with the kdv equation lies in the fact that ch has peaked solitons and models wave breaking @xcite ( by wave breaking we understand that the wave remains bounded while its slope becomes unbounded in finite time @xcite ) .",
    "another important integrable equation admitting peaked soliton ( peakon ) is the famous degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equation @xcite @xmath8 which is regarded as a model for nonlinear shallow water dynamics @xcite .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the dp equation has a bi - hamiltonian structure and an infinite number of conservation laws , and admits exact peakon solutions which are analogous to the ch peakons .",
    "the cauchy problem and initial boundary value problem for dp have been studied extensively in @xcite .",
    "although dp is very similar to ch in many aspects , especially in the structure of equation , there are some essential differences between the two equations .",
    "one of the famous features of dp equation is that it has not only ( periodic ) peakon solutions @xcite , but also ( periodic ) shock peakons @xcite .",
    "besides , ch is a re - expression of geodesic flow on the diffeomorphism group @xcite , while the dp equation can be regarded as a non - metric euler equation @xcite .",
    "note that the nonlinear terms in the ch and dp equations are both quadratic .",
    "indeed , there exist integrable systems admitting peakons and nonlinear cubic terms , which are the modified ch equation @xmath9 with a constant @xmath1 , and the novikov equation @xmath10 eq.(1.1 ) was proposed independently in @xcite .",
    "the lax pair and cusped soliton ( cuspon ) solutions for eq.(1.1 ) have been studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , the formation of singularities for eq.(1.1 ) , a wave - breaking mechanism and the peakon stability of eq.(1.1 ) in the case of @xmath11 were investigated in @xcite . the novikov equation was proposed in @xcite and its lax pair , bi - hamiltonian structure , peakon solutions , well - posedness , blow - up phenomena and global weak solutions have been studied extensively in @xcite . very recently ,",
    "the following integrable equation with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearity @xmath12 was investigated , where @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are three arbitrary constants .",
    "eq.(1.2 ) was first proposed by fokas in @xcite .",
    "its lax pair , bi - hamiltonian structure , peakons , weak kinks , kink - peakon interactional , and smooth soliton solutions were studied recently in @xcite .",
    "a natural idea is to extend such study to the multi - component generalized systems .",
    "one of the most popular is the following integrable two - component camassa - holm shallow water system ( 2ch ) @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath13 and @xmath17 , which becomes ch equation when @xmath18 .",
    "the cauchy problems of ( 2ch ) with @xmath19 and with @xmath20 have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "local well - posedness for ( 2ch ) with the initial data in sobolev spaces and in besov spaces have been established in @xcite .",
    "the blow - up phenomena and global existence of strong solutions to ( 2ch ) in sobolev spaces have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the analyticity of solutions to the cauchy problem for ( 2ch ) and the initial boundary value problem for ( 2ch ) have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , the existence of global weak solutions for ( 2ch ) with @xmath20 has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "another two famous systems are the modified two - component camassa - holm system ( m2ch ) @xcite : @xmath21 with @xmath13 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the two - component degasperis - procesi system ( 2dp ) @xcite : @xmath24 with @xmath13 and a real constant @xmath1 . when @xmath18 , ( m2ch ) and ( 2dp ) are reduced to ch and dp equations , respectively .",
    "the cauchy problems and initial boundary value problems for ( m2ch ) and ( 2dp ) have been studied in many works , for example @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is noted to point out that the nonlinear terms in above three two - component systems are all quadratic .    in this paper , we consider the following integrable two - component system with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearity proposed in @xcite : @xmath25_x-\\frac{1}{2}(uv_x - u_x v)m+bu_x=0,\\\\ n_t+\\frac{1}{2}[(uv - u_x v_x)n]_x+\\frac{1}{2}(uv_x - u_x v)n+bv_x=0 , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath26 , and @xmath1 takes an arbitrary value . system ( 1.3 ) is reduced to the ch equation , the modified cubic ch equation eq.(1.1 ) , and the generalized ch equation eq.(1.2 ) as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "integrability of this system , its bi - hamiltonian structure , and infinitely many conservation laws were already presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition , this system is the first two - component system admitting weak kink solutions .",
    "let us set up the cauchy problem for the above system as follows : @xmath30 by using the same approach in @xcite , the analytic solutions to system ( [ mn ] ) can be readily proved in both variables , globally in space and locally in time .",
    "however , the goal of this paper is to establish the local well - posedness regime for the cauchy problem in besov spaces , present the precise blow - up scenario and a new blow - up result for strong solutions to the system , and derive the peakon and weak kink solutions .    with regard to the locally well - posed problem",
    ", we first apply the classical kato semigroup theory to obtain the local well - posedness for system ( [ mn ] ) with initial data @xmath31 belonging in sobolev space @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "subsequently , we take advantage of the transport equation theory , littlewood - paley s decomposition and some fine estimates of besov spaces to establish the local well - posedness for system ( [ mn ] ) in besov spaces ( see theorem 3.2 below ) , which particularly implies the system is locally well - posed with initial data @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "this almost improves the corresponding result by using kato s semigroup approach .    in order to investigate the blow - up phenomena , we here make good use of the fine structure of system ( [ mn ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that system ( [ mn ] ) possesses the following two conservation laws : @xmath36 @xmath37 indeed , as mentioned before , this system has infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "but , unfortunately , one can not seem to seek and then utilize some of them to control the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 directly . while it is very important to bound them in studying the blow - up phenomena of system ( [ mn ] ) .",
    "this difficulty has been overcome in some sense by exploiting the characteristic ode related to system ( [ mn ] ) to establish some invariant properties of the solutions and making good use of the structure of the system itself ( we here need to treat two cross terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the system ) , see lemma 4.2 below . it is noted to point out that , for the special case eq.(1.1 ) as @xmath11 , with the conserved quantity @xmath42 in hand , one can directly control @xmath38 by using sobolev s embedding theorem , that is , @xmath43 , for all @xmath44 . and",
    "thus the blow - up phenomena of eq.(1.1 ) with @xmath11 has been studied in @xcite . on the other hand , in view of the uselessness of the conservation laws of system ( [ mn ] ) again ( mainly because the regularity is not high enough ) , we directly investigate the transport equation in terms of the flow @xmath45 which is the slope of @xmath46 ( see lemma 4.3 below ) to derive a new blow - up result with respect to initial data ( see theorem 4.3 below ) .",
    "overall , we havent used any conservation laws rather than the almost symmetrical structure of system ( [ mn ] ) in the whole paper .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will recall some facts on the littlewood - paley decomposition , the nonhomogeneous besov spaces and their some useful properties , and the transport equation theory as well . in section 3 ,",
    "we establish the local well - posedness of system ( [ mn ] ) . in section 4",
    ", we derive the precise blow - up scenario and a new blow - up result of strong solutions to system ( [ mn ] ) .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussing peakon and weak kink solutions .",
