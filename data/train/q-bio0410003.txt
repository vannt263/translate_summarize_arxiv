    "in an organism , genes can be turned on or off by the binding of proteins to regulatory sites on the dna in the vicinity of the starting point for transcription @xcite .",
    "the proteins are known as transcription factors and the dna binding sites are known as operators .",
    "the process is an example of gene regulation .",
    "transcription factors can turn genes off by stereochemical blockage of the binding of rna polymerase ( rnap ) , or they can turn genes on by co - operative binding ( recruitment ) of rnap @xcite .    since transcription factors are proteins , they are coded for elsewhere on the genome .",
    "this means that transcription factors can regulate the production of other transcription factors , or indeed can regulate their own production .",
    "a highly complex network of biochemical reactions can be built up , capable , in principle , of solving arbitrarily complex computational problems @xcite .",
    "the network is interfaced to the outside world by , e.g. , signalling cascades from receptor proteins or by specific interactions between transcription factors and small molecules such as metabolites . in this way , even relatively simple organisms such as _ e. coli _  can perform fairly complex computations such as integrating different environmental signals . in higher organisms ,",
    "gene regulation networks lie at the heart of cell differentiation and developmental pathways .",
    "genetic toggle switches are an informative paradigm in this context @xcite .",
    "they are regulatory constructs which select between two possible stable states , representing for example differentiation between two developmental pathways .",
    "perhaps the simplest kind of switch is one that is constructed from a pair of genes that mutually repress each other , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : switch ] .",
    "the switch of @xmath5-phage  in _ e. coli _  is a naturally occuring example , which has been studied in much detail @xcite .",
    "another well - known example is that of the human herpesvirus 3 ( chickenpox or varicella - zoster virus ) , which has a pathogenesis that is remarkably similar to @xmath5-phage ; the virus lies dormant after the initial infection , but can be triggered to re - emerge much later as shingles ( herpes zoster ) .",
    "synthetic toggle switches have also been constructed _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite .",
    "genetic switches are usually flipped by external signals . in the @xmath5-phage  , for example , the switch is initially in the dormant ( lysogenic ) state but can be flipped into the active ( lytic ) state by the presence of the bacterial protein reca .",
    "such an induction event occurs when the cell starts to produce reca to repair dna damage as a result of , e.g. , a burst of uv light .    ]",
    "importantly , genetic switches are often so stable that they remain in one state until the external trigger flips the switch . in wild - type @xmath5-phage",
    "spontaneous flips are extremely rare , occurring at a rate of perhaps as low as one spontaneous flip in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "an important question , therefore , is : what are the design principles that allow the switch to attain such extreme stability in the presence of fluctuations and biochemical noise ?",
    "this question is particularly relevant , because detailed modelling has suggested that the stability of @xmath5-phage  can not be explained on the basis of our current understanding @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that mutual exclusion of competing transcription factors can drastically enhance the stability of genetic switches @xcite .",
    "transcription factors can mutually exclude each other , if their operator sites ( partially ) overlap ( see fig .  [ fig : switch]b ) .",
    "it appears that nature has exploited the functional benefit of this spatial arrangement of operators , since a recent statistical analysis has revealed that this network motif of ` overlapping operons ' is over - represented in the bacterium _",
    "e. coli_@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend the analysis of ref . in several ways @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we first describe the set of chemical reactions by which we model the genetic toggle switches ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : switch ] ) .",
    "we then turn to a mean - field ( chemical rate equation ) analysis of the appearance of switching behaviour .",
    "this mean - field analysis shows that the region of bistability is significantly larger for the exclusive switch than for the general switch . in order to determine the life times of the stable steady states of the switches ,",
    "we have performed direct stochastic simulations ; these are described in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "we then consider a number of refinements of the basic switch model .",
    "in particular , we explicitly take into account transcription and translation .",
    "we show that both ` shot noise ' and fluctuations in the number of proteins produced per mrna transcript markedly decrease the switch stability .",
    "however , we again find that the exclusive switch is still orders of magnitude more stable than the general switch . in this paper",
    ", we also elucidate the origin of the enhanced stability of the exclusive switch with respect to that of the general switch : while the kinetic prefactor is roughly the same for both switches , the ` free - energy ' barrier for flipping is significantly higher for the exclusive switch than for the general switch @xcite .",
    "this underscores our earlier observation that mutual exclusion can drastically enhance the robustness of genetic switches to biochemical noise @xcite .",
    "it also strongly supports the conjecture that regulatory control is one of the main evolutionary driving forces that shape the organisation of genes and operons on the genome @xcite .",
    "our starting point is a set of chemical reactions which model the processes involved in the toggle switches shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : switch ] . as chemical species ,",
    "we introduce a pair of transcription factors ( tfs ) which can exist as monomers , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , or multimers , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the multimers are responsible for regulating gene expression and are allowed to bind to the genome at an operator site .",
    "multimers are introduced in order to get sufficient co - operativity in the binding isotherms to make a genetic switch @xcite , as described in more detail below .",
    "the state of the operator is represented by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , _ etc _ , depending on the state of binding of the multimers .",
    "the chemical reactions are    [ chemeqs ] @xmath13    here we have adopted a condensed notation in which ` @xmath14 ' indicates alternative sets of reactants and ` @xmath15 ' indicates that the reactants are not destroyed by the reaction . for example the first of eqs .",
    ", @xmath16 , represents two reactions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    the reactions in eqs .",
    "account for , respectively , the formation of multimers , the binding of tf multimers to the operator ( eqs .   and ) , the expression of tf monomers , and the degradation of tf monomers .",
    "repression of gene expression is implicit in eqs .",
    ", thus @xmath7 is expressed if and only if @xmath10 is not bound , _",
    "etc_. reaction rates are as indicated , and we define equilibrium constants for multimerisation , @xmath19 , and operator binding , @xmath20 .    whilst detailed and biologically faithful models can be constructed as has been done for the @xmath5-phage  switch @xcite , the above model is intentionally as simple as possible .",
    "we believe that such an approach is as important as detailed biological modelling in elucidating the basic physical principles behind switches .",
    "thus , for example , we have condensed the details of transcription and translation into a single reaction step in eqs .  , governed by rate coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in a later section",
    "we explore the possibility of refining the model at this point",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that the design of the network has to obey certain constraints . in particular , the tfs must bind co - operatively to the dna in order to make a working switch @xcite . in the present model ,",
    "co - operativity is introduced through the binding of tf multimers rather than monomers .",
    ".distinct possibilities for the subsets of operator states for our switch model : ` 0 ' indicates the state is disallowed , ` 1 ' indicates it is allowed.[tab : poss ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ tab : barrier ] shows the barrier heights @xmath23 computed from the direct numerical simulations of @xmath24 .",
    "we can now obtain the kinetic prefactor @xmath25 by dividing the rate constant @xmath26 by @xmath27 : @xmath28 ( see also eq .",
    "[ eq : por ] ) .",
    "we find that the underlying barrier - crossing rate @xmath29 is a ( small ) fraction of @xmath30 , which corresponds to the time scale for gene expression ( see table [ tab : rates ] ) .",
    "in fact , for the general switch , the kinetic prefactor @xmath25 is significantly lower than the slowest reaction in the system , which is the degradation reaction with @xmath31 ( see also table [ tab : rates ] ) . since @xmath25 can be interpreted as the rate at which the barrier is crossed ( i.e. , the flux of trajectories at the top of the barrier ) , it is clear that crossing the barrier typically involves a large number of protein synthesis and degradation steps .",
    "we have also directly computed from the gillespie trajectories the distribution of escape times from the dividing surface @xmath32 to states with @xmath33 .",
    "we find that for both kinds of switches , the escape time distribution is quite well approximated by a poisson distribution with a characteristic lifetime @xmath34 .",
    "since the switches are symmetric , this means we can define the escape rate to one side ( for example to @xmath35 ) to be @xmath36 .",
    "estimates for @xmath37 from the poisson - distribution fit are shown in the fourth column in table  [ tab : barrier ] .",
    "the ratio of the barrier crossing rate to the one - sided escape rate is the transmission coefficient , @xmath38 @xcite . as table  [ tab : barrier ] shows , the transmission coefficient for both kinds of switch is 1020% .",
    "this shows that the barrier crossing is quite diffusive .",
    "in other words , a typical transition path between the two stable regions crosses and re - crosses the top of the barrier @xmath32 several times before committing to one of the stable basins .",
    "this is in accord with our findings on the statistics of @xmath39 crossing times reported previously @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the observation that a typical transition path involves many protein synthesis and degradation reactions .",
    "we now consider the effects of varying parameters away from the baseline set , and changing some other aspects such as introducing a more detailed representation of transcription and translation .",
    "switch stability is generally unaffected by variation of the kinetic rates that do not alter the mean copy number of the tfs .",
    "what does have an effect , as we shall see , are phenomena which increase the ` shot noise ' in expression .",
    "these include the generation of multiple copies of the tf from each mrna transcript and stochastic fluctuations in the number of copies of the tf generated per mrna transcript .    in this section",
    "we give results for the dimerising exclusive switch .",
    "we have repeated all the simulations for the dimerising general switch and we find that the same trends are recovered .",
    "we also find that the exclusive switch is _ always _ markedly more stable than the corresponding general switch , in a manner represented by fig .",

    "the solid line is the fit to the baseline data from fig .",
    "[ fig : taunum].[fig : varied ] ]      fig .",
    "[ fig : varied ] shows that the switch lifetime is very insensitive to variations away from the baseline kinetic parameters that do not affect the mean field steady states .",
    "if , however , we vary the kinetic parameters such that the mean field steady states are changed , then we do see a systematic change in the switch stability .",
    "for instance , the switch stability is enhanced if the binding equilibrium is moved in favour of bound tf by increasing @xmath42 ( the rate of binding to dna ) .",
    "this is because the number of molecules of each tf at the point where switching just starts decreases as @xmath47 increases ( see eq .  ) , and thus at fixed @xmath1 we are effectively moving deeper into the bistable region .",
    "this leads to a more stable switch .",
    "we have condensed the various steps in gene expression into a single ` expression reaction ' in eqs .  .",
    "in reality , however , many steps are involved .",
    "we now analyse these steps in more detail . recall that the genetic information is first _",
    "transcribed _ into messenger rna ( mrna ) , then _ translated _ into proteins by ribosomes .",
    "it is often the case that several copies of the protein can be generated from one mrna transcript . in the simplest way",
    ", we can capture this by replacing eqs .   by a version in which @xmath48 copies of each transcription factor are generated from each mrna transcript ,",
    "thus @xmath49 it is easy to see that nothing changes in mean field theory provided that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are used in place of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we have undertaken simulations for the case @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which in mean field theory is identical to our baseline .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ fig : messenger ] shows , the switch lifetime is decreased as a result of having tfs generated two at a time .",
    "the basic reason is that the ` shot noise ' in the expression reactions has increased .     in eq .  .",
    "in a model which includes explicit mrna production ( as described by eqs .  ) , then even if on average only one tf is produced per transcript , the stability is similarly degraded by fluctuations about the mean .",
    "` baseline ' refers to the baseline model , as described in table  [ tab : rates ] .",
    "[ fig : messenger ] ]    even if on average one tf is produced from each mrna transcript , noise can arise from the fluctuations about this mean , as we now discuss . to capture this",
    ", we explicitly include the generation and degradation of mrna for the two tfs in the list of chemical reactions .",
    "the expression reactions in eq .   are replaced by the following reactions :    [ extreqs ] @xmath54    in these , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mrna species , and the reactions represent the generation and degradation of mrna , and the translation of mrna into tfs .",
    "we have introduced new rate coefficients for the translation , transcription and mrna degradation steps .    in a steady state in mean field theory , the rate of transcription balances the rate of mrna degradation and the mean number of mrna transcripts is @xmath57 .",
    "each transcript produces tfs at a rate @xmath58 , hence the overall rate of production of tf is @xmath59 . we conclude that the equivalent expression rate is @xmath60 going beyond mean field theory , the statistics of this basic model for mrna translation can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "translation occurs at a rate @xmath58 and degradation at a rate @xmath61 , hence the probability per unit time of either a translation or a degradation event taking place is @xmath62 .",
    "given that an event has taken place , the probability that it was a translation event is @xmath63 and the probability that it was a degradation event is @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the probability that @xmath48 copies of the protein are generated before the mrna transcript is degraded is @xmath65 . from this , all the statistics can be calculated .",
    "for instance , the mean number of tfs produced per transcript is @xmath66 , which agrees with the expectation from eq .  .",
    "also @xmath67 , so that the standard deviation divided by the mean is @xmath68 .",
    "thus there is considerable noise due to fluctuations in the number of proteins generated per transcript , and this noise is largest when the mean number of tfs produced per transcript is small .    to see the effect of this noise we have implemented the additional reactions in eqs .   in our reaction schemes and again determined the switch lifetimes by direct simulation .",
    "[ fig : messenger ] shows the results for @xmath69 . for these parameter values @xmath70 and , according to eq .",
    ", such a system should be identical to our baseline .",
    "moreover since @xmath71 , there is on average one tf produced per mrna transcript , so the ` shot noise ' associated with the mean number of tfs produced per transcript is the same as in the baseline model .",
    "however , the simulations clearly demonstrate that the additional noise due to fluctuations about this mean reduces the switch lifetime considerably .      as a second refinement to the model for gene transcription and translation ,",
    "we now consider gene expression as a multistep process .",
    "we thus replace the single reaction @xmath17 by a sequence of reaction steps @xmath72 if there is only one intermediate stage , @xmath73 say , this can be used to model the formation of an ` open complex ' @xcite .",
    "if there are multiple intermediate stages , this could represent the individual steps of the rna polymerase that walks along the dna , or those of the ribosomes that walk along the mrna . in some of the more detailed models of gene expression ,",
    "all these intermediate steps are captured in detail @xcite .",
    "we can make a connection with the baseline model by computing the waiting time for the lumped reaction @xmath17 . since the waiting times for the individual steps in eq .",
    "are independent statistical quantities , the waiting time for the whole sequence is the sum of the waiting times for the individual steps . in terms of reaction rates , @xmath74 , where @xmath30 is the rate of the lumped reaction , and the @xmath75 are the rates of the intermediate steps .",
    "it follows that the waiting time distribution for the lumped reaction is not a poisson distribution .",
    "indeed the central limit theorem indicates that the lumped reaction will tend to have a gaussian distribution of waiting times , effectively converging on a @xmath76-function for a very large number of steps .",
    "thus the approximation which replaces eq .   by @xmath17",
    "amounts to replacing the true non - poisson distribution of waiting times by a poisson distribution with the same mean .",
    "we have tested the consequences of this assumption for two cases . in the first test , we have inserted a single intermediate stage in eq .   to represent the formation of the open complex .",
    "the rates of the two steps were chosen to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 , so that formation of the open complex is the slow step . with this choice",
    ", the rate for the lumped reaction is the same as the baseline model . in the second test , we have inserted four intermediate stages in the reaction scheme , so that there are five intermediate reaction steps between @xmath11 and @xmath79 , to model for example the progressive stages of transcription .",
    "we have chosen the rates of these intermediate steps all equal to @xmath78 so again the effective rate for the lumped reaction is the same as the baseline model .",
    "however , the sum of the variances for the individual steps is now five times smaller than the variance in the waiting time for the lumped reaction .",
    "[ fig : activesplit ] shows data for the dimerising exclusive switch with these modifications .",
    "it shows that the switch stability is practically unaffected by the inclusion of the additional reaction steps .",
    "these results suggest that the precise waiting time statistics for these multistep reactions are less important for the switch stability than the statistics of the number fluctuations ( as studied in considerable detail in the preceeding section ) .",
    "this is perhaps not so surprising , since the activation process to flip the switch must proceed by multiple coincidences of the ` right ' expression or degradation events ( see also discussion on kinetic prefactor @xmath25 in section  [ sec : rates ] ) , and so the detailed waiting time statistics of the individual reaction steps are unimportant .    ) , there is practically no effect on switch stability when one activation step is included ( right triangles ) or several are included ( left triangles ) as in eq .",
    "( see main text for details ) .",
    "there is also little change if the operator is ` split ' as in fig .",
    "[ fig : split ] and eqs .",
    "( diamonds ) .",
    "the line is the fit to the baseline data from fig .",
    "[ fig : taunum].[fig : activesplit ] ]      the basic premise of the exclusive switch is that the binding of one tf excludes the binding of the other tf . whilst it is natural to think of this in terms of a diverging pair of genes on opposite strands of the dna as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : switch](b ) , it is also possible to achieve the same effect by having each tf prevent the binding of the other tf at separated operators on the dna .",
    "an exclusive switch with such a ` split ' arrangement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : split ] .",
    "this arrangement is interesting because for each gene , one tf regulates expression by acting as a repressor , but the other tf acts only indirectly by preventing binding of the repressor tf .     ]",
    "we can set up a system of chemical reactions to model the split operator case as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the operator sites for the genes which code for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "then the set of reactions is    [ spliteqs ] @xmath82    plus the multimerisation and degradation reactions from eqs .  .",
    "we assume that the rates for all binding and unbinding reactions are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and those for expression of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "this set of reactions describes the split analogue of the exclusive switch . in mean field theory ,",
    "this model is identical to the standard case .",
    "we have simulated this model and indeed find that there is little alteration to the switch stability , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : activesplit ] .",
    "we conclude that it is the exclusive nature of the tf binding which makes the exclusive switch markedly more stable than the general case .",
    "this can be achieved by overlapping the operator sites of genes that are arranged in a divergent manner and ( thus ) on opposite strands of the dna as in fig .",
    "[ fig : switch](b ) , or by the pure exclusive binding arrangements of fig .",
    "[ fig : split ] .",
    "it appears , however , that nature has taken advantage of the elegance of the former scenario : in _ e. coli _",
    "there are a significantly large number of diverging gene pairs with overlapping operator sites @xcite .",
    "a genetic switch is inherently stochastic , because of the molecular character of its components .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that the stability of a genetic switch can be strongly influenced by its construction .",
    "if the competing transcription factors mutually exclude each other at the operator regions , then the switch stability is markedly enhanced .",
    "mutual exclusion of competing regulatory molecules can be obtained by overlapping operons , a network motif that we have recently identified in a statistical analysis of the gene regulatory network of _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite .",
    "the basic conclusion that mutual exclusion of competing regulatory molecules can strongly enhance the stability of biochemical networks is robust .",
    "nevertheless , the switch stability is influenced by phenomena that increase the noise in gene expression .",
    "such phenomena include the generation of multiple copies of a transcription factor from the same mrna transcript , as well as intrinsic noise arising from the fluctuations in the numbers of proteins produced from a transcript .",
    "when expressed as a function of the number of molecules involved in switching , the switch stability is characterised by a well defined lifetime @xmath0 which grows exponentially with the mean number , @xmath1 , of the transcription factors that are involved in the switching . in the regime",
    "accessible to direct numerical simulations , the growth law is well characterised by @xmath2 , where and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are parameters .    whereas we have investigated a number of details that might affect switch stability ,",
    "we have left out some considerations which might additionally be important .",
    "foremost amongst these is the influence of cell division and the cell cycle .",
    "other effects such as fluctuations in the availability of rna polymerase and ribosomes might also have an influence on switch stability .",
    "another aspect that should be investigated is the response of the switch to a perturbation , in other words how one might toggle a switch by introducing a pulse of some kind .",
    "we leave all these questions to future work .",
    "the rapid increase of the switch stability with the number of expressed transcription factors presents a fundamental limitation to the use of direct simulation to compute the switch lifetime .",
    "this provokes the question : is there a smarter way to compute the switch stability for long - lived switches ?",
    "such simulation methods would generically be useful since the characterisation of rare events remains a key challenge in computational systems biology @xcite . in the field of soft - condensed matter physics , numerical techniques , such as the reactive flux method  @xcite and transition path sampling  @xcite ,",
    "have been developed that make it possible to simulate rare events such as crystal nucleation , protein folding and chemical reactions .",
    "biochemical networks , however , differ fundamentally from these problems . in the former problems , the stationary distribution of states",
    "is usually known beforehand .",
    "indeed , these systems typically obey detailed balance .",
    "in contrast , our genetic circuits , like most biochemical networks , do not satisfy detailed balance .",
    "this means that the stationary distribution of states is not known _ a priori_. as a result , numerical techniques developed to tackle rare events in the field of soft - condensed matter physics , can not straightforwardly be transposed to biochemical networks .",
    "recently , we have developed a new numerical technique , called forward flux sampling  @xcite , that does not rely upon prior knowledge of the stationary distribution of states .",
    "the scheme is easily applicable to a wide variety of biochemical switches , such as that of bacteriophage lambda , and makes it possible to calculate rates of switching and to identify patwhays for switching .",
    "the technique should therefore lead to a better understanding of these rare , but important events in biology .",
