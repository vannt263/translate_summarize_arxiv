    "star formation regions are generally studied at long wavelengths . molecular clouds cool by far infrared emission of dust and",
    "rotational lines such as the @xmath7 line of co. young stellar clusters ( yscs ) are investigated directly at optical and near - infrared wavelengths if they are relatively unobscured , and at mid- to far - infrared if they are deeply embedded so that their starlight is reprocessed by heated dust .",
    "gas in hii regions heated by massive stars can be studied at radio through ultraviolet wavelengths , but give limited information about the full stellar population .",
    "it may seem at first that x - ray observations would make only very limited contributions to star formation and ysc studies .",
    "lower mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars typically emit only @xmath8 of their bolometric radiation in the x - ray band @xcite , and the ratio is even smaller for ob stars where @xmath9 . yet , modern x - ray telescopes such as the @xmath0 @xmath10 @xmath11 and the @xmath12 satellite are surprisingly sensitive . for a @xmath0 exposure of 100 ks ,",
    "a single pms star with @xmath13 l@xmath6 can be detected with 10 photons out to 2 kpc and an o star with @xmath14 l@xmath6 can be detected out to 6 kpc , assuming little absorption .",
    "a compact massive ysc with an initial mass function ( imf ) extending from early - o stars through brown dwarfs will typically emit @xmath15 l@xmath6 in the hard x - ray band which can be detected through most of the galactic disk .",
    "obscuration by the natal molecular cloud and , for distant star forming regions , intervening spiral arms , presents the major difficulty at all wavelengths for studying star formation on a galactic scale .",
    "x - ray astronomy can help because a significant fraction of the x - ray photons from both low and high mass stars are emitted at energies above 3 kev which can penetrate through nearly all lines - of - sight in the galaxy and deep into molecular clouds .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 orion ultradeep project ( coup ) discussed here , the protostar irs  2 in the omc-1 south molecular core was detected with 30 cts/(100  ks ) with an x - ray - derived line - of - sight column density @xmath16 @xmath17 equivalent to @xmath18 mag @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of young stars in star formation regions provide a variety of insights that complement those obtained at longer wavelengths .",
    "these include :    1 .",
    "x - ray images give a census of members of yscs that is largely independent of the presence or absence of a dusty circumstellar disk , thereby overcoming the bias of memberships derived from infrared - excess criteria @xcite .",
    "sufficiently deep x - ray images can peer into the lower mass population in yscs where only the ob stars have been studied .",
    "due to a statistical correlation between x - ray luminosity and mass @xcite , the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) might be useful to test uniformity of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in different clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the monotonic decrease of @xmath19 in x - ray emission between young stars with ages @xmath20 yr  from the younger orion stars into the main sequence @xcite and continuing to the oldest disk stars @xcite  can greatly assist the removal of contaminants from a ysc membership census .",
    "the shape of the stellar xlf in yscs appears to be universal , and can probably be used as a standard candle for distance determinations @xcite .",
    "the distances to yscs which are too poor or obscured to exhibit a clear ob main sequence are often very uncertain .",
    "3 .   high - resolution x - ray imagery can detect bolometrically faint stars in the close vicinity of bolometrically bright stars , because the contrast in x - ray brightnesses is often small @xcite .",
    "for example , a short @xmath0 observation discovered four companions within 10 of a @xmath21 pms star @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of yscs with well - characterized individual stars permit study of magnetic activity of pms stars as a function of mass , rotation and age @xcite .",
    "x - ray flares give particularly important insight into high energy inputs into protoplanetary disks ; for example , x - ray ionization appears likely to induce magnetodynamical turbulence and mev flare particles may produce isotopic anomalies in disk solids @xcite .",
    "5 .   the x - ray spectrum gives a measure of the intervening total ( i.e. solid and gaseous molecular , atomic , and partially ionized ) interstellar column density that is derived independently of the usual optical - infrared dust extinction curve .",
    "the comparison of @xmath22 derived from soft x - ray absorption and @xmath23 derived from optical - infrared photometry thus allows study of the gas - to - dust ratio in molecular clouds and related issues such as interstellar metallicities and depletions onto grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of high - mass o stars elucidate shocks that thermalize the powerful kinetic energy of their winds .",
    "these include small - scale shocks in the radiatively accelerated zone near the stellar surface ( lucy & white 1980 ) , intermediate - scale shocks arising from magnetic collimation of the wind @xcite , and parsec - scale shocks when winds collide in rich cluster environments @xcite .",
    "colliding winds from close o star or wolf - rayet binaries also produce intense penetrating x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "7 .   by tracing both shocked ob",
    "wind flows and supernova remnant ejection in massive star formation complexes , x - ray images have the potential to help understand these important paths of energy input and chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium , providing a foundation for studies of starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to facilitate advances in these areas , the present paper has two related goals .",
    "first , we establish the global x - ray properties of the nearest rich ysc : the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , and its star formation environment .",
    "the onc is the only rich cluster with sufficient complementary optical and near - infrared ( onir ) data to clearly define the x - ray properties across the imf .",
    "second , we characterize the orion nebula as a template for understanding less sensitive x - ray observations of more distant yscs . the @xmath0 and @xmath12 satellites have observed over two dozen yscs and star formation regions at distances ranging from 0.1 to 10 kpc during their first five years .",
    "our study is based on the deepest x - ray observation of the orion nebula nicknamed the @xmath0 orion ultradeep project ( coup ) , a nearly - continuous 9.7 day exposure of the nebula obtained in january 2003 . @xcite",
    "give a detailed description of the observation , data reduction , spectral analysis , source lists and characteristics .",
    "most of the data analysis is performed using the _ acis extract _",
    "software package .",
    "we also rely heavily on the coup membership study by @xcite and analysis of the unobscured optical sample of the onc described by @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to these studies for background on the sample selection and data analysis procedures .",
    "a distance of 450 pc to the orion nebula is assumed throughout these studies .",
    "we define here a hierarchy of x - ray emitting samples in the orion nebula based on the analyses and tables of @xcite .",
    "these samples are not a complete census of the orion nebula stellar population because many onir members are undetected by coup ( e.g. , tables 11 - 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are omitted .",
    "the missing stars are mainly very low mass ( @xmath24 m@xmath6 ) stars and brown dwarfs , and some deeply obscured stars .",
    "orion nebula member sample : :    these are the 1408 coup sources which , to the best of our knowledge ,    constitute all coup sources associated with the orion nebula star    forming region .",
    "this is the full 1616 coup sample omitting 208 sources    found by @xcite to be probable non - members : 159 sources without    stellar counterparts classified as ` eg ' ( extragalactic sources ) , 16    sources with unobscured stellar counterparts classified as ` field '    ( foreground stars ) , and 33 very faint sources without counterparts    classified as ` unc ' ( source existence is uncertain ) .",
    "forty - two sources    classified as ` omc ' and 33 sources classified as ` omc or eg ? '",
    "are    considered to be obscured members of the orion molecular cloud .",
    "this    can be considered a complete flux limited sample of orion nebula stars    in the @xmath0 @xmath25 kev band .",
    "hot and cool star subsamples : :    we divide the orion nebula members into a small group of 10 unobscured    hot stars with spectral types earlier than b4 ( b3 to o7 ) , and a large    group of 1380 sources cooler than b4 . the 10 hot ` trapezium ' sources    ( coup 349 , 745 , 766 , 778 , 809 , 869 , 1116 , 1232 , 1360 , and 1468 ) are    those where the x - ray emission is likely dominated by stellar wind    shock processes , although contributions by magnetically active cool    companions are sometimes present @xcite .",
    "note that there are a    handful of heavily obscured hot stars in the omc-1 , such as the    becklin - neugebauer object ( coup 599b ) and source i ( coup 590 ) , which    may have spectral type earlier than b4 @xcite . because these stars    have not been well - characterized yet , we group them with the cool star    subsample .",
    "lightly and heavily obscured subsamples : :    our lightly obscured subsample consists of 839 cool ( spectral type    later than b4 ) coup sources of which 822 have absorbing column    densities @xmath26 @xmath17 derived from _ xspec _",
    "spectral fits    @xcite .",
    "seventeen sources which are too faint for spectral fitting    with median energies @xmath27 kev are added based on    the strong correlation between @xmath28 and    @xmath29 (  [ absorb.sec ] ) .",
    "this sample is a superset of the    well - characterized ` optical sample ' and ` lightly absorbed optical    sample ' studied by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the obscured    sample has 559 sources , 541 with @xmath30 @xmath17 derived from _",
    "xspec _ fits and 18    faint sources with @xmath31 kev .",
    "two groups of    these sources associated with the bn / kl and omc 1-south cloud cores    are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the coup x - ray survey has strengths and weaknesses complementary to onir samples .",
    "it does not suffer confusion from the bright inhomogeneous nebular emission , it is virtually complete over the imf down to @xmath32 m@xmath6 , and it has a greater ability to detect lower mass stars at high obscuration",
    ". however , much of the @xmath33 m@xmath6 population is missed @xcite and the sensitivity within @xmath34 of @xmath4 ori c is reduced due to contamination by the point spread function wings of this extremely x - ray - bright star .",
    "we recapitulate the discussion in   9 of @xcite on the reliability and utility of different coup x - ray luminosity estimates .",
    "five x - ray luminosities are considered here : observed @xmath35 in the soft ( @xmath2 kev ) band , observed @xmath36 in the hard ( @xmath1 kev ) band , intrinsic @xmath37 corrected for x - ray absorption , observed @xmath38 in the total ( @xmath25 kev ) band , and intrinsic @xmath39 .",
    "the absorption corrections are based on gas column densities @xmath28 derived from the x - ray spectra .",
    "procedures of the spectral modeling and luminosity determinations are given in ",
    " 6 - 8 of getman et al .",
    "the five x - ray luminosities are effective for different purposes .",
    "the soft band emission encompasses over half of the intrinsic emission of cool t tauri stars and three - quarters of the emission of hot ob stars .",
    "it is readily compared to measurements made with the older @xmath40 @xmath11 and @xmath41 telescopes .",
    "but the soft emission is easily absorbed by intervening interstellar gas ; for typical pms x - ray spectra , @xmath42% of @xmath35 is extinguished when @xmath43 @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "although we could operationally correct for this extinction and derive @xmath46 values for each star , we do not list them because they can be very uncertain .",
    "for distant yscs which must suffer intervening absorption , we believe soft band luminosities will not provide useful measures of intrinsic x - ray emission .",
    "the hard band is much less vulnerable to extinction .",
    "the absorption - corrected hard - band luminosities @xmath37 are , we suggest , the most reliable measure of the intrinsic stellar emission that can obtain from @xmath0 data for distant or absorbed young stellar populations .",
    "the total band luminosities @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the @xmath0 data to the fullest extent and provide the strongest signal .",
    "@xmath39 is the most valuable quantity for comparisons between lightly obscured yscs , but it will underestimate the true emission for obscured or embedded populations due to the problematic absorption in the soft band .",
    "we also recognize that some of the @xmath28 values derived in @xcite may be inaccurate due to incorrect choice of spectral model ( cf .",
    "the outliers in figure [ nh_av.fig ] below ) , leading to systematic errors in @xmath39 values .",
    "however , @xmath37 values are relatively unaffected by this problem .",
    "the coup census of the young population provides a new opportunity to investigate the spatial structure of the orion nebula cluster which allows inferences regarding the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "figure [ morph_img.fig ] shows the spatial distribution of the samples described in  [ samples.sec ] .",
    "the structure of the coup lightly obscured cool star sample ( figure [ morph_img.fig ] top ) follows closely the shape of the onir sample studied by @xcite , though with about half of the stellar density .",
    "this is shown in the comparison of the stellar surface density radial profiles plotted in figure [ morph_rad.fig ] .",
    "their onir sample is richer than the coup onc sample due to their better sensitivity to low - mass members with @xmath47 m@xmath6 , their inclusion of some absorbed stars which we place in the heavily absorbed sample , and the reduced sensitivity of coup within 1 ( @xmath48 deg ) of @xmath4 ori c due to the extended wings of its point spread function .",
    "if one assumes spherical symmetry ( but see  [ onc_asym.sec ] ) , these radial distributions can be roughly modelled as isothermal spheres with core radii @xmath49 or @xmath50 pc @xcite . to assist interpretation of other young stellar clusters , we calculate the x - ray properties of this @xmath51 pc diameter core region based on the lightly obscured sample .",
    "the central surface density of the cool coup stars is @xmath52 stars deg@xmath53 or @xmath54 stars pc@xmath53 .",
    "their integrated x - ray luminosities are @xmath55 erg s@xmath56 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 )  =  32.4 ( 32.5 ) erg s@xmath56 , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 )  =  32.8 ( 33.0 ) erg s@xmath56 .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness averaged over the core for these cool stars is @xmath57 erg s@xmath56 pc@xmath53 , 3.6  ( 4.4)@xmath58 erg s@xmath56 pc@xmath53 , and 0.9  ( 1.5)@xmath59 erg s@xmath56 pc@xmath53 in the soft , hard and total ( absorption - corrected ) bands , respectively .",
    "if one includes the hot stars lying in the core region ( @xmath4 ori c , @xmath4 ori a , @xmath4 ori d , and the two coup components of @xmath4 ori b ) , these central surface brightnesses rise to @xmath60 erg s@xmath56 pc@xmath53 , @xmath61 erg s@xmath56 pc@xmath53 , and 3  ( 5)@xmath59 erg s@xmath56 pc@xmath53 .",
    "though few in number , the hot o7-b3 stars dominate the x - ray emission in all bands in this central region .    illustrating the application of these results",
    ", we consider the cool star component of the onc viewed from a distance of 2 kpc ( 8 kpc ) .",
    "its core region would then subtend 31 ( 8) with a hard band flux @xmath62 erg s@xmath56 @xmath17 ( @xmath63 erg s@xmath56 @xmath17 ) producing @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) counts in a 100 ks @xmath0 acis exposure .",
    "these hard band count rates are unchanged for most realistic lines - of - sight through the galaxy ( @xmath66 @xmath17 ) . if the point source detection limit was 10 counts and the cluster was at 2 kpc , 47 stars with @xmath67 erg s@xmath56 would be individually resolved and the integrated emission of 55 fainter stars would produce a diffuse glow . if the cluster was at 8 kpc , 8 stars with @xmath68 erg s@xmath56 would be individually resolved .",
    "the integrated hot star contribution would be 2.3 - 2.5 times higher than the cool star component and many , but not all , of the stars earlier than b4 would be individually identified as bright point sources .",
    "we conclude that the core region of the onc can be readily detected and discriminated from point - like sources across the galactic disk in _",
    "chandra _ images .",
    "@xcite model the stellar surface density as ellipses with ellipticity @xmath69 oriented nearly north - south .",
    "however , examination of the coup distribution in figure [ morph_img.fig ] shows a distinct asymmetry : the surface density of cluster members @xmath70 east of @xmath4 ori c is considerably below that seen in a similar region to the west .",
    "this deficit of onc stars west of @xmath4 ori c is also evident in optical samples ( e.g. , figure  3 of hillenbrand 1997 and figure  16 of bate et al .",
    "1998 ) . from coup data",
    ", we can state with some confidence that this deficit is not due to absorption by cloud material along the line - of - sight .",
    "an absorbing cloud component known as the dark bay obscures the hii region on the western side starting @xmath71 west of @xmath4 ori c @xcite .",
    "but optical extinction and radio hi measurements indicate the dark bay column density to the bright nebula is only @xmath72 @xmath17 @xcite , which has negligible effect on the @xmath0 count rates and is insufficient to produce a significant loss in sensitivity to x - ray stars .",
    "the east - west asymmetry in the unobscured coup population thus appears to be an intrinsic characteristic of the cluster .",
    "the application of equilibrium dynamical models , such as isothermal king models , may therefore not be justified , at least for the outer regions of the cluster on scales @xmath73 or 0.5 pc .",
    "this agrees with the calculation of @xcite that the cluster has not had time to achieve dynamical equilibrium ; they estimate the two - body encounter relaxation time is 6.5 myr for the inner 0.8 pc radius region .",
    "they then suggest that the cluster is either in the process of violent relaxation when large - scale asymmetries are prevalent , or its structure today represents its original configuration at formation .",
    "based on the measured velocity dispersion @xmath74 km s@xmath56 , the crossing time for a typical star across a 0.8 pc distance is only 0.3 myr , considerably shorter than the typical @xmath75 myr age of onc stars .",
    "primordial asymmetries and substructures should therefore have been quickly erased , as established by @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the most likely explanation for the asymmetry seen in the coup unobscured population is that the onc is in the process of violent relaxation leading to a temporary asymmetrical spatial distribution of stars @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the onc is the only case where violent relaxation has been arguably detected in a young stellar cluster .",
    "the large - scale distribution ( @xmath76 pc diameter ) of obscured stars is more centrally condensed than the lightly obscured onc component and also clearly does not show a dynamically relaxed structure ( figure [ morph_img.fig ] bottom ) .",
    "these coup sources tend to lie along the north - south dense molecular filament extending from several arcminutes south of omc-1s northward towards omc-2/3/4 @xcite .",
    "a strong concentration of sources is seen around the bn / kl region @xmath71 to the northwest of the trapezium , and a second weaker concentration can be seen around the orion 1-south cloud core @xmath77 southwest of @xmath4 ori c. very similar concentrations of were found among @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) in the sensitive @xmath80-band study of @xcite .",
    "the bn / kl and omc-1s coup populations are discussed in detail by @xcite ; the reader should consult this study for detailed study of their x - ray properties .    the existence of such stellar concentrations on @xmath81 pc scales , and their associations with molecular cloud cores , is a clear indication that these stars are very young . a population born with @xmath82",
    "km s@xmath56 velocity dispersion would spread @xmath83 pc ( 4 ) in 0.2 myr .",
    "the small - scale inhomogeneities associated with bn / kl and orion 1-south thus imply stellar ages of @xmath84 myr .    it is interesting to note that these structures have not been clearly evident in earlier studies .",
    "past onir samples have not penetrated sufficiently deeply into the cloud to match the coup obscured sample , where the average absorption is @xmath85 @xmath17 equivalent to @xmath86 mag .",
    "past mid - infrared surveys have been restricted to small regions around the dense molecular cores , although forthcoming wide - field surveys with the _ spitzer space telescope",
    "_ will overcome this limitation .",
    "table [ xlum.tab ] provides the per - star average and integrated sample luminosities of the coup samples in the x - ray bands discussed in  [ x_lum.sec ] . in the hard band ,",
    "the integrated contributions of the lightly and heavily obscured cool star samples to the integrated orion nebula population luminosity are similar with @xmath87 erg s@xmath56 .",
    "the hot stars , dominated by the uniquely luminous star @xmath4 ori c , emit at nearly the same level with @xmath88 erg s@xmath56 ( table [ xmass.tab ] ) .",
    "thus , in the hard band which is largely unaffected by obscuration , the orion nebula emission is roughly equally divided between the lightly obscured onc , the heavily obscured stars ( including both obscured onc stars and the embedded population around the omc-1 cores ) , and the few o stars .",
    "other star forming regions will necessarily exhibit different ratios between the unobscured , obscured and ob populations in the x - ray band . we suspect that the o stars will dominate the total hard - band emission in richer yscs .",
    "figure [ xlf_samp.fig ] shows the binned differential xlf for the samples in the total and hard spectral bands , corrected for absorption .",
    "recall that the total band luminosities will underestimate true values for heavily absorbed stars , even with the attempted correction , because soft components are sometimes completely missing from the spectral model .",
    "the shape of the xlf can be roughly understood as a convolution of the stellar imf , which breaks from the salpeter powerlaw below @xmath89m@xmath6 , and the correlation between x - ray luminosity and mass .",
    "these two effects result in a steep fall - off in the number of fainter x - ray stars in a young stellar cluster .",
    "this explains why the factor of ten increase in the limiting sensitivity of coup over the previous @xmath0 observations of the region @xcite led to only a modest increase in the number of detected lightly - absorbed onc stars .",
    "the xlf of orion nebula stars spans 5 orders of magnitude , from low - mass stars at or below the coup detection limit of @xmath90 erg s@xmath56 to @xmath91 m@xmath6 stars attaining @xmath92 erg s@xmath56 at the peaks of flares .",
    "as noted by @xcite and @xcite , the shapes of the xlfs are roughly lognormal . using the unobscured sample as a template for cool star ysc populations in general , we find a @xmath93 erg s@xmath56 with standard deviation @xmath94 and , for the hard band , @xmath95 erg s@xmath56 with standard deviation @xmath96 .",
    "however , the xlf shapes are not precisely lognormal ; the tails follow a lognormal shape but the peak is nearly flat from @xmath97 to 30.5 erg s@xmath56 .",
    "magnetic reconnection flares and systematic decline of x - ray luminosity with age will flatten the peak of the xlf , but these effects are considerably smaller than the factor of @xmath98 seen in the coup xlf @xcite .",
    "an important corollary of the lognormal shape at the lower tail is that extraordinarily few stars appear around the coup sensitivity limit .",
    "we thus have high signals on nearly all coup sources .",
    "this will not be true for most other @xmath0 ysc observations where the exposure is shorter and the distance is greater .",
    "if the lognormal shape at the upper tail is universal , then @xmath0 observations should attempt to reach @xmath99 erg s@xmath56 to capture sufficient cool stars to adequately define the amplitude of the curve .",
    "this would provide a powerful means for estimating the total ysc population independent of the distribution of ob stars .",
    "in addition , fitting xlfs to the orion template offers a new distance measure to yscs across the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the high - luminosity portions ( above @xmath100 erg s@xmath56 ) of the unobscured and obscured xlfs are very similar , but the obscured sample appears to be missing a substantial fraction of the weaker sources .",
    "this is true even in the hard band where x - rays can penetrate @xmath101 @xmath17 .",
    "one possibility is that a significant fraction of the lower - mass , x - ray - weaker sources are obscured by very high column densities , perhaps due to localized circumstellar material ( i.e. a protostellar envelope or disk ) .",
    "for example , a source with @xmath102 erg s@xmath56 and a typical @xmath103 kev thermal spectrum will be reduced below the coup detection limit if @xmath104 @xmath44 ( @xmath105 mag ) .",
    "information on masses of orion nebula population stars is mostly restricted to the lightly obscured onc population with spectroscopic study by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* updated in getman et al .",
    "we examine here 523 coup sources associated with stars with spectroscopic mass estimates ; this sample is somewhat larger than the 481 stars considered by @xcite because they truncate their sample at @xmath106 m@xmath6 .",
    "we reiterate that this coup sample is not a complete representation of the underlying cluster because a large fraction of very low mass cluster members are missing .",
    "these constitute an important fraction of the cluster imf , but collectively contribute very little to the integrated x - ray luminosity .",
    "table [ xmass.tab ] gives the average and integrated luminosities of mass ranges in the onc .",
    "figure [ xlf_fraction mass.fig ] summarizes the results by showing the percent of the total emission @xmath107 contributed by different mass strata .",
    "figure [ xlf_mass.fig ] shows the mass - stratified differential xlfs .",
    "the table shows that 54% ( 34% ) [ 47% ] of the total nebula luminosity in the soft ( hard ) [ absorption - corrected total ] band is produced by the most massive @xmath108 m@xmath6 member , @xmath4 ori c. omitting @xmath4 ori c from further consideration , figure [ xlf_mass.fig ] show that the solar - mass stratum ( @xmath109 m@xmath6 ) dominates the integrated cluster x - ray luminosity , contributing about 41% ( 41% ) [ 41% ] in the soft ( hard ) [ total ] band .",
    "stars around the peak of the imf with masses @xmath110 m@xmath6 are individually fainter but more numerous .",
    "they collectively contribute 19% ( 32% ) [ 26% ] of the cluster luminosity .",
    "the very low mass stars and brown dwarfs contribute less than 7% of the onc emission in all bands .",
    "a clear trend of x - ray luminosities increasing with mass is seen in the xlfs ( figure [ xlf_mass.fig ] ) .",
    "the @xmath111 trend was suggested in @xmath41 data @xcite and is well - documented in @xmath0 studies of the onc @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath112 m@xmath6 subsample does not obviously follow the trend .",
    "@xcite find that the onc b star population does not have homogeneous x - ray properties : some are x - ray quiet , others have magnetically confined wind emission , and others emit over a wide range of luminosities due to unresolved lower mass companions .",
    "detection of individual sources in @xmath0 observations of distant yscs will be flux limited at some level in the xlfs shown in figure [ xlf_mass.fig ] depending on the cluster distance @xmath113 and the duration of the exposure @xmath114 .",

    "these comprise nearly all cluster members with @xmath123 m@xmath6 and most of the stars with @xmath124 m@xmath6 .",
    "sensitivities of @xmath125 erg s@xmath56 capture 81% of the coup population , or 1140 of 1408 stars including nearly all of the cluster population with @xmath126 m@xmath6 . only a modest improvement ( 15% of member stars )",
    "is made by further increasing the sensitivity down to @xmath127 erg s@xmath56 due to the steep drop in the cluster xlf .    as the sensitivity limit increases from @xmath128 to 30.0 ( 29.0 ) [ 28.0 ] erg s@xmath56 as one moves from distant to nearby yscs , the integrated luminosity of the cluster stars which are not individually detected declines from 32.9 to 32.3 ( 32.2 ) [ 30.0 ] erg s@xmath56 .",
    "these photons will appear as a diffuse x - ray structure around the detected sources . in lower sensitivity images , the integrated emission from unresolved ysc stars",
    "can be confused with intrinsically diffuse plasma associated with o star wind shocks .",
    "this issue is discussed by @xcite .",
    "the lightly obscured subsample of 839 stars includes 19 which are strong enough to suffer photon pileup in the acis - i detector .",
    "we first considered the 820 coup sources without pileup .",
    "the _ acis extract _ software was used to create a composite spectrum and exposure - weighted auxiliary response files ( arfs ) for spectral analysis using the _ xspec _ software ( for details , see  7 of * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting composite spectrum and best - fit two - temperature model are shown in figure [ comp_spec.fig ] .",
    "the model parameters are column density @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 kev , @xmath132 kev with non - solar abundances .",
    "the integrated luminosity of these 820 stars over the total @xmath25 kev band is @xmath133 erg s@xmath56 ; the luminosity of the 19 piled - up stars is @xmath134 erg s@xmath56 .",
    "thus , the spectrum in figure [ comp_spec.fig ] constitutes about 40% of the lightly obscured orion nebula stellar x - ray emission .",
    "abundance excesses far above ( factor of 10 or more ) solar were found for oxygen , nitrogen , neon , magnesium , sulfur , argon , calcium and iron .",
    "the fit is not statistically valid and the reliability of the individual abundances is uncertain ; this is not surprising given the enormous complexity of the plasma from hundreds of magnetically active stars .",
    "however , visual examination of the spectrum in figure [ comp_spec.fig ] shows that the strongest line complex is from ne ix and ne x lines around 1 kev .",
    "the dashed spectrum shows the best - fit spectrum with the neon abundance artificially set at solar levels . the flux at 1 kev is effectively doubled by the excess neon , which constitutes about 7% of the total @xmath25 kev luminosity .",
    "excess emission at 1 kev thus has the potential to be a useful diagnostic of magnetically active stars in yscs , providing they are not so heavily obscured that the 1 kev emission is absorbed .",
    "the absorption of soft x - rays by bound - free electronic transitions provides a unique way to measure line - of - sight column densities of interstellar matter .",
    "onir extinction curves measure only dust particles , 21-cm emission measures only warm hi , and molecular line studies measure only specific gas - phase species . in comparison ,",
    "x - ray absorption measures the integrated effects of various elements ( c , o , n and ne are most important although h and he play a significant role ) in all phases of intervening material .",
    "the spectral dependence of the photoelectric absorption scales as ( e / kev)@xmath135 for a solar abundance mixture of elements @xcite , and the integrated effect on the intrinsic spectrum is traditionally expressed in terms of the equivalent column density @xmath22 of hydrogen atoms along the line - of - sight . the most detailed study to date that compares x- ray absorption to onir dust extinction",
    "used obscured young stars in the @xmath136 ophiuchi cloud to derive the gas - to - dust absorption ratio @xmath137 atoms @xmath17 mag@xmath56 @xcite .",
    "a similar study of obscured coup sources is underway . because the absorption varies widely from @xmath138 to @xmath139 @xmath44 ( @xmath140 to @xmath65 mag ) from star to star in the coup observations , and",
    "will also differ between yscs depending on their location in the galaxy and in their natal molecular cloud , the distribution of absorptions seen in orion has no direct relevance to studies of other yscs .",
    "figure [ nh_av.fig ] plots @xmath28 from coup _ xspec _ fits @xcite against dust absorption @xmath23 derived by @xcite from optical photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the sample shown is restricted to 268 coup sources with more than 1000 source counts with very low @xmath28 while others , as in figure [ nh_av.fig ] , showed zero @xmath23 with high @xmath28 .",
    "such discrepant points are still present in the full coup sample , but many disappear when the coup data are restricted to sources with @xmath141 counts where the _ xspec _ fitting procedure is most reliable . the formal error on @xmath28 from _ xspec _ fitting is typically @xmath142 .",
    "we believe the scatter and discrepancies in the diagram shown here are probably no longer due to _ xspec _ fitting errors . ] .",
    "the coup @xmath28 values generally , but not always , agree with the visual absorption for @xmath143 atoms @xmath17 mag@xmath56 .",
    "the values set at @xmath144 represent cases where the photometric colors are too blue for the spectral type .",
    "the discrepancies between @xmath145 and @xmath23 might arise from instrumental difficulties , such as erroneous choice of x - ray spectral model ( as shown in figure 6 of getman et al .",
    "2005 ) or errors in the optical photometry due to photospheric variability , binarity , scattered light , or inaccurate calibration of pre - main sequence photospheric colors .",
    "they may also represent unusual dust properties in the local environments around certain young stellar objects .",
    "svs 16 in the ngc  1333 cloud and ec 95 in the serpens cloud are two clear case where @xmath23 derived from infrared photometry was overestimated compared to the x - ray - derived @xmath28 @xcite , perhaps due to unusual geometries of circumstellar dust or the disappearance of the gaseous component of the disk . in the coup sources with discrepant absorption measurements , @xmath23 may be too low because circumstellar disk grains have coagulated into large particles while the gas component is still present .",
    "the coup study can also provide practical guidance for estimation of individual @xmath28 measurements in yscs where the signal may be insufficient for nonlinear parametric spectral modelling of individual sources .",
    "figure [ nh_mede.fig ] shows that the median energy of background - subtracted acis events for each source , the quantity @xmath29 listed in table 3 of getman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , is a reliable indicator for the absorbing column density @xmath28 obtained from spectral fitting procedures .",
    "other researchers have also found that median energies are effective spectral estimators in x - ray ccd spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear relationship can be empirically approximated by two curves .",
    "for relatively soft sources @xmath146 $ ] kev , @xmath147 @xmath17 . for harder sources with @xmath148 kev , @xmath149 @xmath17 .",
    "a concatenation of these curves is plotted as the red dashed line in figure [ nh_mede.fig ] . for values of @xmath29 around @xmath150 kev ,",
    "the scatter is great and one can confidently conclude only that @xmath151 @xmath17 . since @xmath29 is easily obtained for sources as faint as a few counts , which often dominate samples in distant and obscured yscs , this empirical conversion from @xmath29 provides an effective procedure for approximating @xmath28 values for individual stars .",
    "note that any source with @xmath152 kev is probably too soft to be a member of the low - mass orion population even with no obscuration ; such sources may be older foreground field disk stars or shocks from protostellar outflows .    using the gray curves in figure  [ nh_mede.fig ] derived from _",
    "_ simulations of absorbed one - temperature thermal spectra , we also note a trend of increasing temperature with increasing median energy .",
    "plasma temperatures are typical @xmath153 for @xmath154 , and increase to @xmath155 for @xmath156 .",
    "this trend can further assist in characterizing distant and faint orion population stars .",
    "this study establishes the global x - ray properties of the stellar population associated with the orion nebula stellar population  the light - obscured orion nebula cluster ( onc ) and the heavily - obscured stars associated with molecular material in its vicinity .",
    "the analysis is based on the @xmath0 orion ultradeep project s 9.7 day observation of the region in january 2003 described by getman et al .",
    "care is taken to remove extragalactic and foreground contaminants from the sample .",
    "the information serves both to further understanding of the nearest rich ysc , and to use the orion nebula as a template for understanding less sensitive x - ray observations of more distant yscs erg s@xmath56 per o star in the @xmath157 kev band .",
    "this is @xmath158 times larger than the value we obtain in the orion nebula because their result is dominated by the contributions of supernova remnants and x - ray binary systems from earlier generations of massive star formation .",
    "the helfand - moran value is more appropriate for large - scale and long - lived starburst complexes and galaxies , while our result is more applicable to small - scale and short - lived individual yscs .",
    "observers of distant high - mass star forming regions must exercise caution , as supernova remnants and x - ray binaries may be present near regions of current star formation . ] .",
    "the x - ray emission of the orion nebula region can be divided into three components : several ob stars dominated by @xmath4 ori c , a rich population of 822 lightly obscured cool stars associated with the orion nebula cluster , and a population of 559 heavily obscured stars .",
    "these components contribute roughly equally to the orion nebula stellar emission in the hard @xmath1 kev band ; the integrated absorption - corrected luminosity of each component is about @xmath159 erg s@xmath56 in the hard @xmath1 kev band and @xmath160 erg s@xmath56 in the total @xmath25 kev band .",
    "the lightly obscured sample shows a radial profile similar to that seen in optical and near - infrared samples .",
    "the inner region can be characterized by an isothermal core emitting @xmath161 erg s@xmath56 pc@xmath53 in the @xmath25 kev band .",
    "the coup stars in the outer region on scales @xmath2  pc from @xmath4 ori c show a strong spatial asymmetry that we attribute to a temporary period of violent relaxation in the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "the obscured coup sources show concentrations around both omc-1 molecular cores .",
    "their small - scale substructures indicate these stars are very young , probably with ages @xmath3 myr .",
    "the xlf of the lightly obscured sample is approximately lognormal in shape with @xmath162 erg s@xmath56 and standard deviation @xmath163 .",
    "the peak of the xlf shape can serve as a standard candle for a new distance measure to yscs across the galactic disk .",
    "the obscured population shows a deficit in lower - luminosity stars , even in the hard band .",
    "this suggests a significant population of stars with localized circumstellar material producing column densities @xmath164 @xmath17 is missing from the coup sample .",
    "mass - stratified xlfs show that , in the hard band , one - third of the orion nebula emission is produced by the x - ray - bright o6 star @xmath4 ori c and half is produced by lower mass pre - main sequence stars with masses @xmath5 m@xmath6 .",
    "the numerous very low mass stars and brown dwarfs contribute little to the total x - ray emission .",
    "the integrated spectra of the low mass stars is well fit by a two - temperature plasma model with super - solar abundances of several elements .",
    "the neon line complex around 1 kev is particularly strong and might serve as a tracer of magnetically active stars in distant yscs .",
    "we establish that the median energy of acis counts is an excellent predictor for the absorbing column density @xmath28 in orion stars .",
    "however , discrepancies between @xmath28 from gas and visual absorption @xmath23 from dust are sometimes present .",
    "the cause of this is uncertain .    using the @xmath1 kev hard band emission",
    ", we show that young stellar clusters like the orion nebula can be readily detected and resolved with @xmath0 across the galactic disk , even in the presence of heavy obscuration .",
    "this confirms earlier arguments that x - ray telescopes can effectively trace star formation throughout the galaxy @xcite . for more distant clusters , however",
    ", only the brightest x - ray stars are individually detected while the remaining population is seen as a diffuse glow .",
    "our study of the orion nebula as a template for x - ray studies of distant star forming regions gives this principle a stronger quantitative foundation .",
