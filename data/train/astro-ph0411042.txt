    "the excellent spatial resolution of @xmath0 x - ray observatory has opened a new era to study the large scale jets in powerful extragalactic radio sources . at the time of this writing ,",
    "more than 40 radio - loud agns are known to possess x - ray counterparts of radio jets on kpc to mpc scales ( harris & krawczynski 2002 , stawarz 2004 and references therein ; see also ` http://hea-www.harvard.edu/xjet/ ` ) .",
    "bright x - ray knots ( hereafter `` jet - knots '' ) are most often detected , but the x - ray emissions from the hotspots and radio lobes are also reported in a number of fr ii radio galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , wilson , young & shopbell 2000 ; 2001 ; hardcastle et al . 2002b ; 2004 , tashiro et al .",
    "1998 ; isobe 2002 ) .",
    "the broad - band spectra of jet - knots , hotspots , and lobes detected by @xmath0 show great variety between radio and x - ray energy bands . in nearby fr",
    "i sources , typical x - ray - optical - radio spectrum of the jet - knots is consistent with a single smoothly broken power - law continuum , suggesting that this broad - band emission is entirely due to non - thermal synchrotron radiation from a single electron population ( e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "2002 and wilson & yang 2002 for m  87 ) . in most other sources",
    ", however , the x - ray knots spectra are much harder than expected from a simple extrapolation of the radio - to - optical fluxes .",
    "these situations are believed that both the radio and optical emissions are due to synchrotron radiation , whereas x - ray photons are produced via the inverse - compton scattering of either synchrotron photons ( ssc ) or cosmic microwave background photons ( ec ; tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 , celotti , ghisellini & chiaberge 2001 ) .",
    "other ( synchrotron ) models have been also proposed to explain intense x - ray emission of the large - scale quasar jets ( e.g. , dermer & atoyan 2002 , stawarz & ostrowski 2002 ) . in the case of the hotspots in powerful sources",
    "one finds an analogous controversy regarding the x - ray emission : although in many objects this emission is consistent with the standard ssc model ( see , e.g. , wilson et al .",
    "2000 for cygnus  a ) , in some other sources it can not be simply explained in this way , suggesting most likely a synchrotron origin of the detected x - ray photons ( see , e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "for the extended lobes of quasars and fr iis the x - ray radiation is established to be produced by the ec process involving cmb target radiation . in some cases",
    ", however , infrared target photons from quasar cores may contribute to the inverse - compton lobes emission at kev photon energy range ( brunetti , setti & comastri 1997 ) .    in the standard picture of",
    "fr ii radio galaxies and quasars , the relativistic jet is decelerated in a hotspot converting part of its energy into relativistic electrons and part in magnetic field .",
    "then the shocked plasma moves inside the head region just behind the hotspot , and expands almost adiabatically to form diffuse , extended radio lobes .",
    "even though this picture appears to be simple , much of the fundamental physics behind it remains unclear ( see , e.g. , recent monograph by de young 2002a ) .",
    "for example , the velocity and dynamics of the large - scale jets is unknown . from the analogy to sub - pc jets in blazar - type agns",
    ", it is plausible that some of the fr ii and quasar jets are highly relativistic even on kpc / mpc scales .",
    "recent studies on the optical emission of the large - scale jets seem to justify this hypothesis ( e.g. , sparks et al .",
    "1995 , scarpa & urry 2002 , jester 2003 ) , and the usually discussed versions of the ec model for the x - ray jet - knots indeed require the jet bulk lorentz factors @xmath3 ( e.g. , harris & krawczynski 2002 ) .",
    "yet , the exact velocity structure both along and across large - scale jets in fr ii radio galaxies and quasars remains an open issue .",
    "the strong terminal shocks at the hotspots are unlikely to be moving with high bulk lorentz factors , but moderately relativistic motions ( @xmath4 @xmath5 a few ) are permitted by hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , aloy et al .",
    "we note , that such simulations repeatedly reveal a complex hotspots morphology , especially at the late stages of the jet evolution ( e.g. , marti et al .",
    "1997 , mizuta , yamada & takabe 2004 ) .",
    "finally , the main - axis expansion of radio lobe is thought to be sub - relativistic ; @xmath4 @xmath6 1 .",
    "however , detailed transport and spatial distribution of the radiating particles within the lobes of powerful radio sources is still being debated ( e.g. , blundell & rawlings 2000 , kaiser 2000 , manolakou & kirk 2003 ) .    as for the velocity of jet plasma , the strength of magnetic field in radio galaxies is an open matter .",
    "assuming an equipartition field value in the lobes ( 1@xmath210 @xmath7 g ) , which seems to be supported by the x - ray lobes observations , a simple flux conservation argument predicts the magnetic field in the jets as high as 0.01@xmath21 g ( de young 2002b ) .",
    "such a strong magnetic field is problematic , since numerical simulations of poynting - flux dominated jets ( e.g. , komissarov 1999 ) can not correctly reproduce the observed large - scale morphologies of powerful radio sources .",
    "thus , an amplification of the magnetic field to the equipartition value in strong jet terminal shock and in its turbulent downstream region is required , although only little theoretical investigations of this issue has been reported ( see de young 2002b ) .",
    "let us mention in this context , that turbulent processes that may lead to amplification of the magnetic field can manifest in formation of the flat - spectrum synchrotron x - ray features , such like the ones discovered recently in the hotspots of cygnus a radio galaxy ( bauciska - church et al .",
    "on the other hand , the equipartition of energy between the magnetic field and the radiating electrons , established for some high - luminosity sources , may not be valid in general , especially in the case of low - luminosity hotspots ( hardcastle et al .",
    "finally , we note that the configuration of the magnetic field within the lobes is also not well understood ( see a discussion in blundell & rawlings 2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately , present radio - to - x - ray observations are not sufficient to discriminate conclusively between different models proposed in order to explain multiwavelength emission of the large - scale structures of powerful radio sources , and of their kpc / mpc jets in particular .",
    "however , we believe that a systematic comparison between broad - band radiative properties of the jet - knots , hotspots , and lobes will provide important clues to dynamics and the physics of large scale jets , and to put some constraints on the models discussed in the literature . keeping these motivations in mind , the purpose of this paper is to obtain a rough , but unified picture which may link the jet - knots , hotspots and radio lobes , rather than modeling individual sources in a sufficiently detailed manner . obviously , detailed studies on individual cases are irreplaceable .",
    "in fact , many controversial issues briefly touched in this analysis will remain open until such detailed investigations , based on long multiwavelength observations , are performed .",
    "we emphasize , that our analysis confirms many results known from the literature ( see , e.g. , stawarz 2004 for a review ) , although for a large number of sources modeled in addition in a uniform way .",
    "basing on this homogeneous approach , we explore however some new , hardly discuss in the literature aspects of the physics behind the x - ray emission models for the considered objects .",
    "let us also mention , that in this paper we do not consider hadronic models for the broad - band emission of the large - scale jets and their hotspots ( see , e.g. , aharonian 2002 , atoyan & dermer 2004 ) .",
    "our presented study is based on data analysis for a sample consisting of 26 radio galaxies , 14 quasars , and 4 blazars .",
    "we collected all existing data at well sampled radio ( 5 ghz ) and x - ray ( 1 kev ) frequencies and analyzed them in a systematic manner . in @xmath82 , we defined sample selection and observables used in this paper . in @xmath83 , we presented a simple formulation of calculating the `` expected '' x - ray flux densities for the ssc and ec models taking the relativistic beaming effect into account .",
    "we then compared the physical quantities ( beaming factor and the magnetic field ) of the jet - knots , hotspots , and lobes . in @xmath84",
    "we discuss the results and the summary is presented in @xmath85 .",
    "table 1 compiles a list of `` x - ray jet sources '' in which jet - knots , hotspots and/or radio lobes are detected by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the first pioneer work have been reported by harris & krawczynski ( 2002 ) , where the emission mechanisms of 18 x - ray jet sources ( mainly jet - knots ) are discussed in the framework of relativistically moving jet model .",
    "they continue to maintain current information at ` http://hea-www.harvard.edu /xjet/ ` , which conveniently summarize the name , coordinate , distance , and morphology of the x - ray jet sources .",
    "our sample contains all of the sources listed in this page , with additional information on the x - ray observations of radio lobes mainly organized by @xmath1 .    before compiling the data",
    ", we have performed quick re - analysis of @xmath0 data ( if already archived ) to check the published results , and found no discrepancy .",
    "we therefore refer to published results ( fluxes and spectral indices ) unless otherwise stated in this paper .",
    "this gives a large number of objects known to us as of 2004 june , which contains 44 x - ray jet sources ( 56 jet - knots , 24 hotspots , and 18 radio lobes : see table 2 ) .",
    "we are aware that our sample is still incomplete , as the known x - ray jet sources are increasing their number day by day .",
    "nevertheless such a list provides a convenient overview of x - ray jet sources detected so far , and provide a useful hint to @xmath9 fluxes of unobserved x - ray jet sources .",
    "we also note that hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) recently summarizes the x - ray emission properties of the hotspots in fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "the basic information about each source are listed in table 1 : ( 1 ) source name , ( 2 ) redshift @xmath10 , ( 3 ) luminosity distance to the source @xmath11 adopting @xmath12 = 75 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 and @xmath14 = 0.5 , ( 4 ) classification , and ( 5 ) references .",

    "more detailed information on each source are listed in table 2 . in the second column",
    "we denote `` knot ( k ) '' to indicate a distinct structure in the jet , `` hotspots ( hs ) '' as a terminal bright enhancement at an end of the fr ii jet or as one of the multiple features associated with a termination of the jet , and `` lobe ( l ) '' as a diffuse extended structure associated with a radio lobe . a suffix after k , hs , and",
    "l means the identification of each structure .",
    "for example `` k - a '' denotes ` knot - a' and `` hs - se '' means `` south - east hotspot '' . in succeeding columns of table 2",

    "when observations have not been reported at 5 ghz or 1 kev , we calculate the flux by extrapolating the nearest measured frequency by assuming the spectral index listed in the table .",
    "a suffix @xmath23 means that we have assumed the fixed value for this calculation .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the spectral indices in the radio band ( @xmath15 ; @xmath24 ) and in the x - ray band ( @xmath17 ; @xmath25 ) , respectively .",
    "note that radio spectral index shows a relatively narrow distribution centered at 0.8 and there is no clear difference between the jet - knots , hotstpots and radio lobes .",
    "as is widely believed , the radio emissions of these sources are most likely due to the synchrotron radiation from the low - energy population of relativistic electrons . in other words , energy index of accelerated electron",
    "is narrowly distributed around @xmath26 = ( @xmath15 + 1)/2 @xmath6 2.6 , which is slightly steeper than the one expected from a diffusive acceleration at nonrelativistic shocks , @xmath26 = @xmath27 .",
    "let us note in this context , that analytical and numerical studies of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks ( reviewed by , e.g. , kirk & duffy 1999 and ostrowski 2002 ) , indicate that in such a case one can expect variety of particle spectra , with the asymptotic power - law inclination @xmath26 = @xmath28 for the strong turbulence condition and ultrarelativistic shock velocity .",
    "we also note , that stochastic second - order fermi processes do not favor any universal value of the power - law spectral index characterizing accelerated electrons .",
    "meanwhile , the x - ray energy index , @xmath17 , is widely distributed from 0.2 to 1.6 .",
    "part of the reason may be relatively large uncertainties in determining the spectral shape of faint x - ray sources compared to the radio spectral shape , but even if only bright ( i.e. , small error bars ) x - ray sources are plotted , the same trend is obtained .",
    "steep x - ray sources are most frequently found in nearby fr i radio galaxies . as discussed in the literature",
    ", the x - ray fluxes in these sources may smoothly connect with radio / optical fluxes and hence are considered to be the highest energy tail of the synchrotron radiation . for the x - ray emission from other jet - knots the situation is less clear .",
    "flat x - ray spectral indices may indicate pile - up effects at the high - energy part of the electron energy distribution , advocating thus synchrotron origin of the kev photons ( see harris , mossman & walker 2004 ) , or , oppositely , spectral flattenings occurring at the low - energy part of the electron continuum thus being consistent with the ec interpretation of the x - ray knots emission .",
    "clearly , spectral information alone are not sufficient at the moment to distinguish either between synchrotron and inverse - compton origin of the kev photons from the jet - knots in most of the cases , or to indicate the appropriate particle acceleration process .     and @xmath29 .",

    "note that a clear difference can be seen between the jet - knot and hotspot or radio lobes .",
    "the jet - knots tend to be much brighter in x - rays compared to the hotspots and radio lobes .",
    "this trend is seen more clearly in figure 3 , where the correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is plotted in two dimensional space .",
    "one finds several important tendencies which can not be accounted by the sampling bias effect .",
    "first , hotspots and radio lobes occupy only the high - luminosity part of the plot , namely @xmath38 10@xmath39 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "secondly , low - luminosity hotspots tend to be brighter in x - ray , as has been pointed out by hardcastle et al .",
    "thirdly , @xmath30",
    "@xmath38 @xmath31 for most of the hotspots and radio lobes , but most of the jet - knots show an opposite trend .     and @xmath40 . ]",
    "we should note that due to limited sensitivity of @xmath0 ( typically 0.1 njy at 1 kev for 10 ksec exposure ) , we would not expect to detect the x - ray emission from the `` x - ray faint '' jet - knots .",
    "therefore the lack of the x - ray faint ( i.e. , @xmath30 @xmath38 @xmath31 ) jet - knots at the bottom left corner of figure 3 would be biased by the sensitivity of @xmath0 detector .",
    "in fact , we can find a few x - ray faint jet - knots at the top right corner , where the luminosity is the highest .",
    "however , even if only high - luminosity sources are selected , we can see a clear difference between the jet - knots , hotspots and radio lobes , namely `` x - ray bright '' sources are found only in jet - knots .",
    "apparently , this is not due to the sampling effect since we certainly would have been able to detect `` x - ray bright '' hotspots if they existed .",
    "in this section we present a simple formulation of computing an equipartition magnetic field strength @xmath41 from an observed radio flux @xmath16 measured at a radio frequency @xmath35 .",
    "next , we calculate the `` expected '' ssc and ec luminosities for @xmath41 , to compare them with the observed x - ray luminosities . in the analysis , we include possible relativistic bulk velocity of the jet plasma . taking the obtained results into account , and analyzing additionally the observed broad - band spectral properties of the compiled sources ( including optical fluxes ) , we follow the `` conservative '' classification of the compiled x - ray sources into three groups , namely ( i ) synchrotron involving single / broken power - law electron energy distribution ( syn ) , ( ii ) synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and ( iii ) external compton of cmb photons ( ec ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the validity of the applied classification scheme , and compare it briefly with the classification introduced in the literature .      in order to determine the x - ray emission properties of the large - scale jets , we first estimated the magnetic field strength under the minimum - power hypothesis using the observed radio luminosities measured at 5 ghz . as we have reviewed in @xmath81",
    ", it is generally believed that the magnetic field energy density @xmath42 and the particle energy density @xmath43 may be close to the equipartition in a number of radio sources . therefore our approach is that we first assume an equipartition to calculate `` predicted '' inverse - compton x - ray luminosities , and then compare them to the observed ones .",
    "if a large discrepancy occurs , this may suggest that equipartition is strongly violated , that the inverse - compton origin of the observed kev photons is not the case , or that we have to consider another correction factor , such as doppler beaming factor @xmath44 , as we will discuss below .",
    "since the synchrotron luminosity , @xmath45 , is proportional to @xmath43@xmath42@xmath46 , where @xmath46 is the volume of the emitting regions , we can estimate the equipartition magnetic field @xmath41 for a given luminosity observed at a radio frequency @xmath47 . under the assumption of @xmath48 relativistic beaming ( @xmath44 = 1 )",

    "we put minimum synchrotron frequency @xmath57 = @xmath47 and @xmath52 = 0.75 .",
    "the latter choice is justified by a narrow distribution of the radio spectral indices in the compiled dataset ( figure 1 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the former choice gives the @xmath58 value of @xmath41 for the observed @xmath45 at some given frequency @xmath47 .",
    "below we consider @xmath47 = @xmath35 = 5 ghz , although it is obvious that the minimum radio frequency has to be lower than this ( especially in the case of the ec model , which requires presence of low - energy electrons with energies below gev ) . however , the difference between equipartition magnetic field computed for @xmath57 = @xmath47 and for @xmath57 @xmath59 @xmath47 , respectively , is rather small , @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , the expected spectral flattenings at the low - energy part of the synchrotron continuum are likely to make this difference even smaller .    in general",
    ", an emission volume , @xmath46 , is quite uncertain for astrophysical sources due to the limited angular resolution of detectors and projection effect .",
    "we have assumed that the emitting region has a spherical volume of a certain angular radius @xmath22 [  ] for all the jet structures .",
    "this is obviously an over - simplified assumption , however it significantly reduces the complexity of the models .",
    "most of the jet - knots and hotspots are point - like sources when observed with @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore set an upper limit of @xmath22 = 0.3  , unless there are additional radio / optical observations obtained with better angular resolution . meanwhile a number of radio lobes show extended structures , but morphology is more complicated than a homogeneous sphere .",
    "we therefore calculated the volume by assuming a cylinder or a rotational ellipse , and then approximated it as a sphere which has an equal volume .    for a relativistically moving plasma , the equipartition magnetic field measured in the emitting plasma rest frame",
    "is related to the equipartition value computed for no beaming by the relation ( stawarz , sikora & ostrowski 2003 )    @xmath62    the above expression can be more conveniently written as    @xmath63 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the luminosity distance to the source , and @xmath16 is the observed radio luminosity measured at frequency @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath64 for various jet sources are calculated in table 2 for @xmath65 , what gives again the @xmath58 value of @xmath66 .",
    "we note that this particular choice does not refer exclusively to the leptonic jet model .",
    "for example , it may refer to the case of energy equipartition between jet magnetic field and radiating electrons solely .",
    "we note , that the discussion on the jet composition is still open , and the situation may be quite complex as , for example , the jet can be composed predominantly from the @xmath54@xmath55-pairs , but still remain dynamically dominated by the ( cold ) hadrons ( see sikora & madejski 2000 ) .",
    "we first consider the case where the x - ray emissions are due to the synchrotron radiation emitted by the electrons with the lorentz factor @xmath67 .",

    "let us follow the `` conservative '' hypothesis that the x - rays in these sources are due to the inverse - compton emission of either synchrotron itself ( ssc ) , or the cmb photons ( ec ) .",
    "we therefore compare the ratio between the observed flux density to that expected one from ssc and ec models ( c.f . , @xmath8 3.3 ; 3.4 ) , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , to determine which process may dominate for the x - ray production .",

    "for example , modelling of the jet - knot in pks  0637 results in @xmath107 = 600 and @xmath108 = 1,600 , meaning that the observed x - ray flux is about 1,000 times brighter than those expected from both the ec and ssc models . as we have derived in @xmath8 3.3 and 3.4 , and is well known from the literature , such discrepancy could be reduced by taking the relativistic beaming effect into account , @xmath44 @xmath59 1 , by giving up the equipartition hypothesis , @xmath87 @xmath104 @xmath41 , or by postulating a synchrotron origin of the x - ray photons due to an additional flat - spectrum electron population .",
    "none of these possibilities can be simply excluded .",
    "we will comment more about it in the next section .",
    "let us mention briefly , that due to differences in the model fitting procedure adopted in this paper as compared to the previous studies reported in the literature , some differences may occur in either specific values for the obtained model parameters ( e.g. , cf .",
    "sambruna et al .",
    "2004 for the case of ngc  6251 ) , or even in classification of some particular sources ( e.g. , cf .",

    "2003 for 3c  9 ) . yet",
    "another case is the knot a1 in quasar 3c 273 .",
    "marshall et al .",
    "( 2001 ) claimed that its x - ray emission is consistent with the extrapolation of the radio - to - optical single power - law synchrotron continuum .",
    "however , jester et al . ( 2002 ) have shown that this is not the case , as the observed x - ray flux thereby @xmath109 the one expected from such an extrapolation . here",
    "we classify the 3c  273 knot a1 as the syn source , in accordance with marshall et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , although it should be emphazise that  in face of the detailed optical studies by jester et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 )  this particular choice already involves non - standard energy distribution of the radiating electrons .",
    "in the previous sections , we have followed `` conservative '' classification of the discussed sources based on their radio and x - ray emission properties .",
    "syn sources are mainly found as jet - knots in nearby low - luminosity radio galaxies in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "2001a , pesce et al .",
    "2001 , birkinshaw et al .",
    "if the magnetic field strength is not far from the equipartition value in these objects , the electrons must be accelerated very efficiently up to 10@xmath2100 tev , in accordance with the general expectation that radio galaxies may be one of the most efficient particle accelerators in the universe ( see a discussion in kataoka et al .",
    "if the electrons are actually accelerated to such high energies , the electrons emitting via synchrotron in the x - ray band have relatively short radiative life times .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time of the electrons can be expressed as    @xmath110}.\\ ] ]    since comptonization of the synchrotron photons , cmb photons and of the galactic photon fields also cool electrons ( what can be especially significant if the considered jets are relativistic on kpc scales ) , the above estimate would be an upper limit for the electron cooling time scale . indeed , stawarz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimated the energy density of the starlight emission at 1 kpc from the center of average elliptical galaxy  where typically the x - ray bright knots of the low - powerful jets are located  to be @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 erg @xmath114 . now , for the 25 fr i jet - knots classified as syn sources in this paper the median equipartition magnetic field computed for non - relativistic bulk velocities is @xmath64 = 130 @xmath7 g ( see table 2 ) , what gives the comoving energy density of the magnetic field @xmath115 = 6.7 @xmath20 10@xmath116 @xmath117 erg @xmath114",
    ". thus , the relative importance of the inverse - compton to synchrotron radiative losses for the electrons within the fr i jets is roughly    @xmath118    that is , radiating electrons within nearby fr i jets possessing x - ray ( and optical ) counterparts ( which are believed to be at least moderately beamed toward the observer , @xmath119 ) , cool mainly due to inverse - compton losses on the starlight photon fields of the host galaxies unless @xmath87 @xmath120 @xmath41 .",
    "hence , for the highest energy electrons in the fr i jets one can safely put the radiative cooling spatial scale @xmath121 @xmath104 100 pc . in general , this is consistent with the visual sizes of the jet - knots , but significantly smaller than the typical knots distances from the nucleus ( @xmath122 kpc in the case of fr i sources ) , and also than the typical inter - knot separation distances .",
    "therefore , the jet electrons have to be accelerated @xmath123 @xmath124 , most probably due to stochastic processes connected with strong turbulence occurring within those jets as a result of the mass entrainment from the surrounding medium ( de young 1986 )",
    ".    one can ask if in the case of the syn jet - knots in the nearby fr i galaxies magnetic field can be much smaller than the equipartition value .",
    "this possibility could be verified by means of detecting the inverse - compton radiation of the synchrotron - emitting electrons , which is expected to peak at high - energy @xmath72-ray band .",
    "interestingly , we can already put some meaningful limits on such high - energy component in the case of the m  87 jet .",
    "nearby radio galaxy m  87 was detected at tev photon energies by @xmath125 cherenkov telescope ( aharonian et al .",
    "2003 ) , and it was shown that the kpc - scale jet in this object can produce very high energy @xmath72-ray photons at the required level via comptonization of the starlight photon field ( stawarz et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , the latest non - detection of m  87 by @xmath126 telescope ( le bohec et al .",
    "2004 ) suggests variability of the discussed tev radiation , indicating that the kpc - scale jet in m  87 can not account for the @xmath125 signal .",
    "the implied upper limits indicate in turn that the magnetic field within the kpc - scale jet of m  87 radio galaxy can not be smaller than the equipartition value ( stawarz et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "thus , one can expect that also in the case of the other fr i jets @xmath87 @xmath122 @xmath41 .    for the ssc and ec sources ,",
    "a number of jet - knots seem extremely bright in the x - rays , as we have seen in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "this inevitably causes a large discrepancy between the `` expected '' and `` observed '' x - ray fluxes as we see in table 2 and @xmath8 3.5 , and what is again well known from the previous studies .",
    "one formal possibility is that equipartition hypothesis may not be valid in the considered jet - knots . for a given synchrotron luminosity @xmath127 @xmath60 @xmath43@xmath128 and for a given emitting region volume @xmath46 ,",

    "one finds that both the non - syn jet - knots and radio lobes are distributed around @xmath87@xmath6 1@xmath210@xmath7 g , whereas hotspots have a relatively narrow peak at higher field strength , @xmath87 @xmath6 50@xmath2300@xmath7 g , plus a `` tail '' extending down to @xmath112@xmath7 g . figure 6 shows the ratio of @xmath87 to the equipartition value .",
    "interestingly , @xmath87 in the lobe and most of the hotspots are almost consistent with the equipartition ( @xmath87/@xmath132 @xmath112 1 ) , whereas that of the non - syn jet - knots and of some of the hotspots is much weaker from what is expected ( @xmath87/@xmath133 @xmath112 0.01@xmath20.1 ) .",
    "( for @xmath44 = 1 ) and the equipartition value @xmath66 . ]    as an alternative idea , we also consider a case when the difference between the `` expected '' and `` observed '' x - ray fluxes is due to the relativistic beaming effect , and the minimum - power condition is fulfilled , as suggested by tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and celotti et al .",
    "relativistic beaming changes the observed x - ray luminosities significantly as @xmath18 @xmath60 @xmath84 for the ssc and @xmath60 @xmath99 for the ec ( equation ( 10 ) and ( 13 ) ) .",
    "deviation from equipartition may not be formally required so long as an appropriate beaming factor is assumed .",
    "the doppler factors thus calculated are shown in table 2 and figure 7 .",
    "one can see that the lobes and the hotspots exhibit relatively narrow distribution at @xmath44 @xmath112 1 , whereas for most of the jet - knots large beaming factors of @xmath112 10 are required , as noted before by many authors .",
    "we note , that the obtained @xmath44 @xmath112 0.1 for some of the hotspots is rather a formal possibility .",
    "figure 8 shows the distribution of equipartition magnetic field in the framework of relativistically moving jet model .",
    "similarly to figure 5 , we find again that the narrowly distributed strength of the magnetic field in the hotspots , @xmath87 @xmath112 100@xmath2500@xmath134 g , is an order of magnitude larger than that of the jet - knots and radio lobes .     for @xmath87 = @xmath41 .",
    "]        apparently , the above considerations imply that the inverse - compton x - ray emissions from the lobes and hotspots are relatively close to that expected from the magnetic field  radiating electrons energy equipartition , with at most mildly - relativistic bulk velocities of the radiating plasma .",
    "a number of jet - knots in powerful sources requires however significant bulk lorentz factor of @xmath4 @xmath38 @xmath44/2 @xmath112 5 to agree the inverse - compton origin of the x - ray photons with the minimum - power condition @xmath87 = @xmath41 .",
    "we note , that our evaluation gives the @xmath58 value of @xmath41 , as we set @xmath57 = @xmath47 in the equation ( 1 ) and @xmath65 in the subsequent analysis .",
    "therefore , any more realistic derivation would result in an even larger deviation from the energy equipartition , and thus in an even larger value for the jet doppler factor @xmath44 required to satisfy the minimum power condition .",
    "let us mention , that the alternative two - population synchrotron models do not require violation of the energy equipartition ( stawarz & ostrowski 2002 , dermer & atoyan 2004 ) .    usually , in applying the ec model to the quasar jet - knots x - ray emission , the idea of sub - equipartition magnetic field is rejected since it implies a very high kinetic power of the jets .",
    "for this reason , large values for the jet doppler factors are invoked .",
    "however , as discussed by , e.g. , atoyan & dermer ( 2004 ) , such an approach does not solve all the problems with the total energy requirements ( see also a discussion in stawarz 2004 ) .",
    "let us mention in this context another important issue .",
    "it is well known , that the @xmath135 studies of the large - scale jets in quasars and fr iis indicate that bulk lorentz factors of the radio - emitting plasma in these sources can not be much greater than @xmath4 @xmath112 3 ( wardle & aaron 1997 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between this result and the requirement of the minimum - power ec model for @xmath4 @xmath136 10 is typically ascribed to the jet radial velocity structure , namely that the radio emission originates within slower - moving jet boundary layer and the inverse - compton x - ray radiation is produced within the fast jet spine ( e.g. , ghisellini & celotti 2001 ) .",
    "while it is true that jet radial stratification can indeed significantly influence jet - counterjet brightness asymmetry ratio , one should be aware that by postulating different sites for the origin of radio and x - ray photons , homogeneous one - zone models for the broad - band knots emission can no longer be preserved .",
    "in particular , in such a case one has to specify exactly what fraction of the jet radio emission is produced within the spine and what fraction within the boundary layer , what is exactly the jet velocity radial profile , and what is the magnetic field strength in each jet components , etc .",
    "without such a discussion one can not simply use the observed radio flux of the jet to construct the broad - band spectral energy distribution of the knot region , i.e. simply estimate the expected inverse - compton flux by means of equipartition magnetic field derived from the radio observations . if one insists on applying the homogeneous one - zone model ( as a zero - order approximation ) , as presented in this paper , self - consistency requires a consideration of @xmath4 @xmath137 5 .",
    "in such a case , a departure from the minimum power conditions within the non - syn x - ray jets is @xmath138 .    accordingly to the discussion above , if the x - ray emission of the powerful jets is due to the ec process , these jets are most likely @xmath139 @xmath140 ( @xmath141@xmath120@xmath128 ) .",
    "the jet magnetic field must be then significantly amplified in the hotspot , where an approximate equipartition is expected to be reached . then the shocked plasma moves slowly to the radio lobe , where the equipartition field becomes close to the intergalactic value ( @xmath87@xmath112 a few @xmath7 g ) .",
    "let us comment in this context on the following issue .",
    "pressure of radio - emitting electrons within the lobes of quasars and fr iis computed from the equipartition condition is often found to be below the thermal pressure of the ambient medium ( hardcastle & worrall 2000 ) , what challenges the standard model for the evolution of powerful radio sources .",
    "such a discrepancy can be removed only by postulating deviations from the equipartition condition , or presence of non - radiating relativistic protons within the lobes .",
    "the presented analysis of the x - ray data confirms for a large number of sources the anticipated result that the magnetic field  radiating electrons energy equipartition within the lobes is generally fulfilled , and thus that the relativistic protons are very likely to constitute a significant fraction of the lobes non - thermal pressure .",
    "interestingly , this would mean that the total energy outputs of powerful jets are systematically @xmath142 from what is implied by the analysis of the lobes radio emission solely ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",
    "this , in turn , would be consistent with deviation from the minimum - power condition within the considered jets themselves .",
    "we note that viscous acceleration of cosmic rays taking place at the turbulent boundary layers of relativistic jets , discussed by , e.g. , ostrowski ( 2000 ) and rieger & mannheim ( 2002 ) , could provide energetically important flat - spectrum population of ultrarelativistic protons within the lobes of powerful radio sources .",
    "we have discussed two different versions of the ec model to account for extremely bright x - ray jet - knots : ( 1 ) non - equipartition case and ( 2 ) significant relativistic beaming case .",
    "both of these options are in many ways problematic .",
    "our next concern is to attempt to prove in general the postulated inverse - compton origin of the x - ray photons .",
    "note in this context , that for the ec sources the radio - to - x - ray flux ratio is proportional to @xmath80@xmath13@xmath143@xmath144 ( equation 12 ) .",
    "therefore , for a large sample of ec sources one should expect to observe @xmath30/@xmath31 @xmath60 @xmath143 behavior , if only @xmath87 and @xmath4 do not have large scatter from source - to - source ( cf . figures 5 and 7 ) .",
    "we therefore expect the high - redshift ec sources to be brighter in x - rays than nearby ec sources ( see schwartz 2002 , cheung 2004 ) .",
    "/@xmath29 , as a function of redshift for syn , ssc and ec soures . ]",
    "figure 9 shows the distribution of the flux ratio ( @xmath40/@xmath29 ) as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the dotted line shows @xmath60 @xmath143 relation which fits the highest @xmath10 data point ( gb  1508 + 5714 ; @xmath10 = 4.3 ) just to help guide the eyes . although data sample is still poor , we may say that no clear trend can be seen in this plot .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the discussed ratio is widely distributed even in the same objects . for example , in cases of knots in 4c  19.33 ( @xmath10 = 0.72 ) , `` conservatively '' classified as the ec sources , the x - ray - to - radio luminosity ratio changes of about an order of magnitude ( table 2 ) .",
    "such a difference is not easy to explain in the framework of model ( 1 ) , since we have to assume an order of magnitude increase in the magnetic fields along the jet . in a framework of relativistic beaming hypothesis ( 2 ) one",
    "may possibly explain such variation by postulating the decrease of the bulk lorentz factor along the flow and only moderate changes in magnetic field ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2004 ) . in this case , however , one has to explain what causes significant deceleration of the jet , which preserves its excellent collimation , with no significant radiative energy losses .",
    "we need more data obtained in various energy bands , and a more sophisticated analysis to conclude this further . however , we note that recent observations of high - redshift quasars by bassett et al .",
    "( 2004 ) did not reveal any evidence for the enhanced x - ray emission of the distant large - scale jets due to the increased energy density of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "since such an effect is expected in a framework of the ec model , one may conclude that the x - ray photons from the powerful quasar jets are not inverse - compton in origin .",
    "recent detailed re - analysis of the @xmath0 data for 3c  120 , again `` conservatively '' classified as an ec source , strongly support this idea ( harris et al .",

    "figure 10 shows the doppler beaming factor @xmath44 required in this model to obtain @xmath87 @xmath147 @xmath41 , versus the redshifts @xmath10 of the jet - knots classified here as the ec ones .",
    "one can clearly see a significant anticorrelation between @xmath44 and @xmath10 , meaning that the high-@xmath10 sources require much smaller @xmath44 for the magnetic field - radiating electrons energy equipartition than the sources located closer to the observer .",
    "@xmath146 ) constitutes the only exception from this trend .",
    "however , this peculiar source does not belong to the quasar class , and , in general , its x - ray emission is particularly problematic ( especially in a framework of the ec model ) .",
    "] there are two possible explanations for the noted @xmath44@xmath10 anticorrelation .",
    "if reflecting physical property , it would mean that the distant large - scale quasar jets are less relativistic than their nearby analogues but similarly close to the equipartition , @xmath148 that both low- and high-@xmath10 quasar jets are only mildly relativistic on large scales but closer to the minimum - power condition when located at large redshifts .",
    "none of this options appear to be particularly inartificial , especially as the high-@xmath10 quasar cores seem to be comparable to their low-@xmath10 counterparts ( e.g. , bassett et al .",
    "2004 ) . on the other hand , differences in velocity and energy content of the large - scale jets may not reflect differences in the central engines , but more likely differences in the surrounding galactic or intergalactic medium . the second possibility for understanding",
    "@xmath44@xmath10 anticorrelation is however that it is simply an artifact of the applied but inappropriate ec model .",
    "this issue has to be discussed carefully for a larger number of sources .",
    "we have studied the statistical properties of the large - scale jet - knots , hotspots and lobes in more than 40 radio galaxies recently observed with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for the jet - knots in nearby low - luminosity radio galaxies and for some of the hotspots , x - ray photons",
    "are most likely synchrotron in origin , being then produced by ultrarelativistic electrons with energies 10@xmath2100 tev that must be accelerated in situ . for the other objects x - ray photons are inverse - compton in origin , or , alternatively , are due to synchrotron emission of very high energy electrons with a non - standard energy distribution . in this paper",
    "we examine in more detail the former possibility .",
    "we first calculated the `` expected '' ssc or ec fluxes by assuming equipartition magnetic field and nonrelativistic velocity of the emitting plasma , and then compared them to the observed fluxes .",
    "we confirmed that the observed x - ray fluxes from the hotspots and radio lobes are approximately consistent with the expected ones , whereas a number of the jet - knots in powerful sources is too bright at x - rays .",
    "we examined two possibilities to account for this discrepancy in a framework of the inverse - compton model .",
    "the first idea is that equipartition hypothesis may not be valid for the considered sources . in this case , the x - ray bright jets are particle dominated and therefore far from the minimum - power condition",
    ". the jet magnetic field must be then significantly amplified in the hotspots where an approximate energy equipartition with the radiating particles is expected to be reached .",
    "an alternative idea is that the jets are highly relativistic ( @xmath4 @xmath38 5 ) even on kpc / mpc scales , but significantly decelerate in the hotspots .",
    "this however , in addition to other problems , challenges the homogeneous one - zone emission region model adopted in this paper , as discussed in the text .",
    "unfortunately , the comparison of the observed radio - to - x - ray flux ratios for various @xmath10 sources _ from the compiled dataset _ does not provide definite constraints on the x - ray emission process dominating within the quasar and fr ii jets .",

    "<S> this report will discuss the origin of their x - ray emissions and investigate the dynamics of the jets . </S>",
    "<S> the data was compiled at well sampled radio ( 5 ghz ) and x - ray frequencies ( 1kev ) for more than 40 radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we examined three models for the x - ray production : synchrotron ( syn ) , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and external compton on cmb photons ( ec ) . for the syn sources </S>",
    "<S>  mostly jet - knots in nearby low - luminosity radio galaxies  x - ray photons are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons with energies 10@xmath2100 tev that must be accelerated in situ . for the other objects , conservatively classified as ssc or ec sources , a simple formulation of calculating the `` expected '' x - ray fluxes under an equipartition hypothesis is presented . we confirmed that the observed x - ray fluxes are close to the expected ones for non - relativistic emitting plasma velocities in the case of radio lobes and majority of hotspots , whereas considerable fraction of jet - knots is too bright at x - rays to be explained in this way . </S>",
    "<S> we examined two possibilities to account for the discrepancy in a framework of the inverse - compton model : ( 1 ) magnetic field is much smaller than the equipartition value , and ( 2 ) the jets are highly relativistic on kpc / mpc scales </S>",
    "<S> . we concluded , that if the inverse - compton model is the case , the x - ray bright jet - knots are most likely far from the minimum - power condition . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the other possibility , namely that the observed x - ray emission from all of the jet - knots is synchrotron in origin . </S>"
