    "a watt balance virtually compares the mechanical and the electric powers produced by the motion of a mass in the earth gravitational field and by the motion of the supporting coil in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the vertical force acting on a coil linking the magnetic flux @xmath0 and carrying the electric current @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 indicates the derivative along the vertical .",
    "the electromotive force along the same coil moving vertically at velocity @xmath4 is @xmath5 . if @xmath6 counterbalances the weight @xmath7 of a mass in the gravitational field , by combining these equations and eliminating the geometric factor @xmath8 we obtain @xmath9 .",
    "this equation relates mechanical and electric powers and allows either @xmath10 to be determined in terms of electric quantities or the planck constant to be determined in terms of mechanical quantities @xcite .",
    "an assumption in this analysis is that no additional force acts on the coil .",
    "however , stray capacitances exist between the coil and the magnet and , since the electric current flowing in the coil originates a difference between the coil and magnet electric - potentials , electrostatic forces act on the coil .",
    "to support and to complement the watt - balance measurements of the planck constant , we extended previous investigations on the coil - field interaction @xcite by quantifying these forces .    in the experiments up to",
    "now completed , these forces have been implicitly assumed uninfluential , but , to our knowledge , no detailed study has been carried out to support this statement .",
    "owing to the extreme accuracy of the planck constant measurements , to gain confidence in the uncertainty of the no - effect statement , an equivalently accurate analysis is necessary .",
    "we have been also motivated by the spread  the order of magnitude of which is 100  nw / w , to be compared with a targeted uncertainty of 10  nw / w  of the planck constant values reported by the international avogadro coordination ( iac ) @xcite , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist - usa ) @xcite , the swiss federal office of metrology ( metas - switzerland ) @xcite , the national physical laboratory ( npl - uk ) @xcite , and the national research council ( nrc - canada ) @xcite .",
    "our study demonstrates that an accurate calculation of these minute forces is possible and that their effect is actually irrelevant , thus confirming the no - effect assumption .",
    "the analysis of a real watt balance system is hampered by its complexity .",
    "therefore , since we are not running any real experiment and , consequently , we have no pretension to completeness and to carry out an analysis of the error budget of a specific experiment , we cut the system design by limiting the investigation to the coil - magnet system and by turning to the model shown in fig .",
    "in particular , since incremental refinements might be endless , we focused on investigating if and how the electrostatic forces can be calculated accurately enough to exclude with certainty an effect in the watt balance operation .",
    "we made reference to the coil - magnet system of the metas watt balance ; dimensions were taken from @xcite .",
    "the sources of the magnetic field are two permanent magnets ( blue in fig .  [ toy ] ) placed on both sides of the kernel ( grey in fig .  [ toy ] ) with the same poles facing each other .",
    "the adjustment of the magnets to the kernel and the centring of the magnets - kernel assembly to the yoke is ensured by two bronze centring rings ( yellow in fig .",

    "[ toy ] ) and supported by six ceramic legs mounted on a hexagonal plate below and outside the magnetic circuit ( not shown in fig .  [ toy ] ) .    ) .",
    "the dashed box @xmath13 is the section of the torus used to calculate the forces acting on the coil ( brown - coloured ) .",
    "the coil dimensions are : inner radius 97  mm , outer radius 103  mm , height 21  mm .",
    "the height of the clamping rings ( green - coloured ) is 5  mm .",
    "the boundary conditions on the coil surface are shown in fig .",
    "[ toy ] ( right).,width=151 ]",
    "before carrying out a numerical analysis , we make an order - of - magnitude estimate of electrostatic force acting on the coil by using the lumped parameter model shown in fig .  [ coil ] .",
    "the stray capacitances between the coil and the magnet are modelled by a couple of capacitors , whose armatures are the inner and the outer coil - layers and the magnetic circuit .",
    "an approximate estimate of these capacitances is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the inner and outer radii of the armatures and @xmath17 is height of their overlapping parts .",
    "the current flowing in the coil originates a difference between the electric potentials of the coil and the magnet ; if a coil end is earthed , the potential of the opposite end is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the resistance and @xmath1 is the current .",
    "the electric potential of the coil surfaces varies as shown in fig .",
    "[ toy ] but , to carry out an order - of - magnitude calculation , we set the potentials of the inner and outer layers to the constant values of zero and @xmath20 , respectively .     and @xmath21 are the stray capacitances between the inner and outer coil - layers and the magnet .",
    "@xmath19 is the coil resistance.,width=283 ]    the vertical coordinate @xmath22 of the coil centre can be varied without loosing the validity of ( [ cylindrical ] ) ; therefore , the vertical force component is @xmath23 since @xmath24 if @xmath17 does not vary with @xmath22 , the inner capacitance does not contribute to @xmath25 . as regards as the outer capacitance , we must consider the parallel of the capacitances of the coil parts facing the pole shoe and yoke . by using @xmath26  @xmath12 , @xmath27  ma , @xmath28  mm , and @xmath29  mm ( pole shoe ) or @xmath30  mm ( yoke )",
    ", we obtain @xmath31  nn , if the coil is partially inside the magnetic gap , and @xmath32  nn , if it is entirely outside or inside the magnetic gap . when the coil is only slightly misplaced with respect to the central position , the force predicted by ( [ e - force ] ) is zero ; @xmath25 is not null only if the coil misplacement is so bad that it does not correspond to any real set - up . in this case , since a current of 7  ma generates a magnetic force of 5  n , the parasitic force would be about 6  nn / n , in relative terms .      the electrostatic force acting on the volume @xmath12 of an homogeneous medium is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distribution of the free charges , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the electric field and the electric displacement , respectively , @xmath37 const .  is the dielectric constant , and @xmath38 $ ] . here and in the following",
    "we represent vectors by column matrices , the superscript @xmath39 indicates the transpose , and the matrix product @xmath40 substitutes for the scalar product .    since numerical derivatives amplify the errors , in order to avoid the calculation of @xmath41 , it is convenient to represent the interaction between the charge distribution and the electric field by using the maxwell stress tensor @xcite . in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic medium , @xmath42 ,",
    "we can write @xmath43 , and @xmath44 because @xmath45 . next , by using the identity @xcite @xmath46 we can rewrite @xmath47 as @xmath48 by transposing ( [ prima ] ) , @xmath49therefore , @xmath50 where @xmath51is the maxwell s stress tensor and @xmath52 is the @xmath53 identity matrix .",
    "eventually , from the divergence theorem , the force and torque acting on the volume bounded by the surface @xmath13 are @xmath54 and @xmath55where @xmath56 is the position vector with respect to the pivot point and @xmath57 is the external unit - vector normal to integration surface .",
    "unfortunately , for the coil - magnet system , the @xmath58 discontinuity at the interfaces jeopardise the derivation of ( [ te0 ] ) and the usage of ( [ force]-@xmath16 ) to find the force acting on the coil can not be justified .",
    "therefore , in the next section , we briefly recall the theoretical framework necessary to validate the usage of ( [ force]-@xmath16 ) .      to find the electrostatic forces in an inhomogeneous medium is a quite complex problem .",
    "we refer to the solution given in @xcite , which is here outlined for the reader convenience .",
    "detailed and comprehensive treatments of the volume and surface forces and of the mechanical stresses in electrically polarised media can be also found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the local forces per unit volume acting on a continuous medium can be written in terms of the cauchy stress tensor @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the total force acting on a part of the medium having volume @xmath12 , @xmath61 can be reduced to the integration of the forces acting on its bounding surface @xmath13 , where @xmath57 is the unit outwards - vector normal to the surface element @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the total torque is @xmath63    in order to calculate the cauchy stress tensor , let us consider a deformation of the infinitesimal volume element @xmath64  where the @xmath22 axis is chosen locally parallel to @xmath35  consisting of an homogeneous isothermal virtual displacement of the top @xmath65-@xmath66 face by @xmath67 , with the electric potential unchanged .",
    "the medium inside the deformed volume exerts the @xmath68 force on the displaced face and the work done by this force , @xmath69 is opposite to the variation of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the the helmholtz free energy per unit volume , the thermodynamics variables are the temperature @xmath72 , density @xmath73 , and electric field @xmath35 , @xmath74 is the helmholtz free energy per unit volume when @xmath75 , @xmath58 is the dielectric constant of the medium , and the constitutive relationship @xmath42 and isotropy have been assumed . by carrying out the calculations of @xmath76",
    ", we obtain @xcite @xmath77 \\bi{n } .\\ ] ] for the sake of simplicity , when @xmath75 , we consider only the scalar part of the stress tensor , which is associated to the pressure @xmath78 and corresponds to model the medium as a fluid .",
    "hence , by using ( [ free ] ) in ( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath79 where @xmath80 is given by ( [ te ] ) and @xmath81 is the stress tensor in the absence of the electric field . with the fluid - medium approximation , @xmath82 ; but , if the @xmath58 anisotropy induced by elastic deformations is neglected , ( [ stress ] ) holds also in the general case .    in the absence of free charges and of temperature and density gradients , since @xmath83 and , consequently , @xmath84 , the condition of mechanical equilibrium is @xmath85 = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the force per unit volume , now represented by a row matrix .",
    "therefore , provided @xmath86 and @xmath87 on the surface , the total force and torque acting on @xmath12 , ( [ t : force ] ) and ( [ t : torque ] ) , can be calculated by using the maxwell stress tensor ( [ te ] ) .",
    "in fact , by virtue of ( [ equilibrium ] ) , the @xmath88 term in ( [ stress ] ) is a uniform pressure over the surface that makes no contributions .    because of the @xmath58 discontinuity ,",
    "when the integration surface is the interface between two media , this simplification is of no help and the cauchy stress tensor ( [ stress ] ) must be used in ( [ t : force ] ) and ( [ t : torque ] ) . however , provided that the body of interest is housed in an homogeneous medium , the calculation of ( [ t : force ] ) and ( [ t : torque ] ) can be still simplified by observing that , since @xmath89 is continuous through the surface , it does not matter if the cauchy stress tensor in the body ( [ stress ] ) or the maxwell stress tensor in the medium ( [ te ] ) are used .",
    "in addition , the integration surface can be any ; as long as it encloses the body , but not additional free charges .",
    "to calculate the maxwell stress tensor , we used a commercial finite element analysis software @xcite to solve numerically the laplace equation for an inhomogeneous medium , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the field potential in the coil - magnet gap  the cylindrical domain shown in fig .",
    "[ toy-2 ] . in ( [ field : eq ] ) , the dielectric constant is @xmath92  pf / m in the vacuum and @xmath93  pf / m in the ceramic rings .",
    "eventually , the electric field and displacement are @xmath94    dirichlet boundary conditions were specified on the domain boundaries . in particular ,",
    "@xmath95  v on the surface of the magnetic circuit whereas , owing to the electrical current and the relevant ohmic potential drops , the electric potential of the coil surface is assigned as shown in fig .",
    "[ toy ] . in the figure ,",
    "the current gets into the coil from the top - outer winding , which is set to the @xmath96 potential , and it gets out from the top - inner winding , which is set to the zero potential .",
    "the current reversal does not change the electrostatic interaction , but the grounding reversal  that is , the setting of the potential of the top - inner winding to @xmath96 and of the top - outer winding to zero potential  was also considered .",
    "the mesh , of about @xmath97 tetrahedral elements , was the result of successive refinements ; the relative numerical tolerance was set to @xmath98 .",
    "once the electric field has been calculated , the maxwell stress tensor was obtained by the application of ( [ te ] ) . to calculate the force acting on the coil , we integrated @xmath80 over the torus @xmath13  having rectangular cross - section and cutting midway the magnetic gap  shown in fig .",
    "[ toy-2 ] ; the @xmath35 value on @xmath13 was the external one - sided limit of the electric field .",

    "[ demo ] . in order to test the independence of @xmath25 on the integration surface ,",
    "the magnetic gap has been increased to 24  mm and three nested tori , enclosing the movable armature , have been accommodated in it . in figure",
    "[ demo ] , they are shown by dashed lines .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions were specified on the armature surfaces , where @xmath103  v , and on the inner and outer surfaces of the field domain , where @xmath104  v. on the top and bottom surfaces it was specified a zero charge , to ensure a field domain having open ends .",
    "the force was calculated by integrating @xmath80 over the each torus .",
    "the results are compared in fig .",
    "[ test ] ; they do not show appreciable differences .",
    "the finite element calculation smooths the sharp steps originated by the application of ( [ e - force ] ) , as expected .",
    "it also shows that ( [ e - force ] ) overestimates the maximum force .",
    "tests were also made to verify the influence of the sharpness of the domain boundaries , which was found negligible .",
    "the finite element software integrates @xmath80 by using both the ( internal and external to the integration surface ) one - sided limits of the electric field .",
    "the relevant force values are given in table [ table : demo ] : owing to the @xmath35 continuity , they are expected to be the same .",

    "the torque about the coil centre is @xmath111  pn  m/@xmath11 m ; this value indicates that the centre of application of the force is 0.17  mm above the centre .",
    "the watt balance operation requires that no external force acts on the coil , apart from that due to the interaction between the electric current and the magnetic field .",
    "however , since the coil resistance raises the coil potential with respect to that of the magnet , stray capacitances induce electrostatic forces .",
    "the metas watt balance having been taken as a starting point of our simplified model , we reported about a finite element analysis aimed at quantifying these electrostatic interactions . up to now",
    ", these forces have been assumed irrelevant .",
    "our study shows that a finite element analysis has adequate accuracy for investigating their effect and that the no - effect assumption was indeed correct .",
    "stray capacitances affect also the moving - mode operation : charge and discharge currents induced by the capacitance variations influence the measured voltage between the coils ends .",
    "furthermore , the electrostatic forces acting on the moving coil can induce unwanted velocity components .",
    "these effects should be negligible , but they deserve future investigations nevertheless .    the magnetic equivalent of the electrostatic forces is related to the coil inductance and displays itself as a dependence of the magnetic field on the coil current and position .",
    "since it is embedded in a detailed calculation of the magnetic forces acting on the coil , the calculation of the relevant parasitic forces requires a huge effort both from the theoretical and numerical viewpoints .",
    "it is a complex magnetostatic problem that includes the simulation of the permanent magnet , of the magnetic circuit , and of their response to the coil current .",
    "once the field in the magnetic gap is on hand , one can proceed by evaluating the relevant the maxwell stress tensor and by integrating it over a closed surface embedding the coil .",
    "this paper outlined , in a much simpler framework , the general strategy to cope with this problem .",
    "to help the metrologists performing watt - balance experiments , we summarise here the main results of our investigation . by symmetry reasons and by neglecting the potential gradients on the coil surface , no electrostatic force acts on a coaxial coil placed in the magnet centre . from the electrostatic viewpoint , this is a stable equilibrium point with respect to vertical displacements and an unstable equilibrium point with respect to horizontal displacements .",
    "when misplacements are considered once at a time , the elastic constants are @xmath108  pn / mm ( vertical ) and 0.66  nn/@xmath11 m ( radial ) .",
    "the potential gradients make the application point of this elastic force misplacement about 0.17  mm above the coil centre .",
    "the vertical elastic constant is so small that , also in the case of a millimetre misplacement , the relevant bias can be neglected .",
    "the effect of the force and torque component in the horizontal plane , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , can be examined as follows . as long as the magnetic force and mass weight are coaxial and",
    "pass through the coil centre of mass , there is no need for the coil to be in a given position .",
    "therefore , if the balance is so aligned as to make it insensitive to the exchange of the mass weight for the coil force , we can assume that @xmath112 and @xmath113 are counteracted by opposite magnetic force and torque nullifying them and making the total force vertical and passing through the coil centre .",
    "in this case , the relevant measurement equation is @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the radial components of the velocity and angular - velocity , respectively , @xmath117  n and , in the case of 1  mm offset between the field and coil axes , @xmath118 and @xmath119  m. therefore , the relevant constraint on the coil motion are irrelevant .",
    "in addition , it must be noted that the weighing is carried out by offsetting the balance by 0.5  kg and by adding the magnetic forces generated by equal and opposite currents in the coil with the 1  kg mass on and off the pan .",
    "therefore , provided that the coil grounding is not changed in the current reversal , the electrostatic contribution to the total force cancels in the sum .",
    "design expedients to remove the electrostatic forces also exist .",
    "the filling of the magnetic gap with a non - magnetic metal to create a toroidal cavity of rectangular cross section increases the system symmetry thus reducing the vertical force - component .",
    "a second solution is to add an electrostatic shield around the coil , e.g. , by winding a additional single - layer coils which are earthed at one point .",
