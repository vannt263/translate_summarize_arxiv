    "the deflection of light in a gravitational field predicted by the general theory of relativity witnessed experimental verification in 1919 .",
    "the spectacular phenomena resulting from the deflection of light in a gravitational field are referred to as the gravitational lensing ( gl ) .",
    "chwolson , in 1924 , pointed out that if a background star ( source ) , a deflector ( gravitational lens ) and an observer are perfectly aligned , a ring - shaped image of the source centered on the deflector would appear ( see in schneider et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this is , however , usually called as the ` einstein ring ' .",
    "einstein ( 1936 ) obtained the apparent luminosities of the images of a star ( source ) due to a foreground star ( gravitational lens ) .",
    "he mentioned that if the source , the lens and the observer are sufficiently aligned , the images will be highly magnified .",
    "however , arguing that the angular image splitting caused by a stellar - mass lens is too small to be resolved by an optical telescope , and we shall scarcely ever approach close enough to an alignment with the source and the deflector , he remarked that there is a little chance to observe lensing phenomena caused by stellar - mass lenses .",
    "though several authors ( eddington 1920 , chwolson 1924 ) discussed that the deflection of light in a gravitational field may give rise to gl , only zwicky ( 1937a , b ) expressed his vision clearly that the observation of the gl phenomena would be a certainty .",
    "the studies of gl remained in almost a dormant stage until klimov , liebes and refsdal independently re - opened this subject with their pioneering work in 1960 s .",
    "klimov ( 1963 ) investigated the lensing of galaxies by galaxies , whereas liebes ( 1964 ) studied lensing of stars by stars and also stars by globular clusters in our galaxy .",
    "refsdal ( 1964a , b ) was the first to argue that the geometrical optics can be used in studying the properties of point - mass gravitational lenses and the time delay resulting from the lensing phenomena .",
    "a quasar is an ideal source for gl because of its high luminosity , point - like appearance , prominent spectral features and the large distance from the earth ( high probability of deflectors intervening the source and the observer ) .",
    "the great vision of zwicky became true when walsh , carswell and weymann discovered the first example of the gl - the qso 0957 + 561 a , b ( walsh et al .",
    "the two images of a single qso were separated by six @xmath0 .",
    "both images had similar optical spectra , a galaxy was found between the images , the flux ratio between images was found to be the same in the optical as well as in the radio wavebands , and vlbi observations showed detailed correspondence between various knots in the two radio images ( cf .",
    "narasimha et al .",
    "1984 , narayan and bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "the vlbi features were modelled by narasimha et al .",
    "( 1984 ) who demonstrated that a cluster in addition to the giant elliptical was needed for producing the observed features . following this landmark discovery , more than a dozen confirmed examples of multiply- imaged quasars are known and , in addition , six ring - shaped radio images have been found ( refsdal and surdej 1994 , keeton and kochanek 1995 ) .",
    "the einstein rings for extended sources were predicted by saslaw et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and were first discovered by hewitt et al .",
    "the detection of new lensing phenomena , namely giant luminous arcs and arclets , and microlensing events have increased dramatically in recent years . for a review on giant luminous arcs and arclets see fort and miller(1994 ) and on microlensing see narasimha ( 1995 ) and roulet and mollerch ( 1997 ) .",
    "cheng and refsdal ( 1979 , 1984 ) as well as subramanian et al . ( 1985 ) developed the theory of microlensing to explain the flux variability in the images . the traditional dynamical method to obtain masses of celestial bodies in the universe requires that the system under investigation is in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "therefore , this method has limitation in its use .",
    "however , there are no such restrictions to the use of gl and therefore , in recent years , it has become the most important tool for probing the universe .",
    "indeed narasimha and chitre ( 1989 ) predicted that dark extended massive objects could act as lenses for systems like 2345 + 007 , mg 2016 + 112 etc . which was confirmed with the discovery of a dark but x - ray bright cluster at redshift of 1 in the system mg 2016 + 112 by hattori et al .",
    "narasimha ( 1994 ) discussed the gravitational lens as a probe of dark matter in the universe .",
    "the gl can give important informations on masses of galaxies , the composition of dark matter , cosmological parameters , existence of exotic massive objects , the large scale structure of the universe and can be also used to test the alternative theories of gravitation .",
    "a gravitational lens provides a highly magnified view of the distant objects in the universe and therefore acts as a cosmic telescope .",
    "since the last decade the gl has become one of the most important research fields in cosmology ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 , refsdal and surdej 1994 , narayan and bartelmann 1996 , wu 1996 ) .",
    "the gl is very likely to serve an important tool to detect exotic objects in the universe , such as cosmic strings and there have been attempts to investigate if any of the confirmed gravitational lenses could be due to the action of cosmic strings ( see hogan and narayan 1984 , vilenkin 1984 , 1986 , gott 1985 , de laix and vachaspati 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "there is no compelling evidence that any of the observed gravitational lenses are due to a cosmic string .",
    "however , it is essential to develop new gravitational lens models with objects which are though not yet observed , are not forbidden on theoretical grounds .",
    "it is well - known that the scalar fields have been conjectured ( since before the outset of the general theory of relativity ) to give rise to the long - range gravitational fields , and several theories involving scalar fields have been proposed ( see abraham 1914 , bergmann 1956 , brans and dicke 1961 , callan et al .",
    "1970 , garfinkle et al . 1991 , 1992 ,",
    "yilmaz 1992 , horne and horowitz 1992 , 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the scalar fields minimally as well as conformally coupled to gravitation have been a subject of active theoretical research . in recent years",
    ", there is a growing interest in the studies of scalar ( dilaton ) fields , because of their importance in string theories .",
    "there have been a number of studies of light propagation in the unconventional scalar - tensor theories of gravity ( sanders 1989 , bekenstein and sanders 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the problem of formation of critical curves and consequent appearance of multiple images has not received adequate attention . in the present paper",
    "we study the effects of the massless scalar field on the schwarzschild lensing .",
    "more precisely , we build a new static and circularly symmetric singular lens model characterized by two parameters : the schwarzschild mass and the `` scalar charge '' .",
    "for this purpose we take the most general static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat exact solution to the einstein - massless scalar ( ems ) equations , given by janis , newman and winicour ( jnw ) ( janis et al .",
    "wyman ( 1981 ) obtained a static spherically symmetric exact solution to the ems equations and later roberts ( 1993 ) showed that the most general static spherically symmetric solution to the ems equations ( with zero cosmological constant ) is asymptotically flat and this is the wyman solution . the wyman solution is well considered in the literature .",
    "recently one of us ( virbhadra 1997 ) showed that the wyman solution is the same as the jnw solution , which was obtained about thirteen years ago , we therefore call it the jnw solution . switching off the `` scalar charge '' in this solution one",
    "recovers the well - known schwarzschild solution .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to the new lens model as the schwarzschild - massless scalar ( sms ) lens . for small values of the ratio of the `` scalar charge '' to the schwarzschild mass",
    ", the sms lensing does not have any new qualitative ( though differs quantitatively ) features and resembles the schwarzschild lensing phenomena .",
    "however , for reasonably large value of this ratio , the einstein deflection angle starts with a negative value , becomes positive , reaches a maximum and then decreases to zero as the closest distance of approach increases from a small value to the infinity .",
    "this behaviour of the sms lens gives rise to few interesting features , for instance , it gives radial critical curves ( radial caustics in the source plane ) and concentric einstein double rings ( tangential caustics in the source plane ) .",
    "these effects are not found in any of the known singular lens models .",
    "moreover , the number of images also differs from the case of the schwarzschild lensing .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the jnw solution has a strong curvature globally naked singularity ( virbhadra et al .",
    "it is not known how one would be able to distinguish observationally black holes from naked singularities ( if these exist ) .",
    "our present investigations reveal the qualitative different features and consequently the results we present here could be useful in differentiating between the two kinds of objects .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , we derive the einstein deflection angle for a general static and spherically symmetric metric , which generalizes the result obtained by weinberg ( 1972 ) . sect .",

    "we now discuss the jnw solution in order to derive the einstein deflection angle for the jnw metric . the einstein - massless scalar equations ( ems ) are r_ij  -  r  g_ij  =  8  s_ij  , where @xmath15 , the energy - momentum tensor of the massless scalar field , is given by s_ij  =  _ , i  _ , j  -  g_ij  g^ab  _ , a _ , b  , and _ , i^  ; i  =  0 .",

    "3 . the observations of double einstein rings near the centres of relativistic star clusters in galactic nuclei could be a powerful probe of `` scalar charge '' .",
    "the most important property of such a configuration useful for the diagnostic of the lens is the formation of four images of a background radio source located at about an arcsecond from the line of sight to the centre of the lens .",
    "two of the images will be at opposite sides of the lens and will be bright , but the other two images ( one on each side of the lens ) will be generally faint . for a source sufficiently away from the optic axis , two images will be formed , _ both in the same side of the lens _ unlike the normal mass distribution acting as lens .",
    "the present vlba and vlbi are capable of detecting the radio images at milliarcseconds and inferring from the spectral characteristics that they could indeed be images of the same background object .",
    "the ellipticity of the mass distribution in the lens could alter the image configuration .",

    "if these features should turn out to be present , it could provide a means to determine the relative gravitational influence of the `` scalar charge '' q and mass m in the lens .",
    "our results become important if the following observations yield positive results : observations of relativistic star clusters in galactic nuclei should show evidence for double ring structure or four images of a background source along a line or two images in the same side of the lens with no evidence for a third image in the other side .",
    "these results , if found to be true , will strongly argue in favour of existence of `` scalar charges '' in the universe .",
    "the gravitational lens can serve as a very useful tool to discover exotic objects in the universe ( described by matter fields which are not detected , as yet ) as well as to test alternative theories of gravity . even before the advent of the general theory of relativity ,",
    "scalar fields have been proposed to simulate the long - range gravitational fields and it still continues ( see in horne and horowitz 1992 , yilmaz 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "bekenstein and sanders ( 1994 ) discussed that gravitational lenses in scalar - tensor theories could be divergent under some circumstances .",
    "we studied the null geodesics in a general static spherically symmetric spacetime and calculated the einstein deflection angle .",
    "the deflection angle for a general static spherically symmetric metric obtained in this work can be used to construct circular gravitational lens models ( with different matter fields ) in the einstein theory as well as in alternative theories of gravity .",
    "we have used this result to study a circularly symmetric gravitational lens in the einstein - massless scalar theory , by considering the most general static and spherically symmetric solution , given by janis et al .",
    "this describes the exterior field due a spherically symmetric massive object endowed with `` scalar charge '' .",
    "the same field also describes the spacetime due to a naked singularity .",
    "though the existence of a naked singularity is debatable , this subject has recently attracted the attention of many researchers minds ( see virbhadra et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "it is not altogether clear how one would be able to distinguish observationally a black hole from a naked singularity ( if indeed these exist ) .",
    "we propose that the present lens model could be helpful for this purpose .",
    "the new schwarzschild - massless scalar gravitational lens has interesting features which are not shared by other known circularly symmetric gravitational lenses . for `` small '' values of the `` scalar charge '' to the mass ratio",
    "the lensing is qualitatively similar ( but quantitatively different ) to the schwarzschild lens . for these cases , like the schwarzschild lens , there are two images of opposite parities ( one on each side of the optic axis ) , there exits no radial critical curve , and there is only the einstein ring .",
    "the `` scalar charge '' contributes to the decrease in the radius of the einstein ring .",
    "when the `` scalar charge '' to the mass ratio is not small , the gravitational lens action is quite different from the schwarzschild lensing . when this ratio is `` very large '' ( for example , @xmath145 ) one gets two images of opposite parities on _ the same side of the source _ or nil depending upon the source position .",
    "there exists one radial critical curve and no tangential critical curve ( no einstein ring ) in this case .",
    "however , for `` large '' ratio cases there are four images ( two on each side of the optic axis ) or two on the same side of the source , depending upon the location of source .",
    "there exist two tangential critical curves ( _ double einstein rings _ ) and one radial critical curve which lies in between them . one interesting feature of these cases ( `` very large '' as well as `` large '' ratio ) is that one can get images of positive parity and sometimes large magnification at smaller angles compared to the source position , cf",

    "an image which forms at smaller angular position compared to its source position are usually demagnified , unless it is close to a critical curve . thus , under some situations one can get magnified image at smaller angular position compared to its source position .",

    "<S> the gravitational lensing is qualitatively similar to the case of the schwarzschild lens ; however , for large values of this ratio the lensing characteristics are significantly different . </S>",
    "<S> the main features are the existence of two or nil einstein ring(s ) and a radial critical curve , formation of two or four images and possibility of detecting three images near the lens for sources located at relatively large angular positions . </S>",
    "<S> such a novel lens may also be treated as a naked singularity lens .    </S>"
