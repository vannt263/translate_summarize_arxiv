    "the origin and evolution of r - process elements is one of the hottest research areas .",
    "the detection of a near - infrared light bump in the afterglow of a short - duration @xmath4-ray burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has initiated the current understanding that a neutron star ( ns ) merger is a promising major site for r - process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two vigorous and successful research activities in particular have supported this understanding ; one is r - process nucleosynthesis calculations in ns mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the other is modeling galactic chemical evolution of r - process elements in terms of the enrichment taking place through ns mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the abovementioned studies , the features of observed stellar abundances in nearby dwarf galaxies present more direct evidences for ns mergers as the site for r - process .",
    "the properties characterizing ns merger events are their rarity and high yield of r - process elements per event . @xcite",
    "have found that faint classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) exhibit a constant [ eu / h ] of @xmath5 over the metallicity range of @xmath6@xmath7 , which implies no eu production events while more than @xmath8 core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) increase the galactic fe abundance . if ccsne are associated with r - process production , a gradual increase in [ eu / h ] by @xmath1 0.35 to 1 dex is predicted for this [ fe / h ] range , depending on the theoretical eu yield from a ccsn @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite have discovered in an ultra - faint dwarf galaxy , reticulum ii , a feature suggesting that a single event with an r - process yield as high as the amount expected from an ns merger remarkably enhances r - process abundances of this galaxy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    apart from capture of electromagnetic waves",
    ", we can assess the r - process site and properties by analysis of meteoritic abundances of r - process elements .",
    "in particular , abundances of short - lived radioactive nuclei , such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 , produced by the r - process inside meteorites have been known to be used as a clock to measure the time interval , @xmath11 , between the last r - process production event and solar system formation since the 1960 s @xcite . from the timescale thus obtained , we can infer the rarity of r - process events . according to many reports ,",
    "a relatively long timescale of @xmath12100 myr is deduced ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see  2.1 ) . on the other hand , meteoritic abundances of radionuclides such as @xmath13 ( half - life :",
    "1.03 myr ) and @xmath14 ( half - life :  2.2 myr ) imply the injection from a nearby ccsn since their abundances are higher than the steady - state abundance inferred from @xmath4-ray observations and galactic chemical evolution @xcite .",
    "thus , we anticipate that r - process production events may occur much less frequently than ccsne .",
    "a recent finding of the current low abundance of @xmath10 in deep sea reservoirs highlights the rarity of r - process events @xcite .",
    "it was found that the current abundance is lower than expected from continuous production in ccsne by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "this current abundance together with that in the early solar system ( ess ) indeed gives a piece of evidence for the chemical evolution of @xmath10 in the solar vicinity , which is found to support the rarity of r - process events that is compatible with an ns merger frequency @xcite .",
    "besides , @xmath10 abundance could trace the local star formation history with a rigid time - resolution since its short half - life of 81 myr should make its abundance sensitive to the star formation rate ( sfr ) in individual epochs . on the other hand , the local sfr(@xmath15 ) has been well studied by several methods of age - dating of stars @xcite .",
    "these studies have established our current understanding that the local sfr(@xmath15 ) is not constant : it is oscillatory @xcite or has a few bursting star formation events @xcite that will significantly impact @xmath10 time evolution .",
    "a new angle to analyze meteoritic abundances of r - nuclides provides key information on the history of r - process enrichment .",
    "while abundances of short - lived radioactive r - nuclides essentially reflect only the last r - process event , abundances of stable r - nuclides reflect the cumulation of all r - process events till the ess .",
    "thus , combining the two pieces of information will lead to counting of the total number of events that contribute to the local r - process enrichment . in this _",
    "letter _ , we present @xmath10 time evolution by combining analysis results of meteoritic abundances (  2 ) with the observed local star formation history (  3 ) .",
    "our study further explores the deduction of the properties of r - process production , i.e. , its frequency and its propagation , both of which are of great significance but remain unsolved issues (  4 ) .",
    "we start by extracting the information on local r - process enrichment in the ess from analysis of meteoritic abundances .",
    "we estimate the following three parameters ; ( i ) how much a single r - process event enriches the fraction of a particular r - nuclide in the surrounding interstellar matter ( ism ) per volume , ( ii ) how many times r - process events occur locally and enrich the ism from the initial star formation till the ess , and ( iii ) when does the last r - process event occur before the ess . for this purpose , we need two types of r - nuclides : short - lived radioactive r - nuclide and stable r - nuclide . in our analysis , we adopt @xmath10 ( half - life : 81 myr ) , which is present in the form of fissiogenic xenon isotopes , as the former and eu as the latter .",
    "meteoritic abundances of short - lived radioactive r - nuclides are dominated by the nuclides ejected from the last r - process production event as long as the time interval between r - process events is much longer than half - lives of the r - nuclides . @xmath10 along with other r - nuclides such as @xmath16 and @xmath9 meets this condition . from this fact",
    ", we will deduce how much a single r - process event enriches the surrounding ism with r - nuclides .",
    "first , we deduce the mass fraction of @xmath10 at the ess .",
    "the number fraction of @xmath17u relative to hydrogen at the ess is estimated to be @xmath18 from meteorites , considering the radioactive decay ( half - life : 4.47 gyr ) till the present over 4.56 gyr @xcite .",
    "then from the abundance of @xmath0pu relative to @xmath17u ( 0.008 ) at the ess @xcite and a typical number density of hydrogen in the ism ( 1 @xmath19 ) , the number density of @xmath0pu at the ess is deduced to be @xmath20 @xmath19 with the corresponding mass fraction of @xmath21 .",
    "the amount of @xmath0pu thus obtained includes small contributions from a few events before the last one . by removing these small contributions ,",
    "we obtain how much a single r - process event polluted the ism with @xmath0pu at the ess . for this estimate ,",
    "two timescales are required .",
    "one is the time interval @xmath11 between the last r - process event and solar system formation .",
    "the other is the mean time interval @xmath22 between individual r - process events before the ess epoch .",
    "@xmath11 is necessary to know the remaining fraction of @xmath0pu owing to a radioactive decay from the last r - process event .",
    "this together with @xmath22 gives the contributing fraction from prior events to meteoritic @xmath0pu abundance .",
    "@xmath11 is deduced from the comparison of the ratio of unstable to stable r - process isotopes between meteoritic abundances and the theoretical production yields .",
    "since @xmath11 critically depends on the assumed production ratio , we need several combinations of unstable / stable isotopes to make an independent estimate of @xmath11 .",
    "for instance , the useful isotope combinations are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 where the unstable isotopes have half - lives of @xmath26yr , @xmath27yr , and @xmath28yr , respectively . from @xmath25 and @xmath24 , a relatively long interval of @xmath12 100 myr",
    "is obtained @xcite .",
    "more recently , using the latest nucleosynthesis results of @xmath9 and @xmath29 , @xcite deduce @xmath30109 myr together with @xmath30123 myr from @xmath23 .",
    "though the value of @xmath11 thus obtained should be revised as will be discussed in  2.3 , we here adopt @xmath30120 myr as an initial input . in addition , we assume @xmath22=200 myr , which will yield the adopted @xmath11 as one of the plausible cases .    from @xmath30120 myr , the remaining fraction of @xmath10 from the last event at the ess is estimated to be 35.8% .",
    "then , from both @xmath30120 myr and @xmath22=200 myr , we deduce that the fraction of @xmath10 from the last event with respect to the total @xmath10 in meteoritic abundance is 82% , which is confirmed to be a large fraction as expected .",
    "these values combined with the prior estimate of @xmath21 results in @xmath31 as the mass fraction of @xmath10 in the ism yielded from an injection by a single r - process event .",
    "next , we relate the above @xmath10 mass fraction to that of stable eu nuclei by introducing the theoretical production ratio between the two nuclei .",
    "production of radioactive r - nuclides such as th , u , and pu is investigated by @xcite , and according to their latest nucleosynthesis results @xcite , the updated production ratio for @xmath10/@xmath32 is 0.33 .",
    "this value is identical to other estimates by @xcite ( = 0.4 ) and @xcite ( = 0.33 ) .    on the other hand , regarding the existing r - nuclides in meteorites ( or solar photosphere )",
    ", we anticipate that the production pattern follows the solar r - process pattern .",
    "this hypothesis is justified by the observation that galactic metal - poor halo stars exhibit the universality of r - process abundance distribution for heavy r - nuclides , which matches the solar r - process pattern ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accordingly , the relative production ratio for @xmath32/eu is inferred from their solar r - process ratio corrected by the radioactive decay for @xmath32 ( eu : 0.0984 , @xmath33u : 0.018 ( atoms/@xmath34 si ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as by a 3% contribution to eu from s - process .",
    "the mass ratio is found to be 0.2955 .",
    "this together with @xmath10/@xmath32=0.33 results in @xmath10/eu=0.097 .",
    "then we finally obtain the value of eu mass fraction due to enrichment by a single r - process event as @xmath35 .",
    "the solar r - process abundance of eu , @xmath36 , is the end result of cumulation of eu by individual r - process events in the solar vicinity till the ess .",
    "thus , using the enrichment caused by each event , we can count the total number of events till the ess . dividing @xmath36 by @xmath35",
    ", we obtain the total number of r - process events till the ess as @xmath118 . here",
    "we ignore the mixing process of the ism on the @xmath1100 myr timescale , which may allow eu atoms to move into and out of the ism yielding the solar system over @xmath17.5 gyr .",
    "simulations of r - process enrichment combined with hydrodynamics of the ism in the galaxy are indeed awaited .",
    "since the total number @xmath37 of r - process event determines the abundances of stable r - nuclei at the ess , @xmath11 is largely influenced by @xmath37 .",
    "this is understood from the abundance ratio @xmath38 of a radioactive isotope to a stable isotope after the last event inside meteorites , which is given by the following equation @xcite ; @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the production ratio of each single event and @xmath41 is the mean lifetime ( = half - life/@xmath42 ) of a radioactive isotope .",
    "thus , @xmath11 should be updated with our result . to calculate @xmath11 , we need to assume @xmath22 for the period of 1 gyr before the ess in addition to @xmath37 . then incorporating @xmath37=18 with @xmath22=200 myr before the ess into calculations , we deduce @xmath11=137 , 139 , and 145 myr from @xmath24 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "accordingly we here adopt @xmath11=140 myr .",
    "this revised @xmath11 modifies the prior @xmath10 remaining fraction of the last event in meteorites from 0.358 to 0.302",
    ". then the resultant mass fractions of @xmath10 and eu by one r - process event are slightly modified to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "these new values result in @xmath45 15 .",
    "hereafter we adopt @xmath37=15 , though this value can be improved further as there are still uncertainties in @xmath11 and @xmath22 . a further update of @xmath11 will be done with a variable @xmath22 in the next section .",
    "= 12@xmath215 gyr is equally redistributed to individual bins for the time interval @xmath15=10@xmath212 gyr to achieve compatibility between galactic age and cosmic age .",
    ", width=321 ]    incorporating the total number of r - process events till the ess into the observed local star formation ( sf ) history , we calculate the evolution of @xmath10 density of the solar neighborhood over the entire period up to the present .",
    "our approach has two steps : ( i ) we integrate the sfr from the beginning of the galaxy to the time of ess and bin by the inferred number of contributing r - process events during that time , and ( ii ) we integrate the sfr forward from the ess time to the present , and at any time that the integrated number of newly formed stars reaches the threshold number , @xmath0pu is ejected into the ism .",
    "we utilize the two observed sf histories obtained by @xcite and @xcite because these two papers try to give the whole sf history while others limit it to the recent gyrs .",
    "their results are shown by red and blue lines , respectively , in figure 1 . applying the above procedures to the sf histories , we find that each sf history results in 26 and 31 events of r - process production in total",
    ". then from the assigned individual r - process events as a function of time , we calculate the time evolution of @xmath10 density in the ism ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "owing to the observed tendency that the sfr during the recent 2 gyr is relatively low compared with at that over 2@xmath25 ( 6 ) gyr ago including the ess epoch , @xmath22 changes from @xmath46 myr around at the ess to @xmath47 myr at the current time .",
    "a relatively lower sfr in recent times is also deduced from white dwarf cosmochronology @xcite . since the oscillatory lowest level of @xmath10 density",
    "is determined by the length of @xmath22 , the recent long @xmath22 makes the @xmath10 density drop to the value as low as the measurement in ocean archives @xcite during the last 2 gyr .",
    "the time interval of the latest r - process event inferred from the @xmath10 density measured in ocean sediments is 360 myr .",
    "if we assume the sfr prior to the ess time , a poisson distribution of r - process events gives a no - event probability of 0.2 within the time interval . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed current low sfr lifts the probability to 0.4 and further to 0.65 for the upper limit of the sediment abundance .",
    "pu number density in the ism of the solar vicinity .",
    "the different colored lines correspond to the results combined with the star formation history shown by the same color in fig .  1 . the current measurement values estimated from deep sea archives @xcite",
    "are shown with error bars .",
    "the level of @xmath0pu density at the ess is denoted by the shaded stripe .",
    "the initial @xmath0pu density by a single r - process event is also indicated . , width=321 ]    in addition , from our predicted @xmath10 evolution , we deduce @xmath11 with a variable @xmath22 , which is calculated based on the sfr-@xmath15 relation in fig .",
    ", we eventually obtain @xmath11=130 myr from the sf history of @xcite and 140 myr from that of @xcite .",
    "this longer value of @xmath11 compared with the values thus far is mainly caused by the small @xmath37 till the ess , which results in a high initial @xmath0pu/@xmath33u ratio at the last r - process event owing to a low @xmath33u abundance that reflects the cumulation of the past r - process events .",
    "by comparing the deduced @xmath0pu density ejected in the ism by a single r - process event with the @xmath0pu nucleosynthesis yield from a r - process site , we can estimate how much the ism will be eventually mixed with the ejecta carrying r - process elements . considering the implied rarity of frequency as a countable number of @xmath130 events over the period of 12 gyr in the solar vicinity together with a detailed discussion in a previous work @xcite , the r - process production site can be reasonably identified with an ns merger .",
    "then , we assume a typical ejecta mass of an ns merger of 0.01 and individual element production obeying the solar r - process pattern .",
    "in addition , we assume that light r - process elements such as sr , y , and zr ( @xmath48 ) are not synthesized in an ns merger from an implication of elemental feature among galactic halo stars ( * ? ? ? * see also monte et al .",
    "according to the calculations claiming the production of @xmath49130 by an ns merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we set the lower boundary at @xmath49=127 since the discussion based on the last r - process event ( see  2.1 ) suggests that the production site of iodine is the same as that of heavier r - nuclei such as pu .    the above hypotheses together with the radio - decay correction give the @xmath33u mass fraction inside the ejecta of 2.55@xmath50 .",
    "then from @xmath10/@xmath32=0.33 , the mass fraction of @xmath0pu is estimated to be 8.42@xmath51 , which is equivalent to a mass of 8.42@xmath52 in the ejecta with a mass of 0.01 . combining this",
    "ejected mass of @xmath0pu with its resultant density in the ism , the mass of ism mixed with the r - process ejecta is deduced to be 8.42@xmath52/@xmath53 .",
    "it turns out that the mass mixed with the ejecta of an ns merger that expands with a velocity of 10% to 30% of the speed of light is much larger than that swept - up by an sn of @xmath54@xcite . the corresponding radius of the cylindrical disk is found to be 370 pc , assuming a local surface density of gas ( hi + h@xmath55 ) of 8 pc@xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the timescale to pervade the ism could be as short as on the order of myr @xcite and thus negligible .      utilizing the result on the propagation of r - process ejecta",
    ", we can deduce the event frequency of r - process production with respect to the occurrence number of ccsne . the current time interval between r - process production events",
    "is found to be about 400 myr .",
    "thus , it turns out that the total number of ccsne inside a cylindrical disk with a 370 pc radius for a period of 400 myr eventually yields one r - process production event .",
    "here we assess a local ccsn rate from two approaches .",
    "for the galaxy in whole , the current sfr and ccsn rate are estimated to be 1.65 yr@xmath57 @xcite and 2.3 sne per century @xcite , respectively ; these two establish the correlation that an sfr of 1 yr@xmath57 is equal to 1.4 sne per century .",
    "then , from the present - day local sfr of 0.48  1.1 gyr@xmath57pc@xmath56 @xcite , we obtain the ccsn rate of one per 2.1 - 4.8 myr within a 100 pc radius . on the other hand",
    ", the recent detection of @xmath58fe in deep - sea sediments reveals that two ccsne occurred 1.5 - 3.2 myr and 6.5 - 8.7 myr ago @xcite within a distance of 100 pc @xcite .",
    "then , putting the two results together , we finally adopt the ccsn rate of one per 4 myr within a 100 pc radius .",
    "the derived ccsn rate gives 1370 ccsne in total inside a cylindrical disk with a 370 pc radius for a period of 400 myr .",
    "this estimate is equivalent to the rate of r - process production by ns merger of one per 1370 ccsne .",
    "the rate is in fairly good agreement with the estimate of one per 1000@xmath22000 ccsne made from the correlation of stellar abundance between [ fe / h ] and [ eu / h ] in dsphs as well as from galactic chemical evolution @xcite .",
    "we reanalyze its frequency from abundance correlation between [ mg / h ] and [ eu / h ] among galactic stars to avoid uncertainties in the chemical enrichment process in dsphs and contribution from sne ia . by inputting mg",
    "yield from a ccsn deduced by the observed two quantities , i.e. , an average fe mass of 0.07 ( light curve analysis : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the plateau of [ mg / fe]=0.4 among halo stars , we obtain the frequency of one per @xmath11400 ccsne for eu production .",

    "<S> meteoritic abundances of r - process elements are analyzed to deduce the history of chemical enrichment by r - process from the beginning of disk formation to the present time in the solar vicinity , by combining the abundance information from short - lived radioactive nuclei such as @xmath0pu with that from stable r - process nuclei such as eu . </S>",
    "<S> these two types of nuclei can be associated with one r - process event and cumulation of events till formation of the solar system , respectively . with help of the observed local star formation history , </S>",
    "<S> we deduce the chemical evolution of @xmath0pu and obtain three main results : ( i ) the last r - process event occurred 130 - 140 myr before formation of the solar system , ( ii ) the present - day low @xmath0pu abundance as measured in deep sea reservoirs results from the low recent star formation rate compared to @xmath14.5@xmath25 gyr ago , and ( iii ) there were @xmath115 r - process events in the solar vicinity from formation of the galaxy to the time of solar system formation and @xmath130 r - process events to the present time . </S>",
    "<S> then , adopting a reasonable hypothesis that a neutron star merger is the r - process production site , we find that the ejected r - process elements are extensively spread out and mixed with interstellar matter with a mass of @xmath3 , which is about 100 times larger than that for supernova ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the event frequency of r - process production is estimated to be one per about 1400 core - collapse supernovae , which is identical to the frequency of neutron star mergers estimated from the analysis of stellar abundances . </S>"
