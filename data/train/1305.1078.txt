    "this will be important for the precise measurement of @xmath8 in polarized @xmath17 decays .",
    "when the quark mass is very heavy compared with the qcd scale @xmath61 , the light degrees of freedom in a heavy baryon @xmath2 ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) become blind to the flavor and spin quantum numbers of the heavy quark because of the @xmath7 symmetries .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum and flavor quantum numbers of the light degrees of freedom become good quantum numbers which can be used to classify heavy baryons , and @xmath2 corresponds to the state in which the angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom is zero .",
    "so it is natural to regard the heavy baryon as composed of one heavy quark and a light diquark . when @xmath3 corrections are taken into account ,",
    "since the isospin of @xmath2 is zero , the isospin of the light degrees of freedom is also zero .",
    "therefore , the spin of the light degrees of freedom should also be zero in order to guarantee that the total wave function of @xmath2 is anti - symmetric .",
    "hence the spin and isospin of the light degrees of freedom are still fixed even when @xmath3 corrections are taken in account .",
    "therefore , we still treat @xmath2 as composed of a heavy quark and a light diquark",
    ".    based on the above picture , the three - body system is simplified to a two - body system .",
    "we will establish the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation for @xmath2 in this picture to order @xmath64 .",
    "then , we will solve this equation numerically by assuming that the kernel contains the scalar confinement and the one - gluon - exchange terms .",

    "iv is reserved for summary and discussion .",
    "as we discussed in introduction , @xmath2 is regarded as a bound state of a heavy quark and a light scalar diquark .",
    "hence we can define the bs amplitude of @xmath2 as the following : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the field operators of the heavy quark at position @xmath68 and the light scalar diquark at position @xmath69 , respectively , @xmath70 is the momentum of @xmath2 , and @xmath71 is its velocity .",
    "let @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent the masses of the heavy quark and the light diquark in the baryon , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 represents the relative momentum of the two constituents . then , the bs amplitude in momentum space is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the coordinate of the center of mass and @xmath79 .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that the bs equation for @xmath2 has the following form in momentum space : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 are the momenta of the heavy quark and the light scalar diquark , respectively , @xmath83 is the kernel which is defined as the sum of two particle irreducible diagrams , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are propagators of the heavy quark with momentum @xmath86 and the light diquark with momentum @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xmath89    in order to solve the bs equation for @xmath2 to second order in the @xmath3 expansion , we rewrite eq .",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath91 remains unchanged in the @xmath3 expansion .",

    "only the parameter @xmath170 in the meson case has to be replaced by  @xmath175 which describes the scalar confinement interaction between the heavy quark and the diquark .",
    "however , the diquark is not a pointlike object , there should be a form factor in @xmath176 , @xmath177 , to describe the structure of the diquark ( see fig.1 )  @xcite , @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a parameter which freezes @xmath180 when @xmath181 is very small . in the high energy region",

    "<S> the value of the spin - dependant form factor for the matrix element @xmath4 , @xmath5 , which is non - zero at order @xmath6 , is obtained numerically from our model . </S>"
