    "the lear measurements at cern  @xcite , show large neutron halo factors for selected nuclei .",
    "the observations of this factor were performed by counting those nuclei which were born in annihilation reactions in antiprotonic atoms .",
    "the following processes were observed : @xmath3 @xmath4 here , @xmath5 denotes the nucleus with the atomic number @xmath6 , the mass number @xmath7 and the number of neutrons @xmath8 .",
    "the annihilation products consist of a  few ( usually 4 - 5 ) pions \\{@xmath9}.    in reactions shown the resulting nuclei have the number of neutrons or the number of protons diminished by one as compared to the mother nucleus . counting the annihilation products resulting from nuclear neutrons @xmath10 and from nuclear protons @xmath11",
    ", one can calculate the following halo factor @xmath12 . for the case of `` cold '' annihilation reactions which take place at the peripheral region of the nucleus and do not excite the final nuclei ,",
    "the factor @xmath2 is supposed to depend strongly on the ratio of neutron and proton densities .    in order to describe the phenomenon of annihilation of the antiprotonic atomic state on the mother nucleus",
    "we have done the calculation of the halo factor @xmath2 and the density ratios deviation @xmath13 , which we shall define later . as a  basis of our calculation serves the relativistic mean field model in which the field equations are solved numerically .",
    "these solutions are exact even far outside the nuclear surface .",
    "this precision is critical for the calculation of the quantities of interest .",
    "both quantities @xmath2 and @xmath13 , have been considered for nuclei : @xmath14ni , @xmath15zr , @xmath15ru , @xmath16te , @xmath17sm , @xmath18sm , @xmath19yb , @xmath20th , @xmath21u .",
    "all these nuclei were studied in ref .",
    "the halo factor @xmath2 shows also some dependence on the separation energies of the last nucleons ( proton or neutron ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define and discuss the model independent functions @xmath2 and @xmath13 which are supposed to characterize halo phenomena .",
    "an example , the droplet model calculation of @xmath13 is shown .",
    "the third section contains a  short presentation of the relativistic mean field model which we have used to determine @xmath2 and @xmath13 factors .    in the summary of the paper",
    "we show and comment on the results of our calculations",
    "in this section we define basic quantities which are suitable in discussing halo phenomena .",
    "the first subsection collects the approximations made in halo factor definitions .",
    "the second subsection introduces new quantities .",
    "these are average densities calculated from the density distribution and the deviation of average densities ratio from the homogeneous neutron and proton densities ratio .",
    "an example of this is shown and reviewed .",
    "the simple expression for the antiproton absorption width for the antiproton which occupies a  state @xmath22 of an atom is @xmath23 the subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 are for neutrons and protons respectively .",
    "the wave function @xmath26 of antiproton is determined in the schrdinger model of hydrogen  like antiprotonic atom within a  point nucleus .",
    "the approximation of the point like nucleus is motivated by the fact of a  large mean distance @xmath27 of the antiproton from the nucleus .",
    "taking the mass ratio of the antiproton to the electron @xmath28 , the main ( supposed ) quantum number @xmath24 of antiproton in the atom _ eg .",
    "_ , @xmath29 , and the charge of the nucleus in question , is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , is the bohr radius of the electron in the hydrogen atom . for the cases which we are considering here",
    "this gives an average antiproton - nucleus distance of the value @xmath32fm .",
    "as it is seen , this distance exceeds a few times past the nuclear radius @xmath33fm .",
    "this motivates our point nucleus approximation .",
    "it is possible to solve the dirac or the schrdinger equation for the more complicated case of finite or even deformed nucleus .",
    "however , this will not change significantly the relative measures which we shall introduce and apply in this present paper .",
    "the factor @xmath34 , in the definition of @xmath2 describes pion escape probability plus other effects and it will be discussed later . here",
    ", we may say only , that in the present model it does not influence the calculation and with very high accuracy it may be assumed as @xmath35 .",
    "we define the halo factor as  @xcite @xmath36 a similar definition was used in  @xcite .",
    "the summation run through all the antiprotonic atomic states for which one expects the large annihilation widths .",
    "usually it is assumed that only one state with @xmath37 ranging from @xmath38 for ni nucleus to @xmath39 to u nucleus contributes to these widths  @xcite . in the present calculation",
    "we sum a  few ( three to five ) states only .",
    "the summation stops if the addition of the successive @xmath40 term does not change the value of the sum .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention the weak dependence of our @xmath2 definition on the structure of the antiproton - nucleon ( @xmath41 ) interaction .",
    "it is assumed that both proton and neutron @xmath40 widths depend on the imaginary part of the complex optical potential w(r ) which is responsible for the absorption of the antiproton .",
    "we use the approximation that the optical potential is proportional to the density of nucleons : @xmath42 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is the @xmath41 interaction length and is taken as @xmath44 , where both real @xmath45 and imaginary @xmath46 parts of @xmath43 are constants  @xcite . in this way we obtain @xmath47 because both @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the definition of halo factor @xmath2 ( eq .  [ halof ] ) appear in a  ratio and thus depend weakly on the specific antiprotonic atomic state one concludes that the optical potential dependence of @xmath2 is washed out . in this sense @xmath2 is the @xmath41 interaction independent measure of the annihilation ratio and describes rather the geometrical properties of the nucleon density distributions .",
    "in fact , the definition of @xmath2 consists of @xmath50 which measures the cross sections annihilation ratio @xmath51 for the antiproton annihilation on nucleons in a  nuclear medium .",
    "the value of this ratio for a  given nucleus is very hard to estimate in an experiment or on theoretical grounds . in an early paper on nucleon  antinucleon optical potential by bryan and philips  @xcite ,",
    "the relative antiproton @xmath52-capture rates on neutrons and protons in singlet and triplet states was estimated from measurements of @xmath53 annihilation at rest in hydrogen and deuterium . from these",
    "one can calculate the ratio of capture on neutrons to the capture on protons .",
    "in singlet states it is close to 0.6 whereas in triplet states it exceeds 1 . the measurements by bugg et al .",
    "@xcite show that this ratio is close to 0.65 in case of the nucleus @xmath54c .",
    "other authors @xcite give us an imaginary potential ratio the value @xmath55% .",
    "in the paper by kalogeropoulos and tzanakos  @xcite , one can find a  similar value @xmath56 as measured in deuterium .",
    "these different numbers suggest that the annihilation ratio may change from one nucleus to the other and in our opinion , it is not possible to scale the results using these numbers  the ratio may show a  dependence on proton and neutron numbers @xmath6 and @xmath8 as well as the state in which the annihilation takes place .",
    "therefore , in the calculations which follow we do not scale our results . as we shall see the results show some similarity to the experimental data .",
    "this supports our choice of the rmf model calculation and shows that the ratio @xmath57 is close to unity for our model .    to select the peripheral annihilation acts ( which one observes in @xmath58 experiment )",
    "one should correct the definition of the halo factor on the pion escaping probability @xmath59 and the deep hole creation probability @xmath60 .",
    "one has to take into account only this part of the annihilation width @xmath61 which is responsible for the cold annihilation  the annihilation in which pions escape to infinity without exciting the rest of the system . on pure geometrical grounds this",
    "is shown to be a  power function of @xmath62 which agrees roughly with very accurate calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming the dependence @xmath63 , where @xmath64",
    ", one can see from the eq .",
    "[ halof ] that the summation of widths @xmath61 will run over nearly the same spectrum of powers of @xmath62 as without this factor .",
    "it is therefore allowed to stay with the old formulas in which @xmath34 is constant .",
    "another factor which probably enters the expression for @xmath61 is a deep hole creation factor @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "its role is again the preservation of cold acts of annihilation .",
    "the physics behind this is the following .",
    "a  number of annihilation acts may occur on a deeply situated nucleon levels .",
    "this leads to a  rearrangment of the nucleonic orbits and it may happen that the final system will show very small or positive ( ! ) binding energies of the last nucleons .",
    "after its emission , the nucleus in question goes out of the observation range and can not be counted as the peripheral halo product .",
    "the dependence of the function @xmath65 on @xmath62 seems to satisfy the power law analogous to pion escaping probability @xmath63 , and as it was said before , we do not introduce this into our calculation .",
    "these are all the approximations which we have assumed in our paper while evaluating the halo factor .",
    "consider an average density @xmath66 defined by the integral @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the sphericaly symmetric nucleon density distribution and @xmath69 in the integration volume element .",
    "n is the number of particles in the system and is given by @xmath70 in the case of pure fermi distribution @xmath71 the quantity @xmath66 can be evaluated approximately with assumed accuracy . in the above formula ,",
    "@xmath43 is the width of the nuclear surface , @xmath72 is the radius and @xmath73 is the central density of the nucleus .",
    "the expression valid to second order in expansion parameter @xmath74 can be obtained from the elton s formula ( pages 106 - 107 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to use this formula",
    "one has to modify the expression for the average density to the following form @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 the elton s integral is defined by @xmath78 from the formula mentioned before , one has to second order in @xmath74 @xmath79 a  relatively large , linear term @xmath80 , which appears in this expression makes the @xmath66 a  sensitive indicator of the peripheral properties of the nuclear densities .",
    "on the basis of both average densities @xmath81 and @xmath82 one can define the deviation of their ratio from the homogeneous densities ratio .",
    "this is @xmath83 inserting ( [ dfermi ] ) into the last equation shows @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the diffusness parameters of the neutron and proton distributions respectively and we have assumed @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ figliq ] shows an example of the deviation @xmath13 as calculated for all of the viewed nuclei in the case of the liquid droplet model densities  @xcite .",
    "the deviation @xmath13 was calculated from the parameters of this model and , the geometric dependencies of the @xmath43 and @xmath72 parameters entering the fermi density distribution ( see eq .",
    "[ fermi ] ) and the corresponding parameters of the liquid drop distribution  @xcite .",
    "figure [ figliq ] shows two kinds of data .",
    "the impulses show exact ( full lines ) and approximate ( dashed lines ) results respectively .",
    "one can see the good agreement of both exact , and approximate , calculated from eq .",
    "( [ devh ] ) of the density deviation @xmath13 values .",
    "large positive values of @xmath13 can be seen in the case of neutron rich nuclei like te , yb , th and u. the deviation @xmath13 is small and positive in cases of neutron deficient nuclei : ni , zr , ru . latter we shall see a  similar behaviour of @xmath13 for more realistic calculations done with the rmf model ( see figure [ figdev ] ) .",
    "in this section we describe very shortly the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model which we have used in the calculations of the neutron and proton densities entering both halo factor @xmath2 and the average density deviation .    the rmf theory starts from a  lagrangian consisting of nucleonic and mesonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in some sense it seems to be more fundamental than other mean field models like skyrme - hartree - fock and gogny - hartree - fock models .",
    "it gives the relativistic treatment of nucleonic and mesonic variables and a  proper description of the spin - orbit interactions .",
    "nevertheless it is still an effective phenomenological method based on the local densities and fields .",
    "the rmf theory was successfully used to reproduce parameters of the nuclear matter and some properties of finite nuclei like binding energies , mean square charge radii and quadrupole moments  @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the following field lagrangian density @xcite @xmath88 the fields belong to nucleons ( dirac spinor field @xmath89 ) , the low mass isovector - vector meson @xmath90 , isoscalar - vector @xmath91 , scalar @xmath92 and to the massless photon vector field @xmath93 .",
    "the field tensors are given by @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96    the dirac spinors @xmath97 of the nucleon and the fields of @xmath98 and @xmath99 mesons are solutions of the coupled dirac and klein  gordon equations which are obtained from eq .",
    "[ lrmf ] by means of the classical variational principle and they are then solved by iteration for the case of the spherically ",
    "symmetric systems of nucleons .",
    "this iteration goes through the following steps : we start from an estimate of meson and electromagnetic fields and we solve the dirac equation getting the spinors @xmath97 .",
    "the spinors are then used to obtain the densities .",
    "the latter serve as source to solve the klein gordon equations and achieve the new estimations of the meson and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the parameters used in our calculation are the same as in refs .  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the relativistic mean field model which was presented in the previous section and is described in detail in @xcite we have calculated the nucleon densities entering the eq .",
    "[ gamma ] for the absorption width and the halo factor eq .",
    "[ halof ] .",
    "we show that some of the nuclei are good candidates for the neutron halo systems and have promising large logarithm of neutron to proton density ratio @xmath100 .",
    "this ratio which we define as @xmath101 is a  sensitive quantity and it suits to relate densities especially in a peripheral nuclear region where both neutron and proton densities are very small .",
    "figure [ figlog ] shows this ratio for all nuclei under consideration .    in figure [ figlog ]",
    "one can see nuclei for which the logarithm @xmath100 , for @xmath102 , has the value of few orders .",
    "this means that the neutron density is there still greater then the proton density .",
    "this indicates a  possible large halo factor @xmath2 .",
    "one has to remember that the microscopic density @xmath103 is the sum of the single particles densities @xmath104 over all occupied states @xmath105 it is interesting to study the dependence on @xmath62 of the contribution of the single particle orbitals @xmath106 to the total density ? or in another words what is the collectivity of the nuclear density tail",
    "? the results of the rmf calculation for some nuclei in which the halo factor is discussed are presented in figure  [ figtails ] .",
    "it is seen that for large distances of 1014fm only a  few valence orbitals contribute to the density tail .",
    "even more , for some nuclei in which @xmath2 is large , one neutron orbital exhausts 90%  of the nuclear density . only in the case of @xmath17sm in addition to the neutron orbital @xmath107 there appears @xmath108 proton orbital with the comparable amplitude . in this nucleus one",
    "really observes very small neutron halo factor @xmath2 ( proton halo ) .",
    "we have to add from our numerical experience that the asymptotic behaviour of the single particle density depends dramatically on the single particle energy . for the orbitals less bounded the large @xmath62 tail of density",
    "is longer .",
    "so the halo effect will not be the only probe of the surface width of the neutron and proton distributions but also a  crucial test of the single particle structure foreseen by theoretical models .",
    "this also means the inclusion of a  nuclear shape deformation into our model could be important .",
    "figure [ figlogro ] shows the dependence of the logarithm of the total density of baryons against the distance @xmath62 measured from the center of the nucleus .",
    "the logarithm of the density in the peripheral area of the nucleus ( @xmath109 ) takes very small values and is nearly linear function of @xmath62 with a  steep negative slope .",
    "all the slopes for different nuclei are similar .",
    "we now consider another two quantities which characterize the real density distribution .",
    "the first is the deviation of density ratio @xmath13 from the homogeneous density ratio ( [ devh ] ) . in contrary to the case shown already in figure [ figliq ] , this is calculated for real density distributions determined from the rmf model . in analogy to eq .",
    "[ devh ] , it is defined through the average densities calculated in rmf model .",
    "the second quantity we considered is the celebrated halo factor @xmath2 ( eq . [ halof ] ) .",
    "both quantities give the measure of the density distribution in the nucleus .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ figdev ] and figure  [ figfac ] respectively .",
    "one can easily identify a  halo nuclei . in figure [ figdev ]",
    "you can see an interesting case of ru nucleus for which the relative density deviation @xmath13 is negative .",
    "this suggests the lack of the neutron halo for this nucleus . at the same time",
    "the halo factor @xmath110 .",
    "we concluded that the deviation @xmath13 is rather a  rough indication of the neutron halo in nuclei .",
    "the calculated halo factors @xmath2 are shown in figure  [ figfac ] and in table  1 where in addition we have also displayed the experimental values @xmath111 .",
    "these values were extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite . except for extreme cases of @xmath15ru , @xmath17sm and",
    "@xmath19yb one can observe a  good agreement between calculated factor @xmath112 and the experimental data .",
    "the case of @xmath19yb it is a  special one .",
    "it shows a  too low theoretical halo factor @xmath113 and a  very high measured value of @xmath114 .",
    "this is the case discussed also in @xcite .",
    "the case of samarium nucleus , @xmath17sm , shows @xmath2 which probably indicates the * proton halo * instead of neutron one . in our calculations we obtained in this case @xmath115 .",
    "the similar situation of large theoretical @xmath2 is observed in the nucleus @xmath15ru .",
    "in the relativistic mean field model we have calculated the halo factor @xmath2 and the factor @xmath13  the average density ratio deviation from the ratio of homogeneous density distributions , for nuclei in which we observed the neutron halo .    both quantities @xmath2 and @xmath13 indicate the possible halo effects in most of the studied nuclei but in some cases ( see eg . , yb nucleus ) they differ from experimental data significantly .",
    "this fact shows that one has to extend the rmf nuclear density model .",
    "the extension may include _ eg .",
    "_ , the deformation of the nuclear systems or / and the pairing interaction . the finite deformation in all considered cases may change the picture a  little bit of the neutron halo .",
    "the new parameter characterizing the peripheral properties of the nuclear density distributions , which we have called the average density ratio deviation @xmath13 , is proportional to the difference of the proton and the neutron surface diffuseness parameters . like @xmath2 , it points out these nuclei which show the neutron halo properties .",
    "some of our predictions , as compared to the experimental data , fail but most of them show correlations which are very promising ones .",
    "it is hard to explain the source of existing divergences .",
    "a  possible explanation may be the lack of deformation in our model calculations .",
    "it is also possible that the inclusion of pairing interaction to this theory may improve the results .",
