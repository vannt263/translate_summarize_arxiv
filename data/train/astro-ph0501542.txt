    "it has been pointed out already a decade ago ( matt & fabian 1994 ) that prominent spectral features , and especially the @xmath2 kev iron k@xmath3 emission line commonly found in seyferts spectra ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , may lead agn synthesis models to predict a detectable signature in the spectrum of the cosmic x  ray background ( xrb ) around a few kev . + the integrated contribution of iron line emission in the sources making the xrb has been quantitatively estimated by gilli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , on the basis of a large database of observational results available in the pre-_chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ era .",
    "the predicted shape of the integrated emission from individual lines was computed following the prescriptions of the xrb synthesis model of comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) resulting in a rather broad bump extending from about 1 kev ( depending on the maximum redshift assumed ) up to 6.4 kev .",
    "the expected intensity of such a bump above the xrb level is below the 5% level over most of the energy range and reaches a maximum value of the order of 7% around 23 kev , the exact value being dependent on the redshift ( @xmath4 ) at which the evolution of the luminosity function is stopped .",
    "although such an estimate is model dependent , gilli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that it can be safely regarded as an upper limit to the total iron line contribution .    in the last few years",
    "our knowledge of the xrb sources has been significantly improved by deep _",
    "chandra _ and xmm_newton _ surveys .",
    "a fraction as large as 8090% of the xrb flux below 56 kev has been resolved into individual sources ( worsley et al .",
    "extensive multiwavelength follow ",
    "up observations have clearly established that the x  ray source redshift distribution is peaked at @xmath50.71 ( e.g. hasinger 2004 , gilli 2004 ) and that about 60% of the xrb originates at @xmath6 1 ( barger et al . 2003 ) . in the xrb synthesis model worked out by gandhi & fabian ( 2003 ) the iron line contribution turned out to be maximum at about 3.8 kev ( corresponding to a typical redshift of 0.7 ) and the excess due to the iron line is of the order of 34 % .    despite the increasing number of independent observations of the xrb spectrum below 10 kev with bepposax ( vecchi et al .",
    "1999 ) , xmm_newton _ ( de luca & molendi 2004 ) and rxte ( revnivtsev et al . 2004 ) , yielding good signal to noise ratio measurements of the extragalactic background , the accuracy reached so far is not such to detect the iron features at the level expected by the model predictions outlined above .",
    "an alternative approach , devised to avoid the line smearing due to the large redshift range over which agn spectra are summed and the present uncertainties in the xrb spectrum , is to search for iron features over appropriate redshift bins .",
    "the detection of an iron line and the study of its intensity and profile would open the possibility to investigate interesting issues such as the metal abundances and the relative fraction of compton thick sources ( which are known to have extremely strong iron lines ) at high redshift , along with relativistically broadened lines beyond the local universe ( comastri , brusa , civano 2004 ; streblyanska et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the following we will present and discuss the results obtained for a large sample of spectroscopically identified sources in the x  ray surveys which resolved most of the xrb : the 2 ms pointing in the _ chandra _ deep field north ( alexander et al . 2003 ; hereinafter cdfn ) and the 1 ms observation of the _ chandra _ deep field south ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ; hereinafter cdfs ) . throughout the paper , the adopted values for the hubble constant and the cosmological parameters are h@xmath7=70 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9=0.7 , @xmath10=0.3",
    "the optical spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of the x  ray sources detected in the cdfn are presented by barger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , while a list of spectroscopic redshifts of the sources detected in the cdfs is reported in szokoly et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereinafter s04 ) .",
    "photometric redshifts based on good quality hst / acs images and deep isaac / vlt observations are available for all but four cdfs sources without spectroscopic redshift ( zheng et al .",
    "2004 ; hereinafter z04 ) , leading to a virtually complete catalog of identified x  ray sources .",
    "here we have considered only those cdfs photo  z with a quality flag greater than 0.5 ( see z04 for details ) ensuring a reliable redshift estimate . moreover , given that both s04 and z04 identifications are based on the x  ray source catalogue of giacconi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we have revised some optical / x  ray associations according to the improved astrometry provided by alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . only sources with spectroscopic redshifts have been included in the cdfn sample because no details are given on the photo  z quality in barger et al .",
    "the larger cdfs redshift completeness allows us to obtain a counting statistic per redshift bin similar to that of the cdfn despite the shorter exposure .",
    "individual source spectra have been stacked together in seven redshift bins spanning the @xmath11=0.54 range ( table 1 ) .",
    "the choice of bin sizes and distribution is driven by a trade  off between the number of counts in each bin and the need to sample a corresponding observed energy range narrow enough to detect the spectral feature , keeping at the same time the instrumental response as uniform as possible .",
    "for these reasons , the redshift interval below @xmath11=0.5 is not considered ; moreover , the redshift interval 1.7 @xmath12 2.5 is excluded because the iron line is redshifted in the @xmath13 1.82.4 kev energy range , which encompasses the sharp drop in the effective area due to the instrumental iridium edge .",
    "+ the iron line signal is not expected to be significantly diluted by non - agn sources .",
    "below z=2 , the k@xmath3 line falls in the hard band ( @xmath14 kev ) , where the detected sources are mostly agn . at higher redshifts",
    "it is shifted to the soft band , but then only sources with agn luminosities can be detected . in order to avoid contamination by a few individual bright sources which could dominate the stacked signal we have excluded from each bin the brightest object , if its contribution exceeds 50% of the entire flux in the bin .",
    "the chosen redshift bins , the expected position of the 6.4 kev line , the bin width and the number of sources in each bin are listed in table  1 .",
    "the final sample includes 171 sources in the cdfn and 181 in the cdfs , spanning the luminosity range l@xmath15 erg s@xmath8 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the small solid angle ( @xmath13 0.2 deg@xmath16 ) covered by the deep fields does not allow us to sample the agn population at higher luminosities .      the x  ray data for both the cdfn and cdfs observations have been retrieved from the public archive and processed with standard tools making use of the calibrations associated with the ciao software ( version 3.0 ) . + a total of 20 and 11 pointings in the cdfn and cdfs , respectively , were summed together with the merge_all script in two different merged event files . the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and gain corrections were also applied to each single pointing .",
    "spectra , response matrices and effective areas of the stacked spectrum in each redshift bin were extracted from the merged event files using the standard ciao tools developed to properly weight responses and effective area files for multiple extraction regions ( e.g. mkwarf ; see civano , comastri & brusa 2005 for a detailed description of the procedure ) .",
    "the target positions in each redshift bin span almost all the offaxis angles , thus the extraction radius was varied from 4 to 16 arcsec depending on the source brightness and off  axis position .",
    "several background spectra were extracted with the same procedure from a stack of regions nearby each source in each redshift bin and varied in size and shape .",
    "+ finally , the stacked spectra in each redshift bin of both the cdfn and cdfs were summed together with standard ftools routines ( mathpha , addarf , addrmf ) weighted for both the exposure time and the number of counts . in the following we will consider only the resulting cdfn+cdfs spectra .",
    "since we are interested in emission features over a well defined energy range , source spectra have been extracted in the 16 kev band , to minimize calibration uncertainties in the low energy response .",
    "x  ray spectra were rebinned to have at least 20 counts per bin and fitted with xspec ( version 11.3.0 ; arnaud 1996 ) ; errors are reported at the 90@xmath17 confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath18=2.71 ) .",
    "+ the continuum is parameterized with a single power ",
    "law with the slope free to vary .",
    "a negative ( @xmath19 = 0.17 ) edge at 2.07 kev has been added to account for residual uncertainties in the effective area above 2 kev , as suggested by the cxc team ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2005 ) . with the exception of the highest redshift bin ,",
    "a significant excess above a power  law continuum is present over the energy range 6.4/(1+@xmath20 ) ",
    "6.4/(1+@xmath21 ) kev , where @xmath21 and @xmath20 are the bin boundaries ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we then added a redshifted gaussian component ( model po+zgauss ) with the width free to vary , centroid energy fixed at 6.4 kev and redshift fixed at the mean value of each bin ( @xmath22 ) , and verified that in all cases the fit improved , though with a different level of significance .",
    "table  1 lists the best fit parameters for each redshift bin .",
    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) quoted in table  1 are measured in the observed frame . to get the intrinsic , rest frame",
    "ews a multiplicative factor @xmath23 must be applied ) is negligible . ] .      in order to check whether the results are dependent from the counting statistics and/or the energy range over which the continuum underlying the iron excess is measured , we have performed several safety checks .",
    "first , we have further excluded in each bin the two or three brightest sources , if their contribution to the total counts was larger than 60% .",
    "then , spectral fits were repeated in the 2.26 kev energy range for sources at @xmath24 .",
    "finally , a redshifted absorption component ( assumed to be at @xmath22 in each redshift bin ) was added to the continuum . in all cases ,",
    "the spectral parameters were found in agreement , within the statistical errors , with those reported in table  1 .",
    "furthermore , for the z@xmath25 bins for which the statistics is higher , we verified that , when the redshift of the line component is left free to vary , the resulting best fit redshift is always almost coincident with that expected from a line at 6.4 kev .",
    "extensive simulations have also been performed to quantitatively assess the line broadening introduced by redshift smearing .",
    "the spectra of the sources contributing to each bin were modeled as a single power law plus a narrow unresolved ( @xmath26=0.1 kev ) k@xmath3 line .",
    "the actually observed sources redshift distribution within the bin is further assumed and the individual simulated spectra are stacked together . with the exception of the @xmath11=0.91.1 bin , all the measured widths are in agreement with those resulting from the simulations , and therefore consistent with being produced by the superposition of narrow features ( but see also the discussion ) . according to xrb synthesis models , a large fraction of the sources contributing to each redshift bin are obscured by column densities in the range @xmath1310@xmath27 cm@xmath16 . when obscured sources at different redshifts are stacked together , the iron line underlying continuum is expected to be modified , with respect to a single power law , by the most prominent absorption features such as the low energy cut  off and the 7.1 kev iron edge . to take this into account",
    ", we assumed a continuum shape as resulting from the gilli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) model once the agn luminosity function is integrated in the narrow redshift bins adopted here .",
    "although the recomputed ew are lower than those reported in table 1 ( by about 30 - 50% ) , the line excess is still significant .",
    "a more detailed investigation would require an extensive analysis of the agn synthesis models parameter space and is beyond the purposes of this letter .",
    "the rest frame equivalent widths for the seven redshift bins are compared ( fig .",
    "2 ) with those predicted by the xrb synthesis model of gilli et al . ( 2001 , shaded area in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the line ew distribution is modeled following gilli et al .",
    "( 1999 , see their table  4 ) and is a function of the absorption column density increasing from about 250 ev for unobscured sources , to 400 ev for obscured ( log@xmath29 24 ) agn , reaching about 2 kev for compton thick sources .",
    "these values are constant over the entire redshift range .",
    "the upper bound of the shaded region has been computed assuming ew=280 ev for unobscured sources , consistent with the average value measured by asca in the nearby universe .",
    "recent xmm_newton _ and _ chandra _ results have questioned the presence of broad iron lines in many unobscured - type 1 agn , measuring in turn a lower ew ( @xmath30 ev on average ) along with a decrease of the line ew towards high luminosities ( e.g. page et al .",
    "we have quantitatively estimated the effects of reducing the line ew among unobscured sources by considering the most conservative case of no iron emission at all ( lower bound in fig .  2 ) .",
    "since in our model most of the iron signal is produced by obscured sources with @xmath31 log(n@xmath32)@xmath33 cm@xmath16 , the overall ew are reduced by only @xmath34 .",
    "[ eqwz ]    the lack of any dependence of the average line intensity upon redshift up to @xmath35 could be naively interpreted as a constant iron abundance with redshift .",
    "the real case is likely to be much more complicated , given the several factors affecting the detected signal . as an example , the population of heavily obscured compton thick sources ( which have the strongest iron lines ) might be hiding among the x  ray sources either unidentified or with a poorly constrained photo  z and thus not included in the present analysis .",
    "however , according to our calculations ( gilli et al . 2001 ) , compton thick agn are expected to provide only about 510% of the iron signal in each redshift bin .",
    "the presence of a population of compton thick sources much larger than that assumed would be more easily appreciated by the distortions introduced on the broad band 3100 kev xrb spectrum rather than by a stronger line in the various redshift bins .",
    "a significant decrease of the line ew towards high luminosities has been reported by nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a sample of type 1 agn observed with asca .",
    "the effect is more pronunced for luminosities higher than @xmath36 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , our sample is not well suited to investigate iron line properties at high luminosities due to the lack of sources luminous enough ( see table  1 ) to check the nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) findings .",
    "moreover , the stacked spectra are dominated by obscured sources rather than type 1 agn adding further uncertainties in the comparison",
    ".    our findings are also consistent with those reported by streblyanska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from the analysis of the rest ",
    "frame stacked spectrum of identified sources in the xmm_newton _ observation of the lockman hole ( @xmath37 ev , when a gaussian profile is considered ) .",
    "the residuals leftward of the iron line which in our fits are more prominent in the bins with the highest number of sources and counting statistic ( @xmath11=0.50.7 and 0.91.1 ) suggest the presence of a broad redshifted component , similar to that observed by streblyanska et al .",
    "since the main goal of the present analysis is the detection of iron emission in the sources of the xrb up to high redshifts , our approach is not designed to investigate in detail the average line shape .",
    "we recall , however , that the observed ew and line profile are dependent on an accurate modeling of the underlying continuum .",
    "the superposition of absorbed spectra with different redshifts has the effect of reducing the measured ew ( see previous section ) and furthermore may produce a spurious red wing .",
    "we report the detection of iron emission up to @xmath38 in the x  ray spectra of faint _",
    "sources stacked into different redshift bins .",
    "the measured ew are in agreement with a scenario in which the lines are intrinsically narrow and their intensity does not change significantly with redshift ( and/or luminosity ) , which can be interpreted as a constant iron abundance as a function of redshift .",
    "extensive simulations and safety checks have been performed in order to test the reliability of our results . even taking into account the effects of absorption features which modify the high energy power law in obscured sources",
    "the detection of the emission line remains significant . despite their prominent iron lines ,",
    "our approach does not allow to put tight constraints on the number density of compton thick sources , that suffer from extreme absorption in the _ chandra _ band and can be detected only in small numbers compared to compton thin agn .",
    "although there might be hints for the presence of gravitationally redshifted broad line components , we caution that their intensity and profile significantly depends on the modeling of the underlying continuum .",
