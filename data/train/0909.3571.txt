    "recently , a power - counting renormalizable , ultra - violet ( uv ) complete theory of gravity was proposed by hoava in @xcite .",
    "although presenting an infrared ( ir ) fixed point , namely general relativity , in the uv the theory possesses a fixed point with an anisotropic , lifshitz scaling between time and space of the form @xmath0 , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the scaling factor , dynamical critical exponent , spatial coordinates and temporal coordinate , respectively .    due to these novel features , there has been a large amount of effort in examining and extending the properties of the theory itself @xcite .",
    "additionally , application of hoava - lifshitz gravity as a cosmological framework gives rise to hoava - lifshitz cosmology , which proves to lead to interesting behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can examine specific solution subclasses @xcite , the perturbation spectrum @xcite , the gravitational wave production @xcite , the matter bounce @xcite , the black hole properties @xcite , the dark energy phenomenology @xcite , the astrophysical phenomenology @xcite etc .",
    "however , despite this extended research , there are still many ambiguities if hoava - lifshitz gravity is reliable and capable of a successful description of the gravitational background of our world , as well as of the cosmological behavior of the universe @xcite .",
    "although the discussion about the foundations and the possible conceptual and phenomenological problems of hoava - lifshitz gravity and cosmology is still open in the literature , it is worth investigating in a systematic way the possible cosmological behavior of a universe governed by hoava gravity .",
    "thus , in the present work we perform a phase - space and stability analysis of hoava - lifshitz cosmology , with or without the detailed - balance condition , and we are interesting in investigating the possible late - time solutions . in these solutions",
    "we calculate various observable quantities , such are the dark - energy density and equation - of - state parameters",
    ". as we see , indeed hoava - lifshitz cosmology can be consistent with observations and in addition it can give rise to a bouncing universe .",
    "furthermore , the results seem to be independent of the specific form of the dark matter content of the universe .",
    "this analysis however does not enlighten the discussion about possible conceptual problems and instabilities of hoava - lifshitz gravity , which is the subject of interest of other studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the basic ingredients of hoava - lifshitz cosmology , extracting the friedmann equations , and describing the dark matter and dark energy dynamics . in section [ phaseanalysis ]",
    "we perform a systematic phase - space and stability analysis for various cases under the detailed - balance condition , including a flat or non - flat geometry in the presence or not of a cosmological constant . in section [ nondetbal ]",
    "we extend the phase - space analysis in the case where the detailed - balance condition is relaxed . in section [ cosmimpl ]",
    "we discuss the corresponding cosmological implications and the effects on observable quantities .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we begin with a brief review of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "the dynamical variables are the lapse and shift functions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , and the spatial metric @xmath8 ( roman letters indicate spatial indices ) . in terms of these fields",
    "the full metric is @xmath9 where indices are raised and lowered using @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling transformation of the coordinates reads ( z=3 ) : @xmath10    decomposing the gravitational action into a kinetic and a potential part as @xmath11 , and under the assumption of detailed balance @xcite ( the extension beyond detail balance will be performed later on ) , which apart form reducing the possible terms in the lagrangian it allows for a quantum inheritance principle @xcite ( the @xmath12 dimensional theory acquires the renormalization properties of the d - dimensional one ) , the full action of hoava - lifshitz gravity is given by @xmath13 \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath15 the cotton tensor , and the covariant derivatives are defined with respect to the spatial metric @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath16 is the totally antisymmetric unit tensor , @xmath17 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath18 is a negative constant which is related to the cosmological constant in the ir limit . finally , the variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants with mass dimensions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .    in order to add the dark - matter content in a universe governed by hoava gravity , a scalar field",
    "is introduced @xcite , with action : @xmath25,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 acts as a potential term and @xmath27 are constants .",
    "although one could just follow a hydrodynamical approximation and introduce straightaway the density and pressure of a matter fluid @xcite , the field approach is more robust , especially if one desires to perform a phase - space analysis .    now , in order to focus on cosmological frameworks , we impose the so called projectability condition @xcite and use an frw metric , @xmath28 with @xmath29 where @xmath30 correspond to open , flat , and closed universe respectively .",
    "in addition , we assume that the scalar field is homogenous , i.e @xmath31 . by varying @xmath6 and @xmath8 , we obtain the equations of motion : @xmath32+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\kappa^2}{6(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\left [ -\\frac{3\\kappa^2\\mu^2k^2}{8(3\\lambda-1)a^4 } -\\frac{3\\kappa^2\\mu^2\\lambda ^2}{8(3\\lambda-1 ) }   \\right]+\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda k}{8(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33-\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\kappa^2}{4(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\left[-\\frac{\\kappa^2\\mu^2k^2}{8(3\\lambda-1)a^4 } + \\frac{3\\kappa^2\\mu^2\\lambda ^2}{8(3\\lambda-1 ) }   \\right]+\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda k}{16(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the hubble parameter as @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the equation of motion for the scalar field reads : @xmath35    at this stage we can define the energy density and pressure for the scalar field responsible for the matter content of the hoava - lifshitz universe : @xmath36 concerning the dark - energy sector we can define @xmath37 @xmath38 the term proportional to @xmath39 is the usual `` dark radiation term '' , present in hoava - lifshitz cosmology @xcite .",
    "finally , the constant term is just the explicit ( negative ) cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , in expressions ( [ rhode]),([pde ] ) we have defined the energy density and pressure for the effective dark energy , which incorporates the aforementioned contributions .",
    "using the above definitions , we can re - write the friedmann equations ( [ fr1]),([fr2 ] ) in the standard form : @xmath40 + \\frac{\\beta k}{a^2}\\\\ \\label{fr2b } \\dot{h}+\\frac{3}{2}h^2 & = & -\\frac{\\kappa^2}{4(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\big[p_m+p_{de }   \\big]+ \\frac{\\beta k}{2a^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these relations we have defined @xmath41 , which is the coefficient of the curvature term .",
    "additionally , we could also define an effective newton s constant and an effective light speed @xcite , but we prefer to keep @xmath42 in the expressions , just to make clear the origin of these terms in hoava - lifshitz cosmology . finally , note that using ( [ phidott ] ) it is straightforward to see that the aforementioned dark matter and dark energy quantities verify the standard evolution equations : @xmath43",
    "the aforementioned formulation of hoava - lifshitz cosmology has been performed under the imposition of the detailed - balance condition . however , in the literature there is a discussion whether this condition leads to reliable results or if it is able to reveal the full information of hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "thus , for completeness , we add here the friedmann equation in the case where detailed balance is relaxed .",
    "in such a case one can in general write @xcite : @xmath44+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{2}{(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\left [ \\frac{\\sigma_1}{6}+\\frac{\\sigma_3k^2}{6a^4 } + \\frac{\\sigma_4k}{a^6 }   \\right]+\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{\\sigma_2}{3(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\frac{k}{a^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath45-\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{3}{(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\left [ -\\frac{\\sigma_1}{6}+\\frac{\\sigma_3k^2}{18a^4 } + \\frac{\\sigma_4k}{6a^6 }   \\right]+\\nonumber\\\\&+ &   \\frac{\\sigma_2}{6(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\frac{k}{a^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , and the constants @xmath47 are arbitrary ( although one can set @xmath48 to be positive too ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the detailed - balance relaxation is the decoupling of the coefficients , together with the appearance of a term proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "this term has a negligible impact at large scale factors , however it could play a significant role at small ones . finally , in the non - detailed - balanced case , the energy density and pressure for matter coincide with those of detailed - balance scenario ( expressions ( [ rhom]),([pressurem ] ) ) , since the detailed - balance condition affects only the gravitational sector of the theory and has nothing to do with the matter content of the universe",
    ". however , the corresponding quantities for dark energy are generalized to @xmath50    having presented the cosmological equations of a universe governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity , under detailed - balance condition or not , we can investigate the possible cosmological behaviors and discuss the corresponding physical implications by performing a phase - space analysis .",
    "this is done in the following two sections , for the detailed and non - detailed balance cases separately .",
    "in order to perform the phase - space and stability analysis of the hoava - lifshitz universe , we have to transform the cosmological equations into an autonomous dynamical system @xcite .",
    "this will be achieved by introducing the auxiliary variables : @xmath51 together with @xmath52 .",
    "thus , it is easy to see that for every quantity @xmath53 we acquire @xmath54 . using these variables",
    "we can straightforwardly obtain the density parameters of dark matter and dark energy ( through expressions ( [ rhom ] ) , ( [ rhode ] ) ) as : @xmath55 and in addition we can calculate the corresponding equation - of - state parameters : @xmath56 we mention that these relations are always valid , that is independently of the specific state of the system ( they are valid in the whole phase - space and not only at the critical points ) .",
    "finally , for completeness , and observing ( [ fr1b ] ) , we can define the curvature density parameter as : @xmath57    using the auxiliary variables ( [ auxilliaryx]),([auxilliaryy]),([auxilliaryz]),([auxilliaryu ] ) the cosmological equations of motion ( [ fr1b ] ) , ( [ fr2b ] ) , ( [ phidot2 ] ) and ( [ sdot2 ] ) , can be transformed into an autonomous form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the column vector constituted by the auxiliary variables , * f(x ) * the corresponding column vector of the autonomous equations , and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "the critical points @xmath60 are extracted satisfying @xmath61 , and in order to determine the stability properties of these critical points we expand around @xmath60 , setting @xmath62 with @xmath63 the perturbations of the variables considered as a column vector .",
    "thus , up to the first order we acquire @xmath64 where the matrix @xmath65 contains the coefficients of the perturbation equations .",
    "thus , for each critical point , the eigenvalues of @xmath65 determine its type and stability .    in the following we perform a phase - space analysis of the cosmological system at hand .",
    "as we can see from the friedmann equations ( [ fr1 ] ) , ( [ fr2 ] ) one can have a zero or non - zero cosmological constant , in a flat or non - flat universe .",
    "thus , for simplicity we investigate separately the corresponding four cases .",
    "finally , note that we assume @xmath66 as required by the consistency of the hoava gravitational background , but we do not impose any other constraint on the model parameters ( although one could do so using the light speed and newton s constant values ) in order to remain as general as possible .      in this scenario the variable @xmath68 is irrelevant , and the friedmann equations ( [ fr1 ] ) , ( [ fr2 ] ) become : @xmath69 thus , after using the first of these relations in order to eliminate one variable , the corresponding autonomous system writes : @xmath70 we mention that for simplicity we have set @xmath71 and we have assumed it to be a constant , that is we are investigating the usual exponential potentials .",
    "however , as we will see this is not necessary , since the most important results of the present work are independent of the matter sector .",
    "the autonomous system ( [ eqzcase1 ] ) is defined in the phase space @xmath72 as we observe , this phase plane is not compact since @xmath3 is in general unbounded .",
    "however , the system is integrable and the orbit in the plane @xmath73 , passing initially through @xmath74 , can be obtained explicitly and it is given by the graph @xmath75}{6     q^2 - 9}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the critical points @xmath76 of the autonomous system ( [ eqzcase1 ] ) are obtained by setting the left hand sides of the equations to zero .",
    "they are displayed in table [ crit ] , where we also present the necessary conditions for their existence .",
    "in addition , for each critical point we calculate the values of @xmath77 ( given by relation ( [ wm ] ) ) , of @xmath78 ( given by ( [ omegade ] ) ) , and of @xmath79 ( given by ( [ wde ] ) ) .",
    "note that in this case , @xmath79 remains unspecified and the results hold independently of its value .",
    "finally , the @xmath80 matrix @xmath65 of the linearized perturbation equations writes : @xmath81,\\ ] ] and in table [ crit ] we display its eigensystems ( eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors ) evaluated at each critical points , as well as their type and stability , acquired by examining the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues .    ccccccccc cr .",

    "however , if at least one eigenvalue has a zero real part ( non - hyperbolic critical point ) one is not able to obtain conclusive information about the stability from linearization and needs to resort to other tools like normal forms calculations @xcite , or numerical experimentation .",
    "thus , in the case at hand , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are nonhyperbolic for @xmath102 while @xmath103 is nonhyperbolic for @xmath104 . finally , note that in the special case where @xmath105 , the system admits an extra curve of critical points @xmath106 each point in @xmath107 is non - hyperbolic , with center manifold tangent to the z - axis , but the curve @xmath107 is actually `` normally hyperbolic '' @xcite .",
    "this means that we can indeed analyze the stability by analyzing the sign of the real parts of the non - null eigenvalues .",

    "finally , we implement the cubic transformation    @xmath240\\\\ x_3 +    x_3     \\left[(x+x_2+x_3)^2-x_4 ^ 2\\right]\\\\ x_4 +    \\frac{1}{24 }     \\left[-12 x_4 ^ 3 + 9 ( x+x_2+x_3)^2 x_4 + 96     q^2 y^2 x_4 + 8 \\sqrt{6 } q     ( x_3 - 2 x ) y^2\\right]\\\\ x+    x     \\left[(x+x_2+x_3)^2-x_4 ^ 2\\right]\\\\ y+    \\frac{y \\left\\{945     x^2 + 42 \\left(45 x_2 + 45 x_3 - 16 \\sqrt{6 } q     x_4\\right ) x+5 \\left\\{189 x_2 ^ 2 + 14 \\left(27 x_3 - 8     \\sqrt{6 } q x_4\\right ) x_2 + 3 \\left\\{63     x_3 ^ 2 - 40 \\sqrt{6 } q x_4 x_3 + 28     \\left[\\left(2 q^2 - 3\\right ) x_4 ^ 2 - 12 \\text{q$\\phi     $ } ^2 y^2\\right]\\right\\}\\right\\}\\right\\}}{2520 } \\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ]    as a result , we get the simplified system in the new variables : @xmath241 @xmath242 where @xmath243 denotes terms of fourth order with respect to the vector norm . the center manifold , @xmath244 is tangent to the y - axis at the origin , and it can be represented locally , up to an error @xmath243 , as the graph @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a positive , sufficiently small constant . from ( [ normaly ] )",
    "we deduce that @xmath171 , under the initial condition @xmath247 , evolves as @xmath248 . hence ,",
    "as time passes the origin is approached and thus the critical point @xmath188 is definitely an attractor .",
    "note also that since it has a 1-dimensional center manifold tangent to the @xmath171-axis , then the stable manifold of @xmath188 is 4-dimensional , which also proves that @xmath188 is a late - time attractor .",
    "since we have performed a phase - space analysis of a universe governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity , with or without the detailed - balance condition , we can now discuss the corresponding cosmological behavior .        in this scenario",
    "the critical points @xmath85 are not relevant from a cosmological point of view , since apart from being unstable they correspond to complete dark matter domination , with the matter equation - of - state parameter being unphysically stiff",
    ". however , point @xmath103 is more interesting since it is stable for @xmath93 and thus it can be the late - time state of the universe . if additionally we desire to keep the dark - matter equation - of - state parameter in the physical range @xmath249 then we have to restrict the parameter @xmath87 in the range @xmath250 .",
    "however , even in this case the universe is finally completely dominated by dark matter . the fact that @xmath251 means that in general this sub - class of universes will be expand forever .",
    "the critical points @xmath107 consist a stable late - time solution , with a physical dark - matter equation - of - state parameter @xmath252 , but with zero dark energy density .",
    "we mention that the dark - matter domination of the case at hand was expected , since in the absent of curvature and of a cosmological constant the corresponding hoava - lifshitz universe is comprised only by dark matter .",
    "note however that the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter can be arbitrary .      in this scenario ,",
    "the first three critical points are identical with those of case 1 , and thus the physical implications are the same . the critical points @xmath108 are unstable , corresponding to a dark - matter dominated universe .",
    "this was expected since in the absence of the cosmological constant @xmath253 , the curvature role is downgrading as the scale factor increases and thus in the end this case tends to the case 1 above .",
    "note however that at early times , where the scale factor is small , the behavior of the system will be significantly different than case 1 , with the dark energy playing an important role .",
    "this different behavior is observed in the corresponding phase - space figures [ fig2a ] , [ fig2b ] comparing with figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the case at hand admits another solution sub - class , namely points @xmath114 . in these points @xmath124 , and thus using ( [ auxilliaryz ] ) we straightforwardly find the late - time solution @xmath254 , with @xmath255|$ ] .",
    "this solution corresponds to an oscillatory universe @xcite , and in the context of hoava - lifshitz cosmology it has already been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "as we see , these critical points are unstable and thus this solution subclass can not be a late - time attractor in the case of a non - flat universe with zero cosmological constant .",
    "this situation will change in the case where the cosmological constant is switched on .      under this scenario ,",
    "the hoava - lifshitz universe admits two unstable critical points ( @xmath135 ) , completely dominated by stiff dark matter .",
    "point @xmath137 exhibits a more physical dark matter equation - of - state parameter , but still with negligible dark energy at late times .",
    "the case at hand admits the two nonhyperbolic points @xmath139",
    "possessing @xmath142 , and thus ( as can be seen by ( [ auxilliaryu ] ) ) they correspond to the oscillatory solution @xmath256 , with @xmath257|$ ] .",
    "we mention that these points are nonhyperbolic , with a negative eigenvalue , and thus they have a large probability to be a late - time solution of hoava - lifshitz universe .",
    "additionally , they correspond to dark - energy domination , with dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath22 and an arbitrary @xmath84 .",
    "these features make them good candidates to be a realistic description of the universe .",
    "we mention that this result is independent from the parameter @xmath87 which comes from the dark matter sector .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is valid independently of the matter - content of the universe .",
    "indeed , this behavior is novel , and arises purely by the extra terms that are present in hoava gravity .",
    "this case admits the unstable critical points @xmath258 which correspond to a dark - matter dominated universe , and the unstable points @xmath150 which are unphysical since they possess @xmath259 .",
    "as expected , the system admits also the unstable points @xmath155 which correspond to oscillatory universes with @xmath254 ( @xmath255|$ ] ) .",
    "however , we find two more oscillatory critical points , namely @xmath154 , which correspond to @xmath256 , with @xmath257|$ ] .",
    "these points are nonhyperbolic , with a negative eigenvalue , and thus they have a large probability to be the late - time state of the universe , and additionally this result is independent of the specific form of the dark - matter content . furthermore , they correspond to a dark - energy dominated universe , with @xmath260 and arbitrary @xmath84 .",
    "thus , they are good candidates for a realistic description of the universe .",
    "let us now discuss about the cosmological behavior of a hoava - lifshitz universe , in the case where the detailed balance condition is abandoned . in this case",
    "the system admits the unstable critical points @xmath261 which correspond to dark matter domination , the unstable point @xmath202 corresponding to an unphysical dark - energy dominated universe , and the unstable @xmath262 which have physical @xmath84 , @xmath79 but dependent on the specific dark - matter form .",
    "the system admits also the critical points @xmath183 , @xmath207 which are nonhyperbolic with positive non - null eigenvalues , thus unstable , with furthermore unphysical cosmological quantities .",
    "additionally , points @xmath186 are also dark - matter dominated , unstable nonhyperbolic ones .",
    "it is interesting to notice that since @xmath263 has an arbitrary sign , @xmath204 could also correspond to an oscillatory universe , for a wide region of the parameters @xmath263 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , this oscillatory behavior has a small probability to be the late - time state of the universe because it is not stable ( with at least two positive eigenvalues ) .",
    "additionally , the fact that it depends on @xmath87 means that this solution depends on the matter form of the universe .",
    "the scenario at hand admits a final critical point , namely @xmath188 .",
    "as we showed in detail in section [ nondetbal ] using normal forms techniques , it is indeed stable and thus it can be a late - time attractor of hoava - lifshitz universe beyond detailed balance . using the definition of the auxiliary variables",
    ", we can straightforwardly show that it corresponds to an eternally expanding solution .",
    "additionally , it is characterized by complete dark energy domination , with dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath22 and arbitrary @xmath84 .",
    "note also that this result is independent of the specific form of the dark - matter content .",
    "these feature make it a very good candidate for the description of our universe .",
    "we mention that according to the initial conditions , this universe on its way towards this late - time attractor can be just an expanding universe with a non - negligible dark matter content , which is in agreement with observations , and this can be verified also by numerical investigation .",
    "this fact makes the aforementioned result more concrete .",
    "in this work we performed a detailed phase - space analysis of hoava - lifshitz cosmology , with and without the detailed - balance condition .",
    "in particular , we examined if a universe governed by hoava gravity can have late - time solutions compatible with observations .    in the case where the detailed - balance condition is imposed , we find that the universe can reach a bouncing - oscillatory state at late times , in which dark - energy , behaving as a simple cosmological constant , will be dominant .",
    "such solutions were already investigated in the context of hoava - lifshitz cosmology @xcite as possible ones , but now we see that they can indeed be the late - time attractor for the universe .",
    "they arise purely from the novel terms of hoava - lifshitz cosmology , and in particular the dark - radiation term proportional to @xmath39 is responsible for the bounce , while the cosmological constant term is responsible for the turnaround .    in the case where the detailed - balance condition is abandoned , we find that the universe reaches an eternally expanding solution at late times , in which dark - energy , behaving like a cosmological constant , dominates completely .",
    "note that according to the initial conditions , the universe on its way to this late - time attractor can be an expanding one with non - negligible matter content .",
    "we mention that this behavior is independent of the specific form of the dark - matter content .",
    "thus , the aforementioned features make this scenario a good candidate for the description of our universe , in consistency with observations .",
    "finally , in this case the universe has also a probability to reach an oscillatory solution at late times , if the initial conditions lie in its basin of attraction ( in this case the eternally expanding solution will not be reached ) .",
    "although this analysis indicates that hoava - lifshitz cosmology can be compatible with observations , it does not enlighten the discussion about possible conceptual and phenomenological problems and instabilities of hoava - lifshitz gravity , nor it can interfere with the questions concerning the validity of its theoretical background , which is the subject of interest of other studies .",
    "it just faces the problem from the cosmological point of view , and thus its results can been taken into account only if hoava gravity passes successfully the aforementioned theoretical tests .",
    "while this work was being typed , we became aware of @xcite , which presents also an analysis of the phase - space of hoava - lifshitz cosmology , though in a different framework .",
    "we agree with @xcite on the regions of overlap .",
