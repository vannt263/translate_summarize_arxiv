    "the coupled - channels ( cc ) method is the most powerful tool to study nuclear reactions . however , it becomes extremely complicated when it is necessary to include a large number of channels in the calculation . in situations where one is only interested in a detailed description of a single channel , e.g. in elastic scattering",
    ", one can resort to the polarization potential approach .",
    "it consists of deriving a potential , to be added to the hamiltonian of the elastic channel which leads to the same elastic wave function as that obtained by solution of the cc equations .",
    "the natural framework to derive this potential is feschbach formalism @xcite . although the exact derivation of the polarization potential may be as difficult as solving the cc problem , in some situations it is possible to find good approximations for it .",
    "approximate polarization potentials have been derived by several authors , for collisions at near - barrier energies @xcite  and energies well above the barrier @xcite .",
    "a serious drawback of these potentials is that they are non - local and _ l_- and _ e_-dependent .",
    "although any non - local potential can be replaced by a trivially equivalent local one , the latter present poles and has an artificial dependence on the quantum numbers of the elastic wave function .    for practical purposes , it is convenient to have local polarization potentials independent of @xmath2 , in order that it could be used in standard computer codes .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to achieve this goal . in a recent paper , lubian and nunes",
    "@xcite  tested the validity of the approach of thompson _",
    "et al_. @xcite , in the case of breakup coupling , which is very important in collisions of weakly bound projectiles @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend this study to other procedures to derive _",
    "l_-independent potentials in the case of @xmath3 scattering at near - barrier energies . for simplicity",
    ", we represent the continuum by an effective bound channel , restricting ourselves to two - channels .",
    "although this is not an appropriate description of the continuum , it is suitable for the qualitative purposes of the present work since this effective state also leads to a long range polarization potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we give a brief description of the polarization potential , according to feshbach s formalism . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss different prescriptions suggested to derive _ l_-independent local potentials without poles . in sect .",
    "4 we apply these prescriptions to @xmath4 scattering and compare the results with the corresponding ones obtained with the cc method . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we summarize the conclusions of this work .",
    "let us consider a collision described in terms of the collision degrees of freedom ( projectile - target separation vector ) , @xmath5 and a set of intrinsic degrees of freedom , represented by @xmath6 the scattering wave function @xmath7  satisfies a schrdinger equation with the total hamiltonian@xmath8 above , @xmath9 depends only on the collision degrees of freedom@xmath10 acts only on the intrinsic space and @xmath11  couples collision with intrinsic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is convenient to perform the channel expansion of the scattering state , in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath12 , which satisfy the equation@xmath13 in the form @xmath14 the intrinsic space can be divided in two complementary parts by the action of the projectors @xmath15 above , @xmath16  stands for the ground state of @xmath12 and we take @xmath17  these projectors have the properties @xmath18 acting with these projectors on the scattering state , one gets @xmath19 applying these projectors on the schrdinger equation , using eq.([psi ] ) and rearranging the terms , one obtains @xmath20   ~|\\psi_{p}\\rangle &   = p\\mathbb{v}q|\\psi_{q}\\rangle ~.\\label{proj1}\\\\ \\left [   e - q\\mathbb{h}q\\right ]   ~|\\psi_{q}\\rangle &   = q\\mathbb{v}p|\\psi _ { p}\\rangle~.\\label{proj2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath21 .",
    "( [ proj1 ] ) can be used to define the polarization potential operator viz,@xmath22 this is the basis of the calculation of refs . @xcite as they employ a numerical solution of the cc equations and make use of the above definition . to derive an explicit expression for the polarization potential operator ,",
    "one first derive an expression for the projected state @xmath23 by multiplying eq.([proj2 ] ) from the left with the green s function @xmath24 the result is @xmath25 inserting the above equation in eq.([proj1 ] ) , we get @xmath26   ~|\\psi_{p}\\rangle=0.\\label{sch - hef}%\\ ] ] above , @xmath27 is the effective hamiltonian @xmath28 taking the scalar product of eq.([sch - hef ] ) with @xmath29 , using the explicit form of @xmath30 ( eq.([pq ] ) ) and replacing @xmath31 , we obtain the schrdinger equation for the elastic wave function in the space of the collision degree of freedom @xmath32 above , @xmath33 is the kinetic energy operation , and the optical , @xmath34 , and the polarization potentials , @xmath35 , are @xmath36 the above form for the polarization potential is numerically identical to the one defined by eq.([nova - eq ] )    as a consequence of the analytical structure of the green operator ( the presence of @xmath37 in eq .",

    "since one usually resorts to several approximations to derive a local _ l_-independent polarization potential , the above relation may eventually be broken .",
    "however , it does supply an important check on numerical evaluation of the polarization potential , just like unitarity and the s - matrix .    for practical purposes ,",
    "it is convenient to write eq.([schopol ] ) in the coordinate representation . while the optical potential is generally taken to be local and energy - dependent ( owing to the effect of exchange non - locality , removed to obtain a non - dispersive local equivalent potential @xcite ) , the non - locality of @xmath43 leads to a non - local polarization potential .",
    "one obtains the equation , @xmath44   ~\\psi_{0}(\\mathbf{r})+\\int u^{pol}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})~\\psi_{0}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}% ) ~d^{3}\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}=e~\\psi_{0}(\\mathbf{r}),\\ ] ] with @xmath45 ~\\left\\vert \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right\\rangle .\\label{upol - rr}%\\ ] ]    for some applications one replaces @xmath46 by the trivially equivalent local potential , @xmath47 this potential has some undesirable features .",
    "firstly , it has poles where @xmath48 vanishes .",
    "secondly , the above procedure introduces artificial dependences on the quantum numbers of @xmath49  these points will be discussed in further details in the next section .",
    "we should mention that our general expression for @xmath50 ( eq . ( [ upol - rr ] ) ) can account for the most general coupled channels situation .",
    "in particular , in the cdcc discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the breakup continuum is discretized into an orthonormalized set of bins , which would then span the _ q_-space .",
    "the polarization potential for this case , after writing for q,@xmath51 where @xmath52 designates the @xmath53 bin , and assuming that the coupling is local in the * r*-space , becomes@xmath54 above,@xmath55   ~\\left\\vert \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right\\rangle \\label{gbb'}%\\ ] ] and @xmath56 with an analogous expression for @xmath57 if we neglect continuum - continuum coupling and the width of the bins , the green s function becomes diagonal and eq.([vpol - cdcc1 ] ) becomes,@xmath58 clearly both expressions for @xmath35 above are highly non - local by construction . in addition , the inclusion of continuum - continuum couplings produces further non - local effects @xcite .",
    "it is easier to deal with an @xmath35 having the form of eq.([vpol - cdcc2 ] ) . how to find an equivalent no - continuum - continuum - coupling polarization potential ? to answer this question we rely on our recent work on the excitation of giant resonances in heavy ion reactions .",
    "one usually excites a given state , which itself is coupled to many other excited states . using the exit doorway idea @xcite , namely the excitation of these other states from the ground state proceeds from the exit doorway(s )",
    ", one is bound to attach a width to the exit doorways . labelling the doorway states by @xmath59 ,",
    "the green function takes the diagonal form@xmath60 the energies @xmath61 appearing in @xmath62 are complex .",
    "the width of any given _ d_-state measures the strength of the continuum - continuum coupling .",
    "the above expression for @xmath63 with complex @xmath64 , should be a faithful representation the full green function with continuum - continuum coupling . in the following we consider a much simpler two - channel case to discuss the notion of equivalent _ l_-independent polarization potential , and",
    "leave the discussion of the continuum - continuum case to a future publication .",
    "one frequently perform angular momentum projections in the schrdinger equation . for the simple case of a scalar hamiltonian with scalar coupling ,",
    "one makes the expansions    @xmath65    the angular - momentum projected version of eq.([loc - pol ] ) is the local equivalent polarization potential ,    @xmath66    this potential should be included in the hamiltonian for optical model calculations of the elastic radial wave function , @xmath67 it this way , one needs a different polarization potential for each partial wave .",
    "the polarization potential of eq.([upol - barl ] ) is not very useful , since it requires the knowledge of the exact radial wave function in the elastic channel , @xmath68 determining @xmath69 is as hard as solving the original cc equations .  a rather widely used approximation for the _ l_-dependent local polarization potential consists of replacing @xmath69 by the optical radial wave function , @xmath70 which is the solution of the partial - wave projected schrdinger equation with the polarization potential switched off .",
    "this potential , denoted by @xmath71 , is @xmath72    a further inconvenience of trivially local equivalent potentials is that they have poles wherever the radial wave function vanishes . in what follows",
    "we discuss three different prescriptions for obtaining @xmath2- independent polarization potentials free of poles@xmath73",
    "thompson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the following definition of an @xmath2-independent version of the polarization potential , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the transmission coefficient in the elastic channel for the @xmath76 partial - wave .",
    "the above definition of @xmath77 guarantees that no poles remain in the polarization potential , which arise from the presence of @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ vpolt ] ) . furthermore , owing to the presence of @xmath75 in the @xmath2-sum , only values of @xmath2 where @xmath75 is close to unity will contribute .",
    "of course the probability density @xmath79 is small for small values of @xmath2 due to absorption .",
    "thus , in the prescription of thompson _ et al .",
    "( [ vpolt ] ) should contain contributions of @xmath2 in the vicinity of the grazing one .",
    "we doubt that this is guaranteed always since there is interference effects in @xmath79 which may end up allowing the contribution of small @xmath2 as well .",
    "this prescription has been recently used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the continuum discretized coupled channels calculation of break up and elastic scattering of @xmath80b .",
    "we now introduce a slightly modified version of the above discussed prescription , by substituting @xmath75 by its derivative with respect to @xmath2 , namely , @xmath81 the modified thompson prescription ( mt ) above guarantees the contribution of the @xmath82values around the grazing one , regardless to the behavior of  @xmath79 .",
    "one physical motivation for choosing @xmath83 instead of @xmath75 is that the dwba amplitudes of non - elastic processes in the adiabatic limit do behave as the @xmath82derivative of the elastic @xmath84-matrix elements , which enters in the definition of @xmath85 .",
    "this prescription relies on the semiclassical idea that the orbital angular momentum , if treated classically , should be related to @xmath86 and the energy @xmath87 through the definition of the classical turning point @xmath88 , namely @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the real part of the optical potential containing the nuclear and the coulomb pieces .",
    "it is clear that , for a given collision energy , @xmath91 is a function of @xmath92  the prescription consists of identifying @xmath93 in order to build the @xmath2-independent polarization potential , @xmath94 using eq.([vpolsc ] ) , one gets the potential @xmath95 at a discrete set of _ r_-values ( one for each partial - wave ) and interpolating between these points one obtains a continuous function .",
    "all three _",
    "l_-independent potentials discussed above contain a further energy dependence , besides the one that arises from the green function in the polarization potential .",
    "this extra energy dependence is non - dispersive and thus could render the applicability of the dispersion relation questionable .",
    "we shall verify this point in the following section .    in all of the above prescriptions the starting point is the trivially - equivalent local potential obtained from angular momentum projected versions of eqs.([upol - rr ] ) and ( [ loc - pol ] ) , or the solution of the cc equations used in eq.([nova - eq ] ) .",
    "this will be shown in detail in the next section .",
    "we have chosen the system @xmath0li + @xmath1c to test the different local approximations for the polarization potential discussed in the previous sections . we have decided not to consider the coupling to the continuum explicitly , but rather representing the continuum by a single bound effective channel .",
    "it is clear that this is not an appropriate representation for the continuum",
    ". one obvious shortcoming of this model is that it does not contain continuum - continuum couplings , which is known to play an important role in nuclear reactions with weakly bound projectiles @xcite .",
    "the justification for considering this schematic application is that our purpose is to compare different approximations for the polarization potential , rather than to perform quantitative calculations of elastic or fusion cross sections .",
    "the two cc equations used in our calculation can be easily readout from eqs .",

    "one would expect the dispersion relation to be satisfied by @xmath152 only if @xmath69 is real , which is certainly not the case .",
    "however , a remnant of the dispersion relation should still be seen in @xmath152 as has been shown over and over again in the study of the threshold anomaly @xcite . not withstanding the above reservations we will give below an account of our calculation of the equivalent _ l_-independent potential .    in figure 1",
    "we show polarization potentials at the collision energies ( a ) @xmath153 mev , ( b ) @xmath154 mev and ( c ) @xmath155 mev .",
    "we present results obtained using the thompson ( t ) prescription ( eq.([vpolt ] ) ) , the modified thompson one ( mt ) ( eq.([vpoltm ] ) ) and the semiclassical prescription ( sc ) ( eq.([vpolsc ] ) ) . in the cases of the t and the mt potentials",

    "we see clearly that whereas the @xmath159 is quite oscillatory , the t , mt and sc ones seem to behave smoothly in so far as the real part of the potential is concerned . oscillations in @xmath160 occur near the nodes of @xmath161 .",
    "since this wave function is complex and their real and imaginary parts do not vanish simultaneously , the polarization potential remains finite .    in figure 2",

    "the mt seems to be quite off , however on the average it works well too .",
    "finally , to be sure about the consistency of our calculation we have checked the dispersion relation .",
    "we have fixed @xmath165 fm and plotted in figure 4 the resulting behavior of the real and imaginary parts of the polarization potential @xmath166 .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath152 for @xmath157 shows the general trend of what one would expect from the dispersion relation : maxima in the real part accompanied by sharp variations in the imaginary part .",
    "similar behavior is found for the t potential .",
    "note the unphysical sharp oscillations of the sc potentials .",
    "they arise from the fact that this potential can only be evaluated over a sparse mesh of r - values , correponding to the turning points at each angular momentum .",
    "thus the t and @xmath152 potentials exhibit the threshold anomaly @xcite . in particular , the t potential shows a maximum in the imaginary part at @xmath167 mev , whereas the real part shows a maximum at @xmath168 mev .",
    "this behavior of the t - potential is in line with the breakup threshold anomaly of ref . @xcite .",
    "in this work we have investigated @xmath169 polarization potentials in a schematic two - channel model , in which the range of the polarization potentials is equivalent to that associated with the breakup channel .",
    "we used several prescriptions to derive @xmath169 polarization potential and found that none could reproduce satisfactorily the results of coupled channel calculations .",
