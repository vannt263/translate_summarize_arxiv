    "in addition , other possible superslow x - ray pulsar candidates were reported recently : 1e 161348 - 5055 in the young supernova remnant rcw 103 ( @xmath13hr , de luca et al .",

    ", scaledwidth=110.0% ]    the spin period evolution of the new - born neutron star generally undergoes three states ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) : an _ ejector state _ in which neutron star spins down through the conventional spin - powered pulsar energy - loss mechanisms ; a _ propeller state _ in which spin period decreases by means of interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere and stellar wind of the companion ; and an _ accretor state _ in which the spin period of neutron star reaches a critical value , and the neutron star begins to accrete materials on to the surface , then switches on as the x - ray pulsar . the critical period is defined by equating the corotational radius of the neutron star to the magnetospheric radius , which induces the longest period of several hundred seconds but less than @xmath16 1000 s for the neutron star of magnetic field @xmath17 g. then what channels produce the superlong spin period higher than 1000s ? thus , detailed studies of these superslow x - ray pulsars will help us to understand the evolution of neutron star binaries and physical nature of these sources .",
    "with the long - term integral monitoring observations , we derived the orbital phase - resolved spectral properties for two superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars 4u 2206 + 54 and 2s 0114 + 65 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the spectra are fitted with the absorbed power - law model plus high energy cut - off .",
    "the spectral variations in both two sources show a common property .",
    "there exist anti - correlations between the flux and hydrogen column density / photon index , i.e. , a lower column density and harder spectrum around maximum of x - ray flux .",
    "these spectral behaviour over the orbital phase suggested that they should belong to highly obscured x - ray binary systems .",
    "in addition , we detected two cyclotron absorption lines at @xmath18 kev and @xmath19 kev in 4u 2206 + 54 during an active state ( wang 2009 ) , suggesting a magnetized neutron star with the magnetic field of @xmath20 g located in the binary if assuming the electron absorption case .",
    "unfortunately , we have not found evidence for the magnetic neutron star in 2s 0114 + 65 with different observations ( wang 2011 ) . while a high energy tail was discovered in the x - ray spectrum of 2s 0114 + 65 ( wang 2011 ) . with detailed studies",
    "show that high column density may lead to the disappearance of the hard x - ray tails in the spectra : when the derived values of column density are higher than @xmath21 @xmath22 , no hard x - ray tails are detected .",
    "how to produce the hard x - ray tails above 70 kev for accreting neutron stars in high mass x - ray binaries especially in the wind - fed accretion systems is unclear .",
    "it is possible that hot corona exists near neutron stars for wind - fed accretion systems like 2s 014 + 65 ; and the dense accretion materials or strong winds prevent the formation of hot corona or depress the comptonization effects .",
    "the long - term monitoring observations also discovered the spin evolution of these superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars . in fig .  3 , we have presented the spin evolution of 4u 2206 + 54 and 2s 0114 + 65 respectively .",
    "the pulsar in 4u 2206 + 54 undergone a long - term spin - down trend in the last twenty years with an average spin - down rate of @xmath23s s@xmath3 by different measurements ( wang 2010 , 2012 ; finger et al .",
    "2010 ; reig et al .",
    "but the spin period of the neutron star in 2s 0114 + 65 varies from 2.73hr around 1986 to 2.63hr around 2008 ( wang 2011 ) with the present spin - up rate of @xmath24s s@xmath3 .",
    "additionally , the spin - up rate of the neutron star in 2s 0114 + 65 seems to be accelerating ( see fig .",
    "a slow rotation neutron star of @xmath6s was also discovered in a be x - ray transient sxp 1062 ( henault - brunet et al .",
    "2012 ) . during a giant outburst",
    ", a very fast spin - down rate of @xmath25s s@xmath3 is discovered in this x - ray pulsar ( haberl et al .",
    "discovery of these superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars provides the challenge to the present evolution model of x - ray binaries .",
    "then what is physical origin for long spin period neutron stars ?    li & van den heuvel ( 1999 ) have suggested that neutron star spins down to the spin period range longer than 1000 s if the neutron star was born as a magnetar with an initial magnetic field @xmath26 g. this ultra - strong magnetic field could decay to the normal value ranges of @xmath27 g within a few million years , so that superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars may be defined as magnetar descendants .",
    "the alternative suggestion proposed by ikhsanov ( 2007 ) shows that an additional evolution phase _ subsonic propeller _ state between the transition from known _ supersonic propeller _ state to _ accretor _ state could allow the spin period increases up to several thousand seconds without the assumption of magnetars , which is the so - called break period given by : p_br 2000 m_ns1.4m_^-4/21[b_surf0.3b_cr]^16/21[m 10 ^ 15 g s^-1]^-5/7 s , where @xmath28 is the surface magnetic field of the neutron star .",
    "however , if the above formula is applied to the case of 4u 2206 + 54/2s 0114 + 65 , one find the surface magnetic field higher than @xmath29 g.    the fast spin - down rate is discovered in two superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars 4u 2206 + 54 and sxp 1062 . according to the standard evolutionary scenario , the maximum spin - down rate in the accretor stage is @xmath30 , which implies @xmath31 g for 4u 2206 + 54 and sxp 1062 .    recently , a new theory of quasi - spherical accretion for x - ray pulsars is developed ( shakura et al .",
    "2012 ) , the magnetic field in wind - fed neutron star systems is given by b_12~8.1m^1/3_16v^-11/3_300(p_1000p_orb300)^11/12 g. this also gives the ultrastrong magnetic field of @xmath32 g.    thus , these superslow pulsation pulsars could be accreting magnetars !",
    "it is still quite interesting that the discovery of the cyclotron absorption line feature around 30 kev would suggest a magnetic field of 3@xmath33 g for the electron cyclotron absorption case , but a magnetic field of @xmath34 g for the proton cyclotron line assumption . thus , difficulty and uncertainties in explaining the long spin period still exist .",
    "it is possible that superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars may not follow the present standard evolution models in close binaries .",
    "the superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars undergo the fast spin evolution , not reaching the equilibrium .",
    "we suggested the possible evolution track among the superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars and supergiant binaries .",
    "superslow pulsation x - ray pulsars should be younger binary systems , and after rapid spin - down and spin - up phases , they will become supergiant x - ray binaries in the equilibrium spin - period range .",
