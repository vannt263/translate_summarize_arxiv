    "a network , or graph , consists of a set of nodes , from which selected pairs are connected by edges .",
    "such mathematical constructions provide a useful description for systems of interacting objects .",
    "more specifically , network concepts are used in the analysis of chemical and metabolic systems as well as food webs and social networks . in recent years , there has been much progress in the analysis of the topology of these networks .",
    "the network topology can be characterized by features such as the number of nodes , @xmath0 , and the average degree @xmath1 $ ] , namely the average number of edges that are connected to a node . a more detailed description of the network topology is given by the degree distribution , @xmath2 , which is the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly @xmath3 edges .",
    "another important topological feature measures the tendency of a network to support the formation of cliques .",
    "a clique is a fully connected set of nodes , namely each pair of nodes in such a set is connected by an edge .",
    "the tendency of a network to form cliques can be characterized by the clustering coefficient @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "when a network has a high clustering coefficient it is considered to be highly connected .",
    "a low clustering coefficient implies that the network is only loosely connected .",
    "networks exhibit a unique metric , in which the distance , @xmath4 , between any two nodes is given by the minimal number of edges one has to cross in order to pass from one node to the other . in some cases",
    ", the distance can be used as a measure for the connection between a pair of nodes .",
    "this is based on the assumption that two directly reacting nodes ( @xmath5 ) strongly affect each other , whereas distant nodes weakly affect one another .",
    "the average path length in a network , @xmath6 $ ] , is obtained by averaging over the distance between all pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "the parameters defined above were evaluated for random graphs and their dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath7 was found @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of realistic networks shows that they are very different from random graphs @xcite . in realistic networks",
    "it is common to find surprisingly low average path lengths , and relatively high clustering coefficients . in many cases",
    "the degree distribution follows a power law form , rather than the poisson distribution which is the signature of random networks .",
    "these features were found to appear in social networks @xcite , the world wide web @xcite , ecological networks @xcite , and metabolic networks @xcite .    while the topological properties of realistic networks have been elucidated , the implications on the functionality of these networks are not fully understood . the small average path length and the high clustering of many realistic networks ,",
    "render them as small world networks . at first glance ,",
    "the small world characteristics imply that realistic networks function as highly connected systems .",
    "indeed , one expects that if the distance between two nodes is small , the correlation between them will be strong .",
    "for instance , in the case of a metabolic network , the concentrations of interacting proteins will strongly depend on each other .",
    "a perturbation in the concentration of one protein is likely to affect the concentration of the other .",
    "this might lead to the conclusion that small world networks are highly susceptible to local perturbations , as almost all the nodes are just a short distance away .",
    "the problem with this topological analysis , is that it does not relate to the specific function of a given network or to the strength of the interactions between its nodes @xcite .",
    "consider , for instance , a metabolic network and an ecological network sharing the same topology . in what sense",
    "can these two networks be regarded as similar networks ? even if the two have the same topological structure , the nature of their functional behavior is fundamentally different .",
    "the process of predation may lead to different behavior than the process of chemical reaction between proteins .",
    "even two metabolic networks may function differently if the interaction strengths in one network are higher than in the other .    in this paper",
    ", we present a method for obtaining the correlation matrix of a given network .",
    "the elements of this matrix provide the magnitudes of the correlations between pairs of nodes in the network . in certain cases",
    "the matrix can be used to characterize some of the global features of the network s functionality .",
    "for instance , it can be used to identify domains of high correlations versus domains of low correlations .",
    "another use of the correlation matrix is in quantifying the connectivity of a network in a way that accounts both for its topology and for the specific processes taking place between its nodes .",
    "this method , referred to as the network correlation function ( ncf ) method , enables us to determine whether a topological small world ( tsw ) network will also be a functional small world ( fsw ) network .",
    "a network will be regarded as an fsw network if the correlations between its nodes are typically high , and thus the state of one node is highly dependent on that of the others . here",
    "we apply the method to metabolic networks with various topologies and different interaction strengths . in these networks ,",
    "each node represents a reactant , and is assigned a dynamical variable that accounts for the concentration of this reactant .",
    "the time dependence of these concentrations is described by a set of rate equations .",
    "the equations include terms that describe the interaction processes in the given network .",
    "they account both for the topology and for the functionality of the network . from the solution of the rate equations under steady state conditions",
    "one can extract the correlation between each pair of nodes . in certain cases ,",
    "networks are found to have a typical correlation length .",
    "if the distance between two nodes is much higher than this length , the correlation between them is negligible . to quantify the connectivity of the network ,",
    "one compares the correlation length with the average path length . in case that the average path length is smaller than the typical correlation length",
    ", the network will be considered as an fsw network . in this case",
    ", local perturbations will have a global effect on the network .",
    "the fsw network will thus be regarded as strongly connected . on the other hand ,",
    "if the average path length is larger than the typical correlation length , the network will be considered as weakly connected .",

    "it turns out that the effect of these nodes on each other is stronger than the effect they have on their adjacent nodes from the core .",
    "this is even though the topological distance between peripheral nodes is @xmath173 , while the distance between them and the central nodes is @xmath5 . a small perturbation in a peripheral node results in a very minor effect on all the central nodes .",

    "below we show an additional numerical example , where we continue the analysis to obtain the correlation length , @xmath47 , and the connectivity @xmath93 .",
    "one of the common characteristics of many realistic networks is their degree distribution that follows a power law , namely @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 are positive constants @xcite .",
    "ecological networks , social networks and metabolic networks are characterized by power - law degree distributions , and are referred to as scale - free networks .",
    "such networks include some nodes , called hubs , with a degree which is orders of magnitude higher than the average degree in the network .",
    "scale free networks are considered as highly connected , because due to these hubs the average path length between nodes is small .",
    "in fact , in metabolic networks the average path length was found to be as small as @xmath6 \\simeq 3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "below we examine a scale free network which is a tsw network , and determine whether it is also an fsw network .    to construct a scale free network we use the preferential attachment algorithm @xcite . in this algorithm",

    "when the interaction is dominant ( @xmath134 ) , correlations are maintained over long distances . by fitting the correlation functions to exponential functions ( solid lines )",

    "we have presented the ncf method for the analysis and evaluation of the connectivity of interaction networks .",
    "the method complements the topological analysis of networks , taking into account the functional nature of the interactions and their strengths .",

    "for instance , one can identify domains of high and low correlations .",
    "in other cases it is more insightful to extract the macroscopic characteristics of the network from the matrix .",
    "in particular , we have shown how to calculate the typical correlation length of the network .",
    "this correlation length , which has to do with the functionality of the network , can be compared to topological characteristics such as the average minimum path length of the network .",
    "the ratio between these two lengths provides the characteristic connectivity of the network .",
    "it was shown that the topological analysis alone is not sufficient in order to characterize the functionality of a network .",
    "for instance , networks with small world topology may display low connectivity , while networks that do not exhibit small world topology may display high connectivity .",
    "this is because in terms of the functionality of the network , when the correlation length is large , even distant species may be highly correlated .",
    "we demonstrated the method for metabolic networks with different topological structures , and identified the regimes of low connectivity and of high connectivity . as expected , these regimes depend on topological features , such as the number of species or the average minimum path length between pairs of species .",
    "however , they also depend on functional features such as the type of interactions in the network and the rate constants of the different processes .",
    "the ncf method was demonstrated for metabolic networks , but its applicability is much wider .",
    "in fact , the method could be applied to any reaction network that can be modeled by rate equations .",
    "such networks include metabolic networks @xcite , chemical networks @xcite , gene expression networks @xcite and ecological networks @xcite .",
    "it is common to use rate equations for the modeling of these types of networks . in certain models of social networks ,",
    "the flow of information as well as the spreading of viruses can also be described by rate equations .",
    "the method is not suitable for obtaining the correlations in ising type models , where the nodes are assigned discrete variables , which can not be modeled using continuous equations .",
    "the number of elements in the correlation matrix is equal to the number of pairs of nodes in the system .",
    "when applying the ncf method , one writes a single linear equation for each matrix element .",
    "thus , from a computational point of view , the scaling of the ncf method is quadratic in the number of reactive species .",
    "this enables the application of the method to networks which include even thousands of nodes .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the application of the method to the other types of interaction networks mentioned above .",
    "a few examples are addressed below .",
    "consider , for example , gene expression networks .",
    "these networks consist of genes and proteins that interact with each other .",
    "in addition to protein - protein interactions , already analyzed in the context of metabolic networks , genetic networks include transcriptional regulation processes , where some genes regulate the expression of other genes . in recent years",
    ", much information has been acquired about the topology of these networks , for certain organisms such as _ escherichia coli _ @xcite .",
    "the problem is that these networks are very elaborate , and may consist of thousands of nodes .",
    "this limits our ability to simulate their functionality , and thus , currently most of the theoretical and computational analysis of these networks is focused on small modules @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "one performs simulations of small subnetworks consisting of only a few nodes .",
    "these subnetworks are expected to play specific roles in the functionality of the network as a whole .",
    "such approach is valid if an isolated module maintains its function when incorporated in a large network in which it interacts with many other genes .",
    "we expect the analysis presented here to provide some insight on this matter . by obtaining the complete correlation matrix",
    ", one can characterize the dependence of different proteins and genes on one another .",
    "the network may then be divided into subnetworks , grouping together nodes that are highly correlated , and excluding ones that are not .",
    "it is expected that these modules will not function significantly differently when analyzed in the context of the surrounding network nodes .",
    "in addition , the typical correlation length will provide us with an approximate radius beyond which correlations may be neglected . to simulate a module properly",
    ", one needs to include all the nodes which are within that radius from the module .",
    "other possible applications regard social networks .",
    "for instance , the process of viral spreading could be analyzed @xcite .",
    "many social networks are known to be small world networks .",
    "however , this does not mean that any contagious disease spreads rapidly .",
    "this is , possibly , because for certain diseases the correlation length is small .",
    "using the method presented here , one can obtain this correlation length , taking into account the specific rate constants of the viral flow .",
    "the recent applications of graph theory to many natural macroscopic systems was enabled by focusing on their topology .",
    "this approach has been very fruitful , as it uncovered the mutual structure of networks from many different fields . in particular , the ubiquity of the scale free degree distribution , and the small world topology was found .",
    "however , it still is not completely clear what functional meaning can be given to these topological properties in different contexts .",
    "a recently proposed approach derives the key aspects of the network functionality from its topological structure @xcite .",
    "other approaches use the ising hamiltonian to describe the interaction pattern between nodes on scale free and small world networks @xcite . functional characteristics such as phase transitions , and critical exponents",
    "are then observed .",
    "the ncf method presented in this paper complements these approaches .",
    "it can be applied to a variety of different interaction processes , such as metabolic , ecological or social interactions , all of which can be described by rate equations .",
