    "the eip on @xmath7 is to minimize @xmath13 given @xmath14 . in general",
    "the eip is a hard problem ( np - complete ) , but certain special cases of interest for computer science and engineering have been solved .",
    "the author s first paper , written fifty years ago ( 1962 ) , solved the eip for the graph of the @xmath15-cube .",
    "the concept of steiner operation ( _ stop _ ) was the result of a deliberate effort , beginning around 1976 , to identify morphisms for combinatorial isoperimetric problems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic theory and results that followed were surveyed in @xcite , published in 2004 .",
    "there , on pages 27 - 28 a stop is characterized as a set - map , @xmath16 , @xmath1 being a finite set with _",

    "@xmath4 does not increase the size of their boundaries : @xmath20 , 3 .",
    "@xmath4 preserves the structure of @xmath21 : @xmath22 , @xmath23__. _ _",
    "the original family of stops @xcite , called _ stabilization _ , was derived from reflective symmetry of a graph embedded in euclidean space , @xmath24 ( _ e.g. _ the graph of the @xmath15-cube ) .",
    "rota s observation that stabilization is a discrete analog of steiner symmetrization ( see @xcite and @xcite for background on steiner symmetrization or google `` steiner symmetrization '' ) added considerable _ gravitas _ to the project .",
    "later it was discovered that stabilization is also a stop for the vertex - isoperimetric problem ( vip ) on the graph , @xmath25 ( the boundary , @xmath26 , is the set of vertices in @xmath12 with neighbors in @xmath11 ) .",
    "also there is another whole class of systematic stops , called _",
    "compression_. compression is based on a product decomposition of @xmath7 , one of the factors having nested solutions for the isoperimetric problem . unlike stabilization , compression had been discovered independently many times , appearing in the majority of papers on combinatorial isoperimetric problems ( see @xcite or @xcite for more background and details ) . furthermore , steiner symmetrization and most of its variants ( such as schwartz symmetrization ) are compressions",
    ".    properties ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) above may be regarded as axioms for stops .",
    "however , in the light of experience and expedience , we wish to extend these axioms a bit .",
    "first by allowing the domain and codomain of a stop to be the more general @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 being a partial order relation on @xmath1 and @xmath27 the set of all ideals of @xmath2 ( for definitions see sec",
    ". 2.1 ) . in scheduling problems , where @xmath1 is a set of tasks",
    ", @xmath2 represents precedence constraints under which the tasks must be performed .",
    "no task may be worked on until all its antecedents have been completed . also , as mentioned in our abstract and demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "such restrictions on the domain of a stop arise from steiner operations themselves .",
    "stops were created to help solve combinatorial isoperimetric problems .",
    "these problems may , in principle , be solved by brute force , trying out all possibilities in the domain , @xmath27 . however , if @xmath27 is large , the cost may be prohibitive",
    ". the range of @xmath4 will generally be much smaller than its domain , but to be able to take advantage of the reduction in size we must have a simple way to identify sets in @xmath30 and to generate them all efficiently .",
    "this fundamental technical problem in the theory of stops was apparent right from the start , with stabilization , and an effective answer was found ( see @xcite ) . for the edge- and vertex - isoperimetric problems on graphs ,",
    "the initial domain is @xmath31 , all subsets , so @xmath2 @xmath32 the discrete order on @xmath1 .",
    "it was observed that each of the basic stabilization operations , defined by a reflective symmetry and a point not on the fixed hyperplane of the reflection ( the fricke - klein point ) , induced a simple partial order on @xmath1 .",
    "the basic stabilizations , with a common fricke - klein point so that they all had a common total extension ( are _ consistent _ ) , could be composed , giving a stop that combined the simplifications of its constituents .",
    "surprisingly , although basic stabilizations were idempotent ( _ i.e. _ @xmath33 , their compositions were generally not .",
    "however , if repeatedly ( cyclically ) composed , they would eventually become constant and therefore idempotent .",
    "the range of this superstabilization was then characterized ( theorem 4 of @xcite ) as @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the transitive closure of the union of all the basic partial orders .",
    "later on the author was pleasantly surprised to note that compression fit into the same theoretical framework : basic compressions are idempotent steiner operations , each defining a partial order on @xmath1 .",
    "if consistent , compressions could be cyclically composed to give an idempotent stop combining all their simplifications into one .",
    "the range of that supercompression is exactly the set of all ideals of the transitive closure of the union of the basic partial orders ( see @xcite , section 3.3.4 ) .",
    "also , all _ ad hoc _ ( unsystematic ) steiner operations have been found to have partial orders representing their ranges .",
    "all of these stops and their associated stop - orders share the property that @xmath36 is `` lower '' ( wrt the stop - order ) than @xmath11 . in each case",
    "this is justified by a one - to - one function , @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , the definition of @xmath39 depending on the definition of @xmath36 .",
    "this leads us to add a fourth axiom :    1 .",
    "@xmath40a total extension @xmath41 ( @xmath42 one - to - one and onto so @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . also ,",
    "with @xmath45 defined to be @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    for stabilizations , @xmath42 is the order induced by proximity to the fricke - klein point . for compressions",
    "it is the total order of the inductive hypothesis .",
    "if a set of stops share a common @xmath42 they are called _ consistent_. axiom 4 makes the repeated compositions of consistent stops eventually constant since @xmath51 can only decrease a finite number of times .",
    "the requirement of consistency is a pragmatic one .",
    "compositions of stops that are not consistent would still be stops but their composition could cycle and may not become constant .",
    "the reduction in size of the range achieved by the composition of consistent stops is seems to be more than that achieved by identifying equivalence classes of sets .",
    "a good example of that is the solution of the edge - isoperimetric problem on @xmath52 , the graph of the 600-vertex regular solid in 4 dimensions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the brute force solution would generate all @xmath53subsets of vertices , an impossible task .",
    "the symmetry group of @xmath52 is of order @xmath54 ( see coxeter s classic monograph @xcite ) so there are at least @xmath55 equivalence classes of sets of vertices .",
    "that is still a huge number and it is not even clear how to generate those equivalence classes efficiently .",
    "however , @xmath52 has @xmath56 reflective symmetries and the superstabilization they generate has about @xmath57 sets in its range .",
    "those sets are ideals in the stabilization - order ( aka the bruhat order ) of @xmath52 and can be recursively generated in lexicographic order very efficiently .",
    "a brute force solution of the edge - isoperimetric problem on @xmath52 ( generating all @xmath58 sets in the range of its superstabilization ) was carried out on a 3 mghz pc in one day .",
    "we also modify the second axiom by extending `` size of the boundary '' to any functional , @xmath59 , requiring that    1 .",
    "@xmath4 does not increase the size of their boundaries : @xmath60 .",
    "the author s monograph @xcite treats concrete steiner operations ( stops ) , principally stabilization & compression , and the partial orders ( stop - orders ) that characterize their ranges .",
    "these concepts systematically simplify hard problems , pointing the way to subsequent developments such as passage to a continuous limit . rather than survey the whole book here",
    ", we just give a glimpse of the culminating application , the solution of a problem posed by a. a. sapozhenko .",
    "it demonstrates the power and efficiency of steiner operations and their stop - orders .",
    "sapozhenko asked about the vip on the johnson graph , @xmath61 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath61 are @xmath15-tuples of 0s & 1s with exactly @xmath62 1s .",
    "two such vertices are neighbors if they differ in exactly two places . @xmath61 does not have nested solutions for @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath61 is not factorable as a product , so even the nested solutions of @xmath64 can not be used for compression .",
    "the most successful strategy for solving combinatorial isoperimetric problems without nested solutions has been to pass to a continuous limit and apply calculus ( see chapter 10 of @xcite ) .",
    "this works for several other problems lacking nested solutions : the eip on @xmath65 ( the @xmath62-fold product of @xmath15-cycles ) and the vip on @xmath66 , ( the @xmath62-fold product of complete graphs on @xmath15 vertices ) .",
    "the ( 1-dimensional ) compression - order for both @xmath67 & @xmath68 is @xmath69 and the limit of @xmath70 as @xmath71 is @xmath72   ^{d}$ ] , the unit @xmath62-cube .",
    "of course @xmath72   ^{d } $ ] has different boundaries for the limits of the eip & vip .",
    "bollobas & leader solved the eip on @xmath72   ^{d}$ ] with a discontinuous modification of compression ( relaxation of axiom 3 and induction on @xmath62 ) .",
    "the present author solved the vip on @xmath72   ^{d}$ ] with a discontinuous modification of stabilization .",
    "it is not apparent how to pass to a continuous limit with @xmath61 but stabilization with respect to the symmetric group acting on its coordinates transforms it so that the limit becomes obvious .",
    "the limit of the stabilization - order of @xmath61 ( as @xmath71 ) is the continuous poset , @xmath73   ^{d}:x_{1}\\leq x_{2}\\leq ... \\leq x_{d}\\right\\ }   , \\ ] ] ordered coordinatewise ( see section 10 of @xcite for details ) .",
    "the solution of sapozhenko s problem follows immediately from the symmetry of the solution of the vip on @xmath72   ^{d}$ ] .",
    "the logic of the solution is the same as that given in elementary books for the reduction of dido s problem to the classical isoperimetric problem in the plane , a `` didonean embedding '' of @xmath74 into @xmath72   ^{d}$ ] ( see @xcite , chapter 10 for details ) .",
    "one might expect that the eip on @xmath61 could be similarly solved .",
    "however , the solution of the eip on @xmath61 is not symmetric under interchange of coordinates , so the embedding is not didonean . despite considerable effort",
    ", the author has not been able to adapt the techniques that solved the eip & vip on @xmath72   ^{d}$ ] to solve the eip on @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath75 ) .",
    "it remains an open problem .      with all those `` coincidences '' , the range of so many different steiner operations , @xmath76 being represented as @xmath77 for some @xmath78 , it was natural to wonder if _ every _ stop has such a partial order characterizing its range ?",
    "we kept coming back to this question because of the efficacy and power of stop - orders , but each time were brought up short by the lack of any obvious source for the additional order relations .",
    "where could they possibly come from ?",

    ". ordered by @xmath239 , these spheres form a chain , isomorphic to @xmath315 , which constitutes the symmetrization - order .    we began the search for a nontrivial stop - order with antonio ros s survey of classical isoperimetric problems @xcite .",

    "in addition we may apply stabilization , the steiner operation based on the reflective symmetries induced by interchanging coordinates .",
    "the definition of stabilization for continuous isoperimetric problems is the same as for combinatorial ones ( see section 3.2.4 of @xcite ) and is closely related to hsiang symmetrization ( @xcite , section 1.3 ) .",

    "the same holds in any dimension but of course it gets more complex ( for @xmath335 ( fig .",
    "4.3 of @xcite ) there are 14 candidates ) .",
    "there are further interaction between the local ( variational ) and global ( steiner operational ) conditions for an optimal surface : the regularity of the surface implies it has a normal ( directed outward ) at every point@xmath336 in order for the region enclosed to be an ideal in the stop - order , that normal vector must lie in the positive orthant .",
    "also , where the surface meets the boundaries of the cube , the normal vector must be orthogonal to the normal of the bounding face . where the surface intersects a hyperplane of symmetry of the @xmath62-cube , @xmath72   ^{d}$ ] , the dihedral angle between the tangent plane and plane of symmetry must be acute ( nonnegative inner product between their normal vectors ) .",
    "the strongest local condition is that the mean curvature of the surface must be constant .    in combinatorial isoperimetric problems ( such as the edge - isoperimetric problem on the graph of the d - cube )",
    "the notion of `` nested solutions '' is fundamental . if one assumes that the problem might have nested solutions , then starting with the empty set and adding in elements one at a time so as to minimize the marginal boundary , with relatively little effort one has candidates for solution sets of each cardinality .",
    "if those candidates withstand scrutiny , then one has a powerful tool ( compression ) for proving them optimal .",
    "the problems we are looking at now , however , are interesting just because they do not have nested solutions .",
    "but they may have them in a weaker sense .",
    "suppose we start off with the ideal of volume 0 corresponding to one of the ideals of stab(q_d ) , thinking of it as an empty balloon .",
    "pumping air into the balloon will increase the volume so as to minimize the marginal increase in area and should , intuitively , give a nested family of locally optimal ideals .",
    "conjecture 1 ( ritor ) of @xcite affirms this intuition in 3 dimensions .",
    "all we need to prove ritor s conjecture is an efficient analytic representation of all the locally optimal surfaces , but evidently they do not exist for the larger two ( lawson s and schwarz s surfaces ) .",
    "one might also hope to adapt bollobas & leader s discontinuous compression arguement to prove the @xmath317 analog of their @xmath318 theorem .",
    "however , we have not been able to do that either , and ros thinks there might be a counterexample  in higher dimensions .",
    "one of the notable controversies in mathematical history was weierstrass s challenge to jakob steiner s claim to have given a rigorous proof ( the first ) of the classical isoperimetric theorem ( _ circa _ 1836 , see @xcite , section v.11 .",
    ", p. 295 ) .",
    "steiner showed that symmetrization of a planar set ( wrt a given line through its centroid ) has the same area as the set and that the length of its boundary is less ( strictly ) unless the set was already symmetric  ( wrt the given line ) .",
    "since the only planar set symmetric wrt every line through its centroid is a circle , qed ( steiner claimed ) .",
    "weierstrass pointed out that steiner was implicitly assuming that the isoperimetric problem _ has _ a solution and he still needed to prove it for logical completeness .",
    "a proof of existence was finally published by schwartz in 1884 . according to berger @xcite , blaschke s proof of existence , based on a compactness argument , validated steiner s intuition .",
    "we are hopeful it can also prove that consistent steiner operations generate `` pushouts '' .",
    "the basic symmetrizations and their `` pushouts '' are idempotent .",
    "our demonstration that the range of an idempotent steiner operation is closed under @xmath128 @xmath150 @xmath129 does not invoke finiteness , so the ranges of the basic- and super - symmetrizations will be ( continuous ) distributive lattices .",
    "our hope is that a variant of the birkhoff - priestley representation theory for distributive lattices @xcite will produce its stop - order .",
    "it seems that there will have to be limitations on the closure of those lattices though , like the countable unions of measure theory .",
    "then the only subsets that need be considered in solving the isoperimetric problem would be ideals in the stabilization - order ( assuming that the birkhoff & priestley representation theories can produce a theoretical foundation for such things ) .",
    "it might seem that birkhoff s theorem was created to prove theorem 3 . however , birkhoff s theorem preceded theorem 3 by at least 60 years .",
    "also the essential idea behind the proof of birkhoff s theorem , the encoding of partial order relations into the algebra of lattices ( theorem 2.8 ( the connecting lemma ) & theorem 2.10 of @xcite ) , goes back another 60 years to dedekind .",
    "the proof of theorem 3 is so simple ( given birkhoff s theorem and its extensions ) yet gives no insight into the interaction between stops and the elements of the underlying set ( the join - irreducibles of @xmath337 ) .",
