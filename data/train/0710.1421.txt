    "regulation processes in cells are performed by networks of interacting genes , which regulate each other s synthesis . in recent years these networks",
    "have been studied extensively in different organisms @xcite .",
    "the networks include interactions at the level of transcriptional regulation @xcite as well as post - transcriptional regulation by protein - protein interactions @xcite . in attempt to understand the structure of the networks and their function",
    ", it was proposed that they exhibit a modular structure  @xcite with motifs , such as the feed forward loop  @xcite .",
    "other modules such as the genetic switch  @xcite and the mixed - feedback loop  @xcite also appear .",
    "however , it is not yet clear what is the connection between the evolutionary processes which determine the network structure and the functionality of these motifs @xcite .",
    "in addition to the genetic circuits found in natural organisms , it recently became possible to construct synthetic networks of a desired architecture @xcite .",
    "an important example of a synthetic circuit is the repressilator  @xcite , which was designed to exhibit oscillations , reminiscent of natural genetic oscillators such as the circadian rhythms .",
    "the repressilator circuit was encoded on plasmids in _ e. coli _ bacteria .",
    "the plasmids appeared in a low copy number of about four plasmids per cell .",
    "the reporter plasmid transcribing the gfp used for the measurements appeared in a higher copy number of around 65 plasmids per cell .",
    "the protein concentrations were measured vs. time in single cells .",
    "oscillations with a period of 160 @xmath0 40 minutes were found . note that this oscillation period was longer than the cell cycle , of about 50 - 70 minutes under the experimental conditions .",
    "the oscillations were noisy , typically maintaining phase coherence for only a few oscillation periods .",
    "in addition , the reporter gene expression exhibited a rising background level as time evolved .",
    "the repressilator circuit consists of three genes , denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which negatively regulate each other s synthesis in a cyclic fashion , namely @xmath1 regulates @xmath2 , @xmath2 regulates @xmath3 and @xmath3 regulates @xmath1 ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the regulation is performed by the transcription factors , or repressors , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , produced by genes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "when a repressor binds to the promoter site upstream of the regulated gene , it blocks the access of the rna polymerase , thus repressing the transcription process .    to understand the oscillatory behavior ,",
    "consider a situation in which the number of @xmath4 proteins is large . in this case",
    "it is likely that one of the @xmath4 proteins will bind to the @xmath2 promoter and will repress the production of @xmath5 proteins",
    ". the reduced level of @xmath5 proteins will enable the gene @xmath3 to be fully expressed and the number of @xmath6 proteins will increase and will start to repress gene @xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the number of @xmath4 proteins will decrease , and gene @xmath2 will be activated , completing a full cycle , in which the order of appearance of the dominant protein type is @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the repressilator circuit using deterministic methods ( rate - equations ) and stochastic methods ( direct numerical integration of the master equation and monte carlo simulations ) .",
    "recent advances in quantitative measurements of protein levels in single cells  @xcite gave rise to new insight into the importance of stochastic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the role of fluctuations is enhanced due to the discrete nature of the transcription factors and their binding sites , which may appear in low copy numbers  @xcite .",
    "using stochastic methods we examine the effect of fluctuations on the regularity , amplitude and frequency of the oscillations .",
    "in particular , we examine the effect of the number of binding sites by changing the number of plasmids in a cell .",
    "we find that when the number of plasmids in small , fluctuations are important and stochastic analysis is required . in the limit of a large number of plasmids the fluctuations decline and the deterministic and stochastic results coincide .",
    "we also consider the effects of features such as cooperative binding , the inclusion of the mrna level in the models and bound - repressor degradation .",
    "the appearance of oscillations turns out to be sensitive to such features and it is thus essential to study them in detail .",

    "therefore , the assumption of large copy numbers fails , and the validity of the rate - equations is questionable .    the rate - equations can describe the system in a correct manner only in the limit of high copy numbers of bound repressors .",
    "interestingly , this situation can , in fact , be realized in cells by placing the relevant genes on plasmids , as done in ref .",
    "plasmids are small circular segments of dna that may exist in the cell and can be inserted synthetically .",

    "here we assume , for simplicity , that the number of the binding sites is @xmath88 .",

    "this agreement is both qualitative and quantitative .",
    "qualitatively , for a high plasmid copy number , the system exhibits oscillations in the rate - equations if and only if it exhibits oscillations in the mc simulations .",
    "consider , for example , the repressilator with dimers and without brd , where the mrna level is taken into account .",
    "for @xmath94 the system exhibits oscillations in the rate - equations but not in the mc simulations . as @xmath88 increases ,",
    "the oscillations in the rate - equations disappear and become consistent with the mc results .    in case",
    "that the number of plasmids is small , the average period of the oscillations in the mc simulations may differ from the period obtained in the rate - equations .",
    "however , for a large number of plasmids , the oscillations obtained in the mc simulations become much more regular , and more similar in shape to those obtained from the rate - equations , with the same number of plasmids [ fig .",

    "the two periods converge towards each other [ fig .",

    "we have analyzed the genetic repressilator circuit using deterministic and stochastic methods .",
    "in particular , we examined the effects of cooperative binding , the degradation of bound repressors and the inclusion of the mrna level in the model .",
    "the qualitative results are summarized in table ii . due to",
    "the small numbers of proteins and binding sites , stochastic effects are significant and the deterministic analysis may fail .",
    "it fails qualitatively in the biologically relevant case in which there is cooperative binding , the mrna level is taken into account and no brd is assumed . in this case",
    "the rate - equations predict oscillations which do not appear in the stochastic analysis . in addition , even when the deterministic and stochastic methods agree about the existence of oscillations , there are quantitative differences in the period , amplitude and regularity of the oscillations as well as in the range of parameters in which they appear .",
    "since the repressilator was encoded on plasmids we have studied the effect of increasing the number of plasmids in a cell on the behavior of the system .",
    "we found that as the number of plasmids increases , the role of fluctuations is suppressed and the rate - equations become valid .",
    "the results show that varying the plasmid copy number may lead to qualitative changes in the dynamics of genetic circuits .",
    "this prediction can be tested experimentally in the context of synthetic biology and should be taken into account in the design of artifical genetic circuits .",
    "our results indicate that deterministic analysis is valid only in the limit in which all the components , namely mrnas and both free and bound proteins , appear in large copy numbers .",
    "this condition is not satisfied in genetic circuits encoded on the chromosome .",
