    "the stability problem for a schwarzschild black hole in the form of a  pure metric \" perturbation analysis was settled by t. regge and j. a. wheeler in a classic 1957 article @xcite .",
    "the main practical achievement of this work was undoubtedly the formulation of a gauge transformation approach that allows a complete radial / angular separation of the einstein equations in the two cases of odd and even parity , preliminarily established , reaching a formal solution in the axial ( or _ magnetic _ ) case : the so - called _ regge - wheeler equation_. due to mathematical complications , however , the full analysis was only completed thirteen years later , after the work of mathews @xcite , edelstein - vishveshwara @xcite and zerilli @xcite that either provided a more rigorous approach to the use of tensor harmonics , or resolved some compatibility problems in the analytic treatment of the system , or else provided the final form of the equation for the radial perturbation functions in the polar ( or _ electric _ ) case : the so - called _ zerilli equation_. the search for simplicity also led these authors to exploit some useful but not general relations between curvature tensors , like those derived by eisenhart @xcite , valid to the first order and/or only in the schwarzschild case ( latin tensor indices are used for consistency with the implemented algorithms ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the perturbation tensor and @xmath2 are the perturbed parts of the affine connections , ricci and einstein tensors .",
    "+ on this way , after having performed the gauge transformations for each parity case , we are left with two systems of , respectively , three and six independent radial ordinary differential equations in two ( namely @xmath3 ) and three ( namely @xmath4 ) arbitrary perturbation functions , to be determined .",
    "the magnetic system is straightforwardly reduced to a single first - order equation in @xmath5 which , by a simple variable substitution , leads to the final result : @xmath6q(r)=0\\ ] ] ( _ regge - wheeler equation _ ) , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the first called the _ tortoise coordinate _ by wheeler as a citation of the zeno paradox ) are ( implicitly or not ) defined by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are arbitrary functions to be determined in each particular case and @xmath11 , in this schrdinger - like equation , plays the role of an effective potential .",
    "+ finally , the electric system , by a more complex change of variables procedure , necessary to deal with the terms in the wave number @xmath12 , was found by zerilli @xcite to be represented by an equation formally equal to ( [ schr ] ) ( the _ zerilli equation _ ) only with a different ( but still algebraic ) expression of the potential . since all the variables of the system",
    "are mutually expressed by regular algebraic relations , the stability problem , analyzed by substituting different forms of @xmath12 into ( [ schr ] ) , can be extended in its validity to the whole perturbation .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that , with the essential help of computer algebra software , a similar analysis can be carried out for both parity cases , dealing with the more general spacetime of a spherical , non - rotating , eventually charged collapsed object , therefore allowing specialization not only to the schwarzschild but also to the reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "to begin a less rigid analysis than that induced by the formulation of equations ( 13 ) , we deal first of all with the full expression of the einstein tensor which , viewed as a function of the metric and its ordinary partial derivatives , reads as : +   + here , to the unperturbed metric , which refers to the usual covariant expression of the line element belonging to a generic spherically - symmetric expression depending on the radial arbitrary functions @xmath13 : @xmath14 must be added the perturbation terms , whose time dependency is represented only by a @xmath15 factor while the angular one is limited to functions of the polar angle @xmath16 .",
    "+ since `` * * components * * '' , mathtensor s routine for calculating curvature tensors from an input metric , has the useful feature of applying arbitrary combinations of mathematica commands to each component @xcite , the first order form of the einstein tensor can be readily obtained by appending to the metric input file , where the regge - wheeler - gauge perturbation terms are added with a  small parameter \" @xmath17 as a factor , a line like :    .... compsimp[a_]:=simplify[normal[series[expand[a],{q,0,1}]]/.q->1 ] ....      there are only three non - zero components @xmath18 of the tensor equation that replaces the ( 1 ) : @xmath19 ( where the subtracted quantity is the unperturbed metric tensor ) and that substantially reproduce , in their radial form , the solution system @xcite-(sys .",
    "2 ) , once the angular terms coming from the perturbation , where they are represented by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the legendre polynomial to the multipolar order @xmath22 ) , are fully simplified through the following relations : @xmath23\\\\ f'(\\theta)&=-l\\,(l+1)\\sin\\theta\\;p_{l}(\\cos\\theta)\\\\ f''(\\theta)&=l\\,(l+1)\\,[l\\;p_{l-1}(\\cos\\theta)-(l+1)\\cos\\theta\\ ; p_{l}(\\cos\\theta)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , being completely factored , are consequently eliminated .",
    "+ the first two equations ( from now on , almost everywhere in the rest of this paper , the notation @xmath24 will be adopted -not to be confused with the definition of the metric s radial function @xmath25 ! ) turn out to be of the first order with non - mixed dependence on the functions derivatives in such a way that a single second - order differential equation can be obtained by : +   + analyzing the dependence on @xmath12 , it is readily seen that to impose the equation ( [ schr ] ) with the conditions ( [ varch ] ) , a procedure of polynomial coefficient identification is required , carried out in the following way : +   +      here we deal with the seven non - zero components of the perturbed einstein tensor ( the complementary set with respect to the previous three  magnetic \" components ) , whose angular parts , coming from the perturbing gauge function @xmath26 , are factored , once the substitutions @xmath27\\\\ f''(\\theta)&=\\frac{l\\cos\\theta}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\;p_{l-1}(\\cos\\theta)-l\\,(\\cot^2\\theta+l+1)\\;p_{l}(\\cos\\theta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are performed , the resulting expressions simplified and the original four radial perturbation functions are reduced to three by the identification @xmath28 .",
    "+ of the six independent linear differential equations so obtained ( the diagonal @xmath16 and @xmath29 terms being equal ) , four turn out to be of the first order , unlike the schwarzschild - specialized system which instead has three first order equations , and a completely algebraic variable - elimination procedure allows the derivation of a first integral condition which is the generalization of @xcite-(eq .",
    "10 ) . as in zerilli s procedure @xcite , more elaborate but always tied to a polynomial coefficient identification principle , this algebraic condition plus three of the previous equations can be treated , with a double function substitution and the change of the radial coordinate , to form a new system of seven differential equations in four variables ( plus the derivative of the new radial coordinate with respect to @xmath30 ) , this time non - linear but independent of @xmath12 , to which the formal definition of the effective potential must be added .",
    "three of these unknown functions are then found , after a cascade of algebraic eliminations ( which do nt show the residual arbitrariness found by zerilli in the schwarzschild treatment ) , to be quite simply dependent on the fourth , which satisfies a final second - order very complex equation , fortunately analytically solvable when specialized to the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm metrics .",
    "a comprehensive table of functions and variables in the three cases  general static spherically - symmetric form ( g ) , schwarzschild ( s ) and reissner - nordstrm ( rn) can be sketched , the latter two obtained , respectively , by the two substitutions \\{@xmath31 } and \\{@xmath32 } : +        * schwarzschild : @xmath33 * reissner - nordstrm : @xmath34 ^ 2\\;r^4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35\\;r^4\\\\ & + 12m\\;[6m^2-(19\\lambda-3)q^2]\\;r^3 - 3q^2\\;[108m^2-(38\\lambda-3)q^2]\\;r^2\\\\ & + 342mq^4r-117q^6 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    as a final remark , it is straightforward to verify that the two different kinds of tortoise coordinates in the general case reduce to one for all metrics having @xmath36 and that as expected , @xmath37 holds for both the magnetic and the electric parities .",
