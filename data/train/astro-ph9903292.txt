    "there have been numerous analyses of substructure in clusters of galaxies over the past decade ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) , partly motivated by the expectation that its study will help unravel the cosmogony underlying their formation .",
    "for example , the presence of substructure can teach us about the overall matter density in the universe ( @xcite ) , although subject to the uncertainty in the rate at which substructure is erased ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another example is the spatial distribution of substructure , which can give clues to the formation process ( @xcite ) .",
    "most studies of substructure have been statistical in nature , with both optical and x - ray studies suggesting that @xmath1 of clusters show evidence of substructure in their galaxy and/or gas distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . a sharper agreement on what fraction of clusters shows substructure in its projected distribution",
    "is precluded partly because many features are generically considered as substructure ( see a discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition the fraction appears to be much larger ( @xmath2 , @xcite ) when evidence for substructure is also looked for in the form of multimodal velocity distributions .",
    "this kind of test is more sensitive to substructure arising from line - of - sight mergers in clusters ( @xcite ) , which can then appear fairly smooth in their projected distribution .",
    "in fact , one is tempted to ask if the remaining @xmath3 might not be clusters where a line - of - sight merger has comparable - mass subclumps that have substantially decelerated after the cores collided",
    ". these would be difficult to uncover in the projected distribution of galaxies in the cluster due to orientation , and in the velocity distribution because the subclumps have nearly stopped .",
    "our analysis of a3266 here suggests that it is an example of such clusters .",
    "studies have also been directed at individual clusters , such as the coma cluster ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "other examples include a400 ( @xcite ) , a2634 ( @xcite ) , and a recent study of the a3558 cluster complex ( @xcite ) . in these studies",
    "one attempts to go beyond simply establishing that there is evidence of substructure and into modeling the possible dynamics that gives rise to the observed structure .",
    "the study of substructure in individual clusters can be helpful to check trends expected in cosmological models .",
    "for example , it appears that an absence of cooling flows occurs in clusters undergoing a merger ( see @xcite , and references therein ) , as expected from hydro / n - body simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , these studies can help unravel whether the substructure is the result of a major merger or an aggregate of accreeted small units .",
    "this question has also been addressed statistically by gonzlez - casado , salvador - sol , serna & alimi ( 1998 ) .",
    "here we present an analysis of spectroscopic data for galaxies in the aco galaxy cluster a3266 , obtained by qrw , which we interpret by means of simple n - body simulations to infer the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "we briefly summarize the observations of qrw in the next section , together with further analysis of the data .",
    "we then present simple , 1000-particle n - body simulations of the cluster .",
    "we find that simple statistical tests give mixed signals about the presence of substructure in the simulated cluster , much like we find for the real cluster in section 2 , and despite the fact that there is an ongoing merger in the n - body cluster .",
    "finally , we close with a section of discussion of this analysis and the conclusions we draw from it .",
    "qrw compiled a total of 387 velocities in an area approximately @xmath4 centered on a3266 , most of which ( 229 ) were new velocities obtained from runs at the cerro tololo ( ctio ) and las campanas ( lco ) observatories .",
    "a total of 317 galaxies were identified as cluster members from the distribution of velocities , making it one of the largest data sets of its kind for clusters in the aco catalog .",
    "the first run was carried out using the argus spectrograph at the ctio 4 m telescope during the early parts of two nights on 1990 february 17 - 19 .",
    "three argus fields were observed in a3266 during this run , securing new spectra for 46 objects .",
    "three 900 s exposures for the first field were taken on the second night of the run .",
    "two 1800 s exposures for the second field and two 1500 s for the third field were taken on the final night .",
    "given the measured stability of the instrument , a single long exposure of the he - ar comparison lamp was taken every night to calibrate all exposures in wavelength . to compare and check on possible zero - point shifts , several velocities of standard stars and some galaxies with well - known velocities",
    "were measured using one of the fibers .",
    "exposures of a white spot in the dome and sky flats were used to correct for pixel - to - pixel , large scale , and illumination variations in the detector ( the @xmath5 pixels ti#2 ccd ) response . finally , the grating used was klgl2 , tilted to provide a wavelength coverage from @xmath6  .",
    "the preflashed ccd exposures were binned @xmath7 in the fibers - slit direction , giving a dispersion of 2.2  / pixel with a fwhm resolution of @xmath8  .",
    "the whole @xmath4 field around a3266 was explored in the second run , using shectman s fiber spectrograph mounted on the 2.5 m dupont telescope at lco .",
    "the run was carried out on the nights of 1990 october 22 - 25 , and a total of 263 new spectra were obtained .",
    "five fields were used to cover ( with considerable overlap ) an area of approximately @xmath4 , with exposure times adjusted between 80 and 120 min depending on the brightness of the selected galaxies in each of the exposures .",
    "standard quartz lamp exposures of the dome were used to approximately correct for pixel - to - pixel variations of the 2d - frutti detector coupled to the spectrograph , but no corrections were made for the ( small ) dark current in the detector .",
    "he - ne comparison lamp exposures were taken for wavelength calibration before and after each exposure . with a 600 line / mm grating plus the 2d - frutti detector , spectra covered the range @xmath9  with a dispersion of @xmath10  / pixel , and a resolution of @xmath11  .",
    "a careful analysis was carried out by qrw in order to combine the measurements from the two runs with previous data ( mostly from @xcite and @xcite ) and create the homogeneous , large catalog of velocities we use here .",
    "we first consider the velocity distribution for the 317 members identified in a3266 .",
    "we find that even with this large number of velocities there is no conclusive evidence of non - normality in the velocity distribution , which would be indicative of the presence of substructure .",
    "for example , the skewness and kurtosis are .105 and 3.32 respectively . for a gaussian distribution",
    ", values as high as these would occur 21.7% and 9.64% of cases respectively ( the mean and dispersion are estimated from the data ) .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic , however , appears to exclude the gaussian hypothesis at a much higher confidence level ( cl ) of 95% ( see qrw ) .",
    "this is rather surprising , since one would expect order statistic tests to be less sensitive ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ks test was not considered in @xcite , but it is easy to carry out the analysis for it . in table 1",
    "we present the fraction of times the ks , skewness and kurtosis tests would reject a tukey distribution ( see @xcite , and references therein ) as non - gaussian at the 95% cl .",
    "it can be seen there that the ks test never outperforms a combined skewness - and- kurtosis test .",
    "in fact , skewness and kurtosis alone were used in the recent analysis of the enacs clusters ( @xcite ) , where a3266 would not have been considered as having a non - gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "lcccccc ks & 0.23 & 0.73 & 0.53 & 0.98 & 0.68 & 0.99skewness & 0.67 & 0.99 & 0.24 & 0.37 & 0.70 & 0.90kurtosis & 0.18 & 0.52 & 0.95 & 1.00 & 0.96 & 1.00    the 5% of samples with the highest values of the ks statistic , and drawn from a gaussian distribution , are biased to high skewness and kurtosis .",
    "values such as those above would occur a fraction of 40.5% and 18.7% of the time ( respectively ) in that subset of samples .",
    "therefore , the qrw sample might just be an `` unlucky '' sample out of a gausian distribution .",
    "after all , 5% is not such a low probability if we bear in mind that confidence levels refer to any set of measurements , not just measurements in a3266 .",
    "moreover , we find that if we assume _ true _ mean and dispersion of @xmath12 km / sec and @xmath13 km / sec respectively , which are values well within the measurement errors , all three tests give rather large probabilities ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively for the ks , skewness and kurtosis tests ) that the set is drawn from a gaussian parent .",
    "thus , we conclude that the gaussian hypothesis can not be excluded with sufficient confidence .    the distribution of the member galaxies in the plane of the sky can be combined with the velocity information in order to further search for departures from equilibrium .",
    "we find that the central region of a3266 is entirely consistent with a spherical isothermal distribution .",
    "the cumulative distribution of right ascensions ( ra ) or declinations ( dec ) needed to perform a ks test can be readily worked out for an isothermal distribution .",
    "we find that the distribution of ra , @xmath16 , inside a box of size @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) in ra ( dec ) centered on the cluster must be @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "( we have assumed that the galaxies trace the mass and the cluster core radius is very small , as indicated by gravitational lensing studies of rich clusters .",
    "see e.g. @xcite ) . since the galaxies trace the mass , we take the cluster center to be the center of a smoothed galaxy density map , shown in fig",
    "a typical monte carlo ( mc ) realization of the data in a window of the same size as in fig .",
    "1(a ) , using eq.(1 ) , is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in the central @xmath22 ,",
    "the ks statistic is at the 74% ( 40% ) cl for the distribution of ra ( dec ) positions .",
    "the test against a gaussian distribution for the velocities in the same window gives a 24% cl .",
    "( the skewness ( kurtosis ) of the velocity distribution , -0.016 ( 2.8 ) , is at the 47% ( 42% ) cl ) .",
    "as well , the test of dressler & shectman ( 1988 ; ds ) , which combines the velocity and position information , is also consistent with a relaxed distribution .",
    "inside the same window we get @xmath23 km / s , where @xmath24 @xmath25 is the average velocity ( dispersion ) among galaxy i and its ten nearest neighbors , and @xmath26 is the average velocity ( dispersion ) among all @xmath27 galaxies in the window .",
    "the significance of this is obtained by comparing @xmath28 to the values obtained from 1000 mc reshufflings of the velocities , which put @xmath28 at the 19% cl .",
    "all these numbers are entirely consistent with a relaxed , isothermal core in a3266 .",
    "these findings are not necessarily in disagreement with those of mohr , fabricant , & geller ( 1993 ) since the substructure they claim inside this window in a3266 ( inferred from a systematic shift in x - ray isophote centroids ) refers to the _ gas _ distribution .",
    "for example , the gas in a cluster can remain perturbed much longer than the matter distribution in the case of a merger ( see @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) .    including galaxy positions outside of this core , on the other hand , we find an increasingly significant deviation from the isothermal distribution , especially in dec . the ks test on positions inside a window @xmath29 yields a cl of 99.96% ( 91.1% ) for dec ( ra ) . for the entire @xmath4 field",
    ", we find cl s of 99.9999% and 99.8% for dec and ra respectively .",
    "the ds test gives a @xmath28 for the entire field @xmath30 above the mean of the mc sets , a highly significant deviation .",
    "thus , the choice of a large field and the measurement of a large number of velocities is crucial in uncovering this large - scale ` anomaly ' in a3266 .",
    "relaxed dark matter halos are known not to be spherically symmetric , but are well described by triaxial spheroids ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the deviation from our test fit does not immediately imply the presence of substructure .",
    "however , it can readily be seen that the deviation detected by the ra and dec ks tests is not due to flattening . in fig .",
    "2 we show the cumulative distribution of positions as a function of position along the ra and dec axes .",
    "it can be seen there that the distribution of declinations is highly asymmetric , indicating a clear excess of particles on the north side of a3266 .",
    "the distribution of ra s is more symmetric , indicating somewhat of an excess on the east side of a3266 .",
    "this excess of galaxies to the n - ne of the cluster can be easily understood in terms of the ` wedge ' structure suggested by qrw in a redshift slice through the cluster ( see e.g fig . 19 in qrw , and fig .",
    "4(b ) below ) . indeed , we find that removing that slice from the data makes the dec distribution much more symmetric . however , the possibility that the angular position of galaxies in the slices in front and behind the cluster ( fig .",
    "15 vs fig . 16 in qrw )",
    "are drawn from the same distribution is excluded only at the 86% cl by a ks test .    by contrast",
    ", the ds test suggests a ` clumpy ' type of substructure . in fig .",
    "3(a ) we show the distribution of @xmath31 s . given the clear excess of galaxies with @xmath32 km / s , in fig .",
    "3(b ) we show the spatial distribution of all such galaxies .",
    "several clumps can be seen there , but no ` wedge ' of galaxies . also , despite appearances ,",
    "most of the @xmath30 signal is confined to the periphery near and outside the virial radius ( marked by the dotted circle ) .",
    "the cl of @xmath28 reaches 90% outside 90% of the virial radius , and reaches 96% at the virial radius .",
    "thus , the signal here appears entirely consistent with expectations for a relaxed cluster in a bottom - up hierarchical formation of structure , where subclumps continue to accrete onto a relaxed core formed early on .",
    "qrw suggested the ` wedge ' could be interpreted as a plume of galaxies resulting from the recent merger of two subunits , with one subunit having passed through the center from the sw front of the cluster and given rise to a plume of outflying galaxies .",
    "here we present further evidence in favor of this hypothesis , and in the next section show that such a feature in the data ( and other characteristics of the data ) can indeed be understood as a result of a recent merger that we simulate by means of a simple n - body simulation .",
    "the tidal fields resulting from a merger could be expected to significantly affect the star formation rate in disk galaxies given the strong distortions induced in such galaxies when passing through cluster cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore emission line galaxies ( elg ) can serve as tracers of such an environment .",
    "many galaxies in the qrw data are elg , therefore we have tested if such galaxies indeed trace the plume seen in the redshift slice of qrw .",
    "this would make it plausible that indeed there is a physical association among those galaxies . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the position of elg ( a ) below and ( b ) above the mean velocity . indeed , there is a striking difference in their distribution .",
    "the distribution seen in fig .",
    "4(b ) suggests once again that a subclump of galaxies has shot past from the lower front to the upper back of the cluster . the possibility that the angular positions of the elg in front and behind the cluster trace the same distribution",
    "is excluded at the 98.8% cl by a ks test .",
    "we believe that these results put on much firmer ground the hypothesis that the galaxies in the plume are physically associated .",
    "we have performed simple n - body simulations of 1000 particles in order to investigate the feasibility of the merger scenario proposed by qrw .",
    "the particles start in hubble expansion within an isolated , uniform density sphere representing the pre - collapse phase of a cluster .",
    "a small amount of angular momentum is added to represent the angular momentum that would result from the tidal torquing by nearby condensations .",
    "of course , the collapse and formation of a cluster is far more complex than what we represent here .",
    "our aim is simply to explore if a merger giving rise to something like the plume seen in the data ( and with characteristics that would perform similarly under statistical tests ) would happen in this simple , top - hat approximation to the real collapse of a dark matter halo .",
    "we use the n - body code described in blumenthal , faber , flores , & primack ( 1986 ) , and carry out dissipationless simulations that represent the evolution of the dark matter .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the evolution of a simulation that we analyze in this section . in this simulation",
    "there is a major merger at the center because the poisson noise introduced by the discrete realization of the top - hat initial condition has made the center slightly underdense , therefore the center gets evacuated ( a void forms ) and eventually the matter falls in and the merger occurs .",
    "5(a ) shows ( clockwise ) the evolution of all the particles , from the time the system is near maximum expansion until the time it resembles the situation in a3266 . at this time",
    "the velocity distribution of the system closely resembles that of a3266 , and it is the only time at which it does so . in fig .",
    "5(b ) we show the evolution of the densest groups we can identify prior to the major meger .",
    "the first ( top left ) panel shows the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "5(a ) with the group members identified , and follows the evolution ( clockwise ) of those groups alone until the time of the bottom left panel in fig .",
    "the groups have mass ratios of 1:2.2:5.5 . in the last panel",
    "the solid - dot group is moving away and has developed into a wedge - shape plume that bears a striking resemblance to the plume uncovered by qrw .    in the top panels of fig .",
    "6 we show the distribution of the particles in velocity slices of the same relative thickness as the 1500 km / s slices in qrw , both immediately below ( left ) and above ( right ) the velocity average .",
    "it can be seen that the plume is still clearly visible in the panel on the right .",
    "the bottom panels show a random sampling of the n - body data , of the size of the a3266 sample , that is more directly comparable to the a3266 data ( assuming the galaxies closely trace the dark matter distribution ) .",
    "the plume can still be discerned there , and a ks test on the angular distributions rejects their compatibility at a very high confidence level .    the velocity distribution of the particles in the simulation is shown in fig .",
    "7 ( top panel ) together with the same distribution for a3266 .",
    "they look remarkably similar , but the difference in peak heights of the dark matter distribution is not a sampling artifact and suggests that the structure seen in a3266 might be due to a merger of like - mass subclusters rather than the heavy - light merger seen in the simulation .",
    "a random sample from the n - body data , of the same size as the a3266 sample , is shown in the bottom panel . in this case",
    "the ks test on the n - body distribution excludes the gaussian hypothesis at a higher ( 99% ) cl than that for a3266 .",
    "the skewness ( -0.30 ) excludes the gaussian hypothesis at the 99% cl ( the kurtosis , 2.97 , is ok ) . for most samplings of the n - body data , however , only the skewness test rejects the gaussian hypothesis with high significance",
    ". obviously , the skewness test picks up the intrinsic asymmetry due to the unequal mass nature of the n - body merger .",
    "thus , for an equal mass merger the results would resemble more closely those for a3266 .    finally , the ds test on 317-particle samples gives @xmath28 s @xmath33 above the mean of the mc sets . as in the case of a3266",
    ", the spatial distribution of the particles with high @xmath31 s does not trace the plume seen in the redshift slice above the n - body cluster s mean velocity .",
    "this is shown in fig . 8 for two typical samples . also , the inner core ( half the size the window shown in fig .",
    "8) is entirely consistent with a relaxed distribution .",
    "the simulations and the analysis of the data that we have carried out in the preceeding sections clearly show that the data of qrw on a3266 can be well explained as the result of a relatively recent , major merger at the core of a3266 .",
    "if we fit the x - axis velocity dispersion and the virial mass of the simulation to the values for a3266 , @xmath34 km / s and @xmath35 respectively , then we find that the time ellapsed since the cores of the two massive subclumps roughly coincided is @xmath36 years .",
    "we also find that in this case the true mass has been overestimated by about 70% .",
    "this large a factor is to be expected in this kind of situation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are many questions that our analysis is not able to address .",
    "foremost among them is the relation of the merger we claim here , and the merger claimed by mohr , fabricant , & geller ( 1993 ) .",
    "their claim for evidence of a merger was based on their evidence that the cluster is not relaxed and evidence by teague , carter , & gray ( 1990 ) of an e - w alignment preference for galaxies at the extremes of the velocity distribution .",
    "however , qrw ( as well others ; see qrw ) have noticed many discrepancies in velocities deemed uncertain by teague , carter , & gray ( 1990 ) , and it can be seen in fig .",
    "18 and 20 of qrw that there is no e - w enhancement of such galaxies .",
    "furthermore , mohr , fabricant , & geller ( 1993 ) point out the agreement in morphology ( elongated ) and orientation of the smoothed x - ray intensity and galaxy density contours , as well as the presence of a secondary peak in the galaxy density map , as further evidence for substructure in a3266 .",
    "however , we estimate that the galaxy map results could be the result of sparse sampling of an otherwise smooth , isothermal distribution in about 20% of cases .",
    "we show an example in fig .",
    "naturally , a hydrodynamical simulation of a major merger like the one we have advocated here could better test if the x - ray and optical data are all consistent with such a merger .",
    "another issue that we have not been able to address is that of the dumb - bell system in a3266 , most likely itself the result of the merger we have discussed here .",
    "our simulations do not have nearly the level of resolution that would be needed to explore if the dumb - bell parameters ( separation , relative velocity , and orientation in the sky ) could be explained by the merger hypothesis .",
    "simulations in the style of those discussed by dubinski ( 1999 ) would be able to address these question .",
    "here we just note that it is perhaps significant that the dumb - bell is not centered on the density map , fig .",
    "1(a ) , exactly what would be expected if the system had been formed in a recent meger .",
    "there are many examples of cd galaxies that do not sit at the bottom of cluster potential wells , precisely in clusters that show evidence of a recent merger ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is much observational follow up work that can be suggested to further test our merger hypothesis .",
    "first , the nature of the merger in a3266 that we advocate here , nearly along the line of sight , makes the core of a3266 an ideal target for a search of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the redshift of a3266 is low , but there are examples of weak lensing at this low a redshift ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the cluster is very massive , and the elongated mass distribution resulting from the merger will further enhance the weak lensing relative to a spherical cluster with the same velocity dispersion .",
    "we plan to carry out such observations in the near future .",
    "second , a detailed morphological study of the galaxies in a3266 could help further verify the reality of the merger we have advocated here .",
    "for example , spirals and elliptical might have characteristically different spatial distributions as a result of type segregation in the pre - merger subclusters and due to the different effect of tidal fields in the inner and outer parts of the merging subclusters .",
    "we also plan to carry out such a study in the near future .",
    "we have carefully analyzed the optical data available on a3266 , and interpreted it with the help of simple n - body simulations to conclude that there is good evidence in the data that a major merger of comparable - mass components has occurred relatively recently in this cluster .",
    "this analysis has required a wide - area coverage in the cluster , as well as a large number of galaxy spectra in order to uncover the large - scale plume of galaxies that we have advocated here to be a telltale sign of a recent , major merger .",
    "this opens the prospect that under similar scrutiny other , perhaps many ? ( of the 20% we have mentioned ) , apparently relaxed clusters might be discovered to actually be undergoing a major merger .",
    "the frequency with which such process is seen to occur in nearby clusters might then tell us about the underlying cosmogony generating them .",
