    "two non - orthogonal quantum states can not be discriminated with certainty , while the discrimination error can be made smaller as their copies are provided .",
    "this leads to one of the well - known no - go theorems , that quantum states can not be copied with certainty @xcite , although approximate quantum cloning is possible with the use of quantum operations and ancillary quantum systems @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the impossibility of perfect quantum cloning can be connected to the no - signalling principle in physics , which dictates that information can not be sent faster than light . as a consequence , quantum communication that makes use of ( non - local ) quantum correlations",
    "can not be performed faster than light .",
    "in fact , the relation between the no - cloning theorem and the no - signalling constraint has been established in both qualitative and quantitative terms .",
    "for instance , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that any no - signalling theory predicting non - locality , i.e. violation of bell inequalities , has a no - cloning theorem .",
    "this implies that quantum theory necessarily has the no - cloning theorem .",
    "in addition , the optimal fidelity of approximate quantum cloning has been derived by applying the no - signalling condition to the cloning process of quantum states @xcite , provided that corresponding quantum operations are positive @xcite .    on the other hand , the impossibility of perfect state discrimination can also be connected to the no - signalling condition in a qualitative way , at least through the existing relation that the no - cloning theorem is implied by the no - signalling constraint .",
    "now the question naturally arises whether there is a quantitative connection as well .",
    "in fact , recent progress along this line has shown that the no - signalling condition would imply the optimality of state discrimination , constrained to those figures of merit such as minimum - error discrimination @xcite , unambiguous state discrimination @xcite , and maximum confidence measurement @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the optimality of state discrimination in different figures of merit can be derived from the single condition , no - signalling constraint , despite the fact that quantum theory is not a maximally non - local theory @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we relate the no - signalling condition to minimum - error state discrimination of ensembles of quantum states i.e. mixed states .",
    "the novelty of this work is that two quantum states to be discriminated between are not purely quantum but mixtures of pure quantum states .",
    "we shall derive the minimum error for discriminating between two ensembles of quantum states from the no - signalling constraint . the proof is built on a communication scenario between two parties , alice and bob .",
    "before starting the main proof , for clarity we first fix notations to be used in the communication scenario and then briefly review some known facts about quantum states , minimum - error discrimination and ensemble decompositions .",
    "we also restrict our consideration to qubit states , so one can make use of the representation in which a single qubit state is fully characterised by its bloch vector @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "pure states have unit bloch vectors @xmath3 .",
    "the communication scenario to be considered assumes that , sharing entangled states with bob , alice measures her qubits to prepare the ensemble decomposition of bob s state , either one of two ensembles , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as follows , _",
    "b^(0 ) & = & p_0 + ( 1-p)|| , + _",
    "b^(1 ) & = & p_1 + ( 1-p)|--| , [ bobs ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two qubit states for which we are to derive the discrimination bound using the no - signalling constraint , and @xmath8 are two orthogonal quantum states such that it holds @xmath9 , see fig [ fig ] .",
    "it is convenient to express those quantum states in ( [ bobs ] ) in terms of bloch vectors as follows , _",
    "b^(i ) = _ b^(i ) ( _ b^(i ) ) ,   _ i = _ i ( _ i ) ,   || = ( _ ) , [ parameter ] where @xmath10 .",
    "then , the relation between quantum states in ( [ bobs ] ) can be translated to the following relations between bloch vectors _",
    "b^(0 ) & = & p _ 0 + ( 1-p ) _ , + _",
    "b^(1 ) & = & p _ 1 + ( 1-p ) _ - . [ vec ]",
    "recall that @xmath11 and @xmath12 in ( [ bobs ] ) are two quantum states that we wish to discriminate between .",
    "the minimum - error discrimination between two quantum states has been completely analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite optimizing over all possible measurement bases .",
    "the minimum error , known as the helstrom bound , is p_e= - _ 0 - _",
    "1,[hel ] assuming that the _ a priori _ probability that the quantum state @xmath13 occurs is equally @xmath14 . here",
    "the trace norm for an operator @xmath15 , denoted by @xmath16 , is defined as @xmath17 $ ] . as is shown in ( [ hel ] ) ,",
    "the optimal discrimination between two quantum states only depends on their ( trace - norm ) distance separation , and in particular it does not depend on the dimensions of the states .    , and",
    "here we restrict to two decompositions that can be seen in a cross - section of the bloch sphere spanned by @xmath18 and @xmath19 or @xmath20 . as is shown in ( [ vec ] )",
    ", @xmath21 can be a mixture of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , or @xmath24 and @xmath25 , both of which point to the same point in the bloch sphere , meaning that they have the same ensemble average.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]    we now review properties of _ ensembles _ of quantum states , known as mixed states .",
    "these are classical mixtures of some pure quantum states .",
    "for instance , each mixed state @xmath26 ( for @xmath10 ) in ( [ parameter ] ) can be expressed as a convex combination of some other pure states @xmath27 , i.e. _ i = _ j _ j |v_j^i v_j^i| .",
    "[ pure ] note that such a decomposition is not unique @xcite .",
    "this means that , in reality , once an ensemble of quantum states is given , its actual decomposition can not be known without knowing how the state was prepared .",
    "one can only deduce ensemble - averaged properties of the state , which does not depend on any particular decomposition .    now let us assume that two quantum states in ( [ bobs ] ) are the same . using the expression in ( [ vec ] ) , one can see that the vector of each ensemble of quantum states points to the same point in the bloch sphere , see fig .",
    "that is , the two quantum states have different decompositions but have the same ensemble average .",
    "in addition , each @xmath13 , @xmath28 , is again a mixture of pure quantum states , so finally quantum states of bob in @xmath29 can be expressed as an ensemble of pure quantum states .",
    "recall that for any mixed state , there exists higher - dimensional pure quantum state such that partial reduction of the pure state would be the mixed state itself . in this case ,",
    "two - dimensional ancillary systems suffice to purify those quantum states in ( [ bobs ] ) . for two different decompositions of the same state in ( [ bobs ] ) ,",
    "the corresponding purifications are equivalent up to local unitary transformations .",
    "this simply depends on choice of the measurement basis on the ancillary systems .",
    "if we assume that alice holds the purification , her measurement will decide the decomposition of bob s quantum state .",
    "however , unless alice announces what basis her measurement was made in , bob will never know which decomposition he has .",
    "performing quantum state tomography will only allow bob to understand his quantum state as an ensemble average of other quantum states .",
    "this is in fact what prevents the two parties communicating faster than light .",
    "we are ready to prove that the no - signalling constraint implies that the helstrom bound in ( [ hel ] ) is optimal .",
    "consider that alice and bob are separated in space so that local actions performed by one can not affect the other .",
    "suppose that they share copies of entangled states of @xmath30 |_ab = _",
    "j|a_j_a |b_j_b,[ab ] which is not written in orthonormal basis of alice and bob , so @xmath31 may exceed the rank of systems belonging to two parties . as we have mentioned above , alice chooses measurement basis so that after the measurement on her particle , the ensemble decomposition of bob s state is determined",
    ". in other words , alice performs a measurement @xmath32 or @xmath33(which are general positive - operator - valued - measures ) , after which decomposition of bob s state will be either @xmath4 or @xmath5 in ( [ bobs ] ) respectively .",
    "alice actually can make use of the measurement @xmath32 and @xmath33 as an encoding such that a value @xmath31 is encoded by applying @xmath34 .",
    "bob then decodes the value by discriminating between two ensembles @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "two ensembles are the same , i.e. _",
    "b^(0 ) = _ b^(1 ) and so their bloch vectors are also the same , i.e. @xmath35 from ( [ vec ] ) , and therefore the value @xmath36 in ( [ vec ] ) is uniquely determined , p=. [ p ]    let us now consider a detector that bob applies , that works as follows .",
    "once a qubit in a state @xmath37 being measured , the detector gives an outcome @xmath38 with some probability @xmath39 where @xmath10 , i.e. the detector can be thought of being in a black box from which we only know the input / output list .",
    "therefore , it fulfills that @xmath40 note that we do not know all the properties of the detector , e.g. the internal structure , etc . , but the probabilities @xmath39 for @xmath10 . for two states @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", we can assume that in general @xmath41 , by which it also follows that @xmath42 .",
    "while alice not announcing which measurement is applied , bob can make guess of it by designing his detector to discriminate the two states @xmath43 of @xmath4 and @xmath44 of @xmath5 .",
    "if the detector discriminates between @xmath6 and @xmath7 and gives an output @xmath38 ( either @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) , bob will then conclude that the ensemble is @xmath47 .",
    "note that alice applies measurement @xmath48 or @xmath49 with equal probabilities , and then the error rate is @xmath50/2.\\ ] ]    two ensembles in ( [ bobs ] ) consist of not only @xmath26 but also @xmath51 .",
    "although the detector being designed to discriminate between the two states @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the ensemble , the detector produces some outcomes for @xmath52 and @xmath53 with some probabilities @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "assume first that alice applies the measurement @xmath32 so that @xmath56 is prepared on the bob s side .",
    "bob is then with the state @xmath43 with probability @xmath36 , from which the value @xmath45 is found with probability @xmath57 .",
    "bob is also with the state @xmath53 with probability @xmath58 , from which he can guess the value @xmath45 with probability @xmath59 , a non - negative number .",
    "finally , the overall probability that detector s output says the value @xmath45 when alice prepares the ensemble @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath60 denote the probability that the detector says @xmath38 when alice prepares @xmath61 for @xmath10 and @xmath28 . ] and @xmath62 , is greater than or equal to @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 we also have @xmath65 , the overall probability that detector s output says the value @xmath46 when the same ensemble @xmath4 is prepared .",
    "clearly it holds that @xmath66 next , assume that alice applies the measurement @xmath33 so that @xmath5 is prepared . in the same way we have done for the ensemble @xmath4 , the overall probability that the detector says the value @xmath46 , denoted by @xmath67 , is greater than or equal to @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 it holds again that @xmath70 however , if the following holds @xmath71 bob can discriminate the two ensembles since equations in ( [ b ] ) , ( [ d ] ) , and ( [ e ] ) tell that @xmath72 the above ( [ f ] ) means that , once @xmath34 is applied so that @xmath61 is prepared , the measurement data show more frequency on the value @xmath31 than @xmath73 , through which the two ensemble can be discriminated .",
    "this implies that the no - signalling principle excludes ( [ e ] ) and therefore the following holds , @xmath74 combining ( [ a ] ) , ( [ c ] ) , and ( [ g ] ) , we have @xmath75 as well , from ( [ y]),([z ] ) , and ( [ h ] ) we obtain @xmath76 finally from ( [ p ] ) and ( [ i ] ) , the following is the discrimination error limited by the non - signalling principle @xmath77 which is already saturated by the helstrom bound in ( [ hel ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we relate two no - go theorems - the no - perfect state discrimination and the no - signalling - by showing that the optimal discrimination between two quantum states is derived from the no - signalling condition .",
    "it can thus be said that the impossibility of perfect state discrimination is a consequence of the no - signalling condition , not only qualitatively , but also quantitatively as is the case with the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the fidelity of optimal quantum cloning converges asymptotically to the fidelity obtained through optimal state estimation .",
    "therefore , the quantitative relationship between three no - go theorems- no - signalling , no - cloning , and no - perfect state estimation- has been established at the most basic level i.e. two non - orthogonal quantum states",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate whether optimal values of all figures of merit in state discrimination , more generally state estimation , of quantum states could be derived solely from the no - signalling condition .",
    "recently , it is shown that the optimal measurement for the maximum confidence is also implied by the no - signalling condition @xcite .",
