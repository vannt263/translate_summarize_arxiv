    "the experimental system is fairly well synchronized even at the smallest nonzero coupling , while the model synchronizes more gradually .",
    "the model also exhibits more fluctuations in synchrony , as exemplified by the larger standard deviations . for both model and experiment , the amplitude synchronization ( cross - correlation )",
    "is typically larger than the phase synchronization .",

    "the latter portions of figure [ fig : sync_vs_t ] are enlarged in figure [ fig : sync_vs_t_zoom ] .",
    "we develop an algorithm to compute the leader and follower .    for each round - trip",
    ", we compute the synchronization with either laser leading .",
    "let @xmath66 be the difference between the correlations for each round - trip @xmath67 within a run , and let @xmath68 be the standard deviation of the @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath70 for some cutoff factor @xmath71 , we say that the synchronization is substantially greater with one laser leading than with the other , and a clear leader and follower can be identified .",
    "leader and follower for phase synchronization are defined similarly .",

    "we select @xmath72 to use as the cutoff factor in this study . for most values of @xmath31 , for both the model and experimental data",
    ", the choice @xmath72 leads to approximately 30% of round - trips having an identified leader and follower for amplitude and phase synchronization .",

    "let @xmath73 be the set of round - trip numbers @xmath74 for which @xmath75 . whenever the sign of @xmath76 is opposite the sign of @xmath77 , a switch is identified at round - trip @xmath74 .    to obtain statistics over several runs ,",
    "let @xmath78 be the total number of round - trips and @xmath79 total number of switches in amplitude synchronization observed .",
    "then the average number of round - trips between switches is @xmath80 .",
    "we assume square root error in the number of observed switches , leading to an error of @xmath81 in the number of round - trips between switches .",
    "switches in phase synchronization are located by the same procedure .",
    "an example of switching is given in figure [ fig : sync_vs_t ] and figure [ fig : sync_vs_t_zoom ] : locations of switches identified by our algorithm are marked by arrows .",
    "note that switches are defined only when the leader and follower change ; for example , no switch is identified around round - trip 2000 when @xmath57 and @xmath58 come together with no defined leader and then separate with the same leader and follower as before .",
    "switches were studied in the model and experiment for a range of coupling strengths , using the same data sets as in section [ sec : synchronization ] .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig : switches ] .",
    "we find that the time between switches in phase synchronization decreases as the coupling increases for both the experiment and model .",
    "results for the amplitude synchronization are less clear . for the model ,",
    "switching in amplitude synchronization follows the same trend as for phase synchronization .",
    "however , the experimental system exhibits fewer switches in amplitude synchronization at larger coupling strengths .",
    "we compared experimental measurements with model predictions for a pair of mutually coupled fiber ring lasers as the coupling strength was varied .",
    "the coupling has similar effect on the dynamics in both model and experiment .",
    "quantitative measures of amplitude and phase synchronization were made , the latter by using the hilbert phase .",
    "approximately equal synchronization was found for forward and reverse time shifts equal to the coupling delay .",
    "we notice that the lasers spend considerable periods of time in synchronized states with no discernable leader or follower , since the synchronization values are very similar for time shifts in either direction .",
    "this is in contrast to the mutually coupled system with delay but no optical feedback described in @xcite , where leader and follower could be identified when the cross - correlation was computed for a short time series .",
    "we defined an algorithm to locate subtle switches of leader / follower between the two lasers .",
    "our statistical measures allow a leader and follower to be identified when the synchronization is sufficiently larger in one direction of the time shift .    although the trend of increasing synchronization with increasing coupling was consistent between model and experiment , the shape of the synchronization vs.  coupling curves differed , with the experimental system synchronizing more quickly .",
    "in addition , the fluctuations in synchronization were generally larger in the model .",
    "the model we have used includes only one polarization mode in each laser .",
    "future extensions to the model should include both polarization modes .",
    "this may explain the discrepancy between the experimental observations and computational prediction in the shapes of figure [ fig : sync_vs_kappa ] .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors note that for long time series , forward and reverse time shifts yielded similar cross - correlations , although leader and follower could be identified from cross - correlations of short time series .",
    "our cross - correlations were computed over the natural time scale of a round - trip , and similar results are obtained for shorter time series with length equal to the delay time ( data not shown ) .",
    "our observation that the system often does not have a clear leader and follower seems robust for reasonable choices of window size for averaging , although further study of appropriate window size may be conducted .",
    "the method for choosing the cutoff to identify clear regions of leader and follower is based on an internal definition for a given time series .",
    "the choice of the cutoff factor @xmath71 to be one standard deviation is somewhat arbitrary , but preliminary results indicate that the trends of the switching frequency vs.  coupling are preserved for different cutoff factors .",
    "the algorithm for identifying switches may in the future be applied to other systems in which the difference in synchronization for forward and reverse time shifts is more substantial .",
    "we typically observe a higher frequency of switching at higher coupling values .",
    "there are very similar trends in the frequency of switches of leader / follower for the phase synchronization in experiment and theory .",
    "this effect might be expected since the lasers mutually influence each other more effectively with stronger coupling and thus can respond to each other more quickly .",
    "however , we can not explain the differences in corresponding plots for the amplitude synchronization .",
    "further study of this phenomenon is needed .    in this study , we considered variations in the coupling strengths only .",
    "the noise strength for the numerical computations was chosen somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "the main guiding principle was to have a reasonable correspondence between the uncoupled lasers in theory and experiment .",
    "future studies will consider changes in the noise strength .",
    "another parameter to be varied is the detuning between lasers , because its value is not known exactly for the experimental system .",
    "the inclusion of a second polarization mode will introduce another set of parameters whose variation may also be studied .",
