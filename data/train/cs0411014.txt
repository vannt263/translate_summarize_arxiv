    "the original data is called the ` source word ' and the encoding used for transmission or storage is called the ` destination word . ' the number of bits available for a destination word is called the ` rate . '",
    "the choice of distortion measure is usually a selection of which aspects of the source word are relevant in the setting at hand , and which aspects are irrelevant ( such as noise ) .",
    "for example , in application to lossy compression of a sound file this results in a compressed file where , among others , the very high and very low inaudible frequencies have been suppressed .",
    "the distortion measure is chosen such that it penalizes the deletion of the inaudible frequencies but lightly because they are not relevant for the auditory experience .",

    "classical rate - distortion theory was initiated by shannon in  @xcite . in  @xcite shannon",
