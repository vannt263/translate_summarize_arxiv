    "radio - guided surgery ( rgs ) is a technique that enables the surgeon to evaluate in real time the completeness of the tumor lesion resection . at the same time rgs allows to minimise the amount of healthy tissue removed .",
    "it represents a significant adjunct to intra - operative detection of millimetre - sized tumor residues , providing the surgeon with vital and real - time information regarding the location and the extent of the lesion .",
    "it is crucial for those tumors where surgical resection is the only possible therapy , since it reduces the probability of tumor recurrence assessing surgical resection margins .",
    "rgs makes use of a radio - labelled tracer and of a probe .",
    "the radiopharmaceutical is administered to the patient before surgery and its uptake has to be higher in the tumor than in healthy organs , allowing to discriminate among them .",
    "traditional rgs makes use of @xmath1 emitters as tracer  @xcite .",
    "however , the use of this technique is strongly limited , and often even prevented , by the background produced from the uptakes of the healthy tissue .",
    "such a background is non - negligible because @xmath1 radiation can travel through large amounts of tissue .",
    "moreover , the large mean free path of @xmath1 radiation exposes the medical personnel to radiation risks .",

    "indeed , electrons have a very small penetration .",
    "therefore a @xmath0 rgs has a more favourable ratio between the signal coming from the tumor and the rest of the body .",
    "an ex - vivo test has shown the feasibility of this technique for a meningioma case  @xcite .",
    "meningioma has been chosen because it is known to express receptors to dotatoc  @xcite , a somatostatin analogue that could be labelled with @xmath2y , a pure @xmath0 emitter with a 2.3  mev electron energy endpoint .",
    "limiting to such radio - tracer , though , would mean restricting this technique to very few tumors , mainly glioma  @xcite and neuro - endocrine tumors  @xcite . to further broaden the applicability of the technique , the use of different radio - isotopes , with larger gamma contamination and lower endpoint is under investigation .    among the @xmath0-emitting radio - isotopes that have the largest diffusion in nuclear therapy  @xcite , we considered those that have an electron energy end - point of at least 500 kev , dominant @xmath1 lines below 300 kev and total @xmath1 intensities below 100% : @xmath4p , @xmath12i , @xmath8i , @xmath9sm , @xmath13lu , and @xmath6re .",
    "in addition we considered isotopes that are chemically in the same family as nuclides already used to mark tracers since these are the best candidates to give life to a new radio - tracer .",
    "we thus included in our studies @xmath3si , @xmath11cu , @xmath7br , and @xmath5zr . the characteristics of the decays of the considered isotopes are detailed in tab .  [",
    "tab : beta- ] .",
    "another alternative is to consider @xmath10f , which has @xmath19  h and a @xmath20 emission with end - point at 633.5  kev and 97% intensity and is used to radio - label the fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) .",
    "the uptake of the latter is the same as glucose , which in turn is correlated with tissue metabolism .",
    "it is widely used as marker for the positron emission tomography ( pet ) and , therefore , if the developed probe were sensitive to @xmath10fwith low background there would be a significant extension of the applicability of the technique . it is to be noted that in this case the probe would detect the positrons before they stop or annihilate , while annihilation photons would represent a background .",
    "the possibility to intra - operatively detect @xmath20 decays has already been explored in the past  @xcite with the development of ad - hoc dual detectors for the simultaneous measurement of positrons and @xmath1s . the difficulties in developing and handling the probe has limited the clinical studies  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the laboratory tests performed to measure the probe efficiency to @xmath1 and @xmath21 radiations , studies that are the basis for the extention of the technique to radio - isotopes other than the baseline @xmath2y . to investigate potentialities of radiations significantly different ,",
    "several sources with different @xmath21 spectra and gamma lines were used .    after tuning the simulation on these measurements , the expected signal from tumor and background assuming to use the different possible radionuclides of tab .  [",
    "tab : beta- ] was estimated .",
    "finally in the comparison among radio - isotopes we also estimated the expected dose rate delivered to the medical personnel during surgery .",
    "this requirement , in addition to the need to minimize the dose to the patient , limits the activity that can be administered .",

    "the lower black part in the picture is a ring of external diameter in acrilonitrile butadiene stirene ( abs ) that shields the sensitive element content in it from the radiation coming from the side .",
    "the sensitive part of the probe is a height and diameter of mono - crystalline para - terphenyldoped to 0.1% in mass with diphenylbutadiene .",
    "this plastic scintillator was adopted because of its high light yield ( @xmath223 times larger than typical organic scintillators ) , non - hygroscopic property , and low density  @xcite that minimises the sensitivity to photons .",
    "the light tightness around the scintillator is ensured by a thick aluminum sheet .",
    "the scintillation light is read out by a sipm ( sensl b - series 10035 ) biased with .",
    "its spectral range is @xmath23 and the peak wavelength is .",
    "an aluminum cylindrical body ( diameter and length ) encapsulates this assembly .",
    "a portable electronics based on ardusipm , with ethernet connection to a pc was used for the read out  @xcite .",
    "we measured the probe sensitivity to the radiation emitted by several long life - time radioisotopes with different energies , contained in sealed sources and in liquid @xmath10fsamples .",
    "they contain radio - isotopes by definition different from the ones of interest to rgs , which requires half - lives shorter than few days .",

    "the estimate of the expected performances of the @xmath0 probe prototype in case of use of @xmath20 radio - tracers for intra - operatorial use requires an estimate of the signal from the tumor and of the background coming from the uptake of radio - tracer from the rest of the body .",
    "these measurements need a simulation properly reproducing the measurements on the sources .",
    "furthermore , this study aims to quantify the efficiency on electrons and photons as a function of their energies and this also requires a detailed simulation .",
    "to this aim , the fluka monte carlo ( mc ) code  @xcite was used for a full simulation of the probe and of the experimental setups . from the geometry of the setup and of the probe",
    "the program estimates the energy released in the interaction of the decay products of the radio - nuclides with the detector and produces 28000 optical photons per of deposited energy  @xcite . to increase the simulation precision , the @xmath33 rays production threshold and the electron transport threshold",
    "have been set to in the scintillator and in the material in contact with it .",
    "moreover , in these materials the electrons step size has been limited to make them lose no more than 1% of their energy per step .",
    "this allows to accurately reproduce the optical photons generation points and the @xmath33 rays production at the interface with the scintillator . in all the other materials",
    "the transport threshold of all the particles and the @xmath33 ray production threshold are set at .",
    "the path of the optical photons is traced within the probe and the number of optical photons reaching the light detector ( sipm ) is counted ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "depends therefore on this threshold .",
    "the simulation has several parameters which need to be set empirically .",
    "the ones that are most relevant for this analysis are related to the optical properties of the para - terphenyl , since they determine the conversion between the released energy and @xmath34 . while the attenuation length has been measured to be @xmath372  cm , the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath38 expressed in @xmath39 ) and the reflectivity ( @xmath40 ) of the aluminum - wrapping were varied to find the configuration that best reproduces the measurements .",
    "finally also @xmath35 , related to the electronic threshold applied at readout , is optimized on data .",
    "the optimization of these parameters is based on the measurement of the maximum observed rates in the scans over @xmath41 sealed sources described in sec .  [",

    "the acquired information was then combined to estimate the minimum time needed to identify a tumor residue or the minimum specific activity that needs to be administered to have a timely response from the probe .      to estimate the signal that we would measure from a small residue embedded in healthy tissue ,",

    "to increase the simulation efficiency , and to average on different possible positions of the probe with respect to the patient body , 50 replicas of the probe were simulated and the average counting rate ( @xmath56 ) , scaled for the total activity in the patient , was considered as background rate .",
    "the probes were conservatively placed on the abdomen of the patient .    to avoid double counting",
    "the background from nearby healthy tissues , in the estimate of the far background contributions from decays in a fiducial volume around the probe were discarded .",
    "eventually , the signal expected when the probe is in contact with a tumor residue ( @xmath57 ) or healthy tissue ( @xmath58 ) are estimated as : @xmath59      the benchmark of the feasibility of the use of a given radiation is the activity that needs to be administered to have a significant signal in a reasonable time .",

    "<S> we study , with a set of laboratory tests and simulations , the prototype capability in case a different radio - nuclide is chosen among those used in nuclear medicine .    as a result we estimate the probe efficiency on electrons and photons as a function of energy and we evaluate the feasibility of a radio - guided surgery exploiting the selected radio - nuclides . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that requiring a 0.1  ml residue to be detected within 1  s by administering 3  mbq / kg of radio - isotope , the current probe prototype would yield a significant signal in a vast range of values of suv and tnr in case @xmath3si,@xmath4p , @xmath5zr , and @xmath6re are used . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , a tuning of the detector would be needed to efficiency use @xmath7br , @xmath8i , and @xmath9sm , although they could already be used in case of high suv or tnr values . </S>",
