    "recently , wireless security has attracted a lot of attentions from both academia and industry , and various approaches have been adopted to enhance the security of wireless networks among different layers of communication protocols @xcite . among others ,",
    "physical layer security techniques have been proposed as promising solutions to achieve perfect wireless secrecy against malicious eavesdropping attacks , and there are extensive studies in the literature investigating physical layer security techniques under different system setups ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these existing works focus on preserving the confidentiality of wireless communications by assuming communication users to be legitimate and viewing the information eavesdropping as malicious attacks .",
    "however , from a broader national security perspective , they overlook the possibility that communication links can also be used by criminals or terrorists and the resultant problems for information surveillance .    with recent advancements in wireless technologies ,",
    "a large number of wireless communication links are established for various industrial and commercial applications .",
    "for example , people can easily purchase unregistered smartphones to send secret data , and use unmanned vehicles equipped with cameras to take photos or videos and send them back in real time @xcite . by using these",
    "advanced wireless devices , criminals or terrorists may establish wireless communication links to commit crimes or terror attacks . as a response",
    ", there is a growing need for government agencies to legitimately monitor these suspicious communication links .",
    "for instance , the national security agency ( nsa ) of the united states has launched the terrorist surveillance program for legitimate information surveillance @xcite to monitor wireless devices .    to cope with the increasing information monitoring",
    "needs in wireless security , in this paper we propose a paradigm shift from the conventional physical layer security against _ illegitimate eavesdropping _ to the new information surveillance exploiting _",
    "legitimate eavesdropping_. in particular , we consider a wireless scenario as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] , where a legitimate monitor aims to intercept a suspicious communication link from a transmitter to a receiver over fading channels .",
    "we assume that the suspicious communication is a conventional wireless system that does not employ the physical - layer security techniques .",
    "this is a practical consideration , since it is difficult for the suspicious transmitter to know the existence of the legitimate eavesdropper and obtain the channel state information ( csi ) of the eavesdropping channel . under this setup ,",
    "the legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop ( decode ) the suspicious communication only when the received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and accordingly the achievable data rate at the legitimate monitor is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver , since in this case the legitimate monitor is able to decode the whole information that can be decoded at the suspicious receiver . in practice ,",
    "such legitimate eavesdropping is particularly challenging , since the legitimate monitor may be far away from the suspicious transmitter and can not eavesdrop efficiently .",
    "this motivates us to design new methods to improve the legitimate eavesdropping performance in this work .",
    "the main results of this paper are listed as follows .",
    "= 1     * we propose a proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming approach ( see fig . [ fig:0 ] ) , in which the legitimate monitor operates in a full - duplex mode , and purposely sends jamming signals to interfere with the suspicious link , so as to decrease the achievable data rate at the suspicious receiver for overhearing more efficiently . to maximize the effectiveness of jamming for eavesdropping ,",
    "it is important for the legitimate monitor to cognitively control the jamming power according to different fading states under its limited jamming power constraint . * in particular",
    ", we consider two different applications ( i.e. , delay - sensitive and delay - tolerant applications ) for the suspicious communication , under which the legitimate monitor is interested in maximizing the eavesdropping non - outage probability and the relative eavesdropping rate ( to the suspicious link s rate ) , respectively .",
    "accordingly , we formulate two optimization problems for the legitimate monitor , by optimizing its jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to an average power constraint .",
    "the formulated problems are in general non - convex and difficult to be solved . * for the delay - sensitive applications , the eavesdropping non - outage probability maximization problem is shown to be irrespective of the transmit power allocation strategies at the suspicious transmitter , and we obtain the optimal cognitive jamming solution via the lagrangian duality method . it is shown that the legitimate monitor jams only over the desired fading states when it can successfully eavesdrop ( after jamming ) .",
    "* for the delay - tolerant applications , the relative eavesdropping rate maximization problem depends critically on the power allocation strategies at the suspicious transmitter .",
    "in particular , we consider two commonly used transmit power allocation strategies ( i.e. , fixed power transmission and water - filling power allocation ) at the suspicious transmitter , and obtain the corresponding optimal cognitive jamming solutions for the legitimate monitor .",
    "it is shown that the legitimate monitor may also jam over the undesired fading states when it can not successfully eavesdrop ( even after jamming ) , since such jamming helps reduce the communication rate of the suspicious link in these fading states and therefore increase the percentage of successful eavesdropping rate in the desired fading states .",
    "* numerical results show that the proposed proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming approach greatly outperforms the conventional passive eavesdropping without jamming and the proactive eavesdropping with constant - power jamming .",
    "it is worth noting that our proposed proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming approach is different from the conventionally investigated jamming and eavesdropping attacks in the literature . in particular , the conventional wireless jamming has been investigated in the military applications such as in the battlefield communications , where only jamming is used to disrupt wireless communications ( e.g. , of enemies ) without eavesdropping considered ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in contrast , our paper utilizes jamming to facilitate the simultaneous eavesdropping at legitimate monitors .    on the other hand , how to prevent illegitimate passive eavesdropping has been investigated in , e.g. , @xcite , where the information - theoretic secrecy capacity has been adopted to achieve perfect wireless secrecy against it .",
    "recently , there have also been a handful of works investigating the secrecy capacity in the presence of active eavesdroppers that can both jam and eavesdrop @xcite",
    ". however , these existing works on the secrecy capacity focused on preserving the confidentiality of wireless communications by viewing the ( passive or active ) eavesdropping as illegitimate attacks , while in this paper we look at a new research angle by considering eavesdropping as legitimate monitoring from the surveillance perspective .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : ii ] presents the system model and formulates the eavesdropping non - outage probability and the relative eavesdropping rate maximization problems of our interest .",
    "section [ sec : iii ] develops the optimal solution to the eavesdropping non - outage probability maximization problem .",
    "sections [ sec : iv ] and [ sec : v ] propose the optimal solutions to the relative eavesdropping rate maximization problems by considering that the suspicious transmitter adopts fixed power transmission and water - filling power allocation , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : vi ] shows the numerical results to validate the performance of our proposed proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming approach .",
    "finally , section [ sec : vii ] concludes this paper .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig:0 ] , we consider a point - to - point suspicious wireless communication link from a transmitter to a receiver over a frequency non - selective channel , and there is a legitimate monitor aiming to eavesdrop this link . the suspicious transmitter and receiver are each deployed with a single antenna , and the legitimate monitor is equipped with two antennas , one for eavesdropping ( receiving ) and the other for jamming ( transmitting ) . therefore , the legitimate monitor can operate in a full - duplex mode to jam and eavesdrop at the same time .",
    "for the purpose of initial investigation , we assume that the legitimate monitor can perfectly cancel its self - interference from the jamming antenna to the eavesdropping antenna by using advanced analog and digital self - interference cancellation schemes @xcite , while the effect of non - ideal self - interference cancellation is left for our future work .",
    "we consider a block fading model , where the wireless channels remain constant over each block and may change from one block to another .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 denote the channel coefficients from the suspicious transmitter to the suspicious receiver , from the suspicious transmitter to the eavesdropping antenna of the legitimate monitor , and from the jamming antenna of the legitimate monitor to the suspicious receiver , respectively , where @xmath3 denotes the joint fading state .",
    "the corresponding channel power gains are denoted as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are assumed to be three random variables with a continuous joint probability density function ( pdf ) denoted by @xmath10 . to reveal the fundamental limit of legitimate eavesdropping , in this paper",
    "we assume that at each fading state @xmath3 , both the suspicious transmitter and receiver perfectly know the csi of the suspicious channel ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , while the legitimate monitor perfectly knows the global csi of suspicious , eavesdropping , and jamming channels ( i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) . ) based on channel estimation and feed it back to the transmitter , while the legitimate monitor can eavesdrop such feedback information to acquire @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the legitimate monitor can acquire the csi of eavesdropping and jamming channels ( i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) by using channel estimation based on the transmitted signals from the suspicious transmitter and receiver ( exploiting the channel reciprocity ) , respectively .",
    "] furthermore , the legitimate monitor perfectly knows the joint pdf @xmath10 based on the collected instantaneous csi .    let the message sent by the suspicious transmitter and the jamming signal generated by the legitimate monitor be denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , both of which are assumed to be circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variables with zero mean and unit variance",
    ". note that transmitting cscg signals is known to be the best strategy for both the information transmitter and the jammer ( i.e. , the legitimate monitor in our context ) @xcite .",
    "we consider that for each fading state @xmath3 , the suspicious transmitter employs the transmit power @xmath13 , and the legitimate monitor cognitively adjusts its jamming power to @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the maximum average transmit and jamming power at the suspicious transmitter and the legitimate monitor , respectively .",
    "thus we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the expectation over the joint fading state @xmath3 .",
    "then , the received signals at the suspicious receiver and the eavesdropping antenna of the legitimate monitor are respectively denoted as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 with zero mean and variances @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the additive white gaussian noises ( awgns ) at the suspicious receiver and the legitimate monitor , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the sinr at the suspicious receiver and the snr at the legitimate monitor receiver are respectively denoted as @xmath24 as a result , the achievable rates ( in bps / hz ) of the suspicious link and the eavesdropping link in the fading state @xmath3 are respectively denoted as @xmath25    based on the sinr @xmath26 at the suspicious receiver and the snr @xmath27 at the legitimate monitor for one particular fading state @xmath3 , we consider that the legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop the suspicious communication only when @xmath27 is no smaller than @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath29 or equivalently @xmath30 ) , since in this case the legitimate monitor can successfully decode the information sent in the suspicious link . here , in order to focus our study on the physical layer perspective , we have ignored the possible encryption and decryption methods that can be employed at higher layers in the suspicious user communication .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following indicator function to denote the event of successful eavesdropping at the legitimate monitor : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 indicate eavesdropping non - outage and outage events , respectively .",
    "note that the indicator function @xmath34 is irrespective of the transmit power @xmath35 at the suspicious transmitter .",
    "accordingly , we define the eavesdropping rate of the legitimate monitor at fading state @xmath3 as @xmath36    it is worth noting that the legitimate eavesdropping performance depends on different application scenarios for the suspicious communication . specifically , we consider both delay - sensitive and delay - tolerant suspicious applications , and define the corresponding legitimate eavesdropping performance metrics as follows",
    ".    first , consider delay - sensitive applications , in which the suspicious transmitter adopts non - zero transmit power @xmath35 over each fading state to deliver _ event - based information _ with strict delay constraints ( e.g. , real - time videos taken by its own camera ) , and the legitimate monitor aims to continuously track or monitor critical suspicious events . in this case , the delivered suspicious messages ( e.g. , the real - time video clips ) in different fading states have the same significance to report and infer such series of ongoing events , although they may be with different data rates ( e.g. , different resolutions ) due to the channel fading .",
    "under such an event - based scenario , it is beneficial for the legitimate monitor to successfully eavesdrop over as many fading states as possible . as a result",
    ", we introduce the eavesdropping non - outage probability , given by @xmath37 , as the event - based legitimate eavesdropping performance metric .",
    "then , we aim to maximize the eavesdropping non - outage probability @xmath37 by optimizing the jamming power allocation @xmath38 at the legitimate monitor subject to its average power constraint in ( [ eqn : p2:con1 ] ) , for which the optimization problem is formulated as @xmath39 since the eavesdropping non - outage probability @xmath34 is irrespective of the transmit power @xmath35 at the suspicious transmitter , it is evident that the optimal cognitive jamming solution to ( p1 ) is independent of the power allocation strategies employed at the suspicious transmitter . also note that problem ( p1 ) is non - convex in general , since its objective function is not concave over the jamming power allocation @xmath38 . despite the non - convexity",
    ", we will solve problem ( p1 ) optimally in section [ sec : iii ] .",
    "next , consider delay - tolerant applications , where the suspicious transmitter sends _ content - based information _",
    "( such as data files ) to the receiver and the monitor targets at data accumulation and content analysis . in this case , every transmitted bit may have the same significance to help content analysis , and it is thus desirable for the legitimate monitor to eavesdrop as many bits ( relative to the sent bits ) as possible . as a result , we use the relative eavesdropping rate , defined as the average eavesdropping rate over the average communication rate of the suspicious link , i.e. , @xmath40 , as the content - based legitimate eavesdropping performance criterion . in this case , the relative eavesdropping rate maximization problem for the legitimate monitor is formulated as @xmath41 problem ( [ problem : delay : insenstive ] ) is in general more challenging to be solved than ( p1 ) , which is due to the fact that the objective function in ( [ problem : delay : insenstive ] ) is non - concave and depends on the transmit power @xmath42 employed at the suspicious transmitter .",
    "it is difficult to solve problem ( [ problem : delay : insenstive ] ) under general power allocations at the suspicious transmitter . as a result , in sections [ sec : iv ] and [ sec : v ]",
    "we will solve problem ( [ problem : delay : insenstive ] ) under two commonly adopted transmission schemes for the suspicious transmitter , i.e. , fixed power transmission and water - filling power allocation , respectively .",
    "first , we consider problem ( p1 ) to maximize the eavesdropping non - outage probability for event - driven monitoring in delay - sensitive suspicious applications . although ( p1 ) is non - convex in general , one can verify that it satisfies the time - sharing condition defined in @xcite , as shown in the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma:1 ] let @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the optimal solutions to ( p1 ) under the average jamming power constraints @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "then for any @xmath47 , there always exists a feasible solution @xmath48 such that @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the corresponding @xmath51 in ( [ eqn : indictor ] ) under the given jamming power allocation @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this lemma can be proved by using a similar proof technique as in @xcite , for which the details are omitted for brevity .",
    "the time - sharing condition in lemma [ lemma:1 ] ensures that strong duality or zero duality gap holds between ( p1 ) and its lagrangian dual problem .",
    "therefore , we can use the lagrangian duality method to solve problem ( p1 ) optimally @xcite . the optimal solution to ( p1 )",
    "is obtained in the following proposition .",
    "[ proposition : p1 ] the optimal cognitive jamming solution to ( p1 ) is given as @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the optimal dual variable associated with the average jamming power constraint in ( [ eqn : p2:con1 ] ) .",

    ".    see appendix [ app : p1 ] .",
    "note that the optimal jamming power allocation @xmath61 depends on @xmath62 . for a fading state @xmath3 with @xmath63 ,",
    "the monitor can already overhear from the transmitter successfully without jamming .",

    "in this section , we consider problem ( [ problem : delay : insenstive ] ) to maximize the relative eavesdropping rate for content - driven monitoring in delay - tolerant suspicious applications , where the suspicious transmitter employs fixed power transmission , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "note that fixed power transmission is a commonly used strategy that is easy to implement at the transmitter , while we will consider the case with adaptive power transmission at the suspicious transmitter in section [ sec : v ] . with fixed power transmission ,",
    "we rewrite the achievable rate @xmath71 of the suspicious link in ( [ eqn : r0 ] ) as @xmath72 as a result , the relative eavesdropping rate maximization problem ( [ problem : delay : insenstive ] ) is reformulated as @xmath73    in the following , we solve problem ( p2 ) by first equivalently transforming it into solving a sequence of feasibility problems , and then using the lagrangian duality method to solve each feasibility problem .",
    "first , we introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath74 , and equivalently re - express problem ( p2 ) as @xmath75 then , we show that the optimal solution to problem ( p2.1 ) can be obtained by equivalently solving a sequence of feasibility problems each for a fixed @xmath74 and given by @xmath76 suppose that the optimal value of problem ( p2.1 ) is denoted as @xmath77 , where it must hold that @xmath78 .",
