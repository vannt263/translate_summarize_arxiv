    "dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "in addition , they are thought to be the single systems with the largest dark - matter contents , with m / l ratios as high as that of groups and poor clusters ( e.g. carignan and freeman 1988 ) and hence their spatial distribution and mass spectrum may give us important insights into the spatial scales over which mass is distributed .",
    "however , they are also the hardest galaxies to observe , due to their low - surface brightnesses and low luminosities .",
    "only recently it has become possible to obtain deep wide - field ccd _ photometry _ of significant numbers of these galaxies , mostly in clusters .",
    "_ spectroscopy _ of such low luminosity systems is still a challenge even with large - class telescopes , unless emission lines are present .",
    "dwarf galaxies in nearby clusters and groups have been studied in detail with photographic material ( e.g. coma : thompsom & gregory 1993 ; virgo : sandage , binggeli and tammann 1985 , impey et al .",
    "1988 ; fornax : ferguson 1989 ; bothun et al .",
    "1991 ; groups : ferguson and sandage 1991 ) . from these works",
    "two general trends were uncovered : 1 ) clusters and rich groups usually have a luminosity function with a faint end that is steeper , i.e. , has more low - luminosity galaxies , than that for poorer groups and 2 ) dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( de / ds0 ) seem to dominate the faint - end of the number counts in clusters while the dwarf - irregular population ( dirr ) are more representative in poor groups and in the field .",
    "point ( 1 ) was well illustrated by ferguson & sandage ( 1991 ) who found a faint - end slope ( fit to a schecter function ) of @xmath16 in the composite luminosity function of seven nearby groups ( the sample included the dorado group ) with a tendency for the richer groups to present a larger ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies than the poorer groups .",
    "point ( 2 ) has been challenged by observations of the most well known group of all , our own local group . despite being a poor group with just over 30 members ,",
    "the local group has a larger number of de / ds0 than of dirr ( pritchet & van den bergh 1999 ) . the majority of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies are concentrated around m31 and the milky way with a slope of the faint - end of the luminosity function ( fit to a schechter function ) of @xmath17 while the dwarf irregulars are less concentrated with a flat luminosity distribution ( van den bergh 1999 , grebel 2000 ) .",
    "this seems to contradict the results obtained for the cfa groups and field survey where the largest contribution to the steep faint - end was from the irregular galaxies ( marzke et al .",
    "recent results coming from ccd studies in nearby groups up to @xmath18 mpc show an increasing number of new dwarf members ( e.g. jerjen et al .",
    "2000 ) with a spatial distribution similar to that found in the local group ( i.e the dwarf spheroidals concentrated around the brightest galaxies while the irregulars distributed throughout the group ) .",
    "this is the first paper of a series dedicated to survey nearby groups with the aim of identifying low - surface brightness dwarf galaxies ( hereafter lsbd ) down to @xmath19 .",
    "our primary goal is to study the physical properties and luminosity distributions of the lsbd and ultimately determine the luminosity function of the groups as a function of their richness and other group parameters .",
    "here we report the results of the ccd photometry of the dwarf galaxy candidates of the nearby group of galaxies dorado .",
    "a further study will analyze other nearby groups of galaxies .",
    "the dorado group is a loose concentration of galaxies centered at @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( epoch j2000 ) .",
    "it is also known as shk 18 ( shakhbazian 1957 ) , g16 ( de vaucouleurs 1975 ) and hg3 ( huchra & geller 1982 ) .",
    "dorado was first identified by de vaucouleurs ( 1975 ) as a `` large and complex nebulae '' in the region of dorado . in 1982 ,",
    "huchra & geller ( 1982 ) , measured velocities for 18 galaxies in the group .",
    "maia et al . ( 1989 ) extended the number of known members to 46 .",
    "finally ferguson & sandage ( 1990 , 1991 ) , in a study of the galaxy properties in seven nearby groups identified 34 possible members of dorado with magnitudes @xmath22 in photographic plates .",
    "the central part of the group is dominated by two almost equally bright early - type systems : ngc1549 ( an e1 galaxy with @xmath23 km / s ) and ngc1553 ( an s0 galaxy with @xmath24 km / s ) .",
    "no detailed distance determination has been made for dorado and therefore we will adopt a group distance of 17.2 h@xmath25 mpc , where @xmath26 .",
    "this was determined for the central galaxy ngc1549 based on the d@xmath27-@xmath28 relation from faber et al .",
    "for the determination of the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies we chose the value of @xmath29 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 .",
    "the group covers an area on the sky of @xmath30 10@xmath31 10(@xmath30 3@xmath313 h@xmath25 mpc ) .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations , the data reduction and the methodology used to detect , classify and to obtain photometric parameters for galaxies in the frames . in that section",
    "we also describe the monte - carlo simulations performed in order to estimate the completeness for the lsbd population , and to determine the distribution of detected central surface brightness and scale lengths to be expected if local group and virgo - like lsbd were present in the dorado group . in section 3",
    "we present the results and analyze the central surface brightness , scale length , spatial and color distributions of the lsbd candidates .",
    "finally , in section 4 , a general discussion and a brief summary of the main results are presented .",
    "the luminosity function of the group will be determined , along with those for other groups , in a later publication .",
    "the dorado group was observed in two separate runs at the end of 1996 .",
    "the central region of the group was observed on november 12 , with the 0.9 m curtis / schmidt telescope at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( hereafter ctio ) .",
    "the images were obtained using a standard stis @xmath32 pixel ccd with 21 @xmath33 pixels corresponding to 2.028@xmath34/pixel on the sky .",
    "the total field of view was 1@xmath3515 @xmath31 1@xmath3515 .",
    "the second set of observations was performed with the 1.0 m swope telescope at the las campanas observatory ( hereafter lco40 ) , chile , in the nights of december 2 - 7 , 1996 . in this case",
    "the tektronix 5 ccd , with @xmath32 21-@xmath33 pixels ( 0@xmath36696 on the sky ) was used .",
    "the total field of view per image was 24@xmath31 24 .",
    "the fields were imaged through standard johnson @xmath0 and cousins @xmath1 filters .",
    "typical total exposure times were between 30 and 60 min per field in both filters .",
    "all data were taken under photometric conditions , with a seeing ranging from 1@xmath363 to 1@xmath369 in the lco40 frames .",
    "due to the large pixel size of the ccd used in the observations taken at ctio ( 2.028/pix ) , the image quality in the central field is much worse than that for the lco40 images ( @xmath303 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the observation log ( field identification , equatorial coordinates , filters , observatories , exposure times , the observed area and the area used on the analysis after the masked pixels were disregarded ) where d01 is the central field observed in ctio and d02 to d11 are the fields observed in lco40 .",
    "the total area covered by the observations was @xmath30 2@xmath356 ( @xmath30 1@xmath352 in the central region and @xmath30 1@xmath354 spread over the outskirts of the group ) in each of the filters .",
    "after subtraction and masking the bright objects in the fields , the total area used in the analysis was @xmath37@xmath354 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the sizes and locations of the observed ccd images .",
    "the symbols indicate the galaxies with known velocities taken from the ned .",
    "in addition , we observed two fields 10north ( b3 ) and 15south ( b4 ) of the fornax galaxy ngc 1399 , in order to estimate the background contamination of low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "these observations were performed in the second run ( lco40 ) , with the same filters and exposure times matching the dorado lco40 observations ( see table 1 for details ) .      the images were bias / overscan - subtracted and trimmed , using the ccdproc task inside iraf .",
    "dome and twilight flats were combined with the object - frames taken during the night to make a master flat - field and used to flat - field the data .",
    "the images were then combined by obtaining their median .",
    "the final combined images had an average _ rms _ pixel - to - pixel variation of the sky level that corresponded to a limiting surface brightness of @xmath38 ( ctio ) and @xmath39 @xmath0 mag / arcsec@xmath3 ( lco40 ) for the @xmath0 filter and @xmath40 ( ctio ) and @xmath41 ( lco40 ) for the i filter . in the case of the lco40",
    "i frames , there were small scale variations along the ccd and since these could affect the analysis of the structural parameters of the lsbd , we decided to do the photometry on the i images using the v images as templates ( i.e. using the same positions , ellipticities and areas obtained for objects in the v filter ) .",
    "the main use of the i photometry was to determine aperture colors for the objects .",
    "calibrations of the magnitudes to the standard system were derived using observations of standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "a number of standard stars were observed throughout the nights for that purpose : 26 and 22 during the two nights for ctio and 42 , 46 , 47 , 47 and 44 in the five nights for lco40 .",
    "the task apphot in iraf was used to determine the instrumental magnitudes of the stars .",
    "transformation equations from the instrumental to the standard johnson - kron - cousins system were obtained using the following relation :    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44+a^{i}_{1}x_{i}-a^{v}_{1}x_{v } } { 1-(a^{v}_{2}-a^{i}_{2})}\\ ] ]    where _ v _ and _ i _ are the instrumental aperture magnitudes of the standard stars , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the transformation coefficients between the standard and instrumental system , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the extinction coefficients , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the coefficients of the color term .",
    "the calibration equations and coefficients for both ctio and lco40 runs are given in table 2 ( col .",
    "the _ rms _ of the difference between standard and calibrated magnitudes for the standard stars is less than 0.025 mag ( col . 5 in table 2 ) .",
    "we can see in table 2 that the color coefficients are small and stable during the nights ( lco40 observations ) .",
    "the zero point for each filter was obtained using the two first equations of ( 1 ) and the coefficients given in table 2 with an assumed color index of @xmath51 , a typical value for the lsbd population in nearby groups and clusters like virgo ( impey & bothun 1997 ) . magnitudes and colors were then calibrated accordingly .",
    "detection , photometry and classification of objects were performed using the source extractor ( sextractor ) software program ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . before running sextractor",
    ", we removed all bright galaxies and saturated stars .",
    "these are necessary steps since otherwise the bright objects may have either prevented detection of faint sources or significantly affected the photometry of objects located in their wings .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the central region of the dorado group observed at ctio ( upper panel ) with some examples of low surface brightness dwarf galaxies detected in this region ( see below ) .",
    "the four brightest galaxies in the field , ngc1549 , ngc1553 , ngc1546 and ic2058 are marked on the figure ( upper panel ) .",
    "these four galaxies were extracted from the frames , first by fitting their isophotes using the task stsdas.isophotes.ellipse .",
    "then , their fitted ellipses were subtracted from the frame using the task bmodel .",
    "objects which were poor fits to elliptical isophotes were simply masked .",
    "masking was also used to remove bright saturated stars and the remaining residuals from the bright elliptical galaxies subtraction . the same procedures were applied to subtract or mask the bright galaxies and stars from the lco40 frames . in these frames",
    "only one galaxy was subtracted using the fitting technique ( ngc1536 in d05 ) .",
    "these pixels , corresponding to the masked areas , were not used in subsequent analysis .",
    "the analysis of the image with sextractor proceeded as follow : _",
    "i ) _ in each ccd image the background map was constructed using sub - areas of @xmath52 pixels ( @xmath53 arcsec ) and @xmath54 pixels ( @xmath55 arcsec ) for ctio and lco40 images respectively .",
    "these values are much larger than the typical size of a low - surface brightness galaxy that could be detected at the distance of the group ( searches for larger galaxies were conducted in section 2.7 ) ; _ ii ) _ the local background histogram was clipped iteratively until convergence at @xmath56 was reached .",
    "these raw background values were filtered using a median filter ( in 3 @xmath31 3 sub - areas ) , and a bi - cubic - spline was used to obtain the resulting background map .",
    "this background map was then subtracted from the image ; _ iii ) _ the images were convolved with a _ top - hat _ mask with a fwhm slightly larger than the values for the stellar images , in order to enhance the efficiency in detecting low - surface brightness , extended objects .",
    "all objects with a threshold @xmath57 26 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 ( @xmath30 1.2@xmath58 and @xmath30 1.7@xmath58 for the ctio and lco40 frames respectively ) above the sky level and with a minimum area of 5 pix@xmath3 were found and their photometric parameters obtained ( note that a threshold of @xmath30 1.2@xmath58 for the lco40 images correspond to a limiting surface brightness of @xmath30 26.6 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 , i.e. 0.6 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 fainter than our limiting surface brightness ) .",
    "we used a threshold of 26 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 in order to have a common surface brightness cut in both the ctio and the lco40 fields .",
    "photometry of all objects in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 frames was done using elliptical apertures .",
    "total magnitudes were computed using the kron s `` first moment '' algorithm @xmath59 ( kron 1980 , infante 1987 ) . for each object ,",
    "the elliptical apertures are chosen and the ellipticity and the position angle are defined by the second - order moments of the light distribution .",
    "the maximum aperture is then defined as one that has double the area of the isophotal elliptical aperture .",
    "inside this aperture , the integrated light is used to construct a growth curve where the first moment is computed . as discussed by infante ( 1987 ) and infante & pritchet ( 1992 ) , the @xmath60 measures about 90% of the flux for galaxies with exponential profiles , and about 96% for objects with stellar profiles .",
    "we checked these values with monte carlo simulations ( see section 2.6 ) .",
    "it may also underestimate the true total magnitude for galaxies with @xmath61 intensity profiles , as suggested by secker & harris ( 1997 . however , the number of faint group galaxies with @xmath61 is small .",
    "the object detection was performed in the v filter and was used as a template to obtain the photometric parameters in the i filter ( i.e. we forced the detection in the i filter of those objects detected in the v filter using common structural parameters ) .",
    "the output catalogues in both filters were then matched in order to obtain color information for all objects .",
    "colors were determined by measuring magnitudes in a circular aperture of 7   of diameter in the ctio field and 4   in the lco40 fields , in both filters .",
    "those objects centered within @xmath62of any edge or masked region in the images were deleted from the catalogues .",
    "the output matched catalogues ( available under request ) contain the isophotal magnitude , the isophotal area , the total magnitude , the ellipticity , eight isophotal areas which correspond to different surface brightnesses ( see section 2.5 ) , the peak surface brightness in mag / arcsec@xmath3 ( this corresponds to the intensity at the central pixel ) , coordinates at epoch j2000.0 , a quality flag and the star / galaxy classification for each object .",
    "the completeness of our sample for point sources falls below 90% at magnitudes @xmath63 mag and @xmath64 mag for the ctio and lco40 observations respectively ( see section 2.6 ) . for the @xmath1 fields , the completeness falls to 90% at magnitudes @xmath65 mag and @xmath66 mag for the ctio and lco40 observations respectively .",
    "the star / galaxy separation ( resolved @xmath67 galaxies , unresolved @xmath67 stars , globular clusters , unresolved background galaxies ) was done with a neural network routine developed by bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is a training program that classifies objects with an index ( stellarity index ) between 0 ( galaxies ) and 1 ( stars ) .",
    "it uses eight isophotal areas ( see section 2.5 ) , the peak intensity , and the seeing to classify the objects .",
    "the star / galaxy separation works well down to @xmath68 ( ctio ) and @xmath69 ( lco40 ) .",
    "objects with magnitudes beyond this limit present an increasing scatter in the classification .    in order to check the star / galaxy classification given by sextractor we first did a visual inspection of all objects classified as galaxies with `` stellarity index '' less or equal than 0.3 .",
    "the choice of 0.3 is based on our monte carlo simulations ( section 2.6 ) since galaxies that mimic local group lsbd at the distance of dorado are classified in all cases with stellarity indices lower than 0.3 .",
    "eye control showed that the classification of galaxies is adequate down to @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the ctio and lco40 respectively . for fainter magnitudes , the classification is uncertain .",
    "an alternative method was used to check the classification .",
    "this method consisted in plotting pairs of parameters like the central intensity _",
    "vs. _ area , the central intensity _ vs. _ size of the objects , and the peak intensity _ vs. _ size of the objects . for each plot ,",
    "a curve was drawn in order to define the boundaries between stars and galaxies .",
    "then , the classifications obtained from each of the three plots were combined to assign to each object a probability that it is a star , a galaxy or noise .",
    "we found that @xmath72% of the galaxies were classified identically by this method , by sextractor ( `` stellarity index '' @xmath73 ) and by the visual inspection down to @xmath68 and @xmath69 mag for the ctio and the lco40 frames respectively .",
    "the remaining objects were difficult to classify and these were labeled with an `` uncertain '' flag .",
    "selection of the lsbd candidates was done using parameters given by the exponential profile fit ( the central surface brightness and scale length ) , and the diameter at the limiting isophote .",
    "below we describe in detail our procedure .",
    "the radial profile of the galaxies can be represented by a generalized exponential law or sersic law of the form :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the central surface brightness , @xmath76 is the scale factor and @xmath77 is the generalized exponent . the surface brightness profile of disk galaxies and dwarf galaxies fainter than @xmath78 are , in general ,",
    "well fit by a pure exponential law , with @xmath79 in ( [ equ3 ] ) ( faber & lin 1993 , binggeli & cameron 1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "the fit to a pure exponential law was used to obtain the extrapolated central surface brightness and the scale length of the lsbd candidates in our sample . for each of the eight isophotal areas given by sextractor we obtained the surface brightness and the radius using a relation of the form    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the surface brightness at the pixel of maximum intensity , @xmath82 is the surface brightness at the limiting isophote , and @xmath83 is the surface brightness at the given isophotal area .",
    "each value of the surface brightness corresponds to a radius @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the elongation and @xmath86 is the isophotal area at the _ i_-label given by sextractor . using the values for @xmath83 from ( [ equ4 ] )",
    ", we made a least - squares fit to obtain the extrapolated central surface brightness and the scale lengths for each galaxy .",
    "we used the extrapolated central surface brightness and scale length given by the fit as the main parameters to allow a primary cut on the catalogue .",
    "all galaxies with central surface brightnesses fainter than @xmath87 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 and scale lengths h@xmath883@xmath360 and h@xmath89@xmath360 for the ctio and lco40 observations respectively were selected ( note that the seeing strongly affects these structural parameters for @xmath90 and 2@xmath91 respectively ) .",
    "this surface brightness cut is similar to that used by dalcanton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to study the number counts of lsbd in the local universe and is one magnitude fainter that the value used by oneil et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to search for low - surface brightness galaxies in the pegasus and cancer clusters .",
    "the first cut on the data selected 777 objects in all fields .",
    "the second cut was done selecting galaxies with a limiting diameter @xmath92at the limiting surface brightness of 26 v mag / arcsec@xmath93 .",
    "the diameter at the limiting isophote ( limiting diameter hereafter ) can be expressed also by the parameters given by the exponential fit ( allen & shu 1989 ) :    @xmath94    where @xmath82 is the surface brightness at the limiting isophote of 26 v mag / arcsec@xmath93 , @xmath75 is the extrapolated central surface brightness , and @xmath95 is the total magnitude of the objects . in our case ,",
    "a diameter of @xmath96   represents well the expected sizes of lsbd that can be detected .",
    "this is supported by monte - carlo simulations ( see next section ) , which show that the fraction of detected lsbd with exponential profiles with @xmath97 ( @xmath98 for lco40 fields ) and diameters @xmath99 is @xmath100% down to @xmath70 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the second cut on the data ( size limit ) limited the sample to 144 lsbd candidates .",
    "each of these galaxies were inspected visually and 84 of them were discarded .",
    "we eliminated these galaxies based on the _ flag _ of the photometric quality ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "we found that all objects with _ flag _",
    "@xmath101 have a bright object in their proximity ( with the additional contaminating light from the nearby bright source , the false lsbd s were artificially included in our catalogue ) .",
    "this last cut limited the sample to 60 lsbd candidates .",
    "the same selection criteria were used to find lsbd in the two control fields ( lco40 ) in order to estimate the contribution of background galaxies to the luminosity function .",
    "we found only one galaxy in both control fields with @xmath102 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 , diameter @xmath9 , scale length @xmath8 .",
    "this galaxy seems to be a genuine low - surface brightness galaxy in the field with apparent magnitude @xmath103 and color @xmath104 .",
    "in addition to the 60 lsbd galaxies , we found five lsbd galaxies in the lco40 fields with @xmath102 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 , scale length @xmath8and diameter @xmath9at the limiting surface brightness of @xmath105 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 ( see section 2.7.1 ) .",
    "table 3 lists the photometric data and the profile fitting parameters of the lsbd detected in the group ( the last four lines of the table correspond to the large lsbd namely l01 to l04 - see section 2.7 ) .",
    "the data are given as follows : column 1 provides the galaxy identification ; columns 2 and 3 list the equatorial coordinates at the epoch 2000.0 ; columns 4 and 5 show the `` total '' magnitude ( sextractor `` auto '' magnitude , not corrected according to the simulations and not corrected by interstellar absorption ) in @xmath0 and the @xmath106 colors within apertures of 7and 4 in diameter for ctio and lco40 data respectively ; columns 6 and 7 list the limiting isophotal diameter and the diameter given by relation ( [ equ5 ] ) at the surface brightness of 26 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 ; the extrapolated central surface brightness @xmath107 and the scale lengths are given in columns 8 and 9 ; the next two columns ( 10 and 11 ) show the effective radius and mean effective surface brightness ; the last column shows the morphological type ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "the effective radius in column 10 , defined as the radius of the isophote that contains half of the total light , can be represented , in the case of a pure exponential law , by @xmath108 and the mean effective surface brightness ( column 11 ) by @xmath109 ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ) .",
    "the equatorial coordinates in table 3 ( columns 2 and 3 ) were determined using 20 - 30 stars from the guide star catalogue present on the images giving an accuracy in the position of less than 2 .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations in order to determine : _ i ) _ the completeness for point sources ; _ ii ) _ the completeness for lsbd galaxies ( i.e. the fraction of them detected with the automatic detection described in section 2.3 ) ; and _ iii ) _ the uncertainties in the photometry of the lsbd galaxies .",
    "the simulations were performed on the science frames in order to have the same characteristics of a real image ( cosmetic defects , crowded images , light gradients , noise and seeing ) .",

    "we assumed that the lsbd have an exponential profile .",
    "for each image , we simulated galaxies with exponential profiles with different scale lengths , central surface brightnesses and random ellipticities .",
    "each image was convolved with a point spread function constructed from bright stars in the frame .",
    "the method implemented was the following : _",
    "i ) _ for each bin of central surface brightness we generated 400 randomly distributed disk galaxies in groups of 20 ( five for the brightest bins ) with magnitudes between 16.0  20.0 and 16.0 - 22.0 for the ctio and lco40 frames respectively .",

    "this result shows our limitation in estimating in a correct way the scale length of our real galaxies especially at small sizes .",

    "the limiting surface brightness imposed by the central field of @xmath130 represents 1.7@xmath58 in the lco40 fields taken in the outskirts of the group .",
    "we therefore made an additional search for galaxies with diameters larger than 14  but at limiting isophotal level of 26.5 v mag / arcsec@xmath93 ( or 1.2@xmath58 ) only on the lco40 fields . in this way we discovered five new galaxies that are listed in table 3 with a `` d '' , where `` d '' stands for deep .",
    "the inclusion or exclusion of these galaxies in the analysis described below does not change the results .",
    "as described in section 2.3 , the sky subtraction was done by taking the median values for image sections of @xmath131 pixels and @xmath132 pixels in size .",
    "this limiting size , used for making the background map could erase any signs of larger galaxies in our frames , if they were present .",
    "we then repeated the reduction procedure using background sub - sections of 128 and 256 and re - did searches for galaxies with larger sizes .",
    "this was done by smoothing the images after masking all high - surface brightness objects .",

    "the original data can provide additional information on any low - surface brightness features detected after smoothing .",
    "the procedure used was the following : _ i _ ) all objects with 3@xmath28 above sky were masked and substituted by the appropriate sky noise of each image ; _ ii ) _ an additional area around each object in ( _ i _ ) was also masked in the same way , to ensure that all high - surface brightness areas of the image were masked .",
    "a 2-pixel `` growing radius '' was used for this purpose ( i.e. , the radius of each object in ( _ i _ ) was incremented by 2 pixel for masking ) ; _ iii _ ) the `` clean '' image from ( _ ii _ ) was convolved with gaussian functions of different widths and for each resulting image we ran sextractor in order to look for large remaining low - surface brightness objects ; _ iv ) _ the photometry of the objects detected in the smoothing images were done in the original frames using the convolved images as templates . at this point , we also did an eye inspection of the images to check if the automatic search with sextractor had lost any objects .",
    "in this way a number of new very low - surface brightness objects were uncovered in the ctio frame ( four galaxies ) .",
    "no additional galaxies were found in the lco40 frames at 1@xmath28 sky level .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 and @xmath1 ccd photometry of suspected low - surface brightness dwarf galaxies detected in a survey covering @xmath2 deg@xmath3 around the central region of the dorado group of galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> the selected galaxies have magnitudes brighter than @xmath5 ( @xmath6 for an assumed distance to the group of 17.2 mpc ) , with central surface brightnesses @xmath7 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 , scale lengths @xmath8 , and diameters @xmath9at the limiting isophote . using these criteria </S>",
    "<S> , we identified 69 dwarf galaxy candidates . </S>",
    "<S> four of them are large very low - surface brightness galaxies that were detected on a smoothed image , after masking high surface brightness objects . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations performed to estimate completeness , photometric uncertainties and to evaluate our ability to detect extended low - surface brightness galaxies show that the completeness fraction is , on average , @xmath10% for dwarf galaxies with @xmath11 and @xmath12 v mag / arcsec@xmath3 , for the range of sizes considered by us ( @xmath13 14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 colors of the dwarf candidates vary from -0.3 to 2.3 with a peak on @xmath15 , suggesting a range of different stellar populations in these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the projected surface density of the dwarf galaxies shows a concentration towards the group center similar in extent to that found around five x - ray groups and the elliptical galaxy ngc1132 studied by mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1999 ) , suggesting that the dwarf galaxies in dorado are probably physically associated with the overall potential well of the group . </S>"
