    "more than two decades ago the notion of the entanglement for mixed quantum states of a composite system was worked out by werner @xcite . since then",
    "a lot of work has been done to develop efficient separability criteria and to design useful measures of quantum entanglement .",
    "although several possible quantities have been proposed and analyzed @xcite there is still a need for an efficient measure of quantum entanglement which could be accessible in a real  life experiment @xcite .    to get a full information about the analyzed quantum state one can perform the scheme of quantum tomography , which allows one to determine the degree of quantum entanglement @xcite",
    "however , the full scheme of quantum tomography requires a large number of measurements , thus , it becomes not practical for a higher dimensional systems .",
    "therefore one can pose a question how to get the maximal information about the degree of entanglement of a given state performing relatively few measurements .",
    "some progress in this direction was achieved in @xcite , in which a quantity based on collective measurements performed on several copies of the system investigated was proposed .",
    "this quantity , called _ collectibility _ , was defined for any pure state of a general composite quantum system , containing an arbitrary number of @xmath0 subsystems , each describing @xmath1level system .",
    "deriving inequalities analogous to entropic uncertainty relations @xcite we established separability criteria based on collectibility . to detect entanglement in the simplest two  qubit system we proposed a four  photon experiment @xcite based on hong  ou  mandel interference @xcite .",
    "entanglement criteria based on pure  state collectibility are reviewed in section [ sec : pure ] .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to generalize the notion of collectibility and the related separability criteria to the general case of mixed quantum states . to this end",
    "we shall propose two strategies .",
    "firstly , in order to generalize the experimental part we shall modify the pure  states separability criteria to take into account contributions related to impurities of both copies of the investigated state .",

    "an extended analysis of the above results is presented in section [ sec : experiment2 ] .    in the second strategy",

    "the starting point of our considerations shall be the original experimental setup @xcite with the pure state @xmath32 substituted by the mixed state @xmath33 shared by alice and bob .",
    "apart from two sources of the same copy of the state it involves the 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) , two polarization rotators @xmath34 in the same setting and the polarized beam splitters ( pbs )  see fig .",

    "a first natural effort to generalize the definition of the pure  state collectibility could be to rewrite the right hand side of the definition ( [ mcp ] ) in the following form @xmath94 one could suspect , that a simple modification @xmath95 will make the above formula suitable for an arbitrary mixed state @xmath96 . however , we require the _ mixed  state collectibility _ to be capable to identify entanglement . on the other hand",

    "since the state is mixed there is a contribution of a positive parameter @xmath222 on the right hand side so in this case the inequality holds and it is strict . finally , if the state is pure but maximally entangled then @xmath218 so the right hand side of ( [ bound - fundamental ] ) is equal to @xmath223 while the collectibility on the left side is equal to @xmath224 , as shown earlier in @xcite , so the inequality is violated by a factor of four .",
    "let us emphasize that the performed analysis leading to ( [ bound - fundamental ] ) is independent of the choice of the two complementary observables , so we may consider an _ optimization of the two dual inequalities _ over two measurements of the two complementary observables @xmath225 with the constraint @xmath195 .",
    "furthermore , let us observe that inequality ( [ bound - fundamental ] ) is a slightly stronger variant of the original result @xmath31\\leq1/16 $ ] valid for separable pure states .",
    "since the state is pure we shall put @xmath218 and @xmath219 in ( [ bound - fundamental ] ) , and obtain : @xmath226\\leq\\frac{g_{++}g_{--}}{4}\\leq\\frac{1}{16}.\\label{original - stronger}\\ ] ] the above inequality is useful for entanglement detection in the case of pure states that are not maximally entangled .",
    "let us make a remark on statistical properties of these inequalities .",
    "inequality ( [ bound - fundamental ] ) , as well as the separability criteria based on @xmath221 $ ] , involve the square root calculated on the difference of the measurable quantities in the form @xmath227 . while in theory the argument inside the root is always positive , in practice , due to experimental errors , a problems with the sign under the square root might appear .",
    "we shall keep in mind that the violation of the inequality is equivalent to , , passing  the entanglement test .",
    "the most natural approach is to use the term , , passed  to all cases where the quantity under the square root in lhs of ( [ bound - fundamental ] ) is strictly positive up to the error bars .",
    "this is actually the test of the quantity of the entanglement produced since in all entangled states the term @xmath228 becomes positive , sometimes in a very drastic way .",
    "for instance , for maximally entangled states the second term @xmath229 vanishes , and @xmath230 .",
    "therefore , testing the degree of entanglement of the state analyzed , we look for the case in which the number @xmath228 is significantly positive .",
    "this justifies the term , , violated  or the term , , passed  from the perspective of testing the entanglement property .",
    "finally , let us point out that other separability tests , based on a pair of inequalities ( [ bound ] ) and ( [ bound - dual ] ) or ( [ corrected1 ] ) and its dual , do not involve the problem discussed above .",
    "in fact , these inequalities seem to be more suitable for an experimental application . in this context the previous paragraph dealing with the issue of",
    "the square may seem to be of purely academic character .",
    "we keep it since the reasoning as it is has an element of the universality  in all the cases when the error may spoil the mathematics of the test formula one should look at the region of parameters in which the test really matters .",
    "in this work we generalized the collectibility  a quantity initially designed to characterize entanglement of pure quantum states  for mixed states .",
    "on one hand we improved existing expressions for pure  state collectibility by taking into account contributions due to non  maximal purity of the state investigated .",
    "this approach can be useful in practice to analyze experimentally states intended to be pure , which are characterized by a high purity .",
    "for the simplest case of two qubit system the proposed measurement scheme requires two copies of the state analyzed , so a possible optical setup involves four photon experiments .    for such pseudo  mixed states",
    "the essential element of the scheme is that one performs two measurements represented by the orthonormal bloch vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 corresponding to the two polarization rotations @xmath34 , and @xmath231 .",
    "this allows to avoid the assumption which was necessary in @xcite , that the state is pure .    on the other hand we introduced here a new notion of the mixed  state collectibility",
    " a quantity defined for an arbitrary mixed state of a composite system which contains @xmath0 subsystems , each describing an @xmath1level system .",
    "presence of the @xmath1th root in the definition ( [ mcm ] ) assures that it is consistent with the former notion of pure  state collectibility ( [ mcp ] ) . in the particular case of a pure state of a bipartite system the collectibility is shown to be a function of the negativity .",
    "moreover , in this case the collectibility depends on the minimal distance of the pure state analyzed to the closest maximally entangled state .",
    "explicit bounds for the mixed  state collectibility obtained for arbitrary quantum states , separable states and states with positive partial transpose belong to the key results of the present paper .",
    "they allow us to design practical tests for entanglement of a given state .",
    "such experimental schemes look realistic at least for the mixed state of a two qubit system , for which a four  photon experiment is necessary . we are thus tempted to believe that such experiments , useful to demonstrate quantum entanglement of a given state without performing its quantum tomography , will be realized in a near future .",
    "there are still few more questions for future research",
    ". one should explore possible structural connections of the present quantity to the symmetric measurement state reconstruction of the type proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and to the experimental discrimination of slocc ",
    "invariant classes @xcite .",
    "the directly related problem is the issue of lower bounds for typical entanglement measures ( like concurrence or the geometric measure ) based on the measurement reproducing collectibility in analogy to the standard approach ( see @xcite ) .",

    "ou  mandel setup . while the issue of finding some lower bounds for the latter ( two  qubit ) case is relatively easily tractable the analogous questions for higher dimensions and/or subsystems seem to require much more effort .",
    "finally , there is an intriguing question of the relation of the test designed for pseudopure entangled states to the entanglement criteria based on mutually unbiased bases ( mub  s ) provided in ref .",
