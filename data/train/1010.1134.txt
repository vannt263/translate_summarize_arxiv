    "the quantum pumping proposed by thouless@xcite is a phase coherence effect able to pump dc current by the out - of - phase adiabatic modulation of ( at least ) two system parameters in absence of a voltage bias .",

    ", brouwer@xcite formulated a scattering approach to the adiabatic quantum pumping showing that the dc charge current produced by the pump is related to the parametric derivatives of the scattering matrix of the device .",
    "following the brouwer formulation several studies , both of experimental@xcite and theoretical nature , have been performed .",
    "the theory of quantum pumping for noninteracting systems@xcite has been developed in several directions . in case of interacting electrons the computation of the pumped charge",
    "becomes rather involved and few works have addressed this issue for different systems@xcite and in specific regimes . as for the case of interacting quantum dots ,",
    "the pumped charge in a period was calculated by aono@xcite by exploiting the zero - temperature mapping of the kondo problem within non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) technique .",
    "a very general formalism was developed in ref .",
    "[ ] based on the adiabatic expansion of the self - energy in the average - time approximation , while a linear response scheme was employed in ref .",
    "another interesting study@xcite was performed aiming at generalizing brouwer s formula for interacting systems to include inelastic scattering events .",
    "alternatively to the negf approach , a powerful diagrammatic technique to treat the interacting quantum pumping is constituted by a generalized - master equation method@xcite .",
    "very recently the idea that the presence of an hidden classical variable inside a scattering region can strongly affect the dependence of the current pumped through the system has been proposed .",
    "this effect is produced by the dynamics of the classical variable which modifies the standard phase relation introducing a dynamical phase shift@xcite accompanied by _ parasitic _ contributions to the pumping current .    in this paper",
    "we develop a time dependent mean field slave boson theory for an interacting quantum dot following a non - equilibrium formulation _  la _ keldysh .",
    "in particular , we derive a time - dependent mean field equation for the slave boson and the constraints which allows us to study the strongly interacting regime of the pumping beyond the adiabatic ( i.e. zero frequency ) limit .",
    "however , since the cost of the analysis is growing with the degree of non - adiabaticity , in this work we focus on the almost adiabatic limit ( i.e. pumping frequency small but finite ) .",
    "in particular we focus on the effect of the dynamical phase of the slave boson on the pumped current , evidencing features not discussed before .",
    "furthermore , the proposal of a quantum pump able to produce spin current without polarized electrodes is also discussed .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in sec.[sec : model ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian and derive the free - fermions - like effective hamiltonian by means of the slave boson treatment . in sec.[sec : negf ] we derive the relevant green s functions within the keldysh approach and a formula for the pumping current is derived within the single photon approximation . in sec.[sec : constraints ] we analyze the constraint equations and propose an approximate solution suitable within the almost adiabatic limit . in sec.[sec : results ] we discuss the results obtained both in the case of a spin independent quantum pump and in the case of a spin sensitive device able to generate spin current .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a quantum dot ( qd)-based pump coupled to noninteracting leads .",
    "a particle flux is generated through the qd by means of an almost - adiabatic modulation of two out - of - phase gate voltages controlling the transparency of the tunneling barriers .",
    "+ the hamiltonian of the quantum pump depicted in fig.[fig : fig1 ] can be written as follows : @xmath4 where the operator @xmath5 creates an electron of momentum @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 in the lead @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is the creation operator of an electron state on the interacting quantum dot , @xmath10 being the energy of a single occupied electron state .",
    "the electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction energy @xmath0 , described by the third term , has to be considered when the dot screening length @xmath11 is bigger than the typical size of the quantum dot . the last term describes the tunneling between the quantum dot and the leads . in this work",
    "we are interested in describing the strongly interacting limit ( @xmath12)@xcite . in the intermediate @xmath0-regime the hilbert space of the isolated qd has electron states @xmath13 ( empty , single and doubly occupied ) which are created by application of the creation operator to the empty state @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( notice that the order is arbitrary but have to be fixed since @xmath17 ) . in the previous basis",
    "the relevant operators can be written as@xcite : @xmath18 and the canonical anti - commutation relations @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 can be obtained . in case of strong interaction ( @xmath12 )",
    "the occupation of the @xmath22 subspace becomes strongly suppressed and thus the commutation relations@xcite become @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and the effective completeness relation is @xmath25 .",
    "thus the electron operators , with the exclusion of the doubly occupied state , take the form @xmath26 , @xmath27 . by introducing the reference state @xmath28 and the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 we define @xmath31 and @xmath32 and thus the creation / annihilation operators can be written in terms of bosonic ( i.e. @xmath29 ) and quasi - fermionic ( i.e. @xmath30 ) operators@xcite as : @xmath33 , @xmath34 . within the slave boson representation",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath35 where the single occupation constraint is included by the lagrange multiplier @xmath36 which is fixed by the equation : @xmath37 while the slave boson operator @xmath29 evolves in time according to the equation of the motion @xmath38 $ ] , thus@xcite : @xmath39 we treat the slave boson operator @xmath29 within the mean field approximation ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and the original problem containing strong correlations is replaced by a constrained free - fermions - like theory whose dynamics is completely described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath42 with the dynamical constraints : @xmath43 as shown in ( 6 ) the interaction produces a renormalization of the qd energy level ( @xmath44 ) and a redefinition of the tunneling amplitudes ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this aspect is very important in the context of the quantum pumping .",
    "in fact , since the time evolution of the slave boson field is governed by the equation ( [ eq : b - dynamics ] ) , a dynamical phase shift with respect to the phase of the external driving signals is expected . within the adiabatic case , all the phases are rigidly related to the external driving signals , while at finite frequency this relation is lost and interesting contribution of hidden phases can emerge .",
    "in this section we employ the non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) formalism@xcite to derive the current flowing through the system when subject to an almost adiabatic quantum pumping ( small but finite pumping frequency @xmath3 ) in which we modulate the tunneling rates @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the density of states at the fermi level @xmath49 .",
    "+ due to the free - fermions like form of the hamiltonian the retarded gf of the quantum dot ( qd ) uncoupled from the external leads is ( @xmath50 ) : @xmath51 being @xmath52 the spin index . when the qd is coupled to the leads",
    ", we must take into account the transition rate of an electron through the system .",
    "the quantity encoding this information is the retarded self - energy which can be written within the wide band limit ( wbl ) as : @xmath53 and thus the retarded green s function of the qd coupled to the leads takes the form : @xmath54 which depends on the renormalized quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding advanced quantities , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are computed directly by using the general relation @xmath59 , @xmath60 being @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the langreth rules@xcite can be employed to compute the _ lesser _ self - energy as @xmath63 it is proportional to the fourier transform @xmath64 of the fermi function @xmath65 ( notice that the chemical potential is the same for both the leads ) .    in order to calculate the current flowing through the qd we need to calculate the _ lesser _ gf @xmath66 of the qd exploiting the keldysh equation@xcite and by using @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "together with the single particle green s function we need yet to solve the constraint equation .",

    "this aspect becomes evident considering the limiting case in which @xmath70 ( spin insensitive tunneling ) . solving ( [ eq : constraints - gf2 ] ) for @xmath71 and substituting into ( [ eq : constraints - gf1 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath72\\mathcal{b}(t)-i\\frac{\\gamma(t)}{2}|\\mathcal{b}(t)|^2\\mathcal{b}(t)+ ... ,\\ ] ] in which the nonlinear term @xmath73 accounting for the interacting nature of the problem appears .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath86 picks up a phase due to the external driving signals @xmath87 , the gf of the problem depends separately on @xmath88 and not via the phase difference @xmath89 .",
    "the last observation implies that the quantum state of the dot is affected by the precise external phases which couple the system and not only by the phase difference @xmath1 applied to the nanostructure .",
    "moreover , since the slave boson field is a complex quantity , @xmath90 , interference terms , i.e. of the form @xmath91 appears in @xmath92 .",
    "also additional phases associated to the constraint evolution appear .",
    "thus beyond the almost adiabatic limit , the existence of a great number of dynamical phases ( and the corresponding interference terms ) provides a decoherence source for the electron transport .",
    "the expression of the current pumped through the system can be calculated once the gf is determined .",
    "since it depends parametrically on @xmath93 one has first to solve the constraint equations . by exploiting the fourier expansions of eqs.([eq : constraints - gf1])-([eq : constraints - gf2 ] ) within the one - photon approximation",
    "we get the following set of constraints : @xmath94 and @xmath95 where the auxiliary functions @xmath96 involving the gfs of the qd are reported in the appendix [ app : fi - function ] . in principle",
    "the finite frequency problem gives us an infinite set of coupled constraints , while within the one photon approximation we obtain a reduced number of equations .",
    "however , from the numerical point of view , the solution of eqs.([eq : constr - gf - fourier1])-([eq : constr - gf - fourier2 ] ) may be in principle a non - trivial task since there can be numerical instabilities in the determination of the solution .",
    "when an almost adiabatic regime is considered ( retaining a finite frequency @xmath3 ) one considers the static constraints as perturbed by the remaining ones which on their turn can be treated by using some suitable approximations to be checked at the end of the computation .      in this subsection",
    "an approximate solution of the constraints shown in eqs.([eq : constr - gf - fourier1])-([eq : constr - gf - fourier2 ] ) is provided within the almost adiabatic case . from the analysis of the parametric expression of the current pumped through the system one can observe that the relevant quantities to be computed are : @xmath82 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . since we are modulating the tunneling amplitudes via top gates the contribution to the current coming from the modulation of @xmath56",
    "can be considered as a _ parasitic pumping effect _ whose intensity is very weak when @xmath100 .",
    "thus we need only to produce an approximate expression of @xmath101 and @xmath99 to the first order in @xmath102 .",
