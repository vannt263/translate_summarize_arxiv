    "thermoelectricity has recently received enormous attention due to the constant demand for new and powerful ways of energy conversion .",
    "increasing the efficiency of thermoelectric materials , in the whole range spanning from macro- to nano - scales , is one of the main challenges , of great importance for several different technological applications  @xcite .",
    "progress in understanding thermoelectricity at the nanoscale will have important applications for ultra - sensitive all - electric heat and energy transport detectors , energy transduction , heat rectifiers and refrigerators , just to mention a few examples .",
    "the search for optimisation of nano - scale heat engines and refrigerators has hence stimulated a large body of activity , recently reviewed by benenti _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    while most of the investigations have been carried out in two - terminal setups , thermoelectric transport in multi - terminal devices",
    "just begun to be investigated  @xcite since these more complex designs may offer additional advantages .",
    "an interesting perspective , for instance , is the possibility to exploit a third terminal to `` decouple '' the energy and charge flows and improve thermoelectric efficiency  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fundamental questions concerning thermodynamic bounds on the efficiency of these setups has been investigated@xcite , also accounting for the effects of a magnetic field breaking the time - reversal symmetry@xcite . in most of the cases",
    "studied so far , however , all but two - terminal were considered as mere probes ; i.e. no net flow of energy and charge through them was allowed .",
    "in other works a purely bosonic reservoir has been used , only exchanging energy ( and not charge ) current with the system  @xcite .",
    "is taken as the reference for measuring temperature and energy : @xmath0 ; @xmath1 .",
    "the reservoirs @xmath2 and @xmath3 have small variations in temperature and chemical potential : @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "with @xmath6 we denote a generic coherent scattering region.,width=264 ]    a genuine multi - terminal device will however offer enhanced flexibility and therefore it might be useful to improve thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "a full characterization of these systems is still lacking and motivates us to tackle this problem . here",
    "we focus on the simplest instance of three reservoirs , which can exchange both charge and energy current with the system .",
    "a sketch of the thermal machine is shown in fig.[fig : system ] , where three - terminal are kept at different temperatures and chemical potentials connected through a scattering region .",
    "our aim is to provide a general treatment of the linear response thermoelectric transport for this case , and for this purpose we will discuss local and non - local transport coefficients .",
    "note that non - local transport coefficients are naturally requested in a multi - terminal setup , since they connect temperature or voltage biases introduced between two - terminal to heat and charge transport among the remaining terminals .",
    "we will then show that the third terminal could be exploited to improve thermoelectric performance with respect to the two - terminal case .",
    "we will focus our investigations on the efficiency at maximum power  @xcite , i.e. of a heat engine operating under conditions where the output power is maximized . such quantity , central in the field of finite - time thermodynamics  @xcite , is of great fundamental and practical relevance to understand which systems offer the best trade - off between thermoelectric power and efficiency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:3terminals ]",
    "we briefly review the linear response , onsager formalism for a generic three - terminal setup . we will discuss the maximum output power and trace a derivation of all the local and non - local transport coefficients . in section  [ sec : efficiency ]",
    "we extend the concept of carnot bound at the maximum efficiency to the three - terminal setup and we derive analytical formulas of the efficiency at maximum power in various cases , depending on the flow of the heat currents .",
    "these expressions are written in terms of generalized dimensionless figures of merit .",
    "note that the expressions derived in section  [ sec:3terminals ] and  [ sec : efficiency ] are based on the properties of the onsager matrix and on the positivity of the entropy production .",
    "therefore they hold for non - interacting as well as interacting systems .",
    "this framework will then be applied in section  [ sec : models ] to specific examples of non - interacting systems in order to illustrate the salient physical picture .",
    "namely , we will consider a single quantum dot and two dots in series coupled to the three - terminal . finally section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the system depicted in fig .  [ fig : system ] is characterized by three energy and three particle currents ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively ) flowing from the corresponding reservoirs , which have to fulfill the constraints : @xmath9 ( positive values being associated with flows _ from _ the reservoir _ to _ the system ) . in what follows",
    "we will assume the reservoir 3 as a reference and the system to be operating in the linear response regime , i.e. set @xmath10 and write @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "under these assumptions the relation between currents and biases can then be expressed through the onsager matrix @xmath16 of elements @xmath17 via the identity : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the generalized forces , and where @xmath21 are the heat currents of the system , the corresponding currents to reservoir 3 being determined from @xmath22 and @xmath23 via the conservation laws of eq .",
    "( [ particle ] ) . in our analysis",
    "we take @xmath16 to be symmetric ( i.e. @xmath24 ) by enforcing time reversal symmetry in the problem .",
    "we also remind that , due to the positivity of the entropy production rate , such matrix has to be semi - positive definite ( i.e. @xmath25 ) and that it can be used to describe a two - terminal model connecting ( say ) reservoir 1 to reservoir 3 by setting @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .      for a two - terminal model",
    "the elements of the onsager matrix @xmath16 can be related to four quantities which gauge the transport properties of the system under certain constraints .",
    "specifically these are the electrical conductance @xmath28 and the peltier coefficient @xmath29 ( evaluated under the assumption that both reservoirs have the same temperature ) , and the thermal conductance @xmath30 and the thermopower ( or seebeck coefficient ) @xmath31 ( evaluated when no net charge current is flowing through the leads ) .",
    "when generalized to the multi - terminal model these quantities yield to the introduction of non - local coefficients , which describe how transport in a reservoir is influenced by a bias set between two other reservoirs .      for a two - terminal configuration",
    "the thermopower relates the voltage @xmath32 that develops between the reservoirs to their temperature difference @xmath33 under the assumption that no net charge current is flowing in the system , i.e. @xmath34 . a generalization of this quantity to the multi - terminal scenario can be obtained by introducing the matrix of elements @xmath35 with local ( @xmath36 ) and non - local ( @xmath37 ) coefficients , @xmath38 being the electron charge . in this definition , which does not require the control of the heat currents , we have imposed that the particle currents in all the leads are zero ( the voltages are measured at open circuits ) _ and _ that all but one temperature differences are zero ( of course this last condition is not required in a two - terminal model ) .",
    "it is worth observing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermopower ] ) differs from other definitions proposed in the literature .",
    "for example in ref .",
    "@xcite a generalization of the two - terminal thermopower to a three - terminal system , was proposed by setting to zero one voltage instead of the corresponding particle current . while operationally well defined",
    ", this choice does not allow one to easily recover the thermopower of the two - terminal case ( in our approach instead this is rather natural , see below ) .",
    "finally in the probe approach presented in refs .  @xcite it was possible to study a multi - terminal device by using an effective two - terminal system only , because the heat and particle currents of the probe terminals are set to vanish by definition . therefore , within this approach , there are no chances of having non - local transport coefficients .    in the three - terminal scenario",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ omatrix ] ) to rewrite the elements of the matrix  ( [ eq : thermopower ] ) . in particular introducing the quantities @xmath39 we get ( see  [ app : transport ] for details )",
    "@xmath40 which yields , correctly , @xmath41 as the only non - zero element , by taking the two - terminal limits detailed at the end of the previous section .      in a two - terminal configuration the electric conductance describes how the electric current depends upon the bias voltage between the two - terminal under isothermal conditions , i.e. @xmath42 . the generalization to many - terminal systems is provided by the following matrix : @xmath43 using the three - terminal onsager matrix  ( [ omatrix ] ) we find @xmath44 which , in the two - terminal limit where reservoir 2 is disconnected from the rest , gives @xmath45 as the only non - zero element .      the thermal conductance for a two - terminal is the coefficient which describes how the heat current depends upon the temperature imbalance @xmath33 under the assumption that no net charge current is flying through the system , i.e. @xmath46 . in the multi - terminal scenario",
    "this generalizes to @xmath47 where one imposes the same constraints as those used for the thermopower matrix  ( [ eq : thermopower ] ) , i.e. no currents and @xmath48 for all terminals but the @xmath27-th . for a three - terminal case , using eq .",
    "( [ defl2 ] ) this gives @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 once more , in the two - terminal limit where the reservoir 2 is disconnected from the rest , the only non - zero element is @xmath52 .      in a two - terminal configuration",
    "the peltier coefficient relates the heat current to the charge current under isothermal condition , i.e. @xmath53 . for multi - terminal systems this generalizes to the matrix @xmath54 which can be shown to be related to the thermopower matrix  ( [ eq : thermopower ] ) , through the onsager reciprocity equations , i.e. @xmath55 ( @xmath56 being the magnetic field on the system),@xcite from which , using eqs .",
    "( [ sloc ] ) and ( [ sloc1 ] ) , one can easily derive for the three - terminal case the dependence upon the onsager matrix @xmath16 .",

    ", we define the steady state heat to work conversion efficiency @xmath57 , for a three - terminal machine , as the power @xmath58 generated by the machine ( which equals to the sum of all the heat currents exchanged between the system and the reservoirs ) , divided by the sum of the heat currents _ absorbed _ by the system , i.e. @xmath59 where the symbol @xmath60 in the denominator indicates that the sum is restricted to positive heat currents only , and where in the last expression we used eq .",
    "( [ particle ] ) to express @xmath61 in terms of the other two independent currents@xcite .",
    "the definition ( [ eff ] ) applies only to the case in which @xmath62 is positive . since the signs of the heat currents",
    "@xmath63 are not known _ a priori _ ( they actually depend on the details of the system ) , the expression of the efficiency depends on which heat currents are positive .",
    "for the three - terminal system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] we set for simplicity @xmath64 and focus on those situations where @xmath65 is negative ( positive values of @xmath65 being associated with regimes where the machine effectively works as a refrigerator which extract heat from the coldest reservoir of the system ) . under these conditions",
    "the efficiency is equal to @xmath66 when both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are positive , or @xmath69 when for @xmath70 or @xmath3 only @xmath71 is positive .",
    "the carnot efficiency represents an upper bound for the efficiency and is obtained for an infinite - time ( carnot ) cycle . for a two - terminal thermal machine the carnot efficiency",
    "is obtained by simply imposing the condition of zero entropy production , namely @xmath72 . if the two reservoirs are kept at temperatures @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( with @xmath75 ) , from the definition of the efficiency , eq .",
    ", one gets the two - terminal carnot efficiency @xmath76 .",
    "the carnot efficiency for a three - terminal thermal machine is obtained analogously by imposing the condition of zero entropy production , when a reservoir at an intermediate temperature @xmath77 is added . if @xmath67 only is positive as in eq .",
    "( [ case1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : carnot3t_a ] ) is the sum of the two - terminal carnot efficiency @xmath80 and a term whose sign is determined by @xmath81 . since @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , it follows that @xmath85 is always _ reduced _ with respect to its two - terminal counterpart @xmath80 .",

    "we notice that this is a hybrid configuration ( not a heat engine , neither a refrigerator ) : the hottest reservoir absorbs heat , while the intermediate - temperature reservoir releases heat .",
    "however , the heat to work conversion efficiency is legitimately defined since generation of power ( @xmath91 ) can occur in this situation . finally , if both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are positive as in eq .",
    "( [ case2 ] ) one obtains @xmath92 since @xmath64 , the term that multiplies @xmath93 is positive so that @xmath94 is reduced with respect to the two - terminal case .",
    "it is worth noticing that , in contrast to the two - terminal case , the carnot efficiency can not be written in terms of the temperatures only , but it depends on the details of the system .",
    "moreover , note that the carnot efficiency is unchanged with respect of the two - terminal case if @xmath95 in ( [ eq : carnot3t_a ] ) or if @xmath96 in ( [ eq : carnot3t_b ] ) . indeed ,",
    "in this situation the quantities @xmath97 are equal to one , making the extra terms in eqs .   or to vanish .",
    "the above results for the carnot efficiency could be generalized to many - terminal systems . in particular",
    ", we conjecture that , given a system that works between @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( with @xmath75 ) and adding an arbitrary number of terminals at intermediate temperatures will in general lead to carnot bounds smaller than @xmath80 .",
    "on the other hand , adding terminals at higher ( or colder ) temperatures than @xmath73 and @xmath74 will make @xmath98 increase .",
    "notice that within linear response and via eq .",
    "( [ omatrix ] ) we can express the carnot efficiencies ( [ eq : carnot3t_a])-([eq : carnot3t_b ] ) in terms of the generalized forces @xmath99 .",
    "the efficiency at maximum power is the value of the efficiency evaluated at the values of chemical potentials that maximize the output power @xmath58 of the engine . in the two - terminal case the efficiency at maximum power",
    "can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a dimensionless figure of merit which depends upon the transfer coefficient of the system .",
    "the positivity of the entropy production imposes that such quantity should be non - negative ( i.e. @xmath102 ) , therefore @xmath103 is bounded to reach its maximum value @xmath104 only in the asymptotic limit of @xmath105 ( curzon - ahlborn limit  @xcite within linear response  @xcite ) .",
