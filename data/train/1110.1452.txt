    "infrared radiation from molecules and grains in space is usually or mostly attributed to heating by visible and uv light absorption .",
    "while this may be justified by the ubiquity of light radiation , it must be remembered that the ism ( interstellar medium ) is also permeated with atomic hydrogen .",
    "h atoms are also found in abundance in the limbs of molecular clouds illuminated by bright young stars ( pdrs or photodissociated regions ) .",
    "this paper accordingly explores the relative importance of deposition of energy by atomic hydrogen impacts on the same targets .",
    "as is well known , the formation of molecular hydrogen by two isolated h atoms is forbidden by energy and momentum conservation ; it is therefore associated instead with recombination in presence of a third body * ( see spitzer 1977 ) .",
    "the most readily available such body is a hydrocarbon molecule or grain .",
    "the latter is made of a carbon skeleton to which peripheral h atoms are attached .",
    "an incident h radical , if moderately energetic , will attract one of the h atoms at the grain periphery forcefully enough to capture it and form an h@xmath0 molecule which readily escapes into space ; this is called  h abstraction \" in surface physics language .",
    "it will be shown below that this process does not leave much energy in the grain .",
    "however , it does leave an unoccupied  dangling \" c - bond .",
    "when the next incident h atom meets that free bond , it is most likely to form a strong chemical bond with the host c atom .",
    "this  recombination \" deposits in the grain nearly 4 ev , * half of which is available in the form of kinetic energy to excite the vibrations of the hydrocarbon particle ( the other half going into potential energy ) .",
    "although this is no more energy than is carried by a visible photon , it is totally expendable in vibrational excitation , by contrast with photonic energy , which is first delivered to electrons , to relax thereafter into continuum and vibrational radiation .",
    "the emission of vibrational bands following h - impact excitation is a type of chemiluminescence . * the basics of this process",
    "were first put forward by guillois et al .",
    "it may be considered as a special case of the  radical reactions \" previously envisioned by allamandola and norman @xcite ; but these authors did not treat any process in particular , dwelling instead on relaxation times and emission probabilities . * * *    the present work is also motivated by several astronomical observations which hint at the need to complement the photon flux with another excitation agent for the emission of uibs ( unidentified infrared bands ) .",
    "one is the fact that the relative intensities of the bands in the spectrum of uibs do not change notably with the average photon energy of the ambient radiation ( uchida et al .",
    "1998 ) ; besides , neither the paucity of uv radiation ( as in galaxy m31 ; pagani et al . 1999 ) nor the absence of starbursts ( see haas et al .",
    "2002 ) precludes uib emission .",
    "another hint was the comparison , by onaka et al .",
    "@xcite , using the irts satellite , of uib emission ( 5 to 12 @xmath1 m ) at various galactic latitudes throughout the galaxy : the intensity of emission decreases quickly with increasing latitude , but its spectral profile remains unchanged . while there are no hot stars at these latitudes ( and therefore much less far uv photons ) , the uib intensity follows the trend of h atom density , which extends farther from the galactic plane than does molecular hydrogen density ( see imamura and sofue 1997 ) .",
    "earlier on , boulanger and prault @xcite , studying the solar environment by means of the iras satellite , found that , away from heating sources and molecular clouds , the ir emission from the cirruses of the ism is well correlated with the column density of hi gas .",
    "pagani et al .",
    "@xcite reached the same conclusion from the study of a large number of sight lines through the near - by andromeda nebula ; by contrast , they found no correlation of ir emission with uv flux .",
    "still another remarkable fact is the occurrence of the uib intensity peak , in pdrs ( photo - dissociation regions ) seen edge - on , in between the peak of recombination radiation ( signaled by h@xmath2 lines , e.g. br @xmath3 ) , on the star - illuminated side ( hii region ) , and the peak of h@xmath0 de - excitation radiation at 2.42 @xmath1 m .",
    "this is precisely where maximum atomic h density is to be found .",
    "the generic example is the orion bar ( see roche et al .",
    "1989 ) , sellgren et al .",
    "1990 , graham et al .",
    "1993 ) . * an idealized illustration of the succession of regions and of the distribution of densities and radiative fluxes was given by guillois et al .",
    "@xcite . *",
    "* finally , the need for some excitation process other than photon absorption to understand available observations seems to have been felt by other workers ; e.g. duley and williams @xcite reconsidered briefly another type of chemical excitation of ir vibration : the sudden and violent release , upon mild heating , of potential energy stored in molecules in the form of radicals . *    in sec .",
    "2 , i describe the elementary processes which create conditions under which h atom excitation becomes operational . in sec . 3 , rate equations coupling the relevant physical quantities are laid down and the statistical equilibrium values of the variables are determined .",
    "the latter are used in sec . 4 to determine the energy build up in a grain , under h atom bombardment .",
    "section 5 displays expressions for the uib reemission power . at this stage",
    ", it becomes possible to compare uv and h impact excitation of grains , which is done in sec .",
    "finally , sec . 7",
    "compares predictions of the chemiluminescence model with observations in various environments and measurements of different physical quantities .",
    "when an h atom ( radical ) impinges upon a hydrocarbon target , a number of processes may occur ( see lohmar et al .",
    "2009 , cazaux and tielens 2002 , papoular 2005 ) :    a)recoil ; this is usually nearly elastic , i.e. it involves little energy exchange .",
    "b)recoil with expulsion of an h atom off the target ; this breaking of a c - h bond requires an unusually energetic h projectile ( @xmath430 000 k ) .",
    "c)h abstraction , in which the incoming h atom is attracted by a target h atom to form a h@xmath0 molecule which readily leaves the target with a high velocity ; this leaves a dangling ( unoccupied ) c bond at the target surface , together with a fraction of the c - h bond energy .",
    "d)surface recombination of the h projectile with a target dangling bond ( chemisorption ) ; this may occur over a large range of projectile energies , and leaves the whole c - h bond energy in the target .",
    "\\e ) sticking ( physisorption ) of the incoming h atom at the target surface , over which it can wander until it goes through ( a ) , ( c ) or ( d ) .",
    "the steady state coverage of the target depends on all 5 processes but the energy balance is not the same for all , as shown below , * using version 7.5 of hyperchem , the chemical simulation code commercialized by hypercube , inc .",
    "earlier versions of this code were used and described in detail by , for instance , papoular @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here , i used the semi - empirical pm3 method of molecular dynamics calculation provided by the package .",
    "this method uses quantum - mechanical calculations , supported where necessary by empirical constants from the chemistry laboratory , which are kept up to date . in pm3 ,",
    "the empirical part was tailored by comparison with carbon - bearing molecules , so the energies given by this code agree with experiment to a few percent , better than necessary for present purposes . *",
    "first , the c - h bond energy was determined in several different structures .",
    "this was done by first optimizing the structure of interest ( at 0 k ) , i.e. minimizing its potential energy as a function of geometry , and measuring this energy .",
    "the h atom was then extracted and the new , higher , potential energy measured .",
    "the difference is the required bond energy , @xmath5 .    for h@xmath0 ,",
    "this is 109.4 kcal.mol@xmath6 . for an aliphatic chain ( -ch@xmath0-ch@xmath7 ) , @xmath5=98 ; in methyl ch@xmath8 , 101 to 106",
    "; in benzene , 116 to 118 , all in kcal.mol@xmath6 ( 1 ev=23 kcal.mol@xmath6 ) . * in the following , we take @xmath5=4 ev , uniformly , as higher accuracy is not warranted in describing the general properties of the present model . consider first case ( d ) .",
    "the target is assumed to be initially at rest at 0 k. in a simplified semi - classical picture , the representative point of this state is the bottom of a parabolic potential well * as in fig .",
    "1.when the incoming h atom is captured by a dangling bond , the potential well is suddenly depressed by @xmath5 , so the representative point is now found above the new bottom by the same quantity , with zero ke ( kinetic energy ) .",
    "it is compelled to slide down the well , rise on the other side , fall down again and repeat this sequence indefinitely . in this new , dynamic",
    ", state the average ke and pe ( potential energy ) are both equal to @xmath9 .",
    "this energy is initially localized in the new c - h bond in the form of large amplitude stretching vibrations , but it quickly spreads to other , closely coupled , vibrations of the structure * *    the average life time of this state before energy is lost through ir radiation is usually longer than 1 ms * ( see radzig and smirnov 1980 ) .",
    "so the posibility must be considered that , before this happens , another h radical is captured by the same target .",
    "the representative potential well will again be depressed .",
    "assume , for simplicity , that the transition to the new , third , state occurs at the moment when the representative point is at its peak height in the well with pe=@xmath5 and ke=0 .",
    "its instantaneous pe above the bottom of the new well will therefore be @xmath10 , and the average pe and ke will rise to @xmath5 .",
    "thus for each successive h recombination , the target particle gains @xmath11 ev in vibrational energy . if this energy were shared equally between , say n=100 atoms of the target , this would correspond to a * vibrational temperature of @xmath12170 k. * *    consider now case ( c ) . here , the gain in pe of the target upon loosing an h atom is partially compensated by the loss of pe associated with the formation of a h@xmath0 molecule , because the h bond energies involved are almost equal .",
    "moreover , the h@xmath0 molecule carries away vibrational , translational and rotational kinetic energies .",
    "typical values for an aliphatic chain , for instance , are , respectively , 19 , 15 and 0.3 kcal / mol for the h@xmath0 molecule , leaving only a few kcal / mol in the target .    for case ( b )",
    ", one can develop the same argument as for ( d ) , except that , here , the target potential well is suddenly raised , instead of depressed , upon losing an h radical .",
    "* assume , in fig .",
    "1 , that the system is given more energy than what is necessary to break a ch bond .",
    "after a while , half this extra gain in ( potential ) energy is converted into ke , as in case ( d ) . however",
    ", this process clearly requires an unusually energetic h projectile . *    in estimating the overall vibrational energy gain , below",
    ", we will therefore neglect the contributions of recoil and h absraction by comparison with that of h recombination .",
    "by hi region is meant , here , a region of space permeated with photons energetic enough to dissociate molecular hydrogen without ionizing the atoms .",
    "this excludes dense molecular clouds but includes , for instance , cirruses in the diffuse ism .",
    "let @xmath13 be the number densities ( @xmath14 ) of atomic , molecular and nuclear hydrogen , respectively , with @xmath15 .",
    "assume the average velocity of the h atoms is @xmath16 cm.s@xmath6 , and the flux of dissociating photons is @xmath17 @xmath18s@xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the number of c and h atoms in each hydrocarbon grain , and @xmath21 the number density of such grains ( @xmath14 ) . assume , for simplicity , that , in the ism , the mass ratio between grain and gas is 1/300 .",
    "ignoring heteroatoms , which are quite rare in fact , and h atoms which are much lighter , this implies @xmath22 , or @xmath23 .",
    "since we are interested in h recombination with naked c atoms ( those exhibiting a dangling bond ) at the grain surface , we have to distinguish between the naked and the  h - covered \" c atoms .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , for an aromatic and an aliphatic skeleton .    roughly speaking",
    ", a covered c atom may anchor one or two h atoms according to whether the skeleton is aromatic or aliphatic ; so there is 0.5 to 1 covered c atom for every bound h atom . taking 0.75 for simplicity , and assuming the carbon skeleton is not too compact ,",
    "we may therefore write @xmath24 on average . now , the relative numbers of covered and naked c atoms depend on the density of gaseous h atoms above the grain , and on the various c - s ( cross - sections ) of the gas - grain reactions . in statistical equilibrium ,",
    "the number of gaseous h atoms captured by a grain is equal to the number of bound h atoms liberated from the grain by h impact .",
    "this can be written    @xmath25    where @xmath26 are c - s s for recombination , abstraction and expulsion , respectively ; @xmath27 is the c - s for recombination after sticking (  indirect recombination \" ) ; a factor @xmath28 was omitted from each side as it is the same for all reactions , so this equilibrium is independent of the ambient gas density .",
    "then , defining @xmath29 , we get    @xmath30    and , hence ,    @xmath31 .",
    "the c - s s * involved in gas - grain interactions have been estimated , computed , modelled or measured ( see cazaux and tielens 2002 , * mennella et al .",
    "2002 , papoular 2005 , lohmar et al .",

    ", we read from papoular @xcite , with @xmath32 cm.s@xmath6 : @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "equation 2 then gives @xmath37 , indicating that the hydrogen coverage of the target is @xmath38 .",
    "* by way of comparison , in a study of gaseous atomic hydrogen interactions with carbon grains , papoular @xcite found that the h coverage of hydrocarbon grains varies between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , depending mainly on the kinetic temperature of the h gas . in a recent study of the hydrogenation of hac ( hydrogenated amorphous carbon ) duley and williams",
    "@xcite estimated the coverage at 0.3 - 0.5 . * * *    turning to the gas densities , let @xmath41 be the h@xmath0 molecule c - s for dissociation by photons .",
    "the rate equations for gaseous atomic and molecular hydrogen densities can be written    @xmath42    the terms in the r.h.s .",
    "of the first of these equations are for photodissociation , abstraction , recombination and expulsion respectively ; in the second line , the terms are for photodissociation and abstraction respectively . * in statistical equilibrium , the derivatives in the l.h.s . must be set to 0 .",
    "defining *    @xmath43 ,    * and using the second rate equation , *    @xmath44    * finally , using @xmath15 , we obtain *    @xmath45    note that , while @xmath46 depends only on c - s s , @xmath47 also depends on the radiative flux and on the velocity of h radicals .    as for the dissociating photon flux which enters the rate equations ,",
    "its value * varies considerably with the wavelength in the spectral region of interest ( lyman continuum , 900 - 1100   ) , and so does the dissociation rate @xmath48 ( see draine 1978 , fig . 3 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore usual to replace the latter by an estimated average value , @xmath49 , in this wavelength range .",
    "we adopt @xmath50 s@xmath6 for the galactic ism ( see stecher and williams 1979 , jura 1974 ) .",
    "nearer to hot stars , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the galactic fuv ( far ultra - violet ) flux , and @xmath53 may reach up to @xmath54 .",
    "we shall take @xmath55 , assuming that the * uv spectral profile does not change as the radiation varies in intensity .",
    "using these parameter values , eq .",
    "3 then becomes * *    @xmath56    thus , _ the ratio of molecules to atoms , z , is proportional to the total number density of h nuclei , and inversely proportional to the uv flux_.    this simplistic treatment neglects the extinction of dissociating light by molecules and grains along its path , as well as self - shielding of the h@xmath0 molecules against uv due to their excitation out of their ground level ( see draine and bertoldi 1996 , fig . 8) .",
    "when these effects are included , it is found that , for given density and radiation flux , the light is almost unaffected up to a critical column density , beyond which it is quickly extinguished while the molecular fraction increases steeply .",
    "the elaborate theory helps understanding the earlier observations of molecular cloud limbs ( see savage et al .",

    "the fortunate conclusion for our present purposes is that our treatment is acceptable below the critical column density , i.e. in most environments from which the uibs are usually observed to originate : cirruses , molecular limbs and pdrs .",
    "assuming the frequency of collisions between grains to be much lower than the frequency of h impacts on a particle , the energy deposited by the latter accumulates in the particle until it is reemitted in the form of ir radiation , which is its sole outlet .",

    "for a direct comparison with observations , the total uib emission per unit volume and time is needed . assume that all the chemical energy carried by the impinging h atoms is converted into ir emission .",
    "but , for the grains to distinctly emit the uibs , they must be * neither too small ( in which case , they could not contain all the functional groups that carry the uibs ) , nor too large ( in which case most of the energy would go into the continuum ) : this is demonstrated by emittance mesurements on carbonaceous particles of different compositions and sizes ( see , for instance , solomon et al .",

    "equation 8 clearly shows that this depends on whether @xmath47 is much larger or much smaller than 1/2 .",

    "thus , _ in small fuv fluxes , indirect heating by h atom impacts is much more efficient than radiative heating , independent of @xmath53 ; this is essentially because there are so many fast hydrogen atoms that their flux is larger than that of fuv photons .",
    "but , in high fuv fluxes , hydrogen is almost totally dissociated , so @xmath94 decreases because , as @xmath53 increases , @xmath90 no longer increases while radiative heating still increases and ultimately becomes dominant .",
    "_ this conclusion holds even if some less energetic photons ( 1100 to 2400 @xmath95 ) are included ; it is even strengthened when it is recalled that photon absorption is intrinsically less efficient than h impact in producing uib emission , as some of its energy is diverted into ionization and another part into continuum emission .",
    "the ratio ( 15 ) can be slightly modified to become the ratio of total uib emission to total ir emission . to that effect ,",
    "assume , as in sec . 5",
    ", that total conversion of the chemical energy into uib emission occurs only in a fraction @xmath71 , in mass , of the carbonaceous grains .",

    ", the grain efficiency in exciting uibs must be a decreasing function of grain size , so the transition between uib - emitting and non - uib - emitting must be gradual rather than a sharp cut - off .",
    "pagani et al .",
    "@xcite made a similar study of the diffuse ism of the andromeda nebula , m 31 .",
    "they considered the signal from the lw2 ( 5 - 8 @xmath1 m ) filter of isocam on board the iso satellite as a tracer of uibs and found that _ it is extremely well correlated , across the galaxy , with the distribution of neutral gas as mapped by the hi ( 21 cm radio ) and co(1 - 0 ) signals ( @xmath65 in our model ) , which they also plotted .",
    "by contrast , the correlation is poor with the ionized gas as seen through its h@xmath3 emission , and non - existent with the uv emission_. they conclude that the mid - ir emission can be excited by the ambient visible and near - ir radiation .",

    "the difference between @xmath214 and @xmath215 is a measure of the patchiness of the diffuse ism .",
    "a model was developed for the excitation of the uibs by h atom impacts in the interstellar medium .",
    "it builds upon the fact that , in the presence of far uv radiation and hydrocarbon grains , the hydrogen gas will be partially dissociated and the grain surface will be partially hydrogenated and partially covered with free carbon bonds . under such a statistical equilibrium , h atoms from the gas will recombine with c atoms at the grain surface at some rate . at each recombination , the h atom deposits an energy of about 5 ev in the grain .",
    "half of this is directly converted into vibrational excitation , always distributed in the same way among the most tightly coupled vibration modes of the grain .",
    "absent frequent grain - grain collisions , the only outlet for this energy is ir reemission , part of it in the uibs , provided the chemical structure of the grains is adequate , and the other part in the continuum .",
    "the partition only depends upon the grain size , all grains being assumed to have the same constitution .",
    "only a fraction , @xmath216 , of the grains ( the smallest ones ) will contribute significantly to the uibs .",
    "it is shown quantitatively that h impacts are generally more efficient excitation agents than uv absorption because of the overwhelming abundance of hydrogen relative to uv photons . only very near young bright stars",
    "is this no longer true because photon flux then largely exceeds h atom flux . thus h impacts and fuv absorption are both necessary to understand the variety of observed uib * spectral intensities . *",
    "the model translates into a small number of equations enabling a quantitative comparison of its predictions with available astronomical observations , which have become exquisitely rich and accurate in the last two decades .",
    "section 7 collects some of the most crucial tests of the model :    - it predicts uib emission even far from star bursts and in poor - fuv environments .    -",
    "since the excitation agent and the deposited energy are always the same , uib reemission is independent of the temperature of the neighbouring illuminating stars .    - in pdrs , it becomes possible to understand the observed very near spatial coincidence of hi and h@xmath123 emission with the peak of the uibs .",

    "the most restrictive one is the neglect of uv extinction and self - shielding of hydrogen ; the calculations are progressively invalidated as column densities along the sight lines exceed a few times 10@xmath218 @xmath18 .",

    "as the heating is proportional to the c - h recombination c - s ( eq . 8) , the latter needs measurement or at least confirmation by other means .",
    "it was also assumed that the importance of the dissociating uv flux relative to total uv does not depend on the total uv flux ; this only impacts the degree of dissociation of hydrogen , and most of our calculations are weakly sensitive to it .",
    "none of these assumptions notably affects the general nature and performance of this model .    the notion of a fraction",
    "@xmath71 should not be taken to correspond to definite lower and upper size limits ; for the transition between emitting and non - emitting grains is progressive and likely to depend on grain structure and composition .",
    "some of the physical processes involved here are evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations . even for a 100-atom molecule ,",
    "an important broadening mechanism is already at work and directly observable in chemical simulations : this is the interaction between modes and constant redistribution , between them , of the initially deposited energy .",
    "this widens lines into bands and confers wings to each line , so ",
    "plateaus \" appear below  bands \" in crowded spectral regions , and even an underlying continuum is visible ( see papoular 2000 ) .",
    "this effect is observed to increase quickly with the size , much more so than the number of modes .    as the grain size increases , the number of skeletal vibration modes ( involving the whole structure ) increases more rapidly than the number of modes of functional groups ( involving only a small number of atoms of adequate chemical nature , and with adequate bonds to other atoms ) .",
    "the uibs are mainly due to the latter , while the continuum ( mainly in the farther ir ) is due to the former .",
    "thus , the fraction of energy deposited in the grain that goes into uib emission progressively decreases as the size increases .",
    "this is observed up to the largest structures attainable by the usual simulations ( of order of 10@xmath219 atoms ) .",
    "tailoring the composition and structure of the grains so that they carry the uibs is outside the scope of this paper ( it was treated at length by papoular 2011 ) .",
    "the validity of our conclusions do not depend on these properties , provided the grains bear enough carbon dangling bonds at their periphery , in steady state , so they can capture ambient h atoms .",

    "<S> a model was developed for the excitation of the uibs by h atom impacts in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> it builds upon the fact that , in the presence of far uv radiation and hydrocarbon grains , the hydrogen gas will be partially dissociated and the grain surface will be partially hydrogenated and partially covered with free carbon bonds . under such a statistical equilibrium , h atoms from the gas will recombine with c atoms at the grain surface at some rate . at each recombination , the h atom deposits an energy of about 5 ev in the grain . </S>",
    "<S> half of this is directly converted into vibrational excitation , always distributed in the same way among the most tightly coupled vibration modes of the grain . </S>",
    "<S> absent frequent grain - grain collisions , the only outlet for this energy is ir reemission , part of it in the uibs , provided the chemical structure of the grains is adequate , and the other part in the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the partition only depends upon the grain size , all grains being assumed to have the same constitution . only a fraction , about 0.25 , of the grains ( among the smallest ones ) will contribute significantly to the uibs .    </S>",
    "<S> it is shown quantitatively that h impacts are generally more efficient excitation agents than uv absorption because of the overwhelming abundance of hydrogen relative to uv photons . </S>",
    "<S> only very close to young bright stars is this no longer true because photon flux then largely exceeds h atom flux . </S>",
    "<S> thus h impacts and fuv absorption are both necessary to understand the variety of observed uib spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the model translates into a small number of equations enabling a quantitative comparison of its predictions with available astronomical observations , which have become exquisitely rich and accurate in the last two decades .    </S>",
