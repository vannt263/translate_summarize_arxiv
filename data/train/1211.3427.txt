    "it is now well established that there exists a cosmic star - to - star dispersion in the abundances of the heavy elements barium and strontium in halo field stars .",
    "early hints of this effect appeared in the work of @xcite and @xcite , and subsequent work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others confirmed and extended it to stars with metallicities 10,000 times lower than the sun .",
    "these studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the dispersion can not be a consequence of uncertainties in the abundance analysis techniques or other observational error .",
    "the lighter elements show more constant ratios with dispersions mostly consistent with observational error only ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the contrast between the light ( e.g. , magnesium ) and heavy elements ( e.g. , strontium , barium , or europium ) is apparent in the small dispersion of [ mg / fe ] ratios and the large dispersion of [ eu / fe ] ratios at low metallicity , as shown by figure  14 in @xcite .",
    "many surveys , including those of @xcite , @xcite , beers , preston , & shectman ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , and the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration @xcite have been conducted to identify fgk - type stars that contain weak absorption lines from metals such as calcium or iron .",
    "presumably such stars are among the oldest low - mass stars in the universe , but to date no star has been found to be lacking magnesium , calcium , or iron .",
    "the elements heavier than the iron group ( @xmath1  30 or so ) are thought to be produced in different ways than the lighter elements are , likely by neutron - capture or charged - particle reactions .",
    "but , like the lighter elements , are the heavy ones always present ?    the purpose of this paper is to examine the stellar abundance data available in the literature to consider whether any stars are currently known that may be considered probable candidates for lacking elements heavier than the iron group altogether .",
    "the specific nucleosynthetic origins of these elements are no doubt interesting , but instead i will focus on the more general question of detectability . @xcite considered how often sr  ii or ba  ii lines had been detected in one large snapshot survey of metal - poor stars , that of @xcite , who studied 253  stars .",
    "for the 34  coolest stars in their sample , those with @xmath2  4800  k , sr  ii and ba  ii lines were detected in every one . in this paper ,",
    "i reexamine this question by considering an expanded sample of field , globular cluster , and dwarf galaxy stars .",
    "i adopt the standard definition of elemental ratios throughout this work . for elements",
    "x and y , the logarithmic abundance ratio relative to the solar ratio is defined as [ x / y ]  @xmath3 .",
    "these ratios always indicate the total elemental abundance after ionization corrections have been applied . for stellar metallicity",
    ", i adopt the iron abundance as derived from fe  ii lines , when available , and otherwise i resort to the [ fe / h ] values reported in the literature .",
    "strontium ( sr , @xmath4  38 ) and barium ( ba , @xmath4  56 ) are the two elements heavier than the iron group best - suited for this investigation .",
    "sr  ii and ba  ii are the dominant species of these elements in late - type stellar atmospheres because of their low first ionization potentials , 5.69 and 5.21  ev , respectively .",
    "both elements are members of the alkaline earth metals along with magnesium ( mg , @xmath4  12 ) and calcium ( ca , @xmath4  20 ) .",
    "these ions all have a single valence s electron in the ground state .",
    "the first excited p state has @xmath5  3/2 or 1/2 , giving rise to a strong resonance doublet feature .",
    "these transitions correspond to the well - known mg  ii doublet at 2795 and 2802   ( connecting the 2p@xmath63s @xmath7s@xmath8 and 2p@xmath63p @xmath7p@xmath9 terms ) and the ca  ii doublet at 3933 and 3968(3p@xmath64s @xmath7s@xmath8 to 3p@xmath64p @xmath7p@xmath9 ) .",
    "these absorption lines frequently rank among the strongest lines observed in late - type stars and galaxies whose integrated light is dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "the sr  ii doublet at 4077 and 4215   ( 4p@xmath65s @xmath7s@xmath8 to 4p@xmath65p @xmath7p@xmath9 ) and the ba  ii doublet at 4554 and 4934(5p@xmath66s @xmath7s@xmath8 to 5p@xmath66p @xmath7p@xmath9 ) are their analogs . since strontium and barium frequently rank among the more abundant elements heavier than the iron group , these spectral lines are the most readily available heavy element transitions in the optical , near ultraviolet , and near infrared regions of stellar spectra .",
    "the proportionally large abundance of barium makes it a better choice for comparison than europium ( @xmath4  63 ) .",
    "europium is commonly used as a tracer of nucleosynthesis by the rapid neutron - capture process ( ) . a large fraction of its solar system abundance ( @xmath10  91% ; e.g. , @xcite ) is attributed to  nucleosynthesis . in the solar system",
    ", barium is @xmath11  46  times more abundant than europium . in metal - poor halo stars strongly enriched by  material , like",
    ", barium is approximately nine times more abundant than europium @xcite .",
    "metal - poor stars with a deficiency of elements heavier than barium , like , have similar ratios of barium to europium , @xmath11  1015 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "metal - poor stars highly enriched by material produced by slow neutron - capture reactions ( the ) frequently show barium to europium ratios of several hundred or more ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "barium is always considerably more abundant than europium , so it should be detectable more often than europium if the abundances of both elements are low .    in most metal - poor stars ,",
    "the [ ba / eu ] ratio is low and close to the ratios found in and ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that even the barium in these stars owes its origin mainly to some kind of  nucleosynthesis .",
    "the strontium may owe its origins to several mechanisms in addition to  nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "i emphasize that the results of the present study do not require that either of these interpretations holds true .",
    "i have compiled a sample of 1148  field stars and 226  stars in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) or ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) galaxies from the literature with reported detections or upper limits on the strontium or barium abundance . of these , 728 ( 39 )",
    "field ( dsph and ufd ) stars have reported detections or upper limits for both strontium and barium , 318 ( 187 ) stars have reported detections or upper limits for barium only , and 102 ( 0 ) stars have reported detections or upper limits for strontium only .",
    "a total of 707 ( 69 ) of these stars have [ fe / h ]  @xmath02.0 .",
    "the majority of the field stars in this compilation were originally identified as having weak metal lines in the spectroscopic surveys listed in section  [ intro ] or as high proper motion stars in the surveys of giclas , burnham , & thomas ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all of the abundances considered have been derived from spectra with moderately high resolution ( @xmath12  15,000 or better ) .",
    "the complete list of 54  studies of field stars and 23  studies of dsph and ufd galaxy stars is given in the caption to figure  [ srbaplot ] .",
    "additional comments on a few stars can be found in appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "this compilation is surely not complete for the highest metallicities or for stars with high levels of heavy elements .",
    "for example , stars strongly enriched by the  or are underrepresented .",
    "these are not the stars of interest here .",
    "sr  ii and ba  ii lines are always easily detectable in these stars , and the lines are often saturated .",
    "figure  [ srbaplot ] illustrates the [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] ratios found in this sample of stars .",
    "both detections and upper limits are included , although not all studies report upper limits for non - detections .",
    "the upper limits cited in the literature are frequently , but not always , 3@xmath13 upper limits .",
    "strontium and barium abundances have not always been reported together , however , so figures  [ srplot ] and [ baplot ] display the [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "i have made no attempt to correct these literature values to a common  or solar abundance scale or to standardize for different treatments of the van der waals damping constants , @xmath14 .",
    "the transition probabilities of these lines are each well known to excellent accuracy . for example",
    ", the nist atomic spectral database @xcite grades their accuracy at 10% ( 0.04  dex ) or better , and the variations in the  values adopted in the stellar abundance literature generally mirror this .",
    "differences in the accepted solar abundances of these elements are also small , varying by @xmath15  0.05  dex among frequently - cited reviews @xcite . such differences are negligible for our purposes .    for consistency ,",
    "all abundances considered in this study are based on one - dimensional model atmospheres assuming that local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) holds .",
    "sr  ii and ba  ii are the dominant species in the line - forming layers of fgk - type stars , so small departures from saha ionization equilibrium will have little impact on the derived abundances .",
    "the resonance lines of sr  ii and ba  ii may be driven out of lte population equilibrium ( non - lte ) by underpopulating the lower levels and overpopulating the upper levels relative to their lte boltzmann equilibria . both sr  ii and ba  ii behave similarly because of their similar electronic structures .",
    "such departures are predicted to have a moderate impact on the derived abundances , and they are dependent on a variety of factors including the temperature , gravity , [ sr / h ] or [ ba / h ] , and the collisional cross sections for hydrogen and electrons . at low metallicity , for a given [ sr / h ] or",
    "[ ba / h ] the resonance line profile calculated under non - lte conditions is weaker than that calculated assuming lte .",
    "abundance differences up to @xmath160.3  dex or @xmath160.4  dex are predicted when calculated assuming non - lte relative to the lte case for most of the temperature and abundance ranges of interest here @xcite .",
    "while these differences certainly are not negligible , for low [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] they will generally raise the abundances and detection thresholds ( section  [ detection ] ) together .",
    "this offset does not affect the conclusions of the present study .",
    "i have computed approximate thresholds for detecting the stronger of the two resonance lines of each species , sr  ii 4077  and ba  ii 4554 , in representative model atmospheres ranging from cool giants (  @xmath17  4500  k ,  @xmath17  0.5 , and  @xmath17  2.0  ) , to stars on the lower giant branch (  @xmath17  5500  k ,  @xmath17  3.5 , and  @xmath17  1.5  ) , to warm turn - off stars (  @xmath17  6400  k ,  @xmath17  4.0 , and  @xmath17  1.3  ) .",
    "these calculations are made using models interpolated from the @xmath18-enhanced grid of atlas9 model atmospheres @xcite and the latest version of the analysis code moog @xcite with updates described in @xcite .",
    "the overall metallicity of the model has little effect ( @xmath19  0.07  dex ) on the calculated limits of [ sr / h ] or [ ba / h ] .",
    "the continuous opacity is lower in cooler giants than in warm turn - off stars , so absorption lines will be easier to detect in cooler stars for a constant [ sr / h ] or [ ba / h ] . in warmer stars , the threshold levels increase .",
    "for example , the 3m  detection threshold for the sr  ii 4077  line in the model with  @xmath17  4500  k is [ sr / h ]  @xmath206.2 . in the model with  @xmath17  5500  k , the same 3m  detection threshold is [ sr / h ]  @xmath204.5 , while in the model with  @xmath17  6400  k it is [ sr / h ]  @xmath203.8 .",
    "similarly , the 3m  detection threshold for the ba  ii 4554  line in the model with  @xmath17  4500  k is [ ba / h ]  @xmath206.0 . in the model with  @xmath17  5500  k",
    "it is [ ba / h ]  @xmath204.3 , while in the model with  @xmath17  6400  k it is [ ba / h ]  @xmath203.5 .",
    "the 10m , 3m , and 1mdetection thresholds for cool giants are illustrated by three sets of lines in figures  [ srbaplot][baplot ] .",
    "these represent the lowest levels of strontium or barium that could be detected under favorable circumstances .",
    "the ba  ii 4554  line is broadened by the energy level shifts from different isotopes of barium , and the levels of the two naturally - occurring odd-@xmath21 isotopes are further broadened by hyperfine splittings . for weak lines on the linear portion of the curve of growth , neglecting this effect has no significant impact on the derived abundances .",
    "this is illustrated by the low barium abundance cases in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "heavy element abundance trends in globular cluster stars generally reflect the patterns in field stars at comparable metallicities .",
    "globular clusters belonging to the milky way and its system of dwarf galaxies all have mean metallicities [ fe / h ]  @xmath222.6 or so . at these metallicities ,",
    "the highly - enriched and highly - deficient extremes of neutron - capture enrichment found in more metal - poor galactic halo stars are generally muted in both field stars and globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "heavy elements are not always studied in late - type stars in globular clusters . in studies using modern instrumentation ( since about 1990 ) , no upper limits have been published indicating any element , x , heavier than the iron group has [ x / fe ]  @xmath01 in globular clusters ( see , e.g. , the compilation by @xcite ) .",
    "some clusters show an internal star - to - star dispersion in [ x / h ] or [ x / fe ] , but they are always present ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the heavy elements are detected even in extreme outer halo clusters that reside at great distances , like pal  3 , pal  4 , pal  14 , or @xcite .",
    "stars in globular clusters associated with the sagittarius ( e.g. , @xcite ) and fornax @xcite dwarf galaxies consistently show the presence of heavy elements , as do those associated with the the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "there appear to be no globular cluster environments that were lacking in the elements heavier than the iron group when the present - day stars were forming .",
    "since these elements are always found in @xmath23  solar ratios in globular clusters , they are not shown in the figures .",
    "figure  [ srbaplot ] shows the [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] ratios in metal - poor field stars and dwarf galaxies , and figures  [ srplot ] and [ baplot ] show the [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "these figures reveal that the number of stars where strontium and barium are examined but not detected ( i.e. , upper limits are reported ) constitute only a small fraction of all metal - poor stars that have been studied .",
    "figures  [ srplot ] and [ baplot ] demonstrate that many stars show subsolar [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] ratios at metallicities below [ fe / h ]  @xmath242.5 .",
    "this , of course , has been found repeatedly by many of the studies whose results are incorporated into the present sample .",
    "the stars of most interest for this study are those in the lower left corner of figure  [ srbaplot ] with the lowest [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] ratios . at present , there are no upper limits on [ sr / h ] or [ ba / h ] for field stars that are lower than the lowest levels of detection . ,",
    "studied by @xcite , shows detectable sr  ii and ba  ii lines and a [ sr / h ] ratio ( @xmath255.99  @xmath19  0.15 ) lower than any other stars studied at present .",
    "sr  ii and ba  ii lines are also detected in , also studied by @xcite , which has a [ ba / h ] ratio ( @xmath255.80  @xmath19  0.15 ) lower than any other stars studied at present .",
    "both of these stars are extremely cool ( 4400  k ) , facilitating the detection of these weak lines .    in the dwarf galaxy sample , there are two stars with upper limits on [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] that are almost as low as the lowest detections in field stars , star  119 in draco @xcite and star  1020549 in sculptor @xcite .",
    "four field stars , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show detectable sr  ii and ba  ii lines and [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] ratios comparable to the lower limits found in the two dwarf galaxy stars .",
    "these stars can all be found in the lower left corner of figure  [ srbaplot ] with [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ]  @xmath245.5  @xmath19  0.3 .",
    "several independent investigations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have detected sr  ii and ba  ii lines in numerous other stars in sculptor ( @xmath2611.1 ) , including one star with [ fe / h ]  @xmath244.0 @xcite .",
    "draco ( @xmath268.8 ) is not completely devoid of heavy elements , either ; @xcite and @xcite have detected sr  ii and ba  ii lines in other stars in draco .",
    "stars  2 and 3 in hercules ( @xmath266.6 ) show low upper limits , [ ba / h ]  @xmath04.2 ( [ ba / fe ]  @xmath02.1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "sr  ii and ba  ii lines have been detected in other stars in hercules ( @xcite ; a.  koch , 2012 , private communication ) , so hercules is also not completely lacking heavy elements .",
    "@xcite point out that a galaxy like draco is luminous enough to have possibly been assembled from several `` first '' galaxies , some of which may not have experienced any enrichment of elements heavier than the iron group .",
    "such galaxies are not found among the surviving ufd galaxies whose chemistry has been studied . with the exception of ba  ii in segue  1 , sr  ii and ba  ii lines have been detected in giants in each of the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies studied , leo  iv ( @xmath265.8 ) , ursa major  ii ( @xmath264.2 ) , coma berenices ( @xmath264.1 ) , and segue  1 ( @xmath261.5 ) @xcite .",
    "all galaxies examined to date show the presence of heavy elements .",
    "both sr  ii resonance lines have been detected in the most iron - poor star known , @xcite .",
    "the three other known iron - poor stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath04.5 yield only upper limits on [ sr / h ] , but these upper limits are all significantly lower than the [ sr / h ] ratio found in .",
    "this cosmic dispersion at the lowest levels of [ fe / h ] was first pointed out by @xcite when less data were available , and it still holds true with current data .",
    "the [ sr / h ] limits in @xcite and @xcite are among the lowest found for any star , with the exception of as noted above .",
    "the [ sr / h ] upper limit given by @xcite for , [ sr / h ]  @xmath05.1 , is a factor of a few higher than these stars .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of sr  ii lines in indicates that at least one mechanism to produce elements heavier than the iron group can operate at the extremely low metallicities of the stars that enriched the most iron - poor stars .",
    "ba  ii lines have not been detected in any of these stars , and the present upper limits are not low enough to be of great interest .",
    "neutron - capture reactions are the only known mechanisms for production of elements heavier than the second neutron - capture peaks ( 130  @xmath27  140 ) .",
    "charged particle reactions may be able to produce elements near the first peaks , like strontium , but they are unable to produce elements at or beyond the second peaks , including barium , as shown by the calculations of , e.g. , @xcite . the presence of barium and any heavier elements , including europium , indicates the operation of some kind of neutron - capture reaction .",
    "although the abundances of strontium and barium are considerably lower in halo stars than the abundances of lighter elements like magnesium , calcium , or iron , the current data indicate that these heavy elements may be found in nearly every star .",
    "this raises the intriguing prospect that at least one kind of neutron - capture reaction operates as frequently as the nucleosynthesis mechanisms that produce the lighter elements in the early universe .",
    "the yields of the heavy elements must certainly be variable and decoupled from the production of magnesium and iron to explain the observed small dispersion in [ mg / fe ] and large dispersion in [ eu / fe ] .",
    "the mass ranges of the supernovae that provide this enrichment must also play an important role , since there is evidence that some stars may have been enriched by very few or just one massive supernova ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "detailed chemical evolution models to test this scenario are beyond the goals of the present study .",
    "the detection thresholds indicate that , in principle , there is still room for improvement in constraining the upper limits on [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] in cool giants . using the relationships between the equivalent width ,",
    "signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , and spectrograph parameters given by @xcite or @xcite , it is possible to quantify how much improvement could be expected .",
    "the workhorse high - resolution echelle spectrographs on the largest optical telescopes are mike on the magellan - clay telescope @xcite , uves on the very large telescope @xcite , hrs on the hobby - eberly telescope @xcite , hds on the subaru telescope @xcite , and hires on the keck  i telescope @xcite . for standard high - resolution settings ( @xmath28  30,000 to 50,000 ) on these instruments , 3@xmath13 upper limits at s / n  @xmath23  50 pixel@xmath29 are approximately 3m  to 5mat the sr  ii and ba  ii resonance lines .",
    "obtaining spectra of this quality of cool giants in distant dwarf galaxies is challenging since segue  1 , ursa major  ii , coma berenices , draco , hercules and leo  iv are located at distances of 23  @xmath19  2  kpc @xcite , 30  @xmath19  5  kpc @xcite , 44  @xmath19  4  kpc @xcite , 76  @xmath19  6  kpc @xcite , 132  @xmath19  12  kpc @xcite , and 154  @xmath19  5  kpc @xcite , respectively . for example",

    "additional higher - excitation lines of ba  ii are found at redder wavelengths ( 5853 , 6141 , and 6496 ) .",
    "these lines are intrinsically weaker than the resonance ba  ii lines in cool stars , but they are useful because of the increased stellar flux and s / n attainable at these wavelengths in comparable exposure times . some of the results shown in figure  [ baplot ] ( e.g. , stars in the hercules dwarf ; @xcite ) are derived from these lines",
    ".    fortunately , many of the field giants shown in figures  [ srbaplot][baplot ] are within @xmath11  10  kpc of the sun , so high s / n ratios in the blue spectral region are attainable . with deliberate effort to achieve higher s / n ratios in the blue ( 50100 pixel@xmath29 ) ,",
    "levels of strontium and barium lower by factors of two to three could be detected .",
    "should giants exist with even lower [ sr / h ] or [ ba / h ] ratios , the present suite of spectrographs on 610  m class telescopes is capable of identifying them .",
    "the main result of this study is that no metal - poor stars have yet been found with sufficiently low limits on [ sr / h ] or [ ba / h ] to suggest their birth environment had not been enriched by elements heavier than the iron group .",
    "sr  ii and ba  ii lines are always detected in cool globular cluster and field stars when studied with high - quality observations .",
    "a few stars in some of the low - luminosity dwarf galaxies may have been born in the regions most lacking in heavy elements , but strontium and barium have been detected in at least a few stars in all dwarf galaxies yet studied .",
    "the identification of stars with unusually low [ sr / h ] or [ ba / h ] would , of course , be of great interest .",
    "current upper limits can be improved by observational campaigns dedicated to improving the s / n ratios at the blue wavelengths where the sr  ii and ba  ii resonance lines are found . in cool giants , upper limits on [ sr / h ] and [ ba / h ] that are better by factors of two to three are attainable with current instruments .",
    "one goal moving forward is to test whether all regions where low - mass stars formed in and around the halo of the milky way have experienced at least minimal amounts of enrichment with elements heavier than the iron group .",
    "whatever the outcome , this will have profound implications for characterizing the frequency and environmental influence of the astrophysical sites of heavy element production .    the lively discussion among the participants of the nuclei in the cosmos xii satellite workshop on  nucleosynthesis and j.  cowan s insightful questions served as my inspiration for writing this paper .",
