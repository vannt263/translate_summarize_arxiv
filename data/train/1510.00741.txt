    "the identification and investigation of _ nearby young moving groups _ ( nymgs )  i.e. , loose associations of stars that lie within @xmath0100 pc of earth and have ages up to @xmath0100 myr  arguably began with the identification of the late - type , emission - line field star tw hydrae as a `` t tauri star far from any dark cloud '' .",
    "this comprehensive study by rucinski & krautter establishing the classical t tauri nature of tw hya was motivated by the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henize ( 1976 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* herbig ( 1978 ) ) , and led directly to the identification of additional examples of `` isolated t tauri stars '' ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ( de la reza et al .  1989 ; gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "these studies yielded the identification of a literal handful of late - type field stars with t tauri - like characteristics  in particular , deep li absorption and apparent mid - infrared excesses and li , and hence identified as young , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de la reza et al .  ( 1989 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gregorio - hetem et al .  ( 1992 ) ) thanks to chance alignments with ir - bright background galaxies . ]",
    " in the general vicinity of tw hya .    in their landmark paper , ( * ?",
    "* de la reza et al .  ( 1989 ) ) speculated on the potential nature of these lonely t tauri stars , suggesting they were `` kinematically related '' and likely formed _ in situ_. furthermore , on the basis of these stars high galactic latitudes , de la reza et al .  suggested ( without assigning a specific distance range ) that tw hya and its apparent cohort may be relatively close to earth .",
    "the last assertion seemed particularly intriguing , given the potential for `` close - up '' studies of planetary systems in formation that might be afforded by these and other `` isolated '' t tauri stars .",
    "following up on this hunch , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zuckerman et al .  ( 1995 ) ) established that the thermal infrared excess from dust around tw hya ( and a few other `` isolated , '' young , ir - excess stars ) was accompanied by the presence of residual orbiting molecular ( co ) gas , suggestive of the recent cessation of an epoch of planet formation .",
    "but the distance and age of tw hya remained very poorly constrained .    with the release of the rosat ( x - ray ) all - sky survey ( rass )",
    ", we could address these unknowns .",
    "the rass x - ray data firmly established the youth of tw hya and its ( four ) nearby siblings , yet also suggested the five were older than typical of t tauri stars in dark clouds ; we guesstimated ( sic ) the ages of the five stars as @xmath020 myr ( * ? ?",
    "* ( kastner et al .  1997 ) ) . with this age estimate",
    ", we could then place firmer constraints on the stars distances , and determined that they were a mere @xmath04060 pc from earth .",
    "this range was promptly confirmed by the newly released hipparcos parallax distances to tw hya ( @xmath1 pc ) and one of its four siblings , hd 98800 ( @xmath2 pc ) . in light of their similar ages , distances , and kinematics",
    ", we took the ( perhaps unwise ) leap of christening this little ragtag group of young stars the tw hya association ( twa ) , and declared the twa `` the nearest region of recent star formation '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( kastner et al .  1997 ) ) .",
    "fortunately for us , many subsequent studies  beginning with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* webb et al .  ( 1999 ) ) , and extending to the work of murphy et al .  presented at this meeting",
    " have dramatically expanded the twa s known membership , have confirmed its mean distance as @xmath050 pc , and have honed estimates of its age , which is now generally accepted as @xmath08 myr . meanwhile , tw hya itself has gone on to become the crab nebula of late - stage pre - main sequence accretion and protoplanetary disk studies , with nearly 1000 ` simbad ` references ( 95% of them since 1997 ) as of the writing of this review .",
    "not long after the naming of the twa , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jura et al .  ( 1998 ) ) noted that the a stars hr 4796a , @xmath3 pic , and 49 cet  all massive debris disk hosts  were underluminous for their colors relative to the field a star population , suggesting all three are young .",
    "the youth of the hr 4796ab system had already been established by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stauffer et al .  ( 1995 ) ) on the basis of the position of the m - type star hr 4796b _ above _ the main sequence .",
    "based on the ( relative ) sky proximity of hr 4796ab to the original five stars of the twa , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jura et al .  ( 1998 ) ) further speculated that hr 4796a may also be a twa member ( an assertion subsequently confirmed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* webb et al .  1999 ) ) .    a strong implication of the ( * ?",
    "* jura et al .  ( 1998 ) ) analysis was that @xmath3 pic and the stars of the twa , though not kinematically or spatially associated , were similarly young . at the time , this was somewhat of a revelation , given that some previous estimates had put the age of @xmath3 pic at a few 100 myr ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* barrado y navascus et al .",
    "1999 ) and refs .  therein ) .",
    "the youth of @xmath3 pic was soon firmly established by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) , who honed lists of stars potentially comoving with @xmath3 pic and identified just three m star `` survivors , '' all of age @xmath020 myr .",
    "this work constituted the first identification of the @xmath3 pic moving group ( @xmath3pmg )  its original membership , like that of the original twa , could be counted on one hand .",
    "not long thereafter , the wider availability and improved application of space velocity data would begin to dramatically expand the known membership of the @xmath3pmg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( zuckerman et al .  2001 ) ) .    at the risk of stating the obvious , the general approach pioneered by zuckerman ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zuckerman & webb 2000 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zuckerman et al .  2001 ) ) , song ( e.g. , ) , torres , and a few other investigators  i.e. , selecting candidate young stars on the basis of proper motions and/or x - ray fluxes , and following up spectroscopically to confirm signatures of youth and obtain @xmath4 velocities  has been refined and improved tremendously over the past @xmath015 years . in particular , statistically rigorous treatments of stellar kinematics ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* malo et al . 2013 ) ) have replaced the original , painstaking , `` by - hand '' searches of the hipparcos and tycho catalogs , and the galex uv sky survey data have replaced the rass as a superior means to select active ( hence , possibly young ) late - type stars in the field ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shkolnik et al .  2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rodriguez et al .  2013 ) ) .",
    "thus , the techniques first brought to bear to identify and confirm members of the twa and @xmath3pmg have now been successfully applied to identify ( and/or expand the memberships of ) another dozen or so established and candidate nymgs ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * zuckerman et al .",
    "2011 ) and review by mamajek in these proceedings ) .",
    "i summarize here three recent examples of studies involving @xmath3pmg members that highlight the utility of studies of nymgs and their members for purposes of improving our understanding of pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) stellar evolution , evolved protoplanetary disks , and young exoplanets .",
    "the comprehensive study of the @xmath3pmg by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mamajek & bell ( 2014 ) ) well illustrates how a nymg can serve as a testbed both for the astrophysics of pre - main sequence stars and techniques for age - dating stars and stellar associations .",
    "mamajek & bell compiled and critically compared a dozen @xmath3pmg age determinations involving roughly a half - dozen different techniques , including placement on pre - ms star isochrones , kinematic traceback , li depletion , and variants thereof .",
    "they conclude that the age of the @xmath3pmg should be revised upwards , from the widely quoted @xmath012 myr ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zuckerman et al .  2001 ) ; ) to @xmath023 myr ( which is , ironically , closer to the original estimate by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* barrado y navascus et al .  1999 ) ) .",
    "however , this refinement in the age of the @xmath3pmg is perhaps less interesting than the conclusion by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mamajek & bell ( 2014 ) ) that , at least in application to the @xmath3pmg stars , the li depletion boundary and isochronal age estimation techniques are superior to kinematic methods of age determination .",
    "given the interesting , fundamental problems in stellar astrophysics that are inherent in the former two methods ( as highlighted in talks by bell , song , somers and others at this meeting ) , it is clear that the tests of li depletion boundary and isochronal age determinations offered by studies of nymgs will become increasingly important , moving forward .",
    "though it remains understudied , especially relative to tw hya , the @xmath3pmg member system v4046 sgr is nearly as close ( @xmath5 pc ) and , arguably , at least as interestingreipurth / newsletter / newsletter245.pdf . ] .",
    "this hierarchical multiple system features a close , near - equal - components , solar - mass binary that is orbited by , and actively accreting from , a molecule - rich circumbinary disk .",
    "the disk is surprisingly extensive and massive ( outer co radius @xmath0350 au and estimated h@xmath6 mass @xmath00.09 @xmath7 , ( * ? ? ?",

    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rapson et al .  ( 2015 ) ) used the new gemini planet imager ( gpi ) to obtain near - infared coronagraphic / polarimetric ( scattered - starlight ) images of the innermost disk regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v4046sgrmodels ] , right panel ) .",
    "thanks to the combination of gpi s exquisite performance and the proximity of v4046 sgr , these images probe the structure of the dust disk to within @xmath07 au of the central binary , at a jaw - dropping @xmath03 au resolution .",
    "the gpi imaging reveals concentric rings of submicron - sized dust grains that are contained within the ring of submm - sized grains responsible for thermal emission in submm continuum imaging .",
    "the structures seen in these ( gpi and alma ) images of v4046 sgr ( fig .",

    "indeed , direct imaging of nearby , young stars represents the _ only _ means that will be available in the near future to detect exoplanets in wide ( @xmath95 au ) orbits around their host stars ( see , e.g. , review by chauvin in these proceedings ) .",
    "this potential for nymg members  especially those hosting dusty debris disks  to yield direct - imaging detections of massive exoplanets is , of course , amply demonstrated by the detection and subsequent intensive study of @xmath3 pic b ( e.g. , ) . with gpi and sphere",
