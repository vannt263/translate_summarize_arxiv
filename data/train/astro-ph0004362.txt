    "notwithstanding the difficulties to which heavy obscuration by dust gives rise , we now have a reasonable idea of how luminosity is distributed in the galaxy .",
    "we know we live in a galaxy that has a bar , @xmath3 long , whose nearer end lies at positive longitudes . within the bar",
    "there is a moderately flattened component in which the luminosity density rises roughly as @xmath4 with decreasing galactocentric radius @xmath5 . around the bar",
    "there is a roughly exponential disk with scale length @xmath6 , and a moderately flattened metal - poor halo in which the luminosity density varies as @xmath7 .",
    "the situation regarding the galactic distribution of mass is very much less satisfactory .",
    "observations of external galaxies and cosmological theory have convinced us that light is not a good tracer of mass .",
    "hence we can not straightforwardly translate our models of the luminosity distribution into models of the mass distribution ; in principle , we should start afresh and derive the mass distribution by tracing out the galaxy s gravitational field @xmath8 and then applying the divergence operator : @xmath9 .    from observations of gas that flows in the galactic plane we have a fair idea of what @xmath8 looks like at points @xmath10 within the plane , but we have very little secure knowledge of @xmath11 out of the plane .",
    "this deficiency is serious , because until we know @xmath11 away from the plane , we can not apply @xmath12 _ anywhere _ , and can say _ nothing _ with security about @xmath13 _ anywhere _",
    "!    what we currently know about @xmath11 out of the plane relates to points near the sun .",
    "crz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and holmberg & flynn ( 2000 ) have used proper motions of hipparcos stars to estimate the gradient of @xmath14 near the plane and hence infer that the local mass density is @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , while kuijken & gilmore ( 1991 ) have used the radial velocities of stars at the sgp to estimate @xmath14 at @xmath17 and thus infer that the surface density of the galaxy within @xmath18 of the plane is @xmath19 . to constrain @xmath11 at points that lie far from the sun",
    ", we have to study objects that move to such points .",
    "high - velocity stars are the obvious tracers to use , because they are so numerous .",
    "they strongly constrain models of @xmath11 because stars on essentially the same orbit can be studied both locally and in situ ( binney , 1994 ; dehnen & binney , 1996 ) . unfortunately",
    ", the potential of this approach has yet to be systematically exploited .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest in using tidal streamers associated with disrupted satellites as tracers of @xmath11 ( johnston et al .  1999 ,",
    "helmi et al .  1999 ) .",
    "my own view is that high - velocity stars have greater potential because ( a ) they are vastly more numerous and ( b ) they do not require approximations of the level of the ( manifestly false ) assumption that all elements of a streamer are on the same orbit",
    ". moreover , extracting useful information from streamers requires space - based astrometry , the requisite observations high - velocity stars are available now , and all that s lacking is machinery for modelling them .",
    "gravitational microlensing directly probes the galaxy s mass distribution , but in a very different way from classical studies of gas and stars .",
    "in fact , microlensing does not measure the smooth galactic force - field @xmath11 but graininess in the mass distribution .",
    "hence , it is insensitive to the contribution to the latter from elementary particles and gas , and is therefore complementary to the traditional approach to the determination of @xmath13 from @xmath11 , rather than competitive with it .",
    "the optical depth to microlensing of a stellar object at distance @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the harmonic mean of the source - lens and lens - observer distances .",
    "if the source is extragalactic , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 becomes proportional to @xmath25 in the direction of the source .",
    "suppose we measure @xmath24 along many lines of sight all over the sky .",
    "can we reconstruct @xmath26 from the data ?    with some simplifying assumptions , we can .",
    "binney & gerhard ( 1996 ) show that if the galactic luminosity density @xmath27 is symmetric about the galactic plane and two other , orthogonal planes ( as it would be if it were triaxially ellipsoidal ) , then a richardson ",
    "lucy algorithm can be used to recover @xmath27 from its line - of - sight projection , @xmath28 , at each point @xmath29 on the celestial sphere .",
    "it is straightforward to modify the derivation of binney & gerhard to show that , with the same assumptions regarding symmetry , a richardson ",
    "lucy algorithm for the recovery of @xmath26 from @xmath30 is @xmath31 here the sum over @xmath32 is over the eight points @xmath33 that are connected to @xmath10 by the assumed symmetry of @xmath26 ; the lines of sight to these points are in the directions @xmath34 , and their distances from the sun are @xmath35 .",
    "while it is in principle possible to recover @xmath26 from @xmath24 , it is not clear that this will ever be done .",
    "the problem is the small numerical factor in front of the integral in ( 1 ) .",
    "numerically , @xmath36,\\ ] ] where we have again assumed that the source is extragalactic .",
    "figure [ taufig ] plots @xmath24 for two typical galactic models .",
    "the model underlying the upper panel is the @xmath37-band luminosity model of kent , dame & fazio ( 1991 ) , which has been converted into a model of the stellar mass distribution by assuming a mass - to - light ratio @xmath38 , which appears to be correct for the solar neighbourhood (  10.4.4 of binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "one sees that @xmath24 exceeds @xmath39 only for lines of sight at fairly low latitudes .",
    "existing data indicate that the duration of a microlensing event is typically tens of days , so in an observing season one obtains at most a handful of statistically independent observations per line of sight .",
    "hence , in a given area of the sky the number of lines of sight that must be monitored for of order years to distinguish @xmath24 from zero is @xmath40 . finding this number of extragalactic sources in each of a large number of patches of the sky is hard .",
    "probably our best chance is offered by ` pixel lensing ' towards nearby galaxies .",
    "gould ( 1996 ) gives the necessary theory and i adopt his notation .",
    "a large rle is played in this by the effective stellar flux @xmath41 , which is defined in terms of the stellar luminosity function @xmath42 by @xmath43 per resolution element on a galaxy image , the rate at which microlensing events can be detected above a signal - to - noise threshold @xmath44 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 are dimensionless functions , and @xmath47 is the rate at which the telescope detects photons from an object of flux @xmath41 . in terms of the surface brightnesses of galaxy and sky @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 over most of a galactic image .",
    "the value of @xmath51 depends on the degree to which the image is resolved into stars : if a significant part of the integral on the top of equation ( [ defsfstar ] ) comes from stars bright enough that lensing of them can be detected even at large impact parameter ( @xmath52 ) , then @xmath51 is small , with @xmath53 otherwise .",
    "gould shows that if one is interested only in measuring @xmath24 regardless of the masses of the lenses that generate it , the optimal observational strategy is to work in the regime @xmath53 in which one detects only high - magnification events",
    ". we shall be in this regime provided @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the rate constant of a typical microlensing event and @xmath56 is the flux in a resolution element of the galactic image .",
    "how big will these quantities be in a typical case ?",
    "suppose we are using a diffraction - limited telescope of diameter @xmath57 to study a galaxy of distance @xmath58 at radius @xmath59 , where the @xmath60-band surface brightness will be @xmath61 .",
    "gould gives the absolute magnitude corresponding to @xmath41 as @xmath62 and estimates that from a star with @xmath63 our telescope will collect photons at a rate @xmath64 .",
    "hence , @xmath65 the @xmath66-band flux in the telescope s resolution element is @xmath67 ^ 2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 is some universal constant",
    ". we can express @xmath41 in terms of this same constant and @xmath69 thus @xmath70 when we substitute equations ( [ givesalphaf ] ) , ( [ givesfpsf ] ) and ( [ givesfstar ] ) into equation ( [ spikecond ] ) and assume ( table 4.4 of binney & merrifield , 1998 ) @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( de jong , 1995 ) the condition to be in the high - magnification regime becomes @xmath73 gould finds that @xmath74 is required for detection , so this condition is satisfied for @xmath75 and @xmath76 . by equations ( [ givesrate ] ) , ( [ givesalphaf ] ) and ( [ givesk ] ) the event rate in this regime is @xmath77 hence , by directing a @xmath78 telescope along a line of sight with @xmath79 , we should be able to detect three to four events per @xmath80 resolution elements per week .",
    "in fact a somewhat higher event rate could be achieved if the telescope were in space , because the event rate is inversely proportional to the sky brightness , which will at least @xmath81mag fainter in space than the ground - based value i have assumed .    if the psf of the telescope has fwhm of @xmath82 arcsec , a galaxy of diameter @xmath83 arcmin offers 3600@xmath84 pixels to monitor .",
    "an @xmath85 galaxy at a distance of @xmath0 has @xmath86 , and will provide @xmath80 pixels if @xmath87 .",
    "thus , a diffraction - limited telescope of modest aperture monitoring galaxies within @xmath0 for of order a year could map @xmath24 sufficiently extensively for it to be possible to recover @xmath26 from a scheme such as ( [ lreq ] ) .    of course",
    ", the values of @xmath24 recovered from such a survey would include contributions from self - lensing within the target object in addition to the optical depth through the milky way . as crotts ( 1992 ) pointed out in relation to pixel lensing of m31 , variations in @xmath24 across the image of an highly inclined galaxy would help one to determine how much self lensing occurs in galactic halos rather than in disks or bulges . consequently",
    ", the analysis of the data from the survey would proceed by modelling in some detail the distribution of @xmath24 in each target galaxy , with the milky way s contribution in that direction as a single number to be fitted to a considerable body of data .",
    "before we lobby nasa and esa for a dedicated microlensing space telescope , we should ask what can be learned from the existing microlensing data .",
    "three areas of the sky have been monitored : ( i ) towards the galactic bulge ; ( ii ) towards some spiral arms ; and ( iii ) towards the magellanic clouds .",
    "if one believes that the dark halo is comprised of elementary particles , only a very small optical depth is predicted towards the clouds ( @xmath88 ) . at @xmath89",
    "the measured optical depth is about three times larger , but still deriving from only 17 events ( alcock et al .",
    "the nature of these events is controversial .",
    "there is a powerful case that many of the lenses lie in the clouds themselves ( kerins & evans , 1999 ) because the only two lenses with reasonably securely determined distances ( from finite - source effects ) do lie in the clouds . on the other hand , ibata et al .",
    "( 1999 ) may have detected a substantial population of old white dwarfs from their proper motions in the hdf .",
    "it is just possible that these objects provide the lenses for a significant number of the observed events .",
    "the arguments against a large column density in white dwarfs remain powerful , however ( gibson & mould 1997 ) .    the eros collaboration ( 2000 ) has observed seven probable microlensing events in the directions of spiral arms , and from them derived an optical depth @xmath90 that is compatible with conventional galaxy models .",
    "unfortunately , the error bar on this measurement is rather large .",
    "several hundred events have been detected by various groups along lines of sight towards the galactic centre , and these data pose a fascinating puzzle .",
    "they are harder to interpret than the data for lines of sight to the clouds because we do not know a priori where the sources are . however ,",
    "if we confine ourselves to the data for red - clump stars , we can have quite a precise estimate of their distribution down each line of sight .",
    "the red - clump stars must follow the general distribution of near infra - red light quite closely , because they are part of the population of evolved stars that are responsible for most of the galaxy s near - ir luminosity .",
    "the dirbe experiment aboard the cobe satellite mapped the galaxy s ir surface brightness in several wavebands , and in the far - ir , where emission by dust is dominant .",
    "spergel , malhotra & blitz ( 1996 ) used these data to estimate the effects of extinction on the near - ir data , and produce maps of what the galaxy would look like in the near - ir bands in the absence of extinction .",
    "binney , gerhard & spergel ( 1997 ) used their richardson ",
    "lucy algorithm to deproject these corrected near - ir data under the assumption that the galaxy has three specified perpendicular planes of mirror symmetry .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ barfig ] shows the luminosity density that they recovered when projected perpendicular to the plane from @xmath91 upwards .",
    "excluding the galactic plane from the projection suppresses local maxima at @xmath6 along the @xmath83 that are a notable feature of the density distribution in the plane ( see fig .  5 of binney et al . ) .",
    "binney et al argued that these maxima were artifacts resulting from the presence in the galactic plane of spiral arms , which violate the assumed eight - fold symmetry .",
    "bissantz & gerhard ( 2000 ) have recently deprojected the same data with an entirely different technique . rather than using the richardson",
    " lucy algorithm , they formulate the deprojection problem as a regularized likelihood maximization .",
    "they do not directly impose any symmetry on the model but have a term in the penalty function that discourages deviations from eight - fold symmetry .",
    "another term in the penalty function encourages luminosity to lie along the spiral arms delineated by ortiz & lepine ( 1993 ) .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ barfig ] shows that explicitly modelling the galaxy s spiral structure in this way has the effect of making the bar longer and thinner than that recovered by binney et al .",
    "( 1997 )  the axis ratio in the plane increases from 2:1 to 3:1 .",
    "this change to the model bar enables the latter to reproduce an important datum that the binney et al bar did not reproduce : the histograms from stanek et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that give for lines of sight at @xmath92 the number of clump stars at each apparent magnitude  see figure [ clumpfig ] .",
    "the ability of the model to reproduce these histograms to good accuracy strongly suggests that the model gives a faithful account of the distribution of red - clump stars .",
    "hence , when this model is used to predict the microlensing optical depth to red - clump stars , we may be confident that any discrepancy does not arise from an incorrect distribution of source objects .",
    "bissantz & gerhard convert their luminosity model of the inner galaxy into a mass model by adopting the constant near - ir mass - to - light ratio @xmath93 of englmaier & gerhard ( 1999 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath93 was obtained by comparing the pattern of gas flow predicted by the binney et al .",
    "model for some assumed @xmath93 to the observed @xmath94 diagrams for hi and co ; if bissantz & gerhard were to repeat this exercise with their new photometric model , they would surely obtain a very similar value of @xmath93 .",
    "once @xmath93 has been chosen , one can calculate the microlensing optical depth for red - clump stars along any line of sight . in baade",
    "s window they obtain @xmath95 , which is essentially identical to the value obtained by bissantz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the shorter , fatter bar of binney et al .  (",
    "1997 ) , and significantly short of the values from the macho collaboration : @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) directly measured for bulge clump giants by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and @xmath98 estimated by alcock et al . , ( 2000b ) for bulge stars from a difference - imaging analysis of an inhomogeneous collection of sources .",
    "evidently one can not obtain agreement with the macho optical depth under the assumption that mass follows light .",
    "since the difference between the optical depth implied by constant @xmath93 and the measured value is so large , it is natural to investigate an extreme model in which we ask , what is the minimum mass that is compatible with the red - clump optical depth attaining the macho value ?",
    "most of the red - clump sources lensed in baade s window @xmath99 lie close to the galaxy s @xmath100 axis , so we simplify the calculation by considering a source that lies distance @xmath101 from plane on the axis . consider the contribution to @xmath24 from a band of mass @xmath102 and radius @xmath5 around the galactic centre .",
    "if we assume that the band s surface density never increases with distance from the plane , then its mass will be minimized for a given optical depth when its surface density is constant and the line - of - sight to the source just cuts its edge .",
    "so we take the band s half - width to be @xmath103 , which makes the band s surface density @xmath104 substituting this into equation ( 1 ) we find the band s optical depth to be @xmath105 independent of radius ( kuijken , 1997 ) .",
    "this minimum mass estimate holds if the mass is widely distributed in radius rather than concentrated in a single band , because we can imagine a radially continuous mass distribution to be made up of a large number of bands , and we have shown that when the band is optimally configured , its optical depth depends only on its mass .    from equation ( [ basicm ] )",
    "@xmath106 is needed to produce the optical depth , to bulge sources that is implied by the latest macho results .",
    "a more realistic mass estimate is in excess of @xmath107 because realistically we must assume that the surface density of the band falls off smoothly with distance from the plane , and if this decline is exponential with the optimal scale - height ( @xmath108 $ ] ) , the band s mass must be e times that given by ( [ basicm ] ) for a given optical depth , while if the vertical density profile is gaussian with optimal scale - height ( @xmath108 $ ] ) , equation ( [ basicm ] ) underestimates the band s mass by a factor @xmath109 .    for comparison ,",
    "the mass of the galaxy interior to the sun is of order @xmath110 .",
    "thus this naivest estimate of the mass interior to the sun is just barely equal to the _ minimum _ mass required in a circular configuration to produce the reported optical depth , which suggests that an axisymmetric galaxy is incompatible with the macho results this must be a tentative conclusion , however , until one has taken into account the effect on a body s circular - speed curve @xmath111 of the body being strongly flatted .",
    "binney , bissantz & gerhard ( 2000 ) show that it _ is _ possible to choose the galaxy s radial density profile in such a way that the required optical depth is obtained without generating a value of @xmath112 that conflicts with observation .",
    "however , such radial density profiles require more matter in the solar neighbourhood than observations of the oort limit ( crz et al , 1998 ; holmberg & flynn , 2000 ) and the mass within @xmath18 of the plane ( kuijken & gilmore , 1991 ) imply .",
    "consequently , we can safely conclude that an axisymmetric galaxy can not have as large an optical depth as that reported .",
    "can one achieve a higher optical depth within a give mass budget by making the bands elliptical rather than circular ?",
    "imagine deforming an initially circular band into an elliptical shape while holding constant the radius @xmath5 at which the line of sight to our sources cuts the band .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if the column density through the band to the sources is to be independent of the band s eccentricity @xmath113 , its mass @xmath114 must satisfy @xmath115 where @xmath42 is the angle between the band s major axis and the sun  centre line . for @xmath116",
    ", @xmath114 is a minimum with respect to @xmath113 at @xmath117 substituting equation ( [ emin ] ) in equation ( [ mofe ] ) we find the minimum mass to be @xmath118 and to require axis ratio @xmath119 ( zhao & mao , 1996 ) .    for @xmath120 , a value favoured by binney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ; for @xmath123 , we find @xmath124 and @xmath125 . hence",
    ", making the bands elliptical realistically reduces the mass required to generate a given optical depth by at most @xmath126 . in practice",
    "we can not reduce our requirement for mass by so large a factor because the structure of the galaxy s stellar bar is strongly constrained by both near - ir photometry ( blitz & spergel , 1991 ; bissantz et al . ,",
    "1997 ) and radio - frequency observations of gas that flows in the galactic plane ( englmaier & gerhard , 1999 ; fux , 1999 ) .",
    "binney et al .  ( 2000 ) estimate the possible reduction in mass by assuming that material at @xmath2 forms a bar of optimal eccentricity whose long axis makes an angle of @xmath127 with the sun  centre line , while the galaxy is axisymmetric at @xmath128 .",
    "they show that if the vertical structure of such a galaxy is chosen to be optimal for lensing , then a radial density profile can be found that nowhere exceeds the observed value of @xmath112 and is also compatible with the constraints on the density of matter at @xmath129 .",
    "they argue , however , that such galaxy models can be excluded for two main reasons .",
    "first , they predict values of @xmath112 that are too small at @xmath130 because at small @xmath131 they place significant mass high above the plane , where it contributes to @xmath24 but not @xmath112 .",
    "second , these models do not leave enough room in @xmath112 for ( i ) departures from the optimal vertical profile and ( ii ) the presence of matter , such as interstellar gas and non - baryonic matter , that contributes to @xmath112 but not @xmath24 .    hence , even though we do nt know much about the galactic force - field , we know enough to exclude the measured optical depth in baade s window !",
    "in fact , if we were to take seriously the prediction of simulations of the cosmological clustering of cdm that dark matter contributes substantially to the mass interior to the sun ( e.g. , navarro & steinmetz , 2000 ) , our predicted optical depth for baade s window would be significantly _ less _ than @xmath39 , a factor of 4 or more below the measured value .",
    "something is seriously wrong here ."
