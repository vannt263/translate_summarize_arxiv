    "extended x - ray emission in seyfert galaxies represents a potentially powerful probe of these active galactic nuclei .",
    "such x - rays could originate from either a hot , collisionally - ionized or a much cooler photoionized gas .",
    "both may plausibly be expected to be present in these objects .",
    "the narrow line regions of seyferts are known to be the sites of mass motions of several hundreds to @xmath8 .",
    "shocks associated with these motions will generate gas with temperatures @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 k. hot gas may also be present in the form of outflowing winds driven by radiation or radio jets from the nucleus .",
    "the compact , hard , uv  soft x - ray nuclear continuum source is believed to photoionize the narrow line region .",
    "lines from highly ionized species , such as he ii , [ ne v ] , [ fe vii ] , [ fe x ] , [ fe xi ] and [ fe xiv ] , are found in the optical and infrared spectra of these objects .",
    "x - ray lines from highly ionized species may , therefore , also be expected .",
    "high velocity shocks can also be powerful sources of ionizing radiation and , if present , should provide both collisionally- and photo - ionized gas . by searching for both of these components , x - ray observations can probe whether shocks are significant sources of ionizing radiation for the narrow line region .",
    "extended x - ray emission can also arise through electron scattering and fluorescence of the nuclear radiation in extended gas .",
    "morphological correspondences between the x - ray emitting gas and the optical line and radio continuum structures may provide clues to the nature of the x - ray emission .    for these reasons",
    ", we have begun a program of observing seyfert galaxies with chandra .",
    "previous x - ray observatories have lacked the high spatial resolution ( @xmath11 ) , wide energy coverage ( 0.1  10 kev ) and good spectral resolution ( @xmath12 from the ccd detectors ) of chandra .",
    "these capabilities are ideal for investigation of extended gas in seyferts , and in this paper we present the results of observations of the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 .",
    "ngc 1068 was observed on three occasions with the einstein observatory ipc by @xcite .",
    "they found that the 0.1  4.5 kev spectrum could be described by a power law with energy index @xmath13 and absorbing column density consistent with the galactic value .",
    "combination of exosat and einstein ipc observations @xcite showed that the x - ray spectrum can be decomposed into two components  a steep low energy ( @xmath14 ) part with @xmath15 and a flat high energy ( 2  10 kev ) part with @xmath16 .",
    "this was the first detection in a seyfert 2 of the hard power - law x - ray source known to be present in seyfert 1s .",
    "any intrinsic absorption was shown to be small ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "ginga observations @xcite confirmed the presence of the hard source above 2 kev , and also discovered an intense iron line with equivalent width @xmath18 , in accord with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a higher spectral resolution ( fwhm @xmath19 ) observation with bbxrt .",
    "they found a total equivalent width for the fe k line of 2.8 kev , and modeled the line profile in terms of three components corresponding to fluorescence of neutral ( and lowly ionized ) iron and recombination into both he - like and h - like iron .",
    "fe l - shell emission was also detected . in a study with asca",
    ", @xcite found emission from the h - like and / or he - like ions of ne , mg , si and s and confirmed the fe l and fe k features found by @xcite .",
    "the best fit power - law spectrum above 3 kev has energy index @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite interpreted the steep low energy ( @xmath21 ) spectrum in terms of a two temperature ( 0.59 and 0.14 kev ) , optically - thin coronal plasma model .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the asca data , confirming the 3 components to the fe k line complex which they interpreted with a model of cold and warm reflection .",
    "@xcite developed both photoionization and hot plasma models , including a hard reflected continuum .",
    "their photoionized gas model is in good agreement with the emission lines observed by asca assuming solar metallicity for all elements except iron , which is more than twice solar , and oxygen , which is less than 0.25 solar .",
    "ngc 1068 has recently been studied with bepposax .",
    "@xcite detected the galaxy in the 20  100 kev band , supporting models envisaging a mixture of both neutral and ionized reflections of an otherwise invisible nuclear source . the nucleus is completely obscured at all energies , implying it is `` compton - thick ''  i.e. the column density of absorbing matter exceeds @xmath22 ( see also matt et al .",
    "soft x - ray spectroscopy with bepposax @xcite reveals a spectrum rich in k@xmath23 transitions of various elements below 3 kev .    the only x - ray image of ngc 1068 was obtained with the rosat hri by @xcite with @xmath24  @xmath25 resolution . the observed x - ray emission could be divided into three components : i ) an unresolved ( radius @xmath26 ) source associated with the seyfert nucleus , ii ) resolved circumnuclear ( radius @xmath27 ) emission extending preferentially towards the ne and iii ) large - scale ( @xmath28 ) emission aligned ne - sw .",
    "@xcite interpreted the circumnuclear emission as thermal emission from a nuclear wind and the large - scale emission as either associated with the disk starburst or an extension of the nuclear wind to larger radii .",
    "further rosat hri observations were reported by @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite have reported a high spectral resolution observation of ngc 1068 with the xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer .",
    "their spectrum reveals a large number of emission lines below 2 kev .",
    "based on the narrowness of the recombination radiation continua , the fact that the forbidden lines are stronger than the resonance lines in helium - like triplets , and the weakness of fe l emission compared to fe k emission , @xcite conclude that the emission is dominated by recombination in cool x - ray photoionized gas .",
    "the n and o helium - like triplets may contain a @xmath29 component in collisional equilibrium .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : obs_red ] we describe the observations and their reductions .",
    "section [ sec : x_morph ] provides a brief discussion of the x - ray morphology , while section [ sec : x_spec ] presents the x - ray spectra obtained for the nucleus and five spatially extended regions .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray images with those in other wavebands is presented in section [ sec : comparison ] , and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "future papers will address the compact sources in the field and present a more detailed analysis of the extended emission .",
    "ngc 1068 is at a heliocentric redshift of @xmath30 @xcite which , after correction to the frame of the microwave background and assuming @xmath31 and @xmath32 , corresponds to 22.8 mpc , so @xmath33 is equivalent to 110 pc .",
    "the galactic column density towards ngc 1068 is @xmath34 @xcite",
    "since the nucleus of ngc 1068 is known to be a strong x - ray source , we were concerned that `` pile - up '' could affect the chandra observations . in order to measure the chandra count rate from the nucleus and circumnuclear regions , we first obtained a short observation ( obsid 343 ) of ngc 1068 on 1999 december 9 using chip s3 ( backside illuminated ) of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite 2000 ) .",
    "single exposures with a 0.1 s frame - time were alternated with two exposures with a 0.4 s frame - time , the total integration time being @xmath35 ks .",
    "this observation showed that the nucleus is significantly piled up in the 0.4 s frame - time , but not in the 0.1 s frame - time .",
    "it also demonstrated that the count rate in the region extending @xmath36 ne from the nucleus is so high that data obtained from this region with the default frame - time of 3.2 s would be piled up , but data obtained with a 0.4 s frame - time would not be piled up . on this basis",
    "we decided to observe ngc 1068 for separate , longer exposures in all of 0.1 s , 0.4 s , and 3.2 s frame - times .",
    "the longer 0.1 s , 0.4 s and 3.2 s frame - time observations were thus designed to study primarily the x - ray emission of the nucleus , the extended region to the ne of the nucleus and the larger scale emission , respectively .",
    "these longer integrations were taken with the acis instrument in two separate observations .",
    "on 2000 february 21 the standard 3.2 s frame - time was used .",
    "ccds i2 , i3 , s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 were read out , though all of the detected x - ray emission from ngc 1068 is on s3 .",
    "on 2000 february 22 the readouts were alternated between one 0.1 s and two 0.4 s frame - times in order to mitigate the effects of pile - up in the inner regions , as discussed above .",
    "the data were screened for times of high background count rates and aspect errors in the usual way .",
    "the 3.2 s , 0.4 s and 0.1 s frame - time data have total good exposure times of 47016.2 s , 11465.4 s and 1433.2 s , respectively .",
    "the `` livetimes '' for the alternating mode exposures were given incorrectly in the header and had to be computed separately .",
    "a corrected formula for the exposure time ( g. allen , private communication ) was used , and the resulting livetimes are equal to the frame - time multiplied by the number of exposures taken with that frame - time .",
    "spectra and instrument responses were generated using ciao v1.1.5 and analyzed with xspec v11.0.1 .",
    "spectra were grouped to have at least 25 counts per energy bin to ensure that the @xmath37 fitting of the data was valid .",
    "when extracting spectra from complex regions the backscal keyword ( equal to the fractional area of the chip occupied by the extraction region ) was computed by hand , as the values generated by ciao are often incorrect .    in the absence of the gratings , x - ray spectra from ccd detectors such as acis",
    "are not invertible , i.e. one can not uniquely determine the x - ray spectrum from the observed counts . to model such data",
    "the following technique is used .",
    "a parameterized model of the source spectrum is computed and folded through the instrument response . the folded model and data",
    "are then compared using , e.g. , the @xmath37 test .",
    "parameters of the model spectrum are adjusted to minimize the @xmath37 difference between the folded model and the data .",
    "the error bars for a single parameter are given by the range over which that parameter may be varied with @xmath38 , keeping the other model parameters fixed .",
    "this is equivalent to the 90 per cent confidence interval for a single interesting parameter .",
    "the backside illuminated s3 chip has a high sensitivity to very soft x - rays and significant counts at @xmath39 were seen from all regions .",
    "however the instrument response is uncertain below 0.50 kev , and this uncertainty increases towards lower energies .",
    "we thus restricted our modeling to photon energies above 0.25 kev .",
    "counts were extracted from a 375 diameter circle centered on the nucleus .",
    "the 3.2  s frame - time data are extremely piled up and can not be used for spectral fitting . in the 0.4  s frame - time data there are 25251 counts corresponding to a count rate of @xmath40  ctps . . in the 0.1  s frame - time data",
    "there are 4760 counts corresponding to a count rate of @xmath41  ctps . .",
    "the difference in count rate is due , in part , to the presence of pile - up in the 0.4  s frame - time data .",
    "the background is negligible in both this and the ne region .",
    "counts were extracted from a 41 @xmath42 46 rectangle with longer length in position angle ( pa ) = @xmath43 centered on the extended emission 425 to the ne of the nucleus .",
    "this region does not overlap with the region used to extract the spectrum of the nucleus . in the 3.2  s frame - time data",
    "there are 26871 counts corresponding to a count rate of @xmath44  ctps . .",
    "in the 0.4  s frame - time data there are 10069 counts corresponding to a count rate of @xmath45  ctps . .",
    "in the 0.1 s data there are 1349 counts corresponding to a count rate of @xmath46  ctps . .",
    "thus , there is significant pile - up in the 3.2 s frame - time data in this region .",
    "the distribution and spectrum of larger scale emission was investigated with the 3.2 s frame - time data .",
    "the large scale region was divided into four quadrants with position angles @xmath47 ( quadrant a ) , @xmath48 ( quadrant b ) , @xmath49 ( quadrant c ) and @xmath50 ( quadrant d ) .",
    "position angle @xmath51 , the bisector of quadrant b , corresponds to the approximate position angles of the radio emission and narrow line regions to the ne of the nucleus .",
    "extraction regions between nuclear distances of @xmath52 and @xmath53 within quadrants a , b , c and d are termed the `` west '' , `` north '' , `` east '' and `` south '' regions respectively , and are shown in figure [ fig : extraction ] .",
    "obvious point sources determined by eye were excluded .",
    "pile - up is not significant in any of these regions .",
    "it is difficult to determine the spectrum of the background for the larger scale emission as there are no source - free regions nearby . to overcome this problem",
    ", we used a compilation of observations of relatively blank fields , from which discrete sources have been excised . for a particular source extraction region , a corresponding background region",
    "is taken from this compilation .",
    "the two regions have the same physical location on the s3 chip .",
    "the background images and software@xmath54 of maxim markevitch were used for this procedure .",
    "grey scale images of the 0.1 s and 0.4 s frame - time chandra x - ray observations of ngc  1068 are shown in figures [ fig : im_01 ] and [ fig : im_04 ] respectively .",
    "the brightest region , which we refer to as the nucleus , extends @xmath0 to the ne .",
    "somewhat fainter x - ray emission extends @xmath55 ne of the nucleus in pa @xmath56  @xmath57 , and perpendicular to this direction from 25 se to 25 nw of the nucleus .",
    "there is a second peak of emission 35 to the ne of the nucleus , with a brightness equal to approximately 15 per cent of the nucleus ; this peak lies within the `` ne region '' ( see section [ sec : reduction_ne ] ) .",
    "a grey scale image of the 3.2 s frame - time observation is shown in figure [ fig : im_32 ] .",
    "this image agrees well with the rosat hri image @xcite when allowance is made for the lower resolution ( @xmath24  @xmath25 ) of the latter .",
    "two bright `` prongs '' of x - ray emission extend from the bright region around the nucleus .",
    "one extends from the northern tip along pa @xmath58 for 75 , and the second extends from the southern tip along pa @xmath59 for 65 before turning to follow pa @xmath60 for 4 .",
    "significant extended x - ray emission is seen out to at least @xmath61 to the ne , @xmath7 to the sw , @xmath62 to the nw and @xmath63 to the se of the nucleus .",
    "the most obvious large scale structures appear to be `` spiral arms '' that curve to lower pa with increasing radius from the nucleus , i.e. they are `` trailing '' arms .",
    "they may also be seen in an image of the 3.2 s frame - time data that has been smoothed by a gaussian of @xmath64 ( figure [ fig : im_smoothed ] ) .",
    "the images also show many point sources of x - ray emission associated with ngc 1068 .",
    "the x - ray morphologies in the 0.25  0.80 kev , 0.80  2.00 kev and 2.00  7.50 kev bands are shown in figure [ fig : im_panel ] , for the 0.1 s , 0.4 s and 3.2 s frame - time observations .",
    "the 0.25  0.80 kev x - ray emission has the greatest spatial extent , covering the range described above . the nucleus , ne region , the two `` prongs '' and the trailing arms are clearly seen .",
    "only a few point sources , however , appear in these soft x - ray images . in the 0.80  2.00 kev energy band",
    ", there is still significant emission out to tens of arc - seconds , and many more point sources are visible . in the hardest energy band , 2.00  7.50 kev , emission extends at least @xmath65 to the ne and sw of the nucleus and at least @xmath66 to the nw and se .",
    "the two `` prongs '' ( to the n and e ) do not stand out in hard x - rays , perhaps because of the lower sensitivity in this band . as",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) at the location of the nucleus is circularly symmetric the observed , elongated extended hard x - rays are real .",
    "in addition , many hard point sources are clearly seen @xmath67 from the nucleus .",
    "initially the x - ray spectrum of the nucleus was modeled as an absorbed hot plasma with solar metal abundances .",
    "we used the `` mekal '' model @xcite , which is included in the x - ray spectral fitting software xspec .",
    "the 0.1 s frame - time data were used as these do not suffer from pile - up .",
    "the model does not fit the data ( see table  [ tab : nuc_cont ] ) , so a single hot plasma may be ruled out .",
    "such plasmas overproduce iron l emission lines ( i.e. transitions to the @xmath68 level ) between 0.7  1.2 kev , and underproduce the high energy continuum above a few kev .",
    "a better fit is obtained if the metal abundances are allowed to vary , but the best fit value of zero is implausible for the nucleus of a spiral galaxy .",
    "a model consisting of two hot plasmas , with temperatures of 0.17 kev and 0.73 kev and metal abundances of 3.0 per cent of solar and 2.7 per cent of solar respectively , provides an adequate description of the spectrum below 2 kev ( @xmath69 for 74 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) ) again , such low metal abundances are unlikely to be found in the inner regions of a spiral galaxy , so multiple hot plasma models are implausible for the nucleus of ngc 1068 .",
    "many lines are seen below 1 kev in the xmm - newton rgs spectrum ( paerels et al 2000 ) , but these are confused by the limited spectral resolution of the chandra acis spectrum reported here .",
    "individual lines are sufficiently narrow to be unresolved by acis .",
    "we therefore decided to take a more phenomenological approach , [ sec : phenom ] modeling the data by a continuum plus individual emission lines .",
    "firstly the continuum was described by a smooth model consisting of a bremsstrahlung plus a power law , both absorbed by the galactic column .",
    "the residuals between the data and this smooth model were inspected by eye .",
    "emission lines were then added to the model at energies expected to reduce the value of @xmath37 .",
    "the energy and flux of these lines were free parameters .",
    "this process was repeated , adding lines until either an acceptable fit was achieved , or no further improvement was possible .",
    "finally , our observed line energies were compared with those of the xmm - newton rgs spectrum ( a hard copy of which was kindly provided by f. paerels ) and , if agreement found , identified with lines therein .",
    "the 0.1 s frame - time data are well described by a 0.45 kev bremsstrahlung plasma plus a hard power law of photon index @xmath70 plus a number of narrow emission lines , all absorbed by the galactic column ( last model in table  [ tab : nuc_cont ] ) .",
    "the spectrum and best fitting model are shown in figure [ fig : spec_nuc ] and the emission lines are listed in table  [ tab : nuc_lines ] .",
    "radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) are due to free - bound transitions from energy levels just above the ionization threshold ; hence these lines start at the ionization threshold energy , and extend to higher energies ( e.g. paerels et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "our spectrum below 2 kev is generally consistent with lines seen in the xmm - newton rgs spectrum @xcite .",
    "the lines near and above 2 kev can not be uniquely identified but are well described by neutral , hydrogen - like or helium - like lines of si , s or ar , with the exception of lines between 6.40 and 6.97 kev attributed to fe .",
    "the fe line complex is well described by a neutral fe line with an equivalent width of 2.24 kev , although it should be noted that the true level of the continuum at the iron line energy is difficult to determine .",
    "the iron line is better resolved in the 0.4 s frame time data ( see below ) . in view of the low signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the line flux densities are quite uncertain .",
    "the best fitting model has an unabsorbed 0.5  2.0 kev flux of @xmath71 corresponding to an unabsorbed rest frame 0.5  2.0 kev luminosity of @xmath72 and an unabsorbed 2.0  10.0 kev flux of @xmath73 corresponding to an unabsorbed rest frame 2.0  10.0 kev luminosity of @xmath74 .",
    "the 2.0  10.0 kev flux and luminosity will have fractional errors comparable to the power law component of the model , listed in table [ tab : nuc_cont ] .    the 0.4 s frame - time observation of the nucleus suffer from pile - up and it is difficult to determine the true shape of the continuum and the individual line fluxes .",
    "a recent model by @xcite , which is included as part of the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ) , includes effects of pile up in modeling spectra .",
    "we fitted the same spectral model to the 0.4 s frame - time data as was used to describe the 0.1 s frame - time data , with the continuum parameters allowed to vary and the emission line parameters fixed .",
    "the residuals between the data and this model were examined by eye and any clear discrepancies noted .",
    "the fluxes of model lines at energies near such discrepancies were then allowed to vary in an attempt to improve the fit . if this did not provide a satisfactory improvement , the line energy was also allowed to vary . if no model line existed near an obvious feature a new line was added .",
    "the reduced @xmath37 values for these overall fits were not as good as those for the 0.1 s frame - time data because we kept most of the line parameters fixed , even though very small changes may have improved the agreement between data and model .",
    "the pile - up fraction was estimated to be 22 per cent , and the continuum parameters ware close to those found for the 0.1 s frame - time data ; the bremsstrahlung component was 0.1 kev warmer , and the power law component was slightly harder ( but within the 0.1 s frame - time error bars ) than the parameters derived from the 0.1 s frame - time observations .",
    "these small discrepancies are probably a result of imperfect modeling of the pile - up .",
    "emission - line fluxes from the 0.4 s frame - time observation are listed in the lower portion of table  [ tab : nuc_lines ] .",
    "note that the line fluxes tabulated for the 0.4 s frame time are the new _ total _ fluxes of those lines that have changed or been added , and are _ not _ the difference in line flux between the 0.1 s and 0.4 s frame - time observations .",
    "the 0.4 s differ from the 0.1 s results in that : i ) the o viii rrc line is stronger ( significantly above the 0.1 s frame - time error bars ) , ii ) an al line at 1.72 kev is probably present , iii ) an `` absorption '' feature is seen at 1.54 kev that coincides with a sudden change in the effective area of the telescope , and is therefore probably caused by pile - up , iv ) the ar line better describes the data if it is shifted to 2.97 kev , and v ) the fe line is resolved into a neutral ( 6.4 kev ) and ionized component ( @xmath75 kev ) , the normalization of their sum being consistent with the single fe line seen in the 0.1 s frame - time data .",
    "the fluxes of the neutral and ionized components are comparable .",
    "the 0.4 s frame - time data do not suffer from pile - up in the ne region , and have been used to determine both the shape of the continuum and the emission lines present .",
    "the 3.2 s data suffer from pile - up but have a higher signal - to - noise ratio and have been used where possible to investigate the x - ray emission lines , especially at higher energies .",
    "the 0.4 s frame - time observations of the ne region were initially modeled by an absorbed hot thermal plasma with solar metal abundances , using the mekal model in xspec .",
    "the mekal model does not provide a good description of the data ( see table  [ tab : ne_cont ] ) and may be ruled out .",
    "the model overproduces emission lines between 0.7 and 1.2 kev due to transitions to the l - shell of iron ions , and underproduces the high energy continuum above a few kev .",
    "the addition of a second hot thermal plasma with solar metal abundance improves the quality of the fit but again does not provide a good description of the spectrum ( table [ tab : ne_cont ] ) .      to further investigate the emission lines in the spectrum , the continuum was modeled by a smooth function consisting of two thermal bremsstrahlung components absorbed by the galactic column .",
    "no physical meaning should be attributed to such a model , as an absorbed bremsstrahlung plus a power law model could have been used instead . repeating the technique used to fit the spectrum of the nucleus , narrow emission lines",
    "were then added to the model .",
    "the xmm - newton rgs spectrum ( paerels 2000 ) was again used as a guide for the identification of the soft x - ray lines .",
    "as noted above , the spectral resolution of the acis is too low to provide unique identifications of the soft x - ray emission lines , many of which are blended together in our data below 1 kev .",
    "two bremsstrahlung components with temperatures of 0.39 kev and 2.84 kev plus the stronger emission lines seen by @xcite and a line at 2.38 kev , all absorbed by the galactic column provides a good description of the spectrum with a @xmath37 of 78 for 62 d.o.f .",

    "this data point is @xmath77 higher than its two neighbors over an energy range of 15 ev ( figure [ fig : spec_ne ] ) .",
    "this is much narrower than the instrumental response and the reason for this feature is unknown .",
    "the line observed in the acis spectrum at 0.68 kev falls in the gap between strong lines of o viii ly @xmath23 , fe xvii and the radiative recombination continua of n vii and o vii seen in the rgs spectrum , and has been attributed to a blurred combination of these .",
    "the line at an observed energy of 0.76 kev is close to o viii ly @xmath78 seen in the rgs spectrum , and has been attributed to this transition .",
    "the small discrepancy in line energy may result from blending with the rrc of o vii at 0.74 kev .",

    "the changes are as follows : i ) the n vii line has a preferred energy of 0.54 kev which corresponds to a sudden change in the effective area of the telescope , and is therefore probably caused by pile - up , ii ) the ne ix triplet is stronger , iii ) the ne ix he @xmath78 line is weaker , and iv ) an fe line is tentatively detected , but its energy is poorly constrained ,        we followed a similar procedure to that used for the nucleus and ne region , applying it to the west , north , east and south regions in turn .",
    "the 3.2 s frame - time observations were used as they have the longest exposure time and do not suffer from pile - up .",
    "a hot plasma absorbed by the galactic column does not provide a good description of the data from any of these regions , even if the metal abundances are allowed to vary ( see table [ tab : extended_cont ] ) .",
    "the preferred values of the metal abundances are very low ( less than 12 per cent solar ) , and the thermal model does not fit the significant hard x - ray emission seen from each region above 2 kev . we conclude that a single temperature thermal plasma model , absorbed by the galactic column , can not describe the spectrum in any of the larger scale extended regions .      the phenomenological approach described in section [ sec : phenom ] was again used to study the emission lines from each of these regions .",
    "the continuum was described by a smooth model consisting of a bremsstrahlung plus power law , both absorbed by the galactic column , to which individual emission lines were then added .",
    "the parameters of the continuum fits are listed in table [ tab : extended_cont ] , and the emission lines listed in tables [ tab : west_lines ] ( west ) , [ tab : north_lines ] ( north ) , [ tab : east_lines ] ( east ) and [ tab : south_lines ] ( south ) .",
    "the spectrum and models are shown in figures [ fig : west ] ( west ) , [ fig : north ] ( north ) , [ fig : east ] ( east ) and [ fig : south ] ( south ) .",
    "good fits were obtained with bremsstrahlung components with temperatures in the range 0.36  1.06 kev and power laws with photon indices in the range @xmath83 to @xmath84 , with the harder ( lower ) photon indices in the south and east regions .",
    "there is significant hard x - ray emission above 2 kev from each region , and an iron line is seen from the west , north and south regions .",
    "the unabsorbed broad - band fluxes and luminosities are listed in table  [ tab : extended_flux ] .",
    "the energy dependent psf of the chandra mirrors will scatter a fraction of the flux from the nucleus and ne region over tens of arc - seconds and this can significantly contaminate the spectra of the larger scale extended emission regions . in particular , the wings of the psf are stronger at higher energies and it is important to assess the reliability of the hard x - ray emission seen on the larger scales .",
    "firstly , the spectra show hard ( @xmath85 ) x - ray fluxes differing by a factor of @xmath86 between the east ( the weakest ) and south ( the strongest ) regions ( see figures [ fig : east ] and [ fig : south ] respectively ) . in the regions between @xmath87 ",
    "@xmath53 a similar difference in hard x - ray flux is also seen ( figure [ fig : far_extended ] ) , with stronger emission from the west and south .",
    "as the psf is essentially circularly symmetric these must be due to differences in the intrinsic spectra of these regions .",
    "secondly , images of the extended hard x - ray emission ( e.g. figure [ fig : im_panel ] ) , are clearly not circularly symmetric with the strongest emission in the large - scale regions being seen in the south and west sectors .. this strongly suggests that scattering of nuclear emission by the circularly symmetric psf can not account for all of this emission .",
    "an `` iron line '' image was constructed by taking the 6.3  6.5 kev iron line band and subtracting normalized 5.8  6.3 and 6.5  7.0 kev continuum band images .",
    "the resulting distribution of discrete counts from the iron line extends @xmath67 to the ne and sw , and at lower surface brightness @xmath88 to the west and south .",
    "this agrees well with the hard x - ray flux and iron lines seen in the spectra of the extended and far - extended regions ( figures [ fig : west ]  [ fig : south ] and figure [ fig : far_extended ] ) .    to quantify the effects of scattering by the psf [ sec : psf ] the following approach was used .",
    "four images were constructed in which the central circular region of radius @xmath25 contained the observed distribution of emission in the bands 0.25  0.40 , 1.10  1.90 , 3.56  5.46 and 5.46  7.34 kev . outside this radius ( which corresponds to the inner border of the large - scale regions ) , the emission was set to zero .",
    "these images were then convolved with psfs computed at 0.23 , 1.50 , 3.51 and 6.40 kev respectively , using the ciao tool mkarf . from the convolved images , the predicted count rate per kev due to telescope scattering from the inner bright region",
    "may be obtained for each of the larger scale extended regions .",
    "these are the four horizontal bars plotted in figures [ fig : west ] to [ fig : far_extended ] .",
    "there is clear evidence of an excess of hard x - ray emission from the north and south regions , and tentative evidence from the west , whereas the hard x - ray flux from the east region may have been scattered from the nucleus by the telescope mirrors .",
    "restricting our attention to the more distant regions between @xmath87 ",
    "@xmath53 ( figure [ fig : far_extended ] ) we find there to be evidence of excess hard x - ray emission from the west and south regions , and possibly the north .",
    "spectra containing at least 800 counts were extracted from square regions of the 3.2 s frame - time chandra data , allowing the absorbing column density to each region to be determined .",
    "each spectrum was modeled by an absorbed mekal plasma with variable metal abundance over the energy range 0.25  3.00 kev .",
    "the resulting map of absorbing column density over the face of the galaxy is shown in figure [ fig : column ] .",
    "the sw side of the galaxy shows absorption in excess of the galactic column ( @xmath89 ) , whereas the ne side shows no significant excess absorption .",
    "this result shows that the extended x - ray emission to the ne of the nucleus is on the near side of the galactic disk of ngc 1068 , while that to the sw is either in the galactic disk or on its far side .",
    "this geometrical arrangement agrees with indications from both the high excitation ionized gas seen at optical wavelengths and radio continuum observations .",
    "the ionized gas to the ne is much stronger than that to the sw , a difference usually attributed to excess obscuration on the sw side ( e.g. @xcite 1987 ; @xcite 1991 ) .",
    "further , the ne radio lobe is strongly polarized while that to the sw is unpolarized ( wilson & ulvestad 1983 , hereafter wu ) , consistent with the sw lobe being depolarized by gas in the galaxy disk .",
    "lastly , h i 21 cm absorption observations indicate unambiguously that the ne radio lobe is located in front of the galaxy disk and the sw radio lobe is behind it @xcite .",
    "ngc 1068 contains considerable structure within the central arc second .",
    "there are several radio components arranged in a `` bent linear '' structure ( e.g. wu ; ulvestad , neff & wilson 1987 ; muxlow et al .",
    "1996 ; gallimore et al .",
    "1996 , gallimore , baum & odea 1997 ; roy et al .",
    "there is also structure in optical emission line and continuum images obtained with hst ( e.g. evans et al .",
    "1991 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1994 ) , and in both near- and mid - infrared band images obtained at the diffraction limit of large ground - based telescopes ( e.g. weinberger , neugebauer & matthews 1999 ; bock et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the location of the true nucleus ( meaning the putative black hole and its accretion disk ) has been much discussed .",
    "radio source s1 has a flat or inverted spectrum ( gallimore et al . 1996 ) , which may originate through thermal emission from the inner edge of the obscuring torus ( gallimore , baum & odea 1996 ; roy et al .",
    "vlba imaging ( gallimore , baum & odea 1997 ) shows that this source is a parsec - sized disk of ionized gas .",
    "source s1 is also the location of water maser emission , indicative of dense molecular gas ( claussen & lo 1986 ; greenhill et al . 1996 ) .",
    "to within measurement errors , radio source s1 is coincident with the peaks of mid - infrared ( braatz et al .",
    "1993 ) and near - infrared ( thatte et al .",
    "1997 ) light , and probably with the center of symmetry of the polarization pattern of scattered uv light ( capetti et al .",
    "1995 ; kishimoto 1999 ) .",
    "there is thus a general consensus that these features mark the location of the true nucleus",
    ".    there is , however , no particular reason why the peak of x - ray emission should coincide with this location . the column density , n@xmath90 , to the x - ray nucleus of ngc 1068 exceeds @xmath91 10@xmath92 @xmath93 ( e.g. matt et al . 2000 ) ,",
    "so all of the x - ray emission we observe must be either intrinsically extended or scattered nuclear light .",
    "the chandra astrometry is not currently accurate enough for a precise location of the nucleus with respect to the sub arc - second scale features described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the position of the peak of the broad - band x - ray emission , as measured by the 0.4s frame - time exposure , is : @xmath94(j2000 ) = 02@xmath95 42@xmath96 4071 , @xmath97(j2000 ) = 00@xmath98 00@xmath99 477 .",
    "this position is remarkably close to that of the brightest radio source in the nucleus at 5 ghz ( muxlow et al .",
    "1996 ) : @xmath100(j2000 ) = 02@xmath95 42@xmath96 40715s , @xmath101(j2000 ) = 00@xmath98 00@xmath99 4764 .",
    "the difference in each coordinate is @xmath102 01 .",
    "this agreement is considerably better than expected given chandra s current absolute astrometric errors and may thus be coincidental .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to align the peak in the chandra image with the peak in a 5 ghz radio map with 04 resolution ( wu ) , which is similar to , though somewhat better than , the resolution of the chandra image .",
    "simulations showed that smoothing the 60 mas resolution 5 ghz map of muxlow et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to the 04 resolution of the wu map moves the radio peak slightly to the ne ( by @xmath103 01 in each coordinate ) to : @xmath104(j2000 ) = 02@xmath95 42@xmath96 40721 , @xmath105(j2000 ) = 00@xmath98 00@xmath99 4755 .",
    "this position agrees to @xmath103 01 with the actual position of the peak in the wu map after precessing the original b1950.0 coordinates of that map to j2000.0 using the facility in the ds9 display program .",
    "thus , for purposes of comparison with observations in other wavebands , the peak in the broad - band chandra image was assigned the coordinates @xmath104 , @xmath105 given above . in order to extend the astrometric comparison to optical images",
    ", we used the alignment between the optical and radio emissions obtained by capetti , macchetto & lattanzi ( 1997 ) .",
    "these authors obtained absolute astrometry for the hst images by taking three images : a photographic refractor plate , a ground - based ccd image and an hst image .",
    "the plate covered astrometric standard stars from which astrometric positions were obtained for many fainter , secondary astrometric reference stars some of which are on the ccd image .",
    "finally , the astrometric scale of the hst image was registered to the ground - based ccd image by a cross - correlation technique . from this procedure ,",
    "the location of the peak of emission in the hst optical continuum ( filter f547 m ) image is found to be : @xmath106(j2000 ) = 02@xmath95 42@xmath96 40711 , @xmath107(j2000 ) = 00@xmath98 00@xmath99 4781 ( capetti , macchetto & lattanzi 1997 ) .",
    "this position is also very close to the chandra - measured location of the x - ray peak : @xmath108 ",
    "@xmath106 = 0015 , @xmath109  @xmath107 = 015 , which represents agreement given the chandra errors .",
    "we emphasize that this astrometric registration between the x - ray image on the one hand and the radio and optical images on the other is not precise and may change as the chandra astrometry improves .",
    "however , this uncertainty only affects the alignment on sub arc - second scales , such as is needed to compare the chandra image with hst and radio interferometric data .",
    "spatial comparisons on larger scales ( i.e. @xmath110 1@xmath111 ) are robust . in the following ,",
    "we compare the x - ray morphology with that in the optical line , optical continuum and radio continuum .",
    "figure [ fig : hst_f502n ] shows the x - ray emission ( contours ) superposed on an hst image taken through filter f502n ; this image is dominated by [ o iii ] @xmath1125007 .",
    "there is remarkable agreement between the structures in the two wavebands . to the s of the nucleus ( assumed to be radio source s1 , marked by the cross ) and within 2@xmath111 of it ( figure [ fig : hst_f502n ] , right ) ,",
    "the structure in both wavebands is aligned approximately n - s ( pa @xmath113 13@xmath98 ) and there are detailed correspondences between the two images . to the n of the nucleus , both structures bend towards higher pa , reaching pa @xmath113 35@xmath98 some 4@xmath111 from the nucleus .",
    "it is notable that the bright extension of the x - rays corresponds closely to the bright emission - line clouds which extend from the nucleus to @xmath91 2@xmath111 ne of it ( figure [ fig : hst_f502n ] , right ) .",
    "there is also a close correspondence between the brightnesses slightly further ( 6@xmath111 ) from the nucleus , where the x - ray contours take a v - shaped form , with apex towards the ne ( see also figures [ fig : taurus ] and [ fig : opt ] ) .",
    "correspondences are also seen on the larger scale shown in figure [ fig : hst_f502n ] , left . some 7@xmath111 ne of the nucleus",
    ", there is a prominent narrow feature in the hst image that first extends n and then curves towards the nw , ending up extending in pa @xmath91 287@xmath98 when 10@xmath111 from the nucleus . the x - ray ridge , although observed with lower resolution",
    ", follows this feature closely .",
    "an arm - like feature in the hst image begins some 4@xmath111 se of the nucleus and curves towards lower pa , extending towards the ne and ending up some 6  7 @xmath111 e of the nucleus ; the x - ray contours follow it closely .",
    "various other close correspondences between the faint [ o iii ] and x - ray emission are also visible in figure [ fig : hst_f502n ] , left .",
    "similar correspondences are seen between the x - ray emission and the hst image through filter f658n ( figure [ fig : hst_f658n ] ) , which is dominated by h@xmath23 + [ n ii ] @xmath1146548 , 6583 .",
    "the relative intensities of the various line features are different in this band ( e.g. the narrow feature beginning 7@xmath111 ne is much weaker here than in [ o iii ] ) but there is still a close association between the structures in the two wavebands .    a comparison between [ o iii ] @xmath1125007 and x - ray emission on a larger scale is shown in figure [ fig : taurus ] .",
    "the lower panel shows again the extension from the nucleus to the ne which is common to the two images .",
    "the overall shape of the outer x - ray contours is similar to the [ o iii ] ( top panel ) . to the sw",
    ", there are two spiral arms that curve outwards in a clockwise sense ( i.e. they trail the galactic rotation ) .",
    "the inner , brighter one is some 18@xmath111 and the outer , fainter one some 28@xmath111 from the nucleus . in both cases",
    ", there is a remarkably precise alignment with the x - ray contours ( top panel ) .",
    "the stronger , x - ray point sources are not seen in the [ o iii ] image ; this is not surprising if they are x - ray binaries in ngc 1068 .",
    "figure [ fig : opt ] shows the chandra x - ray contours superposed on a red continuum image ( from pogge & de robertis 1993 ) . features common to both images include a protrusion 7  8@xmath111 sw of the nucleus and , as described in the previous subsection , the two spiral arms sw of the nucleus and the arm - like feature se and e of the nucleus .",
    "however , on the largest scales on which x - ray emission is seen , the x - ray image is much more elongated than the optical . there is little or no x - ray emission seen more than 30@xmath111 from the nucleus in the se or nw directions , while the x - rays extend much further to ne and sw .",
    "the impression gained from these comparisons with optical data is that the x - rays correlate more strongly with the optical line than the optical continuum emission .",
    "this absence of a close correlation between the x - ray and optical continuum images strongly suggests that the starburst disk is not the dominant source of the extended x - ray emission .      as noted in section [ sec : registration ] , radio continuum images with sub arc - second resolution reveal a `` bent linear '' structure extending over 15 .",
    "although the chandra image of the central regions ( e.g. figure [ fig : hst_f502n ] ) does not have good enough resolution for a meaningful comparison , the extension of the x - ray emission immediately to the s of the nucleus is more or less n - s , like the radio emission . north of the nucleus , the x - ray ridge line `` bends '' towards the ne , as does the radio emission .",
    "capetti , macchetto & lattanzi ( 1997 ) show that this arc second - scale radio structure lies in a region of relatively low optical line emission and is surrounded by emission line clouds .",
    "as argued by many authors ( e.g. wilson & willis 1980 ; wilson , ward & haniff 1988 ; evans et al .",
    "1991 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1994 ; gallimore , baum & odea 1996 ) , the structure of the narrow line region implies compression of interstellar gas by the radio ejecta .",
    "thus , given the close association between the x - rays and the narrow line region ( section 5.2 ) , the alignment between the x - rays and the arc second - scale radio structure is expected .",
    "a comparison between the x - ray ( grey scale ) and radio ( contours ) images on a larger scale is shown in figure [ fig : vla ] .",
    "the v - shaped , edge - brightened radio lobe to the ne , which may represent a blast wave driven into the interstellar gas by the radio ejecta ( wilson & ulvestad 1987 ) , is seen to be associated with bright x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray image also exhibits a v - shaped structure with apex some 6@xmath111 from the nucleus ( see also figures [ fig : hst_f502n ] , [ fig : taurus ] ) .",
    "this structure is obviously connected with the radio `` v '' , but has a wider opening angle .",
    "this last difference may result , in part , from the lower resolution of the x - ray image . to the sw of the nucleus , the x - rays are much weaker , consistent with the higher absorbing column to the x - ray emitting gas found here ( section [ sec : column ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the brighter regions of radio emission in the sw lobe do appear to be associated with brighter x - ray emission .",
    "there is little or no enhancement of the x - ray emission at the radio `` hot spot '' 40 sw of the nucleus .",
    "we have obtained the highest resolution ( @xmath115 ) image to date of the x - ray emission of ngc 1068 .",
    "this image shows i ) a bright nucleus close to or coincident with the brightest radio and optical emission , ii ) bright emission extending @xmath1 ( 550 pc ) to the ne , iii ) large - scale structure reaching at least @xmath116 ( 6.6 kpc ) to the ne and sw , including x - ray emission from spiral arms , and iv ) numerous point sources , most of which are likely to be associated with ngc 1068 .",
    "x - ray spectra have been obtained for ten regions  the nucleus , the bright region several arc - seconds to the ne , four @xmath59 sectors between @xmath25 and @xmath117 from the nucleus and four similar sectors between @xmath118 and @xmath117 from the nucleus .",
    "hot plasma models are poor descriptions of the spectra and the best approximations require implausibly low ( @xmath119 ) abundances .",
    "we have constructed models of the spectra comprising two smooth continua ( a bremsstrahlung plus a power - law or two bremsstrahlung spectra ) plus emission lines .",
    "the lines can not be uniquely identified with the present spectral resolution but are generally consistent with the stronger lines seen in the xmm - newton rgs spectrum below 2 kev @xcite . above 2 kev",
    "we observe k@xmath23 transitions of sulfur , argon and iron .",
    "hard x - ray emission , including an iron line , is seen extending @xmath67 ( 2.2 kpc ) ne and sw of the nucleus .",
    "lower surface brightness hard x - ray emission , with a tentatively detected iron line , extends @xmath120 ( 5.5 kpc ) to the west and south . taken together with the xmm - newton rgs spectrum ,",
    "our results suggest photoionization and fluorescence of gas by radiation from the seyfert nucleus to several kilo - parsecs from it .",
    "an investigation of the distribution of absorbing column shows that the emission to the ne of the nucleus is absorbed by only the galactic column and is thus on the near side of the disk of ngc 1068 .",
    "the x - ray emission to the sw of the nucleus suffers greater absorption and must originate in or behind the disk of ngc 1068 .",
    "this geometry agrees with that inferred for both the narrow line region observed at optical wavelengths and the radio ejecta .",
    "we have compared the x - ray image with optical emission - line , optical continuum and radio continuum images .",
    "there is a very strong correlation between the x - ray emission and high excitation optical line emission ( as traced by [ o iii ] @xmath2 ) , consistent with photoionization in both wavebands .",
    "to the sw , the x - ray spiral arms correlate closely with those seen in [ o iii ] @xmath121 .",
    "the ne radio lobe some @xmath122 ( 660 pc ) from the nucleus shows a strong morphological correlation with the x - ray emission , suggestive of interstellar gas being compressed by the radio ejecta .",
    "the alignment of the large - scale ( arc min ) and small scale ( few arc sec ) x - ray emissions and the lack of a close correlation between the larger scale x - ray emission and the optical continuum strongly suggests that the starburst is not the dominant source of these x - rays .",
