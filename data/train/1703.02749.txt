    "affects the system significantly i.e. , when some long past history of the system can influence it s present state , the system dynamics is referred to as non - markovian .",
    "historically , markovian open system dynamics came through optical master equations @xcite .",
    "although any markovian dynamics is known to satisfy the physicality property ( namely , complete positivity ) allowed by quantum mechanics , several of the phenomenological non - markovian dynamics , appeared so far in the literature @xcite , lacks such physicality . as a result of that",
    ", it is important to verify non - markovianity of any open system dynamics before using them anywhere else .    in recent years ,",
    "non - markovianity has been prescribed as a resource for channel discrimination problem  @xcite , preserving coherence  @xcite , controlling work extraction from thermodynamical systems  @xcite , etc .",
    "non - markovian effects also play important roles in areas ranging from fundamental physics of strong fields @xcite to energy transfer process of photosynthetic complexes  @xcite .",
    "recently , researchers are focusing on transition from non - markovian to markovian dynamics as a function of system - bath coupling and bath size @xcite .",
    "some of them have dealt with bosonic bath of infinite or finite degrees of freedom , while using some amount of approximation in defining environment , and some have used qudit system as environment .",
    "but all have considered system - environment interaction to be homogeneous in space and none have addressed the issue of the aforesaid transition in terms of ancilla - sytem entanglement measure .    in our study",
    ", we deal with a simple model where a qubit , acting as a system , interacts with an environment consisting of a few non - interacting qubits .",
    "we vary the coupling strength of the system with different environment - qubits and analyse its effect on non - markovianity of the system dynamics . following the approach by rivas et al .",
    "@xcite , we attach an additional ancilla qubit to the system and set the initial joint state of the system - ancilla as a maximally entangled state .",
    "as the environment interacts with the system , the entanglement between the system and the ancilla begins to decay .",
    "we examine the nature of decay of this entanglement over time . if the decay of entanglement departs from monotonicity the dynamics is non - markovian .",
    "this departure from monotonicity serves as a witness for non - markovianity .",
    "we present three scenarios : ( i ) the system - environment coupling is time - independent but may vary over different environment qubits , ( ii ) the coupling is same for all environment qubits but may vary with time , and ( iii ) the coupling is both time dependent and varies with environment qubits .",
    "we find case ( i ) always gives rise to non - markovian system dynamics .",
    "certain forms of coupling for certain coupling parameter values for case ( ii ) and case ( iii ) , give rise to non - markovian dynamics .",
    "specifically , in case ( ii ) , polynomial forms is always non - markovian and exponential coupling is non - markovian for certain parameter values .",
    "for case ( iii ) we find the extremal values of the coupling parameters which give rise to non - markovianity . beyond those values",
    "the witness fails to capture non - markovianity , if present , and we see these extremal values act as critical values for transition from fully non - markovian to possibly markovian regime .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ hamilevo ] , we first describe our model hamiltonian for the system and environment and initial system - ancilla state . then by diagonalizing the hamiltonian we find out the evolution operator , thereby finding the time - evolved state of the system . in section [ evolut ] , characterization of non - markovianity is given and then a description of our witness is presented .",
    "we present different scenarios for different forms of the coupling . in subsection [ simtech ]",
    ", we also give a description of the simulation technique .",
    "finally in section [ conclu ] , we draw our conclusions .    .",
    "the system is interacting with an environment , consisting of finite number of qubits.,height=4 ]",
    "in our model both the system and the ancilla consists of qubits having joint hilbert space @xmath1 and their initial state is the maximally entangled state @xmath2 the environment consists of @xmath3 number of non - interacting qubits [ see figure  [ fig10 ] ] .",
    "the system - environment interaction hamiltonian , acting on the hilbert space @xmath4 , may be time - dependent in general is chosen in the form , @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where coupling strength @xmath6 is in general time - dependent and site - dependent , and @xmath7 is a real parameter that scales with the interaction strength .",
    "so , although a toy model , it depicts a physical scenario where a two - level system releases an energy quantum that excites the @xmath8th ( @xmath9 ) qubit of the environment which is in the ground state .",
    "the reverse phenomenon happens when a quantum of energy is released by an exited qubit of the environment provided all other environment qubits are in the ground state . the strength @xmath10 of the coupling that causes this exchange , changes with environment site @xmath8 and also with time @xmath11 .",

    "the ancilla qubit is not going through any kind of direct evolution , i.e. , there is no self hamiltonian acting on the ancilla .",
    "similarly , neither the system nor the environment have any free hamiltonian .",
    "thus we can assume that individual strengths of their free evolution are quite small compared to that of the interaction , hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "the initial state of the environment is given by the following thermal state of @xmath3 qubits @xmath36^{\\otimes n},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a positive real parameter which can be identified with inverse of temperature ( defined as the temperature of the thermal state ) of the environment .",

    "we present here a brief description of markovian and non - markovian processes .",

    "there has been generalization for continuous time stochastic processes and the idea of markovianity for such processes is already a well known notion @xcite .",
    "it is , in general , difficult to make a direct generalization of classical markovian processes into quantum markovian processes .",
    "the approach we take here is to define markovianity in terms of divisibility of a dynamical process . a dynamical process given by trace preserving super - operator @xmath47 representing an evolution from time @xmath48 to @xmath49",
    "is said to be markovian or divisible if , @xmath50 is a completely positive map and the following composition law  @xcite is obeyed @xmath51 for any @xmath52 . here @xmath53 denotes composition .    following this definition of markovianity , rivas et al .",
    "@xcite devised a measure of non - markovianity , where a connection between system - ancilla entanglement decay and non - markovianity was used .",
    "the degree of deviation from monotonicity of the entanglement decay curve was taken as the measure of non - markovianity .",
    "evidently , this idea can be easily extended to define a non - markovianity witness .",
    "we say that non - markovianity has been witnessed whenever the entanglement decay curve shows a departure from monotonicity .    to calculate the entanglement between system qubit and ancilla qubit we use the peres - horodecki s necessary and sufficient criterion @xcite for two - qubit entangled state .",
    "we take partial transposition of @xmath54 with respect to the system , @xmath55^{t_s}. $ ] the only negative eigenvalue @xmath56 @xcite , if any , of @xmath55^{t_s } $ ] quantifies the entanglement .",
    "we will use the modulus of this negative eigenvalue @xmath57 as a measure of entanglement and if all the eigenvalues are positive semidefinite we will consider entanglement measure to be zero .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the case when the coupling coefficients @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) is any arbitrary function of site @xmath8 and independent of time .",
    "physical systems like solid state lattices may exhibit this type of coupling .",
    "hence @xmath58 in eq . ( [ nonzeroeigen ] )",
    "are constants in time .",
    "also the hamiltonian operators in eq .",

    "hence @xmath65 serves as a measure of entanglement in @xmath54 .",
    "we define the entanglement measure for @xmath54 as @xmath66    we see that @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ consenta ] ) is periodic as well as continuous in @xmath11 .",
    "also @xmath68 .",
    "so if @xmath69 is the time period of the function @xmath67 , then @xmath70 .",
    "this clearly shows that , the negative values of @xmath67 varies with time in a non - monotonic manner .",
    "thus , for any non - zero @xmath71 , the decay in @xmath72 departs from monotonicity .",
    "this holds true irrespective of values of @xmath73 and @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the fall of @xmath72 with time .",
    "this departure from monotonicity is the witness of non - markovianity considered in this paper and it clearly shows that the system dynamics is non - markovian . from the functional form in ( [ nonzeroeigen ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that on increasing number of particles in the environment , frequency of this oscillation increases .",
    "so we can expect an increase in non - markovian nature when the number of qubits in the environmentis increases .",
    "a numerical simulation of the above analysis was also done .",
    "starting from numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) we found the negative eigenvalue of @xmath74^{t_s}$ ] . on plotting @xmath72 with time , we found in figure [ fig1 ] a plot which matches exactly with the aforesaid theoretically obtained plot .",
    "when , the coupling function @xmath75 in expression ( [ hamil ] ) , is independent of site @xmath8 and is given by an",
    "_ arbitrary _ function of time [ @xmath76 say ] , the hamiltonians mutually commute at different times , and the analysis is same as in the last section . the only difference comes from the fact that @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ nonzeroeigen ] ) are no longer constant . thus in the expression of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eigneg ] ) , @xmath78 is replaced by a term    @xmath79    if @xmath80 is some polynomial function of @xmath11 , we will get @xmath81 as a polynomial function of t. from the analysis in the last section we can see that , this will also give rise to a continuous and periodic @xmath67 and @xmath68 . hence the dynamics will again be non - markovian . if @xmath82 we have a possibility of getting markovianity when real part of @xmath83 . when @xmath84 is negative we can see , as in the previous case , the dynamics is surely non - markovian . when @xmath84 is positive non - markovianity is witnessed if @xmath85 .    ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this case in discussed in section [ subsec1].,height=6 ]      when @xmath10 is both dependent on site @xmath8 and time @xmath11 , the hamiltonian at different times do nt commute with each other . in this scenario , solving for @xmath54 becomes analytically quite difficult .",
    "so , we simulate the dynamics numerically .",
    "note that this type of coupling represents situations where the environment particles are in a relative motion with respect to the system .",
    "we first find out all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "there are two non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are given in eq .",
    "( [ non - zero ] ) .",
    "( @xmath88 ) of the rest of the eigenvectors ( corresponding to zero eigenvalues ) in the subspace spanned by @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 are found by row reduction and gram - schmidt orthonormalization techniques .",
    "the remaining ( @xmath93 ) eigenvectors with zero eigenvalue are given in section [ hamilevo ] .",
    "note that all the eigenvectors are time - dependent .",
    "the unitary operator giving rise to the evolution was found by the expression in eq .",
    "( [ unitaryform ] ) .",
    "once that is done , we evolve the initial ancilla -system - environment state @xmath94 by the unitary matrix @xmath95 and get the time evolved state .",
    "the reduced state of system - ancilla is then used to find out the residual entanglement measure . as a verification of this technique",
    "we plot the decay of system - ancilla entanglement as a function of time for case i ( section [ subsec1 ] ) and it is seen that it perfectly matches with the theoretically obtained result .      here",
    "we will consider , @xmath97 , @xmath96 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) and @xmath98 in the initial environment state ( [ rhoe ] ) .",
    "we plot here the ancilla - system entanglement measure @xmath72 as a function of time for different values of the coupling parameter @xmath99 at a fixed value of @xmath3 ( number of qubits present in the environment ) . in figure [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ]",
    ", monotonically decreasing entanglement values show signs of _ possible _ markovianity of the system - environment dynamics and non - monotonic nature of entanglement decay are evidence of non - markovianity .",
    "the figures clearly depict that after some time , the entanglement saturates to fixed values irrespective of their markovian or non - markovian nature . as expected ,",
    "increasing the coupling parameter",
    "@xmath100 i.e. , decreasing coupling strength , leads to the transition from non - markovian to possible markovian dynamics .",
    "next we find the extremal values of @xmath101 for which non - markovianity can be witnessed .",
    "these extremal values serve as transition parameters from non - markovianity to possible markovianity .",
    "on plotting these transition values with @xmath3 ( see figure ( [ trans ] ) ) it appears that a saturation is reached as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "we take the coupling function @xmath10 in the above form and @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "as shown in figure ( [ tng ] ) the dynamics is non - markovian .",
    "in this paper , we addressed the question of how non - markovianity of a dynamics changes with the interaction between the system and the environment .",
    "we have taken a toy model constituting of a few qubits .",
    "but even in this minimalistic scenario , we are able to find a transition from non - markovian to possible markovian dynamics by tuning the system - environment interaction",
    ". we also found that if the interaction is independent of time , the dynamics is always non - markovian . in the case of site - independent interaction , polynomial forms and certain cases of exponential forms",
    "show non - markovianity .",
    "lastly , we study time - dependent and site - dependent interaction for certain forms of system - environment coupling . in this last case , we saw the transition from non - markovianity to possible markovianity .",
    "the transition values appear to saturate for larger numbers of environment qubits . examining this type of spin environment is recently drawing some amount of interest  @xcite . studies on similar lines",
    "was also done recently in @xcite , where an analysis of a qubit system interacting with a sea of spins was given .",
    "a number of questions arise from this study : whether such a transition can be found by considering more general forms of interaction , what happens if along with system - environment interaction , there is some interaction present among the environment particles , themselves .",
    "one may also find it useful to check , if the saturation of transition parameters , a general feature of interaction that exhibits non - markovian to markovian transition .",
