    "what is gravity ? are there additional spacetime dimensions",
    "? these are among the eleven science questions for the new century identified by the committee on the physics of the universe , us national research council @xcite .",
    "interestingly , despite the fact that gravity is the first force discovered in nature , the quest to unify it with other fundamental forces remains elusive because of its apparent weakness at short - distance , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in developing grand unification theories ,",
    "the conventional inverse - square - law ( isl ) of newtonian gravitational force has to be modified due to either the geometrical effect of the extra spacetime dimensions predicted by string theories and/or the exchange of weakly interacting bosons , such as the neutral spin-1 vector @xmath1-boson @xcite , proposed in the super - symmetric extension of the standard model , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the modified gravity has also been proposed as an explanation for the present period of cosmological acceleration , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "the search for evidence of modified gravity is at the forefront of research in several sub - fields of natural sciences including geophysics , nuclear and particle physics , as well as astrophysics and cosmology , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite . various upper limits on the deviation from the isl has been put forward down to femtometer range . since the composition of neutron stars are determined mainly by the weak and electromagnetic forces through the @xmath2 equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions while their stability is maintained by the balance of strong and gravitational forces , neutron stars are thus a natural testing ground of grand unification theories of fundamental forces .",
    "moreover , neutron stars are among the densest objects with the strongest gravity in the universe , making them ideal places to test strong - field predictions of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite . the masses and radii of neutron stars",
    "are solely determined by both the strong - field behavior of gravity and the equation of state ( eos ) of dense stellar matter . however , there is no fundamental reason to choose einstein s equations over other alternatives and it is known that the gr theory itself may break down at the limit of very strong gravitational fields , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review .",
    "in fact , effects of modified gravity on properties of neutron stars have been under intense investigation .",
    "as expected , results of these studies are strongly model dependent , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "nevertheless , it is very interesting to note that alternative gravity theories that have all passed low - field tests but diverge from gr in the strong - field regime predict neutron stars with significantly different properties than their gr counterparts @xcite .",
    "moreover , the deviations for neutron star properties from the gr predictions for these theories are larger than the uncertainty due to the poorly known eos of dense matter in neutron stars .",
    "it was also clearly shown that the neutron star maximum mass alone can not distinguish gravity theories @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the endeavor of testing gr theory of gravity using properties of neutron stars , it is known that there is a degeneracy between the matter content and gravity .",
    "this degeneracy is tied to the fundamental strong equivalence principle and can only be broken by using at least two independent observables @xcite .",
    "recently , using the general relativistic shapiro delay the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 was precisely measured to be @xmath0@xcite , making it the new holder of the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "comparing with mass - radius relations predicted from solving the tov equation using various eoss within gr theory of gravity , it was shown that the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 can rule out almost all soft eoss especially those associated with hyperon or boson condensation . while conventional quark stars with soft eoss",
    "are also ruled out by this observation , neutron stars with strongly interacting quark cores are allowed @xcite .",
    "it was further shown that a transition to quark matter in neutron star cores can occur at densities comparable to the nuclear saturation density @xmath3 only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are color superconducting @xcite .",
    "the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 was then used to constrain the interacting parameters of quarks .",
    "it was also shown that neutron stars with interacting quark clusters in their cores or solid quark stars can be very massive . using the lennard - jones potential for interactions between quark clusters ,",
    "the mass of the psr j1614 - 2230 was used to constrain the number of quarks inside individual quark clusters @xcite . in this work , using soft nuclear eoss for hybrid stars containing a quark core described by the mit bag model with reasonable parameters , we show that the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 is readily obtained by incorporating a yukawa gravitational correction that is consistent with existing constraints from terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments .",
    "fujii @xcite first proposed that the non - newtonian gravity can be described by adding a yukawa term to the conventional gravitational potential between two objects of mass @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a dimensionless strength parameter , @xmath8 is the length scale and @xmath9 is the gravitational constant . in the boson exchange picture ,",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for scalar / vector bosons and @xmath12 ( in natural units ) .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the boson - baryon coupling constant and the boson mass , respectively .",
    "the light and weakly interacting @xmath1-boson is a favorite candidate mediating the extra interaction @xcite .",
    "similar to the degeneracy between matter content and gravity , there appears to be a duality of incorporating effects of the yukawa term in either the tov equation or the input eos .",
    "nevertheless , according to fujii @xcite , the yukawa term is simply part of the matter system in general relativity .",
    "therefore , only the eos is modified and the tov equation remains the same . within the mean - field approximation , the extra energy density due to the yukawa term is @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the normalization volume , @xmath17 is the baryon number density and @xmath18 . assuming a constant boson mass independent of the density , one obtains the corresponding addition to the eos @xmath19 , which is just equal to the additional energy density .",
    "as it was emphasized by fujii @xcite , since the new vector boson contributes to the eos only through the combination @xmath20 , while both the coupling constant g and the mass @xmath14 of the light and weakly interacting bosons are small , the value of @xmath20 can be large . on the other hand , by comparing with the @xmath20 value of the ordinary vector boson @xmath21 , krivoruchenko et al .",
    "have pointed out that as long as the @xmath20 value of the u boson is less than about 200 gev@xmath22 the internal structures of both finite nuclei and neutron stars will not change @xcite .",
    "however , global properties of neutron stars can be significantly modified @xcite one of the key characteristics of the yukawa correction is its composition dependence , unlike einstein s gravity .",
    "thus , ideally one needs to use different coupling constants for various baryons existing in neutron stars .",
    "moreover , to our best knowledge , it is unknown if there is any and what might be the form and strength of the yukawa term in the hadron - quark mixed phase and the pure quark phase .",
    "nevertheless , instead of introducing more parameters , for the purpose of this exploratory study , we assume that the @xmath23 term is an effective yukawa correction existing in all phases with the @xmath24 considered as an averaged coupling constant .",
    "( color online ) model eoss for hybrid stars with and without the yukawa contribution using mit bag constant @xmath25=170 mev and @xmath25=180 mev , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    including the yukawa term the eos becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the conventional pressure inside neutron stars .",
    "for the latter , we use typical model eoss for hybrid stars containing a quark core covered by hyperons and leptons .",
    "the quark matter is described by the mit bag model with reasonable parameters widely used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the hyperonic eos is modelled by using an extended isospin- and momentum - dependent effective interaction ( mdi @xcite ) for the baryon octet with parameters constrained by empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter , hyper - atoms , and heavy - ion reactions @xcite . in particular , the underlying eos of symmetric nuclear matter is constrained by comparing transport model predictions with data on collective flow and kaon production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath28 with this interaction is chosen to increase approximately linearly with density ( i.e. , the mdi interaction with a symmetry energy parameter x=0 @xcite ) in agreement with available constraints around and below the saturation density @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this @xmath28 is very similar to the well - known apr prediction up to about @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the gibbs construction was adopted to describe the hadron - quark phase transition @xcite .",
    "similar to the previous work in the literature , the hybrid star is divided into the liquid core , inner crust and outer crust from the center to surface .",
    "for the inner crust , a parameterized eos of @xmath30 is adopted as in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the outer crust ,",
    "the bps eos  @xcite is adopted . as an example , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are the eoss for hybrid stars with mit bag constant @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 mev , respectively , with and without the yukawa contribution .",
    "the corresponding hadron - quark mixed phase above / below the pure hadron / quark phase covers the density range of @xmath33 to 6.56 and @xmath34 to 8.63 , respectively . including the yukawa term the eos stiffens as the value of @xmath20 increases .",
    "it is seen that the two sets of parameters , @xmath31 mev and @xmath35 50  gev@xmath22 or @xmath32 mev and @xmath35 40  gev@xmath22 , lead to approximately the same total pressure . as a reference",
    ", the mdi eos for the @xmath36 matter is also shown .",

    "[ fig2 ] is the mass - radius relation of hybrid stars with the bag constant @xmath25=170 mev and varying values of @xmath20 .",
    "first of all , without the yukawa contribution ( black solid line ) the maximum stellar mass supported is only about @xmath37 . including the yukawa term , as the eoss are increasingly stiffened with larger values of @xmath20 , the maximum stellar mass increases . with @xmath38",
    "gev@xmath22 the maximum mass of @xmath39 is just in the middle of the measured mass band of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "the corresponding radius is about 12.4 km . to see more clearly relative effects of the bag constant b and the yukawa term , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are the maximum stellar masses as a function of @xmath20 with @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 mev , respectively .",
    "as expected , with @xmath32 mev a smaller value of @xmath40gev@xmath22 is needed to obtain a maximum mass consistent with the observed mass of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "( color online ) constraints on the strength and range of the yukawa term from terrestrial nuclear experiments in comparison with @xmath41.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as mentioned earlier , significant efforts have been devoted to constrain the possible non - newtonian gravity using terrestrial experiments .",
    "these experiments have established a clear trend of increased strength @xmath7 at shorter length @xmath8 . in the short range down to @xmath42 m , neutron - proton and neutron - lead scattering data as well as the spectroscopy of antiproton atoms have been used to set upper limits on the value of @xmath20 ( or equivalently the @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to compare the values of @xmath20 necessary to support the psr j1614 - 2230 within the model presented above with the constraints extracted from terrestrial experiments . while the range parameter @xmath8 is expected to be much larger ( smaller ) than the radii of finite nuclei ( neutron stars ) , the maximum mass of neutron stars alone is not sufficient to set separate constraints on the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is a comparison with the terrestrial constraints @xcite in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "the straight line is for @xmath44  gev@xmath22 .",
    "it is seen that the values of @xmath20 necessary to describe the maximum mass of psr j1614 - 2230 are consistent with the upper limits from the terrestrial experiments .",
    "among all fundamental forces , gravity remains the most uncertain one despite being the first discovered in nature .",
    "neutron stars are natural testing grounds of grand unification theories of fundamental forces .",
    "in particular , they are ideal places to test gr predictions at the strong - field limit . interpretations of observed properties of neutron stars require a comprehensive understanding of both gravity and the eos of dense stellar matter . before strong - field gravity is well understood , it is unlikely that the maximum mass of neutron stars alone can rule out any eos . as an example , using soft nuclear eoss consistent with existing terrestrial experiments for hybrid stars containing a quark core described by the mit bag model with reasonable parameters , the maximum mass of psr j1614 - 2230 is readily obtained by incorporating the yukawa gravitational correction that is consistent with existing constraints from terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments .",
