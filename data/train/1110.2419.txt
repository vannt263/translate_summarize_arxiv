    "currently uncertainties in parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at large parton momentum fractions @xmath6 represent one of the main impediments to the determination of the longitudinal structure of the nucleon in terms of its fundamental constituents .",
    "the large-@xmath6 region provides a unique opportunity for studying the flavor and spin dynamics of quarks in the nucleon , with the @xmath3 quark distribution ratio in particular being very sensitive to different mechanisms of spin - flavor symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "knowledge of pdfs at large @xmath6 is important also for several other reasons , such as the reliable calculation of qcd backgrounds in new physics searches at hadron colliders , especially at large rapidities , as well as in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the systematics of uncertainties in parton distributions at large @xmath6 has been the focus of recent dedicated global qcd analyses by the cteq - jefferson lab ( cj ) collaboration @xcite , which investigated the sensitivity of pdfs to different treatments of nuclear corrections in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) from deuterium .",
    "while proton dis data place strong constraints on the @xmath7-quark distribution , neutron structure functions are needed in order to determine also the @xmath8-quark pdf .",
    "the absence of free neutron targets , however , means that deuterium dis data must be used to infer information about the structure of the free neutron .",
    "uncertainties in the nuclear corrections in the deuteron , such as those associated with nucleon off - shell effects and the large - momentum components of the deuteron wave function , give rise to significant uncertainties in the resulting @xmath3 ratio for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this prevents drawing any firm conclusions about the @xmath10 behavior of @xmath3 predicted in various nonperturbative and perturbative models , which range from 0 in models with scalar diquark dominance @xcite to @xmath11 in models with admixtures of axial - vector diquarks @xcite or those based on helicity conservation @xcite , and up to 0.5 in models with su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry @xcite .    a recent analysis of the strength of the emc effect in nuclei and data on inclusive electron  nucleus scattering at @xmath1 proposed a phenomenological , theory - independent , determination of the neutron to proton structure function ratio @xmath0 , known as the `` in - medium correction '' ( imc ) extraction @xcite .",
    "the imc analysis is based on the observed correlation between the strength of the nuclear emc effect at intermediate @xmath6 ( @xmath12 ) and the number of short range correlated nucleon ",
    "nucleon pairs in light , medium , and heavy nuclei , which is then extrapolated to a free nucleon .    in this report",
    "we combine the phenomenology of these two approaches , and illustrate how the imc extracted neutron structure function can in principle limit the range of parameters describing nuclear corrections in the deuteron , thereby significantly reducing the uncertainties in the resulting @xmath3 ratio at large @xmath6 .",
    "as we shall see , the imc analysis favors values of @xmath3 at the upper end of the uncertainty band obtained in the cj global qcd fit @xcite , indicating the presence of significant nucleon off - shell corrections in the deuteron structure function .",
    "in the conventional description of dis from the deuteron at @xmath13 , the scattering is assumed to take place incoherently from individual nucleons in the deuterium nucleus @xcite . in the weak binding approximation ( wba ) , the deuteron structure function can be written as a convolution of the bound nucleon structure functions @xmath14 and a momentum distribution function of nucleons in the deuteron ( also known as the `` smearing function '' ) @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , kulagin and petti used a simple quark spectral model to obtain a physically motivated parametrization of the nucleon off - shell corrections ( see also refs .",
    "the off - shell corrections were estimated by integrating the quark ",
    "nucleon spectral function over quark virtualities up to some high - momentum scale @xmath15 that depends on the nucleon off - shell mass @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the nucleon energy and @xmath18 its momentum , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the nucleon and deuteron masses .",
    "taking @xmath15 to be inversely proportional to the quark confinement radius @xmath21 in the nucleon , its dependence on @xmath22 can be related to the change in the size of the nucleon in the nuclear medium ( `` nucleon swelling '' ) .",
    "the change of scale @xmath23 and nucleon virtuality can be conveniently parametrized in terms of a single parameter @xmath24 , given by @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the average nucleon virtuality ( @xmath27 ) in the deuteron .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 was chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite to reproduce the phenomenological values of the change of confinement radius from the study of the nuclear emc effect in the @xmath28-rescaling model @xcite , @xmath29 .",
    "this was somewhat smaller than the nuclear - averaged value of @xmath30 obtained by fitting the off - shell correction to ratios of nuclear structure functions for a range of nuclei @xcite .",
    "while it is generally accepted that some off - shell corrections to the convolution approximation are needed in order to describe nuclear structure functions at large @xmath6 @xcite , their magnitude varies considerably between different models @xcite , and on the definition of the smearing function .",
    "( in fact , in some approaches such as the light - front @xcite explicit off - mass - shell corrections do not appear at all , their effects instead being subsumed by higher fock state components or contact interactions . )    in the present analysis we treat @xmath24 as a free parameter , allowing it to be determined by the imc extraction data for a given virtuality @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is computed from several modern deuteron wave functions which give high - precision fits to nucleon - nucleon scattering data , namely , the cd - bonn @xcite , av18 @xcite , and the relativistic wjc-1 and wjc-2 wave functions @xcite , yielding values of the nucleon virtuality of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "( the older paris deuteron wave function @xcite gives a value @xmath33 , similar to the av18 model . ) this `` modified kulagin - petti '' ( mkp ) parametrization of the off - shell corrections ( [ eq : lambda ] ) allows a wide range of models to be assessed in terms of a single parameter , the nucleon swelling @xmath34 , for a given deuteron wave function .",
    "from the cj global qcd fit @xcite assuming different deuteron wave functions : cd - bonn ( red ) , av18 ( black ) , wjc-1 ( green ) and wjc-2 ( blue ) .",
    "the curves correspond to different nucleon swelling levels , @xmath34 , ranging from 0% ( lowest curves ) to 3% ( highest curves ) in steps of 0.3% .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : npratio ] the ratio of neutron to proton structure functions @xmath0 at @xmath35  gev@xmath36 is shown for various deuteron wave functions and swelling levels @xmath34 , ranging from 0% to 3% , in increments of 0.3% , using the wba smearing function and the mkp off - shell model .",
    "for each combination of wave function and swelling parameters , the structure functions are computed from the cj global next - to - leading order qcd fit of pdfs as described in ref .",

    "@xcite , by allowing the changes in the nuclear corrections to the deuteron @xmath38 structure function to be compensated by corresponding changes in the @xmath8-quark pdf ( inducing a similar change in the calculated neutron @xmath2 ) .",
    "the curves are compared with the @xmath0 ratios obtained from the imc extraction over the range @xmath39 .",
    "to constrain the nuclear correction uncertainty in @xmath0 , we calculate the @xmath40 of the imc data for each deuteron wave function and swelling combination .",

    "the choice of confidence level ( c.  l. ) we treat the deuteron wave function as a ( discrete ) parameter , and consider a 90% c.  l. for two free parameters , corresponding to an increase in @xmath40 of 4.61 above the minimum . with this c.  l.",
    "the imc extraction constrains the swelling levels to the range @xmath41 , with a preference for the cd - bonn , av18 and wjc-2 wave functions .",
    "the minimum @xmath40 occurs for the cd - bonn model at @xmath42 .",
    "the minimum @xmath40 for the wjc-1 wave function at @xmath43 lies outside of the 90% c.  l. and is disfavored by the imc data .",
    "the implications of these constraints for the @xmath3 ratio in the limit @xmath10 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ]  ( right ) , where the @xmath40 is shown as a function of the limiting @xmath3 value of each pdf fit .",
    "the imc extraction yields a @xmath3 limiting value of @xmath5 at the 90% c.  l.",
    "( at the 99% c.  l. , using a @xmath40 increase of 9.21 , the uncertainty would increase to @xmath44 ) .",
    "these results strongly disfavor the su(6 ) value @xmath45 , as well as the @xmath46 limit predicted in models with scalar diquark dominance .",
    "furthermore , global pdf analyses often assume the same functional @xmath6 dependence for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 quark distributions , forcing the @xmath3 ratio to approach either zero or infinity in the @xmath10 limit .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : chi2 ] , however , suggest that a more flexible parametrization for the @xmath3 ratio , which allows finite @xmath10 limits , may be more realistic @xcite .",

    "[ fig : duratio ] , including the full theoretical uncertainty from the cj global fit @xcite , and the 90% c.  l. extracted from the imc constraints .",
    "even though the imc extraction only covers an @xmath6 range of @xmath47 , it nevertheless imposes a tight constraint on the @xmath3 parton distributions ratio for @xmath10 .",
    "within a global pdf analysis we have studied the constraints imposed by the theory - independent imc - extracted @xmath2 structure function data on nuclear corrections in deuterium . these phenomenologically extracted data strongly support the presence of off - shell modifications of nucleons in the deuteron , and constrain their magnitude to a more limited range than in the recent cj global qcd analysis without the imc data @xcite .",
    "the imc data also disfavor deuterium wave functions with very `` hard '' momentum distributions , such as for the nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite , which produce a shallow emc ratio @xmath48 at intermediate and large @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath7-quark pdf is well constrained by the proton dis data , the lack of a free neutron target makes the @xmath8-quark distribution very sensitive to the assumptions used to calculate the nuclear correction in the deuteron .",
    "the use of the imc - extracted neutron structure function directly constrains the @xmath8-quark pdf for @xmath49 , and indirectly for @xmath10 .",
    "we find the @xmath3 ratio in the limit @xmath10 to be @xmath5 at the 90% confidence level , in agreement with models predicting intermediate values of @xmath3 between the su(6 ) symmetry and scalar diquark dominance limits @xcite .",
    "of course , these conclusions strongly depend on the assumptions underlying the imc extraction of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "some of these are being tested through the study of dis events with a tagged high - momentum proton recoil at jefferson lab @xcite , and will be the subject of a similar experiment at the future 12  gev upgraded facility @xcite . the ultimate arbiter , however , will be data on free or nearly free neutron targets , such as from the bonus experiment @xcite at jefferson lab that collected dis data up to @xmath50 , or its future 12  gev extension @xcite that will reach @xmath51 .",
    "further avenues to direct experimental constraints on @xmath3 at large @xmath6 include the 12  gev marathon experiment @xcite at jefferson lab on dis from the @xmath52he@xmath52he mirror nuclei and the parity - violating dis program on a hydrogen target @xcite , as well as the measurement of @xmath53 boson asymmetries at large rapidities in @xmath54 collisions at the tevatron or in @xmath55 scattering at rhic and the lhc @xcite .",
