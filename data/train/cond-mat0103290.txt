    "exciton - exciton annihilation is an important process that strongly influences the optical and opto - electronic properties of materials at high excitation densities . in particular",
    ", exciton - exciton annihilation affects the nonlinear and lasing properties of organic systems , such as j - aggregates and polymer films .",
    "@xcite though the importance of this process is well - recognized , the microscopic understanding of the annihilation kinetics is still rather poor .",
    "this holds especially under the conditions of strong exciton delocalization and ( or ) low temperature , where the usual bi - molecular theory of exciton - exciton annihilation is expected to break down .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the annihilation kinetics in weakly disordered one - dimensional frenkel exciton systems , where the exciton coherence size can be considerable ( tens of lattice units ) .",
    "this study is of relevance to the optical properties and exciton dynamics in j - aggregates and molecular antenna systems .",
    "the standard approach to describe the kinetics of exciton - exciton annihilation relies on the bi - molecular rate equation , in which it is assumed that the effective annihilation rate is proportional to the exciton density .",
    "this equation reads   @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the average exciton density , understood here as the number of excitations per molecule , @xmath2 is the single - excitation ( radiative and non - radiative ) relaxation rate , and @xmath3 is the co - called annihilation constant having here the dimension of 1/time",
    ". the effective rate of exciton - exciton annihilation in the system is then indeed proportional to the average exciton density @xmath1 and is given by @xmath4 .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ bme ] ) reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the initial population of excitations . if the annihilation dominates the single - exciton relaxation ( @xmath7 ) the excitation population decreases according to a hyperbolic ( non - exponential ) law @xmath8    the typical picture that one commonly has in mind when modeling the annihilation process as is done in eq .",
    "( [ bme ] ) , is as follows .",
    "first , it is usually understood that , as a result of strong disorder and ( or ) high temperature , the frenkel excitons represent , in fact , molecular excitations .",
    "next , it is assumed that the excitations ( diffusively ) move over the system . if the diffusion rate is large compared to the rate of nearest - neighbor annihilation , denoted by @xmath9 , two excitations annihilate each other ( by fusing into one high - lying molecular excitation that quickly loses its energy by vibrational relaxation ) when they have reached neighboring molecules . in this case @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath9 dominates the diffusion rate , the annihilation event may occur at a distance large compared to the the nearest - neighbor separation . in this case , the annihilation constant is determined by a convolution of the annihilation rate with the pair correlation function of two excitations ,  @xcite and may in principle depend on time .",
    "the bi - molecular rate description has limitations , which become rather important at low temperatures . obviously",
    ", the bi - molecular approach does not account for the fact that the excitons in j - aggregates are generally quite strongly spread , with typical coherence lengths of several tens of molecules .   even at room temperature ,",
    "this length is of the order of 10 molecules ,  @xcite owing to the large inter - molecular excitation transfer interaction in these systems .",
    "it is an open and interesting question whether this finite length may be accounted for by interpreting @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ bme ] ) as an effective annihilation constant . in this paper",
    ", we will address this question for low - temperature exciton systems .",
    "we will study the kinetics of exciton - exciton annihilation of one - dimensional excitons that are weakly localized by static disorder .",
    "we will use the same framework as was done in refs .   to calculate annihilation rates .",
    "the new element of the present paper is to use these rates to follow the kinetics of annihilation .",
    "an important step in describing the annihilation of extended excitons , is to distinguish between inter- and intra - segment annihilation .",
    "@xcite the rationale for this distinction is as follows .",
    "as appears from numerical simulations of disordered exciton chains , the exciton states residing close to the bottom of the exciton band ( the region that dominates the optical response ) can be classified into groups of a few ( two or three ) states .",
    "the states within each separate group are all localized on the same segment of the aggregate , with a typical size @xmath11 ( often referred to as the number of coherently bound molecules ) , while the segments corresponding to different groups do not overlap .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the two or three exciton states within each such group are very similar in structure and energy to the lowest two or three states that exists on an ordered chain of length @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite in particular , the lowest state of such a group has a wave function spread over the segment without nodes and can be interpreted as the local ground state .",
    "the next higher lying state of the group has a well - defined node and looks like a first local excited state , etc .",
    "the energy difference of the local ground and first excited states agrees well with that of a perfect chain of length @xmath11 .",
    "obviously , to describe exciton - exciton annihilation , one should consider at least the two - exciton states .",
    "as is well known , one - dimensional frenkel excitons are weakly interacting fermions ( see refs .  ) .",
    "thus , the wave functions of states with two excitons can be composed of slater determinants of two one - exciton wave functions . under the condition of weak localization ,",
    "two different types of two - exciton states then appear : ( i ) those with two excitons belonging to the same localization segment , and ( ii ) those with the two excitons localized on different segments .",
    "this immediately leads to the distinction of intra - segment and inter - segment annihilation as fundamentally different annihilation channel .",
    "@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present our microscopic model of annihilation , express the annihilation rate in terms of the basic interactions and wave functions , and make the formal step towards the annihilation kinetics at low temperatures , where the diffusive motion of excitons towards each other may be neglected . in sec .",
    "[ qualit ] we use the distinction between inter- and intra - segment annihilation to derive qualitatively analytical expressions for the low - temperature annihilation kinetics .",
    "a more detailed study is presented in sec .",
    "[ simul ] , where we basically exactly solve the kinetics , formally defined in sec .",
    "[ model ] , through numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "[ summ ] we summarize our findings and discuss the relevance to experimental low - temperature annihilation data .",
    "under usual experimental conditions , only a small part of the localization segments on molecular aggregates are excited .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .   estimated that in their experiments , one hundred molecules per aggregate were produced at the highest excitation power applied ( @xmath12 ) . as a physical aggregate normally consists of @xmath13 molecules ,",
    "@xcite while the typical localization segment in their particular case counted 20 molecules , these authors concluded that less than one exciton was created per segment of localization ( on average , one exciton per five segments ) .",
    "a simple consideration based on the poisson distribution for the probability of finding an integer number of excitons per segment , shows that on the physical aggregate about 80 out of 500 segments are expected to be singly excited , while only 8 are doubly excited .",
    "triply ( and more ) excited segments are almost absent .",
    "bearing in mind that excitons , created on the same segment of an aggregate or on closely spaced separate segments , will annihilate first , we conclude that a two - exciton model of annihilation seems to be quite reasonable as a first step .      as a working model",
    ", we adopt a linear chain of @xmath14 three - level molecules as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "@xcite the two lower molecular states , denoted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , are assumed to form an exciton band , as a result of a sufficiently strong resonant dipole - dipole inter - molecular coupling .",
    "the corresponding exciton hamiltonian , taken in the nearest - neighbor approximation , reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nearest - neighbor hopping integral chosen to be negative , as is the case for j - aggregates , and @xmath17 denotes the pauli creation ( annihilation ) operator of the first excited state of molecule @xmath1 ( the state with all the molecules in their ground states serves as the vacuum state @xmath18 and has zero energy ) . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ h_ex ] ) represents the hamiltonian of non - interacting molecules , in which @xmath19 is the energy of the first excited state of molecule @xmath1 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being , respectively , the mean value of the energy and a static random offset .",
    "the latter simulates on - site ( diagonal ) disorder and results in localization of the excitonic states .",
    "fluctuations of the nearest - neighbor coupling are neglected .",
    "it will be assumed that @xmath21 is distributed uniformly within the interval @xmath22 $ ] , so that the typical magnitude of the disorder is given by the standard deviation @xmath23 . for @xmath24",
    "the exciton eigenfunctions are localized within rather large segments of the chain : @xmath25 .   throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume that this condition holds .",
    "the high - lying electronic - vibrational molecular term , depicted as `` 2 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , serves as the intermediate state through which annihilation occurs .",
    "@xcite we consider one of the electronic - vibrational levels to be resonant with the two - exciton optical states and to undergo an efficient phonon - assisted relaxation to the ground vibronic state ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the annihilation process itself consists of transferring the energy of two excitons to the high - lying molecular term . assuming this step to occur due to the resonant dipole - dipole inter - molecular interaction ,",
    "we may write the corresponding hamiltonian as follows @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the matrix element of the annihilation operator for nearest neighbors and @xmath28 denotes the pauli creation ( annihilation ) operator of the high - lying state of molecule @xmath1 . the operator  ( [ hex - ex ] ) annihilates the two excitations occupying molecules @xmath29 and @xmath1 and excites one of these molecules in the high - lying state .",
    "the implication of @xmath30 for third - order nonlinear optics of j - aggregates has been studied in ref .  .",
    "in accordance with our arguments in sec .",
    "[ motiv ] , we will assume that not more than two excitons are created by the pump per linear chain .",
    "moreover , we will assume that @xmath31 is small compared to the rate , @xmath32 , of phonon - assisted relaxation in the high - lying molecular state .",
    "we may then use perturbation theory to calculate the rate of annihilation .",
    "moreover , the back process ( exciton fission ) can then be neglected . the resulting expression for the rate of exciton - exciton annihilation starting from the two exciton eigenstate @xmath33  ( @xmath34 )",
    "is simply given by the `` golden rule '' @xmath35 is the density of final states ( hereafter replaced by @xmath36 ) .",
    "because of the fermionic nature of one - dimensional frenkel excitons , one can compose the two - exciton eigenfunctions as slater determinants of the one - exciton eigenfunctions :    [ one ] @xmath37 @xmath38    where @xmath39 are the eigenfunctions of the one - exciton problem @xmath40 here , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the eigenenergy of the one - exciton state @xmath43 . substituting eq .",

    "( [ wex - ex_gen ] ) we used the fact that frenkel excitons are non - interacting fermions whenever the nearest - neighbor approximation is used for the hopping integrals .",
    "they become interacting quasi - particles when including the coupling to far neighbors .",
    "the importance of the latter can be estimated through the changes which the long - range terms produce in the density of exciton states .",
    "it is known that in one - dimensional aggregates , the long - range dipole - dipole interactions shift the exciton band bottom by approximately 20% compared to the nearest - neighbor model .",
    "@xcite the smallness of this shift suggests the corrections due to long - range interactions to be of a perturbative nature .",
    "indeed , for few - particle states , frenkel excitons are weakly interacting ( well - defined ) fermions , despite the long - range coupling .    furthermore ,",
    "as follows from the results of both numerical simulations  @xcite and theoretical estimates  @xcite of the linear optical properties of disordered frenkel chains , the oscillator strengths of the optical transitions near the lower band edge grow by approximately a factor of 2.5 due to the long - range dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "this results from a larger extension of the optically active exciton states in the exact dipole - dipole model compared to the nearest - neighbor model ( at a fixed disorder strength ) . in principle , this effect is not of a perturbative nature .",
    "it can , however , be included into the final formulas for the annihilation rates ( see below ) by rescaling the number of coherently bound molecules @xmath11 .",
    "the above arguments justify the nearest - neighbor framework as a reasonable approach to describe frenkel excitons .",
    "it is worth stressing , though , that the dipole - dipole interaction in the annihilation channel ( @xmath48 ) can generally not be taken in the nearest - neighbor approximation , because the annihilation of two excitons localized on separate localization segments is determined by the coupling to far neighbors .",
    "as in the present paper we are mainly interested in the annihilation kinetics itself , we will neglect any other possible channel of population relaxation , such as the radiative transitions from two - exciton to one - exciton states ( also acting towards lowering the exciton population ) , as well as a possible multi - phonon relaxation from the high - lying term to the one - exciton states ( acting , on the contrary , towards raising again the exciton population ) . to calculate the kinetics of the exciton - exciton annihilation",
    ", we will assume that excitons are created by a resonant laser pulse , that is short compared to the inverse of the j - band width .",
    "under these conditions , the initial populations of the two - exciton state @xmath49 is proportional to the corresponding oscillator strength @xmath50 given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the chain s dipole operator ( the chain length is assumed to be smaller than the emission wavelength ) .",
    "after the initial creation process , excitons may in principle move over the chain , at low temperature , however , the possibility to move is very restricted and the optically excited localized frenkel excitons are practically immobile .",
    "@xcite the reason is that at low temperature ( @xmath53 width of j - band ) , an exciton created in one of the local ground states may move to an other similar state only when the latter has an energy lower than the former .",
    "the typical energy offset between the local ground states is of the order of the width of their energy distribution ( i.e. , the width of the j - band ) .",
    "therefore , after one jump the exciton typically resides in the tail of this distribution .",
    "the number of states with still lower energy then drastically reduces , giving rise to a strong increase of the mean distance to such lower energy states .",
    "in fact , already after one jump the exciton has a strongly suppressed chance to jump further , i.e. , such a type of the spatio - energetic diffusion ( towards lowering the energy ) is stopped rapidly and does not yield a sufficient possibility for two excitons to approach each other and annihilate .",
    "it is worth noting that experiments also indicate the absence of such a diffusion , which would manifest itself in a red shift of the exciton emission spectrum relative to the absorption spectrum .",
    "the experimental data show that such a stokes shift is either absent or has a small magnitude .",
    "@xcite a similar situation occurs in glasses doped with rare - earth ions .",
    "@xcite    following the above arguments , we will assume that two excitons annihilate from the positions where they have been created .",
    "then , the time dependence of the population of the excited two - exciton states is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and angular brackets denote an average over the disorder realizations .",
    "note that we have normalized the population such that it equals 2 at @xmath56",
    ". the formula  ( [ p_a ] ) will be the basis of our further analysis of the low - temperature annihilation kinetics .",
    "before carrying out numerical simulations , we first provide a qualitative analysis of eq .",
    "( [ p_a ] ) . following the arguments concerning the nature of the low - energy weakly localized one - dimensional states , we separate the summation in eq .",
    "( [ p_a ] ) into two parts : @xmath57 .",

    "the second part , @xmath61 , contains those terms where @xmath60 and @xmath43 reside on different segments .",
    "the fact that this distinction can only be made for low - energy states is no restriction , as anyhow these states are the ones that dominate the ground state to one - exciton and the one - to - two - exciton absorption spectrum . using the picture of exciton states on a chain of effective length @xmath11 ,",
    "one arrives at the intra - segment annihilation rate :  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath9 is given by eq .",
    "( [ w_0 ] ) and the factor @xmath63 .",
    "the second term , @xmath61 , governs the annihilation of two excitons created on different localization segments and is characterized by the rate  @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the distance between the two excited segments .",
    "note that the rate of the inter - segment annihilation scales linearly with @xmath66 . as the wave functions of both segments enter the expression for @xmath67",
    ", one might intuitively expect a quadratic dependence on @xmath66 .",
    "however , only one of the two excited segments , namely the one that passes to the ground state @xmath18 in the annihilation process , coherently contributes to @xmath67 giving the factor @xmath66 ( so - called superradiant transition ) .",
    "the transition within the other excited segment occurs to the high - lying molecular state of each molecule .",
    "it is important to note that the latter events are summed incoherently , as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ wex - ex_gen ] ) , thus preventing the appearance of an extra power of @xmath66 .    keeping in mind that @xmath68 as well as that the numerical factor in eq .",

    "( [ w_intra ] ) and  ( [ w_inter ] ) that @xmath69 provided that @xmath11 is of the order of or larger than several units , which is the condition we will focus on in the simulations . from this",
    ", one expects that the kinetics of the exciton - exciton annihilation will consist of two distinct parts : a very fast short - time decay , described by @xmath58 , and a very slow long - time tail for which @xmath61 is responsible . in order to estimate the relative weight of these two components",
    ", we will take into account the fact that the oscillator strengths of double excitation of a particular localization segment and excitation of two different segments are of the same order . then",
    ", statistical arguments based on the poisson distribution seem to be sufficient for making estimates .",
    "if the initial density of excitations equals @xmath6 ( in our case , @xmath70 ) , the probability of finding a typical localization segment ( of length @xmath11 ) to be @xmath71-fold excited reads @xmath72 therefore , the probabilities of double excitation of a typical localization segment and of excitation of two different segments are given by  @xmath73 and  @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "thus , the relative contribution of the shorter component in @xmath75 is of the order of  @xmath76 , which drops upon increasing the disorder strength @xmath77 ( or upon a corresponding decrease of @xmath11 ) and grows with increasing the density of excitations @xmath6 .",
    "now , we turn to a discussion of the character of the annihilation kinetics .",
    "we recall that in the bi - molecular model , the decay is non - exponential , as a result of the nonlinearity of the driving equation  ( [ bme ] ) .",
    "we will argue that in our case , the kinetics is also non - exponential , which , however , does not result from a nonlinearity .",
    "let us consider first the intra - segment channel of annihilation . here",
    ", according to eq .",
    "( [ p_a ] ) , the nonexponentiality is expected even in the absence of disorder ( i.e. , for a regular chain ) , because the annihilation rate @xmath78 obviously depends on which exciton states are involved in the annihilation process ( see the next section ) . in the presence of disorder",
    ", there is an additional source for the non - exponential behavior of annihilation through the intra - segment channel .",

    "due to this fact , the resulting nonexponentiality is expected to be considerable .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in sec .  [ simul ] confirm this picture .",
    "the origin of the non - exponential behavior of the inter - segment annihilation is two - fold .",

    "( [ w_inter ] ) ) .",
    "thus , fluctuations of the latter will affect the annihilation kinetics even for a fixed distance between excited segments .",

    "our analysis leads to three main conclusions :    i - the entire kinetics consists of two well - distinguished components : a very slow long - time decay and a much faster short - time drop . the latter component becomes faster with higher degree of disorder .",
    "the weight of the faster component is much smaller than that of the slower one , and decreases with increasing disorder strength .",
    "these findings are well - understood from the existence of two competing options for two excitons to annihilate .",
    "the slower component is driven by the annihilation of exciton states localized on different segments of the chain , while the faster one originates from the annihilation of doubly excited segments .",
    "fluctuations of distances between two excitons and sizes of the localization segments explain the non - exponential nature of the slower and faster components , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to estimate the typical rates of both annihilation channels for existing j - aggregates . in order to do this , we need information concerning the parameters @xmath119 , @xmath27 , and @xmath32 . for",
    "j - aggregates @xmath120 @xmath121 is quite typical .",
    "@xcite less information consists concerning the annihilation interaction @xmath27 , but as we assumed it to be of dipolar origin it seems not unreasonable to take a value similar to @xmath119 .",
    "this is , in fact , supported by semi - empirical calculations of higher molecular singlet states of pseudo - isocyanine ( pic ) molecules .",
    "@xcite these calculations indicate a molecular @xmath122 transition that is similar in energy and oscillator strength as the @xmath123 transition responsible for pic s well - known j - band .",
    "we thus take @xmath124 @xmath121 .",
    "finally , we will take @xmath125 @xmath121 , corresponding to a vibrational relaxation time in the @xmath126 state of about 10 fs . using these numbers , we arrive at @xmath127 s@xmath128 .",
    "the corresponding estimate for the inter - segment annihilation rate taken for adjacent segments ( @xmath129 ) reads @xmath130 s@xmath128 .    at low temperatures , the quantity @xmath11 is found to be of the order of several tens  @xcite . letting @xmath131 , as was reported in refs .   and  ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath132 s@xmath128 and @xmath133 s@xmath128 .",
    "note that the magnitude of @xmath67 appears to be even smaller than the spontaneous emission rate of a single molecule , which typically is of a few times @xmath134 s@xmath128 .",
    "certainly @xmath67 is much smaller than the spontaneous emission rate for an exciton state .",
    "it is to be noted furthermore that raising @xmath11 by a factor of 2 will reduce @xmath67 by almost two orders of magnitude . from the above",
    ", an important conclusion can be deduced : the inter - segment channel of exciton - exciton annihilation is in fact ineffective at low temperatures , because the radiative relaxation is much faster . on the contrary ,",
    "the intra - segment annihilation rate is fairly high and should be viewed as the unique way for two weakly localized excitons to annihilate at low temperature .",
    "however , since this process occurs only for doubly excited localization segments , it will affect the entire exciton population only if the number of doubly excited segments is high , i.e. , at sufficiently high laser intensities .",
    "we note that the separation into inter - segment and intra - segment annihilation channels was in fact concluded from transient absorption experiments on pic j - aggregates at 20  k.  @xcite the part of the observed annihilation kinetics with a decay time of 200 fs may indeed be related to intra - segment annihilation , as is clear from our estimate for @xmath135 .",
    "our estimate for @xmath67 shows , however , that it is unlikely that the second component of the kinetics reported in refs .   and  , with a decay time of 1.5 ps , may indeed be ascribed to inter - segment annihilation ( see also the discussion in refs .   and  ) .",
    "our findings concerning the ineffectiveness of inter - segment annihilation provide us with a way to control the exciton - exciton annihilation at low temperature . indeed , recall that the local ground and first excited states belonging to the same localization segment are separated by the energy offset @xmath136 , which is of the order of the j - band width .",
    "@xcite for typical j - aggregates , the exciton radiative rate @xmath2 , representing the unique relaxation constant at low temperatures , is much smaller than this energy mismatch .",
    "hence one may get a large number of localization segments to be singly excited by applying a field with rabi frequency smaller than @xmath137 , but larger than @xmath2 . at the same time",
    ", none of the localization segments will be doubly excited .",
    "therefore , under such conditions , a fairly large exciton population may be created in j - aggregates , without being affected by exciton - exciton annihilation .",
