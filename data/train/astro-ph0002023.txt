    "accretion of material onto a black hole is known to produce hard x  ray ( @xmath0 kev ) emission : satellite observations over the last 30 years have conclusively shown this to be the case for both stellar mass black holes in our own galaxy , and the supermassive black holes which power the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "however , it is still the case that the mechanism by which the gravitational potential energy is converted into high energy radiation is not understood .",
    "standard models of an accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , hereafter ss ) produce copious uv and even soft x  ray radiation , but are completely unable to explain the observed higher energy x  ray emission which extends from the disk spectrum out to 200 kev . clearly something other than the standard model is required , and the two currently favored candidates are either magnetic reconnection above an accretion disk ( e.g. galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; di matteo 1998 ) , or that some part of the accretion flow is not given by the standard disk configuration .",
    "the recent rediscovery of another stable solution of the accretion flow equations lent plausibility to this second possibility .",
    "the standard ss accretion disk model derives the accretion flow structure in the limit where the gravitational energy released is radiated locally in an optically thick , geometrically thin disk .",
    "this contrasts with the new accretion models , where below some critical mass accretion rate , @xmath1 , the material is not dense enough to thermalise and locally radiate all the gravitational potential energy which is released .",
    "instead the energy can be carried along with the flow ( advected ) , eventually disappearing into the black hole .",
    "these solutions give an x  ray hot , optically thin , quasi ",
    "spherical flow ( narayan & yi 1995 ; esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 )",
    ".    clearly it would be nice to know which ( if any ! ) of these models for the hard x  ray emission is correct . in its most general form",
    "the problem comes down to understanding the geometry of the cool , optically thick accretion flow .",
    "if this extends down to the last stable orbit around the black hole then it is unlikely that the advective flow can exist ( e.g.  janiuk , ycki & czerny 1999 ) .",
    "conversely , if the optically thick disk truncates before this point then a composite model with an outer disk and inner , hot , advective flow ( adaf ) may be favored .    the accretion flow can be tracked via x  ray spectroscopy . wherever hard x ",
    "rays illuminate optically thick material then this gives rise to a compton reflected continuum and associated iron k@xmath2 fluorescence line ( e.g.lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the line and reflected continuum is dependent on the solid angle subtended by the disk to the x  ray source ( as well as on elemental abundances , inclination and ionisation ) .",
    "the two models outlined above can then be distinguished by the amount of reflection and line , since an untruncated disk should subtend a rather larger solid angle than a truncated one .",
    "a survey of agn showed that seyfert 1 spectra are consistent with a power law x  ray spectrum illuminating an optically thick , ( nearly ) neutral disk , which subtends a solid angle of @xmath3 ( pounds et al .",
    "1990 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "this then seems to favor the magnetic reconnection picture .",
    "however , this contrasts with the situation in the galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) .",
    "these are also thought to be powered by accretion via a disk onto a black hole , and , in their low / hard state , show broad band spectra which are rather similar to those from agn , but have an apparently rather smaller amount of reflection ( e.g. gierliski et al . 1997 ; done & ycki 1999 ) .",
    "one potential drawback of this comparison is that agn inhabit a more complex environment than the gbhc .",
    "unification schemes for seyfert galaxies propose that there is a molecular torus which enshrouds the nucleus .",
    "the molecular torus can also contribute to the reflected spectrum , perhaps distorting our view of the very innermost regions in agn .",
    "these two potential sites for the reflected component can be distinguished spectrally : any features from the accretion disk should be strongly smeared by the combination of special and general relativistic effects expected from the high orbital velocities in the vicinity of a black hole ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) , whereas the molecular torus is at much larger distances so its reflected features should be _",
    "narrow_. the seminal asca observation of the agn mcg63015 showed that the line is so broad that it requires that the accretion disk extends down to _ at least _",
    "the last stable orbit in a schwarzschild metric , with _ no _ narrow component from the molecular torus ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ) , and that the relativistically smeared material subtended a solid angle of @xmath3 with respect to the x  ray source .",
    "this very clear cut result then seems to rule out the advective flows , at least in their simplest form .",
    "however , the gbhc again show a rather different picture : they have a line which is detectably broad , but not so broad as might be expected for a disk extending all the way down to 3 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath4 ; ycki , done , & smith 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ; done & ycki 1999 ) .",
    "this _ is _ consistent with the truncated disk geometry , and so perhaps with the advective flow models . only in the soft / high state",
    "do the gbhc seem to show the extreme relativistic smearing and large amount of reflection seen in the mcg63015 spectra ( ycki et al .",
    "1998 , gierliski et al . 1999 ) .",
    "is there a real difference in accretion geometry between gbhc and agn , pointing to a difference in radiation mechanism ?",
    "this seems unlikely , since both classes are ultimately accreting black holes .",
    "are subtle ionisation effects masking the derived disk parameters in the gbhc ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ) . or is mcg63015 unusual among agn ( and gbhc ) in having such a relativistic disk ? perhaps mcg63015 is an agn in a state which corresponds to the soft state gbhc ?",
    "one factor supporting the latter is a recent study by zdziarski , lubiski , & smith ( 1999 ) which showed that there is a correlation between the intrinsic spectral slope , @xmath5 , and the solid angle subtended by the reflecting material , @xmath6 . in their plots",
    ", mcg63015 is the agn with the steepest spectrum , and highest amount of reflection .",
    "this correlation also holds for individual objects ( such as ngc 5548 for agn and nova muscae for the gbhc ) , where the intrinsic spectrum hardens as the amount of reflection decreases .",
    "this suggests that there is a universal physical mechanism and/or geometry for both classes , with perhaps a single parameter determining the state of a given source through a feedback between the geometry and physical conditions in the x  ray emitting region .",
    "such a feedback could be provided by e.g.  soft photons from the thermalized fraction of the hard x ",
    "rays intercepted by the reprocessing medium , and the parameter could be the inner disk radius .",
    "perhaps for mcg63015 ( and other soft agn and the soft state gbhc ) the cool accretion disk extends down to the innermost stable orbit around the black hole with the x ",
    "rays being powered by magnetic reconnection above the disk , while for harder spectra agn ( and the low state gbhc ) the inner disk recedes outwards , being replaced by an x  ray hot ( advective ? ) flow .",
    "as the disk recedes it subtends a smaller solid angle , so there is less reflection ( and less relativistic smearing ) , but there are also fewer seed photons from the disk ( both from intrinsic emission and by reprocessing ) for compton scattering into the intrinsic power law , giving a harder intrinsic power law ( ycki et al .",
    "1999 ; zdziarski et al . 1999 ) .",
    "if this is true , then this clearly predicts that the fe k@xmath2 line _ in agn _ is not always as broad as in the extreme case of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( tanaka et al .",
    "previous asca studies on a sample of objects ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) hint towards such a possibility , since a whole range of geometries were inferred for various objects .",
    "here we test this idea using asca , xte and osse data from ic 4329a , the brightest typical seyfert 1 in the x  ray band ( cf .",
    "madejski et al .",
    "it lies towards the middle of the @xmath7 plot of zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and ( consequently ) has a spectrum very close to that of the mean seyfert 1 spectrum compiled by zdziarski et al .",
    "ic 4329a may then be used as a template for seyfert galaxies as a class , unlike mcg63015 which has a rather steep x  ray spectral index .",
    "the 1997 campaign for ic 4329a included four asca pointings , on august 7 , 10 , 12 , and 16 , each nominally providing 20 ks of data .",
    "the resulting data were extracted using the standard screening procedures , yielding total exposures of 61 ks for sis0 and sis1 ( using the bright2 mode ) , and 78 ks for gis2 and gis3 .",
    "the source data were extracted from circular regions with radii of 3 arc min for the siss and 4 arc min for the giss , while background was taken from a source - free regions of the same images .",
    "the source showed a clear variability between the four pointings , with gis2 counting rates of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , matching the variability seen in the simultaneous rxte data ( see below and fig .",
    "the pha data were then grouped so as to have more than 20 counts per bin .",
    "ic4329a was observed a total of 66 times over a period of 58 days with rxte .",
    "the pca standard 2 data were extracted from all layers of detectors 0,1 and 2 , using standard selection criteria ( earth elevation angle @xmath12 , offset between the source and the satellite pointing direction @xmath13 , electron rates in each detector @xmath14 , excluding data taken within 30 minutes of the saa passage ) .",
    "this gave a total of 73 ks of good data .",
    "the background for these data were then modeled using the l7 model ( see zhang et al . 1993 ; madejski et al .",
    "1999 ; and jahoda et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) , and the corresponding response matrix for each observation was generated using version 3.0 of the channel to energy conversion file .",
    "we use data from 320 kev , since lower energies are affected by response matrix uncertainties and the background may not be well modeled above 20 kev .",
    "a 1% systematic error is applied to data in all pha channels .",
    "the hexte instrument onboard rxte ( cf .",
    "rothschild et al .",
    "1998 ) consists of two scintillator modules , sensitive in the hard x  ray band .",
    "the background is measured via chopping the detectors to off - axis , source free locations every 16 seconds .",
    "the hexte data were extracted using standard data reduction procedures , which , after appropriate dead - time correction , yielded a total net exposure of @xmath15 ks .",
    "the source was clearly detected in each pointing over the range of 15  100 kev range , at a level consistent with the pca , but the statistical errors in each pointing were too large to study variability .",
    "the resultant data were binned such that channels 1728 ( 16.9 - 28.3 kev ) were grouped by a factor 3 , 2948 ( 28.347.8 kev ) by a factor 4 and 49120 ( 47.8123.4 kev ) by a factor 6 .",
    "the effective area of both hexte clusters was scaled by 0.7 , the current best normalization to the crab spectrum .",
    "osse pointed at ic  4329a during the cgro viewing period 625 , over the epoch of 1997 august 8 to 18 , with the total exposure of 567 ks .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner ( see johnson et al . 1997 and references therein ) , resulting in a net counting rate of @xmath16 counts s@xmath17 over the 50  500 kev range .",
    "the resulting data were binned such that channels 918 were grouped by a factor 5 , while 1948 were grouped by a factor 10 .",
    "figure 1 shows the 210 kev light curve obtained from the rxte pca data .",
    "the source is clearly variable on timescales of a few days , with an _ r.m.s _ variation of 13% .",
    "there is no significant short timescale variability within each observations .",
    "these typically have 3@xmath18 upper limits of 0.06 to the fractional _",
    "r.m.s _ variability of the 10002000 second lightcurve binned on 16 seconds .",
    "the horizontal lines on figure 1 mark the times at which asca and osse data were taken .",
    "the data were fitted using xspec v10.0 , with errors quoted as 90% confidence intervals ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we use elemental abundances and cross - sections of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "data from sis0 and sis1 are showing increasing divergence with time from the gis2 and gis3 ( and from each other ) at low energies .",
    "the reasons for this are not yet well understood ( weaver & gelbord 1999 , in preparation ) . a current pragmatic approach is to allow excess absorption in the sis detectors to account for this effect to zeroth order .",
    "another source of low energy complexity is the partially ionized absorber , first seen in the rosat pspc spectrum ( madejski et al .",
    "a previous asca observation has shown that in ic4329a this complex absorption is better modeled by two edges ( corresponding to h and he  like oxygen at rest energies of 0.739 and 0.871 kev , respectively ) rather than a full ionized absorber code ( cappi et al .",
    "1996 ; reynolds 1997 see also the discussion in george et al .",
    "we use this description here , but we caution that the determination of this absorption in our data will be somewhat dependent on the way the low energy calibration problems are treated .    we first use a phenomenological model for the asca data , consisting of an underlying power law and its reflected continuum from a neutral disk ( pexrav : magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) inclined at @xmath20 , together with a separate gaussian iron line , with the two edge description for the warm absorber .",
    "this model gives a good fit to the data ( @xmath21 ) , for an intrinsic power law spectrum of @xmath22 , and reflector solid angle ( for an inclination of @xmath20 ) of @xmath23 .",
    "the associated iron k@xmath2 fluorescence line is at a ( rest frame ) energy of @xmath24 kev , with equivalent width of @xmath25 ev and intrinsic width of @xmath26 kev ( hereafter all intrinsic line widths are the gaussian @xmath18 ) .",
    "the iron line physical width is similar to that seen in a previous observation of this agn ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1995 ; cappi et al .",
    "1996 ; reynolds 1997 ) , but is much smaller than that seen from the archetypal relativistically smeared line in mcg63015 ( tanaka et al .",
    "one way to show this is to fit the spectrum in the 2.510 kev band ( where the effects of the ionised absorption is much less ) with a simple power law and its expected reflected continuum ( with solar abundances , and fixed solid angle @xmath27 at @xmath20 inclination ) .",
    "the fit excludes the 57 kev iron line range .",
    "figure 2a shows the resulting shape of the line residuals from ic4329a , while figure 2b shows those from mcg63015 for comparison .",
    "replacing the gaussian line with a diskline relativistic model ( fixing the disk inclination at @xmath20 and line emissivity at @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) gives that the smearing implies an inner disk radius of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 : a slightly worse fit than the simple broad gaussian line ) .",
    "this is significantly larger than the last stable orbit at @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , so the last stable orbit at 3 schwarzchild radii is at @xmath34 ) .",
    "the derived radius is dependent on the form of the emissivity , but fits to two separate observations of mcg63015 require @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ( nandra et al 1997 ) , showing that the line emission is strongly weighted towards the innermost radii . we might also expect this on theoretical arguments .",
    "the energy emitted per unit area of a disk goes as @xmath37 , so this should give the time averaged emissivity from a magnetic corona , as well as being a good approximation to the illumination expected from a central spherical source ( see appendix a in ycki  et al 1999 ) .",
    "thus we fix @xmath29 in all our fits , which gives @xmath38 for an inner radius equal to the last stable orbit at _ any _ inclination .",
    "the reflection description used above has several drawbacks .",
    "firstly it allows the line to vary in intensity ( and energy ) without reference to the reflected continuum .",
    "secondly , the relativistic smearing is only applied to the iron line , and not to the reflected continuum also .",
    "we replace these components with the reflection model described by ycki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , rel - repr , which calculates the self  consistent line associated with the reflected continuum , and then applies the relativistic smearing ( including gravitational light bending ) to this total reprocessed spectrum .",
    "the ionisation state is a free parameter , and the models are calculated for iron abundance between @xmath39 solar .",
    "the reprocessor in agn is generally assumed to be neutral but an accretion disk temperature of @xmath40 ev can give a thermal population dominated by ions with ionization potential @xmath41 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) i.e. between fe v  fex , which in our model corresponds to @xmath42 . photo ",
    "ionisation by the x  ray source can increase these estimates considerably .",
    "we replace the pexrav and diskline components with our combined model for the reprocessed component .",
    "we allow the ionisation , iron abundance , and inner disk radius to be fit parameters , for a fixed inclination of @xmath20 , and for a fixed line emissivity of @xmath43 .",
    "this again gave a disk inner radius of @xmath44 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we extracted rxte data which were taken exactly simultaneously with the asca observation ( datasets 4,5,6,11,12,13,16,1601,18,19 and 20 ) , giving a total pca exposure of 13 ks .",
    "the corresponding hexte data over this short time interval have very low signal to noise so do not add any appreciable constraints .",
    "figure 3a shows the residuals resulting from an absorbed power law fit to the pca data , showing the classic signature of compton reflection and its associated iron fluorescence line ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "figure 3b shows residuals including a broad gaussian line in the fit .",
    "clearly there are still systematic residuals , with a decrement at the expected energy of the iron edge and a rise to higher energies ( @xmath46 ) . including a reflected continuum component ( the pexrav model in xspec , assuming solar abundances and inclination of @xmath20 )",
    "gives @xmath47 , showing that the reflected _ continuum _ component is significantly detected independently of the iron line .",
    "since the data are simultaneous , we can fix the absorption ( warm and cold ) to that seen in the gis for the same model fit to the asca data .",
    "this gives an excellent fit to the data with @xmath48 ( rather too good in fact , showing that the statistics are dominated by the 1 per cent systematic error ) for an intrinsic power law spectrum of @xmath49 , and reflector solid angle ( for an inclination of @xmath20 ) of @xmath50 .",
    "the associated iron k@xmath2 fluorescence line is at a ( rest frame ) energy of @xmath51 kev , with equivalent width of @xmath52 ev and intrinsic width ( gaussian @xmath18 ) of @xmath53 kev .",
    "the pca 210 kev flux is 25 per cent higher than that from asca due to absolute flux calibration problems in both instruments : asca gives a crab 210 kev flux of @xmath54 ergs s@xmath17 ( makishima et al .",
    ", 1996 ) , while rxte gives @xmath55 ergs s@xmath17 ( see pca crab spectrum at http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/keith/pcarmf.html ) and the original crab calibration is @xmath56 ergs s@xmath17 ( toor & seward 1974 ) .",
    "a more serious discrepancy is in the spectral index , which is @xmath57 steeper than that seen in asca .",
    "it is known that the current rxte pca calibration gives results for the crab which are roughly @xmath57 steeper than the index assumed for the calibration of other instruments ( k. jahoda , private communication )",
    ". however , reassuringly , the relative amount of reflection equivalent width , energy and intrinsic width of the line are consistent with those from the asca data , though of course the absolute normalisations are different due to the calibration discrepancies . tieing the absorption across the two datasets , together with the relative reflection parameters ( the reflector solid angle , its inner radius and ionisation state , and the iron line energy , width and equivalent width )",
    "gives @xmath58 , not significantly different from the @xmath59 obtained from the separate fits .",
    "thus in what follows we tie the relative reflection ( and absorber ) parameters across the two datasets , and let only the power law spectral index and normalization be free .",
    "we replace the pexrav and broad gaussian line with our rel - repr model .",
    "table 1 shows the results of a joint fit to the asca and rxte pca data for inclination angles of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 and for iron abundances of @xmath63 and @xmath64 solar .",
    "the derived inner disk radius is highly correlated with the assumed inclination .",
    "high inclination angles give stronger doppler effects and so a broader line .",
    "the inner disk radius then has to be larger to match the observed line width .",
    "however , _ none _ of the fits allow the disk to extend down to the innermost stable orbit , irrespective of inclination .",
    "this also means that the data are not very sensitive to the inclination ( @xmath65 , i.e. marginally significant preference for higher inclinations ) .",
    "it is only the broadest components from the very innermost disk which significantly change the skewness of the line profile ( as opposed to its width ) as function of inclination .",
    "the data _ are _ sensitive to the iron abundance .",
    "they significantly prefer supersolar abundances ( @xmath66 ) , as would be expected from measurements of radial abundance gradients in spiral galaxies ( e.g. henry & worthey 1999 ) .",
    "another way to see this is the phenomenological fits give a line equivalent with of @xmath67 ev , as expected for a solar abundance slab subtending a solid angle of @xmath68 ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ) , yet the solid angle of the reflected continuum in these fits is approximately half of this .",

    "the presence of the narrow component means that the relativistic effects have to be more marked than in the single reflector fits in order to make the total line as broad as before .",
    "thus the derived inner disk radius is always rather smaller than before _ but still never consistent with the 3 schwarzschild radii_. the smaller inner radius means that the lower inclination reflected spectra are significantly gravitationally redshifted , so requiring the reflector to be somewhat ionized to compensate for this .",

    "we test this by dividing the disk into 10 radial zones , with ionisation @xmath135 as described in done & ycki ( 1999 ) . with the inner radius fixed at @xmath34 , and allowing for a narrow component from the molecular torus we are never able to obtain fits within @xmath136 of those in table 2 .",
    "there is clear intensity variability during the rxte campaign , and also spectral variability in the sense that the spectrum becomes softer as the source brightens .",
    "this could be due to either intrinsic change in the power law spectral index , or a change in the relative contribution of the reflected spectrum ( or both ) .",
    "we can attempt to disentangle the power law from the reflected spectrum by fitting these components to the individual spectra from each orbit ( including a 1 per cent systematic uncertainty ) , fixing the absorption at @xmath137 @xmath107 .",
    "the reflected spectrum is assumed to have twice solar iron abundance , be inclined at @xmath104 and have fixed negligible ionisation ( @xmath138 , see table 1 ) .",
    "thus the free parameters are the power law index and normalization , the solid angle subtended by the relativistic reflector and its inner radius .",
    "figure 5a shows these derived parameters as a function of time .",
    "clearly the inner radius can not be constrained , but the index and the solid angle of the reflector show some possible trend . fitting these with a constant gives @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively i.e. they are statistically consistent with a constant value .",
    "figure 5b shows these plotted against the 210 kev flux , and a linear regression ( taking errors in both @xmath141 and @xmath142 into account : press et al .",
    "1992 ) shows that the power law index is _ significantly _ correlated with flux , since it gives @xmath143 .",
    "this corresponds to an f value of @xmath144 , significant at @xmath145 per cent . even using just the difference in @xmath146 between the two fits gives @xmath147 , significant at @xmath148 per cent , so the correlation is clearly present .",
    "ic4329a then becomes only the second seyfert 1 where there is clear _ intrinsic _ spectral variability ( the other is ngc 5548 : magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ) , where underlying continuum changes can be unambiguously disentangled from changes in the reflected spectrum .",
    "we use the same procedure to look for variability in the amount of reflection as a function of flux .",
    "the linear regression gives @xmath149 where the fractional amount of reflection relative to the power law _ decreases _ as the flux increases . this is significant at @xmath150 per cent confidence on an f test , but is only 90 per cent significant using just the change in @xmath146 .    to illustrate these points",
    "we co  add spectra when the source was at its lowest and highest intensity level ( see figure 1 ) , and fit these spectra with a power law and single relativistically smeared reflector ( with reflector parameters fixed as above , and with the disk inner radius fixed at @xmath151 ) . the spectral index changes from @xmath152 to @xmath153 , for the low and high state , respectively .",
    "figure 6 shows the unfolded spectra , with the model extrapolated out to 100 kev .",
    "the thick and thin lines show the model components for the high and low state data , respectively . the underlying continuum is brighter at all energies @xmath154 kev in the high state despite it being steeper , with an integrated 0.01300 kev flux of @xmath155 to @xmath156 ergs @xmath107 s@xmath17 for the low and high state , respectively .",
    "this behaviour is fairly easy to reproduce in comptonisation models in which the seed photons vary ( see discussion ) , but the ( marginally significant ) lack of change in the absolute amount of reflection ( so that the relative reflected fraction in the low state is larger than in the high state ) is harder to explain . clearly a model in which the reflected flux is produced at large distances from the source would be viable , but the reflected spectrum is broadened , so does contain at least some contribution from the relativistically smeared inner disk . for a @xmath157 black hole , then the inner 100 schwarzschild radii are on scales of @xmath158 cm , i.e. less than 1 lightday .",
    "the spectra are taken at intervals of a day or more , so the relativistically smeared reprocessed component should not be appreciably lagged behind the source variability .",
    "one possibility is that this anti  correlation of relative reflected fraction with flux is intrinsic to the source , that the geometry changes in such a way as to produce less reflection as the source brightens and steepens .",
    "however , it is very hard to see how this can be the case .",
    "a brighter , steeper source implies that there are more seed photons for the compton scattering ( see figure 6 and the discussion ) , i.e. that the geometry is such that more disk photons are intercepted by the source .",
    "thus we can easily explain more reflected flux as the source steepens , but not less .",
    "correlation _ of reflected solid angle with spectral index is indeed seen in both galactic black hole candidates ( e.g. ycki et al . 1999 ) and agn ( zdziarski et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it seems much more likely that the ( marginal ) _ anti  correlation _ is an artifact of there being a second reflector at much larger distances from the source .",
    "the light travel time delay then means that the distant reprocessor does not have time to respond to rapid flux variations , so that as the source dims the relative contribution of the reflected spectrum from the distant reprocessor increases .",
    "we include a reprocessed component from a torus , fixing its parameters to the best fit xte values from the joint asca ",
    "rxte fit ( see table 2 , again assuming twice solar abundance and inclination of @xmath104 , but this time also fixing the inner edge of the disk to @xmath159 ) .",
    "the significance of the correlation of the spectral index with flux is unchanged ( @xmath160 for a constant while adding the linear term gives @xmath161 ) , while the flux / accretion disk reflection variability is now consistent with a constant solid angle ( @xmath162 ) : adding a linear term gives an insignificant change ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "the results are similar for a fixed gaussian line rather than a full reprocessed spectrum .",
    "we illustrate this again by fits to the high and low state spectra .",
    "figure 7a shows the confidence contours for the power law spectral index , while figure 7b shows the derived solid angle of the relativistic reflector .",
    "the diagonal lines denote solutions where the power law index and reflected fraction remain constant between the two datasets .",
    "the power law index is clearly variable between the high and low flux level datasets irrespective of how the reprocessor is modelled . with a single reprocessor",
    "then the relative amount of reflection is only consistent with remaining constant at the @xmath164 per cent confidence level .",
    "the data prefer a larger contribution of reflected flux relative to the power law in the low state spectrum i.e. that the absolute normalization of the reflected flux is constant .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines show the same contours for a model including an unsmeared , neutral reprocessed spectrum and gaussian line from the molecular torus , respectively .",
    "the reflected fraction is then consistent with a constant value .",
    "all the rxte pca data were co  added to form a single spectrum ( with 1 per cent systematic uncertainty added ) and fit together with the hexte and osse data to give a broad band spectrum .",
    "current consensus is that the continuum is formed by compton scattering of soft seed photons by hot electrons .",
    "such a comptonised continuum can be approximated by a power law with exponential cutoff , but this becomes inaccurate if the spectrum extends close to the energies of either the seed photons or hot electrons .",
    "the seed photons are presumably from the accretion disk , with expected temperatures of @xmath40 ev , so the spectral curvature here is not an issue .",
    "however , the inclusion of the osse data means that the shape of the spectral cutoff from the electron temperature becomes important .",
    "thus we use an analytical approximation to a comptonised spectrum based on solutions of the kompaneets equation ( lightman & zdziarski 1987 ) , where the shape of the high energy cutoff is sharper than an exponential rollover .",
    "the relativistic reflection and line from this incident continuum are calculated , and included in the model fit .",
    "the results are detailed in table 3 for inclinations of the relativistic reprocessor of @xmath165 and @xmath62 and iron abundances of @xmath63 and @xmath64 solar .",
    "we see the same trend as in table 1 in terms of the spectra preferring higher iron abundance , and these solutions constrain the electron temperature to be @xmath166 kev ( corresponding to an exponential e - folding energy of @xmath167 kev ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the best fit solution for twice solar abundance , inclined at @xmath104 .",
    "however , the poor signal  to  noise of the data at the highest energies means that this temperature is dependent on details of the reflection spectrum . for solar abundances",
    "the temperature is generally unconstrained .",

    "this also means that the derived plasma optical depths in these previous papers of @xmath203 are too low .",
    "modelling the spectrum with more accurate comptonised spectra gives @xmath204 kev and @xmath205 ( zdziarski et al .",
    "firstly , we clearly see that not all agn are consistent with a substantial solid angle of extreme , relativistically smeared reflection . the reprocessed component seen in mgc63015",

    "a similar result is seen in a recent analysis of the asca spectrum of ngc 5548 ( chiang et al .",
    "1999 ) , where the line is broad , but not so broad as expected from a disk which extends down to the last stable orbit around a black hole ( for the june 15th data set they obtain @xmath206 for emissivity @xmath43 ; j.  chiang , private communication ) .",
    "crucially , our data allow us to constrain a reflected component from a molecular torus .",
    "a torus with column @xmath207 @xmath107 can produce a strong , narrow 6.4 kev line , accompanied by a reflected continuum for columns @xmath208 @xmath107 .",
    "we do significantly detect such a contribution to the iron k@xmath2 line , which may also be accompanied by a reflected continuum . however , even with a narrow line from the torus , the remaining line from the accretion is not as broad as that seen in mcg63015 .",
    "the amount of relativistically smeared reflection is rather less than unity for any inclination @xmath209 .",
    "larger inclinations are not expected since this object is classified as a seyfert 1 and no strong absorption from the torus is seen in the x  ray spectrum .",
    "thus the reflection from the accretion disk in ic4329a looks very like that seen in the low state spectra of the galactic black hole systems ( ycki et al .",
    "1998 ; done & ycki 1999 ) in having @xmath210 , relativistically smeared by velocities which are inconsistent with the reflecting material extending down to 3 schwarzschild radii .",
    "there is then no intrinsic difference between the galactic and extragalactic accreting black holes , but there is a spread in source properties in both classes ( intrinsic spectral index , amount of reflection and amount of relativistic smearing ) .",
    "the agn results to date show that steep spectra have a larger amount of reflection ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) and more relativistic smearing .",
    "this is exactly the sequence seen in the galactic black hole candidate nova muscae 1991 ( ycki et al . 1998 ; ycki et al . 1999 ) as a function of decreasing mass accretion rate .",
    "there are currently two ways to explain the lack of extreme relativistic line .",
    "the first is to say that the inner accretion disk is simply not present , that it has been replaced by an x  ray hot flow .",
    "these composite truncated disk / hot x  ray source models were first proposed by shapiro , lightman and eardley ( 1976 ) when they discovered a hot , two temperature , optically thin solution to the accretion flow equations , though this was subsequently shown to be unstable .",
    "such models were given new impetus by the rediscovery of a related _ stable _ solution of the accretion flow equations ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , which include advective as well as radiative cooling ( adafs ) .",
    "these ideas are clearly consistent with our results .",
    "the alternative is that the inner disk is present , as required by the magnetic reconnection models for the x  ray flux , but that it can not be seen in the reflected spectrum .",
    "one way to do this is if the upper layers of the disk are so ionized that they produce almost no atomic spectral features ( ross et al .",
    "simple models for this , where the ionisation state of the disk varies as a smooth function of radius , do not match the data . however , the ionisation structure could be highly complex , with rapid transition between complete ionisation and relatively cool material ( raska 1999 ; s. nayakshin , private communication ) . alternatively , if the x  ray source is moving away from the disk at transrelativistic velocities , perhaps because of plasma ejection from expanding magnetic loops , then its radiation pattern does not strongly illuminate the inner disk ( beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "it is currently very difficult to distinguish observationally between these models , and all have some remaining theoretical problems . for the adaf solutions ,",
    "it is not yet known whether the fundamental assumptions underlying the solutions can hold , or how a transition from the cool disk to a hot flow can occur , while for the disk ",
    "corona geometry the uncertainties are mainly in the detailed outcome of magnetic reconnection , and in the ionisation structure of the illuminated disk .",
    "our data sample the source variability , which gives another way to investigate the underlying radiation mechanisms .",
    "this is only the second agn where the reflected and intrinsic spectrum can be disentangled ( the other is ngc 5548 : magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ; chiang et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the results show that the power law itself clearly gets intrinsically steeper as the source brightens , which allows to constrain the variability process .",
    "if there were merely more dissipation in the x  ray hot corona without an accompanying change in soft seed photon flux then the spectrum would harden as it got brighter ( e.g.ghisellini & haardt 1994 ) .",
    "thus the observed spectral index ",
    "flux correlation implies that the soft seed photons also increase , and by somewhat more than the increase in the hard flux .",
    "seed photons are thought to arise primarily through reprocessing , since the hard x ",
    "rays illuminating the disk which are not reflected are thermalised , emerging as soft photons . in this model",
    "the change in soft photons is commensurate with the change in flux dissipated in the hot corona . to change the seed photons by _ more _ than the change in hard dissipation requires either a change in geometry , such that the hard x  ray source intercepts a larger fraction of the disk radiation , or a decrease in reflection albedo , so that more of the incident hard x  ray radiation is thermalised rather than reflected .",
    "the former can be linked to the composite hot flow / cool accretion disk models as a result of varying the inner disk edge , while the latter could be produced in the disk ",
    "corona models if the ionisation state of the disk decreases for steeper spectra , so that the reflection albedo decreases and the thermalised soft flux increases .",
    "however , recent simultaneous observations of euv and x  ray variability cast doubt on the simple scenario where the euv seed photon flux is primarily reprocessed ( nandra et al .  1998 ; chiang et al .",
    "the variability that we see could equally well be the result of a variable soft photon flux irradiating the x  ray region .",
    "these three possibilities predict some differences in the behavior of the reflected continuum .",
    "if the disk geometry is changing to give more soft seed photons then we expect more solid angle of reflection as the spectrum steepens ( as seen in the agn / xrb compilation of zdziarski et al .",
    "if the increased soft photons are from increasing thermalisation in the disk due to decreasing ionisation , then we should also see more cold reflection ( as opposed to unobservable , completely ionized reflection ) for steeper spectra .",
    "if it is simply the irradiating soft flux which is changing , without changing disk geometry then the reflected fraction should remain constant .",
    "what we see is marginally ( 90 per cent confidence contour ) consistent with a constant reflected fraction , although the data prefer that the relative amount of reflection _ decreases _ as the source increases and steepens .",
    "the resulting spectrum is consistent with the absolute normalisation of the reflected spectrum remaining constant as the source changes .",
    "some part of the reflected spectrum could be contaminated by a line or reprocessed component from a molecular torus , which would be constant due to light travel time delays on the timescales of the monitoring campaign . allowing for this results in the reflected fraction from the accretion disk being",
    "more convincingly consistent with a constant value , but still does not permit much of an increase with increasing flux or spectral index .",
    "the data then support the idea of a variable soft flux which is _ not _ reprocessed as the driver for the hard x  ray variability , but could also allow _ small _ changes in reflection geometry / ionisation .    we speculate that _ both _ variability mechanisms operate in seyferts i.e. that there are spectral changes linked to changes in the geometry / ionisation ( such as seen by zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) , but that the soft seed photons can also vary independently of these changes , giving a second , subtly different source of spectral variability .",
    "@xmath211 not all agn have the extreme relativistic line profiles expected from a disk extending down to the innermost stable orbit around a black hole .",
    "this is consistent with either the inner disk being truncated before the last stable orbit , or with an inner disk which produces no significant reflected features either through anisotropic illumination or extreme ionisation .",
    "simple photo  ionisation models , where the ionisation varies smoothly as a function of radius can be ruled out by the data , but these may differ substantially from more detailed models of the ionisation structure .",
    "@xmath211 there is intrinsic spectral variability , where the power law softens as the source brightens .",
    "this implies that the soft seed photons are increasing faster than the increase of the hard x  ray luminosity .",
    "the lack of a corresponding increase in the observed reflected spectrum implies that either the changes in disk inner radial extent / ionisation structure are small , or that the variability is actually driven by changes in the seed photons which are decoupled from the hard x  ray mechanism .",
