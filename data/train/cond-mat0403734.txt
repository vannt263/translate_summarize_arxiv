    "one major problem in statistical physics is the effect of interactions on the thermodynamical properties of extended fluctuating geometric objects . in general ,",
    "multi - particle attractive or repulsive interactions are involved .",
    "one may divide these into two classes : either ( i ) one may study the interaction of a single fluctuating object with itself as for instance the well known excluded volume interaction between any two monomers in a long polymer chain in a good solvent .",
    "there , the interaction leads to universal long - distance properties of chains as for example the anomalous scaling of the mean squared end - to - end distance . or ( ii ) , the interaction may act between different manifolds or between a single manifold and a fixed non - fluctuating object .",
    "it is then interesting to study how thermal fluctuations affect the depinning of the manifold from an attractive substrate as well as the steric repulsions from a wall .",
    "finally , both cases can appear together .",
    "+ whatever the situation is , it is usually well understood as long as the fluctuating objects are one - dimensional @xcite . referring to the example mentioned above , the long - distance properties of self - avoiding polymers can be analyzed with renormalization group techniques @xcite , either in the continuous edwards hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath8=\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\limits_{x\\in\\mathcal{m}}\\left(\\nabla    \\vec    r(x)\\right)^{2}+\\frac{b_{0}}{2}\\int\\limits_{x\\in\\mathcal{m}}\\int\\limits_{y\\in\\mathcal{m}}\\delta^{d}(\\vec    r(x)-\\vec r(y))\\ , \\ ] ] or by mapping this model on a local @xmath9 symmetric @xmath10-theory in the limit of @xmath11 components @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents describing the long - distance properties are related to the critical exponents of the corresponding @xmath12-vector model at the critical point .",
    "what makes ( [ i.0 ] ) a non - standard theory is that the interaction is non - local , and not a polynomial of the field .",
    "+ obtaining the corresponding results for membranes poses considerable challenges .",
    "the generalization of polymers to @xmath13-surfaces are crystalline fixed - connectivity membranes as they appear for instance in the spectrin network of cell membranes .",
    "considering `` phantom '' membranes which can freely fold into itself , the existence of a bending rigidity induced phase transition separating a high rigidity , low temperature flat phase from a low rigidity , high temperature crumpled phase is well established @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to polymers , which are always crumpled on large scales .",
    "the scaling properties of the crumpled phase of phantom membranes are described by the @xmath13 generalization of the free field part in ( [ i.0 ] ) .",
    "taking self - avoidance into account , which is modeled in ( [ i.0 ] ) through the short - range two - body interaction , we expect more swollen manifolds than those predicted by the free theory , which will be expressed in a non - trivial radius of gyration exponent @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the linear internal size of the membrane , and the radius of gyration @xmath17 is obtained from the effective extend of the membrane in external space . in the case of polymers",
    "@xmath17 scales like the end - to - end distance .",
    "much effort has been spent on calculating corrections to the radius of gyration exponent within an expansion in the deviation @xmath18 from the critical space dimension @xcite .",
    "these calculations can not be performed directly for membrane - dimension @xmath4 , since the naive scaling dimension of the coupling in ( [ i.0 ] ) equals @xmath19=2d-\\frac{2-d}{2}d\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the dimension of the embedding space , such that @xmath21 is always non - zero as @xmath1 , for any embedding dimension @xmath20 .",
    "equivalently , the critical embedding dimension defined through @xmath22 becomes infinity in this limit .",
    "the reason is that the non - self - avoiding membrane densely fills out the embedding space , such that it always `` sees '' the interaction .",
    "a way to circumvent this problem is to set up the expansion about any point @xmath23 and to extrapolate along an appropriate path in the @xmath24-plane to the physically interesting point @xmath25 @xcite . to second order in @xmath18 one then finds a radius of gyration exponent of @xmath26 @xcite , which is a strong correction with respect to the only logarithmic dependence in the non - interacting theory , and indicates the existence of a crumpled phase , for which @xmath27 follows from the fact that a membrane has a finite volume .",
    "+ however , there is no evidence for a crumpled phase in experiments @xcite .",
    "latest monte - carlo simulations on plaquette - models @xcite starting from a discretization of the @xmath13 generalized hamiltonian ( [ i.0 ] ) with system sizes of up to @xmath28 plaquettes shows considerable evidence for a vanishing of the above mentioned crumpling transition in the presence of self - avoidance , such that even on large scales fixed - connectivity membranes stay always flat with a radius of gyration exponent of @xmath29 .",
    "the final purpose of this work is to develop techniques which allow to go beyond the two - loop result .",
    "so far , we developed such techniques for a simplified model , which reduces the non - local self - avoiding interaction in ( [ i.0 ] ) to self - avoidance with only a single point , e.g.  the origin @xmath30 in the membrane : @xmath31=\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\limits_{x\\in\\mathcal{m}}\\left(\\nabla    \\vec    r(x)\\right)^{2}+g_{0}\\int\\limits_{x\\in\\mathcal{m}}\\delta^{d}(\\vec    r(x)-\\vec r(o))\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a special case of a more general model of the interaction of a phantom tethered manifold with a single point in embedding space , which is related to case ( ii ) . the corresponding physical situation to think of is the binding and unbinding of a long chain as e.g.  a polymer or a membrane from a wall or the wetting of an interface .",
    "more precisely , we study the interaction of a single freely fluctuating manifold with another non - fluctuating , fixed object . depending on whether the interaction is attractive or repulsive",
    ", one can distinguish two different scenarios : one may either observe a delocalization transition from an attractive substrate as in wetting phenomena or steric repulsions by a fluctuating manifold .",
    "both cases have in common that excluded volume effects become important .",
    "these scenarios have already been discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ the result of @xcite is the complete resummation of the perturbation series for the effective coupling in the case of @xmath13-membranes .",
    "the long - distance behavior of the resummed theory turned out to be non - trivial in the sense that it emerged from the limiting behavior of a scale invariant theory resulting in an effective coupling growing logarithmically instead of approaching some finite fixed - point value as one would expect it .",
    "this , together with the extremely slow convergence of the perturbation series makes the analysis of the fully resummed theory a _ must _ , because all finite loop calculations fail to extract the correct large distance properties .",
    "the importance of the result becomes evident as soon as one compares it with extrapolations obtained from the @xmath18-expansion at the 2-loop level @xcite .",
    "besides the necessity of calculating diagrams numerically with considerably raising effort as the loop order becomes higher , the @xmath18-expansion has turned out not to be able to make reliable predictions for @xmath32 .",
    "this problem persisted , though we exploited the freedom to set up the expansion about any point @xmath23 , @xmath33 being the critical embedding dimension for given internal dimension @xmath34 and to expand both in @xmath34 and @xmath20 along any appropriate extrapolation path to some physically interesting point @xmath35 .",
    "as soon as @xmath34 approaches @xmath36 the result was always strongly dependent on the selected expansion point . +   + the aim of this paper is two - fold : first , we reconsider the techniques to perform loop calculations within a `` massive scheme '' , that is on a manifold of finite size and with fixed space dimension @xmath37 and @xmath20 .",
    "we show that the perturbation series for the effective coupling can be completely summed in @xmath38 and analyze the long - distance properties in this limit .",
    "in addition to @xcite , instead of analytically continuing loop integrals to @xmath4 from below we also perform calculations directly in @xmath13 , which need an explicit short - distance ( uv)-cutoff .",
    "it turns out that results in @xmath4 are independent of the procedure , i.e.  they are universal .",
    "+ second , we construct a systematic expansion of the effective coupling in powers of @xmath2 .",
    "such an expansion is based on our techniques to resum the perturbation series at each order in @xmath2 . a first attempt to go beyond @xmath4",
    "has already been made in @xcite .",
    "however , there , the effect of the boundaries of the finite manifolds was not taken properly into account , a problem that has now been circumvented by considering closed manifolds .",
    "we specialize to a toroidal internal topology corresponding to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "of course , the propagator of the perturbation series needs to be modified , and diagrams become more difficult to calculate .",
    "slightly below @xmath4 we expect power - law behavior of the effective coupling .",
    "we present a possible ansatz for the exact effective coupling as a function of the internal dimension @xmath39 , which is consistent with the expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "however , it remains an open problem to obtain more information about the power - law behavior , to make this expansion unique .",
    "a short account of this work has already appeared in @xcite .",
    "the problem of a membrane avoiding only a single point ( [ i.1 ] ) may at first sight appear artificial .",
    "besides of being a toy - model for the analysis of the more interesting case of full self - avoidance as discussed above , let us point out that it is , too , a special case of another more general problem , which is interesting by its own . consider a phantom tethered membrane interacting with some @xmath40-potential located at the origin of the configuration space :",

    "the second term models the interaction of the manifold with a single point at the origin in the @xmath20-dimensional configurational space .",
    "let us remind @xcite that the physical interpretation depends on the dimensionality : in the case that @xmath48 is identical to the embedding space , ( [ 2.0 ] ) describes a phantom crumpled manifold interacting with a single defect as sketched in figure [ f2.00 ] .",

    "* @xmath72 : now , the long - distance behavior is gaussian , while the unbinding transition occurs at some finite value of the attractive potential , @xmath73 , which corresponds to an infrared unstable fixed point of the @xmath74-function .",
