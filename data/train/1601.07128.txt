    "following the discovery of superconductivity by kammerlingh onnes in 1911 , efforts in the search for new superconducting materials during the past century have shown that most of the pure metals and an enormous number of alloys and compounds become superconducting at low temperatures . the highest superconducting critical temperature _",

    "it has been broadly used as a strategy to tune physical properties of materials including electronic transport , magnetic , thermal , mechanical , and luminescent properties .",
    "chemical substitution has been found to induce superconductivity via electron or hole doping in @xmath4feaso compounds by replacing f for o @xcite , co for fe @xcite , sr for la @xcite , th for gd @xcite , and also through the introduction of oxygen vacancies @xcite . similar to the @xmath4feaso compounds , it has been reported that electron carriers are essential for the emergence of superconductivity in the bis@xmath1-based materials @xcite . by modifying the blocking layers of the bis@xmath0-based compounds ,",

    "the superconducting properties of bis@xmath0-based compounds are also sensitive to the environment in which they are synthesized or being measured .",
    "for example , polycrystalline samples of lao@xmath7f@xmath8bis@xmath0 subjected to high pressure ( hp ) annealing have @xmath3 values significantly higher than as - grown ( ag ) samples .",
    "also , with the application of external hydrostatic pressure , a monotonic decrease in @xmath3 is observed for both the bi@xmath11o@xmath11s@xmath10 and srfbis@xmath0 compounds @xcite ; in contrast , the compounds _ _ ln__o@xmath7f@xmath8bis@xmath0 , eu@xmath10bi@xmath0s@xmath11f@xmath11 , eufbis@xmath0 , lao@xmath12f@xmath12bise@xmath0 and sr@xmath12la@xmath12fbis@xmath0 were reported to have a sharp jump in @xmath3 under applied pressure , indicating a pressure - induced transition from a low-@xmath3 to high-@xmath3 superconductor phase @xcite .",

    "@xmath3 values of the samples with the same nominal chemical composition are not always the same since there might be slight differences in the actual chemical composition .    at present , there have been more than one hundred research papers published regarding superconductivity in the bis@xmath0-based compounds , which have helped increase our understanding of these novel materials and superconductivity in general . the peculiar crystal structure of these bis@xmath1-based compounds as a landscape for studying and optimizing superconductivity has fostered a healthy competition within the scientific community to explore the important critical parameters that affect @xmath3 as well as to understand the nature of superconductivity itself in these layered structures . in this article , we will review some of the recent progress in both the study of chemical substitution and external pressure effects on the bis@xmath0-based compounds .",
    "discussions about some of the parameters that are essential for superconductivity in these compounds will also be presented .",
    "as the first discovered superconductor in the bis@xmath0-based compounds , bi@xmath11o@xmath11s@xmath10 is a bulk superconductor with a @xmath3 of about 4.5 k @xcite . the structure of bi@xmath11o@xmath11s@xmath10 is derived from the structure of the parent bi@xmath13o@xmath14s@xmath15 with a 50% deficiency in so@xmath11 units ; this results in the presence of electron carriers in the bis@xmath1 layers which induce the superconductivity in bi@xmath11o@xmath11s@xmath10 @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that the chemical pressure generated by ag substitution is negligible in bi@xmath11o@xmath11s@xmath10 and the suppression of @xmath3 most likely arises from the substitution of the ag ions into the superconducting bis@xmath0 layers and the resultant change in the electronic structure of the compound .",

    "although conclusive evidence of inhomogeneity in polycrystalline samples of the bis@xmath0-based superconductors has not been reported , measurements of electrical resistivity ( @xmath27 ) , magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath28 ) , and specific heat ( @xmath29 ) , etc . may still be partially affected by possible inhomogeneity of the samples , and thus compromise reports of some of the intrinsic properties of these compounds .",

    "this has implications for the behavior of superconductivity under external pressure as being fundamentally different when compared to the behavior of superconductivity in response to chemical substitution in the bis@xmath1-based compounds . as an example",
    ", it was reported that a structural phase transition from the tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase occurs at @xmath160.7 gpa in lao@xmath12f@xmath12bis@xmath0 under pressure , whereas it is known that all bis@xmath1-based superconductors at ambient pressure exhibit the tetragonal phase , including those compounds subject to heavy chemical substitution . as another example , the @xmath3 of ag samples of lao@xmath12f@xmath12bis@xmath0 increases with a reduction in the lattice parameter @xmath24 through a partial or full replacement of la with heavier ( smaller ) _ ln _ , whereas further reduction of the lattice parameter @xmath24 by increasing external hydrostatic pressure up to 1.5 gpa results in a gradual decrease in the @xmath3 of la@xmath63sm@xmath62o@xmath12f@xmath12bis@xmath0 @xcite .",
