    "nine of these systems are defined as compact bh x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) with short orbital periods ( @xmath3 0.5 d ) and low - mass donors ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "it was estimated that there may exist @xmath5 compact bhxbs in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the short orbital periods of bh low - mass x - ray binaries ( bhlmxbs ) imply that they must have undergone secular orbital angular momentum loss .",
    "if their progenitor systems contains a low - mass secondary initially , it is not clear whether the secondary star has enough energy to eject the envelope of the black hole progenitor during the common envelope evolution phase @xcite .",
    "this difficulty can not be dealt with by assuming a intermediate - mass secondary , which have radiative envelope and are not expected to be subject to magnetic braking @xcite , since the binary orbits will be widen when mass is transferred from the less massive secondary to the more massive bh ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that these systems may be evolved from triple systems via the merging of the two massive components .",
    "@xcite proposed that massive thorne - ytkow objects could lead to the birth of bhs with a low - mass donor star .",
    "@xcite summarized the previous proposals for the formation of bhlmxbs .",
    "they instead suggested that bhxbs containing intermediate - mass ap and bp donor stars , which possess strong magnetic fields , may be driven to compact bhlmxbs via magnetic braking with an irradiation - driven wind from the donor star ( see however , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "are there additional angular momentum loss mechanisms for bhxbs besides magnetic braking ? here we explore an alternative possibility .",
    "it is well known that some fraction of the transferred matter from the donor star may leave the system in various ways during the mass exchange process @xcite . in particular , for cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , @xcite and @xcite suggested that part of the outflow may be in the form of a circumbinary ( cb ) disc , and investigated the influence of the cb disc on the evolution of cvs .",
    "the similar idea was adopted by @xcite for bhxbs to regulate the mass transfer rates , in which the cb disc could result from the remnants of the previous common - envelope phase . in our previous works we have investigated the evolution of neutron star ( ns ) lmxbs and algol type binaries with a cb disc @xcite .",
    "these works indicate that the presence of a cb disc can accelerate the evolution process of the binary systems , enhance the mass transfer rates , and lead to secular orbit shrinking under certain conditions .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the influence of the cb disc on the evolution of bh intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( bhimxbs ) , and explore the possibility of bhimxbs being the progenitor systems of short period bhlmxbs .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the adopted orbital angular momentum loss mechanisms in the evolution model of bhimxbs . in section 3",
    "we present the numerically calculated results for the evolutionary sequences .",
    "we summarize and discuss the uncertainties in our model in section 4 .",
    "although some bhxbs may form dynamically in globular clusters @xcite , we only consider those evolved from the primordial massive binary systems .",
    "we focus on the evolution of bhxbs consisting of an intermediate - mass donor star ( of mass @xmath6 ) and a black hole ( of mass @xmath7 ) . neglecting the spin angular momenta of both components ,",
    "we consider three types of angular momentum loss from the binary system ( in all calculations , magnetic braking mechanism is not included ) , which are described as follows",
    ".      for a compact bhxbs gravitational wave radiation is able to carry away orbital angular momentum effectively and lead to mass transfer",
    ". the angular momentum loss rate due to gravitational radiation is given by @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 the speed of light , @xmath11 the total mass of the binary , @xmath12 the binary separation given by the kepler s third law @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the orbital angular velocity of the binary system .",
    "mass and orbital angular momentum loss may occur during rapid mass transfer phase , since the mass accretion rate of a black hole is limited by eddington mass - accretion rate . for spherical accretion ,",
    "this maximum accretion rate can be derived from the equation that gravity can balance the radiation pressure : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron scattering opacity for a composition with hydrogen mass fraction x @xcite .",
    "the energy release efficiency @xmath17 of disc accretion onto black hole can be approximately written as : @xmath18 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the initial mass of the bh ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from the above equations , @xcite obtained the expression of the eddington mass - accretion rate for a disc - fed bh : @xmath21    in our calculations we assume that the transferred matter in excess of the eddington accretion rate is ejected in the vicinity of the bh in the form of isotropic winds , carrying away the specific orbital angular momentum of the bh .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath22 to describe the fraction of mass loss from the binary system , defined by the following relations : @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total mass - loss rate from the system , @xmath26 is the mass transfer rate from the secondary , and @xmath27 is the mass accretion rate of the black hole , respectively . if the mass transfer rate @xmath28 , @xmath29 , else @xmath30 .",
    "based on the above equations and assumptions , the angular momentum loss rate via isotropic winds is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total orbital angular momentum and @xmath33 is the reduced mass of the binary system , respectively .",
    "we further assume that a small fraction @xmath0 of the material overflowed from the donor star s roche - lobe _ always _ feeds into the cb disc rather accretes onto the bh .",

    "* ) . in the calculations we set initial solar chemical compositions ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ) for the donor stars , and take the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height to be 2.0 .",
    "we include the afore - mentioned three types of orbital angular momentum loss mechanisms during the binary evolution . for the cb disc ,",
    "we take @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite . setting the initial mass of the bh @xmath69",
    ", we have performed the evolution calculations of bhxbs with an initial secondary of @xmath70 , 4 , and 5 @xmath71 .",
    "we first estimate the possible range of the fractional mass input rate into the cb disc , @xmath0 , when the cb disc s influence on the orbital evolution of bhimxbs is effective . from eq .",
    "( 10 ) we find the viscous timescale @xmath72 yr at the inner edge of the cb disc for a bh binary with an orbital period of @xmath73 d , and the duration of rlof @xmath74 yr , so we get @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( 14 ) . for systems with an initial orbital period of @xmath76",
    "d , @xmath77 yr , and @xmath78 . obviously the longer @xmath40 , the smaller @xmath0 required .",
    "these values of @xmath0 seem to be in agreement with @xcite who have shown that the cb disc is effective in draining orbital angular momentum from the system provided that @xmath0 exceeds about 0.01 . in our calculations",
    "we find that cb discs with @xmath79 ( depending on the initial orbital periods ) will cause runaway mass transfer with high mass transfer rates , while the evolutions with @xmath0 significantly less than 0.01 is similar to those without cb discs , as already noticed in cv evolution @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the examples of the evolutionary sequence with an initial orbital period of 1 d. the solid and dotted lines in the figure correspond to two different values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "as can seen in the figure , mass transfer is initially driven by nuclear evolution of the secondary , leading to expansion of the orbits . but this tendency is held up when the angular momentum loss via the cb disc becomes sufficiently strong .",
    "the mass transfer drops into a  plateau \" phase at a rate @xmath82 for a few @xmath83 yr . these features are different from those in @xcite for the standard evolution of bhimxbs , in which the orbits always increase secularly . after that the mass transfer rates increase sharply as the secondary ascends the giant branch , but the final orbital evolution depends on the adopted value of @xmath0 . with the higher value of @xmath0",
    ", a compact bhlmxb will be finally produced after a few @xmath83 yr mass transfer .",
    "if matter does not leave the cb disc , we can estimate from fig .",
    "2 the mass of cb disc @xmath84 , 0.028 , @xmath85 with the initial donor mass of 3 , 4 , @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the calculated results for slightly wider initial orbital period of 3 d are presented in fig .",
    "generally the mass transfer rates are higher for higher donor masses and wider initial orbits - the peaks of the mass transfer rates can reach @xmath87 . within less than 1 myr",
    "the donor masses decrease to be @xmath88 .",
    "short orbital periods can also be attained , but generally a larger @xmath0 ( up to @xmath89 ) is required compared with those in fig .  2 .",
    "in this case the the cb disc is also more massive , @xmath90 , 0.28 , @xmath91 with the initial donor mass of 3 , 4 , @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "one may expect that the cb disc may play a similar role in the evolution of nslmxbs . in fig .  4",
    ", we plot the evolutionary sequence of nslmxbs with a donor star of @xmath92 and an initial orbital period of @xmath93 d , to show the similar influence of changing @xmath0 on the final orbital evolution as in bh binaries . in our previous work on the formation of the binary radio pulsar psr j1713@xmath940747 @xcite",
    "we have found that for a given final orbital period , including the cb disc can allow a more evolved donor star at the onset of mass transfer , so that the x - ray lifetime can be considerably decreased .",
    "all of the bhlmxbs with an orbital period of @xmath95 d should be transient sources @xcite .",
    "it is currently believed that the transient behavior in x - ray binaries is due to the thermal - viscous instability of accretion discs , when the mass transfer rates lie below a critical value @xmath96 so that the surface temperature at the outer edge of accretion disc is lower than the hydrogen ionization temperature @xcite .",
    "this critical mass transfer rate depends primarily on @xmath97 , @xmath63 , and @xmath98 , and is given by @xcite : @xmath99 in fig .",
    "2 the thick and thin curves correspond to stable and unstable mass transfer during the evolution of bhxbs .",
    "however , the mass transfer would be always stable for the wide orbit system with an initial orbital period of 3 d ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the model bhlmxbs are likely to be persistent x - ray sources .",
    "this is not compatible with the observations of galactic bhlmxbs , suggesting that @xmath0 does not need to be constant but changes during the evolution ( see discussion below ) yr @xcite .",
    "this source could be a soft x - ray transient with long duration of outbursts .",
    "however , a persistent x - ray source as suggested by our calculations is an alternative possibility . ] .",
    "in this paper we have examined the influence of a cb disc on the evolution of bhimxbs . assuming that a fraction @xmath0 of the transferred material from the secondary forms a cb disc surrounding the binary system and extracts the orbital angular momentum from the binary , we have performed evolution calculations for bhxbs containing a donor star of mass in the range from 3 to 5 @xmath71 with an initial orbital period of 1 d and 3 d. the calculations show that the evolution of bhimxb is sensitive to @xmath0 . generally a larger @xmath0 is required for a wider initial orbit since the mass transfer itself during the evolution always causes orbital expansion .",
    "the results indicate that the orbits of bhxbs would show secular shrinkage when the values of @xmath0 lie in the range of a few @xmath100 .",
    "thus our cb disc scenario suggests a new evolutionary channel for the formation of bhlmxbs from bhimxbs .    however , our results encounter the similar difficulty as in @xcite , that the calculated effective temperatures @xmath101 are not consistent with those of the observed donor stars in bhlmxbs .",
    "we compare the calculated results of both bh - lmxbs and imxbs with the observations in the @xmath102 - @xmath98 diagram in fig .",
    "one can see that the observed results seem to be more consistent with the evolutionary tracks of original bhlmxbs .",
    "@xcite have already pointed out that this tempreature discrepancy seems to be a generic difficulty with any formation scenario that invokes primordially intermediate - mass donor stars .",
    "if this effective temperature problem can be solved , the cb disc mechanism may provide a plausible solution to the bhlmxb formation problem , without requiring anomalous magnetic fields in the donor stars .",
    "the mechanism feeding the cb disc is still unclear .",
    "it has been argued that during mass exchange in binary systems , some of the lost matter which possesses high orbital angular momentum may form a disc surrounding the binary system rather than leave the binary system @xcite .",
    "this part of matter may come from the stellar wind from the donor star , wind and/or outflow from the accretion disc , or mass lost from the outer lagrangian point .",
    "the values of @xmath0 adopted here seem to rule out stellar wind as the origin of the cb disc , which requires a unreasonably high wind mass loss rate in intermediate- and low - mass stars .",
    "we speculate that the disc wind / outflow may play a more important role in feeding the cb disc , as the x - ray irradiation on the accretion disc in bhxbs may evaporate the disc much more efficiently than in cvs .",
    "this may explain why the values of @xmath0 are about @xmath103 orders of magnitude larger than those for cv evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the structure and evolution of a geometrically thin cb disc to calculate its spectral energy distributions , and discussed the prospects for the detection of such discs in the infrared and submillimeter wavelength regions .",
    "@xcite searched for excess mid - infrared emission due to cb disc material in cvs . but direct detection of the cb discs in cvs by infrared continuum studies has so far been elusive , partly because of the lack of accurate disc atmosphere models .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the blackbody spectrum of bhlmxbs a 0620 - 00 and xte j1118 + 480 , and found that the inferred excess mid - infrared emitting areas are @xmath104 times larger than the binary orbital separations .",
    "therefore , the detection of excess mid - infrared emission from these bhlmxbs provides evidence of the existence of cb disc around some bhlmxbs .",
    "these observations may set useful constraints on the evolution of the cb discs .",
    "the masses of the model cb disc are significantly larger than those ( @xmath105 ) estimated by @xcite . combined with the non - detection of discs in cvs by @xcite , this fact suggests that the presence of the cb disc may not always accompany the rlof processes . for example , ( x - ray ) nova bursts may destroy the cb disc before it has developed to be massive enough . or perhaps @xmath0 only needs to be high for a short time , while normal magnetic braking takes over the cb disc during the majority of the evolution . the latter may partly account for the discrepancy between the lifetimes of bhlmxbs in fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath106 yr ) and those expected for observed bhlmxbs ( @xmath107 yr ) . since the cb disc can promote mass transfer very efficiently , bhlmxbs are more likely to be observed when the value of @xmath0 becomes extremely small .",
