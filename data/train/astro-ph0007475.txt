    "it has been proposed that powerful frii ( see fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxies and radio loud quasars are intrinsically the same objects , with all observed differences being a result of the angle between the line of sight and the radio axis ( scheuer 1987 ; barthel 1989 ) .",
    "while objects classified as `` narrow - line radio galaxies '' do not display obvious broad lines in their optical spectra , broad lines have been seen either in the near - infrared ( e.g.  hill , goodrich & depoy 1996 ) or in polarized light ( e.g.  young et al .",
    "in addition , the detection of unresolved nuclei in near - infrared observations of radio galaxies ( e.g.  djorgovski et al .  1991 ; simpson , ward & wilson 1995 ) , where the optical depth is lower , indicates the presence of a quasar - like nucleus in the centres of these objects . since quasars can outshine their host galaxies by factors ranging from a few ( e.g.  dunlop et al .",
    "1993 ; taylor et al.1996 , hereafter t96 ) to more than 100 in extreme cases ( e.g.  pds  456 ; simpson et al .",
    "1999 ) , even if only a few per cent of the nuclear light is transmitted it can still make a major contribution to the integrated luminosity .",
    "it has long been known that the brightest radio galaxies , i.e.  those in the 3crr catalogue of laing , riley & longair ( 1983 ) , are brighter in the near - infrared by about a magnitude at @xmath4 than they are at low redshift .",
    "this amount of dimming as cosmic time increases is consistent with passive evolution of their stellar populations ( lilly & longair 1984 ; lilly , longair & allington - smith 1985b ) . while some 3c radio galaxies at @xmath4 suffer significant contamination from non - stellar radiation ( rawlings et al .",
    "1995 ; simpson , rawlings & lacy 1999 ) , this does not have a significant impact on the locus of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation . however , radio galaxies from the fainter 6c and b2 radio surveys are 0.6mag fainter at @xmath0 than the 3c objects at these redshifts ( eales et al .",
    "1997 ) , whereas there is no correlation between radio and host galaxy luminosities locally .",
    "furthermore , the 6c / b2 galaxies lie _ below _ the no - evolution curve .",
    "the possibility that there is significant non - stellar contamination at _ low _ redshift is one that therefore needs to be investigated .",
    "a study by t96 claimed that the true locus of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation at low redshift may be half a magnitude fainter than previously thought due to contamination from the non - stellar nucleus . in this paper , we perform a similar analysis to that of t96 on an unbiased sample of radio galaxies from the catalogue of laing et al .",
    "( 1983 ) . in section  2",
    "we describe our sample selection and observational technique . in section  3",
    "we briefly describe the two - dimensional fitting procedure used to separate the nuclear and host galaxy properties in our @xmath5 and @xmath0 images , and present the results of this analysis , together with aperture photometry of the longer - wavelength images . in section  4",
    "we use these results to examine the nature of the stellar and non - stellar components of radio galaxies , and infer the intrinsic luminosities of the nuclear sources and the line of sight obscurations towards them . in section  5",
    "we attempt to infer the geometry of this obscuring material , and in section  6 we discuss the implications of our analysis on the low - redshift end of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation and compare our results with those of t96 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  7 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath6kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "our convention for spectral index , @xmath10 , is such that the flux density at a frequency @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we selected our targets from the 3crr catalogue of laing et al.(1983 ) .",
    "this catalogue is essentially complete and , by virtue of being selected at low frequency , does not preferentially include sources observed close to the radio axis whose fluxes are enhanced by doppler boosted cores .",
    "it is therefore an unbiased sample of radio galaxies , except in the sense that it consists of the most radio - luminous objects .",
    "we excluded objects with known broad h@xmath10 , as determined by the high - quality spectrophotometric observations of laing et al.(1994 , hereafter l94 ) ; we did not however exclude 3c  234 since the broad h@xmath10 seen is believed to be entirely scattered ( antonucci 1984 ; young et al .",
    "this criterion supplied an upper redshift cutoff of @xmath13 , in order that h@xmath10 still be present in the optical spectra . from those objects visible from the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in early january",
    ", we selected only those galaxies with strong optical emission lines ( class  a ; hine & longair 1979 ) .",
    "the reasons for this were twofold .",
    "first , the low - ionization ( `` optically dull '' , class  b ) radio galaxies may not be part of the quasar  radio galaxy unification paradigm ",
    "they are predominantly low - power objects with an fri radio morphology .",
    "secondly , since emission - line luminosity is a good indicator of the power of the active nucleus ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) , it follows that these objects will have less luminous nuclei in the near - infrared and are therefore likely to be below our detection threshold .",
    "we were able to observe ten of the eleven objects thus selected , with 3c  123 being excluded from our programme solely because it was never at a suitable hour angle when the time came to choose the next target .",
    "we present details of the sample in table  [ tab : sample ] , including observed 178mhz and  @xmath145007 fluxes and rest frame luminosities .",
    "although the data of l94 is of a consistently high quality , their choice of a narrow slit necessarily meant a loss of extended emission line flux .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced in the closest radio galaxies , where the line emission can be extended over many arcseconds ( see , e.g. , baum et al .",
    "we have therefore chosen not to use fluxes from l94 s data in those cases where a larger aperture measurement is available that contains a significantly larger flux .",
    "we were unable to locate large aperture measurements for 3c  42 or 3c  153 , although these are the two most distant objects in our sample and we can expect the spectroscopic slit of l94 to include virtually all the line emission .       the first step in our procedure is to determine the distribution of the transverse core dominance parameter , @xmath15 .",
    "we construct synthetic samples of 5000 radio sources which are randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight , and have the logarithms of their transverse core dominance parameters , @xmath16 , drawn from a normal distribution , whose mean and standard deviation we vary to determine the best fit to the observed data .",
    "we quantify the goodness - of - fit using the peto - prentice generalized wilcoxon test ( latta 1981 ; feigelson & nelson 1985 ) , as employed in the asurv package within iraf / stsdas . of the various tests feigelson & nelson list to compare two samples of censored data , this is believed to be the least affected by differences in sample size and censoring patterns , which is important here since our synthetic sample is much larger than the real dataset and suffers no censoring .",
    "the best fit we find is when the transverse core dominance parameter is drawn from the distribution @xmath17 , with the probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same population being 99.9% .",
    "both versions of the gehan test ( also available in asurv ) produce the same result , so it is not sensitive to the specific test used .",
    "note that the underlying distribution , @xmath18 , reported by simpson ( 1998b ) was computed using a few older core flux measurements ( generally upper limits which have been superseded by more sensitive limits or faint detections ) , and with a different goodness - of - fit statistic .",
    "however , there is only a slight difference between the two distributions , which does not affect the results in that paper .",
    "having derived a distribution function for @xmath16 , it becomes possible to infer the probability distribution of viewing angles , @xmath19 .",
    "bayes theorem informs us that @xmath20 since @xmath21 and @xmath22 are directly related by @xmath15 , we can write the first term on the right hand side as an _ a priori _ probability that @xmath15 lies in the appropriate range to produce the observed value of @xmath21 given that the viewing angle lies in the interval between @xmath22 and @xmath23 . if we define @xmath24 , it is trivial to show that @xmath25 .",
    "hence , @xmath26 and , straightforwardly , @xmath27    finally , we need to consider the _ a priori _ distribution of viewing angles , @xmath28 .",
    "a natural choice , motivated by the radio galaxy ",
    "quasar unification scenarios , would be to assume that @xmath29 for angles greater than some critical angle , @xmath30 , and zero for angles less than this . in practice ,",
    "the actual choice of @xmath30 has little effect on the results , except for sources with bright radio cores , such as 3c  234 , when the probability distribution of angles piles up at the critical angle . rather than adopt an _",
    "ad hoc _ formulation to create a smooth transition at @xmath31 and prevent this unrealistic behaviour , we choose @xmath32 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath33 under these assumptions is shown graphically in fig .",
