    "leptonic decays of charged pions and leptonic and semileptonic decays of kaons are responsible for the lepton fluxes , the so - called `` conventional '' lepton flux .",
    "currently , it is believed that the conventional flux dominates until energies of about @xmath6 tev , when the effects of atmospheric charm production and decay become important contributions to the lepton fluxes .",
    "the issue of where the charm contributions dominate is of interest , in part , because this is an energy regime accessible to large underground experiments @xcite .",
    "recent results from frjus @xcite , baksan @xcite and other experiments @xcite show an excess relative to the conventional muon flux in the 10 tev energy range .",
    "this may be an indication of a charm contribution at lower energies that expected .",
    "one of the main goals of the neutrino experiments such as amanda @xcite , antares @xcite , nestor @xcite and at lake baikal @xcite are searches for muon neutrinos from extragalactic neutrino sources for which atmospheric neutrinos and muons present the main background .",
    "lepton fluxes from atmospheric charm have been calculated previously @xcite for specific models of charm particle production . here , we calculate the leptonic flux from charm in the context of perturbative qcd .",
    "we include next - to - leading order radiative corrections and we study the importance of small-@xmath0 behavior of the parton distribution functions .",
    "we emphasize the uncertainties inherent in the necessary extrapolation of cross sections and energy distributions beyond the experimentally measured regime .",
    "we use the comparison with low - energy charm production data to constraint some of the theoretical uncertainties , such as the charm quark mass and the factorization and renormalization scale dependence .",
    "we compare our results to the earlier work on the prompt muons from charm including a recent calculation @xcite calculated using pythia monte carlo program @xcite .    in the next section ,",

    "we emphasize that the prompt flux is isotropic except at the highest energies , while the conventional flux is not .",
    "we have also estimated the flux due to pion - air interactions creating charm pairs .",

    "nlo effects in the tig calculation are accounted for by an energy and @xmath29 independent factor of 2 .",
    "overall , the net effect is that the tig @xmath62 is nearly energy independent .    the prompt muon flux by volkova _ et al . _ @xcite is larger than our calculated flux .",

    "these inputs are not consistent with perturbative qcd .",
    "the experimental excess of muons can not be accounted for by perturbative qcd production of charm .",
    "another implication of the prompt fluxes calculated here is the ratio of the muon neutrino to electron neutrino flux .",

    "we find that the nlo corrections give a correction of more than a factor of two which is weakly energy and @xmath29 dependent .",
    "nuclear shadowing corrections are small for all energies , due to the air nucleus being relatively light .",
    "the main uncertainty in the perturbative calculation of the prompt flux , given fixed charm mass , factorization scale and renormalization scale , is the small-@xmath0 behavior of the parton distribution functions .",
    "different choices of scales and distribution functions , extrapolated to low @xmath0 with the same power law dependence as for @xmath186 , yield as much as a factor of @xmath175 discrepancy in the prompt flux at @xmath138 gev .    if the parton distributions are flattened below some critical value @xmath187 according to eq .",

    "the flux is @xmath193% of our calculated value at @xmath70 gev .",
    "however , such an abrupt turnover in the power law behavior of the small-@xmath0 parton distributions is unlikely .",
    "we conclude that the prompt muon flux calculated in the context of perturbative qcd can not explain the observed excess of muons in the tev region @xcite , independent of the theoretical uncertainties associated with small parton @xmath0 . however , prompt fluxes calculated using non - perturbative models of charm production such as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite could provide a muon excess in that energy range .",
    "measurements of the atmospheric flux in the 100 tev range would help pin down the charm cross section at energies above those currently accessible using accelerators and would provide valuable information about the small-@xmath0 behavior of the gluon distribution function .    even though the prompt contributions to the lepton fluxes change the energy behavior of the differential fluxes by a factor of @xmath17 , the atmospheric neutrino fluxes do not compete with neutrino fluxes from extragalactic sources above 10 tev @xcite .",
    "possible oscillations of muon neutrinos as indicated by the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite do not affect our results due to the extremely small oscillation probability for the energies of interest .",
