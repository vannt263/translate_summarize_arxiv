    "the study of giant planets in our solar system has been recently augmented by the growing body of mass and radius measurements for transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "these measurements have enabled the first studies of the heavy element components of gas giants orbiting other stars , as has been done for the super - neptune hats-7b  @xcite and the hot saturn hd 149026b  @xcite , and in the statistical characterization of heavy - element enrichment in extrasolar gas giant planets  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . nonetheless , characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets@xmath9 in particular , determining the presence of a heavy element core@xmath9remains challenging , since mass and radius measurements alone can not in general uniquely constrain the interior density profile nor the chemical makeup of a planet . in particular",
    ", determining whether heavy elements are concentrated in the core or distributed uniformly within the envelope is especially difficult for jupiter - sized planets since the large , predominantly light - element envelope masks the signal of the radial distribution of heavy elements .",
    "however , the orbital configuration in a subset of multi - planet systems is such that the dynamical evolution of the system depends on the love number ( @xmath10 ) of its innermost planet  @xcite .",
    "the love number ( @xmath10 ) quantifies the elastic deformation response of a planet to external forces and thus encodes information about its interior structure , including clues about its core mass  @xcite . utilizing the secular theory of  @xcite",

    "the hat - p-13 system is the first and only currently known system to fulfill these criteria .",

    "we combine these new secondary eclipse times with the most recent transit and radial velocity measurements of the system  @xcite in order to derive an improved constraint on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",

    "finally , we discuss the implications of our findings in section 4 .",

    "each dataset comprises 68,608 sub - array images taken with 0.4 s integration times over 8.7 hours of observation .",
    "we extract the utc - based barycentric julian date ( bjd@xmath20 ) , subtract the sky background , and remove transient hot pixels from each of the images as described in  @xcite and  @xcite . to calculate the flux from the hat - p-13 system in each image",
    ", we first estimate the position of the star on the array using the flux - weighted centroid method  @xcite with radii ranging between 2.0 - 5.0 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments .",
    "we then calculate the corresponding stellar flux using a circular aperture with either a fixed or time - varying radius .",
    "we consider fixed radii ranging between 2.0 - 5.0 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments , and calculate the time - varying aperture using the square root of the noise pixel parameter as described in  @xcite .",
    "this parameter is proportional to the full width at half max ( fwhm ) of the star s point spread function , and is calculated for each image using a circular aperture with radii ranging between 2.0 - 5.0 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments .",
    "we then either multiply the square root of the noise pixel parameter by a constant scaling value of [ 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.85 , 0.9 , 0.95 , 1.00 , 1.05 , 1.10 , 1.15 , or 1.20 ] pixels or add a constant offset of [ -0.9 , -0.8 , -0.7 , -0.6 , -0.5 , -0.4 , -0.3 , -0.2 , -0.1 , 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , or 0.5 ] pixels in order to determine the aperture radius for each image .",
    "we next create a time series for each photometric aperture where we trim the first 90 minutes ( 11,904 images ) of each time series in order to remove the well - known ramp that occurs at the start of each new telescope pointing  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we replace non - numerical ( nan ) flux values with the median flux value of each time series and replace values that deviate by more than three standard deviations from the local mean , determined from the nearest 100 points , with the local mean .",
    "we compare this approach to one in which we instead trim outliers from our light curves and find that our best - fit eclipse depths and times change by less than 0.2 sigma in both channels .",
    "0.2% of the measurements were outliers or nan in each channel .",
    "we then normalize each time series to one by dividing by the median value .",
    "the photometric time series in both channels is dominated by an instrumental effect related to irac s well - known intrapixel sensitivity variations , combined with the pointing oscillation of the @xmath19 .",
    "we correct for this effect using pixel level decorrelation ( pld ) , as described by  @xcite .",
    "this method models the variation in flux intensity in each image due to this instrumental effect by tracking the change in intensity over time within a small box of pixels centered on the flux - weighted centroid .",
    "we use a total of nine pixels arranged in a 3x3 box centered on the position of the stellar centroid .",
    "we remove images from the time series where one of these nine pixels deviates from its mean flux by more than 3@xmath21 ( 0.3% of the data at 3.6 @xmath8 m and 0.1% of the data at 4.5 @xmath8 m ) .",
    "most of these deviations correlate with large pointing excursions in the photometric time series .",
    "we identify two pointing excursions in the 3.6 @xmath8 m data , one of 0.7 pixels for 10 s and one of 0.5 pixels for 20 s , and one of 0.9 pixels for 10 s the 4.5 @xmath8 m data .",
    "we divide the flux in each individual pixel by the summed flux across all nine pixels , weighting each pixel by its contribution to the flux and thereby isolating the instrument noise from astrophysical signals  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and repeat this operation for each image in our photometric time series .",
    "we also incorporate a constant and a linear term in time to model baseline instrument noise . unlike  @xcite",
    ", we do not include a quadratic term because we found that the linear fit has an equivalent rms ( root mean square residual ) to the quadratic fit and so adding the quadratic parameter is not justified .",
    "in addition , the quadratic term was correlated with the eclipse depth in our model fits .",
    "we fit a combined instrumental noise and eclipse  @xcite model to the light curve for each combination of photometric apertures listed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : aquisition ] using the ` leastsq ' routine in scipy v0.14.0 with python 2.7.6 and examine the residuals from the best - fit solution in order to determine the optimal aperture set for each bandpass . as discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , we first bin the photometric light curves and time series for individual pixels by a factor of 512 ( @xmath224 minute intervals ) before fitting the model , then apply the resulting best - fit model coefficients to the unbinned light curve .",
    "this allows us to identify solutions that minimize noise on longer time scales , which are most important for determining the best - fit eclipse parameters , in exchange for a moderately higher scatter in the unbinned residuals .",
    "we allow the center of eclipse time , eclipse depth , pixel weights , constant , and linear terms to vary as free parameters in our fits .",
    "we excluded from consideration any apertures with an unbinned rms more than 1.1 times that of the aperture with the lowest rms in each band , focusing instead on the subset of apertures with low scatter .",
    "we then compared the relative amounts of time - correlated or `` red '' noise in the remaining apertures by calculating the standard deviation of the residuals as a function of bin size . for light curves with minimal red noise",
    ", we would expect the standard deviation of the residuals to vary by the @xmath23 gaussian scaling relation  @xcite where @xmath24 is the number of points in each bin and @xmath25 is the number of bins .",
    "we evaluate the actual amount of red noise in the time series for each aperture by calculating the least - squares difference between the observed and theoretical noise scaling ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rootn ] ) and select the aperture that minimizes this quantity in each bandpass .",
    "we next find the optimal bin size to use to fit the lightcurve in each channel via the same least - squares approach with which we find the optimal aperture . after determining the optimal bin size in each bandpass , we repeat our aperture optimization at the new bin size .",
    "we iterate on searching for the optimal aperture and bin size until we converge on the optimal pairing of aperture and bin size for each bandpass .    after optimizing our choice of bin size and aperture",
    ", we found that the 4.5 @xmath8 m light curve displayed a residual ramp - like signal despite our decision to trim the first 90 minutes of data .",
    "we therefore experimented with fits where we trimmed up to 3 hours of data from the start of the light curve ( i.e. , up to the beginning of the eclipse ) .",
    "we found that the best - fit eclipse times were correlated with the amount of data trimmed from the start of the light curve over the full range of trim durations considered , indicating that the ramp extended to the start of the eclipse .",
    "we then considered an alternative approach in which we returned to our original 90 minute trim duration and deliberately used larger than optimal bin sizes in our fits , effectively forcing the models to identify solutions with less structure on long time scales .",
    "we found that fits with bin sizes larger than 100 points ( 40 s ) effectively removed the ramp from the light curve , avoiding the need to increase the trim interval to values larger than 90 minutes .",
    "these fits resulted in best - fit secondary eclipse times approximately 2 minutes ( 0.6 @xmath21 ) earlier than our original fits with a smaller bin size .",
    "we tested for a residual ramp by repeating the large bin size fits with trim intervals ranging from 30 minutes up to 3 hours , and found no evidence for a correlation between the trim interval and the best - fit eclipse time .",
    "we then repeated our optimization for bin size considering bin sizes between 128 - 2048 points in powers of two .",
    "we found that our best - fit eclipse depths and times varied by less than 0.4@xmath21 across this range , and were in good agreement with the best - fit values for the 3-hour trim interval using the smaller bin size .",
    "we also considered fits using a smaller bin size where we included an exponential function of time to account for the observed ramp , but found that this exponential function was a poor match for the shape of the observed ramp .",
    "we speculate that a sum of several exponentials might provide a better fit  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but felt that the added free parameters were not justified given the success of using larger bin sizes .",
    "we also find that enforcing larger bin sizes in the 4.5 @xmath8 m channel leads to better agreement of the secondary eclipse timing between the two channels .",
    "we also tried decorrelating instrumental noise in our data using pixel - mapping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this non - parametric technique constructs an empirical map of the pixel response across the chip by comparing the measured flux from each image to those of other images with similar stellar positions .",
    "we model the pixel sensitivity at each point in our time series using a gaussian spatial weighting function over the 50 nearest neighbors in stellar centroid @xmath26 and @xmath27 position and noise pixel parameter space .",
    "the inclusion of the noise pixel parameter in the weighting ensures that the pixel map incorporates systematics unrelated to changes in the star s position that affect the shape of the stellar point - spread function .",
    "the number of neighbors was chosen to be large enough to adequately map the pixel response across the range of star positions in each eclipse data set while maintaining a reasonably low computational overhead @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that pld is generally more effective in removing time - correlated ( i.e. , red ) noise than other decorrelation methods as long as the range of star positions across the data set remains below @xmath220.2  pixels .",
    "the range of star centroid positions in our eclipse data sets lies below this threshold , and therefore , we expect pld to perform optimally .",
    "we also directly compare the performance of pld for cases where we fit to either the unbinned or optimally binned photometry , as well as to the fit acquired from photometry using the  @xcite pixel mapping technique described in the previous paragraph .",
    "we find that that the optimally binned pld have lower levels of correlated noise than the other methods ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rootn ] ) .",
    "in addition , binned pld gives center of eclipse phases in the two bandpasses that are most consistent with each other ( at the 1.3@xmath21 level ) ; the unbinned pld and pixel mapping techniques produced center of eclipse phases consistent at the 2.6@xmath21 and 5.0@xmath21 levels , respectively .",
    "we therefore select the pld technique applied to the binned dataset for our final analysis .    for the fits described in the rest of this paper we use the following optimal aperture set and bin size . for the 3.6 @xmath8 m channel",
    "we select a bin size of 21 points ( @xmath228 sec ) , a 3.0 pixel radius aperture to find the centroid , a 2.0 pixel aperture to find the noise pixel parameter , and add 0.3 pixels to the square root of the noise pixel parameter to obtain the aperture within which we sum the flux .",
    "for the 4.5 @xmath8 m channel we select a bin size of 128 points ( @xmath2250 sec ) , a 4.5 pixel radius aperture to find the centroid , a 4.0 pixel aperture to find the noise pixel parameter , and add 0.3 pixels to the square root of the noise pixel parameter to obtain the aperture within which we sum the flux .",
    "we determine the uncertainties on our model parameters using the markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) code emcee v2.1.0",
    "@xcite on python 2.7.6 .",
    "we allow the center of eclipse time , eclipse depth , pixel weights , constant , and linear terms to vary as free parameters in our fits .",
    "we set the uncertainties on individual points in each light curve equal to the standard deviation of the residuals after subtracting the best - fit solution in each bandpass .",
    "we run the mcmc with 250 walkers for 20,000 steps ; the first 5000 steps from each walker were ` burn - in ' steps and removed from the chain .    for the observations in the 4.5 @xmath8 m band we found that the 1@xmath21 uncertainties on the rms overlap with the errors theoretically expected in the absence of correlated noise on the timescale of the eclipse ingress and egress ( 30 min ; fig .",
    "[ fig : rootn ] ) and therefore report the uncertainties in measurements from the 4.5 @xmath8 m band directly from the mcmc analysis .",
    "however , for the observations in the 3.6 @xmath8 m band , the calculated rms consistently deviate above the expected improvement with increased binning for timescales longer than 1 min .",
    "we therefore choose a conservative approach and multiply the uncertainties in the center of eclipse time derived from the mcmc in the 3.6 @xmath8 m band by a factor of 1.3 , the factor by which the rms lies above the theoretical improvement at the 30 min timescale  @xcite . since the timescale of the eclipse is approximately half of the length of the dataset , we are unable to accurately estimate the red noise on that timescale and so adopt the same factor of 1.3 scaling for the eclipse depth uncertainty in this band .",
    "we next calculate an updated value for the eccentricity of hat - p-13b using the approach described in  @xcite .",
    "we fit the available radial velocity observations for this planet from  @xcite simultaneously with the best - fit transit ephemeris from  @xcite and measured secondary eclipse times from this study .",
    "we first allow the apsides of each planet ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) to vary independently and then repeat the fits imposing a prior that the posterior distribution of @xmath28 matches the posterior distribution of @xmath29 that was calculated from the fit in which @xmath28 and @xmath29 were allowed to vary independently .",
    "we use the latter version of the fits in our final analysis , and discuss the rationale for this assumption in sec .",

    "we adopt a solar composition envelope and evolve an array of interior models of hat - p-13b with varying core masses and energy dissipation rates .",
    "specifically , we consider core masses of 0.1 - 80 @xmath6 and dissipation rates equal to 0.05% , 0.10% , or 0.50% of the insolation .",
    "the thermal dissipation range we adopt here encapsulates both ( i ) the energy deposition typically quoted for hot jupiters residing on circular orbits ( e.g. ohmic dissipation , kinetic deposition ) and ( ii ) an additional component of energy arising due to the sustained tidal dissipation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate the insolation ( @xmath30 ) using an equilibrium temperature of 1725 k  @xcite .",

    "* ) is available but that the mass - radius relationship for giant planets is famously independent of mass and so our choice of the  @xcite mass makes a negligible difference in our analysis .",
    "we also note that the errors on the mass are negligible compared to the uncertainties inherent in the equation of state  ( see * ? ? ?",
