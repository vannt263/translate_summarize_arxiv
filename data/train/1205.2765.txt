    "recent discoveries of multi - planet systems from maturing high - precision doppler planet searches are revealing a surprising diversity of planetary system properties . it is becoming apparent that , given a sufficient number of high - precision observations , many seemingly solitary stars or single - planet systems are found to host additional orbiting bodies .",
    "this trend is evident both at extremely low masses ( e.g.  anglada - escud et al .",
    "2012 , mayor et al .  2011 ,",
    "vogt et al .  2010 ) and long periods ( e.g.  hd  134987  c , jones et al .",
    "2010 ; 47  uma  d , gregory & fischer 2010 ) .",
    "confirmation by independent observatories is extremely useful when testing the potential detection of additional planets , particularly if they have small radial - velocity amplitudes or the host star has a high level of velocity jitter .",
    "for example , @xcite reported a third planet in the hd  74156 system using data from the hobby - eberly telescope .",
    "however , using the same spectra processed with two different , independent doppler velocity codes , @xcite could not confirm that planet .",
    "the keck observations presented by @xcite were also inconsistent with a third planet in that system .",
    "high - precision and high - cadence data from multiple sites have proved critical in the confirmation of low - mass planets such as hd  4308 @xcite , the 61  vir three - planet system @xcite , and hd  114613 @xcite . for candidate multiple - planet systems ,",
    "dynamical stability modelling is also a critical tool , since periodic signals arising from observational sampling or stellar activity can be misinterpreted as planets .",
    "the inclusion of rigorous dynamical modelling has recently shown some candidate planetary systems to be unfeasible , e.g.  horner et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , tuomi ( 2011 ) , wittenmyer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "in this work , we present new data from the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) which provide evidence for one additional planet orbiting hd  142 (  3.1 ) with a period of 6005 days .",
    "we also perform a bayesian analysis (  3.2 ) , yielding results that are in agreement with the conventional least squares solution . in section 3.3 , we present aaps and keck data indicating a second planet in the hd  159868 system with an orbital period of 352 days .",
    "these two proposed multi - planet systems are subjected to detailed dynamical testing in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we use direct imaging of the hd142 system to rule out the known stellar companion as the source of the observed radial - velocity signal . finally in section  6 , we place these discoveries in the context of the overall distribution of exoplanet properties and give our conclusions .",
    "aaps doppler measurements are made with the ucles echelle spectrograph @xcite .",
    "keck doppler measurements are made with the hires spectrograph @xcite .",
    "an iodine absorption cell provides wavelength calibration from 5000 to 6200 .",
    "the spectrograph point - spread function and wavelength calibration is derived from the iodine absorption lines embedded on every pixel of the spectrum by the cell @xcite .",
    "the result is a precision doppler velocity estimate for each epoch , along with an internal uncertainty estimate , which includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model , and variation in the underlying spectrum between the iodine - free template , and epoch spectra observed through the iodine cell .",
    "all velocities are measured relative to the zero - point defined by the template observation .",
    "hd  142 has been observed by the aat at 82 epochs , with a total data span of 5067 days .",
    "hd  159868 has been observed by the aat at 47 epochs , with a total data span of 3396 days . in this analysis",
    ", we also add 34 keck epochs spanning 1593 days .",
    "the radial - velocity data for hd  142 are presented in table  [ 142vels ] , and the data for hd  159868 are in tables  [ 159vels ] and [ keckvels ] . the physical parameters of hd  142 are given in @xcite , and those for hd  159868 are given in @xcite .",
    "tables  [ 142star ] and [ 159star ] summarise the parameters for hd  142 and hd  159868 , respectively .",
    "briefly , hd  142 is a g1iv star with a mass of 1.15@xmath00.10 , is possibly slightly evolved @xcite , is chromospherically inactive ( log@xmath3=-4.95 ) , with a moderately rapid rotation rate ( v sin @xmath2=10.4 ) .",
    "hd  159868 is a g5 dwarf with a mass of 1.087@xmath4 , solar metallicity , and is a chromospherically inactive ( log@xmath3=-4.96 ) slow rotator ( v sin @xmath2=2.1 ) .",
    "hd  142 has a known stellar companion @xcite , which is a late k / early m star with a mass of @xmath50.56   @xcite and a projected separation of 105.1  au .",
    "the jupiter - mass planet orbiting hd  142 with a period of 339 days was one of the first discoveries reported by the aaps @xcite .",
    "a further ten years of observations have revealed evidence for a long - period signal consistent with a second planet in the system . in the discovery paper ,",
    "the one - planet fit had a root - mean - square ( rms ) residual scatter of 5.9 , consistent with the 34  estimated jitter for that star . using the formulation of @xcite , we now estimate a jitter of 4.5 , which we apply in quadrature to the internal uncertainties shown in table  [ 142vels ] .",
    "a one - planet fit to the current data set for hd  142 now has an rms of 31.1 .",
    "this significantly exceeds both the scatter due to the underlying precision of our aaps doppler measurement system and the predicted levels of stellar activity jitter expected for hd  142 .",
    "this excess scatter led us to investigate the possibility of one or more additional planets orbiting this star",
    ".    visual inspection of the residuals to the one - planet fit shows an obvious long - period signal ( @xmath6 days ) , and the periodogram shows a significant peak at very long periods ( figure  [ 142pgrams ] ) , so we proceed to fit a second planet .",
    "first , we explored the vast and uncertain parameter space of the long - period signal with a genetic algorithm ( e.g.  cochran et al .",
    "2007 , tinney et al .",
    "2011 , wittenmyer et al .",
    "we allowed the second planet to take on periods between 1000 and 10000 days , and an eccentricity @xmath7 .",
    "the genetic algorithm ran for 50,000 iterations , each of which consisted of typically 10003000 generations , during which the two - planet fits evolved toward a @xmath8 minimum .",
    "the best - fit system parameters from this process are thus the result of @xmath9 trial keplerian fits . used in this way , the genetic algorithm is an effective way of exploring a large parameter space , which is particularly important when the candidate planet s period is comparable to the length of the available data .",
    "we then used the _ gaussfit _ least - squares fitting code @xcite to obtain a keplerian model fit , with the best 2-planet fit parameters from the genetic selection as initial inputs .",
    "the two - planet fit has an rms of 11.2 , which is still somewhat higher than that expected for this star .",
    "a periodogram of the residuals shows a peak at 108 days ( figure  [ 142pgrams ] ) .",
    "we used a bootstrap randomisation process @xcite to assess the false - alarm probability of the peak at 108 days .",
    "the bootstrap method randomly shuffles the velocity observations while keeping the times of observation fixed .",
    "the periodogram of this shuffled data set is then computed and its highest peak recorded . from 10,000 such realisations , the peak at 108 days has a bootstrap false - alarm probability of 5.1% . in mid-2011 , this false - alarm probability was 2.5% - that the addition of new data did not improve the statistical credibility of the 108-day signal leads us to conclude that the signal can not be claimed as planetary in origin at this time .",
    "the residual scatter about the two - planet fit remains much higher than expected given the jitter estimate of 4.45  for hd  142 .",
    "however , the estimation of stellar activity jitter is a rather imprecise process , with uncertainties up to a factor of 2 ( j.  wright , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "hence , it is possible that we have underestimated the activity jitter for hd  142",
    ". a jitter estimate of 11.3  is required to produce a reduced @xmath8 of unity for the two - planet fit .",
    "examining the distribution of jitter estimates for similar stars ( wright  2005 , top panel of their figure  7 ) , the distribution has a tail extending toward a maximum jitter of 11 , but only includes 36 stars in total .",
    "@xcite provide a different formulation to estimate activity jitter , using the ca ii s - index .",
    "the mount wilson s - index for hd142 is @xmath10 @xcite . using the @xcite formulation , this yields an estimated jitter of 3.07 .",
    "based on the chromospheric activity index and the high log@xmath11 ( table  [ 142star ] ) , it appears that hd142 is an inactive dwarf star , which nonetheless presents a high level of radial - velocity noise .",
    "we note that this star is quite a rapid rotator : it has a v  sin@xmath2 of 10.4 , compared to typical planet - search targets which have v  sin@xmath2 of 2 - 4 .",
    "we conclude that the poor velocity precision for hd142 is attributable to the rapid rotation , which broadens the spectral lines and limits our ability to derive extremely precise radial velocities .    using a stellar mass of 1.15@xmath00.10  @xcite",
    ", we estimate the minimum mass , m  sin  @xmath2 , for the outermost planet ( planet  c ) to be 5.3@xmath00.7 .",
    "the 2-planet fit is shown in figure  [ 142fit ] and the planetary parameters are given in table  [ planetparams ] .",
    "the individual fits for each of the two planets are shown in figure  [ more142fits ] .",
    "thirteen years of aat data have provided evidence for a very long - period planet ( hd  142c ) with a period of more than 6000 days .",
    "the baseline of these aat observations is the longest currently available at high precision for this star , which makes independent confirmation of hd  142c problematic .",
    "a third candidate signal is present , with a period of 108 days and a velocity semiamplitude @xmath12 , which is comparable to the 11.2  residual velocity scatter about the 2-planet fit .",
    "it is prudent , then , to employ an independent analysis to test the plausibility of the 108-day signal .",
    "we analysed the aaps radial velocities using posterior samplings of different models and the comparisons of these models using bayesian model probabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used the adaptive metropolis algorithm @xcite for posterior samplings because it appears to be a reasonably efficient method for analysing radial velocities with keplerian models @xcite .",
    "we present the results using the maximum _ a posteriori _",
    "( map ) estimates and the corresponding 99% credibility intervals ( @xmath13 ) , i.e. the bayesian credibility sets as defined in @xcite .",
    "our prior probability densities of the model parameters are those used in @xcite , with slight modifications .",
    "we penalised very high eccentricities by setting the prior densities for orbital eccentricities @xmath14 , where the parameter @xmath15 was set to have a value of 0.3 that still allows the orbital eccentricities to have high values if the data insists so .",
    "we also adopted conservative prior probabilities for models with @xmath16 keplerian signals such that @xmath17 , i.e.  that the prior probability of having @xmath18 planets in the system is always two times less than having @xmath16 planets .",
    "essentially , this enables us to be more confident with the interpretation of our model probabilities  if there appear to be @xmath16 keplerian signals in the data , we actually underestimate the significance of the weakest signal because of these priors .",
    "the probabilities of models @xmath19 planets and the corresponding rms values are shown in table  [ model_probabilities ] .",
    "the velocity jitter was also included as a free parameter in the bayesian model , and the best - fit jitter values are given in table  [ model_probabilities ] for each of the @xmath16-planet models .",
    "these results support the presence of three keplerian signals in the data , although the parameters of the 108-day signal ( `` planet d '' ) are poorly constrained .",
    "the orbital parameters of this three - planet solution are shown in table  [ hd142_parameters ] .",
    "the distribution of allowed orbital periods for the outer planet had a substantially longer tail toward longer periods ( as expected given the data span is shorter than the expected orbital period for this planet ) . the large uncertainty in the period of planet c maps directly into large uncertainties for the eccentricity and velocity semiamplitude @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore note that the nominal 1@xmath21 uncertainties in the parameters of planet c as given in table  [ planetparams ] are likely underestimated , and we advise the reader to consider the 99% confidence intervals in table  [ hd142_parameters ] as more comprehensive .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of a long - period ( @xmath22 days ) , eccentric ( @xmath23 ) planet orbiting hd  159868 , based on 4.5 years of aat data .",
    "that fit had a residual rms scatter of 8.4 , which the authors noted as larger than expected for that star .",
    "they speculated that a second planet with @xmath24 days would substantially reduce the rms but , wary of the sampling difficulties in constraining planet candidates with periods near one - half of a sidereal year , they presented only the single - planet solution for hd  159868 .",
    "now , with nearly twice as much data ( table  [ 159vels ] ) , the single - planet fit has an rms of 15.8 .",
    "as is the case for hd142 above , the worsening single - planet fit gives a clue that additional planets are present in this system .",
    "here we adopt a jitter estimate of 2.65 , and apply this in quadrature to the uncertainties given in table  [ 159vels ] before performing orbital fitting .",
    "the fitting procedures used followed those outlined above for hd142 .",
    "interestingly , a 1-planet fit for hd  159868 now has an eccentricity of only 0.16@xmath25 , which is _ markedly _ different from the @xmath23 solution presented in @xcite .",
    "a periodogram of the residuals to this fit ( figure  [ 159pgram ] ) shows a large peak at 355 days .",
    "this peak has a bootstrap false - alarm probability @xmath260.01% .",
    "now armed with substantial evidence for a second planet in the system , we proceed with a 2-keplerian solution . for the final orbit fit ,",
    "we also include 4.3 years of data from the keck telescope .",
    "the best fit has a second planet with a period of 352.3@xmath01.3 days ( table  [ planetparams ] ) ; adopting a stellar mass of 1.087@xmath4 @xcite , the planet has m  sin  @xmath270.05 .",
    "figure  [ 159fit ] shows the 2-planet fit and the phase coverage for the new planet candidate , which has a period near one year .",
    "this fit has a total residual rms of 5.8  ( aat  6.7 ; keck  4.6 ) , which is still somewhat higher than expected based on the instrumental noise and stellar activity jitter . based on the somewhat low log@xmath11 values given in table  [ 159star ] , hd159868 may be slightly evolved .",
    "if hd159868 is a subgiant , the velocity jitter may be closer to @xmath55 , typical of subgiants @xcite and consistent with the rms scatter about our two - planet fit .",
    "a periodogram of the residuals now has a peak at 12.6 days , but it is not significant , with a bootstrap false - alarm probability of 27% . as a further check , we also performed a bayesian analysis as described above for the hd142 system , and we obtain model probabilities ( table  [ bayes159 ] ) which confidently indicate two keplerian signals .",
    "these results demonstrate how two planets in nearly - circular orbits can mimic a single eccentric planet when data are sparse and more subject to vagaries of sampling .",
    "this can cause signals near one year to be missed @xcite .",
    "while single planet systems can be fully solved with a simple keplerian analysis , gravitationally interacting systems of multiple planets require a full newtonian analysis .",
    "proposed solutions need to be shown to be dynamically stable over reasonably long timescales @xcite to be considered `` real . ''",
    "gravitationally interacting systems provide both an independent check on `` reality '' @xcite , and a useful means to constrain or solve for the orbital inclination angle and true mass of the planets @xcite .",
    "to examine the dynamical stability of the proposed hd142 planetary system , we performed a series of highly detailed @xmath28-body dynamical simulations of a wide range of potential system architectures .",
    "given the extreme uncertainty in the orbit of the outermost planet detected in the hd142 system , we concentrated solely on the orbital stability of the 350-day planet and a possible 108-day planet .",
    "as discussed in section 3.1 , there is a residual signal after fitting two planets ; the false - alarm probability of that signal is not presently low enough to justify claiming a third planet .",
    "however , if further observational data support the existence of such an object , it would be wise to understand the dynamics of the system . in this subsection",
    ", we explore the dynamical interactions between the known 350-day planet and the possible 108-day planet .    following previous studies of exoplanetary stability @xcite",
    ", we used the hybrid integrator within the @xmath28-body dynamics package _ mercury _",
    "@xcite to examine the stability of the planetary system as a function of its orbital architecture . following those earlier works , we considered two - planet systems in which planet  b ( the most well - constrained ) was placed on its nominal best - fit orbit ( table  [ planetparams ] ) .",
    "the best fit for a potential third planet has @xmath290.2 days , @xmath301.9 , @xmath310.16 , and @xmath3227 degrees .",
    "the initial orbital elements were then uniformly distributed across the 3@xmath21 confidence range in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and mean anomaly @xmath35 . in total , we tested 35 values of @xmath33 , 35 values of @xmath34 , and 25 values of @xmath35 , creating a grid of 30,625 initial system architectures .",
    "the semi - major axes for the innermost planet varied between 0.44 and 0.50 , the eccentricity was varied between 0.00 and 0.76 , and the",
    "mean anomalies were varied between 5 and 355 degrees .",
    "each of these systems was then integrated for a period of 100 million years .",
    "a body was considered to be ejected from the system if it reached a distance of 10  au from the central star . for each of the 30,625 potential systems",
    ", we obtained either the time at which the system fell apart ( through collisions or ejections ) , or alternatively found that the system remained intact until the end of our simulations .",
    "these results allow us to construct detailed dynamical maps of the system .",
    "figure  [ 142dynam4plot ] shows the results : detailed dynamical maps of the hd142 system .",
    "each panel shows the mean lifetime of the system , as a function of semi - major axis and eccentricity , with each coloured square showing the mean of the twenty - five individual runs carried out at that particular @xmath33-@xmath34 location .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the results using the nominal best - fit orbit for planet  b : the entire region spanned by the @xmath36 uncertainties on the orbit of planet  d is dynamically stable .",
    "the only departures from stable solutions are found at relatively large orbital eccentricities for planet  d , which cause the two planets to experience mutually destabilising encounters .    following these test integrations",
    ", we examined the most extreme case possible within the 3@xmath21 error bounds on the orbit of planet  b. we repeated the integrations exactly as described above , but placed planet  b on the most eccentric orbit allowed within the 3@xmath21 confidence interval , and at the smallest semi - major axis that interval would allow ( i.e.  @xmath37 au , @xmath38 ) .",
    "this was designed to give the system the greatest possible chance of instability  essentially to test it to destruction .",
    "these results are shown in panel ( d ) of figure  [ 142dynam4plot ] .",
    "in contrast to the integrations described above , the great majority of the phase space tested for this extreme scenario turns out to be unstable , although there remain several broad `` islands of stability . ''",
    "these islands are separated by a wealth of unstable regions , primarily driven by the web of mutual mean - motion resonances between the two planets .",
    "to better illustrate how the region of instability varies as a function of the orbit of a potential 108-day planet `` d , '' we carried out two subsidiary suites of integrations .",
    "these again covered the full @xmath39 range of @xmath33-@xmath34 space for planet  d , but with a resolution of 25x25x9 steps in @xmath33-@xmath34-@xmath35 .",
    "first , we placed planet  b on an orbit with eccentricity @xmath40 greater than the nominal value , and a semi - major axis @xmath40 smaller than the nominal value ( i.e. @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) . in the second suite , planet  b",
    "was placed on an orbit @xmath43 more eccentric than , and @xmath43 inside , the nominal values ( i.e. @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "these results are shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure  [ 142dynam4plot ] , respectively .",
    "thus , panels ( b)(d ) show the results when the orbital eccentricity and semi - major axis of planet  b are changed in @xmath40 steps from their nominal values .",
    "it is clear that the scenarios featured in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ 142dynam4plot ] reveal a far greater proportion of dynamically stable orbits .",
    "one obvious result from these dynamical tests is that when the eccentricity of a candidate planet d increases , the stability of the system dramatically decreases .",
    "the cross at the center of each panel in figure  [ 142dynam4plot ] shows the best fit and 1@xmath21 uncertainties for a third planet .",
    "the most recent data for hd142 now result in a higher eccentricity for a third planet ( @xmath460.1 ) .",
    "the results of our dynamical simulations , in which higher eccentricities for a proposed planet  d were less likely to remain stable , are in agreement with the analysis in section 3.1 : a 108-day planet in this system is increasingly unlikely .      to test the orbital stability of the two planets discovered in the hd 159868 system , we once again performed two detailed suites of dynamical integrations of the planetary system , using the hybrid integrator within _ mercury_. in the first suite , as for the first set of runs performed for the planets in the hd142 system , we considered scenarios in which hd159868  b was placed on its nominal orbit ( @xmath47 au , @xmath48 , etc . ) .",
    "we then carried out 30,625 individual simulations , through which the orbit of hd159868  c was varied across the full 3-@xmath21 range of allowed orbital solutions in @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( in a 35x35x25 grid , again as before ) .",
    "in stark contrast to the results for hd142 , which featured a significant number of unstable solutions , every single system tested for hd159868 remained dynamically stable for the full 100 myr of our study .",
    "following that first suite of integrations , we carried out a second test , in which the orbit of hd159868  b was set to the most extreme allowed within the 3-@xmath21 uncertainties , with @xmath49 au and @xmath50 .",
    "once again , we tested 30,625 unique planetary systems , with the orbit of hd159868  c varied across the full 3-@xmath21 range of allowed orbital solutions .",
    "these extreme runs did yield a small number of unstable solutions ( 162 of the 30,625 runs were destabilised by the end of the integrations ) , but the vast majority of systems tested survived unscathed until the end of the simulations .",
    "every unstable solution required the initial orbit of hd159868  c to have an eccentricity of at least 0.32 , and almost all featured initial semi - major axes of greater than 1.032 au .",
    "since the outermost object in the hd142 system has a very long and poorly - constrained orbital period , it is prudent to check whether the observed radial - velocity variation is due to a stellar companion on a much longer - period orbit . as noted in section  2 , hd142 is known to host a stellar companion ( 0.56 ) with a projected separation of 105.1  au .",
    "if this companion were the source of the radial - velocity signature attributed to the outermost companion , it would require the system to be almost face on ( an inclination angle of @xmath51 degrees for the derived @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "combining previous vlt - naco observations of the hd142 system , previously published in @xcite , and a more recent observation we made with the near - infrared coronographic imager ( nici ) on the 8 m gemini telescope ( figure  [ imaging ] and table  [ nici ] ) , we can clearly see the stellar companion moving almost directly towards the star which suggests a nearly edge - on system .",
    "the stellar companion seen from direct imaging would also have an orbital period of @xmath54 yr instead of the 6005 days ( 17 yr ) determined from the radial - velocity data .",
    "this evidence leads us to believe that the stellar companion is not likely to be the cause of the radial - velocity variation attributed to hd142c .",
    "in @xcite , we defined a jupiter analog as a gas - giant planet with a period @xmath558 yr and a small eccentricity ( @xmath560.2 ) . hd142c has a period of 17 years , @xmath57 , and a mass estimate consistent with a gas - giant planet .",
    "this planet thus represents a new jupiter analog , the fourth such planet discovered by the aaps .",
    "the three previous aaps jupiter analogs are hd134987c @xcite , gj832b @xcite , and hd160691c @xcite .",
    "this discovery of a new , very long - period planet provides additional evidence that continued support for the aaps is bearing fruit .",
    "we note that although the best - fit period for hd142c is longer than the duration of observations , the available data cover @xmath580% of an orbital cycle .",
    "@xcite investigated the extant literature and found that the minimum orbital coverage for published planets was 70% of an orbital cycle .",
    "the aaps data also show hints of a third signal with a period of 108 days , evident in both the traditional periodogram analysis and the bayesian analysis (  3.2 ) .",
    "since this signal still has a false - alarm probability of 5.1% , we do not claim it to be a planet at this time .",
    "we note that while very low - amplitude planets have been detected , with amplitudes comparable to the stellar radial - velocity noise ( e.g.  vogt et al .",
    "2010 , pepe et al .",
    "2011 ) , those detections were clearly evident in the periodograms , and the host stars were slow rotators with extremely low intrinsic jitter ( unlike hd142 ) .",
    "these discoveries also highlight the importance of continuing to monitor known planetary systems for signs of additional objects .",
    "in particular , both hd142 and hd159868 had moderately eccentric orbital solutions as well as excess scatter about the single - planet fit .",
    "a dedicated search pursuing this strategy was performed by @xcite , who observed 22 known planetary systems for 3 years using the hobby - eberly telescope .",
    "while that survey did not result in new planet dscoveries , the new data cast doubts on the existence of the proposed planets hd  20367b @xcite and hd  74156d @xcite .",
    "in both the hd  142 and hd  159868 systems , further monitoring has revealed additional planets , and the best - fit eccentricities of the previously known planets have significantly decreased .",
    "figure  [ compare ] shows the distribution of eccentricity versus semimajor axis for single planets ( open circles ) and multiple planets ( filled circles ) .",
    "a k  s test shows that there is only a 2.9% probability that the eccentricities of single- and multiple - planet systems are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "previous analysis of the properties of multiple - planet systems have given the same result : that planets in multiple systems tend to have lower eccentricities than single planets @xcite . to investigate",
    "whether this difference arises from an observational bias , we asked the following question : `` is there a minimum threshold number of observations @xmath58 for which single and multiple planets have the same eccentricity distribution ? ''",
    "we repeated the k  s tests on subsets of the known exoplanet data , including only those planets which have more than @xmath58 observations for a range of @xmath58 , as shown in table  [ eccdistrib ] .",
    "if there is a bias arising from the number of observations , then for larger @xmath59 , there would be no significant difference in the eccentricity distributions of single and multiple planet systems . the k ",
    "s significance levels in table  [ eccdistrib ] do not show any consistent trend with @xmath59 .",
    "we conclude that the difference in the eccentricity distributions of single and multiple planets is real and does not arise from the observational sampling .    both hd142b and hd159868c have low - eccentricity orbits near one year about stars similar to the sun .",
    "this raises the question of the potential habitability ( e.g. horner & jones 2010 ) of terrestrial moons which may orbit these giant planets , or trojan companions of those planets , a topic explored in detail by @xcite for hd  38283b , a gas - giant planet in a one - year orbit .    while it is somewhat speculative to discuss the potential habitability of as - yet undiscovered moons or planet - mass trojan companions of planets such as hd  142b and hd  159868c , it is important to note that , at least for our own solar system , the capture of objects to such orbits is now considered a well established part of planetary formation and migration . in @xcite , we provide an extensive review of the research into satellite formation and evolution , but it is worth reminding the reader of a few salient points .",
    "first , the combined mass of the largest satellites of the gas giant planets in our solar system typically amounts to  @xmath60 that of their host planet .",
    "in other words , it seems reasonable to expect that the most massive satellites of hd  142b could well be similar to , or somewhat more massive , than the galilean satellites ( since hd  142b is around 1.2 times the mass of jupiter ) , whilst those of hd  159868c would likely be slightly less massive .",
    "as such , the regular satellites of those planets ( assuming the same formation mechanism as the galilean satellites ) might well be somewhat too small to host sufficient atmosphere to allow liquid water on their surface . however , larger and more habitable satellites are clearly not beyond the bounds of possibility - particularly when one considers the possibility of the capture of massive irregular satellites ( such as neptune s moon triton ) during the course of the planet s migration @xcite",
    ".    a more promising alternative in the search for habitable exoplanets in these systems could be the capture of objects as trojans of the planets in question . within the solar system",
    ", it is known that objects can be temporarily captured as trojans for long periods of time , even in the absence of planetary migration ( e.g. horner & evans 2006 ) .",
    "however , it is now widely accepted @xcite that the migration of the giant planets resulted in their capturing significant populations of trojans . in the case of jupiter and neptune ,",
    "those trojan populations were captured on orbits of sufficient stability that they have survived to the current day .",
    "if either of hd142  b and hd159868  c was able to capture a sufficiently large planetary embryo as a trojan during their inward migration to their current location , it is highly likely that such an object could remain trapped as a trojan for the lifetime of the planetary system .",
    "if such planet - mass trojans exist in either system , they could well represent potentially habitable worlds .",
