    "we further orient each present edge either way independently with probability @xmath14 , and denote the resulting random directed graph by @xmath15 .",
    "this version of orienting edges in a graph , random or not , is natural and has been considered previously in e.g. @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be three distinct vertices and define the events @xmath17 , that there exists a directed path in @xmath18 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "in a previous paper , @xcite , we showed that , for fixed @xmath5 , the correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 asymptotically is negative for @xmath24 and positive for @xmath25 .",
    "note that we take the covariance in the combined probability space of @xmath0 and the orientation of edges , which is often referred to as the annealed case , see @xcite for details .",
    "we say that a probability @xmath26 is _ critical _ ( for a given @xmath13 ) if the covariance @xmath27 .",
    "we have thus shown in @xcite that there is a critical probability @xmath28 for large @xmath13 .",
    "( moreover , this is the largest critical probability , since the covariance stays positive for all larger @xmath29 . )",
    "we also conjectured that for large @xmath13 , there are in fact ( at least ) three critical probabilities when the covariance changed sign .",
    "based on computer aided computations we guessed that the first two critical probabilities would be approximately @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in this note",
    "we prove that there is a first critical probability of the conjectured order , where the covariance changes from negative to positive , and thus there must be at least three critical probabilities .",
    "our theorem is as follows .",
    "[ t : firstzero ] with @xmath32 and sufficiently large @xmath13 , the covariance @xmath33 is negative for @xmath34 and positive for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a solution to @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , for fixed @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40    in fact , the proof shows that holds uniformly in @xmath41 for any @xmath42 ; moreover , we may ( with just a little more care ) for such @xmath38 write the error term as @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that for large @xmath13 , the critical @xmath44 is indeed the first critical probability , and that the covariance is negative for all smaller @xmath45 .    in a random orientation of any given graph @xmath46 ,",
    "it is a fact first observed by mcdiarmid that @xmath47 is equal to @xmath48 in an edge percolation on the same graph with probability @xmath49 for each edge independently , see @xcite .",
    "hence the events @xmath22 ( and thus @xmath23 ) have the same probability as @xmath48 in @xmath50 .",
    "with @xmath51 it is well known that for @xmath52 this probability is @xmath53 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "hence the covariance in is of the order @xmath54 .    the outline of the proof is as follows , see sections [ s : pf ] and  [ s : lemmas ] for details .",

    "the latter covariance is a double sum over pairs of possible paths @xmath61 , where @xmath62 goes from @xmath19 to @xmath20 and @xmath63 goes from @xmath20 to @xmath64 , and we show that the largest contribution comes from configurations of the following two types :    type 1 : :    the two edges incident to @xmath20 , i.e=1000 the last edge in    @xmath62 and the first edge in @xmath63 ,    are the same but with opposite orientations ; all other edges are    distinct",

    "thus each such pair @xmath61 gives a negative contribution to @xmath67 .",
    "pairs of type 2 , on the other hand , give a positive contribution .",
    "it turns out that both contributions are of the same order @xmath68 , see lemmas [ l : type1 ] and  [ l : type2 ] , with constant factors depending on @xmath38 such that the negative contribution from type 1 dominates for small @xmath38 , and the positive contribution from type 2 dominates for larger @xmath38",
