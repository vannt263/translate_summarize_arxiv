    "the growth of br@xmath133 should however stop at certain higgs mass , since @xmath158 is in general dominant and grows more rapidly as @xmath148 increases .",
    "the peak position @xmath159 for br@xmath133 , which is the main reason behind the peaks seen in figs . 2 and 3 , marks the point where the growth in @xmath160 is overtaken by @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting to note that br@xmath133 always peaks at @xmath159 independent of the @xmath120 we choose .",

    "( 13 ) , one can obtain the branching ratio br@xmath133 for any higgs mass by simply scaling via the relation br@xmath166 .",
    "we note that the kink due to @xmath167 threshold becomes more visible for small @xmath120 values .",
    "this is because the @xmath168 contribution to the higgs width becomes suppressed and the relative weight of the @xmath167 contribution becomes more significant @xcite .",
    "such a kink is not apparent in figs . 2 and 3 because the @xmath169 case was used .",
    "the sm higgs width provides an upper bound to @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we can therefore use the narrow width approximation for @xmath172 gev .",
    "the cross section @xmath27 can be written as @xmath173 where @xmath115 denotes sm higgs .",
    "note that , with @xmath174 , the interfernce term can be safely neglected ( see appendix b for details ) .    to locate the peak of @xmath27 for generic @xmath120 , eq .",
    "( 14 ) can be rewritten as @xmath175 where we have neglected the interference term by assuming a large enough splitting between @xmath97 and @xmath90 . with @xmath97 and @xmath120",

    "this is exactly the case as seen in figs . 2 and 3 where such effect are most significant for @xmath181 since @xmath179 drops most steeply for increasing @xmath180 for this case .",
    "for @xmath3 , this shift becomes much smaller as @xmath179 is relatively flat .",
    "to illustrate our arguments so far , let us explore the  maximal \" and  minimal \" @xmath27 cross sections in the mass range of eq .",
    "( 9 ) , and @xmath107 and @xmath131 dependences .",
    "we shall also make some general discussions about signal vs. background and compare with other processes .      for  maximal \" @xmath27 , take , for example , @xmath182 and @xmath183 so @xmath184 , and the interference term in @xmath27 can be safely neglected .",
