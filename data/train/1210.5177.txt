    "these are avoided by stopping the iterations as soon as the unfolded distribution , when folded again , is compatible with the observed data within the uncertainties .",

    "the present situation in particle physics is unsatisfactory for two reasons : i ) there is a lack of comparative systematic studies of the different unfolding methods and ii ) the way to fix the degree of smoothing , the regularization strength , is usually only vaguely defined .    in the following section we introduce the notation and formulate the mathematical relations .",
    "in section 3 we discuss regularization and the problem of assigning errors to the unfolded distribution . in section 4 the r - l iterative approach",

    "the result of the unfolding procedure is again a histogram , the _ unfolded histogram _ , with bin content @xmath17 .",
    "we are confronted with a standard inference problem where the wanted parameters are the bin contents @xmath3 of the true histogram .",
    "it is to be solved by a least square ( ls ) or a maximum likelihood ( ml ) fit .",
    "we discuss only one - dimensional histograms but the corresponding array may represent a multi - dimensional histogram with arbitrarily numbered cells as well .",

    "these specific correlations are taken into account in most unfolding methods .",
    "an exception is entropy regularization @xcite which also penalizes fluctuations between distant bins .",

    "are mainly the point estimates which are obtained with a regularization that the user chooses according to his personal experience . in physics problems ,",
    "the error bounds are as important as the point estimates .",
    "the manipulations related to the regularization in most methods constrain the fit and therefore reduce the errors of the unfolded histogram as provided by the unconstrained fit @xcite . as a consequence , these errors depend on the regularization strength and",
    "do not cover the true distribution with a fixed probability .",
    "distributions with narrow structures that are compatible with the data may be excluded .",
    "an example for such a behavior is presented in appendix 1 .",
    "it is not possible to associate classical confidence intervals to explicitly regularized solutions .",
    "as stated above , standard error intervals are provided by fits without regularization .    in the iterative method",
    "the errors could in principle be calculated by error propagation but these errors would not be constrained and therefore usually be large and strongly correlated .",
    "furthermore their interpretation would be difficult .",
    "therefore it does not make sense to include them in the graphical representation . a very qualitative way to indicate the errors",
    "is presented in appendix 2 .    to document quantitatively the precision of the data , a fit with a small number of bins and without explicit regularization of the unfolded histogram",
    "should be done , such that by a wide enough binning artificial oscillations are sufficiently suppressed .",
    "the result together with the corresponding error matrix estimate contain the information that is necessary for a comparison with theoretical predictions or other experiments .",

    "these items , however , require some explanation to non - experts .    in case",
    "we have a theoretical prediction in analytic form , depending on unknown parameters , we should avoid unfolding and the regularization problem and estimate the parameters directly @xcite .",
    "a direct fit does not require the construction of a response matrix and is independent of assumptions about the shape of the distribution used to simulate the experiment , parameter inference is possible even with very low event numbers where unfolding is problematic , the results are unbiased and the full information contained in the experimental data can be explored .",
    "replacing the expected number @xmath10 in relation ( 1 ) by the observed number @xmath7 , the corresponding matrix relation @xmath38 can be solved iteratively for the estimate @xmath39 .",
    "the idea behind the iteration algorithm is the following : starting with a preliminary guess @xmath40of @xmath41 , the corresponding prediction for the observed distribution @xmath42 is computed .",
    "it is compared to @xmath43 and for a bin @xmath8 the ratio @xmath44 is formed which ideally should be equal to one . to improve the agreement ,",
    "all true components are scaled proportional to their contribution @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "this procedure when iterated corresponds to the following steps :    the prediction @xmath47 of the iteration @xmath48 is obtained in a _ folding step _ from the true vector @xmath49 : @xmath50    in an _ unfolding step _ , the components @xmath51 are scaled with @xmath52 and added up into the bin @xmath5 of the true distribution from which they originated : @xmath53    dividing by the acceptance @xmath54 corrects for acceptance losses .",
    "the result of the iteration converges to the maximum likelihood solution as was proven by vardi et al .",
    "@xcite and mlthei and schorr @xcite for poisson distributed bin entries . since we start with a smooth initial distribution , the artifacts of the unregularized ml estimate ( mle ) occur only after a certain number of iterations .",
    "the regularization is performed simply by interrupting the iteration sequence . as explained above",
    ", the number of applied iterations should be based on a @xmath34-value criterion which measures the compatibility of the regularized unfolding solution with the mle .    to this end ,",
    "first the number of iterations is chosen large enough to approach the asymptotic limit with the ml solution which provides the best estimate of the true histogram if we put aside our prejudices about smoothness .",
    "folding the result and comparing it to the observed histogram , we obtain @xmath37 of the fit .",
    "[ ptb ]    oscil.eps    of course , the mle does not depend on the starting distribution but the regularized solution obtained by stopping the iteration does .",

    "in most cases the detailed shape of it does not matter , and a uniform starting distribution will provide reasonable results .",
    "as may be expected , the speed of convergence decreases with the spatial frequency of the true distribution if we consider a gaussian type of smearing described by a point spread function .",

    "this means that high frequency contributions and artificial fluctuations of correlated bins are strongly suppressed in the r - l approach .",
    "the reason can be inferred from relation ( [ unfolding ] ) : the parameters @xmath63 of bins @xmath27 that are correlated in that they have similar  values @xmath19 , @xmath64 are scaled in a similar way and relative fluctuations develop only slowly with increasing number of iterations .    _ remark _ : by construction , the r - l method is invariant against an arbitrary re - ordering of the bins .",

    "the stopping criterion produces very satisfactory results in all cases . with the exception of the single peak distribution with @xmath87 events ,",
    "it is close to the optimum . here",
    "the observed discrepancy between the number of iterations from the stopping criterion and the number derived from the minimum of @xmath82 is due to the fact that the distribution consists of a flat region where few iteration are needed and the peak region which requires many iteration to converge to an optimal result .",
    "nevertheless also the solution with @xmath120 iteration is satisfactory .",
    "iterative unfolding with the r - l approach is extremely simple , independent of the number of dimensions , efficiently damps oscillations of correlated histogram bins and needs little computing time .",
    "a general stopping criterion has been introduced that fixes the number of iterations , e.g. the regularization strength , that should be applied .",
    "it has a simple statistical interpretation .",
    "its stability has been demonstrated for five different distributions , two different event numbers , two different experimental resolutions and three binnings .",
    "the results are very satisfactory .",
    "the present study should be extended to more distributions with varying statistics and binning and also be applied to higher dimensions .    in most problems",
    "a uniform distribution should be used as starting distribution , but the dependence on its shape is negligible as long as this distribution does not contain pronounced structures . in cases",
    "where the observed distribution indicates that there are sharp structures in the true distribution , the iterative method permits to implement these in the input distribution . in this way the number of iterations is reduced and oscillations are avoided .",
    "standard errors , as we associate them commonly in particle physics to measurements , can not be attributed to explicitly regularized unfolded histograms .",
    "we propose to indicate the precision of the graphical representation of the result qualitatively in a way that is independent of the regularization strength . for a quantitative documentation",
    ", the unfolding results without explicit regularization should be published together with an error matrix or its inverse .",
    "the widths of the bins of the corresponding histogram have to be large enough to suppress excessive fluctuations .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the r - l unfolding with other unfolding methods is difficult , because in most of them a clear prescriptions for the choice of the regularization strength is missing or doubtful .",
    "a sensible comparison requires similar binning and regularization strengths in all methods .",
    "the latter could be measured with the @xmath34-value .",
    "independent of the unfolding method that is used , in publications the values of @xmath22 obtained with and without regularization should be given to indicate the regularization strength and the reliability of the unfolded distribution .    whenever it is possible to parametrize the true distribution , the parameters should be fitted directly .",
    "i thank gerhard bohm for many valuable comments .",
    "[ ptb ]    svderror.eps    in most unfolding schemes the oscillations are suppressed , either by introduction of a penalty term in the fit , or by reduction of the effective number of parameters @xcite .",
    "both approaches constrain the fit and thus reduce the errors . as a consequence",
    "the assigned uncertainties do not necessarily cover the true distribution .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ svderror ] right hand side .",
    "the parameters of the ls fit have been orthogonalized with a singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite .",
    "the left hand plot shows the significance of the parameters which is defined as the ratio of the parameter and its error as assigned by the fit .",
    "the @xmath60 parameters are ordered with decreasing eigenvalues .",
    "a smooth cut is applied at parameter @xmath140 .",
    "contributions are then weighted by @xmath141 . in this way oscillations",
    "are suppressed that might be caused by an abrupt cut , similar to gibbs oscillations as observed with fourier approximations @xcite .",
    "obviously the number of @xmath93 effectively used parameters is insufficient to reproduce the peak and the true distribution is excluded . with the addition of further parameters oscillations start to develop .",
    "the problem is especially severe with low event numbers . with @xmath142",
    "times more events the discrepancy between the true distribution and the unfolded one is considerably reduced .",
    "regularization with a curvature penalty reduces the statistical errors even in the limit where the resolution is perfect .",
    "the errors presented by an experiment that suffers from a limited resolution may be smaller than those of a corresponding experiment with an ideal detector where unfolding is not required .",
    "[ ptb ]        the left hand plot of fig . [ ilustrate ] shows the result of a ml fit of the content of the @xmath142 bins of a histogram without explicit regularization for example 1 with @xmath87 events .",
    "the errors are indicated .",
    "they are large due to the strong negative correlation between adjacent bins which amounts to @xmath143 .",
    "the fitted values together with the error matrix can be used for a quantitative comparison with predictions . instead of the error matrix",
    "its inverse could be presented .",
    "the inverse is in fact the item that is required for parameter fitting . even more information is contained in the combination of the data vector and the response matrix .",
    "these items , however , require some explanation to non - experts .    the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ ilustrate ] shows a possibility to indicate the precision of an explicitly regularized unfolded histogram .",
    "the plot is based on the same data as in the left hand plot .",
    "the vertical error bar corresponds to the uncertainty of the bin content neglecting correlations and the horizontal bars indicate the uncertainty in the location of the events . in the absence of acceptance corrections",
    "the vertical error of bin @xmath8 is simply equal to the square root of the bin content , @xmath144 .",
    "if the average acceptance of the events in the bin is @xmath145 , the error is @xmath146 .",
